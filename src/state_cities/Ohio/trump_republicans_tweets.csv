Hell, Trump has bilked US citizens out of millions with visits to his own property - charging outrageous rates for Secret Service using golf carts and rooms and such.   Or is looting okay when rich white Republicans do it?

Trump unemployment rate is 11.1%, in April it was 14.7%.  Obama took office with 10% unemployment,  left with 4.7%.  Trump did have 3.5% unemployment at one point, but that was an improvement over Obama of only 1.2% and it was clearly part of the Obama trend.

Crazy coincidence that the CEO of the private company given the contract to deal with the COVID data from hospitals is a New York Real Estate mogul who has done Billions of dollars worth of financing with the Trump Organization!
That‚Äôs why I vote Trump because Biden has a failed record on foreign policy and helping strip working class of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Biden has been in politics since the 70‚Äôs (when he defended segregation). It‚Äôs time for him to step down from politics.
Trump is a doormat to dictators and a unhinged petty petulant crook.  He is no president. Nor an example of Behavior becoming of a political figure or grown man for that.
Hey Chip, I love you and trump deserves all the hate he spews smacked right back at him, but Barron is of minor age and therefore off-limits. We don't want to lower our standards to trumps.

One aspect of strong polarization is that people's beliefs about the news are driven by their beliefs about the parties, rather than vice versa.   Biden's been leading Trump by 8-10 pts for over 3 months now. At some point, people's opinions get burned in and won't be changeable.
i can't cancel the elections, i can't delay them, i'll demand speedy elections.  sorry bud is no right to a speedy election result..   trump seems oddly terrified this is not poles scared this is breaking news scared or something.

Cain made his bed, and now he sleeps in it. Everything to do with spreading disinfo to the general public because of his appeasement to Trump. That was his choice to be anti-mask, regardless of affiliation.
First, I'm not a woman.  Second, in the sociopolitical climate of right now, Trump hasn't expressed his condolences to Cain's family (or even Bernell Trammell's family). Hm, what do they have in common?  Third, his "poltical" opinion of masks is a deadly one.

Trump's lead narrows, Biden is declared winner in a number of states when its certified. Trump protests, Republicans protest and say Dems cheated, lawsuits are filed, and the Supreme Court has to rule on whether ballots should be counted after election day.
From a political discourse view the worst possible thing for this country is if Trump is leading on election night by a huge margin in all the swing states, but because Dems voting in mass mail-in and absentee, nothing can get called for almost two weeks (happened in NY).
Most people are really bad at weighing risk vs reward. Start with this person here who had preexisting conditions and   LITERALLY just died because of the virus. Shows up at a Trump rally saying the people are getting fed up about masks. Are you fucking kidding me with this shit?

What did he die of? COVID-19. How did he get it? He went to a campaign rally for citizen Donald Trump that specifically discouraged the use of masks and social distancing. Who told him to do this? Citizen Donald Trump. Who is a crocodile tear producing liar? You.

The media always smears the candidate on the other side. Fox did the same to Obama and CNN and MSNBC to W. I don‚Äôt know what that has to do with his Tweet? Also, mail-in voting has been on the DNC platform for a long time. Not everything is a mission against Trump.
Imagine your final thoughts in this world being, "I sucked up coronavirus while sucking up to a piece of shit like Donald Trump." That's just sad.
Biden and Obama gave us the ACA, an actual starting point. Trump has given us nothing but meaningless tweets and proclamations.
It has absolutely related. Trump and the GOP don't care about Black lives, unless they're indentured servants at their beck and call. Cain got played like a violin and in his death the wood was burned to burn him with.

Trump is meeting with Putin more regularly now.  We know Putin is coming after the election again.  The only question is how.    My bet is a principle part of Putin‚Äôs plan is to affect the actual vote this time.  And that mail in voting would thwart that effort.  That is why‚Ä¶

Larry Householder indicted and voted out as Ohio House Speaker, fact-checking President Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the November election, and Rep. John Lewis is laid to rest today in Atlanta, in 3News Now  :
I will support  Kamala, Susan, Elizabeth, Val or whoever Joe  chooses because any of them are better than Pence or Trump.
So you‚Äôre throwing your vote for a mentally ill ‚Äúslavery was choice‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarriet Tubman didn‚Äôt free the slaves‚Äù little man, are you dense? Kanye is a Trump supporter, there isn‚Äôt one possible way he can beat Joe Biden based on write-ins. Your vote is a waste.
sorry my point got interrupted.  even all the rwnj media together..   he only got 62m last time..  clinton 65m..  of 200+ total only q us how many fence sitters has trump motivated in which way. :)
Here me out. What if trump created covid-19 as a way to try to delay the November election. Crazy, I know. But what if?
That is exactly how I feel. If you are not for Trump now, you would be voting Biden or Dem. If they are truly undecided after three years and Covid, its remarkable. They are not really undecided, they are the "Shy Trump" voter.

Trump tweets attacks at Fox News from Air Force One: ‚ÄòNot even watchable!‚Äô | Raw Story
When Trump admin insisted states reopen against the advice of health officials they assured us that they'd be able to "stamp out any flare-ups." They never said how, though. Turns out they were just making up some shit and now people are dying so they're making up some more shit.
Good speakers don't necessarily equate to good men. That said, I certainly do not think Donald Trump is a good man.
essentially a dead heat--great for Trump
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Spoiler: unless he cheats, Trump is going to lose.
If this is how desperate trump is right now I think we are in for a tantrum filled 90 days

Obama Reveals The Thing About Trump That Keeps Him Up At Night - HuffPost
Time for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to start making plans. Their oath is to the Constitution, not the to the President or to Trump. The first thing Hitler did was have the German military make oath of loyalty to him.
I imagine we could have used the money that trump spent last year to have a ridiculous 4th of July celebration.  I see you are still pandering for your daddy trump.
Has Trump ever had Patio Pizza?
I couldn't agree more. Driving through a neighborhood with Trump's signs is disturbing. How can they follow someone who lies as he does? How is that acceptable?How is anything Donald Trump has done acceptable? I live in the inner-city. Diverse neighborhoods are the US, #UNITED.
Also when he flagrantly and irresponsibly attended Trump‚Äôs vanity rally in Tulsa without wearing a mask. Karma‚Äôs a bitch.
Trump and Biden are the best we can come up with? What more proof do we need that the American political system needs reworked
he can't even do watches right
Cain got the Corona virus from trumps rally in Tulsa. SO YEAH, WE BLAMING IT ON TRUMP!
So Trump uses the office of president to promote businesses who support him, and to rebuke those who criticize, giving advantage only to business owners who are pro-Trump. That's fascism; not the trendy term that ppl have been throwing around lately, but actual, real-deal fascism
Trump is DIRECTLY responsible for Cain's death! He got the Corona at that stupid Tulsa rally!

You are assuming trump &amp; the Republicans will follow the Constitution &amp; the law. They believe none of that applies to them.
Yea because Trump is such a good president who really unites the people. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Does Trump attract the stupid, or does he make people stupid?
Trump isn‚Äôt a troll-player, he‚Äôs an actual troll.
Oh yeah, he‚Äôs making money.
ITS ALREADY COMING...  You can only ARTIFICIALLY prop up the markets for so long before it crashes and burns...  The plan is to keep it going until Trump is out of office in January and then blame Democrats when it does...
You‚Äôre damn right, #WeWillVote out every Republican from Trump on down.
The riots in Richmond were also instigated by white supremacists under the guise of BLM, according to law enforcement. Neo-Nazi James Mason argued in the past that the goal is not just to kill minorities but, rather, ‚Äúto FAN THE FLAMES!‚Äù Trump also likes to fan the flames.
Nothing more pathetic then to watch a black man kneeling to the head of the KKK make no mistake trump is. who openly praises cops that murder black people and who only yesterday told white people to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù have their suburbs back and he gave them back their property values.
Herman Cain died doing what he loved - being a prop to support Donald Trump and the radical right‚Äôs war on reason, science, and compassion. He will be missed by his family, and few others. May he rest in pizza.
When u say congress do u mean the house or the senate or both? Because if it‚Äôs up to the senate, with those 52 trump sycophants ( I am excluding Romney) they would do it for master trump. They did it for master trump during impeachment.
Isn't PA under a mandatory mask order? Very impressive to see all those "cops for Trump" enforcing the law...
Oh, the Constitution.... well shit Trump can't argue with that.

Can't get more racist than this, What happened to fair housing. This is apart of the history of redlining, He also has a history of discriminating against black people.  Trump tells suburban voters they will ‚Äòno longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing
Trump making America great again one death at a time.  150,000 dead and counting!!  #MAGA #maga
Nah this country is not eating trump‚Äôs shit and calling it caviar. You are, but the majority of us had enough
Oh yeah? Here's how that scenario plays out in America, 2020 while Congress waits:  Trump flaunts your rules &amp; sends a tweet, Bill Barr makes it happen.   We file a lawsuit. All elections halted through years of court delays.  CONGRESS: be pro-active for once!  #DoSomething
I am very sad he died but Trump has blood on his hands you cannot deny that
Trump is a facist.  These people are idiots. And so are you. You support a facist,  a racist , a liar, a predator, a man who circumvents the Constitution at every turn. But hey, 2nd amendment , violating women's rights, LGBQT rights, all good, right?
He expressly mocked masks while inviting people to Trump's plague rally. My sympathies are reserved to all those he recklessly infected since then.
Have not seen a single person who has been posting about sex trafficking condemn Donald trump for wishing ms maxwell well. Both are atrocious
You wanna investigate Biden while trump over here thinking about postponing the election? What?!
It's almost like the people who oppose anti-fascism are actually violent and dangerous antagonists.  And that ANTIFA is a scapegoat made up by Trump to blanket any opposition to his fascism.
Well... he went to the TRUMP rally .. that TRUMP had to have.. so yea... its TRUMPS fault.. and the other 150k people as well..
and trump wasn't invited..   so he's getting attention with is fit about the gdp report and his desire to not be prosecuted after we kick him out in nov.
Why do I get no joy from this. I hope he becomes the glue that brings the people together to dump trump so that his death could mean more then just another trumpvirus death. #VoteHimOut
it's batshit insane.. which is now the gop brand so yeah the trump aiders will drink it up..
Don't try it Trump.
That the whole thing is a farce #1 children R def not going back 2 school although they should! #2 Mail in voting would B nothing but corruption #3 the virus&amp;Marxist movement is all part of the Lefts strategy 2 disparage Trump #DrainTheSwamp
It is very difficult to muster up sympathy for a man who mocked this virus and dared it to take him by not wearing a mask and attending a Trump rally. Well, the virus did take him and this hopefully will serve as a cautionary tale for those who are stupid enough to be like Cain.
Guaranteed Trump has never read the Constitution, nor does he care what it says, nor will he comply with. This is THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION where all laws, rules  and rights go to the WH basement to die a slow death. Everything else goes in the shredder.
The states hold the election, and Congress certifies.  Where does Trump factor into the equation?
I guess you lied about working on stopping the Coronavirus, Benedict Donald Trump we want you to stop tweeting about where to get a slice of pizza in New Jersey and get a national testing in tracing program going haven't you killed enough Americans without one
If I had gotten Covid I‚Äôd be asking for it ASAP....and I‚Äôm a Trump supporter. It works
Totally a hoax... Trump told me so!
I send my condolences to Herman Cain‚Äôs family.üôè However, he didn‚Äôt need to die this way. Trump politicizing Covid-19, insisting on holding large gatherings (in a hot spot, where staff had tested positive) and discouraging masks and social distancing- that is a crime.
Why is Trump talking about moving the election? To deflect the press from this:  GDP Drops At 32.9% Rate, The Worst U.S. Contraction Ever : Coronavirus Live Updates : NPR
The GDP fell 32.9% under Trump's "leadership." This is worse than the Great Depression (-26.7%).
What a hill to die on: defending Donald J. Trump's complete administrative failure and blatent corruption.  After all that he has done,  goes out at the lowest point of his career.   are you listening? #GOP?   Trump will take us all down with him.
Trump was charged though... you just don‚Äôt know how The Hague and Geneva conventions were set up to almost guarantee war crimes are charged in one way or another, or at least reported. DuMbFuCk

Clue version:  Trump killed Herman Cain in Tulsa with a microphone  #HermanCain
Whew.  I guess Them trump rallies will kill yo black ass one way or another.... #RIPhermanCain
What does one do at a tRump POTUS party?
Two things are very, very true today:   Donald Trump doesn't have a new tone and the Ohio Republican Party isn't suddenly committed to doing the right thing.
Trump's other white buddies didn't die from COVID but Herman Cain did. That should let every black Trump supporter know that cooning has a penalty bc the healthcare system don't see our pain the way they see white pain. Prayers to his family.
Going to a trump rally actually killed this man.
Maybe you should talk to an actual liberal, or anyone that doesn't like trump. None of what you said is true.
In theory if The Rock came out and smashed Trump in the face with a chair and declared he's running I would consider it lol
Out in plain sight for everyone to see but nothing will come of it. Just like GOP Senators selling their stock portfolio after an intelligence briefing in February on COVID-19... while Trump was telling America it‚Äôs a non-issue ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

wants to postpone the election, there is literally NOTHING he can do about it.  Not that the Constitution means much to him but "The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay in the end of Trump‚Äôs term ‚Äî noon on Jan. 20, 2021."
Trump wants to #delaytheelection.  The Constitution provides no mechanism for doing so. None. Period.  We literally held an election during the Civil War to prove the point.
Sad news about the death of Hermain Cain. Also a stark reminder about the danger COVID-19 poses to our older population  June 20 - Cain attends Trump Tulsa rally without a mask or social distancing July 1 - Admitted to hospital with COVID July 30 - Dead  Take it seriously people
Rest In Peace to Herman Cain. I don't wanna see any black man die but theres a lesson to be learned here. Herman loved Trump &amp; spread anti-mask propaganda. In 2020, black people PHYSICALLY &amp; MENTALLY can not afford to coon. I'm dead serious. We have much more to lose. Unfortunate
I will vote Trump out of office! #WeWillVote
If you want the right WH to do right by manufacturing, ask  whether he sees more upside with Biden or Trump. And listen to him‚Äîhe‚Äôs the gold standard.
Trump has made Congress irrelevant why is this any different?
I‚Äôm so tired of the games. I love what trump had done pre-pandemic but part of me wishes there was a third option. I feel like we are all just parts of the DC games.
Sad. As the old folks would say...ain't that about nothin'.  Also, as the old folks would say...the Lord works in mysterious ways.
. You killed #HermanCain with your Tulsa rally.  Are you ever going to own up to it???  #TrumpKillsUs #coronavirus #Trump
Trump is sending his Storm Troopers to Cleveland, my home, in an effort to tamp down the protests and violence. There are no protests and there is no violence. There has been nothing on the radar since May.  The debate is set to take place here. We'd rather drink Lake Erie water.
...but the lesser evil WON'T BE TRUMP! and I think that's the point.
black voices for trump ?lol these are the ones who would have turned other slaves into the master if they found out about an escape being planned.
because to this day near to 4 years into trump and fascist tactics the press is still in dreamy eye democracy is all fine territory trying to normalize stuff like this.  of course the fascists escalated.. kinda what they do..
Indeed. Let‚Äôs not forget that Obama won Ohio twice. Ohio can vote for progressive candidates, and no doubt thought it was voting for a candidate that cared about workers in 2016. Right now, Trump is running a Dixiecrat campaign that has nothing to do with Ohio.

The Working Class: please cancel rent, they're going to evict us and we'll lose everything.  Trump: cancel the election?  Democrats: give you free eviction lawyers?  Republicans: make your workplaces not liable if they force you back to work and you die of Covid?

The question wasn‚Äôt whether Trump would be convicted in court. Rather, the question was around intellectual consistency on the part of  . My guess is he will exhibit none. Don‚Äôt understand your statement about Biden‚Äôs comments not being a close call?

No surprise that Trump is trying to steal the election after soliciting China's help and asserting that unfavorable polls are fake.   you got anything for this?

Trump suggests delayed 2020 US Presidential election
Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky, a major leader of the U.S. haredi Orthodox community, said his followers should vote for Donald Trump in November. The reason? Gratitude. -
This deranged jackass is going to pull out all the stops for this upcoming election.
When trump became president
The economy has contracted 33% (economic catastrophe). How much longer are Republicans going to stand in lockstep with Trump as he doubles down on death and bankruptcy and joblessness?
Herman Cain (likely) got coronavirus while attending Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa. He died this morning. Politicizing a pandemic literally killed him. Unreal.
#HermanCain died of Covid 19. Diagnosed shortly after attending Trumps Tulsa Rally (mask free) He loved Trump to death, literally.
Are we steering into "Trump is nothing but a lib trying to sabotage real Americans" territory?
Herman Cain died doing what he loved - being a prop to support Donald Trump and the radical right‚Äôs war on reason, science, and compassion. He will be missed by his family, and few others. May he rest in pizza.
Condolences to Herman Crain's family. This selfish man chose to attend Trump's #Tulsa rally without a mask in some kind of sick display of his devotion to this pathological liar.
TL:DR - "What Happens if Trump Tries to Delay the Election  Trump can‚Äôt."  From
"Cain tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month, 11 days after attending President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma."
Looks like the mass murderer Trump got another one
Trump said he won't lose to Hillary in an election or body counts
Believing the Constitution will stop Trump is like believing the virus will go away. Because both require Republicans to do the right thing and you can‚Äôt possibly believe that will happen.
Herman Cain dies of COVID at 74. Diagnosed after attending Trump‚Äôs Tulsa Oklahoma rally!!!
Trump supporters: Make America Great Again by acting on the President's proposa - Boycott the November 3rd election! Show the Democrats that you won't participate in their rigged election!!
honestly nothing will ever be more embarrassing to USA than electing Trump
A valuable listen.  Trump will not leave power under his own power.
That Trump Tulsa rally was criminal. I don't share Herman Cain's politics, but he should be alive today.
Herman Cain died doing what he loved - being a prop to support Donald Trump and the radical right‚Äôs war on reason, science, and compassion. He will be missed by his family, and few others. May he rest in pizza.
does anybody else find it funny that the Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell just used Donald Trump to get some judges on the Supreme Court and at lower levels and now they want nothing to do with him
If it extended to January 20th, and no one is elected (including Trump), his term and Pence's term ends. Then, as is the law of presidential succession, the Speaker of the House becomes President. President Pelosi.

Trump: the unethical hack of a failed president
Herman Cain sacrificed his life to try to help Donald Trump get re-elected.  My god.
This is a prototype of the "Trump Lies" Big Lie. Trump was incorrect in using the word "bill" instead of "executive order" in his unscripted remark, but had he used the correct word would not have changed the intended meaning or understanding of what he said.
Another victim of Trump failure to take Covid19 seriously.

The laughable thing is that Trump is easily the most beatable presidential candidate in history.  This is the best candidate the Democratic Party could deliver??  Really??
Imagine dying because you wanted to go to a Trump rally in Oklahoma. Wild
President Trump, not attending nor invited...
No. Also, when Pres Trump installed a GOP fund raiser as postmaster general this summer delivery times immediately started to lengthen. Many are saying –¢—Ä–∞–º–ø is delaying the mail to disrupt voting. Congress must fund the Postal Service and restore service.
Of course trump wants to delay the election. He knows he is going to lose. I have a better idea - national mail-in voting starting RIGHT NOW.
trump defender=troll=Block. suck it, troll!
Trump is scared shitless because he knows that he WILL NOT win. He will go to any length‚Äîincluding postponing a presidential election (which he legally cannot do)‚Äîto remain in power. This is lawlessness.  VOTE. VOTE. VOTE.
Maybe you should tell Trump and his dementia riddled brain that he can't delay an election and mail in voting is completely constitutional. But go ahead keep taking a dump on this country to own the libs.
OH SHIT, Pelosi dropping the CONSTITUTION on Trump! Bah Gawd we got him now.
And the Trump campaign made attendees sign a waiver.
Trump thinks his twitter game is strong.....but trying to deflect everyone's attention with that election tweet and hoping not to notice that economic report isn't going to work
FUCK DONALD TRUMP! Get this fucking guy out of the office IMMEDIATELY !
Almost certainly caught at Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.   Rest in pizza.
Trump is setting stage for chaos so he can hijack the election, involve SCOTUS in hopes his two judge flunkies will vote for him 5-4.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail    Biden said it....Trump will try to delay the vote. Mail-in is the best option for those not wanting to physically go to a location.
Do not blame Trump for Herman Cain's death. Respect the man and say something nice. Herman was 74 and able to make his own calculated decision.  Rest In Power, Herman.
Across America Trump's political ads wreak of gloom, doom, &amp; violence. His "secret police" missions in Portland, Oregon, and his tacit approval of violence, beginning with his 2016 campaigns, attest 2 the fact that he will not let America out of his death grip without violelnce
Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget, Trump‚Äôs administration still has not done anything to address the fact that Russia was placing bounties on American soldiers.  But by all means, let‚Äôs continue to let Trump constantly change the subject
Now that Trump has mentioned it, it will be interesting the watch the shift. #Whiplash
We have literally the two worst candidates for President. Trump and Biden. As worst as 2016. I'm so done with politics.
LIE! Fuck Donald Trump.
If you champion Trump you are a clown. If you champion biden you are a clown. Blow the whole system up
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Wrong. Trump seems to conflate the two, which has led to misunderstanding, but they‚Äôre unrelated. Here‚Äôs the CLE PD‚Äôs press conf. on the matter; they make the distinction right away because Trump has handicapped them by his messaging.
Because he refused to wear a mask at the Trump rally.
Rebuild FBI building as low rent housing! Will pay Trump back for what he has done to America!!
Worth mentioning that Cain contracted the virus after attending a Trump rally. Maybe the passing of one of their own will finally force Republicans to take this pandemic seriously.To vote in person in November, I will wear a mask,  goggles and hazmat suit. TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏

lying pastor at John Lewis's funeral this morning g was rude enough to say Trump is the divider and a narcissist disguised as a patriot! At a funeral! Outrageous.
Contrast this to a Trump rally.
Pro life , trump 2020, police need more funding and higher wages,
I absolutely blame Trump's rally for the death of Herman Cain.
After reading Mary Trump's book and seeing her interviews it has dawned on me that Donald J Trump is not to blame for the damage he has done to this country. The man to blame is dead.  Fred Trump never taught his son to become a good person, or to value education.  More to follow
If said what I really wanted to happen to all people named Trump. I would be barred as well
Next to Trump. No maybe even ahead of him in the race for most evil human in the planet
Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book it‚Äôs all explained. He was never held accountable for anything in his whole  life. Now that Daddy Fred isn‚Äôt around to bail him out he‚Äôs floundering. We have an undisciplined child in the Oval Office. WTF. Those who voted for him should be held accountable!
This has been the goal of the right for decades. And they have been working toward that steadily. Now they have their champion in Trump. And their end result will be they screw up the voting by mail process.  Destroy thousands of good jobs. Privatize the mail delivery. Not good
Why do ppl claim packages they know they didn‚Äôt order! Curiosity! Strange! I got several fedex notifications of packages for me! I didn‚Äôt bite, because I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything from anyone! I‚Äôm pretty sure the dupes are Trump voters!

Donald J. Trump. And sadly there are still people who support this con man.
I thought it was Trump? It's hard to keep up around here.
Can't you see that Trump could exploit that to win the election??? That's got to be a lot easier than back channeling with Russia to buy Facebook ads.
I'll tell you what, you bring up a story in the last 3 years that paints Trump to look like a racist, homophobe, xenophobe etc.,, and I'll take you to the source of what actually was said and done. If we do that 2 or 3 times I think you'll start to see a pattern.
But they didn't, and they didn't do anything about immigration, trade, etc. All talk for decades. Then Trump came along and has done a whole lot of things that voters want done and that's why he's going to get re-elected. Further, the media blows everything out of proportion.
BS. The extreme left are the violent anarchists demonstrating to America every day who they really are. I support Trump based on policy, Period.
Are suburban women going to vote for Antifa, stay home, or vote for Trump?
Under Trump they were doing better than ever in history, how do you explain that Mr. 40 years in politics??
Because that's the kind but of idiot deals that tRUmp makes all the time! That's why he's such a failure at being a businessman and/or president!
How the hell can that be? JFC tRUmp supporting Republicans are dumb!
At first I thought Bill Barr, but then I decided someone that hates tRUmp would be a much better idea!

Um..that's actually a part of it. She was working there. Her dad lost his mind when he found out. That brought it to Trump's attention and Epstein got the boot. It's not complicated really
Trump is on the record saying those things. I know. It's hard.   But your inconsistently flippant disregard for reality is frightening  Being wishy washy gets you nowhere. You will have to choose sides very soon. Hopefully you autocorrect back to the right side of history
Democrats can rationalize anything their own people do. Quite a remarkable trait  Btw, Epstein was banned from all Trump properties after trying to recruit a girl at Mar-A-Lago

Therin lies part of the problem with Trump. No knowledge of how to do his job. No knowledge of foreign relations. No knowledge of the constitution. I guess you would rather have a plumber do brain surgery on you rather than someone with experience in that field.
Yet Trumps obvious Narcissism was not an issue  and he can pick out an elephant from a group of animals this is not rocket science people. And Biden will put competent people around him not the sycophants Trump put in place

Easy to see what side of history you will be.  It is not the Democrats..so you approve of the FBI building next door to Trump's hotel? Hey, that's in your bill. Wake up, I'm not sure you are speaking too. Times are a changing.
When asked if Trump Is a racist, a man recounts Trump giving Black businesses loans when they couldn‚Äôt get them from the bank.  He goes on to say Trump forgave the loans.
Dictatorship Bigotry Racism and more...are just as evil; also crimes against our country. Speak up against Trump or prepare for the consequences. As much as I dislike Jordan, at least he speaks his mind. You could have mentioned John Lewis..too chicken?
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?

Btw, you were completely lying about the circumstances of Trump calling Tim Cook, Tim Apple. He was not going around a table of execs asking them to speak.
Trump has no shame. He know no courtesy or respect.
Sir, this isn‚Äôt about the character of Trump/Obama. This is about the respect for life, whether unborn, black or white, old or young &amp; whether 9 judges agree w/me or not. History (&amp; I believe God) won‚Äôt be kind (nor should it be) how this country has treated blacks &amp; the unborn.

Trump has mad cow.
135 million mail-in ballots, 4 cases of fraud. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre concerned about. Trump has committed more fraud then voters.
He wore it up to the stage and took it off so he could speak.  I saw no one around him!  Where was Trump?
For a reason or was that a realization. The odds of all of them not being handled by someone is slim. Less likely trump is handled(ego is a plus in this case) it seems. But I don't know shit.
Trump got 5 kids by 3 different women. I have 0 kids. Who y‚Äôall gon trust about wearing protection? That‚Äôs right so wear your fuckin mask
He is an a$$hat. To do this at a funeral speaks volumes of what kind of vile person he is. Furthermore, Pres Trump is right that mail in voting is only asking for fraud. He wants everyone to vote but it has to be done in a correct way and not that illegals or dead ppl can vote
You forgot to mention he died of The Trump Virus!
Well, you need to talk to Donald Trump
First of all, democrats aren't "the left", they're still far right by .any definition. Second, people don't accept that Trump won because he didn't.

Trump is presiding over a collapsing economy. The GDP is down by 33%, a number larger than the Great Depression. And soon, Americans will be on the streets having lost their homes. All the while disease is spreading and killing. America needs a real President.#TrumpDepression
We all know it. #Trump
It isn‚Äôt the Democrats causing an issue. Trump slamming the postal service a trying to disband it. Ivanka built voting machines. Russian interference.
President Obama's speech at John Lewis' funeral is amazing and a testament to what great oratory can accomplish.    's speeches are as those of a 10 year old retarded child. Trump is a disgrace. Trump is a failure as a human being. Obama is a triumph as a man.
You will blame the Democrats for either outcome anyway. You need the Republican Party to exist and for it to give things for America to talk about so you'll get ratings.   I actually belive people like you and Jake Tapper will be genuninely bummed out if Trump loses.
Since Trump likes to call out Democratic cities and states for having high crime rates, would it be fair to call out Republican ran cities and states for having low income and being poorly educated?üò∑ü§î
No respect intended. Y Mr Trump break great American tradition. While our past presidents creat and celebrate the legacy off a great. Brave American hero. We will love u always Mr Lewis. History was and will continue by ur actions we look forward to carry on. Rip Sir.

What's with Trump complaining to Chris Wallace that the last 5 questions of the cognitive test he took were so hard that Wallace wouldn't be able to answer them? The test is intentionally designed to be easy unless you have cognitive issues.

Since Trump "went there" on the issue of housing yesterday, here's a great short film explaining how segregated housing and neighborhoods came about in the first place, and the consequences.
This is normal human behavior. Trump has made it normal to see child like behavior daily. Has he even spoken up about the death of Herman Cain?  Hopefully all will be back to normal soon. I‚Äôm so tired of this.
After 2016 I was actively hoping the Democrats would provide viable and sane alternatives to Trump. Instead they went even more off the deep end. And I‚Äôm supposed to just go with that because Orange Man Bad? No, not playing that game

Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain.
You are missing the point... you said that you wouldn't want to trust trump with your life... yet you backpedal once someone brings up the other candidates past and how she literally let American's die. She had all the power to stop their deaths and she choose not to...

Do they approve of Trump sending troops to Poland?
RIP Herminator. Herman Cain has died of Coronavirus after attending Trump's Oklahoma rally.  Let this be a tragic lesson to the Coronavirus deniers out there
I wonder what the total death toll of Trump's Tulsa rally is.  Herman Cain is just the most high profile death. There have undoubtedly been more that could be linked to that rally with no masks.
Thomas Jefferson never met Donald Trump.

This can lead to cultural displacement, when members of a racial or ethnic group who were longtime residents of gentrified neighborhoods are pushed out.  Trump is still living in the 1950's.  He doesn't understand that his plan for the low income housings has been done.

Holy shit, how did all these words get in my mouth?   So, if you think Bush was worse than Trump, okay.  He sucked and I can see that point.  If you think Regan was worse than Trump, okay.  But can you REALLY not see why people might think Trump is worse? I really doubt that.

I would like to see reporters routinely ask  "How Americans died of Ebola under Obama?" And then follow up with "How many Americans died of COVID-19 under Donald Trump?" Then just read back to him some of his Ebola tweets from 2013-2016.
"keep us safe"? Trump is the last person on earth who would keep us safe. Where have you been? We need a president who will stand up for the people, not just cops, and who will stand up for our troops, not cave to Putin who puts bounties on them.

Trump‚Äôs obviously first in his mind and actions. Country, family and workers are a distant last.
I‚Äôve studied Trump for over 30 years. It amazes me how he‚Äôs sidetracks the media and his enemies at will. They never catch on. This one was particularly obvious. While they are occupied, he will be busy getting something done. Too funny.
I am a conservative republican and trump supporter and will vote trump üíØ but I do see that his chances are slim. It‚Äôs frightening and alarming to think Biden managed to get this far SOMEHOW. people need to get informed on the issues and look beyond mainstream media before voting

Option 1 isn‚Äôt unfair, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD WITH MAIL IN VOTING, Trump saying it‚Äôs unfair doesn‚Äôt make it unfair. Trump also said there was voter fraud in the last election too with normal voting, so which is it?

When this happens (people realize trump is a menace to democracy), do they reevaluate their past defenses for him? Do they consider that they misjudged him and his past actions, or do they think that whatever pushes them off the train was the first *real* issue with him?
I also feel like Trump is going to try to postpone the election just so he doesn‚Äôt lose. Also feel like he‚Äôs going to try to get rid of term limits because of a video he tweeted that has himself in office longer than 8 years. Just cause I feel that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs right

Under Biden, we likely would have went into a recession at the very least ‚Äî possibly a depression. Our country never experienced anything like that before. Many should be thankful trump is president
Exactly. At least not all trump bashers are one sided and biased. Facts are facts. And covid is 100% at blame for the decline (as well as Gov enforced business closures and stay at home orders). Thankfully, we do have a businessman in charge that prevented a total recession.
No USPS, no bills!  I‚Äôm sure all the businesses in the country will be fine with that particular Trump idea.  #freefrommailfreefromdebt
That‚Äôs because of the liberals forcing government closures and stay at hone orders which resulted in a stalled economy and unemployment skyrocketed. Trump/republicans were against the government tyranny. They did that with this purpose in mind. But the economy is on the rise
Trump using the word "together" . It sounds so foreign.
But let's turn that around. Why do you think Trump himself hasn't come right out and confirmed it? And if you don't mind, what is the POINT of it in the first place, coding messages for random internet sleuths? It would change nothing whatsoever, even if it was true.

Trump can barey read his paper bc the words are too big. How embarrassing
Why don‚Äôt you just read things every now and then that challenge what you want to accept as reality? EVERYONE who knows ANYTHING about international politics and Russia knew what was up when Trump hired Manafort. These things aren‚Äôt a secret/hard to find and research.
I mean the way 2020 is going it almost HAS to end with the biggest disappointment of the year in trump somehow winning again
Trump is playing chess while the idiot democrats are playing clue with their bullshit ideas on how to get him out of office. I feel that he has moves up his sleeve to handle them
Here comes all the hilarious sound bites of trump dementia.
It amazes me how people just see what they want to see the whole world has seen how Trump has acted at his rallies,Throwing people out because he doesn‚Äôt like they‚Äôre protesting against him, he is a tyrant.
I almost don‚Äôt want Biden to win because I think the Senate will flip to Dems and House will remain Dem held with even more Dems being added and then Trump can‚Äôt do shit
People hear trump slur, too.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è They know he‚Äôs less fit than Joe and WAY less intelligent.
Absolutely amazing. The entire class of uncreative grifters that Trump has inspired never disappoint when it comes to the worst content you could ever possibly imagine.
trump ?
You‚Äôre right. My bad. Try this:  Trump is either being dismissed as a fool and a madman, or he‚Äôs the most influential man on the planet. It can‚Äôt be both.
Hey #LateForLunch! Should we delay the election?  We're not delaying yours. We're going to remember your enabling of Trump. GOODBYE
Donald Trump is talking about delaying our elections are you kidding me you talk about Crux he says it‚Äôll be the most widely fraudulent election ever because the people sending in their ballots that is there a God given right so you are full of crap crap
I won‚Äôt die for trump or the economy. After 5 months, how is this still a fucking political issue??? Wear a mask and stay home! That‚Äôs the best way to get back to a better economy.
Does Trump have shady debt collectors calling Merkel from spoofed numbers?
Yeah our friend Ryan is correct, but I truly fear this is the last free election we'll have in some time if Trump wins. The stakes are slightly higher than normal.

You're a Trump supporter and your bio mentions "needing to change your understanding of reality", while Trp lives in a fictional world where science isn't real and only certain types of people matter. That's very ironic.

Exactly. Humor. We need to humor trump until November.
Sadly, he loved Trump to death. LITERALLY I wish his family my condolences and the best. I just hope that they'll think about their future decisions more wisely. Especially when they're lives actually depends on it.
Trump has whatever power the Republican Senate and supreme court decide they want to ignore him abusing. That's scary. If they don't stop him, he can do whatever he wants.
Because they wouldn‚Äôt.  This scare tactic trump is trying to pull us crazy.
I know it feels like every time Trump does something everyone says ‚Äúthis is how fascism starts‚Äù but like... delaying an election is literally how every dictatorship has started.
I mean, the whole thing is up to Congress and the States. Trump has no say.  Which makes my previous tweet kind of pointless. Oops.

Another distraction. He is losing and struggling with a coherent strategy to win. He has used up all of his wiggle room. His same old song and dance is not popular. John Lewis fought for the people in this Country. maybe Trump will start an Adopt a Confederate Statue Campaign.

No, but if Trump's people want to wait until December to cast their ballots that is their business.
Eh-hem... A friendly reminder that you and this president are full of it. The president's OWN commission on the subject found zilch, nada, nothing. You'll be eating that nothing burger with a side of salty tears come January.

Pure evil.  They are masters at deception-projection. He is the ultimate ‚Äúpeople of the lie.‚Äù   Obama is preparing us in advance that they will not accept election results, even though they are the liars, and election cheaters. They absolutely hate that Trump won in spite of it

President Trump suggested delaying this year's election based on unsupported conspiracies about the integrity of voting.   He does not have the power himself to move the election date.

Anyone who thinks Dubya is better than Trump needs to look at pictures of children born in Al-Fallujah with horrific birth defects from our use of chemical weapons on Iraqi civilians.

That‚Äôs wrong.  Trump was at GHWB‚Äôs funeral.   I‚Äôm glad he isn‚Äôt at this one but it‚Äôs not because of a standard.

Hey  you P.O.S., you talk about the Trump rallying "killing Cain with Covid." Didn't bother mentioning he had Stage 4 Colon cancer. And your boss got 2 more electoral votes than I did in the primaries. #bloombergterminal
Donnie has the tv on and they all want to see President Obama. Trump and the Trumpettes like watching a real President talk so maybe some day Donnie could try to act like one.
I don‚Äôt message the mods on subreddits but this time I did. (Also not pleased with them stickying Trump propaganda when it‚Äôs convenient for him today)
To think that Donald Trump is in any way this man‚Äôs equal is something incomprehensible to me.
Right on cue you have republican yahoos like cornyn and mccarthy telling whoever will listen that the president‚Äôs delay the election tweet was a joke to freak out the media. Every time they try this tactic trump throws them under the bus by saying he was serious.
Agreed, If it wasn't for the fact that Trump and his admin. we're recommending it there never would have been a delay. But "Orange man bad" ideology made them purposely withhold a drug until literally everyone else had proven it's effectiveness in helping Covid treatment.
Correct, even your boy Trump has now decided to wear one, four months too late.
Herman Cain is responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask or socially distance in a very sparsely attended event. He could have lived if he made better choices. I want Trump gone, but us citizens have got to stop abdicating responsibility!
trump: Pitiful little guy.
On the same day the founder of Godfathers Pizza, a huge Trump supporter, died from COVID.
Trump is what is wrong
Correction. YOU are voting for trump. #Cult45
Trump just called a presser, naturally.
JFC dude, the guy had some health issues. He attended a Trump rally w/o a mask or distancing &amp; caught the virus.A month later Covid19 killed  can pretend it was something else if that helps you w/your politics but it won't change anything.
Trump just called a press conference.  Why?  1.  John Lewis‚Äôs funeral 2.  President Bush‚Äôs eulogy 3.  President Obama‚Äôs eulogy 4.  Herman Cain 5.  The GDP  He can‚Äôt allow those to be the focus.
She knows if Trump wins she loses the House. Trump will win and it will be a record breaking landslide like every other record he has broken. He not only breaks records he breaks Politicians.
If you write her name in your giving your vote to trump! Vote for Biden
The fact is, we don't know. He might have got it just after the rally. And Cain was known for having a mind of his own. I can't see him being swayed by a talking head on Fox, or by Trump.
If trump delays the election to the point January 20th hits... president  has a nice ring to it. It‚Äôs the perfect end to a horrible saga.
Trump: I want to delay the election. McConnell: Nawww.  McConnell and other top Republican officials rebuff Trump suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election By Amy Gardner and John Wagner
As a reader of the U.S. Constitution, I for one would welcome a brief interregnum to allow Speaker Nancy Pelosi to become the first woman to be President of the United States.   But that‚Äôs probably not what Trump has in mind...
but then again i got trump supplying vast amounts of money to animal agriculture because it simply wouldn‚Äôt survive in the free market by itself so what do we do now
Do you think lawmakers should push back the November election?  President Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, but it would be up to Congress to make the change.
What dream is that? To die while slavishly following Trump and disavowing science?

Trump does what Trump does. This constant meltdown daily by the media just feeds the monster.   He‚Äôs an internet troll that got elected President. We all know this. Stop acting like every insane thing he says is BREAKING NEWS CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
Herman Cain put himself in harm's way supporting someone who has done a tremendous amount of damage to our country. His mistake cost him his life. Trump will distance himself from this as much as possible.
I‚Äôm not one to pile on, but you were all so quick to jump up and down about Biden saying exactly what Trump would attempt to do.   Now that Trump says it, you are too scared to even name him.
Voter suppression tactics are real. Those tactics are as brazen as closing polling locations to planting seeds of doubt, especially among AA voters. Voters who make a conscious choice to not vote or vote in a way that helped trump win own this as much as those who voted for trump

He died from Trump's rally. This is on trump.
It's funny watching them all talk about God and Jesus when they're fawning over the anti-Christ. There's nothing godly about Trump but they worship him like a false god. They praise racism, hatred and fear-mongering, casting anyone else as "evil".
While I have always found your comments on trump to be entertaining, I am unfollowing you after this classless, disgusting tweet. Gloating about people dying is disgusting and wrong.
Isn‚Äôt it amazing the horribly uneducated Trump people saying this is being spun?  You know as do I that anyone dealing with Cancer has virtually no immune system so Cain was literally risking his life by going and he paid the ultimate price.
Trump.
can some states decide to not hold an election on 11/3? If so, would the final results be based on states that would hold the election on 11/3? It is likely Red states would delay, which wouldn‚Äôt help Trump, esp if TX and FL delay.
Both parties should come out and ask for a delay. Not just one side. Bc then it can be assumed the delay is for political gain. Trump has zero authority to delay, if a delay is necessary everyone must agree
I support trump only inasmuch as I support whoever wins the electoral college. But this is just a blatant power grab. No two ways about it.
Trying to be trump
Wish  and  would put effort into Ohio suburbs and exurbs.  Also, support to defeat the #3 Trump Sycophant (behind Gaetz and Graham) Gym Jordan in OH4.
Trump was right when he whined about nobody liking him.
I'd probably go to the ladies' room. Cowardly, huh? I don't think I would be working for a Trump supporter, tho.
Trump would be a pallbearer if Putin died. No one wants him stinking up the place at Lewis‚Äôs funeral.  #TrumpVirus
serious question. What do you think odds are that Trump makes it to Nov 3? If you don‚Äôt think he will, curious as to your opinion why he won‚Äôt. I‚Äôve felt for some time he‚Äôll bail but I‚Äôm just a dude in OH hoping he‚Äôll bail. So trying to get a politico‚Äôs thoughts.

Stop all this shit about racism. I was around when racism was going strong. Nowadays you people think everything is racism. You use the word race about everything and everyone. The blacks have come a long way and are doing great. Only hear about the lazy ones. GO TRUMP.
He died from Covid because he was high risk in multiple ways. The only person responsible for his death is him. Trump is an idiot so you can‚Äôt blame him
Trump has instilled so much fear into them their lizard brains took over and they couldn't use any kind of higher reasoning. So they turned to their corporate leaders who gladly lead them to the weakest dem candidate in modern history
Trump can't change the date anyway. Only Congress.
Top Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, reject Donald Trump‚Äôs suggestion to delay the election
Trump is sabotaging USPS. Do not trust your vote to USPS! Use a ballot drop box instead. They will be everywhere, including libraries. Keep your vote out of Trumps hands!
Change also doesn't happen with complacency, arguable dems were and have been complacent since obama took office. Many only care now bc trump makes them care and pay attention. The so called "brunch democrats" just want Biden to win so they can go back to not paying attention
He's wrong. Both chambers of Congress would have to agree with Trump on the matter, and since Democrats control the House, it's not going to happen. Also, SCOTUS will not give Trump anything he wants. Just ask how The Donald currently feels about John Roberts.
The salt/early drama in MLB this season is what I needed. Listening and reading about trump, covid, BLM, Nanking policy changes is exhausting.
Aside from that Trump is challenging democratic instructions in an unprecedented way. That‚Äôs my principle concern with him.
How huge was it that we flipped the House in 2018? If that hadn't occurred, Trump's wish of delaying the election could  have been feasible, since the GOP would have had control of the House, Senate, and Oval Office. Since we voted, though, he can't do that. Sucks to be him.
Plus we had multiple locations around the country where food bank lines were miles upon miles long. Trump did nothing to re engineer supply lines to get food to people, farmers were plowing crops under while food banks were overwhelmed.
U.S. economy suffered its worst collapse last quarter since the Depression, thanks to Trump‚Äôs fumbling of the COVID crisis. Guess his slogan should have been ‚ÄúMake America Broke Again.‚Äù
I actually agree with you. But one question:  how are you going to stop Trump from slowing down the postal service so that all mail-in ballots will be counted?
Trump is just playing a game with the left. They want to close everything down including schools because of how "terrible" the virus is. If one was to follow their train of thought, it only make sense to delay voting. Trump is pointing out what hypocrites they are.

Interesting look at the Trump family‚Äôs religious ties in Scotland.
Did they say this without irony?  The laws have not changed. What's changed is the Trump administration leadership's directives on how to operate.  The #NurembergDefense, of #SuperiorOrders, did/does not work.
Everytime I see one of these articles, I just laugh, because the journalists just miss the entire point of Trump's ego that we see presented daily.   NOT HAPPENING.
I wish half the hate directed toward trump was also directed toward the DNC. They're a bunch of sabotaging pocket stuffing assholes too, just a little less than what we have now. Two party system is BAD.
Trump man the Russian govenrment want you to be president. China documents predict sucess if you stay president during the pandemic since we will go more in debt, trade our realistate, and buy more chinesse products.
1. He can‚Äôt 2. He can‚Äôt 3. He can‚Äôt....also, just to play the what if game...if there‚Äôs no election Trump and Pence are out at the end of the term automatically and then the speaker of the house becomes president. That‚Äôs why #presidentpelosi is trending.
I‚Äôm glad you said this but the fact that you had to say it harkens back to all the ways the GOP has enabled Trump‚Äôs authoritarian nature. This rampant destruction of democracy must stop!

By Robert's uneducated tweet shows that Trump keeping Americans in the dark about Trump's deployment of 14,000 soldiers all over the world is working. He has succeeded in keeping his clueless sheep in the dark.
This is literally a tactic that Trump has been trying to do since the start of the pandemic (if not earlier) to ensure he wins this next election by eliminating the mail in vote option.. we literally just rally around this and ensure he is voted out in November.

Trump has no ability to delay the election (none, literally) and it‚Äôs interesting to watch the GOP House members scuttle into the sunshine to declaim that they would never support something that couldn‚Äôt happen anyway.   It‚Äôs like shining a flashlight into a can of nightcrawlers.
Herman Cain died from Covid-19 and /r/Politics thinks that is off-topic.  How the fuck is a former presidential candidate and current member of Trump‚Äôs admin dieing from a virus they let run rampant NOT on topic, exactly?

Why aren‚Äôt ballot drop boxes in this poll? They are the safest, most secure method of voting. You are not promoting this nearly enough, especially since trump is sabotaging USPS.

The reported unemployment rate before COVID-19 was &lt;5%. When Obama had those numbers, Trump claimed they ignored a lot of people who'd left the workforce, and that the real rate was over 10%. That had not changed under Trump, but suddenly under him the number was "good".
Hey Ohio - Just 6 months ago, the majority of those who represent us on a national stage thought that Donald Trump did not abuse his power or obstruct the very own branch of they were chosen to serve. Here's who stood and watched the spark turn into a flame:

just heard a commercial on 1460 from a group trying to sign people up to work the polls and saying they will teach you tricks to help make sure Trump wins. What in the actual fuck?
Great. Now tell Trump that:  1) voting by mail isn't voter fraud  2) lots of people should and will vote by mail to reduce their risk of COVID infection; and  3) he must give states time to count all of these votes and respect the results of the election regardless of outcome. TY

Trump speaks at a 4th grade level you think HE is gonna be like ‚Äúoh no we gotta increase the marginal tax rate on X product by X percent blah blah blah‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ hilarious you picture.

Dispatch: Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen
Hate to be redundant! But like my granny said! ‚Äú I‚Äôd rather have the whole world against me, than have one fool on my side ‚Äú ! Keep following trump, death awaits you!ü¶äWhen Trump is finally removed from office, I pray Tucker, Sean and the rest of his flock are removed too!
How is enforcing laws on the books racist? Please, please, please answer that. Every president preached, Trump took action. Did you cheer Obama when he preached it?
This is because real conservatives (not Trump) know that threatening to delay the election is the behaviour of dictators and autocrats who don‚Äôt honor our Constitution.

Really helpful framing of the Hydroxychloroquine war.  Whether you believe HCQ works or not, 1 thing is indisputable: the MSM &amp; Fauci are on the wrong side of this issue wrt risk management, and are willing to cost 1000s of people their lives to damage Trump politically.

At Lewis Funeral, Obama Lashes Trump and Calls Filibuster a ‚ÄòJim Crow Relic‚Äô
Don‚Äôt blame this in the Democrats, the  owns all of this, you had a chance to stop Trump, and you all looked the other way!  Hundreds of thousands of Americans are dead because of your party...
So, Trump floats an asinine &amp; Illegal idea and you would like us to believe that Biden and those who found it unacceptable are being ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù for responding to THE EXACT WORDS the POTUS spoke. Saying NOTHING is ABSURD!  Giving THIS POTUS the benefit of the doubt, dangerous.
I actually lost about 20 something followers on insta because of my support of BLM, anti Trump, and women‚Äôs issues stuff and to them I say:
you are the most. Dishonest, decisive and demented president in US history. You went even lower today when you used the funeral of John Lewis to make a political speech. And you call Trump dangerous?!?!
F no! Don't trust trump or Putin!!
Like I said all you do is insult, blame Trump, ignore pedophilia.
No, Trump can‚Äôt delay the election
Like trump cheated to win the last election? You can‚Äôt manipulate a mail in ballot but you can manipulate a voting machine like Russia did for Trumpy
We haven't even voted him out of office yet and Trump already is a sore loser.  That makes him a total loser!
'I don't want a delay': Trump rows back on delaying election but not on mail-in ballots
President Trump just threatened to take away YOUR right to vote. If you believe he‚Äôs right to do so, you are UnAmerican and support treason against the Constitution of the United States. We have a right to vote. That will not be suppressed.
Oh you mean like Trump, who is trying to suspend our right to vote?
Trump's done more to fight pedos than any other Potus and he's just getting started. I didn't see Obama take down Epstein. All you know how to do is insult, blame Trump and ignore pedophilia.
Scott Adams: "I tell you why Trump is medically correct and CNN might be killing tens-of-thousands"
4 years later and Conservative Inc still doesn't get how Trump operates and freaks out every time he plays political games with leftists. That's why he won and they lost.
They were never on the table Alex.   If you aren't aware by now, Trump often suggests an unacceptable proposal that freaks Democrats out to draw attention to an issue he thinks they're wrong about, but the MSM is misleading people about.  It's political strategy.
Trump really wants to delay the election. Wow.
He said so himself. Over 4 years of Trump proposing things he has no intention of acting on and people still don't get it and freak out.
Wow trump just made this pandemic sound like everything is hunkyfuckingdory! Someone better tell the 152k dead people!
A power hungry, NWO NEVER TRUMP GLOBALIST governor, who is scared of a virus,in bed with  Bill Gates, Clinton Foundation, involved one lots of corruption and big player in pay for play, an impotent legislature and  OHIO is WINNING!! AWESOME
I purposely missed but when I turned on fox to see if the funeral was over he was using his opportunity to give a campaign speech.  Yep he went there   He trashed Trump and talked about mail in vote.  Unbelievable
Dude you HAD to know everyone would hit you with the Epstein/trump/maxwell line. Are you ready for that conversation? Or is this just a tweet to appease trump and you‚Äôre too late for lunch to talk about it
Imma enjoy remembering this when Trump gets (electorally) run the fuck over in November.
I understand that feeling, given what‚Äôs happening in our lives today, but never forget...it was Bush and his evil cronies, many of whom are responsible for the politics of Trump, who lied to us about WMD and set the Middle East on fire!  The world has never been the same.
The only thing Henry Olsen apologizes for is if he rumpled Trump's pants as he services him.
Trump now has four more years of dismantling institutions, self dealing, terrorizing people of color, ruining our relationships internationally, capitalist deregulation, and permanently damaging our environment
Days or weeks later, all the mail in ballots are counted and it‚Äôs enough to secure the win for Biden. But since it‚Äôs after the first count, Trump refuses to accept the actual results
Consider this: Trump delays the election. His base votes mostly in person because of his anti vote by mail stance. He has an electoral college lead and the popular vote.

This should be all the reasons you need to vote Trump.

Do you have the sources for these memes? Would you like me to send some Trump memes? You claim that Dems are the ones who won't listen or change, but would you say you listen? Because instead of accepting the truth about Trump, you just blame other people and say they are trollin
RUSH: I'm not sharing this with you to frustrate you, folks. I think that the point here is once again the Democrats are not confident that they're gonna win this.
Eric Trump doesn't even have your number to text you, lol...but go ahead and keep feeding the sheep!
How the actual fuck did Americans fall for this jackass? Him and Trump both love race baiting don't they?
You also allowed Trump to run unchecked. You have lost all credibility. Time for the retirement home.
Trump supporters shit themselves when some governors delayed primaries (elections that were more or less created for the benefit of political parties after the Constitution was already written) yet they are completely silent and compliant when Trump wants to delay the general
Ohio peeps: since Trump is clearly going to try and steal/postpone this election, why not become a poll worker to help prevent it? Attorneys qualify for CLE credits as well. I dont want to spend 14 hours in a gymnasium during a pandemic but I will:
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
RUSH: It's amazing how the Democrats continue to fall for this guy and -- after almost four years -- still have no idea how Trump does what he does and why he's doing it when he does it.
Hey  Trump wants to postpone the election . . . Are you still concerned?

I *really* don't think the military will side with Trump.  I'm pretty sure the generals can't stand him.   Also- these are people who take the Constitution seriously, whether trump does or not.
There's a whole lot of crap a president CAN'T DO that Barr and McConnell have allowed TRUMP to get away with. THIS SIMPLY CAN NOT BE ONE MORE!
Trump must think we‚Äôre stupid or something
Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 election in a tweet Thursday. It is unprecedented in its explicit suggestion to delay the election. The President doesn't have that power. It would require a change of federal law and could not be put in place unless approved by Congress.
Early on in contracting the virus. Which almost never happens because symptoms don't usually show up until a week or two after you have it. It's not a cure or a treatment and the only reason it's getting propped up is because Trump's dumbass pushed it.
?????? "President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters were seen lining up for a rally in Pennsylvania after the death of Herman Cain. Cain, who was 74, was thought to have contracted COVID-19 at a presidential rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma earlier this summer."
This is why Trump won - the alternative candidate put forward by the GOP establishment is using a man's death to score political points against Trump and Trump supporters.  When this is what Conservatism Inc. stands for, I'll take Trump any day.
Propor context. "Sadly , there will be cruelty online at Cain‚Äôs expense. But the real cruelty, which has no shame or even recognition of its inhumanity, is the organized resistance of the American right wing under Trump to preventing tens of thousands of needless deaths."
Donald Trump is a dictator. Pass it on.
Conservative elitists are worse people and have worse judgment than Trump on his worst day.  McMullin not only is wickedly politicizing Herman's death, his claim of science denial is projection, given that more scientific evidence shows masks don't work than do work.
And this reminder: "In the hours before President Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, his campaign directed the removal of thousands of ‚ÄúDo Not Sit Here, Please!‚Äù stickers from seats in the arena that were intended to establish social distance between rallygoers."
If Trump uses covid-19 as an excuse to push back the elections the virus will quickly go away!!
And corrupt Trump is the one to do it? I feel like you might be missing something or not truly understanding. Because everything you just described is basically Trump. So how, in your mind, would you think that would make things better?
Herman Cain ‚Äî a former Republican presidential candidate, Trump surrogate and businessman ‚Äî died Thursday morning after a month-long battle with the coronavirus.
Well, let's say the GOP states move the election, and in doing so, miss the cut off for reporting the results to the House of Representatives...  If that happened, Trump is still *automatically* out of office at noon on 1/20.  It's not up to him to release power.
Adam, let's be honest here. You don't really give a shit one way or the other. All you care about is spinning and lying to try and make Trump look bad. Germany is behind in their NATO fees so we're bringing some of the troops home to get Merkel's attention.

Primaries are ran by the state. The Presidential election is ran by the federal government. Primaries aren‚Äôt technically covered by the Constitution but the general is. Trump has zero power to postpone a general election, presidential or not.

President Donald Trump is for the first time publicly floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
I am dumbfounded that Herman Cain died from a hoax. I guess people are willing to die for Trump...go figure.
The 20th Amendment states that the term of the President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January. ‚ÄúTherefore, if the presidential election were somehow not held, Trump would not simply continue to hold office,‚Äù according to law professor Edward Foley.
Maybe he shouldn't have attended Trump's COVID party in Tulsa. Maybe he should have constantly worn a mask.

Trump is just playing a game with the left. They want to close everything down including schools because of how "terrible" the virus is. If one was to follow their train of thought, it only make sense to delay voting. Trump is pointing out what hypocrites they are.
Nope. He‚Äôll hop on the nearest Trump jet and never set foot in the US again. Anything else will likely end up with him in prison. He‚Äôll go to a country that doesn‚Äôt extradite and live out his remaining years.

Absolutely.  I think the Left has been working on smearing Trump so much.   It‚Äôs made it difficult for me to know exactly what Trump is guilty of. If that makes any sense.
Senator Kennedy said he seen 175 million to a corporation for public radio. I wonder who has stock in it or is it trump trying to buy a propaganda radio station with tax payer money.
This decision was based solely on trumps rabid hate for Obama and his racism. Trump was a dictatorship and a white america. Might I point out that u r black and u r what he wants removed. Buy a backbone Carson and stop being his puppet. U should be ashamed.

Trump appointed a crony to run the USPS. He has financial interest in companies that will benefit from a destroyed post office and he is... yep, trying to destroy the post office.
Hearing the mashed potatoes story confirms for me that donald trump üçäis and will never get over President Barack Obama roasting him at that correspondence dinner.üëå
Obama helped 15 million citizens get health insurance - Trump is taking coverage from 30 million, his employment debacle has cost millions coverage as they lost their jobs.  Obama increased regulation for a cleaner, safer country; Trump has gutted regulations and regulators.
Trump unemployment rate is 11.1%, in April it was 14.7%.  Obama took office with 10% unemployment,  left with 4.7%.  Trump did have 3.5% unemployment at one point, but that was an improvement over Obama of only 1.2% and it was clearly part of the Obama trend.
We‚Äôll achieve peace when every network replaces Trump‚Äôs press conferences with Bob Ross episodes.

I think once it‚Äôs life and death, the political BS should stop. Trump feels otherwise. Respect to Herman Cain. He was a black man that ran for president! He deserves more respect than what Trump gave him. Felt like an afterthought.
Well, Trump‚Äôs funeral will be at Red Square, so Putin will be the speaker.   Hell, Putin might even put on a big military parade in Trump's memory.
He‚Äôs probably just saying this to be on the right side of history, so when trump contests the election he can say ‚Äúsee! I told you so!‚Äù
No respect for the dead. Herman Cain was a supporter of Trump‚Äôs and he still won‚Äôt acknowledge it as a Covid death. He still is blaming someone else. That‚Äôs not a leader, that‚Äôs a coward. I‚Äôm not a republican, but Cain deserved better from the President.

One aspect of strong polarization is that people's beliefs about the news are driven by their beliefs about the parties, rather than vice versa.   Biden's been leading Trump by 8-10 pts for over 3 months now. At some point, people's opinions get burned in and won't be changeable.

I hope all those leaning in to him, smiling, and wanting to be seen with no masks or social distancing are ok.  What a price to pay to be part of the Trump following!

If you‚Äôre not planning on voting for Biden in this election, please reconsider. Biden is not a good candidate. But he‚Äôs also not a dictator. Trump is openly admitting that he wants to destroy our democracy. We can‚Äôt fix our country if we live in a dictatorship.
Smh, right on cue 2 prove my point. Judging by the likes on ur comments we're at risk of this again. Our only hope is that weirdo Dems that voted Trump(due 2 this rhetoric) learned their lesson. We can't count on y'all 2 do anything but wish on a star we had a different system.

You know what my point was. Yes liberals are going to support the highest ranking woman in politics who is a democrat over the person who has destroyed the country. Tbh I don't disagree wit these points but I also don't do the moral high road to Trump's reelection thing yall do.
Nice story. All points were fried when you said "Pelosi doesn't care about you" and "only cares about money" as a contrast to/defense of Trump lmao. That was some move out the way of the lightning strike type shit right there.
If you support democracy you can no longer support Donald Trump. I mean you probably couldn't in the first place but now, really? Mail in voter fraud is something disproven so many times that if you still believe it because the president says so you're as dumb as he is.

The first time in my life I voted, WAS for Trump. i will do whatever is required to be able to physically go to the polls and vote for him again... even if I must crawl through broken glass!!   #TRUMP2020 #GODBLESSAMERICA
Yes trump inherited a mess.
He has a right to brag.  Unlike Joe Biden, Trump has his right mind. Why on earth anybody would want Biden in office is beyond me.  I believe the Dems want him in office with what they think is a good running mate then kill him off to have the VP REPLACE HIM.
They are not after Trump they are after us. Trump is standing in their way. I truely believe there will be mass blood shed befor we get our great country back

They want their citizens to die so they can somehow blame Trump
Here's a real world fact for you...the business I work for was busy but chugging along under Obama...as soon as trump took office they have and still are beyond busy. Plus my 401k was doing great until covid...b4 trump, not so much.
You keep saying trump is running on Obama's suscess...as far as the economy goes. Does that mean Obama was running on bushes economic plan then?
Trump had 60 million strong in 2016 we are looking toward 100 million strong in 2020. Democrats are so full of shit they dont know which way is up. You are more fake ass news. Go away
And we can‚Äôt believe you can stand by and allow Portland to be destroyed. Seems like you have bigger problems then Trump and the Feds. Should be recalled for not protecting you citizens and property.
Trump has an interest in undercounting the same people he denigrates and persecutes.  Don't let him get away with hijacking the census, too.
You would prefer letting the weak mayors and governors let their cities burn and disappear into chaos?  They can‚Äôt do their jobs so President Trump has to come in and defend federal property and enforce federal laws.
What is the matter with you. KKK, Nazis, stormtroopers, liberals seem to have obsession with calling Trump and his supporters names. I guess when the last liberals President was a total failure and you have no ideas on how to help the American people this is all that‚Äôs left.
Where are all of those "Tea Party" people that defended the Constitution ?? Trump and his goons have spit on the Constitution and are attacking everything that created this country..
Trump DOES NOT CARE about the election . He intends to stay in power. Right and wrong, good and evil, mean nothing to him. Trump is a PSYCHOPATH.
Next we will find out that Trump worked in the lab in China where the virus came from. Somehow the Russians will be involved and Nadler and Schiff will spend another 6 month doing investigating.
We all hope she keeps it up. Every time she opens her mouth it make is easier to elect Trump.
Trump hates The United States of America !! We the People love our nation !! We the People despise Trump !!

There is none. Trump wants a civil war. He has no idea what that means. The resistance in some of those cities is unknown to the public and the government. Gangs are better armed than any military in the world. They have not appeared yet.
Well that is, and has been violated many times by Trump and his thugs !! Trump has committed many war crimes and violations of the Geneva Convention. There are warrants out for Trump's arrest.
A civil war is coming. Trump and all evil beings (demon-possessed), thrive on chaos and confusion. The Word of God states clearly to RESIST THE DEVIL. !!!!
We are dealing with a PSYCHOPATH. Trump has no understanding of right and wrong, good and evil !!
He will not allow a legal election. Do you not understand that November 3 means NOTHING to Trump.
And I'm sure Trump and the the Republicans will go out of their way to sign it into law. Good luck with that.

Both parties should come out and ask for a delay. Not just one side. Bc then it can be assumed the delay is for political gain. Trump has zero authority to delay, if a delay is necessary everyone must agree

This can easily be resolved once Trump leaves and relations between US and Germany are normalized. Meanwhile, we make Putin more powerful over overdue "delinquent fees." It's nothing more than a petty Trump excuse to serve his master and advance payment for Putin's election help.
Germany too agreed. Reducing troop size there right now for not paying dues is a petty excuse that can be worked out after Trump leaves and normality between the two countries is restored. Let's wait 96 days. This move seems to be a down payment for Russian election interference.

And Trump is clearly acting again as Putin's useful idiot here. First he doesn't confront him on bounties for US soldiers and now this a few weeks later. This feels like payment for the 2016 election and a down payment for upcoming interference in the 2020 election.
I was paraphrasing Trump. He said Germany is not paying enough. So it's worse than the way I'm characterizing it.
Pulling our troops from Germany right now is a free pass to Russia and it says we are no longer protecting Western Europe from Russia. In other words, Trump is saying we are leaving NATO because Germany hasn't paid its overdue library dues. It's that petty. 97 days til election.
Also you know... I could totally see trump being pro redlining: "back in the 50s when our neighborhoods were safe"  Ugh

Man, everything this guy tweets is awful  1) mail-in voting and absentee are the same thing 2) there is no proof of widespread voter fraud from mail-in voting 3) Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to change an election date ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
We will vote in person or absentee and not allow primary mail voting. I know you TDS sufferers would love to expand your fraud, but we would prefer a legitimate election.  Also, let‚Äôs not forget that this group is a front to enrich failed Trump haters...
And I'm voting for Trump too to watch the economy sink and our country go to hell to make the Trump supporters crushed.   I don't care.  I'm old and will soon be outta here.

No doubt Trump is blasted more from media than any president I've been alive for, but some Fox News people are on that side also. Not just the left hate him. I can get you some Republicans that are against him as well. You can also find a lot of media that supports him

Wow didn‚Äôt know this virus started with Trump. Can‚Äôt believe the Trump virus hit every nation. Maybe cuz it‚Äôs not the Trump virus but China virus. It came from China and they lied to the world!

I thought we elected Trump as our president.  Why TF does Elfman thinks he's in charge of the whole country?
Donald Trump is a complete damn disaster even the Republicans are distancing themselves from him
Another reason TRUMP wants to get rid of the post office
Joe Biden takes black vote for granted.   Trump has tried to earn it with ACTION.   Biden said ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote Trump.   I say prove him wrong and vote Trump who has proven record that helped black community. He even banned chokehold and encouraged police reform.
Not every state was hit the same. He worked with the doctors along with cdc to advice certain states along the way but it was up to governors to know the circumstance they were in. Trump gave New York all the equipment they needed, it was bad judgment by Cuomo with nursing homes.
How the FUCK does anyone support Trump?
Biden voted for Iraq war that made youth like me go over and die in a place we should never have been. Then he and Obama pulled troops out and caused Caliphate to take over land. Leading to more troops having to go over there. Trump defeated caliphate and pulled out troops.
No because I know graphs can be misleading. You can show a graph that shows unemployment which is downward trending through obama years but I know that it‚Äôs harder to keep an economic expansion going at tail end of it. We go through cycles. Trump made it go the longest.
You can‚Äôt use graphs and expect to fool an economics major student. LOL. I know how complex economics is. We started from bottom when Obama got in, so huge job gains occurred. Trump gave it extra boost needed to create the longest economic expansion in HISTORY!
Pandemic hurt EVERY economy in the world. It‚Äôs who you trust to help rebuild it and I saw what Trump did for me and my family/community. I trust Trump over Biden in regards to economy.

He doubled the debt. Not triple. I should correct myself there. And yeah I do know difference actually. But with all that debt we accumulated look at how slow it took him. All 8 years. SAD! Slowest recovery since WW2. No bueno! Trump got economy to historic levels.
Well let‚Äôs get something straight first off. Obama tripled the debt but y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt complain about that... EVEN WHEN the economic recovery was the slowest since the Great Depression. Trump got in and look at pre-pandemic numbers! It‚Äôs crazy how much he did economically 4 us
Before pandemic hit that hurt EVERY economy of the world because of China lying, we had historically low unemployment, wage growth hitting 3%, stock market/401k soaring, 500k plus manufacturing jobs created. Trump will rebuild it back!!!
Because we shut down a booming economy to try to save lives. China lied to the world about the virus and the whole world suffered greatly. Trump will REBUILD OUR ECONOMY EVEN STRONGER THAN IT WAS!!!!
I see that as another awful candidate running for president with a bad person. Lol I don‚Äôt worship joe Biden like you worship trump. I don‚Äôt like trump or Biden they both suck. I‚Äôm not offended when you say Biden‚Äôs a bad guy cause I know both of them are bad ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Okay so like trump and his fascist tactics
Has ZERO to do with media...if you can‚Äôt see Trump is a dope on your own, then I feel for ya.
Destroying a country for almost 4 years is absolutely terrorism...so we should lock Trump up.
Can we have the first debate just be Biden and Trump taking a competency test live on tv?
Wake up America. The similarities between trump and Hitler are uncanny! Little reminder that antifa means anti fascist. Hitler and the Nazis are fascists. Any true American is against fascism!
Yeah idk why it‚Äôs so hard for you to realize you can say you‚Äôre apart of a group but not really. I can go kill a bunch of people and say ‚ÄúMAGA TRUMP 2020‚Äù and you better believe maga are all murders now too.
I assume that Trump will not be in attendance.
Ignore the imbeciles! TRUMP 2020! WE KNOW &amp; LOVE OUR POTUS‚ù§Ô∏è
Yea agree Trump and the GOP party paid each CEO in America 1.6 million dollars each folks. What a windfall folks. Why would they want to go back to work. That‚Äôs one hell of a bonus folks at our expense America the tax payers.
All things Trump is already doing/did.....geez, Joe.... have one original idea!
ONLY GOOD THINGS MUST BE SAID OF OUR DEAR LEADER GREAT WISE PRESIDENT TRUMP.
Hehe this dude doesn‚Äôt like the fact that Minecraft pixel art (which is almost like drawing stuff physically) got more views and likes than his trump stuffüíû it‚Äôs not even a tribute it‚Äôs literally just a picture put into Minecraft blocks
Trump asked the VP to attend. I don't know what all this uproar is about - in years past one of the roles every VP played was to pay respect at most funerals on behalf of the President.
You need a ‚Äúsoftball‚Äù category to appease Trump.  BLACK COMEDIANS NAMED ‚ÄòWHOOPI‚Äô (from SNL Jeopardy)
Trump has turned the WH into the Fuhrer Bunker.
Yeah sports without politics were the days. Now you can‚Äôt talk about mlb or nfl without SOMEONE bringing up trump ir kneeling or Whtvr else. I wanna talk about the extra innings rule and Shane bieber getting CY Young award possibly.
No they are the Russians agent Dictator Donald Trump's puppets
It is the Trump Administration---nothing new about the lying  here...
Hey Republican Party. Do you want Donald Trump to be President? It doesn't look like it. #realDonaldTrump
go figure---it is the Trump Administration...  Fauci: Some messages from Trump's task force don‚Äôt match reports from 'trenches'
We all know who Donald Trump is. But seriously how does he still miscalculate so badly even if an appearance would be 100% politically motivated? Doesn't even have the decency to take the high road and pay respects. Doesn't even seem capable.
Inappropriate to compare Trump to Nazi's, grow up, apologize and work together!!!
Inappropriate to compare Trump to Nazi's, grow up, apologize and work together!!!
How much trump weighs ?
And I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs focused on this the whole time. Tell me why he‚Äôs been going golfing instead of figuring out how to stop all this since he ordered for all the covid info to go to the trump administration and not the CDC and WHO who are literal scientists.
Trump didn‚Äôt mandate masks when there was proof it stopped the spread of the virus, he didn‚Äôt close states down after seeing that it worked. He wants to re open schools so kids can spread it and bring it home and kill more people. He‚Äôs disgusting and ignorant.
Where is the proof.  Even Trump hater Colin Powell doubts the story
A white Senator whose last name is Cotton fails to condemn slavery.  Trump‚Äôs America.
Constantly.  You should see some of the hate mail I get just for being a Vietnam vet who supports Trump
Trump was right when he said he'd win in 2016.
True everything is recorded in the book of life, with the Holy Spirit the records can be accessed. I told you Trump and you worked together before this life in Spirit or flesh I do not know. We are all connected by God but fight against it God Bless
We are not UNITED any longer, Trump has proved that.
We can‚Äôt let Trump turn this country into a dictatorship! We will all wake one day with a red flag over our heads!!
I question the sanity of anyone voting for joe biden. Seriously! Trump is far from an angel but he sure beats the alternative.
Quit whining! You sound like a 5 year old who can't get their favorite toy. Grow up already! Do some real reporting for a change and stop your daily bashing of Trump and/or republicans. Juvenile reporting!
Those same people have said Joe Biden is the same as Trump. Everyone is the same as everyone. So why vote at all? Bernie is Trump. Warren is Trump. Kamala is Trump. Everyone is the same. And yes, the people saying it serve one purpose: helping Trump. #LRT
He‚Äôs talking about the Reagan Foundation not wanting any association with Trump. As a red blooded American like yourself, I‚Äôm sure your support the right to protest peacefully. It almost sounds like you don‚Äôt. üç™
So what is trump trying to build support to do? Go to war, cut off trade, what's his end goal?
The crowd would have really hurt your feelings, and with your mishandling of the Trump Virus, they would have been even more brutal.
The Republican party is showing separation from the Trump administration and its looking bad for Donnie
(not like Trump would have been a Republican at the time lol)
It was a word play on "Kung Fu" to encourage people to get flu shots, yes i think its still poor taste to use that wording but its not really the same thing that trump is doing now.
Please remember the only reason Trump and his cronies are now promoting wearing masks is that they think it will help them get re-elected. They don‚Äôt give a shit about anyone except themselves. Someone told them they had to wear one and promote them to raise their poll numbers.Only the pres &amp; VP, bc until Trump decided otherwise for his own benefit, the Executive branch was legally forbidden to interfere with the Judicial--including the FBI. Blame Comey and Holder, all you want. But beyond that, you're wrong.
Donald Trump choose demon seaman over science (2020 has not peaked)    lol ... I wasn't paying enough attention to the demon-semen doctor I guess... I caught video of her pushing hydroxy and that was enough for me.
Just think where we would have been if Trump hadn't built economy to where it was.  You and Obama accomplished nothing on the economy in 4 years and now you want another chance to tax us into oblivion.  I do not think so.
If it bleeds...we only know one thing...destruction, hate of Trump and we know are days are numbered as a news organization...#FakeNewsMedia
And this is one of thousands of cases the FBI had. How is a VP supposed to know them all? Especially one that the FBI wasn't doing anything about?  Why hasn't Pence terminated the investigations into Trump, if VPs have so much power?
Obama takes EPIC swipe against Trump during John Lewis eulogy, gets HUGE ovation   Obama has plenty of sins under his belt... it's just kinda weird imagining how historians will frame this in a couple decades once everyone agrees on Spanky's fascism

Why didn‚Äôt Trump ensure his friend got hydroxychloroquine if it‚Äôs the cure for this virus?
Ohio vote Trump!
It‚Äôs been a rough day for them since he, once again, got up and acted respectful, empathetically and dignified and trump talked straight out of his ass, as usual.
People trying to educate me on trump,  youre worried about the wrong education sis ü§£
The likelihood of that happening is just as low as the likelihood of someone stealing your everyday mail. There‚Äôs really no statistical evidence to support this ‚Äúwidespread fraud‚Äù Trump is so scared of
Cenk is just like Trump, except Cenk talks about molesting animals
Yep. Duh?  This was obvious early. And the chaos #covid19 adds during this election plays into Trump‚Äôs hands. He sees no incentive to healing this pandemic.
It's animals or 100% anti Trump...we have zero else in content...We need to fold.  #FakeNewsMedia they have nothing on TV...close shop...
Wow shocking, too bad u already sold ur soul to trump a long time ago.
Funding for voting by mail would've helped by all your Republican delegation has opposed it, funny isn't it how after the morning tweet wanting to delay an election that all you've seem to changed your time. Trump had better get higher fences around his castle. You're need them.
Trump has a hard tune just reading a scripted text.
Trump sold US out to Russia and our country is in chaos. What are you doing about that?
So let's rush it so trump can get credit to save his presidency?  Nah I'll wait fir the medical professionals, I wouldn't believe you or any republican if you told me it was raining, I'd go check for myself skippy.
Trump Is Trying to Make America A Dictatorship   My friend
Imagine dying because you went to a Trump rally
You mean like how Trump repeatedly walks out of bill signing ceremonies with signing anything?
I carefully wish DJ Trump will get his butt kicked out of the Whitehouse and serve time. Be careful who you align yourself with Lindsey..
Ok I'm in. So the law will order YOU to spend time in prison, once you are not protected by your despicable job as president. Can't wait until you're Mr. Trump in stripes.
Easy to see what side of history you will be.  It is not the Democrats..so you approve of the FBI building next door to Trump's hotel? Hey, that's in your bill. Wake up, I'm not sure you are speaking too. Times are a changing.
When asked if Trump Is a racist, a man recounts Trump giving Black businesses loans when they couldn‚Äôt get them from the bank.  He goes on to say Trump forgave the loans.
Dictatorship Bigotry Racism and more...are just as evil; also crimes against our country. Speak up against Trump or prepare for the consequences. As much as I dislike Jordan, at least he speaks his mind. You could have mentioned John Lewis..too chicken?
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?
They are all kneeling and locking arms  I love the    That's a big FUCK YOU to Trump
Your boss didn't care about his life or other around him he chose his fate listening to Trump killed him so as I said I feel bad for his family that's it
Trump Admin:  position first. Evidence second. No, evidence ignored and taken down  Shameful.
Btw, you were completely lying about the circumstances of Trump calling Tim Cook, Tim Apple. He was not going around a table of execs asking them to speak.
Trump has no shame. He know no courtesy or respect.
Agreed, Trump has no right to delay the election. Thank you.
Undiagnosed learning  disability according to Mary Trump.
I think you should also affirm your support for our democracy, denounce trumps statement of attempting to postponing an ejection,supporting free and fair elections and stopping voter suppression and pointing out foreign interference. You endorsed trump, obviously corrupt senator.
Republicans who don't like trump are not his base. A base refers to people who are like 85%+ likely to vote for hom.
Like TRUMP, the crooks at FOX must have stock in the malaria drug.
Lol. That not even remotely what happened. Trump even tried to claim afterwards he said Tim Cook from Apple so fast no one heard it.

All of you that hate trump with a passion yet sit there and watch his press conferences just to bitch about it are hilarious. Don‚Äôt fucking watch it.
These kinds of people are absolutely no different than any Trump supporter.
Trump can't even stop himself from calling it the China Virus when he's sending condolences to a "friend" JFC
After reading Mary Trump's book, I realize a lot of GOP feel they have to walk a tight rope to protect what resources they can for their constituents.  You'd think he'd rather go out with a legacy of doing what's best instead of towing the party line.

When Trump is dead and buried and the long lines of patriots waiting to urinate on his grave have eased off, I might just start to begin to find a hint of compassion for his utterly deplorable followers
Trump has mad cow.
135 million mail-in ballots, 4 cases of fraud. I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre concerned about. Trump has committed more fraud then voters.
He wore it up to the stage and took it off so he could speak.  I saw no one around him!  Where was Trump?
For a reason or was that a realization. The odds of all of them not being handled by someone is slim. Less likely trump is handled(ego is a plus in this case) it seems. But I don't know shit.
Trump got 5 kids by 3 different women. I have 0 kids. Who y‚Äôall gon trust about wearing protection? That‚Äôs right so wear your fuckin mask
He is an a$$hat. To do this at a funeral speaks volumes of what kind of vile person he is. Furthermore, Pres Trump is right that mail in voting is only asking for fraud. He wants everyone to vote but it has to be done in a correct way and not that illegals or dead ppl can vote
You forgot to mention he died of The Trump Virus!
Not a fan of Biden I do know ain‚Äôt enough money in the world to make me vote for trump. The cat and mouse gane for his VP pick is like waiting to see who made the varsity cheerleading squad. OVERIT
Well, you need to talk to Donald Trump
First of all, democrats aren't "the left", they're still far right by .any definition. Second, people don't accept that Trump won because he didn't.
WE will not delay our election. WE decide. Not you, not Barr, and certainly not the demented Trump. #BlueWave110320
Don‚Äôt let Trump undermine our elections!
Pfft. He‚Äôs a useful idiot for Trump.
I interviewed businessman #HermanCain in Dayton back in 2016. He talked about then-candidate Donald Trump's appeal to disaffected voters. Cain passed away after contracting #COVID19 at Trump's June campaign rally in Tulsa.

No, those stats were not true and whatever countries may laugh will need due to the President holding them responsible for not pulling their fair share. Let them laugh. Obama, Biden and Co attempted to drive Trump from office which is treason. Indictments coming.
When we vote Trump out in November can we also banish him from America? And twitter?
Can Trump postpone or delay the election in November?

You're a white, cis, and probably straight woman, of course getting Trump out isn't yout priority, you'll be well off either way.
Sure. And let's hide the names of the other 150,000 American who have died from the trump virus. Let's hide all facts that can hurt trump's reelection chances.  Brilliant.
There is part of me that wonders if DeWine doesn't feel blackmailed.  He knows if he crosses Trump, Trump could pull all funding for COVID efforts in the state of Ohio.  That small voice inside wonders if this is all he can do to help us. The louder voice? That's another story!
Trump wants violence so he can unleash his own version of brutality and violence.  We are not Evil but Trump is!

Trump is presiding over a collapsing economy. The GDP is down by 33%, a number larger than the Great Depression. And soon, Americans will be on the streets having lost their homes. All the while disease is spreading and killing. America needs a real President.#TrumpDepression
We all know it. #Trump
President Obama's speech at John Lewis' funeral is amazing and a testament to what great oratory can accomplish.    's speeches are as those of a 10 year old retarded child. Trump is a disgrace. Trump is a failure as a human being. Obama is a triumph as a man.
You will blame the Democrats for either outcome anyway. You need the Republican Party to exist and for it to give things for America to talk about so you'll get ratings.   I actually belive people like you and Jake Tapper will be genuninely bummed out if Trump loses.
Since Trump likes to call out Democratic cities and states for having high crime rates, would it be fair to call out Republican ran cities and states for having low income and being poorly educated?üò∑ü§î
No respect intended. Y Mr Trump break great American tradition. While our past presidents creat and celebrate the legacy off a great. Brave American hero. We will love u always Mr Lewis. History was and will continue by ur actions we look forward to carry on. Rip Sir.
Biden is ass. But I am not voting for Trump lmao
Mr. Trump went on, ‚ÄúI had about 95,000 positive retweets on that. That‚Äôs a lot,‚Äù
What's with Trump complaining to Chris Wallace that the last 5 questions of the cognitive test he took were so hard that Wallace wouldn't be able to answer them? The test is intentionally designed to be easy unless you have cognitive issues.

Since Trump "went there" on the issue of housing yesterday, here's a great short film explaining how segregated housing and neighborhoods came about in the first place, and the consequences.
This is normal human behavior. Trump has made it normal to see child like behavior daily. Has he even spoken up about the death of Herman Cain?  Hopefully all will be back to normal soon. I‚Äôm so tired of this.
After 2016 I was actively hoping the Democrats would provide viable and sane alternatives to Trump. Instead they went even more off the deep end. And I‚Äôm supposed to just go with that because Orange Man Bad? No, not playing that game
Herman Cain made his fortunes on the backs of minimum wage workers, with no benefits and long hours in order to make him very wealthy. It's no mystery that he was a friend of Trump's. #ETTD!

It's time to stop being Nice to Trump. He's destroying our country and is an Evil stain on American history. You're not alone!
fuck all of y‚Äôall that voted for trump. fuck ice. fuck every cop. im so angry lmao. im going back to bed
Trump will kill more Americans than Hitler. Putin got what he paid for.
Trump's is Gross and perversely Vain! Who else wear blatantly fake makeup like that.
"Winning" will be prosecuting all of Trump's friends and family that are benefitting from this impending economic depression that Trump's leading us toward.
So at any moment we can be expecting White, gun-toting, confederate flag waving, little men to be storming the White House to "Peacefully" protest the Martial Law that Trump is floating.. Right? Right???
Trump's blatant interference in the mission of the USPS will be another reason to impeach him by voting him out! Trump's interference is slowing down commerce and personal communications for all Americans. His futile attempts will bear no evil fruits as it affects every American
The story is that karma is a bitch üòÇ I hope all republicans catch covid . Then they can thank Trump for this amazing misinformation he spews!
Trump ‚ÄúWhat do you have to lose?‚Äù
I don't even know how to react to this. Wow. Trump ego has directly led to the death of a high profile supporter. Unreal.
I don't think Herman Cain's death by #TrumpVirus will sway any Republican's responsibility to wear a mask to protect other people. Take one look at the fund raiser for Trump in Texas. Nobody wearing a mask including Trump. It's as though it's a patriotic notion to die of Covid19
The day GDP posts the worst quarter in US history Trump tweets we should delay the election.  That‚Äôs like my wife catching me cheating then me saying, yeah but I‚Äôm also cheating on you with 2 other people.

I don't believe in "distractions" because that implies there's a plan, but there's no plan. There's just chaos. There's Trump and his brain worms and that's it. And what people discuss on this platform is not necessarily what the public at large is thinking about.
Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain.
You are missing the point... you said that you wouldn't want to trust trump with your life... yet you backpedal once someone brings up the other candidates past and how she literally let American's die. She had all the power to stop their deaths and she choose not to...
So much blood on the hands of Trump, his family and his enablers.
Because he commented on Herman Cain's death without using it as an opportunity to bash Trump. We can't have civility like that in public forums anymore.
Do they approve of Trump sending troops to Poland?
RIP Herminator. Herman Cain has died of Coronavirus after attending Trump's Oklahoma rally.  Let this be a tragic lesson to the Coronavirus deniers out there
I wonder what the total death toll of Trump's Tulsa rally is.  Herman Cain is just the most high profile death. There have undoubtedly been more that could be linked to that rally with no masks.

The real Donald Trump. His voters are just a means to his ends. He cares not one whit about you.
Why does Trump still not understand that the 2% of GDP spent on military is not some fee paid to some mythical NATO bank?  He‚Äôs supposed to be a stable genius. Yes, there are NATO administrative expenses shared by member countries. But it has nothing to do with 2% he mentions.
Trump! You wouldnt understand law from order even if it stood on top of you, and pissed on your face while reciting the bible.
So Trump's incessant lying and confabulation is entirely intentional?
Why? That's idiotic and proves very little. Trump was just repeating what was in front of him at the moment.
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.

ü§îAs I said, #Trump has gone all out #racist, in a despicable, desperate attempt to appeal to white #voters. His reversal of President #Obama's 'Fair Housing Initiative' in the suburbs just the latest. As Sen. Murphy said, "its not even a dog whistle anymore", just straight out.
Are you voting Trump again?
I'm here,  representing the Marxists of the Groucho variety.  Trump is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Exactly; I'm tired ofvthe complaining.  There is no way that we can survive another Trump era.  I'm not worried though because there are some influential people that know the danger of Trump.
Nobody cares about where you were born and really at this point in the game, we don't care if you vote for Biden or not.  This election is to important.  Biden or Trump; sorry it's a no brainer
"and I don't even support Trump" üßê then why be so angry?
If that happens you already know Trump will claim "voter fraud" and try to cast doubt on the whole process
I need more boring politicians after Trump, I'm fine with it
OH-10, Trump+2
this is absolutely intentional. trump complains that mail-in ballots will be corrupt but the new postmaster general he appointed is ACTIVELY corrupting the process

Oh so you probably want Kamala then For VP for calling him on his past !? Cool. At least you can get behind the VP. Better than Trump, right? Or will you stay home if it‚Äôs not Bernie?
Sadly, unsurprising. Trump has no original ideas, &amp; that's not meant as a joke. Most of his presidency has been Heritage Foundation pulling his strings, cabinet/staff/donors feeding him their agendas; rest is just same shit he's always done. Tips from dictators checks out.
That makes no sense because Trump is the President now while it‚Äôs happening...
Can't wait to see Sarah Cooper's schtick on Trump's lament as to Dr. Fauci's likeability and his inability to figure out why "nobody likes me." Really, Mr. President? You can't figure that out?#NobodyLikesTrump

So you are OK with four more years of Trump, which will likely result in a dictatorship. Then, your issues will become irrelevant. The fight in November is to save the country from Trump.  The only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Everything else has to be set aside for now.
McEnany can't say why there's FBI building money in the coronavirus stimulus bill

Those ~3 months between Trump losing and Biden being sworn in are going to be fucking nuts
Sad to read. A bite for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. Biden will get you closer to democratic socialism solutions. Healthcare, food, housing for starts. Vow to remove Trump. That is step 1.
I dont know because trump has never been through this either and he isnt an expert so that being said anyone that says they could do better is a out right liar

The answer to your question, unfortunately, is yes, those lives are not important to the WH. I believe Americans would be very surprised at the number of lives Trump is willing to forfeit to achieve a poorly planned goal.
Buden possible has a clear shot at the Presidency. Trump, the sore looser that he is, will put us all through hell with conspiracy theories about how he was cheated out of the Presidency. This is going to be the worst election ever. They let a crazy man be President.

Maybe you mean Chris Collins? Duncan Hunter Jr in Cal. did the same thing. Maybe not so incidentally, they were the first two members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump.
Going to take  hydroxycloroquine tonight, seems safe from what President Trump says.  Would you agree it is safe?
There are good thngs about America. There are bad things about America. Donald J. Trump embodies every bad thing there is about America. #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Trump's coronavirus retweets spark claims of censorship  ‚ÄúWe're in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic, a pandemic. This is what I do," Fauci said. "This is what I‚Äôve been trained for my entire professional life and I‚Äôll continue to do it.‚Äù
See Trump doesn‚Äôt understand there‚Äôs rules to the flag!!
Good for You, Jim Jordan, you tell it like it is!!! You should be in the White House with President Trump!! üëçüèªüëçüèªüá∫üá∏
Because John Lewis and John McCain are two men who are infinitely better than Trump. They are everything he wants to be and never will, because Trump is a turd.
I can do the same about Trump so what
They hate  and want power that bad. If we don‚Äôt ran fast to the polls on November 3rd and vote for Trump

Democrat mayors are  watching their cities be destroyed by Trump's filth and lies meanwhile impose more restrictions &amp; closures on the decent people of the left to pick up the pieces.Remember that in November. It‚Äôs not enough to vote Biden. We need Blue ballots.  FIXED IT

Because it works and Trump came out right away and said it did. If it works he wins!
I appreciate Republicans who are trying to reclaim their party from Trump. May they be successful.
John Mitchell went to jail for a fraction of what Barr has done. That was just a bad case of lying. Barr is aiding and abetting a fascist takeover by Trump and the  GOP.
The current system lets Trump watch TV all day in the private residence, when he's not hosing us for another trip to one of his golf clubs. He is a fake president.
Same with this talk about a blue GA, blue WI, and blue TX(someday soon but not yet).....Trump is spending money here in Ohio like it's the ultimate swing state it used to be.....
This is why you absolutely must get rid of Trump, McConnell, Barr, Graham, and every other Republican up for election.

Because every body needs a sucker and trump is the biggest of them all.
HA HA HA! The visual in my head with him in diapers, like a baby makes me laugh even more! Baby Huey Trump!
Yeah. Good luck with that.   Aides try to absolve Trump of responsibility
They beat her because they are cowards just like Trump.  Off topic but : Trump even lied and made up this  üëáüëáüëáüëá

Trump had been so annoyed by Dr. Fauci‚Äôs turn in the limelight, an official familiar with his reaction said, that he had directed his aides to call Yankees officials and make good on a longtime standing offer from Mr. Levine to throw out an opening pitch.
Trump was be a groupie for-sure
When I was there. Trump Towers was bone dry.
If I was  I would be packing my bags and getting ready to move in to his new White House. Thank Melania Trump for the upgrades. Great timing btw.   and you have shown time and time again. You don‚Äôt belong!!! #nogoPVT
NESARA VS  NWO Trump VS Biden  America VS China Forgiveness of all debt VS  Be enslaved to debt 4ever Release all hidden knowledge to the public VS Vaccinations, lock-downs and tracer apps God VS Moloch Good VS Evil. What we accomplish in this life shall echo throughout eternity
With the exception of a few MOSs. American soldiers aren‚Äôt trained to deal with this type of situation. Dealing with elders in villages were basically dealt with by brass, LT, Capt,etc. Not our job. Trump is using it for all the wrong reason. That‚Äôs why he must leave soon!!!
Wow. The moment the cdc is sidelined and data goes straight to the trump administration things all of sudden look better ü§î  magic üôåüèª  Does he think we‚Äôre all this fucking dumb
It's important to remember that Trump is running from prison at the same time he's running for president. We've had scoundrels as presidents before, but they weren't actually fleeing justice while running for president.
I‚Äôm sure Trump thinks it‚Äôs a state.
It most certainly won't.   Democrats don't talk about Black issues.   The Clinic most certainly doesn't talk about Black issues.   Trump might bring it up though....
Worst President Trump
After the flack CWRU got in 2016 for allowing RNC security on campus without giving students proper notice, it‚Äôs pretty wild that they‚Äôd host the first presidential debate on campus.  They really all sat up there in Adelbert &amp; decided bringing Trump to campus was a good idea???
so now we just get to have it instead with all the coronavirus trump supporters..who‚Äôs idea was that
No, we just need to shut up the media
I have absolutely no use for the police and no interest in what they do any good they have done has been ruined by the atrocities they continue to do. Being thankful to the police would be like thanking Trump for all his lies on the Cornavirus.
Whoreticulture. Melania Trump Will Renovate White House Rose Garden - The New York Times
Milliary is forbidden to be on US Streets. Trump gassed people to get his picture taken. Both  and  are illegally in office. They are using mercenaries against US Citizens Even if arrested for a crime the police are brutal. The police do not get punished.

Well damn! That makes me want to get out there and protest even more. I‚Äôm one of those damn Mothers Trump should be afraid of.
It‚Äôs telling that Trump is in no danger of exposure to COVID-19 from his National Security Advisor.
Mein Kempf is Trump's favorite book. I bet at story time the kids did a wonderful job of reading to him!
Well, PERSONALLY, I still haven‚Äôt forgiven him for that or the crime bill. I don‚Äôt trust him on race since he‚Äôs been so chubby with segregationists-of which he was one. And, I don‚Äôt trust him to pick Kamala, although she‚Äôs the most qualified. But, he ain‚Äôt Trump!
Maybe they were rehearsing for the Trump boat parade along the NE Ohio shoe of Lake Erie September 5.
First of all, yes - fuck yes, every day, all day, #Medicare4All.  Second, it's a very simple solution - add it the platform.  It doesn't HAVE to pass, but they MUST fight for it.  And fuck those bitching about division in the party or a Trump 2nd term.  They don't really care.
Trump is lying  We are 19 in the world on testing. We are 1 on the death's We are 1 on infectionns
Okay have the top black lawyers across America teamed up to sue these cities who are protecting Trump supporters/nazis during their hate rallying and harming the citizens during BLM civil protest? Just a random thought
Trump gets 90,000,000 votes this year
Let him crap his pants on the show for all the world to see. How much lower and disgraceful can the Republicans go? Next Trump will be giving Alex Jones The Medal of Freedom
Can‚Äôt help but think that Trump is gearing up for not leaving in January.
In many circles it definitely is. It‚Äôs certainly getting more outrage from Trump.
WHO is in charge of these funds, BETTER NOT BE TRUMP! WHY aren't we USING THAT "SURPLUS" instead of going deeper in debt? As a taxpayer I DESERVE AN ANSWER!
AGAIN! Except we're dealing with a deadly virus, Trump DISMISSED back in Dec, 2019 as FAKE NEWS! The ENTIRE GOP ARE TO BLAME for NOT stepping up &amp; "doing the RIGHT thing" people NEED help NOW! ALSO, where the HELL are the "SURPLUS BILLIONS"of dollars from the PREVIOUS stimulus?
In theory, yes.  But you know there are those half wits who would counter with it being fake news and all that Trump inspired stupidity.   Betcha if they started arresting people for not wearing masks, that would really solve this thing once and for all.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Horrible. But Trump doesn't care. It's just a statistic to him.Trump wasn‚Äôt on the flight logs.
Trump rally in Pennsylvania today.  Very few attendees wearing masks in spite of PA mask mandate.  The campaign is actively shitting on the Constitutional authority of the Governor of PA. Am I the only one disturbed by this?

Let people make their own choices. People should have the right to take it if they want too! The drug has been politicized to the point where Dems are willing to kill people to ‚Äúown trump‚Äù it‚Äôs truly disgusting.
I see that, I think trump just wants to keep things afloat, as does the left. But in different ways . I still think we‚Äôre never going to get out of the huge hole we‚Äôre digging. Another depression incoming.
He was murdered by an Antifa member for supporting trump
22 people have died due to the BLM riots. Trump supporters are murdered and physically attacked.
Can you think of one thing you ever agreed with President trump or republicans on?
I think the dumbest part about it is that if it serves the interest of capital to build low-income housing or fracking or anything else in your neighborhood... Donald fucking Trump is going to stand in the breech. Because he gives a fuck about you.
Gomer 's belief on how he got the virus, I explain it to you.  It's like the reason a man got a girl pregnant was because he used a condom. He is blaming the pregnancy on the condom.        THAT'S HOW STUPID REPUBLICANS ARE AND THAT EXPLAINS TRUMP DUMB PEOPLE.

How will we regain our respect around the world. Putin has paid for himself a great gift by buying tRump! The fools that follow him in this country is amazing.
Yeah.  This about sums up the President.  It‚Äôs really hard to imagine that a person with so much power could be so petty. ‚Å¶
Also Why would the Taliban ever need more motivation to kill us, we are their enemy ! This whole story makes no sense. If trump asked he‚Äôd look like a damn loon. Just like you do for believing such a crazy story.
You know for a surgeon your reading comprehension skills sucks. However did you manage to make it through college? I said the original story was made up the the nyt, which at this point in time has as much credibility as the national enquirer. So why would trump bother ask him?
Russia has always been the enemy since I was a little girl. We would  practice nuclear attacks in grade school. We would like to get along with Russia, however they do not want the same things. tRump is a Russian asset that sits in our country highest office.
Rap music is materialistic garbage. Mac Miller has a song called "Donald Trump"
#TrumpPressConference Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, I like welcome you to the Presidential Comedy Hour with Donald Trump.  Trump: Wuzzup! Before I refuse to take any questions. I like to make a statement.. My esteem has gone up. It's great being saluted #1 but why use the middle finger?
Trump is a dangerous fool, once he‚Äôs gone it will be #demexit for this girl
That was horrible, Donald trump may have his downsides but at least he tries to stand up for democracy and fairness doing what is best for all. Hopefully isis stays dead.
üéß Always great to talk with Jon Bozeka  Listen to our conversation about Trump‚Äôs failures of leadership and our work to get real relief to struggling families and small businesses ‚¨áÔ∏è
No he means people who work (Of all colors) ! Trump has done more for the middle class and small business owner then joe has done in his Over 40 years in office. We middle class folks are tired of having to pay for social programs and welfare for the Useless and the illegals.
He was never on the island. Epstein and Trump both being billionaires run in the same circles. It doesn‚Äôt make President trump guilty. There is no evidence of such things, if there was it would have been spread far and wide already. Like all those bill Clinton pictures.
#TuesdayThoughts I don't get Trump's campaign reelection Law &amp; Order videos. To show the harm he brings to his people he said he would make GREAT, what people? Is this what America wants for another 4 more years. To live in a country more tailored to Putin's ideology not ours.
There are some who Love to see 4 more years of this. So, this is what you call GREAT? ü§îHmmm.. Nooo, you can KEEP it. Who would have thought after a few short years I'd catch a virus, be unemployed and live in a van down by the river. Thank You Mr. Trump ‚òπ #VoteTrumpOut
tRump is trying to kill us all! I think he thinks he could be emperor. ü§îü§îü§î

Don‚Äôt listen to trump trying to make people believe it‚Äôs from Mexico. Nope Cleveland Ohio and Savannah Georgia are two huge hot spots
Trump‚Äôs America
Trump for 4 more years!!!!! Whooooooo!!!!!!
I've said this before when President Trump first got elected that I thought he might be a double agent.I've watched very carefully how he's coming to power I've seen how he did it and now I found this once again watch this little video üòÇüòÇüòÇ üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÖ
You know the more I investigate President Trump further and further the behind-the-scenes kind of stuff that most of you don't see or want to see. I'm starting to see a side then I'm really not liking I might have to take that $200 I sent him back!
Having a pet in the White House is a tradition that goes all the way back to Jefferson which is one of my personal favorite presidents of all time because we think so much alike. And Trump would be the first president since Polk not to have a pet I don't like this,at all!
When it was reported last January that the Pences would be moving some of their family pets which include two cats, a rabbit, and a snake  Trump ridiculed the menagerie to his secretary, according to a longtime adviser. ‚ÄúHe was embarrassed by it; he thought it was so low class,‚Äù
Lol this is the most left wing liberal propaganda bullshit of a chart if I ever saw one.  It literally was made by ppl who say ‚Äúimpeach Trump‚Äù.   Welp.....here‚Äôs to 4 more years buddy
None of what I said dealt with Trump so you can take you‚Äôre edited chart down and chill out.
Ohio is definitely going for trump. Everywhere I look I see trump signs and bumper stickers. Not a Biden sign in sight.
Yes, we're voting for Trump in Ohio.
Not really we just get tired of talking to you. It never gets anywhere, your so programmed that you cannot see the truth when it slaps you upside the face. For instance, Did you know most of trump supporters voted for Obama? They aren‚Äôt conservatives.
tRump purposely sent them unknown federal agents in to the Portland with malice intent in his heart to start a violent uproar in this country. To get white suburban votes. To make white people feel unsafe in their homes. Shame on this idiot in The People's House. My God!
They dislike trump because he‚Äôs an outsider. He doesn‚Äôt play the same political games. American politicians are a highly corrupt group, on both the right and left. Mostly for their own financial gain. He was putting a stop to it and calling attention to it.
Most polls are just guesstimates when it comes to this election, no one really knows how it‚Äôs going to play out. Trump supporters typically aren‚Äôt the type to answer polls. Especially given how violent the left is, If they have your number they have your name.
Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt know anyone who ever feared putting an Obama sticker on their car or wearing an Obama hat. Yet the peaceful liberals maim, destroy, injure and even kill any notice of Trump support! Any thoughts on why Trump followers are silent-and growing?
The coronavirus is surging. Enhanced unemployment benefits are the last lifeline that millions of Americans have. Why do Donald Trump and  want to let them expire?
Ask trump about that
Trump has done far more for the black community then BLM has. How many black neighborhoods And businesses have been looted and burned in the name of black lives. How many needless Black deaths has there been because you guys protested and advocated to defund the police?
4) under president trump black unemployment reached record lows of 4.5 percent !
tRump's America!
YES !  Those are VOTES FOR IMPOTUS tRUMP !   148,593 DEAD AMERICANS !
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Both sides support black lives, in fact president trump has done more for the black community then Obama-Biden ever did ! As for BLM .. sorry your just a bunch of mostly white kids out for a good time ! I used to call you guys sheep but I think zombie horde is more fitting !
BUT WE WILL USE TAX PAYERS MONEY TO PAT IMPOTUS TRUMP $650 PER NIGHT TO STAY AR MARALAGO PLACE ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL BIG PAYMENTS BY TAX PAYERS TO tRUMP OWNED PROPERTIES
In six months, 144,000 Americans have died, 4 million have been infected, and we still don‚Äôt have a solid national strategy in place. I can‚Äôt help but think, at this rate, where will we be in six more months?
This a masterpiece of truth.  The great majority of Americans never bought into the Trump con.  We are indeed the clear will of Americans nationwide, and finally, come November, will will restore America to a nation of ethics and laws.
Trump brought up the secret police he sent to Portland and the only thing this clown could complain about was Fauci.
#SaturdayMorning cartoons  Trump's assistant: Sir.. Sir.. relax!  The mean old lady was just kidding,  They're not canceling Paw Patrol or taking away your favorite playset. You know, the one you use to pretend to arrest people of color. (whisper) can't  wait until November
#SaturdayThoughts it's sad when people think they're helping a candidate get elected by using fear. Can't believe some people buy it.I saw Trump's commercials on not having police.What stupid idiot thinks anyone would take away something thats offer protection to  its citizens?
They make shit up as they go along. It‚Äôs the trump admin‚Äôs culture, from him all the way down to his idiot supporters
Instead of working to save American lives, Trump is doubling down on his failed coronavirus response and endorsing my anti-vaccine, anti-science opponent. We can‚Äôt afford any more of this ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù
Trump has fought tooth and nail for years to avoid releasing his tax returns ‚Äî something every other president has done voluntarily for the last 40 years. Luckily, in this country no one is above the law.
Well tRump has open up a can of snakes.
We all go golfing! That‚Äôs what trump would do!
Don't worry people.  If sleepy Joe gets into office Corona will magically go away.  Whe. TRUMP wins tho.  It will kill a lot of people.
Riddle me this Batman: How would you characterize tRump Presidency? I hope to get a great response. ü§îü§îü§îü§î
It's sad to think that half the people I knew in 2016 potentially stopped being my friends because of Trump but now in 2020 I might be gaining 20% of them back.  #Election2020
I live in The Youngstown, Ohio area and all I see are trump signs and flags. Not a Biden sign to be seen . It‚Äôs not surprising though, the democrats gave up on Ohio. We are no longer a ‚Äúbattleground state‚Äù obviously Dems know Ohio is now a lost cause for them.
Black lives matters jump ship come 2 the GOP party!!!! And Trump promises he's got your back
If anyone needs a Robocop mask or a Trump Chi-nuh mask to piss people off, I made a store.
I think the whole administration has mental issues. There is nothing wrong with mental illness, as long as it is treated. When untreated mental illness is present you get tRump! We must hold ourselves steadfast and unmovable to vote tRump out. PERIOD!!
tRump will be next along with his Republican henchmen.
BLACK LIVES MATTERS MOVEMENT!!!  IF YOU DON'T COME TO WARREN OHIO THAT MEANS YOU ARE WORKING FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO CAUSE CHAOS TO BEAT TRUMP!
Tell me Trump what previous president is endorsing you? Who is willing to do a commercial with you? None ! What does that say about you? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump your next ! It started with you! So    better get on this! #trumpscoronavirus failure!
Just wondering how many of the protesters are Trump plants ! Just there to cause trouble!
I don‚Äôt think we are the only ones who have noticed! If they ask something he doesn‚Äôt like he will just walk off but that wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing ! I could do with less of Trump!
Excuse me but Trump may need to take it again! Biden has already proven himself he can speak in full sentences and has a much bigger vocabulary.
This video was filmed during Trump‚Äôs presidency
Screw him!  This is insane!  It is urgent that we get him out of office!!
It‚Äôs literally happening in Trump‚Äôs America..

You really need to lay off the kool aid. Trump evicted China because they were SPYING on us ! China is no friend of ours. You seem pretty stressed, maybe you should find a therapist or something.
You better tell trump to stop with political games first
Hey Chip.  Dr. Fauci said to start with 2 weeks and then see. The virus sets the time table. You don't want to admit that  the virus is in control and not you or us. Control freak like Trump you are.
They aren‚Äôt suburban moms, they are Marxists and if they live in Portland they weren‚Äôt going to vote for trump anyway. Most of them probably don‚Äôt even have kids. They are probably all ‚Äúeccentric aunts‚Äù and ‚Äúcat moms‚Äù
Look around you. Trump is the chaos.
Trump: Orange I have a joke. I told Obama "You know its called the White House not a person of color right? Obama said, "After November when you lose, it won't be call the Orange House neither." #Landslide2020 #VoteBlue #BlueWave
Not Trump! Not a scam artist!Imagine thinking this is any kind of meaningful tribute.  Trump didn't even stop by and pay respects. No class.
Sure I hate that Trump's a jerk.  But what I really hate is that 150K+ souls perished while Trump was being a jerk and he doesn't seem to care.
Maybe if reporters stopped letting Trump walk all over them, we wouldn‚Äôt have to scream. Reporters doing their job could have ended this 3 years ago. But it‚Äôs all about access, ratings and profits.
Seriously, nobody gives a shit about the Chinese Coronavirus. It's killed 150,000 Americans (likely only half that) out of 350 Million, yet we've closed the Nation, destroyed the Economy and refuse to open schools. Proof beyond a doubt, this is all about the Left beating Trump.
No, it was the Trump Virus

Even Fox News knows trump is a dumb ass.
68% of Trump voters are concerned.
Trump just tweeted about delaying the election.
Well, if you are going to get angry with a politician pushing a political agenda,  you're going to spend your life angry.   Save it for when  politicians puts their agenda above human life.  Trump does, Whitmer didn't.
Omg, an elected official spending 40 whole minutes on politics! Well, that is a crime.  You must really hate trump for all the time he spends pushing a political agenda.

yes.., and the FBI has informed us about how Putin uses theses bots for misinformation to spread confusion, division, lies, and voter suppression to help Trump win.  Trump is Putin's lapdog.
and let's not forget Trump's gestapos
That is happening now in Portland with Trump's gestapo
another Trump cult follower.., I hope you wake up and smell the coffee.
Thanks for the heads up,,  I knew Trump was pushing it for a reason., to help his buddy and himself.
is there anything I can do about YouTube spamming every video I watch with Trump ads? It sickens me how much YouTube is pushing that maniacs ads.

The difference is Biden has people around him whom he trusts to not poison his tapioca pudding and to bring him papers  to sign if he can stop drooling for a minute. Trump only has Ivanka, and the time will come he starts confusing Ivanka for Ivana and being mad about the divorce

Well, unless they are Boaters for Trump.
Is she paying for it with the money she gets from Trump every month to be his ‚Äúwife‚Äù? I sure as hell don‚Äôt want our tax money going to pay for this.
Accost means to physically approach someone aggressively. Something Tlaib categorically did not do to Trump. Yoho, on the other hand, approached AOC unprovoked and began to berate her to her face. He then disrespected her further when she walked away aka Workplace Harassment.
One thing for certain sure, Trump sure loves walls and fences and gated communities.  He doesn't much care for the hoi polloi.
It's ironic that some Vietnam war vets, who came back home to jeering protestors, are now the protesters and are being assaulted again, this time by Trump's Gestapo.
I‚Äôm not. My patriotism is standing up for truth while You cry like this narrative only exists under a Trump presidency and it does not. Not my fault you‚Äôre ignorant and don‚Äôt know how the Iranians and Iraqis feel about American success.
I never shop at Home Depot because of their active support of antiabortion policies and Trump support and I can find a substitute for Walmart. I hate to be played a fool. #GoodbyeWalmart
Love it, Brett Farve plays golf with President Trump, gets attacked for it. How many Celebrities hung out with the corrupt racist piece of shit Barack Obama and nobody said anything. Absolutely ridiculous.   #FuckBarackObama #FuckBlackLivesMatter #FuckJoeBiden #FuckTheLeft
Never use Wikipedia for Political reasons, it's just good for Movie plots, cast members and basically entertainment and sports information. Don't even try to read anything Trump related, it's worse than watching 'Fake News'.

I‚Äôll hold Trump accountable if he screws up. But this one is on Cuomo.
... complete control of Media (News, Social, Hollywood) that they can influence people with absolute lies and nothing will change their minds. We can't go to church or school, but they can riot for months. It literally doesn't matter if Trump is reelected, America is already gone
So beating and burning and killing and destroying is all because of trump?  Who raised this Hagan guy? You  took away peoples children, friends, etc.  You burned down peoples life dreams.  It's all been one massive childish hissy fit...
I brought it up because Trump is being accused of playing.
This is America. And people want to tell me trump isn‚Äôt a fascist
Question, is it time to start fighting the Left, fire for fire yet? Should we grab our guns and end the shortest Civil War in history? Will President Trump be able to classify #FuckBlackLivesMatter as a racist hate group that commits Terriorist attacks?
The Republicans ruin the economy and the Democrats fix the mess they left. Obama cleaned up Bush‚Äôs and now Biden will clean up Trump‚Äôs if he wins the upcoming election. If we get four more years of Trump this country will be unrecognizable.
Twitter, and throw Trump off of it.
...all the while they blame it on President Trump. Now they are setting up a legal stealing of the Election, while forcing us to wear masks forever. We might be screwed.  #FuckBlackLivesMatter #FuckAntifa #FuckAllDemocrats #FuckJoeBiden #FuckTheLeft  #Trump2020
I guess a year ago, President Trump talked with the President of Ukraine about massive corruption, which was possible linked to the Obama Administration (at least according to Joe Biden who admitted to blackmailing the previous President). That somehow led to President Trump.....
Does anyone wonder why Biden is leading the Polls? Trump voter's will bash Trump to not destroy their personal lives, and only support him when it really matters. Say you support Biden, no one cares, support Trump, you may be murdered. Silent Majority for a reason.
If you support trump, it means you support: -highest national debt EVER -tax cuts for the rich - $ to porn stars -racially divided nation -hiding tax returns  - 20k lies - bowing to Saudis and Putin - world leader in covid deaths  - nepotism  -kids in cages Still following trump?
Trump has destroyed all civility. So name call away.
Jesus Christ we can‚Äôt allow Trump to win again
Hilarious and you can't make this up. Democratic States are suing President Trump, so they can count illegal immigrants in getting House seats and Electoral votes; they are literally suing the President, so they will be allowed to commit voter fraud, WTF? You can't make this up.
#AmericasGreatestMistake was voting for a racist.,corrupt.,amoral, con man Trump as our President.
Additionally you are arrogant to think you know what‚Äôs in another person‚Äôs mind &amp; heart; that‚Äôs judging &amp; you have no authority to do that by simply stating your opinion as fact. When I look at Trump‚Äôs life I see Acts of Kindness w/no publicity but Others witnessed &amp; reported.
You‚Äôre so right; Trump has been prepared for this critical point in our nation‚Äôs path. This means we are all being ask to choose to join &amp; support this real war against evil or to ignore &amp; do nothing. Does lessons of Sodom&amp;Gomora come to mind. Is God going to find enough good?
this is the greatest country in the world we all need to start knowing that and believe in our president Donald J Trump he is the one we need to get US together as a country and when I say US I mean the United States of America thank u and have a blessed day
Then you haven‚Äôt analyzed Trump voters! One thing that don‚Äôt do is label a whole group with words, I hate... by way I have a Master‚Äôs degree! By way try listening Mark Levin and so of Black Trump supporters, like Thomas Sowell. They‚Äôre brilliant.
Yeah, Trump doesn't care at all sadly.
16 years ago, Dems were seen as less credible, less interested in defense / foreign policy.  Trump changed that.  (And Iraq hangover)
...combat it. Remember, these same people say the crisis at our Southern Border is manufactured, and that cow farts are destroying our Planet. We do have a pollution problem, but no one wants to focus on something we can actually fix. Thank God for President Trump.  #FuckTheLeft
Easiest way to trigger the Left, two ways, praise President Trump and point out that Climate Change is actually called Nature and happens no matter what people do or don't do. The Climate Change crisis doesn't exist, yet Democrats want to spend a few hundred trillion dollars to..
Remember when Donald Trump put an ad in a newspaper demanding the execution of 5 innocent boys accused of rape bc they were black. Yeah that guy is the president.
Do you think Trump will move out of the country when he looses? It‚Äôs going get HOT for him here with all the criminal investigations.
And hydroxychloroquine has been found to help Covid-19 patients recovery and reduce likelihood of death. üëèüèº   Can‚Äôt use that anymore since Trump was right. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Don‚Äôt understand if you can put all this out there , why can‚Äôt the case be made to remove trump NoW and send them all to jail for life!
Everything trump has said and will  say, is and has been a lie.
Great maybe they will get a statue of military base named for them. Trump seems to love successionist.
And they know that Trump will lose his re-election.., they are scared because they know he's hated and that he's behind Biden in the polls in Texas.,Florida.,Pennsylvania.,should I name more States?  Even Fox News and Senate Republicans know that Trump is in trouble.
Trump really does have some stupid looking hair.
No Scott you were washed up long before trump go back under your assigned rock.
Ever asked yourself who has been putting Covid-19 on a pedastol the most? Definitely, not republicans nor Trump. If a cult mindset has been made from Covid-19 it‚Äôs definitely a Leftist/Democrat push.   Fact: You‚Äôre more likely to die from the Flu even after a vaccine than Covid.
Isn‚Äôt obvious by now their hatred for Trump is infinitely greater than their love of America.
They didn‚Äôt ask trump to throw out the first pitch either. üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
Theres is one smart trump  Donald didn't produce her, Mary Trump is a kick ass smart cookie.
VOTE THE ASSHOLE OUT! trump is bragging about grabbing people. Calling protesters "anarchists".
Dr. Fauci wants Trump out of office!!! This quack doctor needs to go suck a big green donkey dick! Re-elect Trump 2020!!!
We won‚Äôt forget how many times she has supported Trump. Vote Blue No Matter Who!
Another NFL joke.
I really feel for him because he was used and abused by Trump. üòû
Voted out. November 3rd. Police. Arrest. Trump.üòè
Well Trump backed down from going to war against Iran AND North Korea.  If Trump were less distracted and less lazy he would have pulled US troops out of Syria in Afghanistan by now.
Trump did say he liked the poorly educated.., read the 1st Amendment of the Constitution.., it's unlawful to violate a person's civil right to protest.  Peaceful Protesting is not a criminal act.
Trump did say that he liked the poorly educated and that is you! hahahaha
Like Trump's mental universe extends three or four months into the future.
You talkin bout Trump?
Maybe let's not tell the super trumpies that today.   One of the basic guardrails of pluralistic society is the thought that what goes around comes around. So what President Trump does today to Antifa President Biden could do next year to anti-mask
Trump should RESIGN!
Don't think Trump will be sending his Gestapo here to Enon.  We're quit "provincial" and the only civil disturbances around here are Trump rallies.
If so I like hoodwinks. Trump‚Äôs gotta go.
Listin Barr &amp;  Trump, nothing is going to distract us from voting your president out off office. Why would you say that? Out of touch?
But um not blasting Alicia Keys every morning u fuccin trump supporter üòÇüòÇ
What in the everliving fuck are you talking about? It's literally... Objectively. Trump's America.
Since Black Lives Matter is a racist hate group, thus a racist phrase, then any player could have a KKK patch, something anti-Semitic (we know anything Anti-Trump is allowed); hell, they can have Fuck N-Word and that would be allowed, right?  #FuckBlackLivesMatter #FuckRacism
I refuse to believe this is real. Marx in the dead center? Rand (slightly) to the economic left of Warren? Not even Pinochet would be as far top right as they placed Trump
You got a lot of nerve to talk shit.,those people protesting are brave and patriotic in Trump's America with many people getting sick and dying., millions unemployed..,and a Nationalist provoking a wag the dog because he knows he's losing. hahahahaha
But it‚Äôs currently trump‚Äôs America. Sooooooo.......
It‚Äôs really kind of sad that the only commercials Trump can come up with, are designed to scare people into voting for him.
It's about damn time somebody acts for Chicagoans. The Mayor is totally incompetent in her duties. She refuses to hold anyone accountable. Trump has more backbone than these Democratic Mayors.
Liar.., this is Trump's Gestapo and you're going to jail
Liar!  This is Trump's America with his secret police attacking peaceful protesters is happening NOW!
There Rob goes again rubbing up against a more popular senator claiming bipartisanship, I call bullshit, I see your political goals. You're an embarrassed. Ohio won't forget your trump support and you can't bipartisan your way out of that one.
Abducting citizens in the dead of night.  The Gestapo did it.  The NKVD did it.  The KGB did it.  Saddam's secret police did it.  Now Trump's secret police are doing it.  I found this on Twitter. It exactly represents what's happening.
Trump doesn't crack the top 35 most racist US presidents lmao
If you don‚Äôt think they will die or get horribly sick why would you wish it on Trump supporters?   Your political views are turning you into  a terrible person. ‚úåÔ∏è
woot woot.., that is why Trump is wagging the dog in Portland!!!!
He wishes her well.  The Clinton‚Äôs wish her dead.  For the sake of all, let‚Äôs hope Trump wins this one.
It's almost a tie.., if Biden wins Texas with low numbers Trump will claim that it's rigged and will contest it and demand a recount. lololol
I can‚Äôt believe there is people out there that will go on someone‚Äôs property and steal a Trump Sign..
I think Trump sees himself as still in his 30‚Äôs-40‚Äôs.
Also, I love the assumption that people that don't believe this are sheep but the people that do are somehow woke when it's Trump who's leading you off this cliff. Hard to believe a crackpot theory from a man who has no credibility whatsoever as a human being
I was going to say they lack standing, but the cities Trump has named can make a claim.
Please don't listen to Trump..,shut it all down and don't reopen schools.
Self-enrichment is the only code  ever hadThat is quite a hurdle to be sure. But they are handicapped by just tuning into Trump's suggested news. (I am trying to remain in the spirit of John Lewis &amp; refrain from harboring any hate for them in my heart). Actually it is more akin to fear.
This has Putin and Trump written all over it, probably something they discussed in that telephone call
Heir to Estee Lauder, Ronald Lauder gave $200,000 to the Trump 2020 Campaign. Just so you know where some of your money might be going. #WeWillVote
We should reach across the isle to Trump's supporters &amp; let them in on the cruel secret joke. He doesn't care about them, just their vote. They have no money, power, prestige or connections that are useful to him. Except for their vote, they don't count, he looks down on them
Trump's gonna be needing U-hauls services soon #WeWillVote
U-haul Billionaire E. Joe Shoen donated $35,500 to Trump's Campaign in February 2020
Look at Trump's America
Our democracy is under threat by Trump #WeWillVote
My idea of what Donald Trump driving would look like
Can you imagine the road rage with Donald Trump behind the wheel of a car?
He actually supports school districts adopting policies that give parents the choice of what they think is best to protect the health and safety of their kids and others in the community. Trump, meanwhile, wants them to march in like your supporters into a Tulsa rally.
Trump 2020 you human catheter
I love it. Trump threw out the bait and the lunatic liberals fell for it hook line and sinker. They say it‚Äôs SO unsafe to go out and vote so he says he‚Äôll delay it till it‚Äôs safe and all of a sudden NO NO NO you can‚Äôt do that.
Remember 4 years ago Donald Trump was saying the election system is rigged, well 4 years later saying it again.
I bet the Senate Bill has the $50 billion for the new FBI building in Washington DC next to Trump's Hotel in it.
Trump 2020 you human catheter
Woah gamer relax
Trump is a very dangerous threat to our nation, our values, our security, this impeached Presidents powers need to be removed immediately
Trump citing a bunch of articles about issues with mail ballots in the primaries, but none were about widespread fraud. It was about quickly counting them or voters being disenfranchised by their simple errors or by the postal system.
Donald Trump shall not tamper with We The People's right to vote #WeWillVote
Trump is unhinged, his campaign is in complete chaos mode right now. Trump is scared. #WeWillVote Trump is going to lose.
Trump doesn't care about anyone
No surprise here. How many millions of Americans were dumb enough to vote for Trump?
Of course!   It was the plan all along.    All they have done for 4 years is make a big mess and stand on sidelines blaming Trump for it while he cleans it up. Same thing with Portland.  Funny thing, they think we are so stupid we don‚Äôt remember.  BUT WE DO.
How about Trump?  Never mind, we don't even need to look that up.
Donald Trump wants attention to be diverted away from him announcing today the withdrawal of US Troops from Germany, so he tweets about delaying the election which we know he can't do. #WeWillVote
There was no evidence against him.  There will be no blue win in November! TRUMP 2020!!!!!
Correction: It will get worse. We are in a depression and a pandemic, and the Trump administration is acting like a kamikaze pilot with the US.
This is a clear act of malfeasance by Trump and Pompeo, a felony and an impeachable offense.  It is not a "joke" to perversely threaten to breach the US Constitution like it is some damn game of monopoly.

Sec 1 /Art 2 of Constitution, which limits the term of the pres and VP to four years, meaning if no election, Trump and Spence are automatically out in Jan 2021.
Trr ump says he isn't  Z considering banning Tm7ikTok
Yes. Opening the schools is the wack job of idiots. My daughter is home schooled, and she will be safe. Regular schooling right now is Trump Roulette, with an automatic pistol.

American reaches 150k COVID death, jobsless claims are rising again, the economy shrunk by nearly a third through the most recently ended quarter, making this the worst recession since the Great Depression and Trump wants to keep America from voting.
It‚Äôs no coincidence that Trump would suggest we need to delay the election when it became official we‚Äôre in the recession coming off the worst economic quarter in our history and jobless claims again went up. It‚Äôs shameless.
U.S. Postal Service Gets $10 Billion Coronavirus-Relief Loan.  This is a step in the right direction.

Mark, you must be living TRUMP COVID head. Dems are the ones working to ensure everyone who is eligible gets to VOTE.  Are doing TRUMP'S bidding of smearing DEMS.
No, you are giving Putin the opportunity to begin to move in. Traitorous Trump. üò°
Brutal but every word of it true. The play on Trump's 911 ad is a brilliant twist.
I feel the same way about Fauci. But it would be political suicide for Trump. Remember people like us who actually know what‚Äôs going on unfortunately are in the minority. It‚Äôs crazy but most people in Ohio think Mr. Magoo is doing a good job. They have frightened most of us
That is insane and dangerous. It is also scary that Trump and cult want to try and silence anyone who disagrees with them. That sounds suspiciously like an action from a dictatorship &amp; oligarchy
There is no way a failure to deliver an extension and stimulus bill is anything but a political disaster for Trump and McConnell and Trump seems to be going out of his way to make sure it is.
Maybe they are expecting Trump.
trump may not have learned his lesson, but I hope the voters of Maine have.  You're a trump stooge and I can't wait for you to lose your seat.
You can tell who the SS agents are; they are the only ones wearing a mask. Maybe if they see a #CV19 droplet headed for Trump they will jump in front of it protecting him.
So you lied and Trump kicked your ass. Got it.
Funny how The Daily Show and Trump Derangement Syndrome has the same initials TDS.
Trump didn‚Äôt talk to Putin about reports of Russian bounties to the Taliban on American troops, but since his most recent call he orders 12,000 American military personnel out of Germany.
It‚Äôs kind of hard not to view Trump‚Äôs appearance in TX today as a panic move that the state is in jeopardy. They had both Rick Perry and current DOE Sec write columns praising him on oil issues to run in TX papers today to go along with it.
For those 3, the only drink is üí©Trump's favorite of bleach .
Trump is getting worse and worse He NEEDS TO GO! VOTE!!!!  HIM!!!!  OUT!!!!
I agree...and he scares the hell out of them. When he came in months ago and said Trump was spied on they KNEW their gig was up
The only difference between Trump and most Republicans since Ike is Trump doesn‚Äôt know how to avoid sayin the quiet part out loud.
Trump against the World!!  Perfect image
Mfw Trump tweets stupid shit
All three! Putin owns TRUMP.
Plus two active lawsuits. One by mom‚Äôs and the other by journalists. Trump, DHS and CBP will lose both. CBP likely to be held in contempt for disobeying Court on leaving journalists alone.
He needs to take Trump‚Äôs cognitive test, and I bet he fails it.
Besides Trump and Putin, who is saying it is false?
Trump promises made promises kept what other politicians do that most speak with a forked tongue
Smart MOVE. Republicans are going down with the TRUMP "Lolly Pop" ship.
So, you think TRUMP is representing your interest?  Why? Because he is a nice guy who cares about your problems?
You need to remove this. NYPD already explained it was the warrant division arresting someone with a warrant. After your so called hearing yesterday not allowing Barr to speak and the fact you won‚Äôt condemn riots you are handing Trump another 4 years.
He was treated terrible but as we can see with you it is typical!!  Dems sealed the deal yesterday!! Yep Trump 2020
Hey Bow Wow that means Trump is WAY ahead
Does a Trump pardon have to be public?  Could Barr already have a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù letter from Trump?
üëçThanks you hit upon my intuitive reaction. HCQ simply cannot work in this politicize atmosphere because Trump recommended it. That is definitely a big part of what‚Äôs going on
With Trump and Barr repeating that mail-in voting is unsafe/fraud, and that foreign countries will interfere, can they be planning to have the Russians flood the US mail system with false ballots in swing states?  The purpose being to keep real ballots from timely arrival?
I envy Michigan. Ohio is bombarded with  end of the world ads on a daily basis. And too close to KY so we see  even darker view of the future. #voteBlue
Trump has asked at least three countries that we know of for help in getting him re-elected. Where are the DOJ investigations?
$0 for the USPS, state or local governments. No extension of student loan debt relief. No extension of food assistance. Cuts unemployment benefits. But does spend money on more fighter jets that Trump diverted to build is wobbly wall. This is GOP‚Äôs starting offer.
Donald Trump says we have record job numbers, yeah  we have record numbers of unemployed people
Donald Trump lied about his campaign slogan, MAGA really stands for Mace And Gas America
If you ever needed an example of rigid ideology making a group oblivious to their best interest. On purely political terms, it‚Äôs McConnell and Trump that needs to quickly get a successful and robust stimulus approved now. And Pelosi gave them the opportunity back in May.
If Donald Trump could have it his way this would be our reality, I'm glad we don't have a dictatorship here.
OR....they are setting up a safety net for rigging the returns.   I personally think that‚Äôs what they are doing.   So when trump tries to stand up for us and say there is no way this is correct, they will drag this back out and say ‚Äútold you he wouldn‚Äôt leave‚Äù
A Trump second term brought to you by the Pennsylvania fracking industry and Floridaians who love low taxes.
Move the protests a block away from the federal court house. Don‚Äôt give Trump what he wants by engaging the DHS cops. The fights are what gives Trump his ability to put Fed cops in other cities. Don‚Äôt work as unpaid extras to Trump‚Äôs reality show.
We need to convince the protestors to move the protest a block away from the federal court house. The fight is exactly what Trump wants so he can send disruptive troops into other cities. If there are Trump personnel in the protestors stirring up trouble, this will show them.
Yes but as soon as lobbyists get ahold of them, they flip to swamp monster.   At least that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening for decades upon decades.  Til trump because he‚Äôs not swayed by money and power.
In today‚Äôs WH briefing achieved only two things: - Confirmed Trump‚Äôs petty jealousy of the respect Dr. Fauci receives. - He thinks demon sex/alien DNA Doctor is credible.   God, makes the WH staff and  miss the days when he advocated ingesting disinfectant.
Barr is right up there with him. And Putin is giving Trump lessons in how to topple a democracy. That's why Trump talks to him in secret with no notetaker.
I'd be willing to trade the next stimulus check for Donald Trump to hand in his resignation
Trump just tweeted that prescription cost came down from last year. That's an outright lie. At least four of my medication prizes rose significantly. One of them quadrupled since December of 2019. I have the same insurance &amp; it was exactly the same medication.
Someone please explain why you have 5pm briefings instead of 4pm. ANTI Trump  bashes the Pres and you preempt  which is pro Trump??? Stepping on your own toes.
Our economy has not adapted to the needs of parents dealing with kids in partial or full virtual enrollment with only a months notice. Columbus is too busy trying to paper over its latest scandal and Trump is.... Trump.
We shut down in March and April to flatten the curve to buy authorities time to prepare and mobilize, Trump instead largely ignored the problem. Parents waited for authorities to get command of the situation over the summer. Trump golfed instead and tried to hold rallies.
While I hope you are right, after listening to Barr today say repeatedly that both Obama and Biden illegally spied on Trump, I can‚Äôt agree. An indictment only requires a grand jury to believe there is probable cause, unlike the proof required at a trial.
Please Sarah, be careful. The Trump haters will do anything or say anything to destroy this woman because they simply cannot allow her to be correct.
Barr is going to indict both Obama and Biden before the election. Not even hiding it. Barr and Jordan said it multiple times today that Obama and Barr illegally spyed on Trump.  Charges won‚Äôt hold but could have a serious impact on the election.
Because the R‚Äôs are getting rich from being a ‚Äúpublic servants‚Äùtoo!!   I have to use quotes because they seem to only serve themselves and make decisions accordingly.   I fear this country is through after Trump üòû
Trump is dragging his left foot. A sign of having had a stroke.
The truth is....these sick fks will kill people to make trump look bad and  bully us into submissionü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I said you can stop calling yourself a progressive because you said you were voting for Trump. I agree, you‚Äôre mental disconnect is uncanny.
Why are the fed troops dressed as military? Why aren't they clearly identified? Why would you dismiss a case when defendant has pleaded guilty? Stone was pardoned for his silence, as proven by stone &amp; Trump's public statements Do you have evidence that proves otherwise?
Lawsuit alleges Trump campaign, fundraising committee shielded millions in payments - The Washington Post
The protestors need to recognize that their protesting at the Federal Court House gives Trump a gift and allows Trump to send troops to Portland. If they would protest even a block from the Federal property they would deny Trump his opportunity. Shooting themselves in their foot.
Be cool if Trump could take 10 seconds from his busy day of nonsense tweeting to join our gif thread
I didn‚Äôt know Trump was a virologist, scientist, doctor. I mean how else would psychos blame him when he was following advice from actual alleged ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.
Now  cult is whining  is suppressing  "freedom of speech"  Does that mean we can go onto Trump properties and tell everyone what idiots the Trumps are? I mean if Twitter has to follow 1A, shouldn't all businesses?
You actually  admit trump had a great economy before being wrecked by COVID? Omg.... it‚Äôs a fkng miracle ü§£ü§£HOMEWORK JOHNNY, HOMEWORK! üòÜü§≠
Trump's health care plan is due in three days, on Friday, 7/31/20. Does ANYONE actually believe Trump and the GOP have a health care plan?  It is just another Trump and GOP lie.  One of a million lies. #TrumpMillionLies
Curious how this shows a much closer race in FL than other poll. Also shows Trump leading, but within the MoE in OH.
And unfortunately the protestors are unpaid extras. Wish they would move their protest one block away from the federal court house and deny Trump what he wants.
You all are full of crap about Trump and the covd19 you DEMOCRATS are trying to kill us get out n9 9ne wants to DEMOCRATS in Trump all the way Trump 2020 stop the lies stop the bull shit

Opinion | Trump‚Äôs articles of impeachment ‚Äî updated
Russian/Trump trolls out in force tonight. I'm trying to figure out how it says they've been on twitter since 2011 but have 40 followers. Twitter stop this.
Where's Nancy Pelosi? Impeach Barr Who are those from HHS Did Trump hire the Proud Boys? Waiting until Nov3 is not an option we're under attack #WakeUpAmerica #PelosiDoYourJob  Portland etc Matt Gaetz Bounty on our troops Emoluments Clause  Its not the Lincoln Project job
Really clever chess move by GOP, massive property development to help a Trump property and funding for more fighter jets beyond the defense bill they just passed while cutting unemployment
I am in a minority but do they really have to protest at the Federal court house that houses the Fed  ‚Äúofficers?‚Äù  It is obvious Trump wants the drama. If they would protest even a block away, then the Feds have no reason to attack the protestors. If they did, arrest the Feds.
Just Trump. He is utter convinced this is what businesses want.
Nothing better than to see Trump bitching about how he is mistreated.
Bet you lunch Trump won‚Äôt show or debate. He will demand conditions that will defeat the purpose of a debate; but in reality he knows he will look like an idiot next to Biden.
So, gonna be the name of the award Trump says he was awarded but declined now?
Folks, hug your kids. Tell them you will always love them. Or else they turn out like this:
This should be a huge story!!  The left will literally kill people to make trump look bad.   It‚Äôs OBSCENE!!!!
Hey,  can we talk about how Trump was so petty he lied about throwing out the first pitch at the Yankees and then tried to make himself look like a hero by ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù it before getting busted?
With all that is going on in this country, Trump was so jealous and petty over Dr. Fauci throwing out the first pitch at the Nationals game, that Trump made up he was going to throw one out at the Yankees home opener and then ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù it.
Hey Trump this is really really fucked up.
Trump is supposed to be the President of the United States and it says a lot about him that he doesn‚Äôt feel obligated to pay his respects in his official capacity to a long serving Member of Congress and Civil Rights icon. And we just are so numb we accept it as a new normal.
New tone last slightly longer the the new MLB season. Proof Trump has actually learned nothing:
Do they realize in a mortal kombat fight Joe would probably beat Trump‚Äôs ass??
Next time you wonder how Trump voters can be so easily duped but social media misinformation, go back and see how many people on the left fell for this and thought it was real.

curious why is it always trump? For instance why not the pandemic and the failing government? because you have trump you have the dem's who seem to be losing their party to far left extremes. just on and on never seem to end
going under the bus?  Trump disown his loyal
Trump would make it about him - glad he is not going.  I wonder if the family told him through back channels not to attend.
I HAVE FUCKING REGISTERED TO VOTE! EAT SHIT TRUMP, I'M COMING TO THE POLLS WHEN THE TIME COMES!
I hear you and think there is widespread support for term limits. Trump is smart he would never try that his first term. What ya think ?
Trump didn‚Äôt win in 2016 becuase of MAGAts.    He won because of low voter turn out, especially among young people and minorities.
Finally.  get some important shit done.   Melania Trump is set to announce Rose Garden renovation, report says
Yup here‚Äôs another, Trump could cure cancer all by himself- the headlines at the Washington Post would read ‚ÄúTrump puts doctors out of work‚Äù
The only thing that may save  and the Senate GOP Class of ‚Äò22 is that voters may have moved on from Trump by then. But they have to see what‚Äôs going on and realize their capitulation to Trump has done severe political damage to their standing.
Hey, remember six months ago when the Republicans swore the Democrats would pay a steep price for impeaching Trump? Instead they‚Äôre on the cusp of losing the Senate as voters reject their rubber stamp loyalty to him.

How about more action to combat Coronavirus virus in the nation Ivanka,  No, that's what I thought, how about Police Reform and Justice Reform, No, that's what I thought.  Hey hey ho ho Donald Trump Has got to go!
- Tens of Millions unemployed  - 149,000 Americans dead from Coronavirus with more dying as you read this  - Some mom &amp; pop businesses are now gone because of Coronavirus and they will never be returning   WITH ALL OF THIS DONALD TRUMP WENT GOLFING AND THREW SOME HATS TO A CROWD
Currently:  - Putin is getting away with placing bounties on American Troops  - Coronavirus has taken over the USA  - The Trump's endorse a brand of Beans  - We have a Space Force, I guess we're are all cast members in Star Wars now  - Trump is still friends with Putin &amp; Kim
Donald Trump's Presidency and the current state of our nation, I don't even know if  could have wrote a more horrific novel
By voting trump 2020 like me a first time voter born in 1975 =45
Trump: ‚ÄúPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.‚Äù  Buckey Barns:
I'm old too, but my signature varies in my own documents so I am concerned about my vote being tossed. I have planned a protective outfit for my poll trip. Last year in my red state, I was so tempted to pull up all the Trump signs in my neighborhood. I hope I can restrain myself
Like they care about spending our tax dollars. I much rather my tax dollars go to keep folks from homelessness, instead of Trump jacking up prices for his whole posse that accompanies him to Mara Lago and paying for it with our taxes. I hope the bunch of them disappear in Nov.
And according to Trump and his doc, only 243 lbs. Most honest estimates put him over 300.
I hope they don't have these storm troopers "guarding" the poll locations. And I don't think that diversion is a strong enough description of these recurrent beatings by the trump police.
TRUMP ACES THE COGNITIVE TEST
A pair of socks could run against Trump and win,don‚Äôt take your coming win in Nov as a personal victory,people just want him gone and they don‚Äôt care who it is. It has nothing to do with you or the leader you‚Äôll pretend to be. As a country, we‚Äôre sick of rich old people in charge
I can't see We The People's House, you have got to be kidding me.   Sadly this is real.  Trump builds walls.  Yes that's right there is now a wall surrounding The White House.  Who does that?  Really the most protected house in the land needs a wall around it?  Vote Him Out
Dont forget about Trump running to the bunker because he heard peaceful protesters were outside the White House yelling #BlackLivesMatter all the while he acts like there is not a policing issue in this nation, then sends the law to attack peaceful protesters
They were always there and they were probably settle with it for the years that they felt this way and now that it's been made acceptable, from Trump and many others, they have a good now to come out and say and act like the way they wanted to the whole time
FYI:  It is a proven fact the all White House staffers are required by Donald Trump to sign Non Disclosure Agreements.  If ya didn't know now ya do, retweet pass it along.   Wanna know more just Google ' Trump non disclosure agreements '
Does Vladimir Putin have a non disclosure agreement with Donald Trump?
Anyone else think Donald Trump probably has Non Disclosure Agreements with his Wife, all his Children along with Mike Pence?
Donald Trump isn't a uniter he doesn't try to bring us closer together, he only knows how to do one thing, try to have us all at each other's throats so he can act like the nation is in such a state of violence which he can only solve when he's the one that started the violence.
Daily Reminder:  Donald J Trump is a threat to our National Security
Trump isn't running the White House, he's running a cult to destroy America and turn us all against each other.
Folks always tout Trump not accepting his 400,000 salary. While he spends 3.4 million for 3 days at Mar A Lago.
Change?? Obama was the one that wanted to transform America! Pathetic go ahead hare Trump and vote for Biden not going to work!
What are you trying to say, other than it seems you are angry at having to work with the public?  Use sentences and periods. ‚ÄúTrumps economy‚Äù was ‚Äúruined‚Äù before #CV19, it just made it worse. Had we reacted like every other country, we‚Äôd be safely opening. Trump screwed us.
This virus does appear to largely target the people that Trump considers "others".
Remember: "Everything Trump Touches Dies," as this video illustrates. And those aiding &amp; abetting him range from rotting to putrid.
I had a joke about Donald Trump but the rats in the bathroom at Mar-A-Lago ate the paper I had it wrote on.
Donald Trump will never learn that he can't silence the voice of progress
You‚Äôre the best God bless you Trump and your family.
Look at Trump's America we can't afford 4 more years
We can't afford 4 more years of Donald Trump
Yes! Help me out. I started Twitter during the impeachment.  I don't follow anyone from my hometown bc they all love Trump. I'm in Ohio. It's full of magats.ü§¢Embarassment for whom? Mr. T? The Republicans? Both I‚Äôd say. Thanx for speaking out, though it appears like rats jumping the sinking DJT ship. Political Darwinism at play: Survival is the only thing. Still, I applaud.

No we will have to worry about our life‚Äôs if that happens !!!!!  Trump 2020 our life‚Äôs depend on it !!!!!!
It's so sad to see more than one Grown Trump man act so childish
If you had done a hard shutdown, demanded and ENFORCED a mask mandate from the get go, and had not given in to the trump humpers, we wouldnt be in this position.  We are going to shut down again.   Your feckless leadership has gotten us here.
No need to answer the question. If you are unwilling to see that the only way to get to Medicare for all is by making sure trump is defeated, you're honestly too ignorant to talk to.  This is not about what you want. Joe isnt my first choice, either.  Im not a selfish asshole.
trump what‚Äôs he got to lose!!!! He is not in it for the money or fame!!!! He already has both!!!! So he‚Äôs in it for you and me and I stand with him all the way!!!
Biden is Trump 2.0
Called it last night. The "troops" were a diversion up to yesterday's testimony og Barr before Congress. The entire scope of the hearing changed due to the troop placement.  Barr's troops are last years caravan. Law and order Trump 2.0
This is the rule Trump rescinded -  The AFFH sets out a framework for local governments, States &amp; Insular Areas, and public housing agencies to take meaningful actions to overcome segregation, promote fair housing, and foster inclusive communities - free from discrimination.
This is the rule Trump just rescinded -  The AFFH sets out a framework for local governments, States &amp; Insular Areas, and public housing agencies to take meaningful actions to overcome segregation, promote fair housing, and foster inclusive communities - free from discrimination.

Then you should just vote for trump.
Even if Trump or Biden wins, remember, progressives and Socialists are taking over Congress!
Conservatives want dictatorship and for Trump to have full control of everything.
Seriously? Do you even have a clue what the law says? President Trump is acting completely within the law sending federal law enforcement to protect FEDERAL property. If you have any decency you will take this tweet down!

Democrats unfortunately would rather have people suffer than do something that would even remotely help Trump.  They prefer bad things happen in the hopes of winning elections.  It‚Äôs disgraceful #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

President Trump. I heard your Barstool interview today. It confirmed my suspicion that you do not want to be president again. The mail-in fraud hype is fake. That will be your parting excuse but in reality you want to quit.
When President Trump wins re-election all of these Riot will cease because they have lost. If they're dumb enough to continue, and they think that us rural folk are pushovers, I have two words, BRING IT! We dumb rural folk will take care of the problem!

This is really sad. Not a "ha ha, dumb ol' Trump" sad. He needs help. This is a very basic cognitive test and he barely passed. The GOP need to stop enabling this. The 25th Amendment should be invoked and he should receive treatment.

So simple couple questions. Is unemployment better or worse than 4 years ago? How about GDP? By any objective measure Trump made economy worse.
It isn‚Äôt bad enough that the nation is locked in the middle of a deadly pandemic &amp; a recession-we have to worry about WTF Trump is going to do next as well.
Well there you have it, Trump has been dropping hints for weeks that he was going to try and ¬£¬•‚Ç¨\&lt; with the election. Now he‚Äôs out in the open on Twitter with it. T‚ÄôAINT GONNA HAPPEN.
Ineptitude is Trump‚Äôs downfall. Trump took a booming economy and turned it into a recession. And had no plan other than semi stopping flights from China.
I'm sure I'm late to the dance on this one, but I wonder what Senators had stock in Kodak and how many bought a bunch more in the last month?  Why would he use the defense act to help out Kodak?  Makes no sense.  Trump must have made a fortune on this somehow.
What polite?! Their coverage of Trump is 95% negative. Please.
Trump‚Äôs relentless attack on the USPS is not without a more sinister purpose. The upcoming election is going to rely heavily on mail-in voting-so people can vote without getting sick. Trump would love to sabotage that. He cares NOTHING about you or I.
When did trump stop travel to and from the source of the virus? About a month before pelosi gave her china town speech.  Why can‚Äôt you just accept facts? Trump derangement kills
Trump does
I'm not sure this congressman can use the key fob for his Escalade let alone discern the difference between any social media app. As far as the topic of censorship I don't recall him asking Trump to calm his tone on banning apps or news organizations that aren't favorable to him.
Everything Trump touches dies.
curious.....what WOULD they do if Trump got the virus to the same degree Boris Johnson got the virus?  Seriously
on top of the bad economic news this morning .....no wonder Trump is trying to delay the election.  I say we move it up to next tuesday
told ya...I knew they would find some other reason why he died.  it  wasnt because he didnt wear a mask indoors at a super spreader event because then it would be on Trump

What  All I'm saying is anything but Trump. I'd take one of those feces eating beetles. But if we split the (semi) left vote, trump could win
I believe that Trump has to go.  Maybe then we can start over. But first Trump has to go.
Trump could win. I'd vote for a squishy potato before him.
I still believe in Jim Jordan for now other Republicans have let us all down but for right now, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt,  Jordan is the least of our problems and I believes Trump trust him .
We've got worst stuff to take care of first. Trump has to go. Then we may be able to try to be the country that we want to be.
Look you guys,  no one believes the democrats are great. But if you don't vote or vote for a third party,  you might not have a country. No vote. No voice. Trump could win.  Do you really want that? I have 2 kids and 4 grandkids and I don't want that for them!!!

I can do the same about Trump so what
America still hasnt come to grips with the fact that Trump will say whatever he wants to say without regard to fact or validity.  As long as it gets out there, he knows it will have a life and his followers will devour it in its entirety and thats all he cares about

The worst part is he is still president until inauguration day. He along with the extremist right will destroy the country on their way out. They have time. Also, I have been saying for years, Trump will find a way to use martial law to stay and he found that way.

I've been blessed. I have a great life! The problem is too many people in this country don't but that is changing finally! By the way you can be a Christian or a Trump supporter but you can't be both enjoy the rest of your hypocritical life

Yeah if I'm irrational because I care more about the racial injustice in this country than statues and momuments than I can live with that and so can my God. You call yourself a Christian wow!!
And you continue to admire that to happen. And no, the admin doesn't, the Intel agencies that you and trump think are against you. You use them for your gain when it suffices you. Then they are good.

Also i love the fact that when I search for a gif using the world loser it brings up Trump
My theory is that the oligarchy/"deep state" REQUIRED candidates for power positions, to visit Pedo Island and perform on tape, so the 'real' rulers could control those they put in public roles. The hostility to Trump, is bc "they" HAVE NO TAPE ON HIM, making him a threat.
I made the mistake of tuning in to MSNBC, and the liberals joining in with Trump with the pearl clutching and fear mongering about "anarchists" as if we're some kind of bogeyman is fucking nauseating.

The Trump administration, throwing supporters under the bus. Again.  Really, this should be recognized as the default outcome, not the isolated one.Come on maaaan!, u think the American people are stupid!, prez trump has been a buncked up prez all this time &amp; has done a terrible job as a so called president &amp; his response with COVID-19, if there was a drug the doc‚Äôs would‚Äôve said so, stop lyingü§Æ

Hundreds of thousands of women mobilized. If Trump plays games with voting, 50,000 people will surround the WH on 11/5. If he likes s a does not leave on January 20, 15 million people will surround the city. He will leave by helicopter, an exile. This is America. 2/2.
I can‚Äôt think of a single person who could die of Covid who would convince someone who doesn‚Äôt believe the science to change their mind. Trump could drown on a ventilator and people would tie themselves in knots to not change habits. Everything is useless, no one will learn.
Amen!  Next year is going to be a year worth celebrating!  Dump tRump.
Despite Trump‚Äôs 2nd tweet,  no law says that Fox New annoints a President by midnight. If it takes weeks, it takes weeks..historically, it did. Obviously, get your ballot and return it ASAP. But remember January 21, 2009. 1/2
What a disgusting human being! Using a person‚Äôs eulogy to push a political agenda. I am so glad he is no longer President. We have definitely traded up with Trump.
I waste very little energy discussing Trump on my podcast. That‚Äôs what Twitter is for right?
Another Trump crook.
reversed his decision to block hydroxychloroquine prescriptions for treatment of COVID-19 in Ohio. Many Ohioans will ultimately die as a result of this deliberate abandonment of sound science and medicine and reckless, bizarre fealty to Trump. #ohiocoronavirus
Years from now when the full truth emerges we will learn that the Trump show was 10 times worse than we can ever have imagined.
This scares the crap out of me ..Trump will do anything to get reelected.

Voting again for President Trump from Cincinnati Ohio USA.
I feel like committing suicide.  Our country is in turmoil losing ground on many fronts.  Cincinnati is dead everywhere again.  Trump supporters are being very mean and vicious because I shared I would vote Biden.  I have no friends now.  All of this is taking a huge toll on me.
Absolutely absurd. He's a terrible man and one of the worst possible influences on trump's natsec policy
The justification is that an inexpensive, safe, readily available, and effective treatment for covid-19 could rapidly mitigate the effects of the pandemic, boosting the economy, fueling public optimism, and reelecting Trump. That's it.
Feeling suicidal.  Being pushed away and hated for sharing Joe Biden could win the election.  I have no friends.  I spend family money to keep up my lifestyle since I have no friends.  Trump supporters calling me every name and questioning if I ever had any intelligence.
No quite unlike President Trump. Obama hates America. Wants it transformed to socialism.  Look how much money good ole barrack has made . Trump doesn't need the money. And Trump does what he says he's going to do. First Pres ever to do that.

I feel bad for Cain. He ended up dying for Trump.
He was in remission in 2007, in complete remission for the requisite 5 years by 2012. He died, after a month of suffering, from COVID-19. You don‚Äôt have to look for comorbidity just because it makes Donald Trump look less tesponsible.

Imagine literally risking your life to go to a Trump rally and then actually dying because of it. I feel guilty and exposed by going to get my mail. #DyingForTrump
Deny...deny...deny all you want, but the man got Covid-19 at the trump rally! The timing adds up perfectly! 8 members of trump's staff tested positive. Cain refused to take precautions.

Hillary Clinton said to accept Donald Trump with an open mind.   Should Joe Biden win the election I will have an open mind.  Does not make me a con artist to exercise my right to vote.  Civic engagement matters more than ever.  America is on the wrong course.
The Dems let a raging monster into the house, now they're blaming Trump because it's shitting everywhere.
You either forget, or are clueless to how the Dems called Trump a racist for months for wanting to close the borders to prevent it from spreading. Dems did everything they could to prevent it. Then they spread the false narrative that Trump didn't act fast enough. You believe it
If there‚Äôs an attempt to delay or circumvent my constitutional right to a free and fair election, I will take up arms against the current Trump administration and forcefully remove them, as is my right as a free American citizen. I will lead a mighty uprising.

The election is delayed for Trump voters only. Pass it on. November 4 if you‚Äôre a Trump voter.
Died because of a rally organized by that same president, no less. Trump's campaign forced people to sign waivers because they knew some would almost assuredly get covid there and die. They didn't require masks and removed social distancing notices
NFL, NASCAR, MLS, MLB and now the NBA all kneeling during the national anthem or otherwise speaking out against racism. If they let college players do that, pretty much all the sports Trump voters will be able to watch are competitive bible studies.

Yep. August/September are going to be an important months for the GOP who have seats up for grabs. Some of them going to need to decide whether to break away from Trump publicly to save themselves.

Trump voters in 2016 had an average income of $72,000 a year.   His base is not the hillbillies the media finds and talks to, it‚Äôs the lawyers, doctors, managers, etc.   Like that couple on their front yards pointing guns at protestors.
Herman Cain is in that, um, demographic, if you will, of people that Trump really couldn't give less of a crap about if he were moved to try.  It's a category called "people who are not Donald Trump".

And just to clear some things up, the "silent majority," voted for Hillary,  the Electoral college put Trump in the White House.
Thank you for your service!  Where did Trump pumps get this asinine idea that all "liberals" want destruction,  anarchy,  violence?  I'm an Independent,  voted for both parties in the past.  I cannot watch the daily shit show with Trump.   He's a danger to our democracy.
President Donald Trump met Thursday with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a ‚Äúterrible story‚Äù and that he would help with funeral expenses.

If you have studied history in depth, you will understand what I am getting at. Considering the current economic and political situation due to the Pandemic,  what do you think it would have looked like if Trump had waited and ran his first campaign for 2020?

That‚Äôs when they crawled out. They‚Äôre emboldened. And Trump is stoking the fires for civil war.
most republican politicians today have said they're opposed to delaying the election, and if trump pulls this shit Oct 30 they'll have the added incentive of knowing they'll lose reelection if Trump's base actually stays home, so it'll be within their own interests for (1)

It's not secret information, but trump doesn't want you to know or it ruins his narrative.
main problem I see with this plan is that Trump's voters are really enthusiastic to vote for him and I don't see a possibility where they just decide not to show up to the polls

There is a difference between not being perfect and the MANY terrible things for which Trump is accused. And the incompetence that led to the loss of 150k lives in just SIX MONTHS. Any good he has done is completely out weighted by his failures.
Exactly. Trump was too busu bullying his sycophants into supporting his arrogant ignorance regarding a very real and serious public health emergency.

There's a hitch in his voice when he is about to deliver the line that will be seen as an attack on Trump.   Maybe it's just me but I like it. It makes me believe that his heart isn't behind the attack. That it's not who he is, just who he needs to be in the moment.
If Trump seriously wanted the reopening of schools, he would have taken the coronavirus  very seriously, instead of whining and calling it hoax. He finally waved the White flag and surrendered to COVID-19 and now want our children to return to school with no safety guidelines

The election cannot legally be delayed. Even Trump, as stupid as he is, must know this. His stupid comments are meant to confuse people, hoping some will stay home.
I am not sure what else Trump has to do to conclusively prove that he is totally incapable of leading this great country.
Not for this corrupt dolt. Not while I'm still breathing and can do anything about it! Look, if it's close (not the scenario anticipated) we could have another Bush v. Gore and SCOTUS could side with Trump. But that's not the same as SCOTUS ruling for Biden and military mutinying
Have you ever seen a Republican group , let alone three, campaign against one of their own so hard like they have Trump? Lincoln Project Midas media Etc.?
So glad we have Trump and Melania in the White House, and not that one dude Barry and his husband Michael.

Trump Tweeted on this day to deflect the absolute and total failure of Covid-19 control resulting in the economy tanking 33% (GDP) and another 1.4 million more unemployed in the last week. The proverbial shinny object.
Sounds good we will go vote in person and kick Donald Trump's ass out of the White House
Of course they will. First, the Generals and Admirals don't seem to like Trump at all. But second, any one of them not following the orders of the new POTUS would be guilty of sedition or mutiny; would be Court-Martialed by those following law and Constitution. Just not worth it.
Doesn't matter who gets the most votes, its about who wins the electoral college, been that way wayyyyy before Trump. Why even talk about "most votes" when it doesn't matter at all who wins the Presidency. It's totally irrelevant.
I thought GWBush would take the title of the worst modern President there for a hot minute. But nope. Trump is best at something; being the worst.
....unless Trump decides otherwise.
.... you‚Äôre  likely correct: Trump was making noise today to deflect attention from the economic disaster portrayed by today‚Äôs GDP release. But if he does decide to cancel the election you know  will fall in line.
Wrong
America has already vanished in less than four years since Trump became President.  150k Americans are dead under his watch and the worst economic downturn in the history of America. The richest and technologically advanced country in the world we are unable to contain COVID-19.

A Precedent on the books that Democrats were trying to have removed before the Impeachment trial of President Trump Had Began! In '74, as Nixon faced impeachment, the Republican Congress Passed a law that would allow his term to be extended if he was acquitted as "Trump Has Been"
If the statement begins with why "Trump is *medically* correct" (emphasis added) my statement stands without reservation. Last I was aware the POTUS is also not either a medical professional or epidemiologist, nor seems to actively listen to such qualified individuals.

Trump killed him. He is a great friend.
Hearing Pres.  speak at Rep. Lewis' eulogy was great in two ways. 1) another amazing speech from a master orator 2)  is feeling inadequate now because Pres. Obama means everything to our nation and we have a regard for him that Trump is dying to have.
I'm pretty sure that the majority of Republicans in Washington want Trump gone as well...they just don't have the stones to say so publicly. This Republican definitely wants him gone.
Pelosi responds to Trump floating election delay by quoting from Constitution    "'President Pelosi' trended on Twitter, with users noting that even if an election is delayed, Trump's term in office would be up in January, making Pelosi the next in line."
The media also lied about Trump not saying words of honor yo him. Trump know he was guilty of crimes and he still said what he did. The tactics of these murderous liars.
If Trump can say what plasma is using at least 5 words with more than two syllables, I‚Äôll donate $1,000 to his campaign.

Same here. It disgust me to see the lack of human decency from the left. Many conservatives were respectful with the death of John Lewis but the shit all over Herman Cain because he was at a Trump rally. I'm so sick of this shit

First of all the GDP only fell by an expected 9% for the quarter the 32% is annualized. Second he just raising the point that mass mail in ballots would be a disaster. And the left thinks everyone will die if we go to the polls in person. If doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative blame TRUMP!

We have one !President  Donald J. TRUMP!!
I‚Äôve never seen a president ‚Äújoke‚Äù as much as Trump seemingly does...
Excerpt regarding Ohio postponing its Primary in March  Asked about the possibility of postponing elections, Trump told reporters he thought such measures were "unnecessary."  "I'd leave that up to the states, that's a big deal postponing an election," he said.
Even in this opinion by Alan Dershowitz ( from Trump's impeachment team, btw) he goes on to say   "However, if there were no election, there may be a Democratic majority among the remaining senators not up for reelection." and suggests Leahy or even Warren or Sanders could be it.
So your fine with it?? Trump is actively trying to subvert the election between spreading misinformation, fraud, lies, suppressing the vote, and OPENLY PLANNED VOTER INTIMIDATION... The GOP is hiring 50k goons to intimidate POC who try to vote in swing states....

Someone needs to start a Twitter for Trump like the blog Toby created for Creed in The Office.
Trump thought it was perfectly safe for people to vote in the primaries, but now he's calling for the general election to be delayed.  Fortunately, he doesn't have the power to move the date, and there's a less than 0% chance of Congress changing the date.
My prediction is that if Donald Trump loses the election - no matter how badly - he will not accept the result as legitimate. I recently re-read Al Gore's 2000 concession and I can't imagine Donald Trump ever saying anything remotely close to it. - Mike

President Donald Trump's view of flawed election is baseless:   Trump floats a "delay" to November's presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud:
Covid is real, but there is most definitely something bigger at play here.  The world is run by people you don't see.  So, when people say, "You think the whole world is in on this?"  It's definitely a possibility.  How else could someone like Trump remain president? #COVID19

yessir. trump bought millions of doses, is using his propaganda machine to claim it works when the fda says it doesn‚Äôt and is pumping up this snake oil to sell to folks that won‚Äôt wear masks just so they can make a profit on their inventory.
Trump just conceded the election with a one tweet, so he has nothing else to do today.
No only Both houses of Congress have the authority via the Constitution to delay the election. It is never been done in our history. Not during civil War, 1914 Flu epidemic, WW 1 &amp; 2. Trump loses = Trump in Prison. He's leaving nothing to chance. #ItsTheFascistWay
Is that why Donald trump was buddy buddy with Epstein?
At this point I would be embarrassed to be a trump supporter
What would you want them to say?  Herman Cain actively undermined proven precautions that slow the spread of COVID.  In essence this Trump over country attitude he perpetrated killed him.  Very sad
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump tweets this as we say our goodbyes today to #JohnLewisGoodTrouble because today isn‚Äôt about him . #NobodyLikesTrump
Trump publicly talks about delaying the election.   Herman Cain has died of Covid after going to the Tulsa rally.  Latry Householder has been indicted and removed as speaker of the Ohio House.  The economy bottomed out.  It‚Äôs not even noon on a Thursday.
Trump wants kids to go back to school despite the virus but then suggest to report the election cause of corona. Polls aren‚Äôt looking great for him I guess
So, does Trump attend Herman Cain‚Äôs funeral? It would be his first funeral of a COVID-19 victim.
Trump is a murderer!
So, Trump filled his administration with left wingers? Can‚Äôt pick wives, can‚Äôt pick staff, can‚Äôt pick whores. What IS he good at?
COVID is so woke. Spreads like wildfire at Trump rallies but stays idle at BLM protests. Easily top 3 or 4 most woke viruses of all time.
Trump only wants to delay the election cause now he won‚Äôt get that extra $600 once he‚Äôs unemployed
Trump shouldn‚Äôt have said it himself (it should come from Congress, but let‚Äôs be honest here.. an entirely mail-in ballot election would be a complete shit show and should NOT happen.
Even if this date is cherry picked, just look at the graphs. Trump's highest point isn't as high as Biden's lowest. Whereas he was often leading, tied, or within a couple of points of Clinton.
you're gettin' fleeced hard for those. clearly trump has the better plug
You don‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù with a pandemic.   If you try, the pandemic wins.   Ignore Trump and Gohmert and Nino Vitale. They‚Äôre nuts, and they don‚Äôt care if others die because of it.   This is life and death.   Stay safe.
Damn didn‚Äôt know you were attracted to trump üòÇ
Hard to disagree here. Purposely took off the social distancing stickers from the seats, and disregarded the mask mandate. Now a member of his administration is dead. All for Trump to embarrass himself on a national stage.
Headline should include ‚Äúafter contracting COVID at Trump rally,  while not wearing a mask, and where Trump campaign removed social distancing markers blocking seats.‚Äù While tragic, connections need to be made so people will heed the advice of experts. #WearADamnMask
Call me crazy but I still think trump is less of a dirt bag than those two

Killed by Trump
This is so upsetting. Had Herman Cain not attended the Trump rally, he‚Äôd still be alive right now. Please take COVID seriously, people.
Herman Cain literally died for Trump.
Damn, Trump is dangerously stupid.
Clearly someone reminded him that Trump would be displeased. The governor quaked in his "boots" and chided the pharmacy board.  #Shame
Herman Cain attended the Tulsa Trump rally and was hospitalized soon after. May he rest in peace.
Didn't trump say it's ok to accept out side help ? Didn't he also say the president has absolute power and can do whatever he wants? I know I'm asking but we both know the answer and it's yes .
RIP Mr. Cain. ‚ÄúOn July 2, he was hospitalized in an Atlanta-area hospital, two weeks after attending President Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa.‚Äù
Right. If Trump senses any possibility he'll jump on it.
This is sad. Of course, we don‚Äôt know exactly how he contracted this virus but we do know that he attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally just weeks before being hospitalized.   Americans need to be smart about this virus. Please please please do not put yourself in high-risk situations.
AG Barr, who has lied to the American people on multiple occasions is investigating multiple things to benefit trump. And when he doesn't get the answer he wants, he'll have the investigators investigated and have it restarted by someone else. This doesn't help.
Maybe his death will wake some of these ‚Äúanti maskers‚Äù up!  His family should sue the trump organization but didn‚Äôt they all sign waivers?  It is yet another unnecessary death!!
This is exact reason Trump was elected people got sick of PC and the dog and pony show it may not be right but this is what happened in 2016
The economy is taking a nosedive, Trump‚Äôs threatening to postpone the election, and Trump  killed Herman Cain. And it‚Äôs not even noon.
And here's a recent piece  and I co-authored about the incredible progress the Trump Administration has made with support for HBCUs. RIP Herman:
Donald Trump: "Let's delay the election until people can do so safely and securely."  Also Donald Trump: "Let's hold a rally in an arena and completely discourage social distancing!"
It‚Äôs a diversion.  Trump is trying to draw attention away from the worst GDP report ever. He can‚Äôt do shit to delay the election.  Do not fall for this.ÔøºÔøºÔøºÔøº  #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Let me help you with that headline, After attending a Trump rally without masks in Tulsa
More than likely, contracted it at one of Trump's Klan rallies. RIP, üôè
In order to preserve their political narrative, the Trump campaign is willing to risk people dying.   And they are.
‚ÄúGO OUT AND VOTE‚Äù liberals scream as Trump cancels mail in voting during a pandemic and proceeds to crown himself as Emperor of the United States.
That sounds like wishful thinking with a narcissist like Donnie. Also, if they don‚Äôt represent Trump, what does the party even stand for anymore?
My second response was, well, I guess Trump lost his Black vote
Here he is at the Tulsa Trump rally.
Soooo what are Trump‚Äôs supporters excuse for this one? The dude refused to wear a face mask at the rally in Tulsa. But hey, I‚Äôm sure this is only the flu, right?
I cannot say I feel sorry for Herman Cain. He assisted with projecting Covid19 as a hoax and smiled and took selfies at the Tulsa Trump Rally and decried wearing a mask to protect himself and others...On the other hand, I hope his soul rests well and that he didn't die in vain

She‚Äôs not the president. I‚Äôll Trump you with Trumps own dumb shot . In the middle of a pandemic, cases and deaths growing more and more plus  more than enough evidence that this is a real problem our great leader had a rally  in Oklahoma. Believe the governor got sick after.üòÇ

Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!  ‚Äî Herman Cain ( July 1, 2020
Trump‚Äôs record on this matter isn‚Äôt pristine, but he‚Äôs the first president in a long, long time that hasn‚Äôt *started* a new conflict, and that‚Äôs saying something.
Maybe, but in the Presidential election (or is it a selection?) between Trump vs Biden, imo we the people really have a choice between poison a or poison b. So delaying the election does not matter all that much, but it gives the media something to talk about, as Trump knows.
I donated $9.99 to his campaign. First time ever donating to a campaign (and last until Trump). So sad, I'm glad he was able to do the great Uncle Tom documentary
Herman Cain is a victim of Donald Trump's egotism and refusal to act on Coronavirus in a timely and prepared manner.
Send his ass back to Trump Tower in November. What's left of his following can join him.
Ladies and gentlemen, the real reason for all of this bullshit;  US President Donald Trump has suggested a delay to the 2020 election, citing possible mail-in voting fraud despite little evidence.
Trump sucks but Obama absolutely didn't deserve the Peace Prize. He's a war criminal who oversaw the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the Middle East and increased drone strikes. 8 different countries were bombed by his administration
The Republican Party is no longer separable from Donald trump and whatever fresh fascist hell he creates each day  EVERY Republican in office is now equally responsible for his transgressions
Please look in the mirror. Your disgust for Trump has caused you to jump on every negative thing about Trump and believe it! You do NOT report fairly and I have called you out on it before! You. Are. Very. Biased!

The funny thing is Trump knows he‚Äôs the thing that is the great embarrassment to the USA.
trump can't move or cancel the election ignore that man
Based on the court upholding Obama‚Äôs DACA EO, Trump can delay the election with an EO?
My hope: In 5 years, defending Trump's legacy will be tantamount to defending Hitler's legacy. It will still be done, but quietly, in private, by a tiny number of truly disturbed individuals.  We might not get there in 5 years, but I'd very much like to see us on that trajectory.
He got it at a Trump rally
"Trailing badly in the polls, the president baselessly suggested the Nov election would be 'the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT' in history."  'Sen McConnell of KY did not answer questions about Trump‚Äôs tweet as he walked onto the Senate floor Thurs morning.'
Trump's tweet was nothing more than a distraction from his disastrous economy.
So much is at stake in Hamilton County beyond bouncing Donald Trump out of the white house. We got Republicans trying to slip under the radar as Democrats because they know its a wrap in Hamilton County. No Trumplites allowed! No thank you.
What about the Trump clothing lines?  Wouldn't they bring jobs to the USA?
You absolutely know that Trump's broken, brittle, and bitter mind has thought "Well, I could start a war. A big beautiful war. That would surely be an emergency worth delaying the election for."
I find it rediculous that anyone is saying this. I submit taking some time to read Biden‚Äôs position papers to understand what he wants to do when elected. I don‚Äôt believe this is a ‚Äúanyone but Trump‚Äù election. I truly believe Biden is the best choice
Trump makes Pharmaceutical Drugs cheaper and now Ohio wants to ban the cheapest drug that might help in early signs of COVID-19. Flu has vaccine but people still get the Flu.

Trump suggesting to delay the 2020 election because of 'mail in voter fraud' is just the next logic step in the authoritarian playbook. Sew distrust in the vote and never admit defeat
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - BBC News                         He says the scary part out loud.  But the constitution is clear: if no election results by January he still has to leave - and then we‚Äôd have President Pelosi.
That's B's Trump had an office for this and disbanded it. He fired Dr who told him we weren't prepared for this and continually gives mis information, conspiracy theories and lies. Criminally negelegent homicide! Murderers all. So stupid they won't wear mask get sick and wonder!
Trump‚Äôs tweet protecting the ‚ÄúSuburban Lifestyle Dream‚Äù is racist but so are zoning laws that prevent additional affordable housing to be created in white suburbia. Plenty of the top party officials decrying the tweet are guilty of the same effect, even if it‚Äôs quieter
We can‚Äôt sleep until Biden is sworn in January 2021.  Never underestimate trump‚Äôs criminality.

Trump tries to change the subject. Only Congress can delay elections. Give us Vote by Mail, and let us pass judgment on your failed presidency. It's a mercy killing, at this point.
The responses you are getting to this question are scaring me. This question should be posed as Who in their right mind likes trump?
Why don't we see more outrage over abuses like this? Or are abuses of power only bad when Trump is responsible?
Trump raises possibility of delaying US presidential elections over possible 'fraudulent voting'  via
Scenario 1 puts it in the hands of Congress, which would give Trump a legitimate election victory anyway.  A worse scenario would be a 2000 Florida repeat, except DeSantis refuses to appoint electors for Biden, and Congress gives the victory to Trump.
I think it‚Äôs almost a certainty at this point that Trump will not accept the results of the election if he loses. Let‚Äôs just hope there are people around him willing to do the right thing.

After having Trump for president the motto should be don't trust Trump's Gop.

1st. It matters that it was 2017? Trump helped these knuckle draggers feel comfy to leave of their meth labs. 2nd. Whitmer and state legislators were threatened with violence. Imagine your lefties showing up armed to the teeth on the steps of a govt building. 3rd. Yeah I agree.
We all know it‚Äôs a Democrat trick to rig the election.  Just like we all knew the impeachment was a scam to get Trump removed.  Democrats only care about one thing... getting thier money scams up and running again... that‚Äôs it.!
I remember when Trump said California should rake forest floors to prevent wildfires.
I will probably get shit for this. Even though i may not agree with his message, at least dude could articulate eloquently. Trump sounds like he is reading from something he cant actually read lol #mericasfucked

So...you didn't read it.  Meanwhile, Trump's cronies &amp; extended families rake in the $.
The states that take the longest to count are red states!  Places like Ky, Ariz, and the like take a long time. They never have had results the same day or even the next.  Trump is trying to create a new history and then play up Dems as breaching it.
To divide the country even further, to promote hate, to promote fear, to keep people from living, to keep them dependent on the government handouts, to incite fear and violence, just to make it look like it‚Äôs trumps fault. We see through it, and will show it in November.üëäüèºüá∫üá∏TRUMP

Trump is sort of a special case, no?  got a pardon, Reagan got a pass because he was senile and GHWB pardoned everyone connected to Iran-Contra, Bush got a pass because he'd been more or less euchred into war. Trump isn't leaving D.C. with any friends in power.

The elections are run through the State,  has already stated she‚Äôs been in contact with States. What States need to do is have drop off sites where you get a receipt. With what Trump has done the Democrats  will be on high alert. We have to overcome!
That‚Äôs the official government line from Trump‚Äôs Ministry of Propaganda. I think it should be called the Trump Virus because as president, he‚Äôs responsible for things like public health catastrophes.
Imagine how things could have been so different if we'd had a president who wasn't a narcissist and a GOP that weren't cowards.  The greatest fiasco in history perpetrated by Trump and the Republican Party.

No, I'm a realist. My choice is between an incompetent narcissist and budding fascist in Trump or a competent, compassionate and empathetic person who respects Democracy and the rule of law in Biden. I'll chose the second person every time and so will the majority of Americans.
I hearted this tweet because I think the President has the work of the People to do. However, I also want to know the Truth of the Question I ask. "Will You Pardon Trump or Not?" We deserve to know your answer.
"investing"? trump so dearly loves his poorly educated minions.
He doesn't need to win the House. Each state delegation gets one vote. Trump wins if it goes to the House.
Why worry? House Republicans let Trump use their seats since stealing election.
1) the money sent to Iran was their money that had been frozen due to US sanctions, not US money given to Iran 2) allowing continued abuse of students is not a minor offense. He should be charged with abetting 3) Trump declared bankruptcy 6 TIMES!!!
I can tolerate Trump's personal flaws in the greater struggle for the Soul of America. He is a crude man, but his policies have been on point... and the alternative America the Left presents, and how they plan to bring it to fruition, should give every American nightmares.
You think I could wear a trump hat there without getting threatened or mauled?
My concern is not getting to a vaccine. HOW ARE WE GOING TO ROLL OUT THE VACCINE TO EVERYONE?!?!? Sorry to yell but this is my concern. We can't get testing. How can the trump administration get everyone vaccinated? They cannot.  Vote Joe. He can roll it out effectively.
Question of the Day: Do I answer the "official" trump approval poll? And if so...do I troll it? Or tell them what I really think?
Is Trump British now? Plawsma???
I‚Äôm not trying to call you out or anything but I think it could be productive to notice that the only difference we‚Äôve rooted out so far is that Trump is uglier. Which is kinda strange. Is it possible that they were both terrible presidents, maybe fascists?
Trump is a nation security risk. Period.    Trump‚Äôs ridiculous phone call with a Republican senator was recorded ‚Äî and given to The New York Times ‚Äì Raw Story
Of course he can!  Didn't you hear Trump believes in free speech...
Trump is just about out of options. He can't win an honest  election. Putin can't win it for him this time. Making war with US citizens didn't work for him. He blundered the virus.  Millions are unemployed. His only hope is a plea bargain that allows him to flee America forever.
With all due respect to ALL human life, if it ends up killing elderly Trump &amp; perhaps some other feckless elderly GOP naysayers/down-players, it WILL be reassuring towards starting a "new tone" in response &amp; probably saving many others. {As well as reassuring politically}.
Well, Biden will take office and Trump can run around the country looking for a "court" that will let him cheat.  Good luck with that...
Let's talk about Trump's call to suspend the elections....  via  Plain Talk, Truth, must Listen.
Thanks to trump,  those who think for themselves realized how bad it can get and a fresh reminder of not taking things for granted and cherishing the great times. A nice gut check on how ugly people can be as well.
Yes! As you know, vote-by-mail has worked just fine in OR for over 20 years. Trackable all the way. Where's the press pushback on Trump's lies?
And to be fair, there are Republicans that have not converted to Trumpublicans. Trumpublicans belong to the Cult of Trump.
It shows Trump‚Äôs total lack of character.
Duh. Ah, Trump will be reelected because the DNC failed to run an acceptable candidate. If I have to chose between two rapist to save my country, I have a country not WORTH SAVING. VOTING GREEN.
Years ago I would‚Äôve guessed Bobcat Goldthwaite. Now it is anyone with the last name Trump.
Trump wanted to stop testing because he thought Coronavirus would "disappear like a miracle." Kushner cancelled plans for testing and tracing because he hoped that if enough people in blue states died it would help Trump's re-election odds.
There must be dozens of rich and powerful men and women desperately trying to find a way to prevent her case from proceeding and to insure evidence never becomes public. Trump is in the same danger. I am amazed each day that they are still around.
Name 5 drugs that Trump has been personally responsible for a decease in price in the last 3.5 years. Crickets?? You can't get important work done from the golf course, Donald.
"A lot of very tough people"  Sure, bro.  Trump needs to be removed from office. He's a traitor and a menace.

BREAKING CRISIS: Trump Suggests Delaying 2020 Election  via
Idk, the media is one of the main reasons Trump got elected, y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt shut the fuck up about him and actually inform the public on policy. So like, maybe get over it? I dunno, this is just a hot take
Herman Cain was a grown man and he made his own decisions. Trump's example may have swayed his decision making but Cain is ultimately responsible for his decision to attend the rally and not protect himself.
Trump is a better black president that POS hussein. fact.
He got what he wanted out of trump, now he‚Äôs casting him aside
#BREAKING Donald Trump is not the Emperor of NATO.
Trump cannot delay the election, but he can get his cult to believe the election if fixed or fraudulent. There is no doubt that he is willing to wage war with the citizens to remain in power.
If you ask the google "who is the highest ranking Trump administration official to die of COVID-19?", the Google never mentions Secretary Herman Cain why?    Who is hiding what?   #shakeandbakeCT
I guess he felt he had to say something. Cain‚Äôs death was directly tRump‚Äôs fault.
Hahah wrong story. It was Eric Trump stealing money from cancer patients during golf tournaments. This is a separate story all together
‚ÄúFor Trump?‚Äù That‚Äôs a stupid remark. How about The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended they go to school.
So even though 10 miles is such a small number. You had to make it an even smaller number(few) and a smaller unit of measurement(inches). If its so pathetic and insignificant, you wouldn't have to lie. Prepare for 208 more weeks of Trump.
Without Moscow Mitch and Barr to shield him from investigation and prosecution, Trump is just another felon awaiting sentencing for a multitude of crimes.
Mm, George ? Trump has no bottom. He can sink further then we would like to believe.
Trump is too chicken to confront Putin about Russian bounties on the heads of American soldiers. #TrumpRussia
Why yes indeed! I am so overwrought and need to go take a Xanax!If Trump supported vote by mail, you would not want it.
Flynn was fired 3wks into new Trump administration &amp; info now declassified was NOT known then......Trump &amp; Pence have already stated they would hired Flynn back  Have you read the recently declassified documents......horrible what was done to Flynn
Trump 2020!  I believe in America and patriotism. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism takeover of America.  If you don‚Äôt like your country, you can always move to China.  The people who are complaining about Trump said they would move out?  I‚Äôm Still waiting
Not a bad person? Depends‚Ä¶ Look at the jackass for the San Francisco Giants who used the weak ass excuse of being a Christian (like most everyone else kneeling wasn‚Äôt a Christian) when the reality was he was a Trump supporter who has badmouthed the BLM movement....POSü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden should drop out and endorse President Trump.  Now is not the time for petty partisan election politics.
Apprehension is not kidnapping. Damaging property that‚Äôs federal property is a federal offense, that‚Äôs a crime. Happy to see federal officers in Oregon thank God for Trump.  Besides the mayor and governor are useless.
F***head Trump brings up COVID-19 rising in Oregon--only when our Governor leaped on Pres. F***head's re-opening BS!  His asshole supporters exploded out into public places w/t masks. But biggest spread was in factories packaging food products. As Trump demanded states do.
Lara &amp; Erik Trump donated $20 million to help children with cancer in 2016. Of course, the big news networks never reported that.
I think it‚Äôs hilarious that Trump supporters make fun of Biden for being old and delusional like... y‚Äôall do realize the irony right?
Free boat, was my late grandfather‚Äôs, the trump check bought the trailer though lol
#IMPOTUS lies. OR &amp; other states have done mail-in voting for years with no problems. But Trump is trying to screw the USPS &amp; the election.
Lol. With Trump's habit of lying every time he speaks does it matter? 20,000 + lies since elected.
Almost nothing that comes from Trump's administration can be believed, so there is no way for me to accept all the propaganda that they provide. Is it true or not? We don't know. I find most stories just too hard to believe.
THERE is NO "ANTIFA"  DOES NOT EXIST  those Democrats like me who are AGAINST A FASCIST SOCIETY  are ANTI FASCIST  THE ONLY BOOGEYMAN IS TRUMP AND HIS GOP FLYING MONEY MORON SYCOPHANTS whose goal is a thug autocracy  NOT HAPPENING  #BurnTRUMPFAscismTOTheGROUND
You think the rednecks are Federalists? No, the GOP educated &amp; businessmen are, but the uneducated white guys--they don't identify with anyone but Trump.
Has he been like this all day? I've been hanging out among the mentally sound and I guess I've missed Trump's peak insanity for this week.
I WANT Biden &amp; Trump to debate.  I know Biden is going to use any excuse to avoid it but "We the People"  deserve to see it!
If Trump can suppress the vote, if foreign 'tinkering' puts election machine at risk, if a fake October Surprise steamrolls thru...that 30% could rule us all. And his crazies with guns are a danger to us all if he loses.
Afraid? No, not at all. I strongly support close ties with China and would greet any improvement in our relations with great joy. China is not my enemy, nor should it be. We are neighbors and we can work out our disputes like adults without Trump.
Yet somehow Trump is the dictator???
Trump. Abandoned. Allies. So Russia could kill them.
Everyone needs to keep in mind that Trump &amp; Pence's current terms end at 12:00 PM EST on January 20, no ifs, ands, or buts.  Congress will meet 2 weeks before then to do the official Electoral College vote count &amp; to declare a winner.   No court is going to overrule the process.

A dear friend? Trump is a malignant narcissist, a sociopath. He doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúdear friends‚Äù. He has people around him for their usefulness. Once they lose that he has no more use for them. He lacks humanity.
First, HCQ doesn't work &amp; is dangerous for many people. Second, CLOTH masks work only up to a point. Third, America has been doing vote-by-mail for decades &amp; it's legal. Finally, you've every legal right to vote in person, if you wish. It's never been an issue before tRump.  WHY?
As a parent, I want schools to open. But safely. Biden is FAR better than Trump &amp; he‚Äôll bring in better appointments.
Oh yeah - I've seen your tweets before. Profile says u r a  teacher and hate Trump.
I agree. I may live in the Northwest but I would read about the shady business of the tRump. I also knew people that fell for his con jobs. They were the ones years ago that told me tRumps were nothing but a joke in New York &amp; Donald snorted just about anything.
YES.  VOTE.   crawl on obsidian glass / spend hours filling out an absentee application / wait in line (with mask) for hours, with or without pizza &amp; water donations...but VOTE! The time spent is tiny TINY TINY compared to 4 more years w Trump.
Oh yes, the ignorance of it all.  Bet yet not one case in the homeless communities or the cough "Peaceful" protesting. Just the Trump Rally! Oh the woeful ignorant conservatives. Shame on them. Bad Bad bad. PLEASE! #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #ignoranceisbliss
I disagree the President sent out a condolence message, but the President is no hypocrite, John Lewis made no bones about the fact he didn‚Äôt like a President Trump and in truth John Lewis was very disrespectful to him! That being said I know the President sent üôèto his family!
You actually wish celebrities and democrats would die? War? You act like Democrats killed him. Trump Talley killed him.   You are absolutely frightening. Go back to jail.
Okay it time to take the gloves off on this mail in voting.    We have been mail in voting for years and it‚Äôs been safe. The only people who have been caught in mail fraud are GOP.  Options, drop off ballot
How evil is it that Trump killed Herman Cain with ineptitude and then called his mom to express his condolences
I totally agree: Trump needs to do whatever possible to release hydroxychloroquine.  The results will prove him right!  Action!!
My mom, a lifelong Democrat and shop steward of her Union just told me she no longer considers herself a Democrat. She hasn't quite come around to saying she's conservative and voting Trump but she is getting there!
It's what infuriated &amp; disgusted the electorate sufficiently to pave the way for Bush &amp; Trump. Let's keep doing this!  36 years of Republican-dominated Congress in the past 40 screams, "Let's do this again!!!" These people are easy pickings for con artists. Just speak eloquently.
Ok great, but can you give me something solid about this? I‚Äôm a lot more focused on the domestic terror that Trump enacts daily. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not paying attention‚Äù isn‚Äôt good enough when 1) FBI‚Äôs Russia probe ended in no consequences for Trump 2) he‚Äôs sending stormtroopers to Portland
I dont care if you're Democrat or Republican. For the love of God, read this thread. What Trump tweeted out today terrifies me.

Trump's superpower is sowing hatred
Thank you President Trump!
If anything, Trump inspires procreation if you detest the recessive gene pool in which Trump swims. Overwhelm that demon seed.
You might want to talk to the  man that Trump put in and told them to slow mail delivery. No proof of any harvesting.  Good for Trump voter, the rest of us not so much
What a classless jerk: resident trump engages in "spontaneous" photo-op to hijack some airtime and attention away from President Obama's eulogy for John Lewis.  There is no bottom.
I am not pissed. I am saddened. Just like election night 2016... I thought we were collectively better than that. To confront Trump supporters in an angry manner only feeds into that regressive mentality. We push onward and upward despite the resistance of ignorance.

Peak trump strikes again.
And You are still getting paid by the American people to stalk  Donald Trump‚Äôs Twitter account?  #Resign
He may have been a good person to you, a voice of reason on some issues. But he died listening to Trump. It's why I don't consider Trump supporters "Republicans." They're "Trumpublicans." That is what you should be mad about. The destruction of a party and it's people. Literally.
the rotten bastard, Trump IS going down
Yeah, I rely on the Trump fan club for accurate information on Biden and his family. üôÑ
you had your chance.  has Trump learned his lesson yet?
Trump and his entire family votes by mail.  His entire cabinet votes by mail.  5 states vote by mail.  What are you really afraid of?
With gerrymandering they trump should be able to win with like 40% of vote just like state legislators.     #tytlive
Trump himself is 74.
Yet Bill Barr&amp; Donald Trump and his family the past couple major of Elections   have voted by mail  the mail has been trusted by the GOP For years! Trump's Postmaster General has slowed down mail delivery nationally by cutting funding #GOPBetrayedAmerica
Even Trump recently admitted that people don‚Äôt like him or his personality!! Have fun in Denial Land and we‚Äôll see you in November ‚úåüèª
I think it‚Äôs because Trump is given the questions before the presser.  His staff turns those questions down.
We have had vote by mail in Oregon  long before Trump. There is a reason why almost everybody I know uses the ballot drop boxes instead of the postal system. And its not because they are too cheap to buy a stamp. Drop boxes are one solution to the concern about postal delays. No?
Ok who's lying? Kate Brown or Trump? We know from experience if Trumps mouth is moving, hes Lying. I guess we'll see.  She made this deal thru Pence, so I just don't know.
Protests are literally confined to a city block. Most are peaceful protesters. Yes there are idiots who just cause trouble. Trump escalated it fro. 75-100 people a night to 1000s.
Omg. My sister and I just watched your show on YouTube with the trump charade. At first we were annoyed by your commenting, but then noticed that you were making exactly the same points and laughing/gasping when we did. Thanks!

so trump just threatened oregon with united states military against American citizens in Portland if thats not fascist idk what is
Trump went on TV because he could NOT let a black man give an ulogy to another black man.   But, he did give respects to a black man who greatly financially supported his presidential campaign.   So you know where his values lie.
If you want to give Obama a chance at a third term, he can run against Trump in 2024. Or if you are scared, you can wait until 2028 when Trump is finished.
And the new FBI Building across from Trump‚Äôs Hotel? And the funds going into support for Trump‚Äôs golf /campaign weekends paid for by taxpayers? Need we go on? Your lunch expenses?

Scared? Trump sure sounds scared.
I'm a Oregon Patriot who believes that a federal agents shouldn't infringe on my 1st amendment rights.  Does that count or you only calling for the bootlickers asking for Trump's big government goons to quash states rights to speak up?
While Republicans across the nation have been quick to openly challenge Trump‚Äôs disturbing tweet today that proposed moving the date of the November election, Oregon‚Äôs Republican nominee for Secretary of State, Kim Thatcher, has kept noticeably quiet.
Why isn‚Äôt the press going for the jugular on this? Hilary email scandal, Trump trying to seize power from the people. Hmmm
tRump is trying to obstruct the election with ordering  the slowing down of the mail &amp; insisting on delaying the election.  It‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs the biggest inaccurate fraud this election has to deal with. What a sad pitiful person. What a sad pitiful time in the USA. #voteblue

Trump Rap. Sent from a friend in England.  It‚Äôs brilliant!

Hahah nah. Trump can‚Äôt stay on topic and speaks like a third grader. Oh by the way why are you so concerned with Hunter when Eric Trumps stole money from kids with cancer?
Trump can say what ever,  that doesn't magically change the election date.
The late comic Sid Caesar performed ‚Äúdouble-talk,‚Äù perfectly mimicking the sounds of foreign languages without speaking actual words. Trump mimics a serious tone, artificially conveying gravitas in a language that resembles English, yet doesn‚Äôt amount to more than gibberish.

Trump sounds like he is giving up on dealing with COVID-19. He's ruling out shutdowns which means he wants the virus to run its course.
You think Trump is bad wait for what comes next.
So Trump can retire at Mar-a-Lago and brood over his nothing accomplished in 4 years as POTUS life style? Sounds fair. Isn't it? He can't go back to NYC even to visit.
Delaying the election until COVID-19 is over would give Trump his life's dream:  PRESIDENT FOR LIFE w/Putie, Xi, &amp; Erdogan.

Well,  beat me to it, but Trump's probably doing this to distract everyone from the ghastly economic news just released this am, that 2nd Q GDP dropped 32%, and that was with a 10% bump in personal incomes from the stimulus payments. Keep your eye upon the doughnut!

Fascinating. In Granville's zip, Trump has 70 donors, Biden 111; Newark's zip has 219 for Trump, 157 for Biden. Neither is much over 60% to the leader (59 &amp; 61%), but anecdotally you'd think it was a much larger margin in either.
Honestly, I can believe that a hint of a suggestion about a possibility of bounties didn't make the PDB; what I don't get is not only flatly saying "I have never discussed it with him" but weirdly defending Russia arming the Taliban? Why go there?

Ok. The only reason that DHS has been dispatched by Trump to disrupt BLM protestors is because the narrative of protests against racism did not include him. So, he wasn't getting any press due to the BLM protests. He wanted to be part of the narrative. It's simple, guys. Think.

First, if $600 is enough to persuade an unemployed person to not return to their job, they deserve a larger paycheck. The minimum wage needs increased to provide a living wage.  Second, perhaps Trump &amp; the GOP should try living on $2400 month. They waste more on steaks &amp; hookers.
New approach to buying votes by Trump. End free markets for prescription drugs and institute price controls by executive order. Watch what happens. It won‚Äôt be pretty.
Trump &amp; Putin spoke yesterday, so he said. But not about #RussiaBountyGate. More about something else, like stealing the next election. And the press ppl there, no courage to push the issue. We shall never forget.
Not a word in the   about the substance of Joe Biden's housing plan. Not. A. Word. But by all means, go after Trump for trivial nonsense.

Hell, Trump has bilked US citizens out of millions with visits to his own property - charging outrageous rates for Secret Service using golf carts and rooms and such.   Or is looting okay when rich white Republicans do it?

Senator Kennedy said he seen 175 million to a corporation for public radio. I wonder who has stock in it or is it trump trying to buy a propaganda radio station with tax payer money.

Hearing the mashed potatoes story confirms for me that donald trump üçäis and will never get over President Barack Obama roasting him at that correspondence dinner.üëå
Obama helped 15 million citizens get health insurance - Trump is taking coverage from 30 million, his employment debacle has cost millions coverage as they lost their jobs.  Obama increased regulation for a cleaner, safer country; Trump has gutted regulations and regulators.
Trump unemployment rate is 11.1%, in April it was 14.7%.  Obama took office with 10% unemployment,  left with 4.7%.  Trump did have 3.5% unemployment at one point, but that was an improvement over Obama of only 1.2% and it was clearly part of the Obama trend.

I think once it‚Äôs life and death, the political BS should stop. Trump feels otherwise. Respect to Herman Cain. He was a black man that ran for president! He deserves more respect than what Trump gave him. Felt like an afterthought.
Well, Trump‚Äôs funeral will be at Red Square, so Putin will be the speaker.   Hell, Putin might even put on a big military parade in Trump's memory.
He‚Äôs probably just saying this to be on the right side of history, so when trump contests the election he can say ‚Äúsee! I told you so!‚Äù

Well. You aren‚Äôt thinking here so perhaps you should see what it‚Äôs like there. In a dictatorship. Like Trump desires to instill here. With your fucking permission.
Lock Trump up
If your talking either Bush. They are way smarter then Trump will ever be. Plus they new how to talk.
She‚Äôs right. Ohioans deserve representation that is not tainted by greed or deceit. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm NOT voting for that Russian sympathizer Donald Trump.
"What will happen in November - it's a mess," Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. "I want a result much, more more than you...I don't want to be waiting around around for weeks and months."
Yup killed Herman Trump doesn‚Äôt care only cares about himself and maybe Ivanka can‚Äôt folks see that
Fearing Trump interference, FBI agents hid copies of Russia investigation docs
Sounds good to every democrat and Trump hater in the country. Nancy Pelosi will become our first female president. Oh! Didn‚Äôt read our constitution, did you? Perhaps you should.
President Trump, please please please, never miss a good opportunity to shut up! I will be voting for you, but please....
Donald Trump. Is nothing but a lier.
Reminder: Trump promised to protect both in 2016. He has tried to cut both and Social Security as well.  We can't let him get a second term. He's already said he'll go after them.
You took the words right off of my fingertips. Of course, Trump will still blame Obama. Always and forever.
She didn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs a passive aggressive trump supporter victim magabot.
That was terribly painful. I don‚Äôt want to be succumbed to this again. Fuck Trump.
I am happy to hear that. It just another of Trump's attempts to task up his base.
PS- Trump: ‚ÄúLouie Gohmert who?‚Äù
Donald J. Trump: ‚ÄúHerman who?‚Äù

Careful, Trump will make this guy Surgeon General tomorrow if he sees this clip! Great clip, btw!
Trump does think about that. He truly thinks he can do what ever he wants.
Danielle, the election date is written in the Constitution. Trump‚Äôs just obfuscating and trying to deflect from the horrible news cycle regarding the economy, COVID-19 deaths and, of course, John Lewis‚Äô funeral. Pay no attention to the idiot behind the curtain...
He died from Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa. Period.
Sad that you lose all of the good will that you muster in trying to keep Trump straight; Do Not Play into Trump's hands by suggesting th; at the Dems are sitting here waiting to cheat, which is a lie.  You do your personal integrity harm when you bandy words like this about.

F#ck you Trump! If the United States military could vote during the Civil War, WWI and WWII then the sovereign citizens of a America can vote during a pandemic by mail with no problem. You will not highjack our right to kick your ass out of our White House you treasonous bastard!
For those who think the #Trump #Election2020 #Delay is unlikely - his #Section232 #steeltariffs were designated as "Least Likely" among possible unilateral trade measures before he entered office. #Vote2020
I‚Äôm not gleeful, any more than when Jim Jones killed a bunch of his followers. That was a cult, just like the rabid pack of Trump supporters who believe his bullshit. You‚Äôre just seeing the results of drinking Trump‚Äôs Kool Aid.
Every state should have the super-wonderful early voting organization that NC voters enjoy.  Our "One-Stop" voting is a form of 'absentee voting' that Donald Trump cannot stop.
No, that‚Äôll be when Ivanka gets it and Trump gets to watch her die from a hoax.

I‚Äôd say the reverse is more true. It‚Äôs getting bashed on because Trump‚Äôs dumb ass pushed it lol. All I‚Äôm saying is banning medicine that‚Äôs been in circulation for 60 years for political reasons is poor judgment imo.
Well, that, at least is good to hear. Even if trump gets re-elected, he‚Äôll be out in 2024. No military coup for him!
idk man trump could loan them money to make a vaccine
great fakeout by overnight futures to grab one last dip before next markup. the trump tweet in the am further solidified a drop in action to secure low buy, the 9:15 reversal tweet from mconnell was planned.
Since HHS took over the numbers, you may not even be informed that your area is a hot spot. Betsy Devoss and her circle of vampire elites want their batch'o'fuck, &amp; they don't care who dies. Donald Trump needs kids in school so parents are at work, he also doesn't care who dies.
Absolutely agree! Trump needs to read our Constitution...he is not the ultimate power he thinks he is! More like the devil incarnate actually!
Aww a true Trump minion. Only for your self. Right?
Particularly since he recently called out Biden for warning that Trump would do exactly this.
#PhuckHermanCain and phuck the idiots who think like him. Do a rain dance on his dead ass. Trump literally is killing his rich followers,  good!!!
Herman Cain is dead...I guess Trump just lost a vote. Allow me to say full throated üñï Herman Cain and everything he stood for. The earth is better because he is dead! Full stop!
Look at all the people who‚Äôll be either dead or too sick to vote from Trump in November. We need more of these dumb fucks getting together.
He should. But he won't. Trump not capiable of feeling anything.
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is for the first time publicly floating a "delay" to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Herman Cain died for being a stupid ass, rich fuck who trusted Trump! I have zero empathy for him. Herman,  you could have chosen a deferent path but you chose Red and now your dead! Bye , bye stupid!
Thursday night‚Äôs anti-Netanyahu rally won‚Äôt face time limit ‚Äî report  via   Who's behind it? Probably the same against Trump and USA. But t hey will not succeed.
Don‚Äôt assume you know how anyone else feels.  I believe myself, and am seeing ‚Äútragedy‚Äù all SM‚Äîbut you‚Äôre going to have to just suck it up and accept that it‚Äôs because he followed Trump‚Äôs lead.  That‚Äôs where opinions diverge.
Trump supporter and former presidential candidate Herman Cain  has died from #COVID19.   How does the  campaign react?   They still send out a fundraising email. Cause so much winning. üôÑ
President Donald Trump is for the first time publicly floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
This comes as no surprise. Trump has lied about this 1/4 and the stock market. If they stop buying and selling bonds on it. The stock market will be next.
A virus does not care about your politics. But your politics will affect how you respond to it. Don't be like Herman Cain or Trump. Take it seriously. Please.
No he can not. He does not have the power. Congress would have to make a change . In which they won't. Trump knows he is looseing.
Cain attended the Tulsa rally without a mask.  Following Trump blindly means greater risk of getting the Trump Virus.  Getting the Trump Virus can kill you.  I hope Mr Cain rests in peace &amp; I hope anybody who listens to Trump will instead educate themselves
Trump doesn't care, all he cares about is the election.
"Congress has the power. I can't foresee Congress changing the date of the election."
I am happy to risk my health by going to vote in order to defeat this miserable human being Trump.   I will mask up &amp; go out and vote.  Everybody needs to vote
My whole life, I actually thought that even if I didn't like a person's politics that getting to the National level of governance required a decent intellectual and leadership level. I questioned this with Trump but the last 48 hours of "masks made me sick, and demons" wrong.
Agree there are many good candidates, though just like the election that put this idiot in the the white house, a vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. We have to trust &amp; believe that since Biden has been in the front seat before he will listen &amp; hear his advisors .
Trumps setting himself up as our first king since George III. Trump should read a history book to see what the Americans did to King George III, his army and sycophants. There will be no king trump in our America, you can bet your ass on that! So to the wannabe king I say ....
If a sitting President figures out a way to delay the presidential election, Democracy is dead in the USA. Please, everyone, vote  We can‚Äôt survive 4 more years of Trump.

I have my request ready to mail in for my "Mail in" ballot. So many in my family just won't vote, because "well, Trump won even though he lost, so why bother..." but I'm not giving up. This is my niece's first real election. She's the only one ready to go.

Not only did trump vote by mail but he also registered and cast a Florida ballot when his residence and the residence of all US Presidents is 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington DC. DC carries 3 electoral votes while Florida carries 29... how ya like them apples?

I think we as Americans are just getting too fed up with all of this BS. I mean,  we've always been a country with our share of problems, be it racism, police brutality,  drugs....but Trump is bringing us closer to utter destruction as a country. We have to heal!
They're just trying to make excuses for Trump getting utterly stomped in  November. These Trumptards and Senate Republicans know what's coming in November! We are going to wipe out the Republican party and they know it. Prepare for more of this bullshit as we get closer.
Trump wears more make-up than Lindsey Graham on a Saturday night!
Well the way I see it is we already have a racist president who is also a idiot,  so just like Trump asked us black people,  what do I have to lose voting for Biden? I'm voting in person so it doesn't matter.
There is no proof of any of this. Trump commissioned a investigation after 2016 and it found nothing.
Lol guess you can not see. Trump loves Putin has for along time. He idolized him before he was in office. He has always been in aww of Putin. Look up Trump's history.
Lol Trump is a idiot and will do whatever Russia wants.
Thank you Susan for putting yourself and Trump before country. You‚Äôve made it much easier for the people of our Republic to recognize the treasonous GOP representatives who want to destroy democracy. You will lose and will never be heard from again. Oh and just one more thing....

Ohio Pharmacy Board has banned the use of hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted by President Trump - to treat COVID-19. They said people should not be "exposing themselves to drugs that have shown not to be effective."
You do the crime then you do the time. Bill Barr it's doing Trump's bidding for him.
But you rubber stamp Trump‚Äôs nominee to run the USPS, who would do all he can to eliminate this valuable service to rural Ohio! Can‚Äôt you see the contradiction?
Exclusive: Trump never raised Russia's Taliban bounties with Putin...he will never have the backs of US soldiers.

A verse from Esther for President Trump: Haman came against Mordecai, but his wife and friends told him he had begun to fall , "You shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him." Est. 6:13." When Trump was elected, they began to fall, they will not prevail.

A stupid weak leader is a danger to our democracy. The Republic is treading water &amp; trump is the anchor that‚Äôs pulling us under. If he remains unchecked &amp; free to do as he pleases we will be forever under Russian control. This is not a conspiracy theory or a threat, it is a fact!
Kamala would make one bad ass AG! She would have the crooks from Trumps administration pay for what they did to our Republic and it‚Äôs citizens. Harris would make the the head of the crime family, Trump, pay for his treasonous acts! Kamala would make our country safe from tyranny!
How can you blame the chaos in cities on anyone but the current president? Logically speaking wouldn‚Äôt a vote for  end the manufactured chaos that Trump created? Isn‚Äôt creating problems &amp; then claiming to be for Law&amp;Order an authoritarian move? Thoughts?

Oh, so that‚Äôs what Trump and Putin discusses on their recent phone call. SMH...
In the age of information stupidly is a choice, I would hope that you would do the research prior to making comments that are totally wrong. If President Trump followed the advice of the commudemos he would not have done anything
Another reminder that abuse of state power ‚Äúendangers our democracy.‚Äù
Once the election is over, Trump doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the election anymore. He‚Äôll be free to do what‚Äôs necessary then.
If them going more nutso is possible, I hope Trump is ready to quell any violence quickly and swiftly.
All of the Trump backers? That proves it‚Äôs you people that are the problem. Lumping every Trump backer under one umbrella. Trump said there were fine people on both sides of the issue of removing the statue. He condemned those who commit acts of violence, you ideological idiot.
Ummm, let‚Äôs start with Susan Collins refusing to remove an obviously corrupt Donald Trump during impeachment?
If there‚Äôs a Trump victory and more riots, hopefully with the election behind him he can take the gloves off and do what needs to be done to end them.
I‚Äôm soooooo scared of the threats made by you and the president regarding Biden that I‚Äôll have to vote for Trump. DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE BELIEVES YOUR BULLSHIT? IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

So because Jones, who is black and a Democrat, supports Trump, he isn‚Äôt black enough to the liberal. I‚Äôm sure there are other liberals who feel the same way. Identity politics is very racist. You‚Äôre not beholden to one party because of your race.
These idiots are just whining because they aren‚Äôt getting what they want. That‚Äôs all. The real racism is the pandering and the identity politics. Georgia State Rep. Vernon Jones tweeted a video of himself saying he supports Trump, and someone told him it doesn‚Äôt make him white.

Is it just me, or was AG* Barr's hands...shaking? Especially when questioned by Democrats? And he's deliberately stalling to waste their time, but lets the republidicks wander around as bad as tRump.. #BarrHearing
Yes their sticking to the Trump playbook. Blame the left.
Long story short, tRump got himself a doctor that said his hydro whateveritis worked (it doesn't) and that also sex with a demon and being impregnated by demon spawn causes this "issue"...
Donald Trump Jr ALSO has limited functionality for 12 hours.
Apparently Trump thinks all of us are in nursing homes. Meanwhile, the White House doesn‚Äôt tell us that hospitals off-load Covid patients to nursing homes so they have room for more patients, therefore increasing illness in homes. Trump and his White House propaganda arm deceive.
President Donald Trump pushed unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, is an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This "video" he's showing is as bad as the trump video ad that keeps talking about "Biden's America" that's LITERALLY what's happening DUE TO TRUMP... jfc this is sickening
. U.S. Intelligence Officers were HEROES to pick up treasonous contact between Trump WH operatives &amp; the Kremlin;  Pres. Obama &amp; VP Biden saved our nation, no doubt, by following through with the investigation.

Help!!   Even my 8 year old niece and grandson know that the tRump ad they saw today on our local Fox channel is bullshit (In Biden's Amercia), but we haven't seen anything against him! This is in #Ohio
Truth hurts Trump.
Trump‚Äôs path is actually a path to prison.
Go back and look at Nixon‚Äôs GOP ads and it‚Äôs the same tactics different decade. The GOP has nothing to run on so they revert back to the old playbook. Trumps new campaign manager thinks Americans are stupid and don‚Äôt know our own history. We‚Äôre not Trump and we remember.

Please say no to drugs. You love Trump so much. Move to Russia. Putin is the master puppet! So you want a man that encourages violence, breaks laws, blames everyone but himself. He told ppl to snort Clorox! I you fucking kidding me. Wow please don‚Äôt wear a mask!
These were big boys. Two things you don‚Äôt bring up in Ireland. Religion and Trump.

I met John McLane and John Glen in 8th grade. War hero and space hero!! Trump being a asshole!! Noo? Haha. It don‚Äôt surprise me.
Who did he rape? Is this like Obamacare? When Trump swore that what Obama did will go down in history. He claim we all knew but never came out with it.

It's so interesting to me that he died from #COVID19 at a Trump Rally. He and Trump are the same age. Trump is worth a little over $2B, and Cain is worth a little over $2M, so both are in the 1%. I'd guess Cain was healthier than Trump. But he contracts the virus and dies?

It is very difficult to muster up sympathy for a man who mocked this virus and dared it to take him by not wearing a mask and attending a Trump rally. Well, the virus did take him and this hopefully will serve as a cautionary tale for those who are stupid enough to be like Cain.
Two things are very, very true today:   Donald Trump doesn't have a new tone and the Ohio Republican Party isn't suddenly committed to doing the right thing.
Trump wants to #delaytheelection.  The Constitution provides no mechanism for doing so. None. Period.  We literally held an election during the Civil War to prove the point.
...but the lesser evil WON'T BE TRUMP! and I think that's the point.

Can we deport Donald Trump then?
Trump must think we‚Äôre stupid or something
Wow. The death of expertise. It‚Äôs just another symptom in Trump‚Äôs America
Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 election in a tweet Thursday. It is unprecedented in its explicit suggestion to delay the election. The President doesn't have that power. It would require a change of federal law and could not be put in place unless approved by Congress.
Early on in contracting the virus. Which almost never happens because symptoms don't usually show up until a week or two after you have it. It's not a cure or a treatment and the only reason it's getting propped up is because Trump's dumbass pushed it.
?????? "President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters were seen lining up for a rally in Pennsylvania after the death of Herman Cain. Cain, who was 74, was thought to have contracted COVID-19 at a presidential rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma earlier this summer."
Trump of course!
This is why Trump won - the alternative candidate put forward by the GOP establishment is using a man's death to score political points against Trump and Trump supporters.  When this is what Conservatism Inc. stands for, I'll take Trump any day.
Propor context. "Sadly , there will be cruelty online at Cain‚Äôs expense. But the real cruelty, which has no shame or even recognition of its inhumanity, is the organized resistance of the American right wing under Trump to preventing tens of thousands of needless deaths."
Donald Trump is a dictator. Pass it on.
Conservative elitists are worse people and have worse judgment than Trump on his worst day.  McMullin not only is wickedly politicizing Herman's death, his claim of science denial is projection, given that more scientific evidence shows masks don't work than do work.
And this reminder: "In the hours before President Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, his campaign directed the removal of thousands of ‚ÄúDo Not Sit Here, Please!‚Äù stickers from seats in the arena that were intended to establish social distance between rallygoers."
If Trump uses covid-19 as an excuse to push back the elections the virus will quickly go away!!
And corrupt Trump is the one to do it? I feel like you might be missing something or not truly understanding. Because everything you just described is basically Trump. So how, in your mind, would you think that would make things better?
Herman Cain ‚Äî a former Republican presidential candidate, Trump surrogate and businessman ‚Äî died Thursday morning after a month-long battle with the coronavirus.
Well, let's say the GOP states move the election, and in doing so, miss the cut off for reporting the results to the House of Representatives...  If that happened, Trump is still *automatically* out of office at noon on 1/20.  It's not up to him to release power.
Adam, let's be honest here. You don't really give a shit one way or the other. All you care about is spinning and lying to try and make Trump look bad. Germany is behind in their NATO fees so we're bringing some of the troops home to get Merkel's attention.
Let's try to get this straight. Herman Cain was at Trumps rally in Tulsa June 20. Herman Cain died of covid19 today. Ergo Trump killed Cain.

He died from the Trump virus
I am dumbfounded that Herman Cain died from a hoax. I guess people are willing to die for Trump...go figure.
The 20th Amendment states that the term of the President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January. ‚ÄúTherefore, if the presidential election were somehow not held, Trump would not simply continue to hold office,‚Äù according to law professor Edward Foley.
Maybe he shouldn't have attended Trump's COVID party in Tulsa. Maybe he should have constantly worn a mask.

But it literally is happening under Trump. Right now. And he's commanding the lawlessness.

The US is moving forward with Trump's plan to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany a decision that has  bipartisan congressional opposition and upset key allies who see the move as a blow to NATO. The plan will cost billions to execute and take years to relocate the troops.

To generalise people this much is so pointless and if you genuinely think all trump supporters are like this it is plain wrong. There are so many normal people who just cannot support Dems with the Barr hearing like that where we couldn‚Äôt even hear his responses.
Here lies Donald Trump.. Be our guest and take a dump
Dump trump
Trump canceled first pitch with Yankees ‚Äî but Yankees reportedly hadn‚Äôt even invited him
A picture of Trump as a Kid..... ü§°
Biden‚Äôs gotta clean this up. 1. The term ‚Äúanarchist‚Äù is being used by Trump to demonize protestors. 2. There are people with legitimate anarchist political beliefs that have committed no crime.
Contrary to President Donald Trump‚Äôs repeated claims that he inherited a Strategic National Stockpile with "empty" or "bare" cupboards, the federal government had more ventilators in stock than it ended up distributing amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Well.... if their democrats they‚Äôd rather die than do anything Trump would suggest, so I‚Äôm guessing zero.

Trump's not going to be there so I don't think so. Maybe tomorrow though.
During Trump‚Äôs reign of WTFism, his conservative Supreme Court has by far been the bright spot. Most humans, unlike Trump, are not solidly liberal or conservative on all issues as recent SCOTUS decisions prove.
If y‚Äôall support Trump, unfollow me.
You could not have been a Marine. All of the Marines I now understand integrity and honesty and how important it is. This guy Trump spoke about a war hero John McCain so disgracefully. His mouth is disturbing, and full of lies. Not forgiven.
I hope for the next 50 years, EVERY President blames everything on Trump.
Hey y‚Äôall I think ‚Äòtrump‚Äô is an acronym for ‚ÄòTerrible, Racist,Useless &amp; Major Predator‚Äù which, ironically, is exactly what that man is. #TrumpIsALoser #TrumpVirus #Biden2020
Swalwell: Barr has taken Michael Cohen's job as Trump's fixer
Sure let‚Äôs not censor her claiming you can fix medical ailments with demon sperm too!!!! Why didn‚Äôt Trump or you feel the need to share that????
Trump knows he‚Äôs wrong for having that commercial with somebody breaking in that old lady‚Äôs home talking about ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äôs America will not be safe because he calls for defunding the police‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt even say that.
Trump really needs to stop adlibing because it just sounds stupid. '25% is a big number' oh blow it out the ass jeez

He lies like Trump. Barr will backpedal anything he says. Those who really know how to be SHADY on the stand know there is always some legal gib jab to protect themselves
More proof that Trump has Alzheimers. Not a joke and I cannot confirm. Too many experts say signs include PAST being confused with present. Maybe that's why he keeps touching Ivanka. Or maybe thinks Ivanka is Ivana
Heres your friendly daily reminder that a vote for trump, is a vote for a pedophilic rapist...
are you working for trump?  because it really seems like you are on his payroll.  or perhaps feel so deeply he should be elected again you are volunteering your time to make that happen
Please excuse me while is silently scream in head while my coworker talks to me about not believing the coronavirus is ‚Äúas deadly as they make it out to be‚Äù and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just using it to push out Trump‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see how ‚Äòdeadly‚Äô it is come November‚Äù üò∑ü§¢üòë
So then why make the false claim about this being the entire country under Biden when it's happening right now under Trump?
This is literally America under Trump. Like, right now. It's happening RIGHT NOW.
Okay. "Trump‚Äôs New COVID Doctor Says Sex With Demons Makes You Sick"  The president is pushing the coronavirus theories of a Houston doctor who also says sexual visitations by demons and alien DNA are at the root of Americans‚Äô common health concerns.
Trump showed up one time because he heard "chick" and "pee" and thought it was his kinda place.
Trump is correct that he was effectively incapable of doing anything other than what he has done. That leaves the deaths of 144,000 Americans on the hands of everyone who voted for him and on the hands of the GOP Senate who refused to uphold the rule of law, and impeach him.
The problem with the Barr Hearing is that William Barr is a crooked, professional liar and the Republicans will never reprimand him for anything. Disbarment might be in play after Barr leaves office, but  meanwhile he will continue to be Trump' AG Roy Cohn.  #BarrHearing #Barr
Trump's latest approvel rating for handling of the virus-32% Oh and this is an achievement he'll be proud of-A Texan dies every 6 minutes from COVID.

There are now 150,000 US fatalities due to covid-19 with estimates of over 88,500 of them due to the actions and inactions of President Trump and his administration. Do not let him and the Republican Party change the narrative. These ‚Äúnumbers‚Äù represent people who have died.
A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump is back to spreading misinformation about how to combat the virus and the credibility of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation‚Äôs leading infectious disease expert.
Anyone would be better than Trump.  A corpse would be better than Trump.  A squirrel would be better than Trump.  Chucky from Child‚Äôs Play would be better than Trump.

You make claims but have no proof whatsoever. Sounds just like Trump.
If Russia were to interfere in the 2016 election. What did Obama do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Keep in mind he was still in office until Trump was sworn in two months later. So if Russia did help Trump win then it's Obama's fault for doing nothing. Obama was still the president.
I have a Trump joke but it fails miserably
It's hard to be an American, Bc we should all be equal &amp; free. But hatred, lies, &amp; Trump, Are destroying our ability to be.  I'd gladly stand up next to you, &amp; defend her still today. Cuz there ain't no doubt I love this land, Please God- help Truth, Science, &amp; Fauci lead the way

Gonna be hilarious when all those felons vote for trump... doh!
Trump also lost his mind and took a noisy minority with him.
That's foolish and unfounded. Nancy Pelosi was dancing in Chinatown in February saying there is no worry. Joe Biden said Trump was xenophobic and racist for stopping flights from China. Try making sense for a change.
I agree, because it's horrifying and I think it would hurt Trump like it did in 2018.
ANYTHING Trump is for, the left is against.  If Trump said protesting was actually curing the virus, everyone would go home.

Trump and his supporters has been known to lie. Why should we believe in anything his so called experts have to say. The man has no education in regards to his position. He has no medical training, but he claims that he has all this medical treatment to help prevent Covid-19.
Low income. Read: Minorities. This may be the most racist thing ever tweeted by Trump out of a whole long list of racist things. Only done to get the suburban vote. If he cared it would have been done 3 years ago. #Trash
You are kidding, right?? How in the world can you make the correlation between what Dr. Fauci says to the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äú or ‚Äúfake news‚Äú trying to make sure Trump is not reelected? He‚Äôs doing a good job of that all by himself.

He had someone in charge finally raising interest rates to save this country from an inevitable economic downfall but trump cut him short bc with higher interest %‚Äôs come a hit to the stock market and our ‚Äúeconomically genius‚Äù president decided to turn his back on.
Yikes hearing Peter Schiff go on a 3 hour rant made me realize you have to be a giant stupid ass to think anything Trump has done has been good for the economy. Our economy is a heroin addict and all he does in inject more drugs(money) in it to save his own ass for votes.

Biden has declining dementia. We all know it,the Dems are keeping him out of the public eye. What about the debates. One other thing,he blames President Trump for everything,you can only take that so far, eventually Biden needs to come out of his home and answer direct questions.

Trump has said he cares about all of America.  He said this way back when he was on Oprah Winfrey amongst many others - the term MAGA even states it.  Jobs that help American people get back on their feet-tax breaks so we can keep more of our paycheck-and that is just 2 examples.
I was gonna apologize. At first I assumed you were a bot so had no problem making fun of your physical appearance. Then I saw you still support trump and realize you might not be a twitter bot but are still a thoughtless drone
That is funny, thanks for the laugh. Kasich, never another dime to you sir. You've lost me. Not telling you to back Trump but you're done in my book. Best for you to SHUT UP. You quit, you never ran it out to the end. I didn't vote Trump in 2016 but DEFINITELY VOTING TRUMP 2020
Senator, you are in lockstep with all of the Republicans who support Trump's misdeeds and lack of morals, so honestly, you are in no position to talk about who deserves what and what is right vs. wrong.  Grow a pair and then we'll listen

Btw, you were completely lying about the circumstances of Trump calling Tim Cook, Tim Apple. He was not going around a table of execs asking them to speak.
Agreed, Trump has no right to delay the election. Thank you.
Lol. That not even remotely what happened. Trump even tried to claim afterwards he said Tim Cook from Apple so fast no one heard it.
How could he possibly tell Trump to focus on things that matter? That‚Äôs all Trump has done.
When Trump is dead and buried and the long lines of patriots waiting to urinate on his grave have eased off, I might just start to begin to find a hint of compassion for his utterly deplorable followers

It's time to stop being Nice to Trump. He's destroying our country and is an Evil stain on American history. You're not alone!
Trump's is Gross and perversely Vain! Who else wear blatantly fake makeup like that.
"Winning" will be prosecuting all of Trump's friends and family that are benefitting from this impending economic depression that Trump's leading us toward.
So at any moment we can be expecting White, gun-toting, confederate flag waving, little men to be storming the White House to "Peacefully" protest the Martial Law that Trump is floating.. Right? Right???
Trump's blatant interference in the mission of the USPS will be another reason to impeach him by voting him out! Trump's interference is slowing down commerce and personal communications for all Americans. His futile attempts will bear no evil fruits as it affects every American
I don't think Herman Cain's death by #TrumpVirus will sway any Republican's responsibility to wear a mask to protect other people. Take one look at the fund raiser for Trump in Texas. Nobody wearing a mask including Trump. It's as though it's a patriotic notion to die of Covid19
1 day extra of Trump's being in office means 1000s more people die, the economy gets worse  and our civil rights degrade. #NoElectionDelay
Not at all surprised. Fortunately Congress has set Election Day and Trump can‚Äôt override it...unless he tries to declare martial law and suspend Congress. I think he‚Äôll try it and we must stop him. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #Resist

I'm glad Trump doesn't have an editor or filter for his dumbass comments. It's going to cost him his reelection by proving his ignorance.
How do we prevent Trump from manipulating the USPS for mail in ballots?
You‚Äôre a broken record. How about you answer one question: Are you ok with 4 more years of where Trump is taking us?  Yes or no. Don‚Äôt wuss out and talk whole bunch of shit- Yes or no
All those Republicans who cried about the states enacting Martial Law during the shut downs, better be the first people standing up to stop Trump from doing it to stop an election.
Uh I can do two things at once. I can know Trump is bad and also like the things our Dem candidate will strive for. Only babies stamp their feet when they don‚Äôt get precisely what they want
It's our only chance of ending the Covid-19 nightmare sooner. Trump can't distribute PPEs let alone a safe vaccine!
Policy on: health care, abortion rights, gun safety, voting protections, environmental protections, gay rights, education, overhauling police, etc etc. you boys are temperamental twits who ignore policies and issues and just ‚Äúhaha, you are Trump!‚Äù üëåüèΩ
Over 40 years ago? Yeah! Like now. Like he will do now. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre stuck in the past. Some of us are trying to make the future better. But you do you‚Äîhelp Trump, pathetic little toddler
Do you see what Trump is doing daily? Do you know what he did today? Stfu now with Biden. I will take ANY adult over a child at this point. I‚Äôll take my 20th candidate over him. I‚Äôll do what it takes to save the citizens of this country
Also, you‚Äôre just mad Bernie is out. We got what we got. It‚Äôs Biden or Trump. That‚Äôs the choice. There is no other choice. If someone offered you literal shit to eat or decent but not perfect meal, you gonna really eat shit or starve to death? Stop being a 2 year old
The biggest swamp ever is the one that trump is in the middle of . We will not accept a delay in the biggest election ever We will vote him out and send him back to the hell hole he came from
F*** you Trump. 96 days and you are out of here
The real Donald Trump. His voters are just a means to his ends. He cares not one whit about you.
So Trump's incessant lying and confabulation is entirely intentional?
Why? That's idiotic and proves very little. Trump was just repeating what was in front of him at the moment.
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.
Trump is the biggest asshole. #NobodyLikesTrump probably gonna burn in hell.
Oh so who then? And get Oprah off your profile. I betcha you‚Äôre white. Stop fronting like YOU aren‚Äôt racist. If you help Trump in any way, you‚Äôre racist.
Oh so you probably want Kamala then For VP for calling him on his past !? Cool. At least you can get behind the VP. Better than Trump, right? Or will you stay home if it‚Äôs not Bernie?
‚ÄúI feel like the guy working for Bernie Madoff who thought they were actually beating the market.‚Äù    Def getting the book.  via
Not in print but can forward you Mideast cites. As for the Trump as Mideast Tyrant, the idea writes itself!
No, it‚Äôs not. Just because we did it, doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt call out Russia for it. That‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs point and he is wrong. Imagine being in the military right now and your commander in chief doesn‚Äôt have your back.
Trump must go!
Why anyone would want to destroy any part of our winning against Trump is insanity
Repub Mike Rogers just said ‚Äú it makes my blood boil‚Äù to hear Trump say he‚Äôs not asked Putin about $$ to Taliban as bounty for killing American troops &amp; he never received info about it.
Tara Reade has the same reputation for honesty as Kayleigh and Kellyanne and Trump.
Those ~3 months between Trump losing and Biden being sworn in are going to be fucking nuts
Vladimir Putin wants to help Trump get reelected.
We all know that‚Äôs a joke cause trump would never offer up his parachute to anyone
There is not a bigger swamp than the one that trump sits in the middle of right now
I hadn‚Äôt even seen this 25th thing floating for anyone but Trump. Can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve never pulled it for Trump.
No,that would be donald trump
You rock! Thanks for not letting up on trump. He was so afraid of you that he ran awayüñêüñêüñêüëç
No you didn't take crazy pills but I think Trump didüëçü§£ üëáüëá
Your performance today was criminal. I cant wait for  the report you all want to suppress comes out so I can rejoice with glee as you are all led away in hand cuffs. Long live Trump and down with the crooked far left. Your reign is over.
Hey    In case you haven‚Äôt seen this one....  Barbara Walters Exposed Trump's Massive Debt &amp; Admiration For Hitler's Speeches In 1990!
Trump's new Pandemic advisor. Stella Immanuel.
Trump's new Pandemic advisor! Stella Immanuel. Google it!
Trump's new Pandemic advisor!
Stop Trump's New FBI Building 1,750,000,000 to go to who?
Postal service is key to defeating Trump. He's already trying to kill the  USPS.
Stop Trump from killing the USPS!
I hope we can stop Trump's new FBI Building Scam.
This is Bullshit that people can be kidnapped at Trump's will!
Trump will try to sell Americans an unproven  vaccine in October in an attempt to save his ass.
Yeah and stupid people in the suburbs will vote Biden because Trump hurts their feelings
If Biden was 1/100th as corrupt as Trump and running against a decent human being, I woukd not vote for him.
Trump is a desperate man. He's willing to do anything to stay in power. SDNY is waiting for the entire Trump family.
A desperate statement from a desperate man. Trump will probably spend billions on the Russian vaccine that was promoted today.
Astra-Zenica (England) is further along in their trials. I recall Trump making a multi-billion deal dollar with them  recently.
Kodak was on top when they made film for your camera. I think we're well past that now? Trump's proposal to Kodak proves how corrupt and out of touch  he actually is.
Fu*k no! Trump is going to buy the Russian vaccine just announced today! That explains why Trump called Putin 3 times last week.
Another shady Trump deal in the Works!
Pre-coronavirus Trump was doing a good job, he produced (job numbers) but was being a terrible leader (Twitter jfc) Remove the results and there is no reason to vote for him other than a vote against Democrats.
Desantis is as bad maybe worse than Trump. I didn't think it was possible.
#trump isacrybaby
That‚Äôs called arrogance and bullheadness....and the knowledge that Trump has his back ( or ass).
It‚Äôs a bully tactic. They are never confident. Trump is prime example. Too bad Jordon isn‚Äôt serving on another committee with Schiff. Gym is an insolent toad.
I think our French friends will be equally happy that Trump is gone. They're bound to help us out with Champaign.
Black for Trump...that in itself is an oxymoron. Emphasis on moron!!!
Fuck you Lindsy....what do YOU know about law....except Trump‚Äôs.
Check his phone for tweets from Trump.
Trump doesn't recognize anything or anyone that distracts attention away from himself. Trump knows that John Lewis is a man that he could never be.
Right back at you with Barr‚Äôs ‚Äúnot interfering‚Äù with Trump‚Äôs cohorts in court. Astoundingly false! Maybe you could pass Gym Jordon a Midol, LadyG. He‚Äôs a bit hysterical. #BarrsLieFest
Donald Trump is a facist.
Trump has the time to whine about what's trending on Twitter?
There's a cure for this problem for sure; Block Trump!
Trump is, #AmericasGreatestMistake
I mean I live near Dayton, Trump is still pretty popular here.
What did Joe Biden EVER DO FOR BLACK AMERICANS? Answer: NOTHING! Why do you expect him to suddenly change and do something now? What did Trump do? Lowered Black unemployment to LOWEST IN HISTORY, created economic opportunity zones in cities, first crime bill to help blacks, etc
You don‚Äôt have any facts with your tweet. You‚Äôre as bad as ABC CBS NBC CNN MSNBC NY Times WASHINGTON POST, you just make up FAKE comments!!! Face it - Joe Biden is WRONG FOR AMERICA and YOU KNOW IT!!! AMERICA NEEDS TRUMP!!!
Joe Biden‚Äôs ideas are BAD FOR AMERICA! Joe Biden‚Äôs ideas would take AMERICA IN THE WRONG DIRECTION! Joe Biden and the Democratic Socialist Party are UNAMERICAN!!!  VOTE FOR TRUMP! Keep America on the path of FREEDOM AND LIBERTY FOR ALL AMERICANS!!!
Because Trump will be right
Trump wants a law that imprisons critics. Like Putin who uses the law as a veil. ‚ÄòCourse MBS and Kim and Duterte don‚Äôt bother with laws and he‚Äôd really like that.
Ok, time to follow this Cancer Survivor, Heart Transplant Survivor, Teacher of 40 years, Christian, Father, Grandfather, dog owner.  Hater of trump and all he stands for and all of his cronies. I will follow you back and support any worthwhile cause. Thank You
Trump's lies are way too  many to ever believe!
Trump would Welcome  Golden Showers
Trump Trump in November!
And no one to hold accountable... how about Trump, Barr, and Devoss and family for providing these thugs! These are the militia that will provide chaos for trump after the election promote civil war.
Trump is cleaning house and it is about time.
Illegal to Criticize Trump on Twitter???
Another lie by trump supporters
So Trump and Putin both Love the Saudis? That's a very strange Coalition isn't it?
Interestingly, I think the debates will not swing many votes at all this time around. I see Trump winning two of the three, mostly because Trump thinks faster than Biden.
Does that mean Trump put 40 million people back to work?
Because everything is his fault right? Lol delusional idiots. All the critics just know what the media lets you know but I‚Äôm sure you especially know it‚Äôs on Trump ü•¥ #Trump2020
Trump? Please explain intelligently and not just because you hate him
Mail-in voting has been done  for decades by some states, the military, and half the Trump administration.  Now Trump is losing popularity, so he‚Äôs yelling‚Äùrugged‚Äù &amp; going to screw up the postal service, for good measure. ü§¨
That‚Äôs required to be a Trump!
This is right from Trump's guidelines
You're right Josh, Why should some wannabe Special Ops sissy be allowed to even be in his position of power? Perhaps because Trump his leader is a Coward.
This picture of a Coward  pointing an assault rifle to threaten an unarmed protester. This should say everything about Trump's America. We can't allow a very weak minded Wannabe Dictator to decide our fate!
So we can thank white women for Trump?
What in the entire fuck? I'm sorry, but im over here trying to decide if I want to risk my kids lives to send them to school and these fuckwits are partying like Epstein and Trump. Too many underage people and no protection. #fuck2020
Trump Campaign approves
This type of reporting will only help the Trump campaign but the media is too ignorant or arrogant to see it.
I think a lot of politicians of all stripes are this way and Trump just amplified their behavior. We should demand better!
‚ÄúWe are not here being violent or being destructive. We have a positive message ‚Äî there is nothing to quell here,‚Äù she said, referencing Trump‚Äôs statement that the agents were there to quell unrest. ‚ÄúThe people of Portland are saying,
Lemme guess, you gotta "establish dominance!" Over that nurse going to help the other person. Witness Trump's politicized, flawed simplistic model of deterrence executed by DHS toy soldiers doing his bidding against American citizens
Trump's followers have nothing to do with the KKK. Those are Dems
Rep. Val Demings: ‚ÄòTrump Is Doing Everything He Can To Instill Fear‚Äô | M...  via
Anyone supporting Trump is aiding the deaths of Americans all over the country. He‚Äôs very likely stealing/laundering campaign money and his ignorant followers still heap praise on the orange blob! Stuff it Suzy!
But you're cool with trump sending armed mercenaries to snatch people off the street in unmarked vans.  You're more full of crap than a 2 story outhouse.
‚ÄúProtesters‚Äù isn‚Äôt the same as agitators who intend damage. Conflating them is exactly what Trump is trying to achieve with his hot rhetoric. We can  discuss order when he acts lawfully. Invading cities without invitation and with  unidentifiable camouflaged actors isn‚Äôt lawful.
Vote Trump back in!!!  #trump2020
Nope that would be trump
How about we mobilize the National Guard to establish a chain of custody for mail in voting, since Trump usurped their responsibilities to protect their states. #DumpTrump
Trump is so out of touch reminds me of the Roman senators right before the fall of the Roman Empire. Let's hope trump falls and not America
Fuck this. Imagine if fucking Gene Simmons ran and everyone said ‚ÄúHis plan is clearly to split the white vote so Trump will win again‚Äù
All Trump‚Äôs acts are designed to make a decent person‚Äôs hurl but saying nothing to Putin about bounties on US soldier is the most treacherous.
Btw, Trump claims to be devout, but he‚Äôs been divorced how many times? He‚Äôs had affairs how many times? He‚Äôs said horrible things about people how many times?
To be fair, if we hold them to things they say and do this many years in the past, wouldn‚Äôt a video of Trump have him saying similar AND dancing next to Epstein? Just a thought.
I drive a delivery van for Amazon. Seen a few Biden signs in rural Ohio, too. Still mostly all Trump, though, including some setups that took some effort.
Yet, people crucified Obama when he‚Äôd hold, which in 8 years has already been more than doubled in frequency in 3.5 by Trump. I‚Äôd say his priorities are skewed.
Yes, you need a new address and YOU HAVE TO RE-REGISTER TO VOTE. In the middle of this level of crisis, do you think people are going to remember that? Let there be no mistake about it, Trump is sadistic and intends to be president for life.
Only the cult wants to continue with Trump in office.
We cannot afford to be complacent and bank on Trump losing. Everyone vote. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
If anyone tries to argue that Trump is a good business man, just remind them that he waited until just recently to wear a mask when he could‚Äôve just made MAGA masks at the beginning and profit off that from the very beginning. #TrumpIsUnfit
This is Trump trying to show us he is our Law and Order President. That used to mean KEEPING THE LAW.  Now its breaking the law.  People we need to rid ourselves of this.
The Republicans ruin the economy and the Democrats fix the mess they left. Obama cleaned up Bush‚Äôs and now Biden will clean up Trump‚Äôs if he wins the upcoming election. If we get four more years of Trump this country will be unrecognizable.
Every day I'm more sure that Trump DOESN'T want to be re-elected - read his tweets  &amp; evaluate his actions that go far beyond what the majority of Americans are accepting now! He's just enjoying bullying and throwing his "excessive" weight around - pushing people's anger buttons!
The problem is that even when Trump is gone... we still have all these morons in our society
Absolutely wasting their votes and worse, they help Trump
I‚Äôm just as not impressed as the fact that trump can do it üòÇ
Please know that trump supporters are ashamed to admit they support him so they don‚Äôt tell pollsters that they do We have to vote in November We can‚Äôt be complacent VOTE
Hope Barr &amp; Trump are proud!!
The Trump Campaign needs to hire  Seriously üòÇ
Oh BS....you guys are doing your usual promotion of ‚Äúconservative christian ( small c ) values‚Äù and Trump pandering. Pushing your affiliates to spread the gospel of gaslighting for Gid. ü§¨
We the People voted in Trump for the very reason that we saw where our future was going. Straight to Socialist hell.
They do have Epstein tapes blackmailing Chief Justice Roberts...  But Trump and DOJ know this.  They‚Äôll throw down the Trump card when it‚Äôs time.  It‚Äôs not that time.
The Democrats need to drive this message home again and again. Trump and the GOP are elitist and won‚Äôt lift a finger to help anyone who needs it while rushing to help all who don‚Äôt...after a healthy campaign donation.
If we re-elect Donald Trump, this kind of wanton authoritarianism will become the new normal.   #TrumpsAmerica
Yes Like anyone believing trump
You were born into a democracy &amp; Trump (btw you described him so accurately-add pompous)is trying to turn USA in to a monarchy. In one of his 1st speeches he said ONLY HE could make America great. So we are just worthless citizens?Read up on American Revolution! We the PEOPLE !!
Protecting property while destroying our sense of safety. Trump‚Äôs private army - go home. #PortlandUnderSiege #PortlandMoms #GoHomeFeds
Of course Trump can read! What kind of a ridiculous question is THAT?!
Im not holding my breath.  Funny how they moved so fast on everything anti-Trump, yet they‚Äôre slow walking EVERYTHING on the anti-Trump coup cabal.
Please let us know what you‚Äôre smoking. My God doesn‚Äôt like ugly and Trump speaks ugly more than anyone I‚Äôve seen.
Risking Teacher and students' lives is not an option in a raging Pandemic. Screw Trump's approval rating. His irresponsibility and total lack of leadership forced us into this paradox.
Xenia is Trump country, there is no room for Sleepy üò¥ Joe Biden here!! Xenia and Greene County is ready for more  #BuckeyeBattalion #LeadRight
If you weren‚Äôt such an inept, ineffective, spineless mayor, President Trump would not have had to send in Federal troops to protect facilities. If your Police Force couldn‚Äôt keep people safe, why didn‚Äôt you ask the Governor to support with the National Guard? You are weak!
If you appreciate Randy Rainbow and the success of the protest folks who are making great videos right now - you've got to try this one - the Founders Sing - on You Tube with superbly-produced song greats re-created for our abnormal times and Trump/GOP hypocracy (sp.?)RETWEET
She hasn‚Äôt told Trump what ‚Äúher state‚Äù needs yet.
I can't believe that taxpayers are paying for an illicit Trump quasi-military force to harass our civilians. This is 3rd World Authoritarian activity sanctioned by a Mentally Ill #IllegitimatePresident !
That looks about as real as Trump‚Äôs hair and skin color üòÇ
Heck, Trump doesn‚Äôt  either. His word salads are becoming Palin-level. üòú
About lost it when I read this! Trump is certifiable!!!
What a disappointment Lightfoot turned out to be. Talk tough (like Trump on the Apprentice) then wimp out at the first pushback.  Like Trump, Lightfoot will be a one-term officeholder.   And I thought she had a backbone - turns out it's made of jelly.
At this point I suspect that a McGrath win would point to a Biden win by at least 100,000 and she gets enough "meh" votes from people there just to get Trump out. Can't imagine any other wayThat is quite a hurdle to be sure. But they are handicapped by just tuning into Trump's suggested news. (I am trying to remain in the spirit of John Lewis &amp; refrain from harboring any hate for them in my heart). Actually it is more akin to fear.
This has Putin and Trump written all over it, probably something they discussed in that telephone call
Heir to Estee Lauder, Ronald Lauder gave $200,000 to the Trump 2020 Campaign. Just so you know where some of your money might be going. #WeWillVote
We should reach across the isle to Trump's supporters &amp; let them in on the cruel secret joke. He doesn't care about them, just their vote. They have no money, power, prestige or connections that are useful to him. Except for their vote, they don't count, he looks down on them
Trump's gonna be needing U-hauls services soon #WeWillVote

My idea of what Donald Trump driving would look like
Can you imagine the road rage with Donald Trump behind the wheel of a car?
He actually supports school districts adopting policies that give parents the choice of what they think is best to protect the health and safety of their kids and others in the community. Trump, meanwhile, wants them to march in like your supporters into a Tulsa rally.
Trump 2020 you human catheter
I love it. Trump threw out the bait and the lunatic liberals fell for it hook line and sinker. They say it‚Äôs SO unsafe to go out and vote so he says he‚Äôll delay it till it‚Äôs safe and all of a sudden NO NO NO you can‚Äôt do that.
Remember 4 years ago Donald Trump was saying the election system is rigged, well 4 years later saying it again.
I bet the Senate Bill has the $50 billion for the new FBI building in Washington DC next to Trump's Hotel in it.
Trump 2020 you human catheter
Woah gamer relax
Trump is a very dangerous threat to our nation, our values, our security, this impeached Presidents powers need to be removed immediately
Trump citing a bunch of articles about issues with mail ballots in the primaries, but none were about widespread fraud. It was about quickly counting them or voters being disenfranchised by their simple errors or by the postal system.
Donald Trump shall not tamper with We The People's right to vote #WeWillVote
Trump is unhinged, his campaign is in complete chaos mode right now. Trump is scared. #WeWillVote Trump is going to lose.
Trump doesn't care about anyone
No surprise here. How many millions of Americans were dumb enough to vote for Trump?
I new you liked trump
Of course!   It was the plan all along.    All they have done for 4 years is make a big mess and stand on sidelines blaming Trump for it while he cleans it up. Same thing with Portland.  Funny thing, they think we are so stupid we don‚Äôt remember.  BUT WE DO.
How about Trump?  Never mind, we don't even need to look that up.
Donald Trump wants attention to be diverted away from him announcing today the withdrawal of US Troops from Germany, so he tweets about delaying the election which we know he can't do. #WeWillVote
There was no evidence against him.  There will be no blue win in November! TRUMP 2020!!!!!
Correction: It will get worse. We are in a depression and a pandemic, and the Trump administration is acting like a kamikaze pilot with the US.
This is a clear act of malfeasance by Trump and Pompeo, a felony and an impeachable offense.  It is not a "joke" to perversely threaten to breach the US Constitution like it is some damn game of monopoly.

That's B's Trump had an office for this and disbanded it. He fired Dr who told him we weren't prepared for this and continually gives mis information, conspiracy theories and lies. Criminally negelegent homicide! Murderers all. So stupid they won't wear mask get sick and wonder!
American reaches 150k COVID death, jobsless claims are rising again, the economy shrunk by nearly a third through the most recently ended quarter, making this the worst recession since the Great Depression and Trump wants to keep America from voting.
It‚Äôs no coincidence that Trump would suggest we need to delay the election when it became official we‚Äôre in the recession coming off the worst economic quarter in our history and jobless claims again went up. It‚Äôs shameless.
lol at anyone who didn't think Trump would be craven and stupid enough to openly admit he might suspend the election
U.S. Postal Service Gets $10 Billion Coronavirus-Relief Loan.  This is a step in the right direction.
Yet dumbass Trump keeps lying. That MF needs to go!
Starting a new #me too movement.   TRUMP 2020. Trump Jr 2024
Same here. My fear is that what we are seeing now is going to be so much worse before November. Add mail in votes are going to not work because of the mail system that Trump has now violated. I can‚Äôt believe we as a country did not put more roadblocks up for someone this.
You‚Äôre so full of it. Anyone who votes for Trump supports racism. And racism needs thrown out of this country.
He can't. Wouldn't want to hurt his chance to build Trump tower Moscow.
I‚Äôm starting 2024 trump jr movement
MAGA Trump 2020 then Jr 2024
Mark, you must be living TRUMP COVID head. Dems are the ones working to ensure everyone who is eligible gets to VOTE.  Are doing TRUMP'S bidding of smearing DEMS.
No, you are giving Putin the opportunity to begin to move in. Traitorous Trump. üò°
Lol I think trump wants to institute Devine right monarchy guess we need something in the middle
Brutal but every word of it true. The play on Trump's 911 ad is a brilliant twist.
I feel the same way about Fauci. But it would be political suicide for Trump. Remember people like us who actually know what‚Äôs going on unfortunately are in the minority. It‚Äôs crazy but most people in Ohio think Mr. Magoo is doing a good job. They have frightened most of us
That is insane and dangerous. It is also scary that Trump and cult want to try and silence anyone who disagrees with them. That sounds suspiciously like an action from a dictatorship &amp; oligarchy
There is no way a failure to deliver an extension and stimulus bill is anything but a political disaster for Trump and McConnell and Trump seems to be going out of his way to make sure it is.
Maybe they are expecting Trump.
trump may not have learned his lesson, but I hope the voters of Maine have.  You're a trump stooge and I can't wait for you to lose your seat.
You can tell who the SS agents are; they are the only ones wearing a mask. Maybe if they see a #CV19 droplet headed for Trump they will jump in front of it protecting him.
So you lied and Trump kicked your ass. Got it.
Funny how The Daily Show and Trump Derangement Syndrome has the same initials TDS.
Trump didn‚Äôt talk to Putin about reports of Russian bounties to the Taliban on American troops, but since his most recent call he orders 12,000 American military personnel out of Germany.
It‚Äôs kind of hard not to view Trump‚Äôs appearance in TX today as a panic move that the state is in jeopardy. They had both Rick Perry and current DOE Sec write columns praising him on oil issues to run in TX papers today to go along with it.
For those 3, the only drink is üí©Trump's favorite of bleach .
Trump is getting worse and worse He NEEDS TO GO! VOTE!!!!  HIM!!!!  OUT!!!!
I agree...and he scares the hell out of them. When he came in months ago and said Trump was spied on they KNEW their gig was up
The only difference between Trump and most Republicans since Ike is Trump doesn‚Äôt know how to avoid sayin the quiet part out loud.
Trump against the World!!  Perfect image
Thank you, President Trump,  for lowering drug prices for me,  and other seniors, like me,  who can't afford all our  prescribed medications. I've been praying along time,  to God to help me.  May God protect you always
Mfw Trump tweets stupid shit
All three! Putin owns TRUMP.
Plus two active lawsuits. One by mom‚Äôs and the other by journalists. Trump, DHS and CBP will lose both. CBP likely to be held in contempt for disobeying Court on leaving journalists alone.
What part of crazy does the stupid minions of trump not understand? This is what they support. This is the savior  they fall on their knees and worship. They actually believe this shit! From Mitch on, their stupidty speaks volumes. This is the Republican party!
He needs to take Trump‚Äôs cognitive test, and I bet he fails it.
Besides Trump and Putin, who is saying it is false?
Trump promises made promises kept what other politicians do that most speak with a forked tongue
Smart MOVE. Republicans are going down with the TRUMP "Lolly Pop" ship.
So, you think TRUMP is representing your interest?  Why? Because he is a nice guy who cares about your problems?
You need to remove this. NYPD already explained it was the warrant division arresting someone with a warrant. After your so called hearing yesterday not allowing Barr to speak and the fact you won‚Äôt condemn riots you are handing Trump another 4 years.
He was treated terrible but as we can see with you it is typical!!  Dems sealed the deal yesterday!! Yep Trump 2020
Trump and Melania
Hey Bow Wow that means Trump is WAY ahead
Does a Trump pardon have to be public?  Could Barr already have a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù letter from Trump?
üëçThanks you hit upon my intuitive reaction. HCQ simply cannot work in this politicize atmosphere because Trump recommended it. That is definitely a big part of what‚Äôs going on
With Trump and Barr repeating that mail-in voting is unsafe/fraud, and that foreign countries will interfere, can they be planning to have the Russians flood the US mail system with false ballots in swing states?  The purpose being to keep real ballots from timely arrival?
I envy Michigan. Ohio is bombarded with  end of the world ads on a daily basis. And too close to KY so we see  even darker view of the future. #voteBlue
Trump has asked at least three countries that we know of for help in getting him re-elected. Where are the DOJ investigations?
Why do you continue this lie. No we don't have enough to face what dumbass created. Ignoring a pandemic has led us to some stupid crap. Florida screwed by a trump puppet. Trump demanding schools open while his son sits in our house, his school isn't opening. Really?
It‚Äôll be interesting to see what excuse the Dems concoct to prevent any debates. There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd let Biden go head to head with Trump.
$0 for the USPS, state or local governments. No extension of student loan debt relief. No extension of food assistance. Cuts unemployment benefits. But does spend money on more fighter jets that Trump diverted to build is wobbly wall. This is GOP‚Äôs starting offer.
Donald Trump says we have record job numbers, yeah  we have record numbers of unemployed people
Donald Trump lied about his campaign slogan, MAGA really stands for Mace And Gas America
If you ever needed an example of rigid ideology making a group oblivious to their best interest. On purely political terms, it‚Äôs McConnell and Trump that needs to quickly get a successful and robust stimulus approved now. And Pelosi gave them the opportunity back in May.
If Donald Trump could have it his way this would be our reality, I'm glad we don't have a dictatorship here.
OR....they are setting up a safety net for rigging the returns.   I personally think that‚Äôs what they are doing.   So when trump tries to stand up for us and say there is no way this is correct, they will drag this back out and say ‚Äútold you he wouldn‚Äôt leave‚Äù
A Trump second term brought to you by the Pennsylvania fracking industry and Floridaians who love low taxes.
Move the protests a block away from the federal court house. Don‚Äôt give Trump what he wants by engaging the DHS cops. The fights are what gives Trump his ability to put Fed cops in other cities. Don‚Äôt work as unpaid extras to Trump‚Äôs reality show.
We need to convince the protestors to move the protest a block away from the federal court house. The fight is exactly what Trump wants so he can send disruptive troops into other cities. If there are Trump personnel in the protestors stirring up trouble, this will show them.
Yes but as soon as lobbyists get ahold of them, they flip to swamp monster.   At least that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening for decades upon decades.  Til trump because he‚Äôs not swayed by money and power.
In today‚Äôs WH briefing achieved only two things: - Confirmed Trump‚Äôs petty jealousy of the respect Dr. Fauci receives. - He thinks demon sex/alien DNA Doctor is credible.   God, makes the WH staff and  miss the days when he advocated ingesting disinfectant.
Barr is right up there with him. And Putin is giving Trump lessons in how to topple a democracy. That's why Trump talks to him in secret with no notetaker.
I'd be willing to trade the next stimulus check for Donald Trump to hand in his resignation
Trump just tweeted that prescription cost came down from last year. That's an outright lie. At least four of my medication prizes rose significantly. One of them quadrupled since December of 2019. I have the same insurance &amp; it was exactly the same medication.
Someone please explain why you have 5pm briefings instead of 4pm. ANTI Trump  bashes the Pres and you preempt  which is pro Trump??? Stepping on your own toes.
Our economy has not adapted to the needs of parents dealing with kids in partial or full virtual enrollment with only a months notice. Columbus is too busy trying to paper over its latest scandal and Trump is.... Trump.
We shut down in March and April to flatten the curve to buy authorities time to prepare and mobilize, Trump instead largely ignored the problem. Parents waited for authorities to get command of the situation over the summer. Trump golfed instead and tried to hold rallies.
While I hope you are right, after listening to Barr today say repeatedly that both Obama and Biden illegally spied on Trump, I can‚Äôt agree. An indictment only requires a grand jury to believe there is probable cause, unlike the proof required at a trial.
Please Sarah, be careful. The Trump haters will do anything or say anything to destroy this woman because they simply cannot allow her to be correct.
Barr is going to indict both Obama and Biden before the election. Not even hiding it. Barr and Jordan said it multiple times today that Obama and Barr illegally spyed on Trump.  Charges won‚Äôt hold but could have a serious impact on the election.
Because the R‚Äôs are getting rich from being a ‚Äúpublic servants‚Äùtoo!!   I have to use quotes because they seem to only serve themselves and make decisions accordingly.   I fear this country is through after Trump üòû
Trump is dragging his left foot. A sign of having had a stroke.
The truth is....these sick fks will kill people to make trump look bad and  bully us into submissionü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I said you can stop calling yourself a progressive because you said you were voting for Trump. I agree, you‚Äôre mental disconnect is uncanny.
Why are the fed troops dressed as military? Why aren't they clearly identified? Why would you dismiss a case when defendant has pleaded guilty? Stone was pardoned for his silence, as proven by stone &amp; Trump's public statements Do you have evidence that proves otherwise?
Lawsuit alleges Trump campaign, fundraising committee shielded millions in payments - The Washington Post
The protestors need to recognize that their protesting at the Federal Court House gives Trump a gift and allows Trump to send troops to Portland. If they would protest even a block from the Federal property they would deny Trump his opportunity. Shooting themselves in their foot.
Be cool if Trump could take 10 seconds from his busy day of nonsense tweeting to join our gif thread
I didn‚Äôt know Trump was a virologist, scientist, doctor. I mean how else would psychos blame him when he was following advice from actual alleged ‚Äúexperts‚Äù.
Now  cult is whining  is suppressing  "freedom of speech"  Does that mean we can go onto Trump properties and tell everyone what idiots the Trumps are? I mean if Twitter has to follow 1A, shouldn't all businesses?
You actually  admit trump had a great economy before being wrecked by COVID? Omg.... it‚Äôs a fkng miracle ü§£ü§£HOMEWORK JOHNNY, HOMEWORK! üòÜü§≠
Trump's health care plan is due in three days, on Friday, 7/31/20. Does ANYONE actually believe Trump and the GOP have a health care plan?  It is just another Trump and GOP lie.  One of a million lies. #TrumpMillionLies
Curious how this shows a much closer race in FL than other poll. Also shows Trump leading, but within the MoE in OH.
please focus on the post office issue. Focusing on telling protesters to move away from the federal buildings and still protest. That way tRump cannot send in federal troops. Telling people to vote is one thing but if the postal service is compromised....
These folks who are doing the damage are paid for by the tRump administration. We all know what you are doing. Too bad you weren‚Äôt as focused on the 150,000 deaths from COVID-19
And the ones causing the damage are paid for by the tRump administration
Someone please advise the protesters to move away from the federal property and go back like a block or so away. Then tRump has nothing and federal troops have nothing. Just do it. Those left who are causing the damage are not part of the original protesting.
Naw I prefer Trump gate. It's the continuing saga of illness and death. Close to 1 hundred and 50 thousand and rising. The drama filled with Trump's misinformation and lies. Best episode was the injection of bleach and ultraviolet light up the rear-end. Compelling B's.
And unfortunately the protestors are unpaid extras. Wish they would move their protest one block away from the federal court house and deny Trump what he wants.
Opinion | Trump‚Äôs articles of impeachment ‚Äî updated
Russian/Trump trolls out in force tonight. I'm trying to figure out how it says they've been on twitter since 2011 but have 40 followers. Twitter stop this.
Where's Nancy Pelosi? Impeach Barr Who are those from HHS Did Trump hire the Proud Boys? Waiting until Nov3 is not an option we're under attack #WakeUpAmerica #PelosiDoYourJob  Portland etc Matt Gaetz Bounty on our troops Emoluments Clause  Its not the Lincoln Project job
Really clever chess move by GOP, massive property development to help a Trump property and funding for more fighter jets beyond the defense bill they just passed while cutting unemployment
I am in a minority but do they really have to protest at the Federal court house that houses the Fed  ‚Äúofficers?‚Äù  It is obvious Trump wants the drama. If they would protest even a block away, then the Feds have no reason to attack the protestors. If they did, arrest the Feds.
Just Trump. He is utter convinced this is what businesses want.
Nothing better than to see Trump bitching about how he is mistreated.
Bet you lunch Trump won‚Äôt show or debate. He will demand conditions that will defeat the purpose of a debate; but in reality he knows he will look like an idiot next to Biden.
So, gonna be the name of the award Trump says he was awarded but declined now?
Folks, hug your kids. Tell them you will always love them. Or else they turn out like this:
This should be a huge story!!  The left will literally kill people to make trump look bad.   It‚Äôs OBSCENE!!!!
Hey,  can we talk about how Trump was so petty he lied about throwing out the first pitch at the Yankees and then tried to make himself look like a hero by ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù it before getting busted?
With all that is going on in this country, Trump was so jealous and petty over Dr. Fauci throwing out the first pitch at the Nationals game, that Trump made up he was going to throw one out at the Yankees home opener and then ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù it.
Hey Trump this is really really fucked up.
Trump is supposed to be the President of the United States and it says a lot about him that he doesn‚Äôt feel obligated to pay his respects in his official capacity to a long serving Member of Congress and Civil Rights icon. And we just are so numb we accept it as a new normal.
New tone last slightly longer the the new MLB season. Proof Trump has actually learned nothing:
Do they realize in a mortal kombat fight Joe would probably beat Trump‚Äôs ass??
Next time you wonder how Trump voters can be so easily duped but social media misinformation, go back and see how many people on the left fell for this and thought it was real.
