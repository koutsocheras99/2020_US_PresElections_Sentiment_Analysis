Because I‚Äôm not willing to risk another four years of trump for a political statement. At this moment in time a third party bid is simply unfeasible. No matter who wins, the democrats will lose voters en masse after this election. They need to pay for their transgressions
Thanks to Trump's blind, ignorant leadership.
üòÇü§£ Joe Biden and the Democrats have never cared about building in America and buying American. I guess President Trump showed you the error of your China ways. Joe just wants to raise or taxes and ban guns. No thanks! #TrumpPence2020
A huge issue that deserves more media attention. Repetitive news coverage about covid, BLM, Trump, major league baseball, etc really getting on my nerves.
There are few decent Repubs but not many. GOP Senate owns Trump's destruction of the country - covid, Justice Dept, stoking racial hate, financial corruption, foreign policy disasters, humiliation/embarrassment of our country. What did I miss?
If people think Trump didn‚Äôt this üò°
The amount of outright horseshittery bubbling up from the far left,lately,is starting to out stink that of the far right's. Covid19 isnt kicking OUR asses. Nor is TRUMP,or any other obstacle out there. The biggest ENEMIES to the #UnitedStates right now,are the 2 political sides.
Why do Americans have to remind the world why Trump was elected

Trump is a stupid man's idea of a smart man, a provincial's idea of a cosmopolitan, a poor man's idea of a rich man, the idiot who looks but never sees, who is given information but can't synthesize, attracting gullible bootlickers of the world. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpFailedAmerica

Christians,esp those who lean to the right,would do well to refamiliarize themselves with the sin of "PRIDE". You can not use the teachings of Jesus,to defend ppl like Donald Trump or Jerry Fallwell. It's a fool's errand,trying to,and only reveals a person who is confused,at best

Trump Interior Dept is dead set to make private profits via unsustainable plundering of Earth, our public lands. When  shits on  it is TrumpSwamp shitting on us all.
Poor Uncle Joe is just too old and is showing signs of dementia.  I hope the democrats will change directions and run a fiscally conservative democrat for president. This candidate would crush trump.
Yangs not wrong but this point exactly. Yang sold out too. Trump has destroyed what little idea was left of our country being a democracy. After 2020, I don‚Äôt see myself voting for the democrats again unless there is radical change within the party. Never republican again, either
IMHO, any Christian who believes solely on faith what Trump said about Biden and God today is violating at least two of the ten commandments and is tacitly accepting a false idol in place of God. The Word is clear that pretenders will come to fool the faithful for his own gain.
Did TicTok kill 158,000+ Americans in 5 months? I thought it was COVID.  Only a vain malignant narcissist who is afraid of what people online say about him would do what Trump did today when there are so many more-obvious dangers to American lives right now.

This is fine, but it's not that b/c Trump people won't get to see their grandkids for a few months - it's that, so far, 160k people will never see their grandkids again, ever (or their siblings, parents, or children)  And if Trump is reelected, that number will be larger.

He's talking about trump, right?
So let‚Äôs summarize this absurd argument using the facts. Virus spawns from Wuhan, China. Spreads to the rest of the globe with devastation causing a global pandemic and detriment to mankind. Your conclusion: TRUMP!! (Orange man bad). Yeah that ain‚Äôt gonna hold come November lol.
Neither. No one is happy about Trump officials using personal email. Some of us strongly support IGs, OGE, and external watchdogs like  who investigate and take action on these matters, and speak out ourselves.  Being anti-HRC doesn't mean someone is pro-Trump.
His war will never end. It will continue, unabated, forever.  Look to Joe Arpaio as an example of what Trump will do after he leaves office.
This is President Donald Trump‚Äôs Corona Virus plan.  Seriously.  This is his plan.
Honestly fuck the Democratic and Republican party‚Äôs that gave us a choice between Clinton and Trump.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
damn bro trump really out here killing mexicans
Trump touts fudged numbers as a success. It illustrates his failure.  The sooner the public withdraws their support, the sooner Congress can bypass him  But Republicans are cowards and would rather risk your life than admit they were wrong.  Fuck them. Protect yourself. #VoteBlue
Trump likes to talk about this pandemic in militaristic terms: He even said today that doctors and nurses were like soldiers running into battle.  I‚Äôll bite: that means they are ‚Äúprovid[ing] for the common defense.‚Äù
Many people predicted America under a Trump presidency would amplify authoritarian voices. Voices like the one Tom Cotton used in the NYT op-ed.  But it isn‚Äôt new. The assault has been in progress for decades. Reversal of American progress was already in motion when Trump came.
*and in a spectacular example of pure journalistic excellence, he brought items to the interview to debunk many of the expected talking points Trump uses, and they came in handy. Journalism textbooks should talk about this interview for generations.
Post-pandemic 2021 fantasies:  After Trump is indicted and convicted on money laundering and fraud charges, all of his hotels should be seized by state authorities and turned into public housing.
Remember: Trump is less popular now than he was on November 8th, 2016, and on that date it took a mere 70,000 people in three states to swing the electoral college his way. Don‚Äôt let your guard down, continue to resist, keep your efforts up, and we will defeat him.
Pro tip: When Trump says ‚ÄúMany people are saying‚Ä¶‚Äù but does not get specific about which people, he is about to lie to you. 100% of the time, what follows next from his lips will be a bald-faced lie.  proved that basic follow-up questions easily dismantle the lies.
The Trump administration is complicit in an attack on our election infrastructure and discourse because they know it is happening to help him win. Nevermind that this will irreparably damage American democracy and erode election confidence for a generation. Crickets from the GOP.

Trump should throw a party for everyone he retweets. It would be hysterical to see him trapped in a room with all these low-life people he would never associate with in his personal life.
No it‚Äôs not. We are PROUD of our President, or at least we should be. We needed someone like President Trump to finally put a foot down and take control of the corrupt deep state.

Next she'll blame her lack of sex with Barack on Trump when the truth is she is just to manly for his taste anymore.....!!
Stevens has not followed by anyone I‚Äôm following so I don‚Äôt see him as a conservative. That would explain his selection. No Mike Pence would not make a good president either we need a roaring lion like trump someone who will reach across the aisle and bitch slap a democrat.
trump only cares about the military when he can use them as a prop in his bid for more power. Individual soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines? He has no use for them.
And a man calling a woman a "nasty" name is very uncool. Actually, it is uncool for anyone to do it to anyone.  But let me guess, you are a Trump supporter, Am I close?

TDS is rather like telling an abused woman it's HER problem, not the guy smacking the crap out of her. Trump shows us exactly who he is, you are like those who imagine the emperor is wearing beautiful clothes. As for Jesus, he and I are on good terms, thank you.
And about Joe, you guys are the sick ones in your interpretations. Unlike Trump, it is not all about sex. He has a long history of compassion and caring, what this country needs right now.
But thank you for showing me how the Trump Christians were spinning his comments about the woman. That is a good one, he was just extending his Jesus like good will to all sinners. Yeah, right.
Oh plezzzz that is straight from the GOP playbook.  And Trump is a Christian? Really?  A man who has publicly claimed he does NOT believe in asking for forgiveness and won't.  He says ugly things about strong women all the time, but the woman who is a sex trafficker?

And I will add, YOUR president publicly gave good wishes to a woman who is at the center of a child sex ring. A woman who groomed children for sex. A woman who Trump partied with. So please, spare me your faux outrage.

First, Biden has been dealing with stuttering his entire life. Second, Trump supporters look utterly ridiculous and clueless when they post these types of Biden posts.
You people are ridiculous. Trump has broken several laws and nothing from the GOP. Barr is as corrupt as they come and nothing from the GOP. Yet you insist on beating a dead horse when it comes to anything Comey. Your priorities are totally screwed up!
Good observation, and it only took 20 years. Imagine how terrifying the next 20 years will be if we don‚Äôt keep Trump types in office.

This is disgraceful. It makes me ashamed to live in a State that would even consider voting for this racist criminal. Between Trump and Arpaio it's hard to tell which is the biggest racist üêñ! Unbelievable! What has become of America? Hatred &amp; racism has taken over.
Contrary to their claim,  clearly explains why Trump is correct in predicting voting by mail would be a train wreck.
(2) whenever asked what can be done by Congress to stop them there is NEVER an answer! I have 1 thing that might give them reason to pause. Defund the DOJ, and any project Trump wants money for. Congress controls the purse strings. Start holding back $$$.

I'm a contractor. Us contractors have always known Trump screws people over. Trump won the election on one thing.. "you're not voting for me, you're voting against her". He's doing it again
I‚Äôll say this. I‚Äôm a contractor. Us contractors have know about Trump screwing over contractors since 80‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt trust the guy. Only way he got votes to win is cause he gave people a choice that was deceiving. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not voting for me, you‚Äôre voting against her‚Äù.. chew on that
Only part about Trump that‚Äôs not the same rules as any other President is that he called out on national tv for America‚Äôs long lived enemy, Russia, to find dirt on his opponent. That‚Äôs crossing the line! That‚Äôs practically asking an enemy nation to get involved in our election..

My only concern is a trump victory and a Republican Senate majority for four more years. In that time, he could destroy the Republic. Between now and January? You‚Äôre right, the odds are so small as to be unworthy of attention. Eye on the prize. Vote for Biden.
Just a spam of these accusations now. Too bad a Trump nomination had to be the popular event for this evil.   Had it been someone else perhaps good takes could have been had before solidifying some kind of listen and take as fact attitude.   How long until the humans shed this?

Trump is egotistical and should stay quiet much of the time, but his policies are on point to get people to work, can think freely and is a patriotic President, unlike the 8 years prior. I don‚Äôt care for Trump the person but I like his platform.

I called that as soon as the debates were scheduled. Biden can‚Äôt free think any longer. He‚Äôs a full blown dementia patient and his VP pick is who the Dems want as President. Biden would be a drooling idiot on any debate stage. He will NEVER debate, let alone debate Trump.

Should have used Trump‚Äôs line, ‚ÄúI take no responsibility.‚Äù In the ad. He takes no responsibility, becuz he shovels everything off to Jared to take the blame. Not just becuz he f*ks everything up.
Trump is no longer ‚Äòloved nor feared‚Äô ‚Äî he‚Äôs just become a ‚Äòjoke‚Äô: conservative -
WATCH: Trump‚Äôs repeated claims about ‚Äòhoaxes‚Äô thrown back in his face in new ad -  This is why he's horrible. If it's a hoax, he doesn't make anything better! Vote him out!
Kanye is a shill and diversion and being abused by tRump. Pathetic. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
As a Catholic supporter of President Trump I agree with him that Biden does not defend his faith by his actions He supports abortion euthanasia and Planned Parenthood against his faith
This article distresses me deeply Our bishops are appointed by the Vatican to teach us about our faith NOT to be shills for the Democratic party!
Does anyone remember Bishop Stowe reprimanding Obama for separating children from their parents at the American border? I don't either. The basis for him calling #Trump anti-pro-life
Who could possibly believe that Joe Biden doesn't believe in God or that Donald Trump does!
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vs. St. Damien: The Deeper Issue -    How many American Catholic Democrat Bishops would have written this article?  Instead they promote pro-abortion Catholic Democrats and vilify Trump
Bishop Stowe accuses Trump of being "anti-pro-life" but says nothing at all about Biden being pro-abortion that is even more anti-pro-life Democrat bias?
Another failed rally sponsored by Trump
When it comes to military options, I'm VERY glad Trump is not predictable. Our President is not a "yes" man!
tRump is desperate. #LiarInChief  #GoJoe #VoteTrumpOut
Let's see what a Democrat psychologist ER doctor says about Trump's well-being!
It's another narcissistic injury, stuck in his craw.  He also has more posturing to do before November. And so it is, and so America just... blows my mind.   Trump Targets WeChat and TikTok, in Sharp Escalation With China
McConnell you old man...the dems are holding firm to give actual help to americans. But yeah...sit back in your mansion with a fridge full of food and tell us more how you know about struggle. You are a lier and suck up to trump.
WTF? Trump says, and so it is?  Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok, WeChat
You are so obsessed with Obama it's ridiculous! I believe it's also rude for you to say got Obama doesn't care about black lives. If your family loves you they will take you in for a full mental health evaluation. You are unwell Trump mentally unwell.
Trump, are you the false prophet

Never did like Trump.  But, that statement just killed any chance of a vote from me. Oh, waitaminnit, I wasn't gonna vote for him anyway! üòÑ
Untrue statement!  They Never had it snatched by Joe Biden, Trump already did this with his Ridiculous talk of "My Black Person'!
He doesn't want to win, he wants to help Trump win!
Ummm Alamo? Thighland yo semits....trump needs to go back to elementary school.
trump puts hiself and Russia fist. Biden puts America first. GOP have sold their souls to trump. Sad.
LoL! Trump can sure twist your nipples. He spins you off in every direction, out of control. Fun to watch you spin...
are they trying to get Trump 100% of the votes.
... going .... going ... GONE !     Trump says Biden disparaged, insulted Black community in latest interview |
I agree, responding to Trump is like fodder to him. If Biden wants to speak about his faith, it should be on his terms.
Trump is a Disgraceful and dishonest President and man.  Need i say more?
Such an Untrue statement!  Disgraceful that  would allow Trump to put this out!  They are just as Devious it seems!
I hope you are not going to make the decision to support Donald Trump. He will not get reelected because he's failed at being the President. Be smart and stay away from him. He will go to jail.
A Ridiculous untrue statement by Trump!
She was placed into her position By  .  She was in politics before this, but has always Voted with the Republican Party and Trump.
Between their Lies and their actions I'm dismayed.  Trump &amp; the Entire Republican Party need to be dismissed for the good of the country.  After they're gone they should start a better Part that actually has Morals and ethics.
Yes, Trump is dumping Our money into the Stock Market and the only problem is Not all of us have Stock!  The Rich get Richer!

Ouch. It is what it is. Trump is a psychopath. By his own mouth he has no compassion for people.In other news, trump will be issuing an EO ordering that it shall be light outside during daytime hours, and dark at night. Another EO coming down the pipeline, ice shall be, as the president called it, "cold".
And indictment, and conviction, and of course a trump pardon.

Being born into money doesn't make one cosmopolitan either. You are a racist too . Everytime Trump has said something racist you've retweeted or emphatically agreed with it.  And that's on the side of you actually hating minorities as well. Go back to jail.
Did you miss it when I said I'm not in line to vote for Biden or Trump?
And you tell me what point would it serve to write a book about Trump being a racist when he wasn't running for president in 1989?
You asked me to list the things he's said that was racist. In essence , you are no different than he is. So tired of this shit.
I'm not planning to vote for Biden but maybe you can tell me since you are a die hard Trump supporter why aftr I mailed off my daughters' and my mail in applications I started getting a mails from the Trump Administration offering me free accomodations to his rally for donations
What you need to do is wake up and understand that Trump isn't someone who loves minorities. He never has. You've even ignored the fact that he kept blacks from renting from him in 72. He has told people he'd never trust a black to count his money.
You probably don't think they're racist because you think the same way. Trump has called for 4 women of color to go back to their countries. 3 are from America and one came here as a child refugee from Somalia. That's racist.   In 72 he was sued for housing discrimination.
Exactly. At least we call him out. Trump says something racist and  turns his nose up like he didn't hear it I doesn't care.
If you had read the article instead of just the damned title ...  Also...I take issue with Biden saying "if you don't vote for me you ain't black" ... But you sit there talking about how Trump isn't a racist and people are making accusations against him up. Trump hates minorites
Trump has been racist and open about it for the past 50 years and you're acting as though he was just born and is perfect . You have issues . Your biases speak volumes.
Yep Biden said that bullshit and Trump around the same time was in deep shit for discrimination against black renters.  He told someone that he'd never let a black count his money.  But you keep telling uneven stories.
Ive already been banned! I made the same comment as someone else. Wanna know the difference? I support Trump and them Biden!
1.8millions jobs created DURING a pandemic, 9 million in a total of 3 months! someone tell me again how POTUS is ruining our economy? all i read are good things even during a pandemic! Trump did that! #trump2020

I CANNOT GET THE CRIES OF THAT CHILD SCREAMING FOR HER MOM OUT OF MY HEAD AND HEART...... there were 3 humans and a WOMAN (officers) who couldn‚Äôt help that poor baby??? Did Trump shrivel our hearts so much that we don‚Äôt have one anymore? Vampires is what we have become
Do you really think anyone but MAGA believe you? 160,000 dead. You should have removed Trump. Instead you enable him &amp; endanger our democracy. But then that's what you, the Koch's &amp; your Russian handlers have wanted all along. You truly are the Grim Reaper of  death &amp; sorrow.
This guy will soon be a high ranking official, either in the WH or the trump campaign. Replacing whoever quits/gets fired next.
The Marxist socialist Democrats I pulled out all the stops because they do not want President Trump elected for a second term the Deep State know there will be in deep trouble all the crooked cops in the FBI and politicians will be exposed that's why they're fighting so hard
He just didn‚Äôt want to meet up with Trump!
In 2016 NRA contributed $30M to Trump's campaign. They were a major player in his election. They &amp; Trump will visciously attack AG NY over civil suit to dissolve them. I suspect Trump will again incite violence claiming it's a move by Dems to strip 2A rights. Wish they'd waited.
That you're a troll. Trump is an immoral huckster who will say anything to be reelected. He'd never been in a church until he needed the Evangelical &amp; fundamentalist Christian vote. Just another smoke &amp; mirrors con. Ex: Didn't know books of bible &amp; photo op w bible inverted.

She‚Äôll complain about trump but it‚Äôs only because of how he treated her father, not his politics.   I think her mother has come out for Biden.
The ads are already on my nerves and  it‚Äôs only going to get worse. The trump ad with someone breaking into a house &amp; police message saying they aren‚Äôt coming is particularly offensive.  Biden has never called for defunding the police.
His comments convert the cost of the entire trip to taxpayer. He's saying it's part of presidential duties rather than campaign funded.  The level of Trump presidency corruption is unprecedented. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
You so full of it you think trump even like him pr the republicans  there just using him you think they would even let it go as far as you people think it would  HES BEING USED I  to like him and Kim and her family but this is just bull they lost a fan and I will spread it
They won't care. Trump will tell MAGA it does.

156,000 deaths. More than Korea, Vietnam &amp; all middle east wars combined. And how much tax money did Trump spend on ineffective Hydroxychloroquine? So much that he 'donated' 2 million doses of useless COVID-19 drug to Brazil.
Like Trump hospitalizations &amp; deaths need to be evaluated on a per capita basis. What's not understood are long term costs of disease. But to me - I don't value life the way for profit insurers, providers &amp; government do. every one is precious.
Now would be the time for feds to step in. But they won't. Trump &amp; GOP want the virus to spread &amp; kill as only top 5% could possibly afford. The vaccination should be free to Americans just like polio 50+ years ago.

Of course, Zuckerberg's FaceBook is a Trump propaganda media outlet. They refuse to mark or delete Trump lies.
All reasons  shouldn't stoop to Trump's level. No need for debates. The debates lend credibility to him.
They know nothing that President Trump did wrong it was trying to find something they wasted three years millions of dollars and found nothing and then all the information right in front of them about the Obama Administration and all the dirty cops and did nothing
Exactly and President Trump's approval rating would be through the roof but that's if we had reporters that reported the news and not propaganda
We're all in for President Trump
Yeah we developed with our tax dollars they sell to other countries for a dollar a pill and make our pay $50 a pill stop all that and president Donald Trump will do it

In a few weeks look for a steep rise in cases, hospitalizations &amp; deaths. GOP governors don't care. They've adopted Trump's "It is what it is."
Trump who held the Bible upside down for a photo-op during a Trump induced violent attack on peaceful protestors is considered religious by Evangelicals. Christians waited 2,000 yrs for the second coming and then voted for the Anti-Christ.
they are silent because there is nothing to say! he was never there no proof. Trump actually kicked Epstein out and cut ties a while ago BEFORE Elsteins first conviction. all trhese other asshats WHO CONTROL MSM coverage have been seen there.
Philosophically, I would be open to a viable 3rd party candidate. Realistically, a trump win could mean the end of everything you've been talking about. Biden wasn't my first choice, nor 2nd or 3rd. But if he loses, trump wins. That's reality.
That's what she's depressed about Law &amp; Order is uncovering all the illegal thing still Obama administration have been doing they are so corrupt the Deep state is trying to cover for them when President Trump wins re-election it will all come out
If you see a moral equivalence between voting for trump and voting for Biden, then there's no point in any further discussion. If trump wins, it'll be because of people that think like you. And then it won't matter. Have a good day

This tells you how ignorant and incompetent Trump is, or pleading ü•∫ being a dummy..
How bout this? We're stuck with an asshole that has filled his admin with people dedicated to destroying the dept's they run Biden, if he is declining (he isn't), will be surrounded by people who know what they're doing A vote for anyone but Biden, or no vote, is a vote for trump
That's where the focus of the grand jury's and investigation should be on re President Trump alone he hasn't done anything wrong he's been fighting for America
Stein had policies but no integrity. She was applaided by Putin. So tear him apart. But  shouldn't give him credibility with  debates. But then Joe shouldn't debate the sociopath Trump either.
Discrediting Kanye as a Trump Trojan horse is worth exposing. The last thing we need is an inexperienced egotistical tv reality "star". This isn't The Apprentice.
Trump's Republican party sucks. Disliking Trump yet doing nothing to clean the entire GOP is cowardly.
I follow only to hear more spiteful dangerous lies &amp; the latest Trump apologist propaganda. #TrumpHasNoCredibility
Uses Trump excuse pattern as his not responding to Putin's bounty on American soldiers in Afghanistan.  He still hasn't acted. Cruelty and denial are the point.
Don't drop to Trump's level. Don't debate. There's no gain.  MAGA will never be converted despite Trump's obvious immoral character flaws, racism, bigotry, hate cult, purposeful cruelty, sociopathy &amp; incompetence. Listing &amp; showing Trump's faults are too long.
Absolutely. I've already tweeted as much tagging  Trump will lie &amp; bully as he did Hillary. Joe has more to lose than gain when debating a lying sociopath whose only skill is self promotion. Not a single Republican or MAGA Cult will be converted. #NoDebates #DontDoItJoe
There were hundreds more TRUMP flotilla boats on parade last weekend!
Good job Martha!  Keep up the good work!  If we can get back the house and keep Pres Trump maybe we can MAGA!  Trump just about had it done before the virus but he can do it again if we can give him enough good help (like you)!
I‚Äôve been here since 1999 and I‚Äôve seen more racism from that sherif and the former governor Brewer. Trump pardoned him. He‚Äôs a really bad guy. He‚Äôs also a criminal.  He‚Äôs got a base here because of his hate.
Who paid for those millions of doses? If so, did the purchase go through required purchasing process? Does Trump have a personal financial interest in the manufacturer? Who else does?
Trump 2020!
No need to apologize, Trump made 1,000 mistakes
They do not want to save lives that's why they're against it if President Trump had to mention that they would love that drug because you messed it there never trumper's they rather see Americans died and give President Trump a win
Which Trump, of course, repeated during presser. They want war. It's an effective Trump distraction from his  election fraud &amp; fits Putin narrative.
Trying to watch today's presser by Trump. It's sickening. One example: sales of used cars are up increasing their price is good for motor city. But hey, corona virus cases have stabilized in Miami. Ugh. I just can't. I'll wait for   &amp;  commentary.
The destruction of our country has always been the go of Trump &amp; GOP.
When are we going to storm WH? Trump's walling in the People's House needs to be challenged. And the Capitol GOP leadership offices as well.
Trump &amp; GOP are Fascists. We must overwhelm &amp; destroy them at the polls. Else our elections are now only for show.
need to put out ads of Trump efforts to gut Social Security &amp; Medicare. Ending these taxes will lead to shorterm funding shortfalls. GOP will steal our Earned Benefits many seniors rely upon. Appeal to financial insecurity.
No. It's a common 'notion' among Republican politicians who don't care about  devastation &amp; deaths. They should to look to the resurgence of Covid hotspots in other countries that opened schools too early. An example even Trump &amp; Kushner might believe is Israel's experience.
Yeah they've tried every other way so they had to go this route so sad that they would ruin the country just to try to ruin President Trump's chances of re-election
Trump is an embarrassment to this country
Sometimes I really think I am in an echo chamber, filling my social media feeds with like minded people. Then I read comments from Trump supporters and realize, I can't handle that much stupid in my life right now.
McConnell Barr and Trump in that order. Horrible human beings.
Exactly President Trump isn't a politician but he tells you how much he loves America all these politicians make excuses for America for what reason I do not know except to appease the dictators
Creepy Joe will never debate President Trump they won't let him
They will do every day make him not that have creepy Jo debate President Trump you'll see creepy Joe for what he is and they don't want that to happen go to get the Coronavirus stop it
OK - US has 4% of world's population and 25% of world's deaths - got it tRump?
Someone actually just replied to a comment I made and they said asymptomatic people cannot infect other people and that I should "stop spreading lies!" Lol!! For reference, their handle had Trump 2020.  Yep, that explains A LOT! üòÇ #Stupidity #Idiots #IgnoreScience
You are on fire! You are right on the money with Trump. Please continue to urge your younger followers to vote Biden.
You need to step up the pace if for some reason President Trump does not directed all this will be buried never see the light of day so everybody will got away with the all the dirty dealings of being a bad cop that lying to the fisa court
They don't care about that they want an election that's disruptive because they know President Trump is going to win by a landslide I may want a reason to cry foul
In President Trump second term I hope he has a spot for you to help drain the swamp
The never trumper's hate President Trump so bad they would rather have Americans die than get medicine
Yes indeed it's been safe for over 60 years show called medical professionals don't want you to take it and these so-called doctors of the fake news media because if it works it makes President Trump look good they don't want that they don't want you to get healthy
Let Trump, his entire family, cabinet, WH staff &amp; GOP lawmakers take it first. Better yet, add them to Stage 2 trials. Then infect them &amp; see what happens.
Counter Trump's lies by appealing to Americans' emotions We're all frightened of being sick &amp; poor with no income. Pivot to his plans to unilaterally gut (even eliminate) Soc Sec. &amp; Medicare. It will leave those 65+ destitute after paying in for their entire working lives.
Trump plans to use pandemic to unilaterally gut Soc Sec &amp; Medicare. GOP support him. 10s of millions rely on it for our retirement after paying into it for a lifetime.
This needs to be blasted across every network. Want Americans to reject Trump &amp; the entire GOP?  I've paid into Social Security &amp; Medicare my whole life. I need it. All older Americans do too.
While they're at it, how many GOP will be caught in the web.  I still wish NY hadn't given the Trump's a pass on their despicable Foundation fraud.  Shouldn't that also have been campaign financing fraud?
I think we should do the same thing to Trump supporters that Nazis did to Jews.
That‚Äôs a pathological liar for you. Trump falsifying data for his supporters..majority of us are well educated enough not to believe his BS..

That's why I don't find a reason not to debate President Trump
Yeah they talk like that to get elected and then they changed everything they do not hold their word President Trump when he says something he doesn't the Democrats give you lip service
And sadly so is Donald J Trump...some of us know who he really is Most don't
Trump doesn't want you to see his white hood.
Loved the TRUMP boat that passed in front of the SpaceX capsule splashdown!
That's why the Deep state is trying to check President Trump down he is for America and the American people not for the ruling class
There shouldn't be debates with Trump. He will lie, bully &amp; rely on blatantly racist remarks. There is no upside for Biden.
And look at the people Obama pardoned murderers pedophiles real criminals President Trump pardoned a couple people because the justice department treated them wrong with dirty cops and the doj set them up
The Marxist socialist Democrats want this to continue until the election they take it benefits them they don't care about the American public they would rather have our streets burn that have President Trump re-elected they are so sad Trump derangement syndrome
The Socialist Democrats all they want to do is penalized the American public make us hurt that you will turn on President Trump but we will not turn on our president he's trying to help us the Marxist socialist Democrats are trying to destroy America
Trump knows the higher the turnout, the worse he will lose. Simple as that. He's setting things up to say the election wasn't legit so he can refuse to leave. Fortunately, squatter's rights won't extend past 1/20/21.
Her choice. At any time she could &amp; should have spoken out. She never publicly intervened. Why did none of our taxpayer funded scientific &amp; medical experts speak out about crimes? Why not CDC or NIH? Instead they caved to Trump &amp; WH. What did McConnell &amp; GOP leadership know?
In a previous deposition, that young woman had stated she had seen trump at epstein's NY apartment, and that trump had flirted with her. She changed her story in the second deposition. She also stated that she was scared because there were a lot of powerful people invloved.
Since Trump wasn‚Äôt in politics back when he wouldn‚Äôt rent to black or brown people we have no quotes but plenty of litigation against him.
That‚Äôs what Trump is going to throw at people affected by the hurricane instead of paper towels.... cans of Goya beans
still not a word about these accusations on Bill Clinton. if it were Trump its all that would be trending!! your silence is deafening!!!!! #BillClintonIsAPedo  keep this tag trending! The Clintons are also HEAVILY involved with fucking Bidens campaign, contd
Ok bud when Trump is literally exposing everything. Y‚Äôall make no sense. Trump is the one stoping them.
Agreed. I'm not defending anyone that has done any of that kind of thing. He kept mentioning epstein, leaving trump out, and rolling clinton into that mess. Other than having spent time with epstein, no one has accused clinton. Victims have named epstein, maxwell, trump, etc
can't come even close to Trump's dark charisma and will get absolutely smashed in the suburbs, and the rust belt in general...hope he's the nomineeI can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.

Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...

You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.

What Country would want to make a deal when Trump has proven he‚Äôll reneg on a deal in a heartbeat?
As trump stated in a press conference the will be tax cuts, continued eviction ban, unemployment enhancement and the second round 1200 stimulus checks.
Another update in political news: NO deal was made by today (the dead line) between the democratics and republicans and now Trump is issuing an executive order for the stimulus packages.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Yes, it is ordained.  predicted way before he announce he was running that Trump would win two terms. Kim Clement is the real deal.
Thank you  .  Trump will shutdown the USPS or slow delivery to a crawl in October to frustrate mail ballots.  Or the ballots will simply "disappear."
# 1 President Trump has cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule. Regulatory costs have been slashed by nearly $50 billion &amp; have saved taxpayers $220 billion once actions are implemented. The deregulation efforts will save American households an estimated $3,100 per year.

Lol ikr, but I was never a fan of the Patriot Act.  Btw, where is this coming from that a company run by the Trump campaign used PII to influence the election? This is proved?   shouldn't that tweet be removed as misinformation according to your own policies?
Trump still has his witts about him. They‚Äôre gonna have to give Biden the debate questions in advance like they did Hillary.
It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.
Daniel, I love your reports on Trump, but can you PLEASE emphasize that he can't legislate by Executive Order? This stuff is Dead on Arrival if challenges are filed in court because the EO usurps the legislative function. Trump is using EOs as a dictator.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Informed Christians will vote for Trump. We don't want a theocracy. We just want our freedoms and Trump's policies are doing just that.

You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
He taught his kids the same criminal activity his father taught him. They've gotten away with it because no one has ever looked into it.  If Trump under valued property to pay less taxes, they did as well. If he overvalued to get loans, so did they.  It's a family crime syndicate
No.... Trump fucked kids with Epstein closer to home.  In Palm Beach and NYC.  Why would I care if Dems are guilty, too?  They should all swing, along with Trump.

My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?

Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.

No wonder he was never upset about Trump!
We are giving China a slow death by thousand cuts. Excellent strategy that can minimize our cost of war against the evil! Trump is our modern time dragon slayer!

Agreed he‚Äôs just as bad as Trump, besties with the Russians. #MitchMustGo
Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

I have a Parler account Sharon but to me it's dead over there ... and it's like preaching to the choir. Independents I'm trying to sway to Trump here...a Lib likely won't ever happen.
Actually I don't like Trump either lol try again
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Like everything else I guess  Trump turned opening schools political. But of course it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about safety and nothing more. I can‚Äôt imagine after is political. They are kids and teachers and staff and when we know it is safe they go back. Why is that an issue
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.
Imagine being so ignorant, and stupid that you think this is about Trump. It's about my country, Trump is just the person in charge right now.
He is as heartless as Trump
Please Read:
Gov. Cuomo, come fix Arizona.  Trump lies. Arizona is a hot spot. Our governor fought mayors over masks. He did not want masks.
What does that even mean?  You left the vast majority of your Twitter 280 unused in the process of posting a three-word tweet that is ambiguous at best.  Can you do ANYTHING besides bitch about Trump?
plus all preexisting conditions covered, which was dems central talking point for 3 years.
Says the Trump lackey who made Arizona a top pandemic spectacle from his lack of leadership when it counted. Come on Ducey, get out of the 8th floor and smell the wilting roses of our discontent.

I don't know why I'm playing dumb here. Donald Trump could roll out a verbatim copy of the Affordable Care Act and most of his supporters would gobble it up. A damned conservative think tank came up with the broad strokes of the thing.

KEEP TRUMP OUT
Trump loves Thigh land
I am convinced that the #Democrats plan has always been to inflict as much death, economic pain and chaos as is humanly possible, all in a singular attempt to defeat #Trump.
Yeah #Obama did that. First thing Obama did that #trump didn‚Äôt kill. Oh wait. He has been in court for 3+ years to kill #ACA which protects pre-existing conditions. #idiots.  I await your scathing response with baited breath üòÄ
Yep, and Trump is going to weaponize that report that came out tonight: ‚ÄúChina wants Biden, China wants Biden!‚Äù.
Definitely not, it's actually far worse. Start with over 160,000 dead due to Trump's inaction. Huge Federal debt, escalating crime against racial minorities, massive unemployment and reduced living conditions are just part of Trump's legacy
Is she Trump's personal physician, or even a physician at all?  What's your point in bringing her up, apart from a "sling all the mud you can at the wall, and hope some of it sticks" tactic as part of trying to divert every discussion into a referendum on Trump personally?
I wish people would stop telling me to vote for Biden just because they don't want Trump to win, that's not going to make me want to vote for the 1st time. I get it but Biden really ain't shit either
so wait Trump's press conference was to announce that he's signing an executive order to guarantee something that the affordable care act already guarantees? what?
Anyone who claims they are against the Left and doesn't vote for Trump, they themselves are on the left.
No vaccine with my name on it. Trusting God's plan.

(2) And it's absolutely arbitrary and self-serving to re-write rules of medical ethics about long-distance diagnoses of non-patients based only on media observations because "Trump has enablers" (as if Biden DOESN'T! üôÑ).  That doctor -- if indeed he is one -- should know better.

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
If President Trump leaves Twitter so do I.
Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
I didn't hate Obama. I strongly disagreed with everything he stands for.  The Left? They HATE Trump. They Hate him.   Trump was elected by a little more than a quarter of eligible voters.  Assuming half eligible voters are Republican WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER in November.
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
He just had his head inflated by the trump admin. Don‚Äôt you know he‚Äôs a model governor now?! Lmaoooo üòÇ

You work for this guy?
Looks like we have Kanye Trump or maybe Donald West (aka  ) oooh, I like donald west, running for prez in wisconsin! What a bunch of crap.
Exactly. Cooper feigns concern and like you said, is trying to pin it on Trump.
Should he hold campaign events that get people killed instead like Trump does? Herman Cain is dead. Don't know if you heard that, John.
You're obviously a Romanian troll for Trump so this conversation is over. Again, have a lovely evening.
You wanted the states to handle it so they did. Don‚Äôt blame trump for 160k dead
So many of you hate Trump because you say he is racist but this clown gets a pass? If we are being honest I have seen far more racist words and actions from Joe. C'mon man Biden
Trump says he may take executive action on evictions, student loans, payroll taxes if no aid agreement reached
I accidentally bought one that said something about Trump on it but I can't find the packaging right now
Legal challenges to come.... But Trump doesn't care since it's just a campaign thing

‚Äúare poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states‚Äù is a spot on description of Trump supporters.
Trump is simply simple and pathetic.
LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Yeah, I wouldn't believe Trump even if he told me it was raining while he was standing outside in a hurricane!
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
Trump is corrupt. Calling his event at his Bedminster Golf Club a ‚ÄòPress Conference‚Äô so the event would be paid by the American taxpayer when he knew it was a campaign rally. #DonTheCon
I think you missed a trump rally.Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
The Dems siding with Trump again!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
I heard Thighland was against Trump winning the election.
üåçüåçTrump is one TOUGH ....? ! He has proved his grit and not wavered.  Politics is almost impossible not to get sucked into,...Trump has proven, he is the real deal when he speaks
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that
i don‚Äôt care if trump is a dickhead there are literal CHILDREN being SACRIFICED I WOULD RATHER HAVE A DICKHEAD FOR PRESIDENT THAN A RAPIST SATANIC PEDOPHILE
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
Oh you fixed it so Trump can‚Äôt win! You are a genius...
Look at the date!! Again Trump shows his stupidity!!!
Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

We work on Sundays now because of Amazon, why do you think trump wants to charge them more.
I mean trump barely does any of those, so it won't change much, but hope he'll bring back journalists and press-briefings to the WH if he wins
Trump loves using his position to punish Democrat cities and states. He only cares about himself and people who kiss his ass.

I‚Äôm a Latino from Arizona. What Biden meant is that Latinos need to get their shit together and vote their self interest like 90% of black people do! Way too many Latinos vote Republican even though Trump and most of the GOP see us as lesser people.
Lady G. never fails to suck up to a moron. Trump must have a lot of dirt on Lady G. Lady G. sold her soul. John McCain would slap the shit out of you.

You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.

Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!
Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!
‚ÄúDonald Trump Says ‚ÄòA Lot Of People‚Äô Have Thanked Him For Fixing Their Showers‚Äù - WTF? üôÑ

‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.
Nope I‚Äôm not. I will pray for our victims. Obama said he would change America. But Clinton got to the ball rolling. I‚Äôm not sure that GW or Trump are paying members to the club. I need proof.

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!

I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.

trump is more corrupt and more desperate each day. Twisted man knows he can't win in a fair election so he's trying dirty deals with foreign powers. It's time to get this garbage out of the WH.
Bunch of lies from Trump a pathological liar
Trump is the only president that has ever divided this country as much as he has   He is a president that doesn‚Äôt represent all the people just his chosen republicans and the rest of can just suffer. He has to go now. Worst president ever worst human being ever

Trump is not going down alone. He will take you down with him.

I am a former police officer and believe this is a dangerous, partisan move to line up behind the discord that trump is stirring around the election. This is a DANGEROUS and terrible idea.
Trump failed to protect Americans from COVID.  Trump is responsible for 150,000 + deaths. He should be prosecuted. You share in the blame for supporting his bad policy. There will be a reckoning during the Biden administration. Trump, you, and others will be held accountable.
Team Biden, the cheating and corruption is starting from  trump &amp; co. We need to be strong, unified and focused. They will NOT take this election by cheating. Guiliani has an evil streak in him. We will hold our ground. This is still OUR democracy.
And Trump told Pompeo: ‚ÄúI had a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia and he strongly denied he had any Bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

Trump has never been able to understand that the buck stops on his desk. No amount of pointing fingers or deflection can change that fact. He will go down in history as the halfassed President that lead with half measures
Was thinking about hitting the post office today.  Then I thought, Oh no, maybe I shouldn't on Friday.  What if my stuff sits all weekend somewhere? Wait until Monday?  Then I was sad.  With Trump's  destroyer in place,  I'm losing trust in something I have always trusted.
And then count the times tRump has acknowledged and learned from his "missteps."
No one should be surprised that a package of executives orders are waiting for signature. Meadows job assignment was to stall the negotiations, so Trump could pass his orders that have been the making several weeks. Underhanded GOP political trick to benefit Trumps election.
What‚Äôs amazing to me is that shit is so open now that Kanye can admit supporting tRump openly just to draw votes away from Biden.

Ok, if you look at what Biden is saying what he would do for the pandemic It aligns very close to what Trump is doing or has done. So why is Biden loved for his ideas and Trump is torn down for the same ideas?

STOP with the partisan politics Mr Ducey. 4000+ new cases in Arizona in the last 5 days. It's time to start caring more about the people you represent and less time caring about pleasing Trump or attacking Biden.
This makes a lot of sense! Psychologist John Gartner: Trump is a "sexual sadist" who is "actively engaging in sabotage" |
No mainly because of the person he was before his decline. He has been a dispictable person who has never cared for anyone except Trump. I do have empathy for our country having to deal with it now.

Get your nose out of Trump's ass, Doug:  The majority of these "accomplishments" were primarily thanks to local leadership response to your bumbling efforts, ranging from "spineless and ineffectual" to "didn't accomplish jack shit" and "actively dangerous to the general public."
He‚Äôs just gonna make this easier for Trump by the day with comments like that.
I'm getting a lot of patriot notices that they are cautioned and not to follow I noticed are all Trump followers to don't understand it twatter is ran by Nazi communist people wanting to control a freedom of speech.
And enough worshiping at Trump‚Äôs feet. He‚Äôs made a mess of this, and so have you, because you caved as soon as he came to town and threw out the ‚Äúmeasured reopening‚Äù plan. Numbers of tests going DOWN. Schools still not safe. Now what?
The one true thing Donald Trump ever said: if he shot a random passerby on 5th Ave, tools like Biggs would bend over backward to blame the victim. Science &amp; evidence mean nothing to this idiot. #AZ05 deserves a rep with a brain &amp; a heart. #HireJoan
You just have to love AG Barr !! he is knowledgeable, long suffering, intelligent, genuine, and President Trump seems to like him. KAG TRUMP 2020
This tactic wont work.  Biden is clearly demented.  Trump is a lot of things, but there's not much of a comparison.
Unless the commentators actually ask policy questions. Trump has never had policies and has no clue of any that are planned. Biden has many and knows every detail. But if commentators encourage a shot show, Trump always delivers.
Remember kids when Biden (or any Democrat) ‚Äúslips up‚Äù like this it is an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù. Trump does it: ‚Äúevil‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúhateful‚Äù ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone must Vote Blue in November...‚Äù
Do you have a point? If not go back to drinking the Koolaide that Trump says will cure Covid.
Did you tell the President we were doing good until you rushed our opening so he would come visit? That YOU made it political. That all the deaths since could have been avoided with a slower opening. Everything in Arizona lies at the feet of you and Trump.
This assessment is incredible. It literally lacks credibility. Any claim that undermining the US=opposing Trump is a heavily political statement (which also ignores reality).

Yes, the same Democrats who had a bill ready to be approved by the Republican Senate months ago, a bill that McConnell allowed to just sit there while everyone took vacations, and then just expire. Same bill that trump wanted to contain money for WH improvements. Those Democrats.

S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
Unfortunately I'm sure the Trump Org and other real estate emprires will figure out a way to benefit from that idea (which has merit) in a HUGE way.
The article states that the funds given to the national stockpile were used on life saving drugs instead of N-95 masks because masks are usually more readily available. It also says the Trump administration received requests also, in the 3 years before the covid outbreak.

You‚Äôre delusional. Since 2016 there is *no way* Trump has gained voters and he lost the popular to Hilary then already.  Any real conservative would be looking at the polls and very scared of Trump as a candidate if you don‚Äôt want the Dems to take 2020.

Another lying fool. Doug and cara watched thousands die. Finally mayors have helped save us. Meanwhile. I used to respect republicans. Now you are the model. Lying sociopathic fool. Trump Ducey Abbot DeSantis. Lying murdering incompetent scum.
It appears to be just like that.        I hope Trump wins by chasing the snakes away

Could you provide examples of how/when Trump has shown himself to be a Christian? And I don't mean him pandering to Christians like you, but ACTUALLY acting like one...
Holding a bible upside down. He was asked, ‚ÄúIs that your Bible?‚Äù Trump said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bible.‚Äù  Trump bible Version 666.  Once he was asked, ‚ÄúAre you a fan of the Old Testament or New Testament,‚Äù He said, ‚Äúprobably  equal. I think it‚Äôs incredible, the whole Bible is incredible.‚Äù

The economy that Trump built is suffering from an all out attack by democrats who are willing to trash the country in a last ditch effort to change the trajectory of the 2020 election. This too will fail.
The jobs lost were due to a Democrat overreaction to an illness with a lower mortality rate than the seasonal flu.  The jobs they lost were the ones you sent overseas, Obama said were never coming back and Trump incentivized to return so stop lying.
New York, with nearly 3 times the population, is under 1000 cases per day and a positivity rate of 1%. That's what happens when you don't endanger your citizens for political expediency to satisfy Trump. BTW, you're not getting a cabinet appointment.

LOL. NO. Not true.
When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.

Oh now he speaks out because he‚Äôs going to try and help Trump the liar win an election??  I mean we all knew this is what was important to you Doug but you‚Äôve let thousands of people die so he would allow you in. You should be ashamed of yourself, Doug! #DonsNextCon

Not really. In Trump's version the coverage may be guaranteed, but there's no limit on how much they can charge the patient for the services. Under the ACA, someone with a preexisting condition has to be charged the same for insurance and services as someone without a PEC.
Trump is a walking punchline.

Nobody is rooting for the virus! You and Trump seem to be doing the best you can to get us killed.

You mean the Trump Flu, right?
Uh, trump?
Actually, since Trump has committed bank robbery and would like to continuously commit bank robbery without penalty, he'd more likely remove it from being a crime at all.
Wrong, us mere humans cannot control virus. What could be done is let the people have access to hydroxychloroquine, and for that I do blame Trump for not standing  up to big pharma.
Damn right. And we would take a Kasich-Sanders ticket over Trump every time.  No rational, intelligent person could possibly still support Trump.
Nah, ACA already does that as trump's team is in court trying to dismantle it. So what's the replacement?
Good, let the people see first hand the great things Trump is doing. The fake news surely isn't covering it honestly.
He did influence it, and he pays fair wages to legal citizens.   Must suck to be you burning up with hate and envy over  a decent President  Like Donald Trump.

Hey hater, you don't need to follow Trump, but he is your leader, so I understand.   Trumps taxes  are not required for him to hold the position, but Obamas birth certificate was and that has never been produced.
If ACA is unconstitutional &amp; about to be struck down, why is he signing an EO that does exactly what it already does? Once again Trump intentionally lights a building on fire, puts the fire out &amp; takes credit for saving the building - despite being the one who caused the damage.

It's been reported that many Trump voters based their decision bc of a perceived business acumen. It turns out that his so-called acumen has been tied to a $400m inheiritance from his father &amp; several shady, corrupt business dealings with equally corrupt &amp; nefarious characters./2
A "cosmoploitan" person does not speak in such a crude and inarticulate manner. Trump's knowledge of basic history and geography are severely lacking, not to mention his enormous deficiencies in foreign policy, where he runs the gamut from dangerous to laughingstock./1

No one is rooting for the virus except trump. You need to stop parading around like you did something when the only reason things have gotten better is because we have competent mayors who did more than you. And since we still have a test backlog you're riding false #'s anyway.

COVID testing has been slowed by Trump. He actually wants to drive down new case numbers and his move to manipulate the numbers by moving the data to HHS from CDC.  Americans are dying every 60 seconds.  His meeting with Republican Governor‚Äôs was to slow down the testing!

Shut up you opened AZ as soon as your master Trump said to and we won't forget what happened

Twitterer: Basic reading comprehension review: You asked what "action" Trump took. Said you'd wait. Here's the action. When it takes effect is irrelevant to the question you asked, and the answer you waited for. A 'what' question is not going to generate a 'when' answer.
Twitterer: Your wait is over.  I'm sure somehow you'll claim this isn't good or it was Obama's idea, it's racist, or Russia Russia Russia!  Me: Basic civics question: once issued, when do executive orders take effect?  What is today's date?

Biden truly is racist. Remember the "you ain't black" (if you prefer Trump)? Then: "unlike the black community", where he describes blacks as all being alike. He believes (with notable exceptions) black people are identical. He is telling you he is racist. Take him at his word.
Or because God isn't omnipotent? Sounds like Trump doesn't have much faith in God.
Well deserved criticism. Doug Ducey's whole M.O. is playing up to Trump and trying to get McSally elected. He's betting on the wrong horse, as they say.
You are right, we need each other, we need to take steps forward no matter how frightening it is. For me, one of the most frightening aspects of this time in our lives is how ignorant and hateful so many people are. I never realized the power of ignorance that is in trump's base.

I can't watch MSNBC anymore, they are a propaganda mouthpiece for both corporate war parties. They, like mainstream Dem's, PRETEND to "resist" Trump, but they also champion never ending wars, 3/4 trillion military budget, etc.  But to answer you're question, I would guess ZERO.
So based on your response of ‚ÄúSo do you and so does CNN‚Äù you believe is ok that Trump lies because other people do? Once again a Trump supporter defends their ‚Äúgod‚Äù by deflecting and blaming others, and saying ‚Äúyeah but you do it too‚Äù. No accountability. None whatsoever.

I know, it's still incomprehensible bc Trump is far, far worse than Carter (41%) &amp; Hoover (39.7%). But these are the numbers and they do not lie. It's a presidential phenomenom for those who lose. I'm hoping we can change it and vote Trump out in the low 30s. So, #VOTE!
Fun history stats on elections from  Both Hoover (Great Depression) &amp; Jimmy Carter (gas shortages +Iran hostages) lost elections at bottom of their likability &amp; still rcv'd. approx.40% of the vote when they lost. As bad as Trump is, he's in the same losing ballpark.

DAH Of course He Needs all the Illegal's votes! If this Bozo gets elected u can kiss this country GOODBYE. Everything that's going on this BLM BS Unstoppable RIOTS, And chaos is ALL being orchestrated By Dem's TO PROTECT THE SWAMP. They know If Trump WINS PEOPLE WILL GO TO JAIL.
Chuck get a clue.  Trump bungled the response to COVID-19, resulting in the death of 185,000 Americans on his watch.  More cases and more deaths than any other country in the World. We have 30 million unemployed.  Economy in ruins.  Defend someone who is defensible.
Arizona had 13,500 cases on May 15, 2020, today it has 185,000.  Why?  Because you prohibited local jurisdictions from requiring masks.  Numbers came down only after you relented.  You, Senator McSally and Rep. Lesko greeted Trump without wearing masks setting a bad example.
That's PEANUTS THEY ALL STEAL a HELL OF A LOT MORE TAHN THAT! AND WHY NO CHEERS ABOUT TRUMP AND CRUZ PUSHINGTERM LIMITS? LOOK AT WHAT PRICE WE ARE PAYING FOR THE CROOKS MILKING THE SYSTEM IN CONGRESS NOW!
WORTHY? Implies HE EARNED IT BEFORE! There are NUMEROUS Video's of HIS RASCISM HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THEM? I don't know how Saint Hussein could pick him as VP! Trump has done more for blacks than THEIR HERO St. Hussein! He helped Muslims more than blacks.
If by cosmopolitan Dinesh means someone who "travels the world without prejudice and with an open mind," then no, trump is not cosmopolitan. Far from it, at any time in his life.
Like most other things he knows nothing about, trump wouldn't even have known Tik Tok exists if the kids hadn't used it to prank him. He's that ignorant and vindictive.
If trump said it, we know it's a lie. We are a laughingstock, a pitied once-great nation brought to its knees by an incompetent, corrupt president, his sycophants and a cult following. #AmericaOrTrump #AmericasGreatestMistake
If anyone is going to Jail it‚Äôs Biden for spying on Trump, Biden for Ukraine scandal with his son .... Obama for spearheading the most corrupt sting in American history ..... Muller came up empty ... fact ..... high officials confirm that under oath .... sit down Holly
Boom! Awesome. We need more n more Republicans with sound mind and kind hearts to see the light and turn away from this evil pos.
While  administration keeps pushing for schools to reopen.
Flip-Flopping Miss  once called  a ‚Äúrace-baiting xenophobic bigot,‚Äù but then he changed his mind and called Trump a ‚Äúdamn good president.‚Äù Our minds are made up -- it‚Äôs time to END Lindsey Graham‚Äôs career and ELECT Democrat Jaime Harrison.
How about moving the election up so we can be done with him.  is a threat to our lives!!
THIS BLM movement is a organized attempt to create chaos and intimidate voters in election! Marxist Founders, Funding arming, and supported. PERIOD Should be if anything ALL LIVES MATTER! Not a peep about the 60yr old black TRUMP supporter THEY KILLED He didn't matter? Total BS.
Trump ordered his cult to blame China and they obliged.
Good to be out of prison and off probation isn‚Äôt it.  A typical Trump toady/criminal.
AND NO TRUMP
Wrong and why did trump correct himself to tie-land upon repeating the word? Like a fellow twitterer said  "the last time trump went to 'thighland' it cost him 130,000 dollars."
You and Jared politicized COVID, publicized and globalized your own failures, and  weaponized/genocidized the trump virus aka coviDONALD-45 killing 160,000+ ppl in the US thinking it was only going to attack democrats.
Yes, trump is a sad, useless excuse for a human. But the really sad part of this is that there are people who will believe this garbage and live by it and vote by it!
If  loses and is indicted after leaving office, he apparently shouldn't call Joe Biden looking for a favor. Biden's new comments probably weren't what Trump wanted to hear.
Upside: he didn‚Äôt have to meet with Trump or listen to his insane incoherent rant.
Did he test ‚Äúpositive‚Äù just so he didn‚Äôt have to meet with Trump? That would be hilarious.
Well Trump folks administered it, but who knows?
Appropriate that trump's standing in front of washers since he knows all about money laundering.
"Harmful COVID misinformation" .... from the president of the United States.  Watch:
Just listen, please... I just listened to trump speech. All he did was feed fear, and dis Biden. He hasn't told you what he CAN do for you, at all! He promises and doesn't follow through. Doesn't that make you think about your choices? you can do better!
How many Chinese trademarks does ivanka have. Where does trump have all his MAGAt propaganda and other garbage made? CHINA.
stated she is depressed because Trump has racially divided this country. How was her depression when Biden stated blacks don't have any diversity, unlike Latinos. Or, maybe, how she feels about Biden stating in the 70's that integration would cause a racial jungle.
Do you really think tRump really cares about you, or veterans or Christians?
So just the usual bat sh#t crazy rant from trump, the guy who spends his Sundays on the golf course instead of church.
More fake news from ‚Å¶  This is garbage. Try reporting real news for a change. Can‚Äôt even post the facts...
like I want to reclaim my time 20+ times to Barr. not letting him answer just taking 5 mins to chastise Trump! you like all Democrats are hypocrites!
Or der goin back to Trump team illegally surveiled by Obama Administration. Rep Senate tried their best to get Sally Yates to say it happened yesterday in hearing. They chose the wrong witness.
The Mistake by the Lake. Both Trump and the Town...
Not according to the polls. It's Trump who's losing the Black Voters.
Trump is so stupid, he's played by Putin, Erdogan, Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping and other world leaders. He thinks they're his friends, but they think he's the world's biggest idiot. Add Macron, Merkel, Johnson, and the rest of the EU. They're all laughing at his stupidity.
And that‚Äôs why this morning‚Äôs ridiculous spin by Azar regarding AZ‚Äôs situation was so blatantly political. Ducey is Trump‚Äôs bestie.
Well and what we are told by Trump folks isn‚Äôt true. I‚Äôm sitting here listening to Alex Azar lie his ass off. Praising AZ for controlling spike w/o closing businesses. Say what??? We shut down bars, gyms and indoor dining. Almost all businesses require masks to enter.  Soo huh??
Yeah kinda like the FDA co-signed hydroxychloraquine? Trump has compromised all govt agencies. I won‚Äôt be convinced until British Oxford epidemiologists and Fauci say it‚Äôs reliable.  Our govt isn‚Äôt trustworthy.
Same and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs all bad. I wish to know WHO is benefiting financially. I don‚Äôt like the fact that CEO made humongous stock buy the day before Trump announces he‚Äôs using DPA to make loan. Huh?  Why can‚Äôt we use DPA to invest in Abbott tests.  Point of care testing?
In case there is any doubt, in Old English, the name Donald Trump literally means ‚ÄúGreat Deceiver. ‚Äú Look it up. What will he (20K+ lies) and coconspirator Billy Barr concoct before the election? We shall see. You know it‚Äôs coming. #ChristiansAgainstTrump #TheTruth
THIS IS WHY 'THEY' MUST WIN TRUMP WILL DESTROY THE SWAMP AND THIER DYNASTY! PEOPLE WILL GET INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED IF TRUMP WINS AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO WIN.
THEY have an ACE up THIER sleeve, THEY know Biden cant debate Trump. THEY know BIDEN has DIMENTIA they have a PLAN IN PLACE. THEY ARE INSANE BUT NOT STUPID! We better be ready to FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY!
Trump/kushner/GOP &gt; genocide &gt; The Hague
They like mentally ill. Case and point - trump. Easier to manipulate.
It's if cute you think trump wouldn't if you were. He would say he didn't know you. FORE.
Exactly! I have an absentee ballot for the Rep party here in Lake Cnty FL. On the OUTSIDE of the envelope where postal workers can see it, it clearly shows REP..what's to prevent them fr holding back any ballot marked REP and a vote probably for Trump?  Nothing.
its almost like even HE doesn't believe he will win in November.....so, WHY put forth the effort.....which, frankly, has been his approach since his inauguration,
Shut him down! Twitter is not the primary way the President should communicate to the citizens of this country.
Facebook removed a post from   ‚Äôs account for spreading misinformation on Covid-19, the first time the social media giant has done so related to the coronavirus pandemic.
It's baffling why the GOP is pushing so hard to get Kanye on every state ballot in the hopes he'll take the black vote away from Joe, giving Trump a win for a 2nd term. They know Trump is obviously a racist, yet they'll use race to win.
The GOP is pushing him on the ballots in as many states as they can so he'll (hopefully) siphon off Black voters who would have voted for Biden. The Republicans are scared to death and trying every trick in the book to push Trump to victory.
You could apply your first sentence to Trump as well.  Fair is fair.
This time during Obama's first term (5 Aug 2012), Obama's approval rating was 46%, Trump is at 48%. Don't believe the fake news polls that American's don't support Trump. Rasmussen has Biden at 48% and Trump at 45%, well within the 3% margin of error #RasmussenReports #Rasmussen
Yates herself went rogue by not immediately resigning from DOJ after Trump won! Conducting Pelosi resistance at once... treason!
Also I don‚Äôt watch cable news. I watch congressional hearings, read Trump‚Äôs ridiculous twitter feed and I READ. The man contradicts himself daily and is basically, incompetent.  But hey, that ‚Äúyour favorite news source‚Äù comment was a typical nonsequitur.
I didn‚Äôt say I did know. But I do know what Trump is doing &amp; this Rep has had enough. He lies incessantly, undermines experts &amp; NO, his testing strategy is piecemeal-patchwork. It‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt get our arms around this virus. Look at the other industrialized countries. Shameful
Did I say it was ALL on him? No!  I said the Fed Govt has 3 responsibilities in a pandemic.  1. Messaging 2. Procurement and distribution  3. Nationalize Testing  Trump has failed miserably at his only real job. Keeping Americans safe. You asked why Biden? Cuz folks want to live.
Please stop being Trump‚Äôs stooge!
Nah, you support Trump, you a racist. Don't gotta call a person a wetback or the n word. The mild support for that man, is your support of racism. End of discussion.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Time to call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
Let‚Äôs call it what it is... the trump virus. Make him own it.
From now on may it be known as the trump virus
Trump destroyed America. Now, it's run by a bunch of corrupt swamp minions and idiot grifters who violate every law they can, use mob tactics to run the government (Flynn, Cohen, Barr to name 3) and have managed to make the world hate us. The government is a cesspool.
That is complete crap.  Why are you spewing it.  Trump and some Republicans are attacking the integrity of elections.  No one else.
Agree.  Nothing to be gained listening to Trump‚Äôs lies.  Refuse to debate unless Trump releases all of his tax returns.
Who is supposed understand this? What is it saying? The way I see it. If we are intelligent enough to elect Trump in 2020 the Enormous Good that will transpire as a result Will Insure DEMOCRACY for EVER!
As Always the Clinton's and MOST other Demoncrats have Immunity for our Mortal Laws. That's what this election is REALLY ALL ABOUT Protecting the "SWAMP" The hate TRUMP because THEY CANT control him HE WILL PROSECUTE THEM and THEY KNOW IT! If he gets elected THEY LOOSE!
That would have been enlightening, but not in a good way for Trump.
Lying Trump mouthpiece, one of the most useless people who ever lived, chimes in.
Trump:  ‚ÄúSome were doing very well, and we thought they may be gone, and they flare up, and we're putting out the fires. But other places were long before us, and they're now‚Äîit's got a life, and we're putting out that life, because that's a bad life that we‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù
Trump could go on these shows and present his agenda for his second term instead of airing his grievances and hate ranting. Oh? He has no agenda? All he has is grievances, self pity, hate and boasting about things he didn't actually do. Sad little man. #AmericaOrTrump
Spicer lied because he was forced to and didn't seem to like it. Sanders was a natural liar. Scaramucci wanted the notoriety.  McEnany is a practiced with no conscience. Trump always replaces people with worse people.
BLM is not a group. It's a belief that embraces acceptance and inclusion, a movement that rejects racism, mistreatment and oppression of people of color. It's supported by decent people of all colors across this country. It's one of many reasons Trump will lose. #AmericaOrTrump
INDICT TRUMP ORG
Attila the Hun and Ghengis Kahn. But I doubt Trump knows who they are has he's extremely history challenged. If it's no on Fox or OAN, he has no clue...
No Trump will win because like AZ, the rest of the country is tired of letting the lunarics run the asylum! Trump 2020. Why can‚Äôt y‚Äôall figure out that we don‚Äôt want America run the democrat way?
This too funny Trump talking üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©ü§£üòÖü§£üòÖü§£üòÖ
Feeling your anger. Trump makes me mad to my American limits, which are far more profane and not nearly as polite as your Canada limits.
Apparently FL contacted WH and pressed Trump to support mail-in voting in FL, as his messaging is suppressing senior voters. Most of whom, are HIS supporters.  Oooopsie
On Manhattan‚Äôs district attorney seeking Pres. Trump‚Äôs tax returns, fmr. Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why Trump is pushing back on it so much and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because the documents show that he‚Äôs innocent.‚Äù
Duck you trump
What an embarrassment to the USA.  The man cannot pronounce Yosemite.  This is why  has so many cult members. They love that he is the same level as they are; stupid.ignorant.
Well, we can understand why trump wasn't invited to speak at the services. He would have made it all about his grievances and how he's done more for Blacks than anybody. What a pathetic little man.
Should Joe Biden participate in a debate with  He‚Äôs willing to. But why would you give one more platform to a lying, insecure loser like Trump?
The president is trying to discredit Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Anthony Fauci for telling us the truth about the spread of COVID-19.   Please vote Trump out in November. We need someone that will listen to doctors.
We thought New York prosecutors were pursuing Donald Trump's financial records as part of a hush-money investigation.  The scope of the probe now appears broader - and more significant.
I would point out that but for Comey‚Äôs violation of FBI policy in announcing just before the 2016 election that the FBI was investigating the email messages found on Anthony Weiner‚Äôs computer Trump likely wouldn‚Äôt have been elected.  By the way cover-up any sex abuse lately?
And there is some problem with that? In my education in a Military School similar to President Trump, I was taught "If you cannot say something nice it is better to say nothing at all" We are NOT required to LIKE EVERYONE Nor ARE we required to Agree with there ideas or Ideals.
If you think she despises the orange carnival barker her dad is on another level beyond the clouds. imagine dinner time at their house!
I think Americans should get on to the trump campaign for terrorism because they TERRORISTS families into thinking help might not come if you dial 911
We need to deal with the trump virus!!!!!
Huge problem here with the Trump virus!
#ImpoutusAmericanas ‚Å¶ is gonna give the matter some thought on a golf course soon. Just hang in there... #8645ElevenThree20 #VoteForMyAmerica #VoteForOurLives   Trump Says He May Act to Stop Evictions Amid Virus-Aid Talks #SmartNews
Ohhh he‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs favorite bad guy. Kissing Cousins
Trump doin another hostage presser. He‚Äôs back to happy talk and rainbows regarding Covid. He should just stop talking.
They WILL BE if Trump GETS RE-ELECTED THATS WHY "THEY ARE IN PANIC MODE" They MUST win OR the "SWAMP" Gets EXPOSED and we GET TERM LIMITS THEY LOOSE THEIR Dynasty!
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Eulogy MY AZZ that was a POLITICAL SPEECH From The Democratic Pres, that DID the LEAST of any of the LAST 5 for BLACKS. He DID most FOR THE MUSLIMS! He knows if TRUMP GETS ELECTED "HE" Gets INVESTIGATED HE is TRYING TO SAVE HIS AZZ. HE IS CAMPAIGNING!
But the 60 year old black man Trump supporter "THEY" SHOT in the head DIDNT MATTER? Should be ALM All Lives Matter! On the Jumbotrons THEY should Run Videos Of Arlington Cemetery, and Vietnam memorial wall With the words ALL LIVES MATTER. SHOW what THEY ARE DISREPECTING!
This is why he's so desperate to win re-election. By 2024, he thinks the statute of limitations will have run out and he'll be in the clear to built Trump Tower Moscow, and Pyongyang and Manilla and Ankara...
I watched my aunt descend into dementia. She saw shadowy figures everywhere. Strangers called her day and night. They took things from her. She warned her neighbors. They called the police. Paranoia. Fear of losing control. Hallucinations. Trump is losing it.
Of course THEY dont want Debates They know Trump will Destroy Biden. Biden's dementia is getting worse! They keep him HIDDEN while they try to find a Drug to get him through personal appearances! He is a Trojan Horse there is NO WAY IN HELL he can handle being president.
If Biden isn't capable to face Trump, how can he possibly face ruthless leaders of countries like North Korea, Turkey, Iran, etc?
when the Dems lose in Nov they will say it‚Äôs because of Covid that there voters didn‚Äôt go out to vote Then Adam SHIT will try to impeach Trump again for Voter suppression and unfair election It will never end  when Trump wins re-election 4 more yrs MAGA2020
Bullshit  He's a criminal and cheated his way in to being president! You are a criminal for allowing it to happen! You are a disgrace to the American people by allowing trump to get away with all of his criminal activities!
own son attends a school that will not fully reopen for in person class, because of safety concerns about the coronavirus.
CDC says tRump tested positive today. However he did pick the elephant picture correctly.
Spewing nonsense and lies as usual. You have no decency.  Nevada is trying to keep voters safe in the pandemic Trump caused wth his nonsense and lies.  Washington. Oregon and Arizona all use mail-in voting with virtually no fraud.  You should be ashamed of yourself.
really wants to become a dictator.

No and in fact it seems as though in the age of Trump, we‚Äôve taken steps backward. This saddens me. For many reasons.
Notice he only got violent with the woman.  Yeah real manly
Oh sorry! This guy. Stephen Miller, Trump adviser. Possibly the most horrendously callus anti immigration czar on Trump‚Äôs team. The man is a damn reptile. If we are equating receding hairline with underdeveloped brain?  He Wins!
Promises made seem a lot easier than promises kept.If you're not sure exactly what a conman is then watch this video.üßê Trump provides a textbook example.
I love the Lincoln Project!! Keep up the excellent work!!üëèüëè
How the hell did these "morons" get in there? This is 45's followers new mentality. They are above the law and follow no rules. Just do whatever the hell they want. I hope there was a consequence for that stupid action.
Why bother campaigning?  You and your family better get use to the idea of being passed around in prison.
If it doesn‚Äôt directly benefit me? Screw it.  Let ‚Äúthe peasants‚Äù flounder. Cuz hey! That‚Äôs the Trump way!  #WorstPresidentEver
Nothing, Nada, Zip, Zilch!  There never was a healthcare plan, there is not now a healthcare plan,  and Trump will never give us a healthcare plan.  #TrumpLies #WorstPresidentEver
HEADLINE READERS PROPAGANDA! What Trump said WAS Tongue in Cheek, and look at the RESPONCE! The DEMONRATS say EVERY VOTE COUNTS, TRUMP says EVERY LEGAL VOTE COUNTS DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE? ALL LATIN AM POOR Countries HAVE NATIONAL IDS AT 18! But NOT POSSIBLE HERE? WHY IS THAT?
They are getting what they Voted for! It will only get worse. If Trump gets RE-ELECTED "THEY WILL BANCKRUPT" If Not "They will jus PRINT MORE MONEY" Until ALL money is USELESS and HYPERINFLATION KICKS IN. Followed by Socialism followed by Communism!
I can't help thinking it was trumps plan when he put an idiot at the top position in the postal service. Now that man is suggesting holding back 1st class mail. Which will wreak havoc on mail in ballots.  Trump always has an illegal plan.

Trump and his followers are Pathetic! Pathetic! Pathetic!
Nope and rushing it for political expediency is not a good look. I‚Äôm not all that confident in the independence of the FDA under Trump.
I think in Trump world, money &amp; power speak volumes. If he‚Äôs gone? If basic tenants of govt can be restored in a reasonable amount of time? Well then I revise my prediction to essential and health workers first (which is fine), but I stand by mid 2021 before this reaches masses.
157,727 deaths from COVID-19, all on Trump‚Äôs watch and all his responsibility,  30,000,000 unemployed.  Steepest drop in GDP in 145 years.  No plan to do anything about it.  Now that is a record to be proud of.  There is plenty of enthusiasm in Joe‚Äôs campaign.  November 3, 2020.
I do think it's a good idea that if you support trump, you should stay home AND DON'T VOTE,
Because he is Clinton! Saint Hussein is getting the SAME PROTECTION from HIS CORRUPT ADMINISTARTION ACTIONS! This Election is 1776 IF Trump doesn't WIN Kiss Democracy and Rule of LAW Goodbye! "THEY KNOW IT" Best outcome is 25 states secede and make a NEW LAW ABIDEING Country!
who didn‚Äôt honor his oath, keep the House, take the Senate and dump trump.  We deserve better!
I think their boat has sailed.  Do not trust our lives and Democracy to the republicans and trump.  Vote Blue in every election.  Not voting or voting independent is a vote for republicans and trump.  Let‚Äôs vote out every republican Senator and Representative
Never let polls make you think we don't need every vote. Never assume Biden doesn't need your vote, because he will have enough. We need to defeat Trump by a land slide, to let the world know.
Ali Velshi discusses how  has favored states that voted for him, often at the expense of states that voted against him, and how that may have affected the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The vicious and secret attacks on President Trump are heinous crimes and unprecedented!
My granddaughters (all college age) were ready to re-elect Trump (following their parents lead~~they live in Mississippi) until he threatened to take away their Tik-Tok. Now they're incensed he's crushing their freedom of speech. Maybe this will wake up the young voters?
#Christian misleaders, as God continues to divulge Trump‚Äôs over 20K evil lies, it is not and will not be acceptable for you to say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù You knew! Your hardened hearts just refused to see. ‚ÄúTo whom much is given, much is expected.‚Äù #TheTruth #ChristiansAgainstTrump

‚ÄúThis is not complicated, Republicans,‚Äù Joe Scarborough says.  ‚ÄúYou have a president that‚Äôs on the wrong side of every issue on the coronavirus ‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got a president who is on the wrong side of race.‚Äù
Pompeo, and Barr, are speaking to Trump supporters, who don't know or care that he has no authority to change the election date. He will try anyway and throw it to the courts to sort out, making it look like they are being unfair to him. Just more Trump distraction and confusion.
NOTHING HAPPENS if TRUMP LOOSES THATS WHAT ALL THIS ONGOING BS is ABOUT! They are in PANIC MODE "THEY KNOW" if TRUMP WINS THE "SWAMP DIES" Trump/Cruz are SPONCERING "TERM LIMITS"! AND you can BET SAINT HUSSEIN and HIS CRONIES WILL GET PROSECUTED! GOD BLESS AMERICA! VOTE 4 TRUMP!

How's that booming Trump economy working for Trump supporters now? Enjoying unemployment, self isolation under a bridge after eviction, and going to bed hungry? Maybe make a better choice November 3. #AmericaOrTrump
I hope TRUMP does not have to comply! I would think that the Constitution has something to SAY about Criminals Illegality in the country being counted as Citizens and being given Rights of citizens! God I hope so.
By the way where is that very inclusive health plan that you were going to offer in two weeks?   That was more than two weeks ago.  Just another Trump lie.  I printed them out and them all in a box.  The box is so heavy I need a fork lift to pick it up.
You are the living reason why we need an intelligence test for voting.  You and Trump would both fail.

Donald Trump recently boasted, "We are in the process of developing a [coronavirus] strategy that's going to be very, very powerful." He was finally asked where this strategy is. His answer was ridiculous.I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
It looks like the big Bernie flips didn‚Äôt get what they thought Trump promised and are done with him.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
I met some1 tonight at our weekly ‚ÄúTrump Friday‚Äù social that showed me all the key damage, dents from pellet gun and more damage because his license plate says TRUMPUS
this ice documentary has me so fucked up right now but it lit a fire in me to know what goes on every day while were at home watching tv not worried ... i would kill before they took my child from me ‚Äúimmigration nation‚Äù FUCK DONALD TRUMP
You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
This a Trump trash type statement that is beneath the office he was elected to by the people of ARIZONA.   Shameful display of pettiness and gaslighting.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
So much for the added value of a Trump pardon ü§≠
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
This pretty much sums up the Trump Administration.
well it would be funny to have adult businesses only open in republican states just to show the divide between the two logic....and somehow they would blame trump..to funny
Trump campaign has two candidates. An INVALID ONE, and a FAKE POTUS
Attacked relentlessly for corruption and avoiding accountability for his actions..... kind of an important piece they left out because he‚Äôs fighting for himself, against these investigations into his conduct as POTUS.... NOT fighting for America  Donald Trump ‚â† America
Donald Trump is already doing that......... next, ho
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Joe, please explain to us how you get credit for the growing economy, but not the blame for turning Libya into a bombed-out slave-market shithole.  If all you can do is have people script stuff for you linking you to Obama and bashing Trump, you're going to lose, and deserve to.
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
I dont pay to much attention untill one month before the race . I can hear everything they say and have said then.
Shocker. Most trump fans on Twitter are bots
The next 3 months Trump, with enormous help from Russia, FOX, &amp; OANN will try &amp; demonize Biden &amp; his VP pick. They'll try &amp; get us to stay home. We need to remember that our whole democracy is at stake &amp; come out &amp; vote Blue down the ticket - Biden &amp; every Senate race!
The weren‚Äôt added they were closed for the virus and reopened  not added . Trump is just Stupid
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.
Yo Donny guess what? By Election Day your support won‚Äôt top 28% &amp; your sorry pathetic ass sinks. So don‚Äôt say you never heard that, OK? By March, all the remaining GOP in Congress will continuously repeat 2 words ‚ÄúTrump who?‚Äù
Agree. This is a tough one . I live in #MaricopaCounty and spent 2018-door knocking for #Dems . The Latino community has PTSD from horrible #Arpio and #Trump is worse. They are scared. Difficult to engage.

Trump explained it was a peaceful protest to the Press at this PRESS CONFERENCE  Guess You Didn't Know That, Hilltards LOL
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Republican would like to See the postal service close down on Trump word becasue he want to cheat the election. And we all know there is NO mAil-in ballot fraud! And you can‚Äôt provide any proof
You tweet more than Trump
Absolutely. They are project Lincoln, not #VoteBlueNoMatterWho bcuz they hope to revive their party. They aren‚Äôt supporting our ideals. They are trying to get rid of Trump. Working w/ Reps to promote our ideals or win is different than giving money. Give to  #AZ08
Yes, something is very wrong. He has had his nose too far up Trump's ass. It's making him delirious.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
I've already said that she does not represent me.  She reeks of Donald Trump.    I want you to represent #Arizona, you up for that challenge?
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that

Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ

If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.

You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
Now, that‚Äôs rich.  I have noticed how hard the left tries to loop Trump into all the bad moves they themselves have done.  I don‚Äôt think Trump is part of the evil lefts crew.
If President Trump leaves Twitter so do I.
Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made
I didn't hate Obama. I strongly disagreed with everything he stands for.  The Left? They HATE Trump. They Hate him.   Trump was elected by a little more than a quarter of eligible voters.  Assuming half eligible voters are Republican WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER in November.
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
He just had his head inflated by the trump admin. Don‚Äôt you know he‚Äôs a model governor now?! Lmaoooo üòÇ
Speaking of Thighland, just wait until Trump sees Niger on the teleprompter.
This is a political ploy to keep Americans poor and begging so when he throws out a bone under the term "executive order" and be seen as a magnanimous savior. Puuuuke.  PASS THE DEMS BILL  Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
$20 says trump has definitely called mike pence ‚Äúmike FENCE‚Äù before. üòÜ
The Left hates Trump. They Hate him with a capital H. They will say and do anything to get rid of him.  We must vote and vote like we never voted before to ensure he's reelected.
You work for this guy?
Looks like we have Kanye Trump or maybe Donald West (aka  ) oooh, I like donald west, running for prez in wisconsin! What a bunch of crap.
And you think Biden's the answer? Things were great before the China Virus! Trump is the best for America!
Exactly. Cooper feigns concern and like you said, is trying to pin it on Trump.
Should he hold campaign events that get people killed instead like Trump does? Herman Cain is dead. Don't know if you heard that, John.
Repubs trying to keep the American citizens poor and begging so when trump throws out a bone he can look like he is magnanimous.  What a joke.  PASS THE DEM BILL
You're obviously a Romanian troll for Trump so this conversation is over. Again, have a lovely evening.
You wanted the states to handle it so they did. Don‚Äôt blame trump for 160k dead
So many of you hate Trump because you say he is racist but this clown gets a pass? If we are being honest I have seen far more racist words and actions from Joe. C'mon man Biden
Trump says he may take executive action on evictions, student loans, payroll taxes if no aid agreement reached
I accidentally bought one that said something about Trump on it but I can't find the packaging right now
Legal challenges to come.... But Trump doesn't care since it's just a campaign thing
We also express gratitude toward our primary opponents on a hard fought race. Looking toward November, I know now more than ever all democrats throughout Arizona are united to defeat Donald Trump, Martha McSally and Republicans up and down the ballot. #BlueWave2020
‚Äúare poorer, less educated, and many have not left their home states‚Äù is a spot on description of Trump supporters.
Trump is simply simple and pathetic.
LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Yeah, I wouldn't believe Trump even if he told me it was raining while he was standing outside in a hurricane!
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
Trump is corrupt. Calling his event at his Bedminster Golf Club a ‚ÄòPress Conference‚Äô so the event would be paid by the American taxpayer when he knew it was a campaign rally. #DonTheCon

President Trump is the best...and the media cannot stand it.
The GOP is dead, replaced by the National Socialist Republican Party bent on turning the clock back to 1841. They're heartless only interested in how much more money they can steal for themselves from whatis fast becoming the Late United States of America
Sleepy Joe could not beat his way out of a wet paper bag!               Trump 2020!                   MAGA!
Trump Makes Ominous Statement About Powerful Enemies, Not Seeing Him For...  via  For rest of base, please be not ignorant.  Trump presidency is not the norm.  He has many powerful enemies.  We need to wake up so that hes not fighting alone.

Calling bullshit on this. Pompeo won‚Äôt oppose trump.
Great! Now President Trump has a good reason to void the trade agreement and restart the trade wars! Time to stock up on popcorns to watch China CCP die from thousand cuts!
I‚Äôve been waiting for you to release your environmental policy since 2019, and you‚Äôve never once contradicted trump.   Prove me wrong!

All this was done by Obama but you could not see it because you worked for company that hated Obama but loved trump lies and what happened they kicked your can out from fox irony
Again, just more tiresome partisan BS from  supported by his lame Trump GOP. So much for a deal maker!!
I really wish Fred DuVal would just apologize. I read the column before any commentary about it and was dismayed. It read me as though he is an active Trump supporter. And then to learn he is not supporting Marsh?
Breaking: trump invented Obamacare!
So do you believe the women who have accused Biden as well? Or am I guessing there is nothing to see there. I never claimed to be a trump supporter either. You need your noodle checked homie. You automatically think because someone disagrees with you they are different.
And yet, you do have to say it. If it‚Äôs up to trump and goons like Gosar, one of the Seven Wonders would become a polluted toxic waste site.
Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!

Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
Is this a Joke? The ACA that Trump is trying to kill in court already did that. What next Make them cover your dependents until they are 26.
You should be voting Trump. Take Obam out of your avi. Judgemental hag.
Trump should be charged with crimes against humanity for boarder children's prisons and lack action during the pandemic). Kelly Ann Conway, and each senator standing with trump should be charged as well... at least as an  accessory.  via
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!
Wow sorry Bill you are the best!  Twitter wants Trump to lose the election.
Trump is a modern day Hitler! Or should I say a want to be? Yes; he has nearly succeeded in destroying America, the world's most powerful country. We must get him out of office! It's vital for America's survival. He's evil.
Maybe there is but whether or not there is or isn't Trump has to promote it as the Dem/Lib's narrative is that Trump will get rid of the pre-existing conditions safety net.

At first, I was afraid to walk over to the new road-side Trump t-shirt stand, but then all three of the OTHER people who got off the public bus with me went to the t-shirt stand, as well! We ALL ended up buying something! (lol, I was afraid they'd make fun of me.)

is a Big idiot who does nothing more than kiss the ring to appease Trump. I feel bad for all the people he suckers into thinking that he's any kind of a leader.
So #Russia wants Trump to get re-elected.  Reason enough to vote against Trump. But I wonder if #Putin, oilmen realize that Trump's incompetent mishandling of the #coronavirus #pandemic is suppressing #oilprice? Demand for #Oil won't rise until #COVID19 in control.
He's one of Trump's androids sitting on a pile of bribery cash, that doesn't care about lives of AZ residents!  Trump wanted the border states to be the most affected with COVID. That's how come he paid most of the Governor's like AZ, FL, TX, big money to not to a damn thing!
how about you contain/eliminate/defeat COVID 19 -trump virus-  very quickly before Nov 3, 2020.
Don‚Äôt waste your breath, Trump supporters will forgive him for anything. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a cult.
One more reason why Trump will be re-elected.  Pence Will Make a Campaign Stop in Wisconsin During the Democrat Convention While Biden Stays Home.
The Trump ads in the Phoenix TV market against Biden contain one lie after another- it‚Äôs disgusting and disreputable
I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere and tried Fox. Chicken Heir was scolding dems for not liking Kanye West. Said ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt think all black lives matter‚Äù. But anyway.. trump was just in a small corner.
‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.
How has Trump capitulated in China?  He has been supportive of Xi, and extremely critical of the CCP. Shouldn‚Äôt that be the correct posture if there is any hope of China breaking from the CCP?
How many people were killed in so called Trump‚Äôs America because he perpetuated conspiracy theories? That‚Äôs why the death toll became so high in the first place because there was no one leading America. And why we‚Äôre screwed, republicans are still refusing to care about Americans
Nope I‚Äôm not. I will pray for our victims. Obama said he would change America. But Clinton got to the ball rolling. I‚Äôm not sure that GW or Trump are paying members to the club. I need proof.

Trump really does think we are all that stupid
It‚Äôs not about that all. The Dems are the ones playing hardball and politics. Trump is telling them to get a deal done or he will take care of the American people by executive order. If the Dems sue him over that then they were like horrible.
It's true, the govt is responsible. Trump crashed the economy when he ignored the briefings he was given on the virus back in January

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?
He was called out by a reporter for people in room not following CV guidelines.  Trump said he was calling the meeting a peaceful protest and a political gathering so there was nothing to worry about.  Turned and left. BOOM!
When the democratic party elites choose a terrible candidate for president to run against Donald Trump, it doesn‚Äôt take many votes to siphon to keep Trump in office. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
They want to talk with reasonable knowledgeable officials. trump‚Äôs wants quid pro quo.
Nearly 200,000 Arizonans have been infected and Doug Ducey thinks that his inefficient leadership is somehow a success story. If the Governor was as serious about his response to COVID-19 as he is about kissing up to Trump, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have over 4,000 dead in Arizona.
President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.

Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.

See what I'm saying. We are leaving the cards in his hands. We need to make our hand stronger. He's going to deliver our issues if we don't. It's all about winning for him, whatever it takes. Some for McConnell. Why he gave go ahead to distance from Trump.
Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!

Trump 2020
I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  Wow
Not according to trump. Per him, jobs are just being created all OVER!

Pure hell. Trump will be plotting to undo the election if he hasn‚Äôt already rigged it in his favor!
Watch how fast media finds out about studies supporting the idea and bland trump for not doing it sooner.
We are on a bad path and Trump has bungled this entire effort, but Wolf, if you want to be transparent, it‚Äôs important to point out that,overall, France, Italy, Spain, and GB have roughly the same deaths/100k as the US. Germany has done a much better job.
did Trump just extend condolences to Lebanese families? Before he has ever said word one for COVID families right here in the US?????
Trump feels if he sends everyone to the poor house or no house he‚Äôs that much richer

U are an elected official. Unfortunately for the country ur  party has put U in a position that is hurting the country terribly. U demand that President Trump answer all kinds of questions. Here U are..U get asked like five questions a year and you cannot take it
Obama didnt put kids in cages he was only starting to plan too Trump was the one who actually kept the plan going. but why do you keep bringing up obama? hes not the president anymore TRUMP is and its because of him that our country is so corrupt.
Trump really needs to get rid of those that undermine him and work for another agenda.
Yes right Obama caused many to be full blown depressed when he was pres.he was the worse president we have has trump is the best
obama? didnt know he was still in office TRUMP is hes the one who countinued what obama started but what do you have to say about all those kids he lost? right cause all you guys know what to say is trump 2020 get a life.
Someone is SCARY! ü§£ TRUMP! I Can Smell You Sweating like a hogüòÇü§£üòÇ

Democrats passed a relief bill to protect the 20 MILLION AMERICANS who have lost their jobs and cannot return to these jobs that no longer exist.  Republican and trump inaction harms average Americans every day.   LOSERS and LIARS

Microsoft offering to buy tiktok just so Trump can‚Äôt ban it shows that not all heroes wear capes üò•
Trump just spoke about human trafficking for 5 minutes in his press update, not one follow up question. Instead they are asking about Kanye.
Pro-Life life administration? 155,000 people are dead from COVID19 due to a lack of planning by the trump admin. That doesn't speak pro-life me.
Well Eric. We are going to give Donald Trump all the help he needs. We‚Äôre going to re-elect  him another four years to continue to make America great. But more importantly the most important thing is to make you liberals go literally out of your ever loving mind. You‚Äôre welcomeü•Ç
... which to me makes Trump either incompetent or a liar.. or he's just held off on using this info to manipulate this very election. In any case, I honestly cannot work out a scenario where you are correct and this isn't just a GOP conspiracy theory.
and trump isn‚Äôtüòπ? you trump supporters sure are funny hes far more mentally ill hes lost over 2,000 kids and he puts them in cagesüòê. Trump is not in his right mind.
No matter how hard trump and his cronies try to paint Joe Biden as weak, Biden is still going to kick Trump butt this November election.
It is the trump government Manipulating tactics.

Lol yeah, tons of cases.
What's pathetic is it is 2020 and you're still defining a woman's worth by whether or not she has a husband or children. How about recognizing she's a person first all on her own. Also cut the bullshit because we all know your ass voted for Trump.
Trump and DeSantis are cooking up something bigger than the Bush/Gore elections. Watch Out America.
Just the fact that he refers to it as the China virus grates on my nerves. Seriously, World - Americans are not all xenophobic racists, even if Trump is one.
Why is it that postal service can handle mail in ballots in Florida but not in Nevada?  Could it be because trump placed an unethical person in charge to meddle in the election across America?  LOSER
20 MILLION Americans, and a disproportional people of color, are unemployed thanks to trump economic policy.  LOSER!
Your interpretation of the data is bizarre!  The USA trails all developed countries in testing and has far more deaths due to trump administration mishandling and lack of leadership.  LOSER
Voting by mail is proven to be safe and the best way to combat obstruction provided trump administration interferes in ballot delivery-which is very likely.  LOSER!
It's a pandemic,  are you going to blame every world leader because their citizens are dying? Biden isn't posting these comments, the real power players are. Didn't the Bubonic Plague go away?

Now let‚Äôs hear from the accused child molester....trump has the best people in his swamp

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Today‚Äôs headlines after the GDP numbers: ‚ÄúTRUMP IS WRECKING THE ECONOMY AND COUNTRY BY NEGLECTING THE CORONAVIRUS‚Äù
Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to change the election date.
While everyone freaks out, just know Trump can want to delay the election all he wants but he doesn‚Äôt have the Constitutional power to do so. It‚Äôd have to go through the House &amp; Nancy Pelosi, which obviously won‚Äôt happen. He can say whatever he wants, it ain‚Äôt happening
The only person who can beat Donald Trump in November is Donald Trump
Racist is a no brainer. Rude, condescending behavior.  Being a trump supporter  for sure!
Trump said a  key word there didn‚Äôt he. But you lunatics don‚Äôt want to pay attention listen. Are they paying for these weapons? We had an actual terrorist Soleimani killing people like my son. And you cried about it you sympathized... So you are the lefy you lunatics STFU losers!Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
The Dems siding with Trump again!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
I heard Thighland was against Trump winning the election.
üåçüåçTrump is one TOUGH ....? ! He has proved his grit and not wavered.  Politics is almost impossible not to get sucked into,...Trump has proven, he is the real deal when he speaks
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that
i don‚Äôt care if trump is a dickhead there are literal CHILDREN being SACRIFICED I WOULD RATHER HAVE A DICKHEAD FOR PRESIDENT THAN A RAPIST SATANIC PEDOPHILE
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
Oh you fixed it so Trump can‚Äôt win! You are a genius...
Look at the date!! Again Trump shows his stupidity!!!
Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

Why attend? Trump calls a last minute presser at his golf club. You find that golf buddies are attending the presser. The golf buddies have likely paid to attend.  You know it will all be bluff and bluster. Why not investigate who got invited and why. It is the only story.
So now senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa are teaming up with Russia to spread negative information about Joe Biden. I am now convinced that Russia not only paid Trump, but that they paid every Republican in Congress. House and Senate. #Traitors

We work on Sundays now because of Amazon, why do you think trump wants to charge them more.
I mean trump barely does any of those, so it won't change much, but hope he'll bring back journalists and press-briefings to the WH if he wins
Trump loves using his position to punish Democrat cities and states. He only cares about himself and people who kiss his ass.

I'm saying it is a hell of a gamble to let Trump win and then *hope* you can remove him from office, then it is to elect Biden and then hope you can outflank him politically
I think I'm at the end of my rope with Trump, the GOP, and trumpsters!!! They ALL make me sick to my stomach!!!
I doubt there‚Äôs any accident in this. In fact, I bet the same reason accounts for the supposed drop in AZ positive cases of late. Team trump is not to be trusted and his minions are everywhere.
I would.
Trumptastic news!  Trump strips the AHA,  attempts to give back pieces,  sycophants spread the news, and  wants praise and adulation.    This IS the school yard bully stealing your jacket, getting off on watching you freeze, then giving it back expecting gratitude.  #ETTD
You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
You're assuming that we'll still have elections at the end of a second Trump term.
Trump is a Putin puppet.
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
I'm with China and Iran on this one.  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump

The GOP Senate might want Trump gone more than the Democrats do.
No vaccine with my name on it. Trusting God's plan.
Sen. Chuck Grasley and Sen. Ron Johnson...both Republicans...are knowingly passing Russian disinformation about Joe Biden into the Trump campaign according to a top National Security official. KNOWINGLY!
It is obvious. trump and repubs are using the American people as a political ploy. If trump comes in with executive orders he wants people to see him as helping which is UNTRUE. Shame on trump and the Repubs
Political ploy to make trump seem like he's helping Americans. PASS THE DEM BILL. It is the best bill BY FAR for Americans. trump is trying to use Americans as leverage.   Trump may take executive action after virus stimulus talks collapse
The only thing Biggs will be leading after November 3rd is the Freedom Carcass. Leading Trump sycophant who had money handed to him via PCH couldn‚Äôt care less about those who have lost their jobs. #VoteHimOut

do some FAIR reporting and see what happens. All you so called journalists do is ask gotcha questions. Haven‚Äôt you guys learned by now President Trump is just way to smart for all that bullshit?
Now, that‚Äôs rich.  I have noticed how hard the left tries to loop Trump into all the bad moves they themselves have done.  I don‚Äôt think Trump is part of the evil lefts crew.
Sinema &amp; Stanton are Repub lite &amp; McSally is a Trump ass kisser. And all 3 love the Military Industrial Complex! It's big $ over here in AZ.
Hear Trump's response when asked what mistakes he's made
cant help his Sheriff buddy  .. loses re-election bid .. Trump is on a losing streak
This is a political ploy to keep Americans poor and begging so when he throws out a bone under the term "executive order" and be seen as a magnanimous savior. Puuuuke.  PASS THE DEMS BILL  Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Repubs trying to keep the American citizens poor and begging so when trump throws out a bone he can look like he is magnanimous.  What a joke.  PASS THE DEM BILL
We also express gratitude toward our primary opponents on a hard fought race. Looking toward November, I know now more than ever all democrats throughout Arizona are united to defeat Donald Trump, Martha McSally and Republicans up and down the ballot. #BlueWave2020

Again, just more tiresome partisan BS from  supported by his lame Trump GOP. So much for a deal maker!!
So do you believe the women who have accused Biden as well? Or am I guessing there is nothing to see there. I never claimed to be a trump supporter either. You need your noodle checked homie. You automatically think because someone disagrees with you they are different.
Get your head out of the sand! YOU did nothing but leave decisions about mask use and social distancing guidelines to the city mayors and school districts. YOU deflected. YOU are unfit to lead &amp; the fact Trump praised YOUR efforts, frankly, is laughable!
Lady G. better hope that trump will hire you as a caddy next year. In November you are going down but I guess that you‚Äôre used to that.
Trump is just crazy!!
No preference but I love the new Sam Elliot adds for Trump.
Just more tiresome insanity from the Trump GOP!

‚ÄúYou cannot do evil that good may come‚Äú is the first rule of morality. Voting for Trump is evil. Consider his personal vices, criminality , racism, cruelty and penchant for dictators. He is a demagogue. Biden is patriotic family man who obeys laws.

I know this is beyond your comprehension Doug. Trump flu doesnt care if people cheer it on or not. What an idiot. There is no requirements about a Governor having any intelligence just any moron like Ducey will do?
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.

trump is more corrupt and more desperate each day. Twisted man knows he can't win in a fair election so he's trying dirty deals with foreign powers. It's time to get this garbage out of the WH.

I am a former police officer and believe this is a dangerous, partisan move to line up behind the discord that trump is stirring around the election. This is a DANGEROUS and terrible idea.
Trump failed to protect Americans from COVID.  Trump is responsible for 150,000 + deaths. He should be prosecuted. You share in the blame for supporting his bad policy. There will be a reckoning during the Biden administration. Trump, you, and others will be held accountable.
Team Biden, the cheating and corruption is starting from  trump &amp; co. We need to be strong, unified and focused. They will NOT take this election by cheating. Guiliani has an evil streak in him. We will hold our ground. This is still OUR democracy.

Trump has never been able to understand that the buck stops on his desk. No amount of pointing fingers or deflection can change that fact. He will go down in history as the halfassed President that lead with half measures
Was thinking about hitting the post office today.  Then I thought, Oh no, maybe I shouldn't on Friday.  What if my stuff sits all weekend somewhere? Wait until Monday?  Then I was sad.  With Trump's  destroyer in place,  I'm losing trust in something I have always trusted.
And then count the times tRump has acknowledged and learned from his "missteps."
No one should be surprised that a package of executives orders are waiting for signature. Meadows job assignment was to stall the negotiations, so Trump could pass his orders that have been the making several weeks. Underhanded GOP political trick to benefit Trumps election.
What‚Äôs amazing to me is that shit is so open now that Kanye can admit supporting tRump openly just to draw votes away from Biden.

Said the Governor who was the last to close his state and the first one to open, without following the CDC guidelines for reopening, because Trump came to town. Maybe Ducey should go to Trump's basement and become his bunker-bitch. Way to talk to a respected VP. #IdiotInChief
Bulls**t. Stop your lying and blaming. Trump was left a pandemic playbook that he threw out. There was also 3 yrs btwn Obama leaving and the start of this pandemic for Trump to replenish. He also ignored intelligence coming from China.   #AZ05 #HireJoan
10 to 1 says trump can't pronounce cosmopolitan.
"On Wednesday, Vice President and somewhat-sentient Trump skin tag Mike Pence flew to pandemic-awash Florida."
Biden is right!  We went down hill when you caved into Trump. No one will ever trust you again! I was a lifelong Republican but have now switched parties. Voting blue no matter who. When your time is up, you will be out! Killing seniors?? Here?? Gone!
Trump is a "bystander in chief".
well ,   had no problem allowing indoor Trump Rally at the height of pandemic with no masks . What is the point in following science only when it suits your political belief ?
I don't think he ever was for President Trump he bragged about getting interviews with Laura Trump I'll bet they vetted him and said no thank you.
What did trump mean when he said yesterday that we won‚Äôt see him for a while?
Get your nose out of Trump's ass, Doug:  The majority of these "accomplishments" were primarily thanks to local leadership response to your bumbling efforts, ranging from "spineless and ineffectual" to "didn't accomplish jack shit" and "actively dangerous to the general public."
He‚Äôs just gonna make this easier for Trump by the day with comments like that.
And enough worshiping at Trump‚Äôs feet. He‚Äôs made a mess of this, and so have you, because you caved as soon as he came to town and threw out the ‚Äúmeasured reopening‚Äù plan. Numbers of tests going DOWN. Schools still not safe. Now what?
The one true thing Donald Trump ever said: if he shot a random passerby on 5th Ave, tools like Biggs would bend over backward to blame the victim. Science &amp; evidence mean nothing to this idiot. #AZ05 deserves a rep with a brain &amp; a heart. #HireJoan
You just have to love AG Barr !! he is knowledgeable, long suffering, intelligent, genuine, and President Trump seems to like him. KAG TRUMP 2020
This tactic wont work.  Biden is clearly demented.  Trump is a lot of things, but there's not much of a comparison.
Unless the commentators actually ask policy questions. Trump has never had policies and has no clue of any that are planned. Biden has many and knows every detail. But if commentators encourage a shot show, Trump always delivers.
Remember kids when Biden (or any Democrat) ‚Äúslips up‚Äù like this it is an ‚Äúhonest mistake‚Äù. Trump does it: ‚Äúevil‚Äù, ‚Äúracist‚Äù, ‚Äúhateful‚Äù ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù, ‚Äúeveryone must Vote Blue in November...‚Äù
Do you have a point? If not go back to drinking the Koolaide that Trump says will cure Covid.
Did you tell the President we were doing good until you rushed our opening so he would come visit? That YOU made it political. That all the deaths since could have been avoided with a slower opening. Everything in Arizona lies at the feet of you and Trump.
This assessment is incredible. It literally lacks credibility. Any claim that undermining the US=opposing Trump is a heavily political statement (which also ignores reality).

Yes, the same Democrats who had a bill ready to be approved by the Republican Senate months ago, a bill that McConnell allowed to just sit there while everyone took vacations, and then just expire. Same bill that trump wanted to contain money for WH improvements. Those Democrats.

Interesting to see if and how battle lines might be drawn.  Pretty easy for teachers unions vs Republican Governors / trump allies in other states. This could be more blue vs blue combat if it materializes.

S. Rice bad pick and T. Kane all over again.  Does not really help Biden and certainly not with progressives.  Son big Trump supporter.  Connections with Clintons hurts. Biden is connection with Obamas. Fine choice for Sec. of State, not VP.
Unfortunately I'm sure the Trump Org and other real estate emprires will figure out a way to benefit from that idea (which has merit) in a HUGE way.
The article states that the funds given to the national stockpile were used on life saving drugs instead of N-95 masks because masks are usually more readily available. It also says the Trump administration received requests also, in the 3 years before the covid outbreak.

The economy that Trump built is suffering from an all out attack by democrats who are willing to trash the country in a last ditch effort to change the trajectory of the 2020 election. This too will fail.
The jobs lost were due to a Democrat overreaction to an illness with a lower mortality rate than the seasonal flu.  The jobs they lost were the ones you sent overseas, Obama said were never coming back and Trump incentivized to return so stop lying.
New York, with nearly 3 times the population, is under 1000 cases per day and a positivity rate of 1%. That's what happens when you don't endanger your citizens for political expediency to satisfy Trump. BTW, you're not getting a cabinet appointment.

When Joe Biden often makes gaffes, he at least has the audacity to apologize. For that reason, I let them slide. When does Donald Trump ever apologize for his gaffes, frequently insensitive (to put it nicely) remarks, unprofessional statements, etc.?
Pres. Trump has been very philanthropic in his life and his wife encourages him to be better every day. She is the reason for his current stance of helping others and prolife. Best look at the whole picture. Biden is not know for his philanthropy just his time in politics.

Keep religion out of the damn debates, the presidency isn't a religious title and shouldn't be treated as such. If journalists want to press Trump and Biden on their religious views, fine, but not in the debates for presidency.
I agree that Trump should be challenged on these statements but leave it out of the debates. I'm sick enough of Christian politicians using their theology as a reason to suppress women's private healthcare decisions. I dont need to be hearing scripture in the debates.

I know one thing that'll change Nancy Pelosi said she would retire if Donald Trump wins. But she's a f****** liar because a lot of people said if he became president they leave the country. Nobody ever left they just kept looking for more attention and going against him.
I‚Äôve been a trump fan since I was a kid. I‚Äôve seen across my life this man make buildings and businesses, not all made it. But he tries.. I try y‚Äôall try. I‚Äôd like to hear commentary about why you like or hate trump and why??    #KAG2020

GOP continues to lie to Americans. Trump isn't POTUS.  Jared is.   At least Joe won't install his kids in the West Wing.

Bitch about Covid19,  Bitch about doing this right bitch about who's not right, now? What we do about the politicians ?  President Trump's the only one who's not overpaid.
Best president ever Donald Trump! Even if the Nazi Democrats won't even give him a chance. I know we have the China virus but he has to get back to cleaning out that swamp. That's the only way he is going to be able to succeed everywhere he wants for American people.
You have the wrong attitude. I'm white and I vote. I didn't vote orange. People didn't vote orange.  Trump lost the popular vote. won the electorial vote. Politicians voted orange.
So the truth is that the Dems are actually guilty of allowing foreign influence to impact the 2016 election. Once again, they are caught red handed doing the very thing they accused Trump of doing. Anyone paying attention? Everything the Dems did to bring Trump down was just lies
Doctors stand behind President Trump, call for reopening America thanks to miracle drug.

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
One other observation: You seem way to obsequious to the President.  He and his administration have botched this big time.  You really need to distance yourself from Trump before you go down with him.

Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey is a tool and a boot licker for Trump. He is a complete failure that only thinks about his own future. He doesn't have the huevos to mandate masks and cherry picks (lies) on the data. He needs to resign.
It will be interesting to see how China reacts. They are already over the pandemic and are up and running. The US can't take a trade war hit and Trump knows it.

And arizona is going down on infections cause of our mayors not our governor he couldnt even mandate the mask we didnt get everything our dr med staff needed either and the testing tract &amp;tracing govern ou r ducey failed that one too you failed trump
So, based on what Trump says, I assume you voted fraudulently, voted for a few dead people and immigrants, voted more than once.....right?
Because trump is too dumb to realize killing a bunch of kids and teachers/adults who work in schools is the worst thing to if he wants to be re-elected. Consider the timing of when we‚Äôll see this next spike in deaths related to school opening + the election. He‚Äôs done.
I really wish he was only trying to boost his fame..... but he is trying to split the votes, help Trump stay in office. It's really a crying shame if that foolishness works.
So Trump?
Sounds like Obama: "Tell Vlad I will be more flexible after my re-election."  Yet Obama allowed Russian interference he knew was happening and Trump has put Heavy Sanctions on Russia and beaten them on the oil/energy front.  You have swallowed too much Democrat Kool Aid.

Nooooooooooooo! tRump MUST be held accountable!
Germany wants America to protect it from Russia, but turns around and supports Russia buying natural gas from them. Garmany hasn‚Äôt paid their NATO bill, owing billions. Stop buying German cars and other products. President Trump take all our military out of Germany
Past election have been won my republicans than lossed a few weeks later when found missing ballots suddenly appeared. 2020 election will have massive voters fraud using bulk mail-in voting. Democrats already tried to over throw President Trump with Russia hoax.
I am so disgusted by some post i read today from liberals.  When did it become OK TO JUST SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT KNOWING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS TRUE IN YOUR STATEMENT.  HATE HAS MADE DEMOCRATS LIBERALS &amp; ANTI-AMERICANS LOOSE THERE MIND.   HATE FOR 1 MAN POTUS TRUMP Vs best for USA
I can‚Äôt believe that the American People want four more years of Trump‚Äôs fear mongering and Republicans incompetence !!
Trump's narcissistic fantasy is that he could be "president" forever &amp; that everyone would believe in "Trumpism!"  Sorry Donald, that fantasy is coming to an end in November when MILLIONS of Americans say NO to another 4 years of this madness.   Your not qualified!!
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  MENDACIOUS, "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  UP UNTIL NOW, HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!

Trump can't negotiate a ramp, and a bottle of water.  Your candidate does not have the high ground.
If Trump doesn't want to disclose who his Daddy is by releasing his taxes, he should be disqualified from running. Period.
Why?  Here in the US, people either blame Trump or Obama for everything regardless of what the facts say.
He also wanted to impeach him...but yeah...Trump should just ignore all that and blow kisses.
No.  Don‚Äôt take his words and misuse them like that.  They were talking over each other but Trump clearly said: ‚ÄúThey took that and made such a big deal.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äù is in reference to him wishing her well NOT the fact that she allegedly participated in child trafficking.
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  MENDACIOUS, "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  SO FAR HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Isn't it the Trump supporters who constantly criticize any little mistake Biden makes? I guess it's only ok 1 way.
TRUMPICAN'S IS THERE NO BOTTOM TO YOUR SUSPENSION OF BELIEF IN FACTS?????  "TRAITOR TRUMP", THINKS HE CAN CON YOU FOREVER!!!!!  SO FAR HE IS RIGHT!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Did Trump just say it was a terrible ‚Äúattack‚Äù in Beirut?
Controversial topic but i hate Trump for the sole purpose of his ideologies Trump isn‚Äôt our president because Trump is here for America as a whole the only thing that Trump has offered that‚Äôs good is the fact he‚Äôs bringing America out of debt other than that he‚Äôs still terrible
It should read ‚Äúlet‚Äôs scrap the presidential debate since sleepy, creapy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt hold his own against Trump‚Äù
It's okay.  I wish others could improve, but I fear for Trump it is too late.
I wouldn‚Äôt! He wouldn‚Äôt stick to the facts, he‚Äôd get all blustery and bullying, he‚Äôd be playing to and audience that enjoys a soap opera drama rather than listening to actual facts. Trump can only filibuster. Waste of time. Let‚Äôs just vote.
I don‚Äôt have a religion. I have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I don‚Äôt put anyone or anything above Him. My wearing a Trump mask to church doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm putting Trump over God anymore than my neighbor wearing a Raiders mask is them putting the Raiders over God.
States buckled to Trumps DEMAND to reopen without a strategy! When the experts recommended a phased approach Trump insisted REOPEN NOW. Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership and concern for being re-elected is why we‚Äôre in this mess- wake up!
I couldn‚Äôt care less about Trump
As for me I am voting "one time" for Trump and hopefully we do get twice as many votes that will out match the double votes for Biden.
And trump keeps saying we are doing better than any country in earth üåè what do saywe put him on the next mission to MARS
Don‚Äôt believe her as lies like Trump.  A Trump Hack
So does  now wish  well?  What about Peter Strozk and James Comey?  Trump couldn't bring himself to wish John Lewis well and he condemned John McCain to Hell.
Over 150,000 Americans dead and Trump claims success and said ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù.   THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE #Biden2020
Not the inside of trump's an cavity unlike most of his supporters....
I guess I need to find videos for you of trump doing the same thing.  They both suffer the same issue, old age.
Meddling?  Is that what you call it when Trump endorses a Republican, too?  Just curious.
OMG! Ok... pay attention. Simple. We could stop testing nationwide TODAY and thousands of people per day would still be DYING! Trump would be happy with lower numbers .. we‚Äôd still be DYING! Why is that so hard to understand!
‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù says Trump about dead Americans.
We all know who does and who does not have a plan. Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan for anything.
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!  YOU MENDACIOUS, NARCISSISTIC, SUBHUMAN POST ABORTION SCUM!!!!!  WE MUST RID OURSELVES OF THE CANCER WHICH IS YOU!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020
#TrumpIsNotWell Trump is declining in mental acuity daily! He just doesn‚Äôt get the trouble we‚Äôre in, and flat out doesn‚Äôt care.
Well, that it is a small sacrifice Trump is willing to make, you know, letting everybody die before he admitted he was wrong!
Disagree Trump need to come out against the use of HCQ...overnight it would become widely available and the media would praise its use!
People will tell you everything they hate about Trump but can‚Äôt tell you what they like about Biden üòÇ
Watch this video about trump-  According to Trumpall the countries in the worlds stats are wrong but trumps
Trump is all lies and propaganda  no truth allowed
if Trump's lips are moving, he's lying and dividing
Trump was laundering Russian mafia money, colluded with them to undermine our elections, and ,yes, he will likely go to prison in 2021  maybe you too
Great song, great beat, great win for President Trump
Of course it's Trump's fault.  What isn't?
#Trump I have disabilities and I need you to help me I need to get disability I worked the same job for 20 years I broke my back and they let me go please help me
You‚Äôre right Trump is on Earth while Biden is lost somewhere in the universe üòÇ
Just like in May when trump came here and leaned on the govorner to open the state, Trump‚Äôs going to lean on him again to open schools.  And, Ducey will fold like a deck of cards.
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.
TDS at its finest. David Hogg had a good point there. Too bad he can‚Äôt have President Trump agreeing with him. That would show too much unity in a time of divisiveness and we can‚Äôt have that!
YOUR INCOMPETENT, INEPT, PLAN TO NOT HELP THE BLUE STATES WHEN COVID-19 WAS DEVASTATING THEM, HAS RIGHTFULLY BACKFIRED, AND IS NOW DEVASTATING MOSTLY RED STATES, SQUARELY PUTTING TRAITOR TRUMP'S RE-ELECTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, THANK YOU!!!!!

Trump Hack. All BS
We need to get rid of Trump virus then we can get a competent leader to attack the COVID-19.    Trump is killing us not listening to Expert Doctors, Mandate Masks, and improve Testing.   #TrumpVirus #Biden2020 #Fauci
If Trump's lips are moving, he's lying
McSally is a Trump Hack.  Lies Lies  During her two terms in the House of Representatives, McSally repeatedly voted to repeal the ACA, perhaps most memorably in 2017 when she reportedly used profanity to exhort her GOP colleagues to join her on the vote.
We need to have immediate fact checker or no debate. Every word Trump saids is a lie
Trump hack.  I do not believe a word she states
"TRAITOR TRUMP"!!!!!
TRUMPICAN'S, HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT PURE EVIL LOWLIFE, HOW DO YOU DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE, HOW DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES, "DON'T BOTHER ME WITH THE FACTS, I'VE MADE UP MY MIND, IS THER NO WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO YOU HOW MUCH PERIL, TRUMP HAS PUT US IN, IS THERE?????

HEY BOYS AND GIRLS, UNCLE JOEL HERE!!!!!  A QUESTION WAS RAISED, WHAT WOULD TRUMP DO IN A CRISIS, NOT OF HIS INITIAL DOING, YOU DRAW YOUR CONCLUSIONS!!!!!  TRUMP FAILED TO RESPOND, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A NATIONAL SCIENCE-BASED REPLY TO COVID-19,
Trump says he took it and he‚Äôs fine. But he‚Äôs not fine; he‚Äôs now even more psychotic than ever and he‚Äôs clearly unwell physically. #TrumpIsNotWell
These are not children  and one of them is on the government payroll. None of the former Presidential kids was in that category. Not Obama‚Äôs, not Bush‚Äôs, not Clinton‚Äôs, not Nixon‚Äôs - none of them!  Notice no one is tearing into Tiffany or Barron Trump.
Not to worry he is taking his personalized Trump knee pads.Hell no. It was good and getting better under Obama. Trump ruined everything
Well Chuck he just tired everybody, so your letter &amp; harsh words were not a threat! The GOP &amp; trump are now proceeding on breaking every law of norm that gets in their way of a reelection! Time to use the legal systems to save America, because trump doesn't fight fair!
you are apparently a big Russian propaganda mule now! How does it feel to give away the United States to trump &amp; Russia? Hope your happy!

This is trumps America.  The only people that should be on trump's side are the very rich, or the White Supremacist, because that's the only voters trump cares about!
trump's rhetoric on a hot Mike sounds just like his crazy tweets on twitter! Who calls reporters "killers" &amp; then expect respect from these dedicated journalists? #PresidentSnowflake CAN'T be a Winey Reality Star  &amp; a President!  Trump has chosen to play the "star" #VoteBlue

tRump is not a man ; he is a small-minded creature that only thinks about feeding his own self interests , and "reproduction" ? How is it the GOP is so afraid of someone with such low intelligence ?
You are so right! They go out of there way to kiss up to trump!
The Republicans in power have thrown their common sense out the window to prevent a mean trump tweetüò†
Why would doctors and scientists know anything about viruses? Trump's "super genius" thinking knows all
Run worse I am sure you meant run worse. Governors killing people to honor trump's wishes are now killing 1000+ people a day! But you be You &amp; show you just don't give a dam about those other people! Saving lives should NOT be a partisan issue!
Fake News Mr trump! Your numbers are always fake news!
We know those are just recouped jobs. Not new jobs like Trump wants us to think
WTF?  Trump is initiating a spiritual awakening?
It's these type of people that support Trump and it scares the rest of us
Trump looks like he morphed into Bill Clinton.
Trump is anything but a Christian. He just using it now because it sounds good
Watergate was it for Nixon. Trump has gone way farther than Nixon, the events are numerous. Trump should resign, he is dangerous
Trump's America sucks! I am so sorry about your uncleüò¢
I think someone found a good place to put the trump Library and who knows he might spend the rest of his days reading thereüòÅ
Any bets the Trump campaign did not pay for the rights to play this song either ?
Just a Trump ploy to siphon votes from Biden. Maybe if there was a normal candidate, it would be a good try.  Voting for Kanye would be a waste of time
The country is grieving. Trump would have you believe we are not. #VoteBiden2020
Trump thinks Thailand is part of North Korea ?
When you say it like thatüòÅüòÅüòÅ Trump really should stay away from the God argument. He can't even hold a Bible right!
#ETTD the Rick Wilson Book still haunts me &amp; Trump's disastrous leadership is a big blaring Stop Sign
I wish. But it's not going happen as long as Trump is in the White House
Seniors know that one of the downfalls of aging is missing your words. The inability to read can be signs of dementia or Alzheimer symptoms! It is an obvious sign that trump is not prepared &amp; does not practice his written propaganda! I want a prepared President! #AmericaOrTrump
Agreed. It will show Trump knows nothing. But.... Religion has nothing to do with politics and should never be the measure of a person
Trump says it only unsafe for ballots, everything else it's safe. Wtf?
Another example. I guess Trump's control of the virus didn't reach that farr
Trump needs to be completely neutralized
TRUMP
Open schools now are proving they aren't immune. Trump disregards the facts
There's nothing godly about Trump. He doesn't believe nor read the Bible
I think trump folk, even with all their Evangelical leaders &amp; following,  DON'T understand praying is not a sign of weakness, not is the ability to feel empathy &amp; sympathy! But it does emphasize the trump inability to feel empathy or care for others. #TrumpFailedAmerica
It's was your choice and right. I have no trouble with it. I'm sure there are others in the same situation. I didn't think Trump would win either
This fits your prison idea, &amp; also the trump library problemüòÅ
Me too! I used to not worry about every day politics &amp; the chaos that they could cause like forgetting to sign a bill to build a bridge. Now I wake up at night, wondering if trump will start a nuclear war to try to hold on to the worst presidential Administration in history!üò¢
So now Jared, Ivanka &amp; trump all do their own thing on unsecured phones, but no one acts that IT'S even a problem. The double standards on any women in power is so 1950s! Hypocrisy or misogyny? Both?
This should say "Meadows falsely claims Democrats did something wrong, when in fact Dems passed a bill 3 months ago &amp; trump &amp; McConnell failed to act on it!"
This man is as evil as trump!
Yoo is just a dangerous as Trump.
Another Trump attempt. Ridiculous
The text is obvious, it's not Twitter text, so its not official. I hate Trump anyways.

We are not surprised, Trump always lies.

The GOP and Trump want to take your Social Security that is why the Democrats won't agree to phase 4 Covid relief.  We are 3 months away from the election and STILL AARP an organization that is supposedly meant to help Americans of age hasn't said one G.D. thing ! VOTE BLUE !!
I don't think anyone with a lick of sense would vote for Kanye. But then there are those who voted for Trump.
Trump Criminal Enterprise.  We have not seen the full extent
The debate would be a no contest for Biden. Biden would out show Trump.
Let me sure, if Trump loses the election, how can he quit? He would have to quit before the election, then Pence takes over. Am I confused on your point?

Opinion | If one reporter can demolish Trump, where are the rest?
In fact it took 13 years and trump being in office to get a 13 year old case unsealed,  because Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and others were named as pedophiles in it.
In regard to the Axios interview, how can Trump say he didn't recall meeting John Lewis, but can remember that John Lewis wasn't at his inauguration?
Trump loses election - " it is what it is"
Uhh..because it is. Trump has no idea what he got himself into. It's a joke.
Trump gives his approval for mail-in voting!!!!
Motorcycle accidents,  gunshot wounds, shark attacks.   They are covid related deaths, because they tested positive.   The numbers aren't even near correct.   Not to mention it's a different disease, and the infection rate is much lower than 2009.  They want trump to cure it too.

The positivity rate is 21% in Mississippi highest than any other state in the country. Trump isn‚Äôt concerned about students,teachers and staff. It‚Äôs all about his re election..
Oh believe me, I hate Donald Trump as much as the next person does. You're right.  He did do this, Trump wanted this. He even had interviews about a second civil war, it's sickening. I'm learning though and hearing more about the protests. I agree with the protestors.
Just a guess, but trump was hooked by Jonathan's smooth voice, &amp; the idea he could be seen on HBO and be so close to those Hollywood stars? Then Jonathan used those big words of his &amp; the deadly complete sentences. It fools trump every time!üòâ

Yup trump stepped on George Floyd's neck, in a liberal city.  I didn't realize he controlled all the police districts.   I also never realized he ordered his so called  "goons" to burn down said liberal cities.   You lefties are blinded by hate.  Orange man Bad!

So Trump has to go outside the US for support and from Authoritarian leaders!  He wants to be President for life like Putin, but that's not going happen
Looking forward to your concession speech but you are Trump and would never give one because you are a sore looser.Biden is going to blow you out.The American people want something done about this virus and as long as you are President we will be in this condition...

I understand that you live in a fairy tale mirror world, where the good guys are the bad guys and vice versa.  Those court documents that I went through proves that without a doubt.   You project onto Trump what the Democrats have been doing for decades.

He's like Trump. He doesn't care, has no principles, no morals , no empathy.  It all about politics and what helps Trump's image.  He's failed
And Trump listened!  Both are guilty. So they used the virus hoping to deplete the Democratic voters
Just another attempt to subdue protesting. It was shown that these protests had not spread the virus, but Trump's rally in Tulsa did.
Hey Liz, do you know who wasn't implicated?  Hint: Donald Trump In fact the prosecution said he helped them build a case.  It seems we've been right all along!

Trump is a wanna be
Trump is attempting what Putin did in Russia. To be in office and control.  The founders were very particular in what they placed in the Constitution.
I say vote Trump off the island and deport him come November.
Get it together!  You are not doing your jobs. Focus in the nation and the people, uphold your oaths.  You're being to sound like Trump.
Let them get sick, their choice. It will be a mistake, like supporting Trump
Thank you Bean!
Because people would rather believe lies than see reality. It's ingrained since childhood. They don't use common sense or reasoning. They, like Trump, blame others for their troubles
I see following Trump to the end. Trump said he took it, but that's not proven. We will see what happens.
Just waiting for the next Trump tactic.
GOP = dumber then a rock Pence = crazier then a look Trump = crazy like a Fox because he got all the GOP to follow his lead!
The buck stops here. - H. Truman  It never reached my desk. - D. Trump
I won't ever be a Trump supporter at all. I just want to vote for Biden and get it over with.
Oh I have a vote and a conscience.   My wife has a vote and she's a bernie bro, but she's voting for trump.  She knows Bidens a racist, pedophile, rapist.  So she's voting for trump.
They are also interfering with the election by not giving Trump equal time. I see Biden ads all day long on Hulu, Netflix, even Fox. But Trump's ads are no where to be found.

Seriously, he comes back from a visit with Trump and acts like a Trump puppet. Ducey has shown zero leadership, leaving it up to mayors and county boards to decide on masks. Maricopa County's mask mandate is reducing numbers overall. School opening will skyrocket AZ's numbers!

Everything he said about Arizona's cauvet numbers was a lie. Yet the media keeps giving him free airtime for lies and then there's no correction. I would like to see Joe Biden do a press conference after trump and correct all the lies.
If the press can give airtime to the liar in chief why can't job I the do a press conference after trump and correct all the lies publicly?
What if Joe Biden did a press conference after trump everyday and  Corrected his lies in his exaggerations and his facts and figures. It's starting to be too much. For example I'm from Arizona in today everything he said about Arizona was totally incorrect.

What possible difference does that make.  Had the virus originated in the US trump would have the excuse that he had no opportunity to take a proactive stance.  It started thousands of miles away and trump squandered 70 days before responding.    The place of origin is irrelevant

It has NEVER been called thighland, instead of admitting trump effed up AGAIN, you defend it. He said it the correct way after he miss pronounced the word.
Twitter is a joke. Trump is trending because he mispronounced Thailand, meanwhile Biden insults every black person in the country and there is not a peep. Go ahead and elect this incoherent racist if you want to. See what you  get . #BidenCognitiveDecline #BidenIsARacist
Trump effect.  Though I feel sorry for any Republicans that got short changed by this.  Make it a teachable moment, and play it safe, by voting in person on election day.
I just watched this interview, totally incredible and boggles my mind that for the total length of the interview he totally ignored the message you were conveying about the need for NATIONWIDE rapid testing committment from Trump. It was truly unbelieveable!!!! #SadButTrue
Let's get the scarecrow Biden into a debate with Trump. We are all waiting for this to happen!
Michael Muscato has a real opportunity running against Debbie Lesko, Arizona's Enabler of the Trump. She, along with McSally and Ducey clung  like all good Republicans to the Super Spreading Trump rally six weeks ago. Now, they want you to vote for them,
I have no proof that he is but from what I've seen he definitely is. I'm not a Dem but I don't like Trump's Republican party. I liked the old GOP. Just me.
Uh, how could they be the person of my dreams if they‚Äôre a trump supporter?
YES, WIN OHIO BIGGER,WIN PA. BIGGER, SHOW THEM PRESIDENT TRUMP,YOU ARE THE GREATEST BY FAR. FOR THE PEOPLE! PROMISES MADE &amp; KEPT. KEEP WINNING FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL FREE COUNTRY. YOU MAKE THE LAWS, WIN WIN WIN ! ALWAYS,GOD BLESS YOU!!!!

So Mark Zuckerberg &amp; pals have been helping ONLY right wing pages &amp; posts avoid fact checks &amp; negative consequences on #Facebook while simultaneously pushing negative hashtags about Biden &amp; removing negative ones about Trump on #Instagram....#MarkZuckerbergisRatfuckingtheelection
It‚Äôs all Trump has, trying to make opponents to the Trump Party and himself look worse than them.
So GOD needs Trump to save him? The creator needs Trump? That people believe this makes me very sad. Actually hurts my soul.
So you pull up videos from a few months ago but you don‚Äôt explain his RAPID decline.  He is incoherent &amp; refuses to come out of hiding and won‚Äôt even debate Trump.  There is a reason his wife was interviewed &amp; not him.  He can‚Äôt form complete sentences &amp; rambles.
SURE AS HELL DOES NOW.  Other than you father, No Republican stood against the asshole Trump. That brand is sullied forever.

They say that a chain is only as strong as the weakest link. Trump is that weak link.
No you are taking it out of context. He was making a point. I bet you he knows how to say Yosemite, unlike Trump who pronounced it Yo-Semite.

Sturgis in South Dakota it's still going to happen! An expected 250,000 people are going to show up to this little town. Does anybody else see this as a problem?  Apparently not, because nobody's trying to stop it. If Trump wanted to save lives. He would stop this biker rally!üò°
Let's just wait till the election and see how many votes he gets. And then together we will watch Trump take the swing States and possibly take the election. And the both of us will be crying come January when he's re inaugurated
I never said his followers were black. I said he had 29 million followers. you're the one that put the Assumption there black. I'm just saying he's going to get votes, he's going to take it from Biden. and it's going to help Trump
WTF? Now the devout catholic who goes to church every Sunday, is going to get rid of religion? How is he going to hurt the Bible? Trump worshipers will believe him too.
Sadly yes somebody will. He has I do believe 29 million followers on Twitter. even if only 5% of them vote for Kanye. that's 1,450,000 that's enough for Trump to take key battle states
I wonder what the justice department has to say about the trump modeling agency ivanka?  Didn‚Äôt you work there at one time.  #turnedhisdaughterout ?
I have no problem having a third party. I wish we did have a third party.what I'm saying is, what Kanye West is doing is just bulshit. he's taking votes from Joe Biden and the Trump campaign is behind it.
Trump's just said that he thinks the vaccine will be ready by November 3rd. But also went on to say that its not because of the election that is coming out on November 3rd, he says, I just want to save lives. LOL it's all about the elections for Trump
This person is truly talking about is the democrat party is overflowing with FRAUD and ABUSE  they have demonstrated this history of decades. Basically the democratic party ALWAYS blames others for what they do. They blamed President Trump about Ukraine but Biden actually did it.

I don't believe any votes are going to come from Trump. I believe every vote will be from Independence and Democrats. I find it hard to believe you can find me one Republican that would vote for a black. I'm not being racist, I'm being truthful
Hey Trump. Why don't you give us just one of your favorite quotes from the Bible. Lol

Yeah demand away, he‚Äôs a Trump stooge sent in to destroy the post office.  Sue him.
Omg, he is not going to be on all 50 states. Therefore he has no chance of being president. His main reason with the help of the Trump campaign is to siphon votes away from Joe Biden and putting asshole back in the White House
And the Republicans ignore the fact that Trump can barely put four words together and make a coherent sentence
Trump proved his ignorance every day. He wants to move the debates up before early election starts. Doesn't he realize anybody that's going to vote has already had their mindset. And him standing up on stage lying about the same things, are not going to change anybody's mind.
Like it or not Donald Trump is the best choice for presidency for the next four years. You may not like how he says things or his arrogance But he‚Äôs created jobs lowered our taxes put money in our pockets and our economy is booming.

THAT IS WHY I KEEP PUSHING FOR THE MILITARY TO INTERVENE, AND BACK TRUMP AND OTHER PATRIOTS IN OUR GOVERNMENT....  IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THIS MANY TREASONOUS TRAITORS, AND GET AMERICA BACK ON TRACK....   PLUS, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IS INCREDIBLE, THE BEST IN THE WORLD....
IT IS ETHER MILITARY INTERVENTION, OR THE COMMUNISTS, THEIR MEDIA, AND THEIR POLITICIANS WILL DESTROY OUR CONSTITUTION AND COUNTRY....  WE HAVE PATRIOTIC AMERICANS IN GOVERNMENT LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP AND TED CRUZ TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS, BUT IT CAN NOT BE DONE WITHOUT THE MILITARY....
Biden should make a debate conditional: Only after Trump releases his tax returns and the results of a drug test.
BREAK THE WILL, BANK ACCOUNTS, AND SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IS THE GOAL OF THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN AMERICA....  SO FAR THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING THEIR GOALS....  BETTER HOPE AND PRAY, TRUMP AND THE MILITARY OUST THE TREASONOUS TRAITORS NOW.... BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE....
dear Joe. You seem to have forgotten the first half of the sentence. Just to jog your memory here it is. President Donald J. Trump- ‚ÄúI think that, at some point, that‚Äôs going to sort of, just disappear, I hope.‚Äù
ONE PATRIOTIC CONSTITUTIONAL AMERICA.... WITH TRUMP AS PRESIDENT....   WOULD MAKE AND KEEP AMERICA, THE MOST PROSPEROUS AND POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH....  DUMP THE TREASONOUS DEMOCRATS, SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.... INSTEAD OF CONSTANTLY GOING IN CIRCLES, AND MOVING BACKWARDS....
What is Ducey going to do to appease Trump this time? The last time he opened up the state too early and put us in this predicament in the first place. This also comes two days before Ducey is due to release benchmarks for reopening schools.
This is where Trump flips over the checker board.
So, you‚Äôre saying, he needs to take a trump?
Far out! Trump playing "Cowgirl In the Sand" at his July 4th Mount Rushmore event just about put me over the edge.
"Us and Them," Trump's motto.
Same here. Trump is impaired. He's getting worse. I noticed the one graph handout during the interview was in color and enlarged for him. His staff knows he can't grasp the material. #25thAmendmentNow
Trump has cognitive impairment. #YoSemites
Here's a great synopsis of Jonathan Swan's interview of Donald Trump. The Gaslighter-In-Chief frequently says to the interviewer, when presented with facts: "You don't know that!" Oh yes, you pathologic liar, we do know.  #AxiosOnHBO #JonathaSwan
Trump has no idea how ridiculous and uninformed he is. And that thing he constantly does with his hands during interviews is so aggressive and defensive, all at the same time. I wish we could see "after the interview" footage.  #AxiosOnHBO #JonathanSwan
Your procrastination and allegiance to Trump have brought us to this day. You both see everything in terms of blue states, red states, and what's best for the corporations. Shame on you for letting millions of Americans suffer. How's your aluminum plant? #COVID19 #stimuluspackage
A president who loved others would tell all Americans to vote by mail. Why?  To save lives from this virus on voting day in November.  He only knows how to cheat and lie.  Soes Donald J Trump loves anyone more  than himself?
You mean Trump won the presidency in the same manner all other Presidents have.
Haven't the Democrats pissed off all the Unions or are they claiming Trump is trying to destroy the USPS
If virginia is competitive, Trump's already won
THINK about this, is Donald Trump - who wants to protect Americans from this virus, doing the right thing, by wanting every voter to vote by mail?    NO, he is not.   WHY?
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CAN WEATHER THIS STORM FINANCIALLY, HOW FORTUNATE YOU ALL ARE...  FOR ALL YOU HARDWORKING PEOPLE RAISING FAMILIES THAT DON'T MAKE ENOUGH TO SAVE FOR THESE TIMES...  WELL, ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU IS PRAY THAT TRUMP AND THE MILITARY GETS AMERICA BACK ON TRACK...
AMERICA IS NOT READY TO BE BURIED YET....   NOR IS AMERICA UP FOR SALE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE....  DUMP THE DEMOCRATS TODAY, YESTERDAY WOULD BE BETTER....  TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, FREE, STRONG, AND PROSPEROUS....   STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP....
WE BETTER START SEEING PRESIDENT TRUMP, AS THE REINCARNATION OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, AND SUPPORT HIM 100%....  OUR REPUBLIC'S SOVEREIGNTY AS A NATION, IS WAY OFF COURSE....   THE TREASONOUS DEMOCRAT TRAITORS MUST BE REMOVED, AND LAW AND ORDER RESTORED ACROSS AMERICA....
President Trump takes Marine 1 and lands on his back yard.
TWO GOVERNMENTS FOR ONE COUNTRY DIVIDED, IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN....  NOW IT IS HAPPENING, AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM....  TRUMP, AND THE MILITARY ARE THE ONLY SOLUTION, TO STOP THIS SOCIALIST/COMMUNIST MOVEMENT....   NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE CALL IT....
The trump name will become synonymous with failure, idiocy, and weakness. That will be your legacy.
actually I was a huge skeptic of Trump and really angry about that "Grab her Pu55y" comment. But then I learned about his ability to shoot Syrian airbases and ISIS 100 miles out, so I became a huge fan. So 2020 for him, he wins big. Wanna make a bet?
Trump is off the rails.
Exactly. And Trump just told us that the Towers have not fallen. #TrumpPressConference
Treason is being committed right before our eyes! I seriously think Trump's bogus plans for the Rose Garden and West Wing are, in reality, his (and Putin's) designs to reinforce the White House with walls, fences, and surveillance equipment. No joke. #TraitorTrump #TrumpRussia
We are under attack from within. I have absolutely no doubt that Trump's non-response to the pandemic is intentional. It's clear as day to me now. I probably won't sleep again tonight. #TrumpRussia #TraitorTrump #PutinsPuppet
Perfect cover for not sending badly needed #Covid19 resources to states and local governments. More money for the Rose Garden and the West Wing remodel. This is all starting to look highly intentional. Trump is killing Americans. #TraitorTrump #TreasonousTrump
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE THE USA A JOKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD....  TRUMP, MUST HAVE HIS HANDS UNTIED, AND ALL THE DEMOCRATS REMOVED NOW....  THE DEMOCRATS AND TURNCOATS, HAVE MEDIA POWER AND $$$$, BUT ARE WEAK AND THEIR POLICIES ARE A DISASTER....   DUMP, THE DEMOCRATS NOW....
THE MEDIA SHIFT WITH THE DEMOCRAT ESTABLISHMENT'S PROPAGANDA AGENDA, CAME IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND WAS FINALIZED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION...   THE MEDIA IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL OF COMMUNISTS WORLDWIDE TO CONTROL SOCIETY...  ONLY TRUMP, AND THE MILITARY CAN STOP THIS...
THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA... SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A STRONG BUSINESS BACKGROUND OF PROVEN SUCCESS.  WE HAVE THE MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENT, THAT AMERICA COULD EVER DREAM OF HAVING, IN PRESIDENT TRUMP.  DEMOCRATS ARE DESTROYING AMERICA, AND NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM OUR GOVERNMENT NOW.
Anyone and any company who fund Donald Trump share this in common, they are just like him.  Frauds, Liars, Cheaters, adulterers and hypocrites.  What hope does our constitution and freedoms have?  Not much... Mussolini, Putin &amp; Hitler &amp; Trump are their heroes.
Trump is the enemy of the people
Timeline of Trump‚Äôs Creepiness While He Owned Miss Universe ‚Äì Rolling Stone
Is that the only thing Trump said? Or is that just the one you want to hang onto?
Trump Has Destroyed U.S. Foreign Policy. His Only Goal Now Is Foreign Help for His Reelection.
WITH TRUMP AND THE MILITARY, IT WILL BE SETTING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC BACK ON LINE....  THE DEMOCRATS OVER SEVERAL DECADES, HAVE DERAILED OUR SYSTEM, AND WE NEED TO RE-BOOT THE SYSTEM, LESS THE DEMOCRATS CHANGES....   REMOVE THE DEMOCRATS NOW FOR TREASON....
I TRULY HOPE I AM WRONG....  I THINK BARR IS A BUSH BOY, AND THE DEMOCRATS QUESTIONING HIM, WAS JUST A PLOY....  THE ONLY HOPE, IS FOR TRUMP AND THE MILITARY, TO SAVE THE DAY FOR ALL OF US....
Daniel Goldman (Former Lead Counsel, House Impeachment Inquiry). He would get answers from Trump.
Trump hates this photo.
I heard on NPR that Trump's goons are still there, living in hotels, low key hiding.
fuck trump them bitches racist
Trump's Germany troops pullout may be his last gift to Putin before the election
no if trump isn't reelected it will be because of the power of Andrew Yang's campaign
My bad, the tweet I saw earlier had this photo attached, implying it was taken today. That Newsweek article was interesting. Somebody should tally up all of the costs of Trump's golfing excursions.
Gov. Ducey stopped listening to his teachers, sups, parents, and scientists.  He has been a Trump lackey.  I‚Äôm an Arizonan and there is a catastrophe in the making.  I fear for our families in this state.  I lay it at DeVos‚Äô feet as well.
Here's a recent example of Trump's secret police in action, in California.
I think one of the reasons Trump goes to his private golf clubs so often, is because he makes calls to Putin from there on his personal cell phone. I bet Secret Service would have stories to tell, if they could talk.
Trump wants to see how far he can get with his use of secret forces. They are all over this country, as we speak. And no, I am not a conspiracy theorist. Trump is gearing up. I totally agree with Rep. Clyburn - someone Trump has been targeting lately.
I kept waiting for a real answer from Dr. Birx during this excruciating interview. I know now that "Why" will never be answered, because she doesn't really work for us. She works for Donald Trump. Her job is to make him look good, while Americans die. #PandemicResponse #COVID19
I wonder how much it costs each time Trump goes golfing. Check out all of the Secret Service and all of their golf carts today in Virginia. Trump charges the American taxpayers for all of it. Disgusting. #TrumpIsLosing
The entire, inept Trump Administration is standing and watching this growing fire burn out of control, while skewing the data and leaving states to fend for themselves. The Vanity Fair article does not paint Dr. Birx in a good light. #PandemicResponse #Covid19
Stop whitewashing QAnon into a banal conspiracy theory that believes that Donald Trump is going to take down the deep state pedophiles.  It specifically claims JFK Jr is still alive, Debbie Wasserman Schulz got MS-13 to kill Seth Rich, all mass shootings are faked, etc
For how long now has Trump &amp; advisors wondered how a virus spreads between people?  The virus does not fly.  Feeding it more humans was not a good choice by Trump or advisors.  TikTok is now their enemy - another example or Trumps self serving job skills
Imagine trump permanently allowing your free speech.. Oh wait..this is why we are here. He supports it more than you.
He‚Äôs not a Christian, he‚Äôs a trump evangelical.
IF WE PRAY HARD TONIGHT AND TOMORROW, FOR AN END TO THIS DEMOCRAT MADNESS, AND CONTINUED REAPING OF THE AMERICAN DREAM BY DEMOCRATS...  MAYBE GOD WILL HELP US THIS WEEK.... BY HELPING TRUMP AND OUR MILITARY, DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE TRAITORS...  A DREAM, THAT MUST COME TRUE...
You do know that trump and Epstein were best friends, right?
I think the GOP and RNC are trying to avoid the public humiliation of thousands of empty seats in the convention hall. They don't want it to be televised. It might look like the low turnout for Trump in Florida yesterday.
I love trump.
Trump is hawking books and beans from the Oval Office, and Lindsey Graham just announced his support for a corporate takeover of TikTok by Microsoft. Who's to say you can't make a fortune while you're in office?  This is America! #HatchAct #TikTok
Millions of Americans are proud William Barr is the Trump families new fixer.    Only White Live Matter in their world for who knows what reason.
The sad part of AG Barr being Trumps new fixer is our nations future.  William Barr's arrogance tells honest Americans he is extremely PROUD to be the Trump Family fixer. To protect the Constitution and American Oath of Office he took makes him what?
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT OVER THE LAST 150 YEARS IS AMAZING, COMPARED WITH PAST TIMES....  LOOK AT US NOW, AND THE MESS WE ARE IN.... SCIENTIST ARE TRYING, BUT ARE DIVIDED WITH TREATMENT AND POLICIES.....  GET RID OF POLITICS, AND LET TRUMP AND THE MILITARY GET US BACK ON TRACK....
YES, AND SO DO THE DEMOCRATS THAT CONTROL OUR GOVERNMENT....   CRIMINALS PROTECT CRIMINALS.... THE DEMOCRATS LAWS PROTECT OTHER CRIMINALS....  WE NEED A CLEAN SWEEP.... STAND WITH TRUMP, AND PRAY HE GETS FULL MILITARY SUPPORT....  THE DEMS COMMUNIST TAKEOVER MUST BE STOPPED....
Please address the use of secret police forces by the Trump administration.
While Trump golfs and Mark Meadows lies, the eviction moratorium has ended, and supplemental unemployment benefits are gone, for millions of Americans in dire straits.  #EvictionCrisis #COVID19 #PUA #HEROESAct
IT IS TIME FOR TRUMP AND THE MILITARY TO TAKE TEMPORARY CONTROL OF THIS NATION, UNTIL FULL ORDER RETURNS AND THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY IS OVER...   CONGRESS IS DESTROYING OUR NATION...  SEARCH-OUT AND REMOVE ALL TRAITORS FROM OUR GOVERNMENT AND THEN RETURN TO THE ELECTION PROCESS...
WE DON'T WANT TO DIE....  ONLY DEPRESSED PEOPLE, OR PEOPLE TAKING ANTI-DEPRESSANTS WITH SUICIDAL SIDE-AFFECTS MAY NOT WANT TO LIVE....  STILL WE NEED TO LIVE A LIFE WORTH LIVING AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE KILLING US...  TRUMP AND THE MILITARY MUST REMOVE THE POWER FROM ALL TRAITORS...
Remember when Trump insisted on keeping his personal cell phone when he first took office? I think he calls Putin from his private golf club. Perfect set-up. #TraitorTrump
Trump gets high on Air Force One. Flying out of Florida....
Who is trump going to pick? I heard that Nikki Haley was in the running.
I would bet $100 that with in a few feet of tRUMP that day, there was, person, woman, man, camera, TV.
Why isn't this VP choice obviously a two (wo)man race?  Kamala Harris is the candidate you pick if you think the campaign needs energy.  Tammy Duckworth is the candidate you pick to do no harm (and maybe bait Trump).  Rice, Bass, Demings are all objectively bad picks.
Trump‚Äôs Unfitness For Office -
A LOT OF US DON'T HAVE MUCH, BUT WANT TO KEEP WHAT WE HAVE.  THAT INCLUDES, OUR FREEDOM AND LIBERTY THAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO TAKE FROM US, IN A VERY TREASONOUS FASHION.  THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NO MORALITY AND THAT MAKES THEM WRONG FOR AMERICA.    STAND WITH TRUMP, AND SAVE THE USA.
Let the Angels guide Trump and our nation, out from the clutches of the treasonous cult of Democrat deceivers...
JUST BECAUSE DEMOCRATS FEEL LAWLESSNESS IS OKAY, DOESN'T MEAN IT IS....  WILL THE MILITARY AND ALL OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT JUST DO THE RIGHT THING, AND STAND WITH TRUMP....  THE DEMOCRATS HAVE COMMITTED TREASON, AND MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT NOW....  WHO WANTS A DEPRESSION....
THE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE IN TRUMP IS EXACTLY WHO ALL OF AMERICAS NEED RIGHT NOW...  HALF OF US KNOW THAT, AND THE OTHER HALF OF AMERICANS ARE NAIVE FOOLS...   SOMETIMES FOOLS NEED TO BE GENTLY PUSHED ASIDE, WHEN POSSIBLE TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT...  DUMP THE DEMOCRATS AND SAVE AMERICA...
Trump says he‚Äôll act to ban TikTok in U.S. as soon as Saturday  #SmartNews
It really isn‚Äôt the time for us to pick the running mate apart.  The goal is to defeat Trump in November.  We can do that best by being united.  There will be time after the war is won to sort out concerns.
Hogan is Governor of Maryland, Mary most likely is author/cousin Mary Trump, Karl is probably Karl Rove, and Absurd is the whole dang deal.
This photo has a foreshadowing aura to it. Storm clouds loom over Trump....
They certainly punished Morey for taking a side, which is again very bad! But no different from Trump's bullshit neutrality. And yet Josh Hawley is attacking LeBron and not Trump, because the crime is not the stance it's the hypocrisy.
If trump is against it, you have to know it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
One of the tabs in her binder says, "Goya." Another tab is labeled "Lies." Beans and Lies - The Trump White House.
I think Trump is terrified of losing because it will mean that Putin will be done with him. What then? Is he signaling for Russian interference? He's probably more than willing to work as an asset for four more years. He's safer in the White House, all the way around.
Too late now to start pretending to care about Democracy, Republicans. You had your chance to do that last year when you failed to remove Trump, despite the evidence. Now we've seen your true colours, and no one who truly values Democracy is going to vote for you. #yourefucked
Noteworthy that Trump is targeting one of John Lewis's best friends, the day after the funeral.
Been saying, surely someone asked for "Fuck Trump" or "Deez Nutz," right?
This article makes my blood boil. It's negligent homicide on a grand scale. Trump, Kushner, Pence, and Birx, et al. must be held accountable for this massive loss of life.
DESTROYING A PRESIDENCY FOR GLOBAL COMMUNISM BY DEMOCRAT COMRADES OF CHINA, RUSSIA, AND IRAN... BECOMES MORE OBVIOUS EACH DAY...  THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY OF WEALTHY AMERICANS, IS ABOUT TO ISSUE ITS FINAL BLOWS TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY...   WILL THE MILITARY STOP THIS???
Odds that Trump implies he might drop out of the race some time before the election?
Can't we just hear Donald Trump and Republican law makers whine if Obama was demanding election day to be  changed?
actually might have won 2020 if they had picked  but they picked a guy who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground so my tea leafs tell me: this is a pretty simple victory for Trump come Nov 2020,  ...
Let's get one thing perfectly straight,  here in  turf next week we're holding Primaries and I've registered thousands,   and Trump wins November in a landslide. And anytime  runs into the gutter  fixes fast.
Why? Was he forced by gunpoint to attend Trump's bs rally? Was he threatened with bodily arm if he wore a mask? Was he chained up in a closet with a bucket and no connection to the outside world apart from Fox News? He was an adult with access to the same info as the rest of us.
Herman Cain died of #coronavirus exacerbated by  inadequate response. And his #TulsaRally2020 appearance. Don‚Äôt forget #MAGA2020 #MAGA Some think #Trump should be immediately removed from office.
The Republicans actually vote, The Democrats are out on streets throwing ice bottles and rocks at  or tweeting hate from Mamma's basement. There, as someone with superpowers at tea leafs, Trump wins November in a landslide.
Wow so weird that something that makes Kushner look capable and smart and makes Trump look like a giant dumb dumb would leak to the media
THE ONLY DIVISION.... PRESIDENT TRUMP CAUSED, WAS TO DIVIDE THE TRADE UNBALANCE, TO MAKE SURE AMERICA RECEIVED ITS FAIR SHARE....   THE DEMOCRATS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE POLITICAL DIVISION, COVID 19 DIVISION, RACIAL DIVISION, MURDERS, AND NATIONAL WIDE DESTRUCTION....
Right! Voting for Biden does damn little to reduce harm. A Biden presidency is sticking a band-aid on the sucking chest wound of our social ills - As bad as more Trump but at least we did something!
FOR AMERICA TO STAY THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH....   AMERICA MUST REMAIN INTACT CONSTITUTIONALLY, WITHOUT CHANGE, OTHER THAN ENFORCING TREASON, FOR THE DEMOCRAT TRAITORS....  BEING THE MOST POWERFUL NATION GUARANTEES US OUR FREEDOM....  STAND BY TRUMP, TO STAY FREE....
Hey David, remember in 2016 they were accusing Donald Trump of this then. Who is it that could not accept the vote again? Any bets unless Biden is crushed the Democrats will do it again?
VOTER FRAUD IS UP AND RUNNING....   FIRST THE DEMOCRATS SOUGHT TO END, WAS THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.... THEN CHANGE BOUNDARIES, THEN THE CENSUS, THEN KEEP TRUMP OFF THE BALLAD IN DEMOCRAT STATES, AND THE LIST GOES ON....  MAIL IN VOTING WILL BE CORRUPT AS HELL...
No, no, no. Anyone who really thinks that will happen is delusional. Dropping out would require self-awareness, and the slightest grip on reality. Not to mention understanding of, and reverence for the Constitution. Trump has none of these.
ANY REPUBLICAN THAT SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATS MAIL IN BALLADS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION, IS PART OF THE SWAMP....   THE GLOBALIST COMMUNIST INFESTATION IN AMERICA, IS THE SWAMP, AND MUST BE REMOVED BY THE MILITARY FOR TREASON....   TRUMP, MUST REMAIN PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA'S SURVIVAL....
No uh oh about that. Trump still has it, Ducey has lost it,  ... you want to see a Pandemic? Yeah shut down businesses, Churches, Schools in Southern Arizona. I promise you: THAT will give you one. And I'm really getting tired of $50+ a day helping hungry neighbors.
If Donald Trump had to guess the population of the United States he'd be off by
My wife and I are going to vote for president Trump because he is doing things that should have been done a long time ago but as always people reject changes no matter how great they are THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP so sorry for the ones that are asleep
How will  the Epstein club members (Trump) explain the flight logs to Epstein's sex club locations?  (The list grows of planes)  These girls were paid little while Epstein's girl friend makes millions for her silence.

Trump says to delay election because of mail-in fraud. Election occurs 11/3 anyhow. Trump loses and blames fraud, refuses to step down while ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù. Widespread protests erupt. Trump stamps down. Shots fired. Shit hits the fan by Christmas 2020.

Anyone still supporting Trump seriously needs to be investigated immediately.   The donor list is a potential treasure trove of leads.  Birds of a feather flock together.
It happened in 2016, overload and disbelief.   Now it's happening again.   Trump really has created a shithole country, and these CaddyShack dweebs love it.  On masks, this is a peaceful protest of Fake News.  No masks, no distancing.  Loud message, liberate masks. It will go on

will Trump pardon him?
That‚Äôs just not true and the only one that says that is tRump.  You‚Äôre just selfish.
Worry about the hard Sanctions Trump put on them.  Joe will cancel those Sanctions on Iran &amp; maybe even give them another $ 1 Billion dollars like Obana / Biden did .   Just real facts &amp; Americans know You &amp; MSNBC will spin &amp; support Joe. China &amp; Iran
why are YOU Not talking on your Show about what China is doing to help Joe  Biden vs Russia / Trump ?   Is it Because  Hunter Biden is a employee of the Chinese Communist Army Party &amp; Iran is also working to get a Biden Elected &amp; then they can not have to
And Pence‚Äôs meeting w/ Ducey a week later had to be delayed after multiple Secret Service agents on the ground preparing for it tested positive. Never got confirmation if this is also why event was moved from Yuma to Phoenix less than 48 hours out.

President trump has really taught me the importance of knowing when to be serious and when to joke. I can‚Äôt wait to tell my kids the story of it all.
Trump is anti China until he gives millions of $$$s in bail outs to Chinese companies.
Trump said enough
I voted for the constitution party last time because I didn‚Äôt trust Trump and abhorred Hillary. This time, I‚Äôm more on board
Not if they're NOT legally allowed to vote and trying to play the system so their parents can fill their ballot out for them.  Do spout about anti democracy nonsense, if these people wanted their kids to vote for Trump youd be shrieking about voter fraud.
It might have been Buchanan I read about yesterday where Stone and Trump created a 3rd party.  I read something about this strategy yesterday.

Leave it to the left to try to find a way to excuse blatantly racist comments. If you know this man‚Äôs history, he meant what he said. Take step back from your liberal privilege and think about what would happen if Trump said this or asked a black man if he were a junkie.
Weissmann ran the "Mueller's" investigation, wrote the infamous public statement for Mueller, and wrote the report to smear Trump because he could not find or manufacture a crime.
Trump is down in the polls. The professor that predicted a trump win is predicting a Biden win. America trusts Biden with Covid and not Trump. Social media is cracking down on fakes and conspiracy theories. Trump is rambling incoherently and terrified.  WE ARE WINNING! #Biden2020

Funny how educated people would protest a republican all things considered. tRump said it himself is he loves the ignorant.
Let‚Äôs see, he plead guilty in a court of law and is only not sitting in jail because tRump dangled parsons and has his shill Barr reach in to tip the scales. It‚Äôs a criminal enterprise and even a blind person can see this. tRump and Barr are doing this out in the open.
Translation: why not have the moderators debate Trump while Biden stares off at a distance.

Brown person here: you know, my people called Obama the deporter in chief.  Obama singed off on: Indefinite detention Child separation Gassing migrants Mass deportations  Obama was Trump but smooth.
So, tRump is OK with mail in ballots in Fl.  I have to ask myself why. What BS are you and your cronies going to pull? Better not even be the appearance of rigging and all votes shall be counted. Non of this ‚Äúit‚Äôs taking to long so we‚Äôre going to have some judge call it for tRump

No, no he doesn‚Äôt Chuck and tRump needs to go before the election. I don‚Äôt know if Americans can hang on until we get him and all the repubs who enable him out of office.

Mueller's statement that Trump was not exonerated by this report was unethical, unprofessional, and a violation of DOJ policy; this was pure politics. Remember, if they can do it to him they can do it to you.
He said to Barr and Rosenstein (in front of other witnesses) the DOJ policy was not the reason he did not charge or consider charging Trump. He does not have the power to exonerate, he has the power to find violations of law and prosecute them.
To Trump, not finding a violation of the law, is exoneration. Mueller's statement on exoneration is unprofessional and highlights the corruption attached to the entire probe.
Here's one.
His office withdrew such statements later, as he had already told Barr and Rosenstein that he did not consider DOJ policy when determining to charge. Saying Trump was not exonerated violated basic DOJ principals as it's not his job to exonerate, only find violations; corrupt.
The Adults are under arrest, crossing the border at other than a port of entry is a felony. The minors have been separated since the 90s, Trump is simply the only one who got the blame and finally found a way around the mandated procedure.

That Trump is taking off my drug prices have gone down I pay less than 50% of what they were during the Obama Administration. So that tells you whis dwug prwices are coming down.  Americans are no longer paying for the Indigent at the pharmacy like we were with Obama.
Nice to see that hate it what drives you. Thanks to dumbocrats 90% of America is on lock down as you cheer it on just to blame Trump, who had nothing to do with it.  The silent majority will rise up Nov 3rd...
Oh, the irony of a Trump supporter calling someone else a sheep is fucking hysterical.
Republicans are telling their voters to vote by mail.  Come November 15th trump will claim that his voters didn't have their votes counted because the Post Office didn't get the ballots delivered on time.  Another trump created crisis then complain about the problem he created.
You know it‚Äôs real simple just say don‚Äôt open the schools. This woman should be put in jail for her negligence in her position along with Trump.
I was forced to watch Trump's Texas speech.  He claimed he created thousands of new energy jobs for Texas.  The new energy jobs in Texas have been in wind power.  Texas leads the country in the production of wind power.
Jake, why doesn't Trump just declare these protests That way you guys would get off his back.
You are laughable. Obama told Russia "Putin" I'll be more flexible in my next term. Trump THE most harshest on Russia (PUTIN) as a businessman never reveals his hand. Enjoy your koolaid..
Is she talking about Trump?
Come at me with facts.  You lost an election you can't accept.  Trump's playing field has been so lopsided, everytime he gains ground you dumbocrats move the goal posts, yet he persiveers.
Nice to see another drinking that CNN Kool-Aid. No, you're the one who thinks Trump ran against Obama when it was Hillary Clinton that was running on Obama's failures/merits....

Trump is the least worried about the election it was the same b******* four years ago everybody said he was going to lose you was nowhere near in the poles and yet the Electoral College who has a brain elected him let's hope the same this time.
Why is it Republicans carry Flags proudly and Democrats stop on them and burn them Democrats are so unhappy go to another country because as Donald Trump says this is the greatest country in the world
I don't think Trump understands that we don't have national elections.  We have state elections.  Each state votes.  They send representatives to each State House in December to elect the President.  There are no elections where the Federal Government has any control.

Just imagine how wonderful it‚Äôs going to be when Trump wins by a landslide because of vote by mail. Or perhaps there will have to be a second round of voting because the voter fraud is so apparent and wide spread. Trump remains in office while Biden hides and hopes.

The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.

Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.

These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

a Racist pig.. and now ship full of ammonium nitrate float around the sea to bring it death to a Port  the vessel called ‚ÄúTrump D‚Äù
Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ
What B.S. Your lead should be that Trump is promising something that is already covered by Obamacare.
Trump is a jack ass and so are his golf members. They're all jack asses.

If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

It must be tough being a store window mannequin like you.    According to the Constitution, the DOJ should be going after your owner, Trump for impersonating a physician by giving treatment advice that he‚Äôs not qualified to give.  Fall fashions are on their way.

So now senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Chuck Grassley of Iowa are teaming up with Russia to spread negative information about Joe Biden. I am now convinced that Russia not only paid Trump, but that they paid every Republican in Congress. House and Senate. #Traitors

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Informed Christians will vote for Trump. We don't want a theocracy. We just want our freedoms and Trump's policies are doing just that.

B. As we‚Äôve seen with  #NortheastCanyons and #Seamounts, trump is more than willing to open up protected areas for industrial exploration, so trump does not get the benefit of the doubt. /2-fin
And Trump the virus is still occupying the White House.
Okay, now we can add rapist to charges against  we already know is a liar, traitor, racist and narsastic lunatic.  Judge refuses president's request to delay defamation suit brought by E Jean Carroll.   via
I'm saying it is a hell of a gamble to let Trump win and then *hope* you can remove him from office, then it is to elect Biden and then hope you can outflank him politically
I think I'm at the end of my rope with Trump, the GOP, and trumpsters!!! They ALL make me sick to my stomach!!!
I doubt there‚Äôs any accident in this. In fact, I bet the same reason accounts for the supposed drop in AZ positive cases of late. Team trump is not to be trusted and his minions are everywhere.
A. While  is a definitely a thing, mining is not an activity that is a vacuum. There‚Äôs this thing called called wind and these things called roads that surround it.  You can read more about trump‚Äôs willingness to entertain the idea. /1
No one here wants that POS anymore... we actually wanted him in jail, but tRUmp messed that up for us.
I would.
Trumptastic news!  Trump strips the AHA,  attempts to give back pieces,  sycophants spread the news, and  wants praise and adulation.    This IS the school yard bully stealing your jacket, getting off on watching you freeze, then giving it back expecting gratitude.  #ETTD
You're assuming, again, that Trump gets removed from office.  That's a *very* big assumption to make.
He taught his kids the same criminal activity his father taught him. They've gotten away with it because no one has ever looked into it.  If Trump under valued property to pay less taxes, they did as well. If he overvalued to get loans, so did they.  It's a family crime syndicate
No.... Trump fucked kids with Epstein closer to home.  In Palm Beach and NYC.  Why would I care if Dems are guilty, too?  They should all swing, along with Trump.
Even the very leftist msm is reporting this...
Donald Trump will say or do anything in order to attempt to sway the 2020 election. I‚Äôve found the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation regarding any news of Coronavirus vaccine trustworthy. Also my longtime professional relationship with a  physician informs me.
You say that, governor, because you have done a terrible job handling the pandemic because you followed Trump‚Äôs incompetent lead. What you ought to do is resign for failing us.
Trump swears all the time tho in front of children
The thread started with someone literally quoting Biden and posting a video of him speaking uninterrupted for 23 seconds.  You turned that into a Trump-bashing, which prompted my reply to you, as there was more than stuttering to fault in Biden's statement.  The rest followed...
üö®üö®üö®HUGE NEWSüö®üö®üö®  Trump is taking credit for what Barack Obama did 10 years ago! (And it's going to work because this country is irreparably broken.)
You're assuming that we'll still have elections at the end of a second Trump term.
It was a rally... only called a "press conference" so Trump could fleece American taxpayers
NOBODY would want to do the kind of job Trump has done with the #TrumpVirus  2+ million more cases than any other country in the world and 3 times the deaths of Americans in Vietnam War  #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER
Trump is a Putin puppet.
They need to change their focus. Go after the kids. No immunity. What involvement did they have while at Trump Org? Fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Indict the kids. The rest will crumble.
My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
You can't read, Biden!  Nobody has proposed mining inside Grand Canyon National Park  That said, as someone who worked at GCNP for several years, the old uranium mine near Powell Point was abandoned years ago because it was low grade  #Trump #Covid_19 #Testing #TX #AZ #Results
My heart and love go out to the family of this man.  And to all those, tbh, who suffer or die because  Gov Ducey has his head shoved so far up Donald Trump‚Äôs a**! RIPüôèüèΩ
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.
You've been dodging me repeatedly throughout this thread, as I've been discussing the original topic.  Somehow THAT'S OK, but if I don't let you cattle-prod me into changing the entire thread to a critique of Trump, I'M the one who is supposedly dodging?  A Yale tactic, Gordon?
Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
100 have died from hydroxychloroquine poisoning since Trump promoted it.
No wonder he was never upset about Trump!
We are giving China a slow death by thousand cuts. Excellent strategy that can minimize our cost of war against the evil! Trump is our modern time dragon slayer!

Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
Congrats trump supporters you played your self..
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.arizona plz stand up to trump he cant ruin our grand canyon
Swan‚Äôs interview of Trump on Axios is cool but have you ever listened to Kendrick Lamar interview Tupac on TPAB?
I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Had a conversation with an obvious Trump supporter. She complained that people have to get back to work that the U.S. is not a socialist country. She then complained about the lack of affordable housing for low income/homeless people.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
Hell yeah we are voting trump we need border wall in Arizona and deport all illegals!!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.
I think he meant to say "supporters" of tRump...
And you have been waging an anti-Trump campaign for 4 years.
This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
It looks like the big Bernie flips didn‚Äôt get what they thought Trump promised and are done with him.
Voting For Trump Is Going To FEEL GOOD, 2020 Might Surprise EVERYONE  via
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
The Steele dossier and Mueller Report contain strong evidence of Trumps crimes. Trump is not innocent, he‚Äôs not vindicated, not exonerated. The case against Trump is not closed. Trump will be prosecuted for his crimes.
Yeah your typical western evangelicals are on some cult level shit when it comes to Trump. They defend all of his trangressions and still believe he was called by god to make America great.....for......them.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Bob Mueller did a great job investigating Trumps crimes and publishing his report. Trumps people secretly met with Russians 100 times and lied about it to the FBI and to Congress. Trump will be prosecuted for his criminal activity with the Russians.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.
witness tampering and other charges.  Trump will imprisoned for years and years for his crimes.
Sadly yes and the reasoning was it‚Äôs a better choice then Trump I asked in what ways.... cricket cricket ü§Ø
Trump has been money laundering for the Russians for years. Trump will face multiple counts of money laundering, racketeering, bank fraud, fraud, attempted fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to commit fraud, jury tampering ...
I met some1 tonight at our weekly ‚ÄúTrump Friday‚Äù social that showed me all the key damage, dents from pellet gun and more damage because his license plate says TRUMPUS
this ice documentary has me so fucked up right now but it lit a fire in me to know what goes on every day while were at home watching tv not worried ... i would kill before they took my child from me ‚Äúimmigration nation‚Äù FUCK DONALD TRUMP
You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
Trump used Rudy &amp; . Lev Parnas to do his dirty work in Ukraine. That‚Äôs racketeering. He twisted the Ukraine president‚Äôs arm to interfere in our election. That‚Äôs election fraud. He‚Äôll be prosecuted for multiple counts of racketeering and election fraud. He be imprisoned for years
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Please pray for the millions of Americans who had their unemployment cut by 70% because  didn‚Äôt do her job. Very soon we won‚Äôt be able to feed our children, pay our bills, and keep our houses. Meanwhile Trump is golfing
I agree!   I  was invited to a Christmas party at the White House and  took a rain check for 7 years until some other President was there. The night President Trump was ellected, I called my daughter to clame my rain check.  and I had the best time in my life.
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
This a Trump trash type statement that is beneath the office he was elected to by the people of ARIZONA.   Shameful display of pettiness and gaslighting.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
The Dems siding with Trump again!
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

You can‚Äôt make my words mean what you want them to mean because I will never support Donald Trump. I will never support any man that talks about women the way he does. I don‚Äôt care what you think is great about him. You lose me at, ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre a star you can do anything . . .‚Äù
Poorer than trump‚Äôs daddy bought degree? Please!
Yes. Fact is, the constituency that elected Trump is still behind him, and it has grown. The media polls are designed to discourage that constituency, but we‚Äôre still fired up.
So much for the added value of a Trump pardon ü§≠
Trump failure. Repubs fail to agree on a plan. Americans are dying and out of work. The DEMS HAVE A PLAN. The Dems have unified bill and aporoach to help people. The Repubs REFUSE the bill.  The US is approaching 5 million coronavirus cases
This pretty much sums up the Trump Administration.
well it would be funny to have adult businesses only open in republican states just to show the divide between the two logic....and somehow they would blame trump..to funny
Trump campaign has two candidates. An INVALID ONE, and a FAKE POTUS
Attacked relentlessly for corruption and avoiding accountability for his actions..... kind of an important piece they left out because he‚Äôs fighting for himself, against these investigations into his conduct as POTUS.... NOT fighting for America  Donald Trump ‚â† America
Donald Trump is already doing that......... next, ho
The Repubs in the Senate are a mess. The Dems have a strong plan and a bill to help Americans. The Repubs refuse to help people. Period.Trump copies Obama.Repub party has disappeared.   Trump lays out planned executive orders after stimulus talks fail
Joe, please explain to us how you get credit for the growing economy, but not the blame for turning Libya into a bombed-out slave-market shithole.  If all you can do is have people script stuff for you linking you to Obama and bashing Trump, you're going to lose, and deserve to.
Amazon has nothing to do with it, Trump is jealous of Bazos end of story. Why he put one of his people in I‚Äôm not sure but I bet we‚Äôll find out.
Prayers now for our President Trump IJN Amen
I dont pay to much attention untill one month before the race . I can hear everything they say and have said then.
Shocker. Most trump fans on Twitter are bots
The next 3 months Trump, with enormous help from Russia, FOX, &amp; OANN will try &amp; demonize Biden &amp; his VP pick. They'll try &amp; get us to stay home. We need to remember that our whole democracy is at stake &amp; come out &amp; vote Blue down the ticket - Biden &amp; every Senate race!
The weren‚Äôt added they were closed for the virus and reopened  not added . Trump is just Stupid
Trump is losing it (even more than usual) His supporters carry that burden by trying to be even more aggressive and enabling. Fuck outta here. America is a progressive nation. We PROGRESS. We make PROGRESS. We become tolerant of things, we learn to live with other people.
So this may be where we all ask, is it actually Microsoft that‚Äôs the driving force behind the ban and possible subsequent forced sale of #TikTok, and trump is the enabler/puppet?
You sure point fingers at Trump but I'm still waiting to see what you will promise to do if elected for the next 4 years??? You have already had 36 years in politics and 8 years as VP. So if you didn't do much so those years, why would I elect you to do nothing next 4?
Nah. Leadership was President Obama doing it TEN YEARS ago. The opposite of leadership is Trump suing in court to eliminate the pre-existing conditions clause in Obamacare.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.
Yo Donny guess what? By Election Day your support won‚Äôt top 28% &amp; your sorry pathetic ass sinks. So don‚Äôt say you never heard that, OK? By March, all the remaining GOP in Congress will continuously repeat 2 words ‚ÄúTrump who?‚Äù
Agree. This is a tough one . I live in #MaricopaCounty and spent 2018-door knocking for #Dems . The Latino community has PTSD from horrible #Arpio and #Trump is worse. They are scared. Difficult to engage.

Trump!
I‚Äôm sorry but you chose to lose your freedom when you voted for #Trump. #PutinOwnsTrump
and yet, you still can‚Äôt show proof of trump-russia collusion..
Trump explained it was a peaceful protest to the Press at this PRESS CONFERENCE  Guess You Didn't Know That, Hilltards LOL
And btw, I have a student loan and got the notification when he suspended it earlier... payments and interest accrual are paused. Schumer was full of sh*t when he said we‚Äôd all end up owing more. It‚Äôs literally paused. Trump will extend that pause.
i would call myself a republican, and i used to not like you because you were a democrat, but the more i saw the way trump acts, and the more i heard you talk, i became more of a fan, make no mistake, i cant agree with you on stuff, but i hope you can get us out of this mess
So true David. And now they have the Tea Party guy Mark Meadows and Munichin doing the negotiating? The Repub Senators are in disarray.  They have no plan they can agree on. They are handing this to  trump.
Republican would like to See the postal service close down on Trump word becasue he want to cheat the election. And we all know there is NO mAil-in ballot fraud! And you can‚Äôt provide any proof
You tweet more than Trump
Absolutely. They are project Lincoln, not #VoteBlueNoMatterWho bcuz they hope to revive their party. They aren‚Äôt supporting our ideals. They are trying to get rid of Trump. Working w/ Reps to promote our ideals or win is different than giving money. Give to  #AZ08
Yes, something is very wrong. He has had his nose too far up Trump's ass. It's making him delirious.
Omg. Now trump suggests ideas that already exist in the Affordable Care Act and acts like these are new ideas????  "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions ‚Äî a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
I've already said that she does not represent me.  She reeks of Donald Trump.    I want you to represent #Arizona, you up for that challenge?
Wait. You guys dragged Obama for this when the ACA was passed. Now you‚Äôre praising Trump for it after it‚Äôs already law? WTAF?! Is the right going to Trump too now that he ‚Äúsupports‚Äù this? Doubt that

Do you really think that Americans are that naive and gullible to accept all the lies that team Trump spin? It seems to get worse and more outrageous as the election looms closer. All Americans must stand together and end this nightmare.
Right on. It's about time Trump is held accountable.
how is it that People hate Trump so bad that they are blinded by it, that they don't see Biden can't even breath a fully coherent sentence. This makes Biden more dangerous. Either way, if he wins or not won't change anything, it won't make bad people good again or stop violence
They know. They're counting on tRump supporters to be their usual idiotic selves and believe the bs.
Are you serious? We have had protections for pre existing conditions since Obama. Trump is currently in court trying to strip them away.
Can we allow this?
I believe this is happening due to rumors that the Trump Administration was going to allow insurance companies to impose pre existing conditions in their coverage again if Trump is elected.
Trump and the GOP truly believe the most dangerous threat we face is Tik-Tok...  Let that sink in  #TikTok
Trump is a big time Dick.
Trump really called Covid-19 ‚ÄúKung-Flu‚Äù üíÄ
What B.S. Your lead should be that Trump is promising something that is already covered by Obamacare.

Trump administration crooked without a conscience!!! They lie and break the laws in plain view!!!
Will the payroll tax cuts and trump‚Äôs executive orders move the needle at all in the polls and more importantly with helping workers and consumers?
In California, American pastors can get arrested for doing their jobs but illegal aliens get taxpayer-funded stimulus checks for being unemployed.  That will be the reality for all of America if Donald Trump does not win in November.

Alexa, define the Trump administration in 22 words.
If he was doing it the right way, he'd request legislation through Congress, instead of acting like a dictator and issuing an Executive Order. By the way, we already have this, it's called ACA and Trump hates it.

But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Of course China wants Biden. Can you see that dope at a negotiating table with China? Trump is an egomaniacal freak, but I trust his ability to negotiate trade deals. Unequivocally more qualified than Biden.

It wasn't China who ignored a pandemic, lied about it, called it a hoax, and did nothing about it for political reasons. It wasn't China who won't help the people with an adequate stimulus plan. It isn't China who won't do a rent and eviction freeze.  This is all on Trump.

Note to Dr Fauci,, that you stand next to Donald Trump making jokes about a subject you yourself have bastardized by often giving misleading information only designed to bolster the bully previously mentioned,  has NOT helped people make more informed decisions.
Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.

Trump is a Putin puppet.
They need to change their focus. Go after the kids. No immunity. What involvement did they have while at Trump Org? Fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Indict the kids. The rest will crumble.
BS like this only makes me more determined to get Trump elected........Corrupt haters like twitter and facebook give a voice to America and then censors what they dont want heard.
My former state, Illinois, has been in thrall to the Union-pension trap; Trump taking away their ability to have all of us pay (due to former deductibility of state/local taxes) exposed this. No reg politician could get that done. Bravo.
Would Democrats sue the President in order to reverse an executive order to extend  unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic?
Our democracy is dead unless we get trump and his supporters out of office.
Do you really think that'll be prevented by Trump having a second term, though?
You can't read, Biden!  Nobody has proposed mining inside Grand Canyon National Park  That said, as someone who worked at GCNP for several years, the old uranium mine near Powell Point was abandoned years ago because it was low grade  #Trump #Covid_19 #Testing #TX #AZ #Results
My heart and love go out to the family of this man.  And to all those, tbh, who suffer or die because  Gov Ducey has his head shoved so far up Donald Trump‚Äôs a**! RIPüôèüèΩ
So basically we have a telsa vs edsison sitch here where obama did the work and now trump is trying to take credit after the fact...its the inherited economy all over again.

You've been dodging me repeatedly throughout this thread, as I've been discussing the original topic.  Somehow THAT'S OK, but if I don't let you cattle-prod me into changing the entire thread to a critique of Trump, I'M the one who is supposedly dodging?  A Yale tactic, Gordon?

Independent thinker?  King of an oxymoron don‚Äôt ya think? You are the complete opposite and have been blinded by your hate for Trump because of all the lies you‚Äôve been fed like a sheep.
Fine, but if your other response you were referring to actually answered my question in that tweet, I didn't see it.  I didn't "diagnose" Biden, while you DID post a diagnosis of psychiatric and other mental disorders Trump supposedly has.  The thread MUST be about Trump-bashing.
The past 4 years with Trump has been a nightmare, a disaster.  Trump‚Äôs causes so much damage to our Country. It will take many years for us to recover.
I'm with China and Iran on this one.  U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump

Because BLM had nothing to do with the number of tests available, the length of time we are still waiting for results or the fact that masks weren‚Äôt mandatory from the beginning. Many in BLM wore mask - not so at Trump‚Äôs rally.
Congrats trump supporters you played your self..
You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
I don‚Äôt disagree. I think part of what endears Trump to his supporters is his casual, politically incorrect nature. My point is simply that there‚Äôs a huge difference between misspeaking &amp; being deceitful. But regardless of what the standard is it has to be applied evenly.
Trump is responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans. Trump should be prosecuted for murder.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.

Actually I don't like Trump either lol try again
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Like everything else I guess  Trump turned opening schools political. But of course it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about safety and nothing more. I can‚Äôt imagine after is political. They are kids and teachers and staff and when we know it is safe they go back. Why is that an issue
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.
Imagine being so ignorant, and stupid that you think this is about Trump. It's about my country, Trump is just the person in charge right now.
Fred Trump‚Äôs idiot son Donald is a traitor to America. FredTrump‚Äôs moron son Donald is a mass murderer. He is responsible for 160,000 American deaths. Fred‚Äôs dumb son Donald is a puppet for Putin. Putin pays to have American soldiers killed &amp; weak Donald does nothing. TrumpVirus
He is as heartless as Trump

What does that even mean?  You left the vast majority of your Twitter 280 unused in the process of posting a three-word tweet that is ambiguous at best.  Can you do ANYTHING besides bitch about Trump?

Yep, and Trump is going to weaponize that report that came out tonight: ‚ÄúChina wants Biden, China wants Biden!‚Äù.
Definitely not, it's actually far worse. Start with over 160,000 dead due to Trump's inaction. Huge Federal debt, escalating crime against racial minorities, massive unemployment and reduced living conditions are just part of Trump's legacy
Is she Trump's personal physician, or even a physician at all?  What's your point in bringing her up, apart from a "sling all the mud you can at the wall, and hope some of it sticks" tactic as part of trying to divert every discussion into a referendum on Trump personally?
I wish people would stop telling me to vote for Biden just because they don't want Trump to win, that's not going to make me want to vote for the 1st time. I get it but Biden really ain't shit either
so wait Trump's press conference was to announce that he's signing an executive order to guarantee something that the affordable care act already guarantees? what?

It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?

President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Trump did no such thing. He inherited a strong economy from Obama.   Suspension of the payroll tax will not boost the economy. Over 60% of benefit goes to top 20% of wage earners. It does NOTHING for those w/o jobs, and it causes revenue shortfall for Social Security &amp; Medicare.

Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.
LMAO Trump absolutely OWNS reporter asking abt lack of "following guidelines" in room  Room erupts in chorus of boos  He cites exclusion in law for political activity/peaceful protest  Bc "they knew u'd be here, they know news is fake"ü§£  Takes victory lap, drops mic &amp; leaves! üá∫üá∏

Trump's EO also introduces new government programs like Medicare Part D, CHIP, the EPA, and the First Bank of the United States.

Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.

61 mil tested oh and your other talking point Trump signed EO requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions..  So try again Chuck
Trump pardoned him
See what I'm saying. We are leaving the cards in his hands. We need to make our hand stronger. He's going to deliver our issues if we don't. It's all about winning for him, whatever it takes. Some for McConnell. Why he gave go ahead to distance from Trump.
Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.

üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ all I‚Äôm saying is that without compassion and empathy for others we are destined to fail. Trump, and to a larger extent, Fox News are trying to divide us with fear and hatred. We can‚Äôt let that happen.
I do like that many DC reporters, after totally watching "Pen and Phone" and "Prosecutorial Discretion" blow by, have decided to swing at "Trump Can Do COVID Aid by Himself"
1. You are a bad person 2. Despite the decisions they made, that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre justified.   You‚Äôre doing the same crap Trump does: justifying your terrible actions by pointing out the terrible actions of others.   Your days of comfort with 0 accountability are over.
Certainly  and  have the right to criticize  but shouldn‚Äôt they show this presser with trump talking about cutting payroll taxes, extending unemployment benefits, eviction protections and student loan deferments. Shouldn‚Äôt they show some of it?
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
Yes. I understand. My best background is documentaries.  Friday's are popular for Trump to dump major things to try to control the weekend narrative.  Turns out, seems he just wanted to flex and get some attention.
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
So DINO who's running against Mitch McConnell is using Trump talking pts! Dems are totally Repubs now!
Then BLAME the DEMOCRATS for making a DEAL with RED CHINA to kill AMERICANS to get TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE. Because that's what happened. Also BLAME RINOs for losing the 2018 midterms and screwing AMERICA.

Trump 2020
I watched a  coronavirus commercial on Wednesday with my brother, and you know what? They said to social distance and stay away from crowds and wash your hands, but what was missing? NO PLEA TO WEAR MASKS. This is what Donald Trump has done.
You actually have absolutely no way of knowing this.  But we do know how disastrous Trump has been.
President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Listen, I know you‚Äôve got a huge lady boner because trump liked one of your tweets or something but your tweets are incongruous with the degree you say you have.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  WowSwan‚Äôs interview of Trump on Axios is cool but have you ever listened to Kendrick Lamar interview Tupac on TPAB?
I can‚Äôt believe a man with no postal service is running the USPS and fired his experienced top people. Welcome to Donald Trump‚Äôs America- where anyone with bucks who can kiss Trump‚Äôs butt can do anything they‚Äôre not remotely qualified to do!
Clearly a Trump supporter.
Sadly I do know a few. But I‚Äôm working hard to change their minds. But honestly, it‚Äôs President Trump that is getting their attention. Most of them like what he‚Äôs been doing / saying the past month.
Fewer Trump voters come election time!!!
You are a disgrace to America, your family, the entertainment industry, and your race. There is enough unrest in our country without you pulling this crap. You deserve to be completely blackballed!
The real problem with Trump taking over the post office isn't their being able to deliver the ballots to the ballot box. It's whether they be delivered to the voters in the first place. Their goal is to keep ballots out of voters hands in the first place.
I‚Äôve never understood opposition to the wall. I get hating Trump. I get hating Republicans. But hating the wall is literally just embracing chaos and lawlessness.

This thread is about the comparison of the Millions more in taxpayer money spent at Trump properties versus the amount he allegedly donates.   You keep bringing up stuff that has nothing to do with this thread, that's highjacking.
Boy! These people are so corrupt. Comey was right when he compared Trump to a Mafia don.
Only the Lord knows for sure but I have a strong hunch Trump will emerge victorious.
Neither Biden or Trump. I vote on myself. I won‚Äôt rely on a white Supremacist to do a darn thing for me or my people.
The last thing we need is another politician ignoring a pandemic bc you‚Äôre excited that Trump paid attention to you. I lost my dad today bc you are weak and care more about yourself than our community. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre termed out. But that won‚Äôt bring my dad back.

You people are so wierd they already are. And Trump loves communists leaders. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it. Trump loves commies but they are bad so let‚Äôs look away while he kisses their butt.
These are the people Trump hangs with who give him advice &amp; seek favors. Biden hangs out with Americans who are actually struggling: workers, teachers, nurses, small business owners, factory workers, farmers, postal workers, vets.
Trump really is just killing democracy faster than an foreign enemy.
Trump should know this.  Is he suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment?
Trump teases order requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions - He must be suffering from Dementia or some other mental impairment.
While we clutch our pearls, trump continues doing what he does best. ‚ÄúMerchandising ‚Äú( must be said with Mel Brooks voice).  And cheating. There is NO substance, anywhere.  Ever.   (But substance is apparently irrelevant in a post-truth world.)
That's a lot of taxpayer money being spent at Trump properties, that he profits from.   Trump takes lots of breaks and lots of vacations, the point of the entire thread was that he is making more than he is donating.

Trump is losing it (even more than usual) His supporters carry that burden by trying to be even more aggressive and enabling. Fuck outta here. America is a progressive nation. We PROGRESS. We make PROGRESS. We become tolerant of things, we learn to live with other people.
They know trump supporters are that stupid. That‚Äôs who this is directed at, which is kinda silly since trump already has their votes. Maybe they‚Äôll capture a few more dummy‚Äôs though.

Ducey sucks and Trump complementing him as we are out of work shut down and muzzled is a bit insulting.
If you‚Äôre a Trump supporter, you know this is covered under Obamacare, right? Or are you willfully ignoring that. Either answer is fine, I‚Äôd just rather people be honest
But the ballots will still be mailed and filled out and returned against him. What it shows most clearly is Trump‚Äôs utter desperation. He knows he‚Äôs going to lose and so has nothing to lose. But it‚Äôs only cementing the result.

#grandcanyon Trump's don't care about the environment, animals or our Earth at all. They don't even care about people, so it kinda makes sense they wouldn't care about things MOST NORMAL HUMANS would deem important and cherishable. Get those robotic weirdos out of the WH.

They're both right.  Republicans who still hold onto the possibility of unrigged elections are worried.  Republicans who are comforted by knowing that every stop is being pulled to ensure a Trump victory (or continuation of power) aren't worried.
The Trump family are corrupt, unfeeling &amp; care nothing about the USA, our planet, or animals.  His two sons have killed tons of them. Not in the wild though. They paid BIG MONEY to kill them in a fenced in "hunting preserve" where they had no chance.
I would get in line right now and wait in line until November 3rd to vote against Trump.
I just love this country. Trump has actively tried to get rid of Obamacare... Which requires insurances cover people with preexisting conditions. Now he is taking credit for something aleady happening, that's he's trying to get rid of.

Note to Dr Fauci,, that you stand next to Donald Trump making jokes about a subject you yourself have bastardized by often giving misleading information only designed to bolster the bully previously mentioned,  has NOT helped people make more informed decisions.
Biden has committed to selecting a woman as his rm. Looks to be between Kamala and Susan Rice. Either of them against Trump would be a massive improvement for Dems, particularly considering the current social climate.
I will not (and did not) vote for Trump. Biden, however, is not fit to lead. His recent racist gaffe and every other senseless, incoherent thing he says is evidence. He's 77. How can we possibly take his candidacy seriously?  Then a thought occurred to me.
Yea.  Means nothing.  Trump can‚Äôt control what these pieces of crap say. He has denounced people and organizations like this multiple times. You base your argument on this video with 100 people in it? Get real.  These people are evil.

(2) One of your specialties seems to be strawman arguments.  What did I say that remotely implied I would interpret a simple statement of support for Biden as "Trump-bashing"?  You spent most of the thread deflecting observations about Biden by overtly bashing Trump, though.
And as an addendum, if it‚Äôs not a thing, and since  liked your post, it should be a softball of a choice for him say ‚ÄúI oppose any effort by the trump admin to open  &amp; the protected area around it to uranium mining and will fight any effort to do so‚Äù.
This is simply another distraction Trump has manufactured to take people's attention away from the real issues.   Don't get squirreled out!   I can guarantee you that this will not be the last BS distraction coming from Trump. Tomorrow, it'll be something even more outrageous.

One of the many things I will never forgive Trump for is pardoning that asshole.

You're illustrating my point with that question.  YOU brought up Mary Trump in response to something irrelevant, then ducked my question about why you brought her up. You strawman every comment about Biden into a Trump endorsement, and try to re-frame the thread for your benefit.
The advice to Trump on how to fix it plus the words of praise for Haley and Pence definitely led me to think this was an effort to help him. Yes.
Yeah cause Trump made it better. You‚Äôre party is trying to destroy all of that.
Again, you keep talking about diagnoses and disqualifications, which is all strawmanning. The "whataboutism" is on YOUR side, trying to exempt Biden from any scrutiny because he deserves coronation simply for Not Being Trump.  Millions won't ignore the elephant in the room, dude.
It is possible, Trump and family, and cronies are making money off of all of the hospitalizations occurring from the COVID-19 pandemic. In my opinion, that could be one reason why Trump and the Republicans have not come up with a national strategy to stop the pandemic. Money.

Again, you keep saying "diagnosis" when I offered none, but YOU offered an irrelevant one on Trump from someone who never personally examined him as a patient.  My point was that Biden concluded his remarks, evidently satisfied with a statement even you admit was incoherent.

LOL The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration is currently arguing in a case before the Supreme Court to strike down that very law ‚Äî including its pre-existing condition protections.
Judge rules woman who accused Trump of rape can proceed with defamation suit
How does everybody not see that Trump wants to ban tick-tock because he can now use China as a scapegoat when he loses the election and blames the election interference on China. It's all smoke and mirrors and a big game to him
Really? How so. Trump is the President for 3.5 years and the debt exploded, unemployment doubled, 160k people died from a pandemic, the most deaths in the world by far. He's a con.  #Biden2020  #CountryOverParty
Exactly Trump is a disgusting person.
I think you missed a trump rally.
Trump is fighting for our constitutional republic to survive the demonic attack against those who hate America and against all odds I believe in in Devine providenceüá∫üá∏üôèüèºüòá‚ò¶Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ
I'm a local and laugh every time I hear about Arepiehole.  We actually adopted a greyhound, whose racing name was "trump clemency".  We call him scooter now.
Hmmmm....signed an executive order for a law that already exists. Trump supporters applauding, but wait.......
"Get out of your basement?" Are you really bringing up a fake statement based on photoshopped images? OMG, how embarrassing.
The GOP is dead, replaced by the National Socialist Republican Party bent on turning the clock back to 1841. They're heartless only interested in how much more money they can steal for themselves from whatis fast becoming the Late United States of America
Great! Now President Trump has a good reason to void the trade agreement and restart the trade wars! Time to stock up on popcorns to watch China CCP die from thousand cuts!
I‚Äôve been waiting for you to release your environmental policy since 2019, and you‚Äôve never once contradicted trump.   Prove me wrong!
He takes all credit that may get him re-elected.  Trump REALLY needs to be a one term worm.  #YouAreTheResistence
All this was done by Obama but you could not see it because you worked for company that hated Obama but loved trump lies and what happened they kicked your can out from fox irony
I really wish Fred DuVal would just apologize. I read the column before any commentary about it and was dismayed. It read me as though he is an active Trump supporter. And then to learn he is not supporting Marsh?
Breaking: trump invented Obamacare!
And yet, you do have to say it. If it‚Äôs up to trump and goons like Gosar, one of the Seven Wonders would become a polluted toxic waste site.
. and  will not stop donald trump from opening the #GrandCanyon for uranium mining.  #AZ07 #AZ09 #AZ #Arizona
Is this a Joke? The ACA that Trump is trying to kill in court already did that. What next Make them cover your dependents until they are 26.
You should be voting Trump. Take Obam out of your avi. Judgemental hag.
Trump should be charged with crimes against humanity for boarder children's prisons and lack action during the pandemic). Kelly Ann Conway, and each senator standing with trump should be charged as well... at least as an  accessory.  via
Maybe there is but whether or not there is or isn't Trump has to promote it as the Dem/Lib's narrative is that Trump will get rid of the pre-existing conditions safety net.
I asked if they have Q stuff, like QAnon. He said no (but his son was gonna pick up more stuff soon), but the guy understood who I was talking about! He'd heard of Q! I am not used to this! I mean, being around Trump supporters! I've been so quiet. It's been quiet for so long!
At first, I was afraid to walk over to the new road-side Trump t-shirt stand, but then all three of the OTHER people who got off the public bus with me went to the t-shirt stand, as well! We ALL ended up buying something! (lol, I was afraid they'd make fun of me.)
It was awesome....Trump 2020!
of the economy that has disincentivized Americans not to return work. A ton of business have closed and file bankruptcy due to COVID-19 Coronavirus. Larry Kudlow and the Trump administration is clueless and incompetent to the max.
Body Language ‚Äì Trump "Last time you see me for a while"
Does any body else find it funny lil jimmy has snarkey comments for anything trump or evangelical but has no time to comment on the most racist candidate for president in an entire generation?
President Trump Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, don‚Äôt know anything or have a clue about economics. The guy is incompetent talking about extending the $600 Federal Unemployment Benefits disincentivized people not to return to work. It‚Äôs COVID-19 Coronavirus and the total collapse
is a Big idiot who does nothing more than kiss the ring to appease Trump. I feel bad for all the people he suckers into thinking that he's any kind of a leader.
He's one of Trump's androids sitting on a pile of bribery cash, that doesn't care about lives of AZ residents!  Trump wanted the border states to be the most affected with COVID. That's how come he paid most of the Governor's like AZ, FL, TX, big money to not to a damn thing!
how about you contain/eliminate/defeat COVID 19 -trump virus-  very quickly before Nov 3, 2020.
Don‚Äôt waste your breath, Trump supporters will forgive him for anything. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a cult.
One more reason why Trump will be re-elected.  Pence Will Make a Campaign Stop in Wisconsin During the Democrat Convention While Biden Stays Home.
I couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere and tried Fox. Chicken Heir was scolding dems for not liking Kanye West. Said ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt think all black lives matter‚Äù. But anyway.. trump was just in a small corner.
How has Trump capitulated in China?  He has been supportive of Xi, and extremely critical of the CCP. Shouldn‚Äôt that be the correct posture if there is any hope of China breaking from the CCP?
so now were talking about ventilators?  How did we need these?  trump made a travel ban, and as we all know, that was the single greatest move in the history of the world ever?
How many people were killed in so called Trump‚Äôs America because he perpetuated conspiracy theories? That‚Äôs why the death toll became so high in the first place because there was no one leading America. And why we‚Äôre screwed, republicans are still refusing to care about Americans
I‚Äôm hoping trump will be in a prison cellü§ûüèæ
It is so much fun watching you Lefties. You never seem to get what Trump is doing/saying.Anyone should be able to follow along. Then you start your screeching. Trump says "the sky is blue." Lefties "LIAR, LIAR, LIAR!!!" "The sky has gray areas and little clouds." That's why we üòÇ
Trump taking cares of business! The very moment that career politicians, on both sides, started hating on Trump, I knew that he was going to be the best President ever. Boy has he not disappointed! 4 more years!!
It‚Äôs not about that all. The Dems are the ones playing hardball and politics. Trump is telling them to get a deal done or he will take care of the American people by executive order. If the Dems sue him over that then they were like horrible.
It's true, the govt is responsible. Trump crashed the economy when he ignored the briefings he was given on the virus back in January
God Bless and Protect our President  Trump Makes Cryptic Remark at Ohio Speech "I Have a Lot of Enemies This May Be th Pres Trump spoke to workers at a Whirlpool factory in Clyde, Ohio Thurs to tout his efforts to restore America‚Äôs manufacturing base
you mean china and india?  both doing better than us. china leaders and inda leaders seem to be much smarter and way stronger than trump. someone should vote out such a weak leader!
Trump is a disgusting Human who lies constantly and has a moral compass of a mob boss.
Well since Trump hates the Dems, how about I throw him an elephant üêò
Why does the Trump campaign this Americans are this stupid? Oh... this was for his base of supporters. Now I understand.
That‚Äôs why we love TRUMP!!
Yesterday New Jersey Hospitals / Today #Trump golf course... what is wrong with our society and humanity üî•üò¢üëøüíîthey just spent on everyone‚Äôs Grave that died of #COVID19
Not so sure this time. Tariffs/trade are the ones talked about but the US wants a system change in China. State Capitalism is winning over Corporate Capitalism/Wall St. The NeoLibCon Asia Pivot under Obama lives under Trump. The US fears China's BRI.
It's not a coincidence this comes after dismal Democratic numbers in the recent Primary. For all their talk of 'leading Trump by 150000000000+ points'... it's obvious DNC internal polling is telling them a different story.
So you admit Trump is losing. Incumbents that are winning don't want more debates. Why risk it?
He was called out by a reporter for people in room not following CV guidelines.  Trump said he was calling the meeting a peaceful protest and a political gathering so there was nothing to worry about.  Turned and left. BOOM!
When the democratic party elites choose a terrible candidate for president to run against Donald Trump, it doesn‚Äôt take many votes to siphon to keep Trump in office. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Just like con man Trump to Doug ducey  doesn‚Äôt practice what he preaches and of course people to get the virus and probably some die
Nearly 200,000 Arizonans have been infected and Doug Ducey thinks that his inefficient leadership is somehow a success story. If the Governor was as serious about his response to COVID-19 as he is about kissing up to Trump, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have over 4,000 dead in Arizona.
President Trump is rolling out the wonderful news he said he would!
Reporters need to remind trump his big idea to cover pre-existing conditions was already part of the OBAMACARE he‚Äôs been trying to destroy.
Fyi Trump just called her Bluff with his EO‚Äôs !!
So excited that President Trump is signing an executive order for pre-existing conditions must be covered by health insurance plans! #greatestpresidentinhistory  This is huge people!!!!
Who goes bankrupt first post trump? Kushner or trump himself?

Sweet Jesus. Yes. Yes, that is all we have.  That is the only stupid thing trump has ever said. There is no way I could find 1000 videos of him being the dumbass he is. Holy hell. But that Axios interview huh?
Call him in. Even though impeachment has passed, the American citizens deserve to know who trump is before voting again
trump supporters: THESE BLM PROTESTS CAUSED CASES TO SPIKE. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° trump supporters:
Fox seemingly cut away from what had been touted as a press conference at Trump's club in NJ that Trump seems to have invited club members to attend.  They had wine glasses and no masks and Trump then claimed it was a campaign event and "political" so no masks were required.
If there were credible allegations of child rape by Trump, you and I both know that CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC, NYTimes and all the rest would have no other headline or story, 24/7. You know this, dear.
Doug Ducey should be ashamed of himself- he‚Äôs partially to blame for the virus is getting out of control in Arizona &amp; I understand we need to keep Business open. Why do he allow conman trump to come to Arizona at a church with 3000 cult supporters with no masks
Trump's people are so dumb. He knows this because he is only slightly less dumb than they are. And he only cares that his dumb people think he is responsible for pre-existing condition coverage. It's the stupidity, stupid.
Uhh...  "Evanina also stated that Iran is seeking to "undermine US democratic institutions, President Trump, and to divide the country."
Your education is lacking! Trump banned travelers coming from China while all quid pro quo joe fingers was doing was saying the POTUS was a xenophobe &amp; Nutty Nancy was dancing around n Chinatown in February singing let them in, let them in!!! I'd say both Dems are #FailureToLead
Karen reports on Trump's presser.
Trump was masterful again tonight. He made Pelosi totally irrelevant and completely played her. If the Dems try to sue him over his executive orders they will look horrible, Which isn‚Äôt really hard to do
Wow, you have actual deep hatred in your heart for Trump, don‚Äôt you? Real hatred. That‚Äôs a grave sin.
Easy anybody but Trump
you see whats weird is how you at first said it was chinas fault,  but when faced with the reality that trump failed to protect us, then started to blame the cities that got sick.  I just wanna make sure i have what you are saying right.
Oh Schooley... open your eyes &amp; see the truth about Trump's incompetence &amp; criminality. He bungled the Covid19 crisis &amp; many people died that didn't need to. I call that a crime. üò∑

Trump, KUSHNER, DeJOY, DeSANTIS, DUCEY, KEMP, MEADOWS, MILLER, MNUCHIN &amp; Co., INTENTIONALLY allow COVID-19 to run rampant; let Americans bleed their savings dry; then foreclose like there's no tomorrow, making what they did in the Great Bailout appear as child's play.
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump.  I mean, how is this not illegal? Again!!!!
Don't hold your breath come November 3rd when the POTUS is reelected!!!  TRUMP 2020 #MAGA
We SHOULD be able to open schools, go back to work, go out to eat, return to normal life by now BUT... your administration's mismanagement of the #COVID19 has stunted our ability to do so. Do better &amp; listen to experts and shut Trump up!!!
Yeah but he's not the only one with concerns. Hasn't been for awhile. People are just only paying attention now because Trump's name is attached, because it would have to be, since he has to sign something.  It's like the one time he actually listened to intelligence.
Check out her feed. Literally any time trump tweets, she‚Äôs there. She has like 50k tweets and 99% are kissing his ass. She‚Äôs got a major crush on him and wants so desperately to be noticed. She‚Äôs a total sycophant.
Trump, KUSHNER, DeJOY, DeSANTIS, DUCEY, KEMP, MEADOWS, MILLER, MNUCHIN &amp; Co., INTENTIONALLY allow COVID-19 to run rampant; let Americans bleed their savings dry; then foreclose like there's no tomorrow, THROW THEM ALL OUT!

Oh I'm sorry, have you not been following the news lately Favs? News reporters (for the most part)? Dumb. Trump supporters? Duuuuuuummmb.
Gonna pull out my acoustic guitar and make the ugly Trump world disappear for about 2-3 hours.
üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ all I‚Äôm saying is that without compassion and empathy for others we are destined to fail. Trump, and to a larger extent, Fox News are trying to divide us with fear and hatred. We can‚Äôt let that happen.
I do like that many DC reporters, after totally watching "Pen and Phone" and "Prosecutorial Discretion" blow by, have decided to swing at "Trump Can Do COVID Aid by Himself"
The fact that the left isn't outraged and calling for immediate investigations into China &amp; Iran interfering in our election to HURT Trump is proof that the Russia hoax was never actually about "election integrity"  If they didn't have double standards they would have none at all
There it is. The Biden slam. So just another Trump Rally full of bullshit and funded by the taxpayers.
There is absolutely no information on China that was Putin Gaslighting Tactic ... Trump cabinet really thinks Americans are stupid
Trump is just a bad ass! He is so tired of fighting to get things done so he is just doing them himself.
Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
I am not an anti-Vaxxer by any means, however, given this administration, before I take a COVID-19 Vaccine, I want to see the results and the numbers first. With Trump, It's probably Bleach and Lysol masquerading as the real thing.

President Trump showered Governor Doug Ducey with praise for Arizona's handling of its COVID-19 outbreak during a meeting earlier this week. But Joe Biden and some local public health and medical experts don't think adulation is warranted.
Tune into President Trump‚Äô press conference.  Live NOW  Wow
Not according to trump. Per him, jobs are just being created all OVER!
Pure hell. Trump will be plotting to undo the election if he hasn‚Äôt already rigged it in his favor!

Trump says executive action would include a payroll tax cut that will go until end of year and be retroactive starting July 1

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
One other observation: You seem way to obsequious to the President.  He and his administration have botched this big time.  You really need to distance yourself from Trump before you go down with him.

Never. He will press (lie)  that it is below 10% in order to open schools so he can please Trump.
Nonsense. I live in Az. He mandated and enforced nothing. He has no plan to raise unemployment which is $240.00 a week. He will leave it to Congress. He wants federal "socialist" $ but spews state's rights. He is a lying Tea Bagger that kneels to Trump.

Governor of Arizona Doug Ducey is a tool and a boot licker for Trump. He is a complete failure that only thinks about his own future. He doesn't have the huevos to mandate masks and cherry picks (lies) on the data. He needs to resign.
It will be interesting to see how China reacts. They are already over the pandemic and are up and running. The US can't take a trade war hit and Trump knows it.

Trump 2020
It‚Äôs a good thing he wasn‚Äôt in the US; trump or kushner would have given mbs the address!
Just watched James Carhill on the Beat one of my favorite shows on MSNBC! I got the best feeling listening to you give Barr-fatter and babbling dumpster-fire trump hell bless your heart ‚ù§Ô∏è. The Beat was on fire üî•, let me give the show a hand üñê love you too Ari!
Doesn't the N in NRA stand for National? Is trump feeling okay today? Did he have another mini stroke?
Omg Trump is saying the vaccine will be ready 3 Nov. Dumpy Trumpy will say and do anything to get re-elected.    So wrong
He opened up Arizona without following CDC guidelines and caused these deaths. Trump hack #TrumpHasNoPlan
Does Trump have a Plumber Force that we‚Äôre not aware of? WTH?
You have to be fully entrenched in the Trump Cult to think remarks like this are even touching the edge of sanity.
Questionable.. probably. But no formal investigation. Trump is being investigated over tax and bank fraud. There's a paper trail.
Trump supporters don‚Äôt have the intellectual ability to understand this.
Fuck Donald trump fuck ICE
Post master is a Trump Hack
Governor Ducey the Trump boot licker is a complete failure who would not even mandate masks. He closed the state too late then opened way too early with no plan. But yet he kneels to Trump as the bodies pile up in the morgue.
people are crazy! Voting for fucking Biden?! What the hell! Even if you don‚Äôt like trump whatever the reason is you honestly want to see Biden as our president for the next 4years! think this country is fucked up now you wait till he gets a hold of it!üíôüñ§üíôüá∫üá∏Trump!
Biden is Not taking away your guns!!! Not defunding police!!!Not taking away religious rights!!Trump will lie fraud steal and do anything to get re-elected.   SHAME #NobodyLikesTrump
If he sees his shadow, do we get four more years of Trump.
If Joe can take down God, then he's a heavy favorite to knock down Trump.
And arizona is going down on infections cause of our mayors not our governor he couldnt even mandate the mask we didnt get everything our dr med staff needed either and the testing tract &amp;tracing govern ou r ducey failed that one too you failed trump
So, based on what Trump says, I assume you voted fraudulently, voted for a few dead people and immigrants, voted more than once.....right?
Because trump is too dumb to realize killing a bunch of kids and teachers/adults who work in schools is the worst thing to if he wants to be re-elected. Consider the timing of when we‚Äôll see this next spike in deaths related to school opening + the election. He‚Äôs done.
I really wish he was only trying to boost his fame..... but he is trying to split the votes, help Trump stay in office. It's really a crying shame if that foolishness works.
So Trump?
Sounds like Obama: "Tell Vlad I will be more flexible after my re-election."  Yet Obama allowed Russian interference he knew was happening and Trump has put Heavy Sanctions on Russia and beaten them on the oil/energy front.  You have swallowed too much Democrat Kool Aid.
I did but I exchanged it for a Trump resigning square

Martha McSally has shown little interest in Arizonans. In 2018 she lost in part because she lied about her position on pre-existing conditions. Now she claims she will always protect Arizonans with pre-existing conditions yet she‚Äôs silent on Trump‚Äôs request to invalidate the ACA.
Here we go New York never Trumpers prosecutors to make major announcement to President Trump past business financial issues. Democrats are making it a big boom finding. Look at America
Trump has no plan for anything.
Fully support draining the swamp. Getting the Trump family corruption out first seems like a step we should have taken already
Trump is loyal to nobody...well maybe Ivanka.
I‚Äôm not sure about anyone else, I became a Twitter user to follow President Trump. If Twitter suspended President Trump permanently then i will be cancelling my account.
Why is Joe‚Äôs wife, a doctor, displaying Joe‚Äôs in complement medical condition, it‚Äôs embarrassing for him and the Democrats party. Joe Biden will NEVER NEVER NEVER debate President Trump.
Hiw about 65 million Trump supporters viewership.
You can bash Trump, but numbers are numbers. Again, REGISTERED INDEPENDENT, trying to decide which asshole to vote for. Not debate party preference. They BOTH suck.

Trump continues to say the Covid19 virus will just go away. He has said this over and over since February. Omg 157000 dead and he saids "it is what it is". He just does not get it.  Help us please #Trump Virus #TrumpFailedAmerica
The real concern is what could happen in the electoral college. Let‚Äôs say Trump loses a close election in the EC. But, one of the battleground states he lost decides to annul the popular vote and pick conservative as electors with instructions to vote for Trump.
Donald J Trump is the most corrupt president in USA üá∫üá∏ history
Not at all, that‚Äôs your belief, have at it.  It‚Äôs ironic an atheist would support such a self proclaimed ‚ÄúGod‚Äù fearing man like trump!
Kanye is just a spoiler anyone who votes for him is wanting Trump to win!!
Atheists for trump.........NUFF SAID!!
Biden can't  beat Trump, but COVID can.
Trump‚Äôs presidency has been his effort to pit Americans against each other. Here we are in the middle of a national crisis &amp; what‚Äôs Trump doing? He has pitted this with Covid19 and look were we are now.   Listen to Fauci
Trump already hinted that it may have been a terrorist act. What if it actually was Israel? Will Trump still say it was a terrorist act?  I think not. I will believe what ever Nasrallah says as he is the most sane person in the region.

The trump virus ü¶† the only cure will be in November
Yes, please keep moving forward by not coming back to Arizona. You are a complete failure and put us all in danger while you bowed to Trump. You don't even have the huevos to mandate masks. But you shine Trump's bearings. You are shameless.
...race relations on fire:Travon Martin and Ferrguson, just 2 examples. Barry is the villain here, not Donald Trump who always talks about our being the same and who has spent his time in office improving lives of minorities: economy, jobs, opportunity zones, 1st step criminal...
FU and everything you‚Äôve obstructed. Waiting two months was evil. Sit down &amp; take your medicine. The Heroes Act is the right legislation to pass NOW! And if you allow Trump to stop counting the census, we‚Äôll take all 10 R at risk senators down with a vengence, including you.
President Trump just finished his press conference, saying that Ducey‚Äôs been a great job. When will we hear from Ducey? Will he do a press conference tomorrow? Last time Trump connected with Ducey, Ducey prematurely opened the state. Will schools be forced to open?

He is following the Sinema (Independent) playbook to a tee.   The Az. State House might go D this year. I suspect Brnovich will run for Governor in 2022 but I can't think of a viable D.   Ducey is meeting with Trump/Pence in D.C. to open up.
Trump 2020 Mitch!
Anyone who believes this is president Trump's fault has their head in the sand.
McSally was *appointed* she is not a real Senator but she  kneels to Trump.  Kelly will be another Sinema who is another Joe (RepubDem) Manchin. So why even have this election?
The first thing I want President Biden to do is to appoint a commission of Republicans and Democrats to find every official hired under Trump so they can be fired and review every agency rule changed and due process that change to ascertain if it‚Äôs a necessary change.

Trump can't negotiate a ramp, and a bottle of water.  Your candidate does not have the high ground.
If Trump doesn't want to disclose who his Daddy is by releasing his taxes, he should be disqualified from running. Period.
Why?  Here in the US, people either blame Trump or Obama for everything regardless of what the facts say.
He also wanted to impeach him...but yeah...Trump should just ignore all that and blow kisses.
No.  Don‚Äôt take his words and misuse them like that.  They were talking over each other but Trump clearly said: ‚ÄúThey took that and made such a big deal.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äù is in reference to him wishing her well NOT the fact that she allegedly participated in child trafficking.

Controversial topic but i hate Trump for the sole purpose of his ideologies Trump isn‚Äôt our president because Trump is here for America as a whole the only thing that Trump has offered that‚Äôs good is the fact he‚Äôs bringing America out of debt other than that he‚Äôs still terrible
It should read ‚Äúlet‚Äôs scrap the presidential debate since sleepy, creapy Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt hold his own against Trump‚Äù
It's okay.  I wish others could improve, but I fear for Trump it is too late.
I wouldn‚Äôt! He wouldn‚Äôt stick to the facts, he‚Äôd get all blustery and bullying, he‚Äôd be playing to and audience that enjoys a soap opera drama rather than listening to actual facts. Trump can only filibuster. Waste of time. Let‚Äôs just vote.
I don‚Äôt have a religion. I have a relationship with Jesus Christ. I don‚Äôt put anyone or anything above Him. My wearing a Trump mask to church doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm putting Trump over God anymore than my neighbor wearing a Raiders mask is them putting the Raiders over God.
States buckled to Trumps DEMAND to reopen without a strategy! When the experts recommended a phased approach Trump insisted REOPEN NOW. Trump‚Äôs lack of leadership and concern for being re-elected is why we‚Äôre in this mess- wake up!
I couldn‚Äôt care less about Trump

OMG! Ok... pay attention. Simple. We could stop testing nationwide TODAY and thousands of people per day would still be DYING! Trump would be happy with lower numbers .. we‚Äôd still be DYING! Why is that so hard to understand!

Just like in May when trump came here and leaned on the govorner to open the state, Trump‚Äôs going to lean on him again to open schools.  And, Ducey will fold like a deck of cards.
Biden needs to debate Trump because the low information voter will get a chance to see what the Dems have put out there for their vote.

Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

I attended a Trump rally a couple of years ago. Narcissism is pretty much a given in presidents but does not disqualify them (consider the hundreds of times Obama used ‚ÄúI‚Äù in every speech). Trump talked off promoter for 1 1/2 hours. No incoherence. Biden can‚Äôt talk 5 minutes.
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?

Former Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he opposes expanded uranium mining near Grand Canyon National Park.
A vote for Biden is a rebuke of Trumpism. It is a signal that you support democracy and constitutional government. It is a vote that says to the world that in this nation, the people hold the power, not a cabal of criminals hell-bent on destroying the country from within.
...Think about it!! Biden is speaking for muslims and talks about the Koran.....muslims throw gays off bldgs and behead them in the middle east..... Do really want that here?? I sure don't!!! You vote the way think you should vote...its your life, not mine!!
Figurehead?? More like a deadhead!! Biden is.....just there... He's a marionette and there could be about 5 people pulling his strings.... Biden is really a sick man....and his wife  should be ashamed of herself for putting Joe through this!!! Its definitely elder abuse!!
Oh....me....oh....my........If it does happen, she and Biden can surpass Obama as gun and ammo sales-reps of the century.......or ever!!!

Biden lost a wife &amp; baby daughter in a car accident. He‚Äôs been a single parent. He lost his adult son to cancer, and now stays involved in his grandchildren‚Äôs lives. He looked after his own mother, who lived in a carriage house on his property, until her death in 2010 at age 92.
Lie: Biden "wants to double and triple everybody's taxes."  Fact: only your buddies, not "everybody." #trumppresser
I really don't look forward to voting for Biden (the Harris pick as VP definitely helps some) but he's the most realistic option for getting Trump out of the White House. If a Biden vote is what I have to do to get Trump out of office I'll gladly do it.
Biden and Kamala... Really... The best the democrats had was a bag of dust and a former prosecutor?
Good thread. Harris/Biden are baby steps in the right direction and I guess that‚Äôs about all we can hope for with them.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Do y‚Äôall want fascism? Y‚Äôall get to choose. Sure Biden and Harris have had their issues - what politician hasn‚Äôt? As someone I follow put it - voting isn‚Äôt marriage. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone‚Äù it‚Äôs like a bus you find the bus that gets you closer to where you‚Äôre going and take it!
Too bad biden and harris have done so much to ruin people's lives through the prison industrial complex
As if biden and harris are not also literal fascists?
Better than a vote for Biden. Rather go Jorgennson.
We all kinda knew Biden was going to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. Most of us also know this pick makes no sense and doesn‚Äôt add anything to Biden‚Äôs campaign.
So happy that the Biden team chose to fight fascism with fire!  #BidenHarris2020
I think he‚Äôs being a first class prick sarcastically saying Biden is not a catholic because he‚Äôs a democrat. I like the other guys comment: well maybe listen to you about politics when you start paying taxes.
I have not forgotten. Harris is the nastiest woman in Congress. Women need to get out and vote against the Biden/Harris ticket. I will never forget Mrs. Kavanagh's poor face during those hearings.

Obviously. We should definitely work to change the systems. But I‚Äôm simply pointing out that there isn‚Äôt much that can be done in 84 days. We can‚Äôt get another nominee. We get Trump. Or Biden come November. We must face that.
Who is yelling at people? I‚Äôm simply asking a genuine question. I think we should all certainly voice our concerns. Then I think we should step up and vote for Biden come November. And yes then we work to change the systems step by step
Biden definitely picked a wrong VP candidate, especially for Native American people, but as American politics go, Natives are always the last to truly be heard:
Kamala worked her ass off......literally....to get to where she's at!!! Now that Biden "tapped her" for the VP post, its just another "position" for her!!
Is anyone else worried about the possibility of being thrust into a complete polic state with this ticket? I‚Äôm still planning to vote for Biden but fuck am I scared to do so
#IAmANastyWoman And I will be voting for Biden/Harris !
She is a great foil to Biden's haphazard inability to speak extemporaneously. She is always on-message. Just not crazy about that prosecutorial thing.
I‚Äôm sorry this is happening again. But man life is not so black and white. As a trans man I‚Äôm supportive of Biden/Harris cause I want the current occupants out of the White House. I know that I‚Äôll never have the perfect candidate. No one will. But people can change and grow!
I‚Äôve heard enough of your lies and your CRAP. I‚Äôm heading off to donate to Biden/Harris and kick your ass to the curb.
did i want Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP? no. do i think it was a smart fucking move to sway independent/centrists? yes.
i will not hide my resentment for the Biden admin just because Harris is his vp. she‚Äôs a fucking moderate who doesn‚Äôt care about people any more than Biden does.  i just hope that our media can give Harris the grace she deserves as a black woman. benefit of the doubt engaged.
Ah yes. Biden/Harris are clearly the true socialist icons of our day. Most definitely.
It has been SOOOOOO long since I felt hope, I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it. I know it‚Äôs still a tough road ahead, but Biden/Harris will take us all the way.
Lmao im voting for Biden but I‚Äôll continue to shit on these bullshit centrist politics
Was I hoping for Elizabeth Warren? Yes. Am I still going to vote for Biden and Harris? Also yes. üó≥
she's still a cosponsor for bernie's bill. it think, at the end of the day, if there were/are enough senate votes (bernie won't let it go) then no one will care, it just not going to be what biden pushes.
who told joe biden that choosing a cop as his running mate amid protests about police brutality was a good idea
Worst choice ever. In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate
Biden/Harris - It‚Äôs about time.
Trump's just lucky Biden didn't save her for AG.
Stop. Grudem? He only makes a case if he is talking to the old Dave or you. For example, defense and nuclear policy. Trump is stoking a new arms race with his policy. Biden already has experience in de-escalating what I believe to be the #1 issue on the planet.
You are an inspiration, Stacey. I envision you as President in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, we‚Äôll do everything possible to put Biden/Harris in the White House!

I umm deleted that. Jorgenson over Biden.
I hope Biden picks Cardi B. #WAPmove
Did Trump literally say that if Biden gets elected ‚Äúwe will all have to learn how to speak Chinese...‚Äù  OMG. He is literally losing his mind right before our eyes. Please vote this lunatic back to real estate asap.
Is that the Biden bike ride they're talking about??? What a mask!! Looks like he's limp!!  Like he's going to be on the 4th of Nov!!!
I dont want to hear shit about Biden's gaffes anymore. Didnt this guy claim that the continental army took the British airports during the revolutionary war?  Has he had a stroke? Is he in concussion protocol? Wth.
How much is China paying them? A vote for Biden is a vote for China not America. Biden also ignores the #2A.  #TrumpPence2020 for Americans!
When have you ever worked for Americans? For almost 50 years you have only cared about China and illegals. A vote for Biden is a vote to be ran by China. #WheresHunter #ObamaBidenGate

President Biden will say: ‚ÄúDear Americans, tear down that wall!‚Äù
People. Imagine the WORST presidency from Biden. Sit with it, find reasons to like, and even get excited by it.  Because that it what you are going to get, so keep voting blue no matter who, just like the elites in the party tell you to.
Maybe Joe Biden in the past, but now it is Joe Biden channeling Barak Obama &amp; leftist extremists.

Not every Biden supporter is a Pedophile...
Umm because they are NOT there working. On hiatus, at home being paid while most Americans are not getting paid. Also, trying to find a way to screw Trump and prop Biden up intellectually.
Biden's tweet about protecting Grand Canyon from uranium mining was his most liked tweet in the last 7 days.  It's so uplifting to know the high esteem Americans hold for the environment and Grand Canyon specifically. Feeling a little less alone. ‚ô•
On the day an anti-Biden ad voiced by Sam Elliott premiers. Sam, how could you?
Oh Oh!!  I think shes got what Biden has!!!  Time to get her out.....
Furthermore and I‚Äôll get off my hobby horse Bob, you can never take away the politics of these kinds of decisions. After Biden wins üòâ and if this tax nonsense goes on past 1/20, the tax will be reinstated. Then the conservatives will scream he‚Äôs raising taxes. Inevitable.
She's awesome &amp; having realized her 2016 mistake, will vote for Biden this time. #OK
True. And if Maureen Dowd is concerned how Biden's running mate will be treated, she should remember how she treated Palin.
If the election wasn't so critical, I'd be voting for  But the only thing that matters is getting 45 out, and that means voting for Biden.
üòÇü§£ Joe Biden and the Democrats have never cared about building in America and buying American. I guess President Trump showed you the error of your China ways. Joe just wants to raise or taxes and ban guns. No thanks! #TrumpPence2020
Voting for Biden this year and I think it‚Äôs the last time I vote Blue or Red. Fuck the two party system
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Joe Biden could show up at my house and literally take a dump on my lawn and I‚Äôd still vote for him, because Donald Trump has been taking a dump on the constitution every single day for the last 4 years. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Yang dropped out to make way for Joe Biden when Bernie was still beyond viable and the best hope we had of someone actually being a little on the left making it. He sold out to Biden &amp; CNN. He‚Äôs also surprisingly right leaning. Bernie is only very moderately Left/Libertarian
I no longer care who Biden picks for VP. I just wish he would retire.

He put up a traveling ban despite Joe Biden calling him xenophobic and Nancy Pelosi telling people to go out to China town. I got more but you asked for one.
Voting for sleepy creepy corrupt Joe Biden.... Is voting for George Soros.... And an evil one world government..... And eventually communism...... If you vote for Joe you aint black..... if you vote for Joe you aint American
So you are joining lying Biden? Disgusting!
Biden was raked over the coals for months because he hid in his basement and wouldn‚Äôt talk to anybody. Obviously the Harris campaign team made it clear that he had to come out of the dungeon and actually face people even if he doesn‚Äôt answer questions.
Imagine that ! He knows Biden has no business even running for president  !
I don‚Äôt like Biden either. Not a fan of him or Kamala. But you bet your booty once Cheeto is out I‚Äôm going to switching myself gears to educating about third party. I have changed four Trump supporters votes to at least democrat so I‚Äôm taking it as a win
Watch your back, ‚Å¶ boxed wine lady‚Äôs coming for you.
I would, but too many back out last second. I voted third party last election and truly hate myself for it. This year I fee I have to go for Biden to get Cheeto in Charge our. The following election I want to push third party

I can guarantee that Joe Biden will crack 90% chance of winning 24 hrs before Trump landslides him into retirement.
Harris IS the focal point of the election and everyone knows it.  (Outside WaPo maybe)  Biden is out of the picture any time between now and 2024.    Not IF, WHEN?
Biden couldn't get mileage out of this hoax  without A. Masses of ignorant followers and/or masses of followers who are just as corrupt.
(2)take votes away from Biden. You're sabotaging the mail by firing 23 supervisors, slowing down mail delivery and removing sorting machines. You're Republican cohorts are trying to suppress votes by closing down polling places, purging the voter rolls, etc.,
If you would have told me 20 years ago that the presidential tickets in 2020 would be Trump-Pence and Biden-Harris I probably wouldn't have understood you because I was a fucking baby then
If this is what‚Äôs going on 24 hours after the selection of the VP candidate then we can expect nothing but lies for the next three months.  The media will not find fault with Biden‚Äôs lies it will be up to us to do the fact checking.
Biden said countless times Trump was too aggressive and racist for stopping flights from China. Pelosi had a party in Chinatown.  I‚Äôd blame Fauci. Flip flopped weekly.
Biden has a bona fide recorded video history of lying and racism going back to his first term in office.

Tulsi has too much class to join the Biden ticket. Kamala Harris not so much!
Example of Liberals in a debate: Topic: Joe Biden being investigated Ukraine.  Liberal response: Well Donald Trump held the Bible up in the wrong way on his way to a historic church just for a photo op. Explain that. They only deflect because they have nothing intelligent to say.

biden,hussin oboma,clinton,pelosi all have committed treason that tril is hald by military court with death penatly
Biden: Here‚Äôs the deal, I um, you know, um chose Pamela Harris after I thought hard about, with... you know... the thing. I thought she must be qualified since you know... Willie Brown... we are about the same age and she pleased him from her position.
Joe Biden spent his life sponging off the American people and has nothing to show for it except his exceptional wealth that he has emassed!
Excellent choice! I can‚Äôt wait to vote Biden/Harris!!!

Republicans are claiming sexist attacks on Biden‚Äôs VP pick are fair game because of Palin. The attacks on Palin concerned her intellect, absence of curiosity, and lack of experience and ability. Nothing exclusive to her gender.
In Biden‚Äôs basement? Watch out  he may try to feel YOU up too.
And we believe you must be as nuts as Joe Biden ! To even think he could run this country !
Hold onto this for those‚ÄùCognitive debates‚Äù President Biden! Lol
Biden signs I saw, ZERO! Not one sign in sight. My question is why? Don't you think you should have signs plastered everywhere? This route also takes you through Laughlin and Las Vegas, Nv.. I'm just pointing out the fact that if I took notice of this how /3
Not to worry, Joe Biden can‚Äôt be bought! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Share this with everyone you know. Regardless of what you believe it at least shows what a lying slime bag Biden is and who he will use to reach his goals.
I listened to Levin, how when Obama did the payroll tax cut he stated that it's funng that the Democrats, Biden,  Pelosi and Schumer all praised Obama. They never said a word about social security. Now they are screaming it! Too funny! Trump2020
Everyone knows that Biden (if elected-God Forbid!) wouldn‚Äôt make it much past the inauguration before the DemocRats have him committed or invoke the 25th amendment due to his obvious incompetence. So the VP pick is paramount!
FWIW, If he [#Biden] wants to pick her [#SusanRice]  that's fine,  just saying there's a potential liability.    Nonchalant af.    PS.  Notice the cameramen doing a double take at the question?
Juan ; How do you know how older voters will vote ? You sound like Biden.

Biden will never debate Trump. He can say all he wants that he will show up! But when the rubber meets the road, he will  have some excuse and not show up! Biden is fraud and his campaign is a shambles. Jill Biden is the puppet master and pulling the strings.

Your guy Biden been in DC almost 50 years and done BUBKAS. You really think as he is losing his mind and hiding in a basement is going to magically change? OK think that, and keep that foil hat on.  Don‚Äôt buy the mantra that Harris is a moderate. She is no where near that.
is an intelligent man with good Morals, values &amp; Integrity unlike who we now have in the White House. Voting 4 Joe Biden will bring back the Values we once could be proud of.  We now live in a place that makes us lose sleep, fear what was done overnight by a President!

Well that‚Äôs real helpful.  Biden been in DC for 50 years. Done exactly BUBKAS! An now is losing his mind. Harris has a deplorable record. Incarcerated more Blacks in CA than any DA ever. An supports the biggest killer of all Blacks, thats Planned Parent Hood and is just mean.
While it‚Äôs true tax analysts estimate that all income groups, on average, would see an increase in their taxes under Biden‚Äôs proposal, the increases would be relatively small for all except high-income individuals and households.
The Democratic presidential hopeful would generate about half the money by raising taxes on households with incomes in excess of $400,000 and the other half by raising business taxes.
Joe Biden is the ultimate centrist Democrat...

She not even African, which means she not black. Biden should have kept is word
First off, Biden has been a sub-mediocare senator for 40 years and now, with dementia he would fall flat on his face debating President Trump. Secondly, Harris is a hag who has only learned to attack.  V.P. Pence is a gentleman who was a successful governor and can handle Kamala.
Joe Biden: the Ultimate Hypeman.
Republicans rally around their candidates.  Democrats infight because they didn't get what they wanted.  Our all or nothing political system sucks, but now we have a ticket - focus.  Biden Harris 2020
I wish Arizona had you on our side.  You are remarkable, JOE BIDEN should be making a place for you in his administration , The USA needs many many more Katie Porter's  !!!!
You mean the fact as DA she did everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row.  Or that she was proud to be indian until she could ride the BLM movement and now she's a proud black woman. Or the fact she believed Biden's accusers until she could be on his ticket
To keep an innocent black man on death row. She also believed in Biden's sex assault victims until she could be on the ticket with him.  Ya, they care so much about morals ROFLMAO
Wasn't she Indian before she needed to capitalize on the BLM movement for votes? When she was DA didn't she do everything she could to keep an innocent black man on death row? Didn't she believe in Biden's victims until she could get the nomination to run with him? She's a winner
anybody else scared about a   presidency ?   yep, no way will  will retain leadership.  VOTE !  Today was a disgusting love fest between Biden and Harris.   Political Whores !
Kinda wonder how the Biden staff did their candidate vetting! Rather poorly is a good guess
Joe Biden is a man of compassion, empathy, intelligence and integrity.  I can't say that about you or any republicans.  What a Shame you try to Bully others to get re elected!  That's Juvenile and Bullying behavior!  We need a President that is an Adult, and a Good one!

Wow....the odd OAN "reporter" set Trump up again. Who is behind the Google search redirect of " to Joe Biden's campaign web site? I am thinking she should ask Trump about his support of QAnon candidates.
Yeah try to deflect. Hunter is not on the ticket. Biden/Harris both  have more integrity in their little fingers than the entire Trump family has together. The Trump family has cheated and lied, deceived people and adulterous. These are not Christian values.
The only thing that could truly turn me off to a Biden-Harris ticket is the abortion stance. Still pro-life. There has got to be room for us, too.

My thought she was picked just to be a BOMB thrower. Keeping Biden save from explosions. They know few Conservatives will not care a twit about Harris! An well we don‚Äôt
Clue: Biden been in DC for close to 50 years an he has done BUBKAS! Nothing at all to his credit! Just keeping a seat warm is his best job
no he‚Äôs intimidated of blacks who know history. Google it from every media source.

two source.  Plenty more on google from different sources.  Fact checked.
That she is teaming up with a old school Racist in Biden!!
Love Liz Warren but she&amp; Biden had a beef about banking legislation that never got smoothed over.She was in the running only on paper.Sorry,wasn‚Äôt gonna happen.But that‚Äôs okay because Ms.Warren is going to be a major player when we get that Orange Assclown out of the White House.
I knew it, thanks to you guys (my tutors). Her NEW FACE spoke volumes. She WILL go after Biden (if elected) and deem him unfit for office. #WhoreOfBabylon #SignOfTheTimes
Benji You are a pitiful excuse for a man. Kamala Harris is an eloquent speaker, has great ideas, and will help Biden reunite the country that Trump has divided.
Lets go Biden/Harris!!!
What about the Constitution, she does not qualify do to parents not US citizens to be President, should Biden not make four years
Their best moment is being in the Trump smack down video of Biden...Look at this photograph

And it's only because of the fact that I live in a red state that your administration is sending out these emails.  Even your son's girlfriend is sending me bs emails after I responded to her to stop.  Biden didn't do that and I can't stand him just like I can't stand you.
Trying to convince their extremely ignorant base that Biden is infirm. More projection. Trump's the one that's spiraling before our eyes.
There's a lot of video out there of creepy Joe Biden like that
I've been a Bernie supporter for many years (since he used to do a hourlong call to Ed Shultz' radio show). Would I have preferred him over Biden? Yes. But any non-vote, write-in, or 3rd party vote IS NOTHING BUT A VOTE FOR TRUMP. We can't afford for this coalition to fall apart.
if it's a decisive victory for Biden-Harris we may never see that on the R side either
If you want jobs vote for Trump and Pence. If you want mobs vote for Biden and Harris.
Now that Kamala Harris is Biden's running mate, high. But he'll need to check w Evangelical leadership. Trump relies on their vote. Especially those that are also white nationalists beneath their Bible verses. Fortunately he will also find himself at odds w their misogynists.

Is that what you believe about Biden saying he doesn't want his kids growing up in a jungle, or around blacks?

Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.

LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Does anyone doubt the plan is to crash it the day after Biden wins?
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
We‚Äôre all family here and honorary Biden‚Äôs #FullSpeedAhead.
Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Are you honestly telling me that you think insulting people is a good campaign strategy?? Are you honestly passing yourself off as the Bernie supporter gatekeeper?? Let me guess; if (when?) Biden loses you'll blame Bernie supporters [again].
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA
Vote early before you see Joe Biden get creamed in the debates.
Like AOC, Maxine Waters and Hank Johnson, Joe Biden is #YoutubeGold
Is it me, or did he say absolutely nothing??? I am not against Biden... but hug??? The video with the hands is a "david Copperfield" move of distraction.
But apparently you don‚Äôt see a problem with the postal service union endorsing Biden and democrats concurrently pushing a mail in ballot this November.
For the record, I‚Äôll likely vote for Biden and hope he pays his food taster well.

Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

I didn‚Äôt.  So I‚Äôm taking a leap here but I‚Äôm guessing‚Äúbig news about ONE guy we already knew about‚Äù then leftist ‚Äúlawlessness and hate‚Äù a brief Hillary Clinton segment then Biden (joe and hunter) It‚Äôs the same show nightly (just a jumbled up running order)
trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.
Yes. The ones that baffle me are "Republicans for Biden"? If you vote for Biden and the progressive left agenda you really aren't a Republican.ü§î
Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...
‚ÄúAnd you know who really doesn't have it? ‚Å¶ .‚Äù #TWGRPS
She was caught by the Biden suprise.
Biden isn‚Äôt currently in government. Trump is the head of the executive branch.   See the difference?   He doesn‚Äôt owe the country‚Äôs assignment editors crap.
I‚Äôm not joking, if you don‚Äôt plan on voting for Biden, unfollow me. I‚Äôm not dealing with this shit, you either want Trump to win, or you deal with the lesser of two evils. And if you choose Trump winning, I don‚Äôt want you in my life. At all. Leave.

Well maybe she is the Biden whisperer.
Additionally there is no proof either way that Biden or Trump buys only American goods. Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US, while Biden during his 40 plus years did nothing to stop it from moving out of our country.
Trump made comments beginning in April alleging vast fraud in vote-by-mail and that USPS ineptness contributed to it. Biden picked up on it. Not baseless then, and not baseless now.
And here is Biden's boat parade!
If Joe Biden Was A Cop   Funny cause it‚Äôs true.
Biden press corps
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.
No shit!!! I‚Äôll have room in my car and gas in the tank.
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶
I thought you hashtagged "settle for Biden"...
Biden hasn‚Äôt spewed out thousands upon thousands of flagrant lies like Donald and hasn‚Äôt called the free press the enemy of the people. And he wonders why the free press treats him differently?
The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?
KH is at 90% approval with Dems. Higher than Biden. Log off here once in a while.
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
Haven‚Äôt liked Biden since the Anita Hill debacle. His trashing of Hillary made it worse. Will always b mad that this past admin did nothing 2 support Hillary during her run &amp; did nothing 2 halt the fraudulent election outcome. If Putin steals another election, will Joe blame Hil?
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).

Harris was so impossibly dreadful during those hearings - she made me cringe - and embarrassed that she was an "elected official" in our United States. Not even close to being civilized or intelligent enough to be a world leader. ¬†Look out, Mr. Biden - she's a back-stabber.
Definitely should be serving time in prison! Dangerous arrangement if she works for Biden.
For those interested in knowing. god it‚Äôs nothing like we wanted but we need to settle and do what we can. PLEASE vote Biden this 2020 election

I also agree but not because trump does. Biden should do what is best for his campaign. Who and how they do questions is their call. But this campaign has been successful so far by ignoring trump more or less and should stay that way.

I dont support everything he says. Esp. always taking credit for stock mkt. I think a huge mistake. I wasnt aware of mistakes made by Obama/Biden during H1N1. It's prob unfair to blame them. Just like unfair to blame Trump. The entire world has suffered from this you cant blame
Wow...you are the reason so many people vote third party.  You are attacking other liberals, this doesn‚Äôt help your cause.  If Biden loses, you‚Äôll blame the same liberals that you viciously and proudly attack,  great job in helping elect Trump.  You must be proud
the biggest obstacle Kamala faces is being a female leader.  at some point chopping down is nauseating.  shes got a job to do for 100 pct.  just like Biden.  at the highest level folks need to be judged on that plane.  I foremost would like a good VP and President.
Mark Twain once said you should never trust a man who has only one way to spell a word. But as is always true, actions speak louder than words. In Trump's case he acts, Biden did nothing but, plagiarize. bluster, self aggrandize and lie, for over 40 years.

It's funny that Biden only comments after the meeting about c-19 was wear a mask.
I would actually flip that perspective.  We got Trump as a reaction to the neglect of the working class throughout the country.  I think a Biden presidency, run on ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù will set the stage for an open racist like Tom cotton.
Biden the can't do man. Perfect candidate for the democrats, they are all about the can't unless it fills thier coffers, protects their agenda of evil, or furthers thier ineptitude.

Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Nope! We're well past that point! If Biden's POTUS, the fascist police will cont to beat &amp; kill ppl w impunity but the diff will be them wearing pink unis in support promoting women's rights.
Your beliefs sway wherever you think the votes are. you have a history of publicly denouncing Biden saying that he‚Äôs a racist that he is a sex offender and now you‚Äôre his running mate? you laugh about your marijuana use but imprison 1500 marijuana users not dealers?

He promised he‚Äôd never cut SS or Medicare and he hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure where you got that idea. Biden wants socialized medicine and open borders, which means an open stream of illegal aliens who want health insurance. That is unsustainable and ridiculous. Why should we pay for it?

Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.

I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere

Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.

She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
Krazy Kamala is a liberal who shouldn't be anywhere near the White House.  Put her next to Biden in the White House and then you're going the wrong way that Trump works for in building up this country üôÑ.

I am aware both sides are blind to their candidates misdeeds. I am not blind to the fact that 8 women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct or that Biden Wrote and defends the Biden Crime Bill or the most disgusting act of racism between the two is Biden being pro-segregation

Hi my name is Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Animals endorse Joe Biden üêæ‚ù§ #BidenHarris2020
Is that an early picture of Biden?
Better question, can Joe Biden? #DementiaJoe
If the issue is Ducey then we need to fire/recall Ducey. Not sure how voting for Biden helps. The Dems are the ones playing games more so then the GOP at the moment and if not for Trump signing the EOs we still wouldn‚Äôt have shit coming to us.
I think many feel Biden has already won, but just like the first time around I believe the Moron can actually win again one way or another. I just hope if nothing else the senate can be flipped and the house stays as is and if he gets in they can make it impossible for him to do
Well he travels around the country and didnt know the Chiefs were in Missouri and called Colorado a border state. They both are a mess, but if you think Trump isn‚Äôt on that same level as Biden I don‚Äôt know what you are watching.
It‚Äôs truly insane to be honest how many people refuse to publicly even speak Trumps name out loud, but will be honestly voting for him in November. I don‚Äôt trust these polls as far as I throw them. I agree. The lead has to be 15 or more for Biden to feel somewhat secure
I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.
Attacking Biden because they can‚Äôt come up with any accomplishments to talk about?  Or any plans he has for the country going forward?  Got it I think I will listen to Joe Biden. üò∑ #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.
Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Ummm...Greg I didn‚Äôt make up the nickname for Hiden Biden   ‚Äú1% Joe" ‚Äî  an insulting reference to Biden's past performances in the 1988 and 2008 Democratic primaries.
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.
Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

"For all his klutziness and indiscretions, Biden‚Äôs overall message appeals to our better angels and hopes, while Trump‚Äôs appeals to our demons and fears."
So Hunter &amp; James Biden (Joe's brother) have been making money off the family name because of Joe being Senator/VP for a long time. That doesn't change the fact Joe is running against the WORST President ever &amp; we'll still vote for him. The Trump crime family is the greater evil.
It votes for Biden or it gets the Trump again.
Isn't that the point of the choice?  Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'  #FoxNews
We've 80 days thereabouts b4 mandatory Biden bullshit or hopefully Trump pulls his trump cards and wins this poker match. Or its a lame duck called Biden and the liars hand called Kamala Harris.
Those that trust Trump on the economy need to remember, it was Biden who oversaw the 2009 Recovery act. Trump actually did nothing for the economy but ride on Biden's coattails.
Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden???
She doesn‚Äôt just think he‚Äôs a racist. She thinks he‚Äôs a creeper too.

The problem with this is that it‚Äôs a hypothetical situation. Nobody knows how many people could be killed by a Biden admin because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. With Trump, we already know and it‚Äôs getting worse every day.
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
From the BIDEN Republicans
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).
I‚Äôm saying it now. President Biden.
Joe Biden fundamentally doesn't understand how our government works and is 100% unqualified to run this country. Governors don't make laws, the legislature does. Any "mandates" by governors or the president are illegal  and unenforceable #unmaskamerica #covidlies #NeverBiden
you are the one doing political interference by attempting to interfere with the Presidential election to help Biden, do you really think people are too dumb to see what you are doing?
No, fascists Biden and Harris: You cannot mandate #masks.  They have been proven to be a health hazard, and you cannot mandate a health hazard. Here's the proof:
The Media and the Democratic party are babysitting Biden.
They just doing what they told  Right now USPS &gt; anything  The way it should be  Joe Biden pedo &gt; everything
She‚Äôs a liar. She doesn‚Äôt even like Biden. She‚Äôs just trying to be president
Apparently people think Yang will lose in 2024 if Biden wins in 2020. Idk where why or how that makes sense.

I like presidents who weren't born rich. They understand what it's like to struggle. They learned empathy,  Biden &amp; Harris understand. Obama &amp; Clinton understood.   tRump was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, which he swallowed &amp; pooped out.   #VoteBlue2020  #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden is a clear cut racist but getting a pass, like how republicans give trump a pass for their ‚Äúparty‚Äù we deserve better than 2 racist old men
Even male actors don't put their arms around women for photos anymore to show they aren't sexually assaulting the woman. . It's easy to accuse sexual assault. It is a genuinely disgusting problem. I want to give both sides the benefit of doubt. With Biden.... WTF
Started with Beto O'Rourke and worked my down. I think Biden was the weakest of all Dems running.
Kamala Harris and Biden only one will be in charge and it's not Uncle Joe. Harris will try to run the country because Biden cannot. Kamala cannot run the country. Foreign affairs Iran North Korea China she has no experience to stand up to these countries. Just a bobblehead.

This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Well everyone you should asked Biden and Harris since they raised 50 million dollars in two days  maybe they should give everyone 1200 dollars or as much as they can until the Democrats come back from there break.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

Second this but won't relax until Inauguration Day if Biden wins. And perhaps not even then.   Since this is my first national election in Arizona, relief from the constant barrage of election-related ads will be more relief than I can properly describe.
No one can claim that this is a sound clip. Biden only speaks in incoherent sound clips and in no sane world is this rant acceptable.
How selfless of her! I hear she's good at cleaning up problems #Bleachbit   #FoxNews

But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'

Vote for Biden. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
REAL TALK:  Joe Biden would be BY FAR the oldest elected president... ever.   We have witnessed him already losing it‚Äî he can‚Äôt even keep it together on the campaign trail. He would almost be a decade older than Reagan.   This is a serious concern about his capacity for the job.

One thing about Biden‚Äîevery year he gets more hair than he had the year before.
What part is an exaggeration? Are saying that Biden didn‚Äôt argue in favor of segregation in schools, or that multiple women haven‚Äôt accused Biden of touching them inappropriately.
He‚Äôs not leaving period, Biden alrady said he will prosecute.
Hillary wants to serve in a Biden administration. First of all there won't be a Biden administration. And secondly there won't be a Biden administration! Bye bye Hillary, bye bye pedo Joe, bye bye heels up Harris!

It is not just a vote against Trump it is also a vote against Biden. There is no arguement in the world that would get me to vote for a candidate with a history of racism and multiple sexual assault allegations.
The last stand of hate, fear and racism. the final days of Hitlers hate filled days in Germany, the last stand of apartheid in South Africa, the last days of the slavery fueled southern Confederacy. Yes, vote like your life depends on it. America depends on it. Biden/Harris 2020!

Can you pin point what Biden has done in 40 years in office 8 being vice president?...that has helped us...anything...
Ahhh man....see I wish Biden would get asked questions..."After 40 years in office....can you tell us 1 thing you've accomplished?...Better yet..8 years vice president"
It was totally preventable - GET  out before Monday and me in - do not blow this off!!!!! This entire debate season was a nightmare for all of America with out my national presence - Change this for me - call Biden - get his head out of his....this is serious.
You and Joe Biden should be roommates in the old folks home. You both have dementia.
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
not a biden stan, he's just in favor of harm reduction. he hates biden but will vote for him to get trump out
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.
Duh, he‚Äôs on a mission to take Biden out since his boss can‚Äôt beat him in a straight up fair election.

The people that are going to vote for Trump, are going to do it.  The people that aren't, are going to vote for Biden, or stay at home.  Period.  People's minds are made up.  Now it is about ground game and getting people's asses to the polls, or getting their ballots in the mail

'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical to defeating Trump. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.
I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states
Cuomo is as brainless as Pelosi, Biden, Harris and anyone else who would be stupid enough to put a patient in a nursing home being positive for covid-19. Try again.
not many ppl are saying you have to. some of them just want to have a discussion on this. they want to persuade others to vote for biden as well, which is no different from any other debating. but yes there are some who are vote shaming, though they are still leftist
Babies however are getting wise now to Biden and have learned how to duck, bobb and weave as Creepy Joe moves in for the kill.
When he opened his mouth as Obama‚Äôs VP he pushes things forward on gay marriage. So no we didn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut. You don‚Äôt know what Biden‚Äôs policy or record are. Obviously.

Biden is a fascist.
Biden and Harris give me hope.  Thanks for the walk and talks.  Love them.
That's not enough to get my vote for one sexist and racist over a more sexist racist person. It's great you and A D have healthcare and an education, but what how about all the poor people that Biden and Harris  will ignore after being elected? I can't support that.
Are you talking about Biden politicizing his sons death for sympathy?
Nothing anyone can come up with about Biden and Harris can hold a candle to the Cult45 and the most corrupt disgusting administration ever.
Joe Biden doesn't know the difference between "volunteering" and "mandating". This entire speech was a total lie. Move to China you authoritarian, unpatriotic f*ck #NeverBiden #NeverKamala #unmaskamerica

We found our true leader - Xi Jinping Biden - a wanna be dictator
Biden could easily say "Because Donald Trump has disgraced the office that we hold dear, with his unwarranted and untrue accusations about my running mate, I will not dignify this in any form".
Day one of Biden in office he should get a medal
i have this mindset, and i do question how the party nominated biden. bernie was a far better pick but either more voters chose "electability" over m4a, or it was rigged. but biden is the result, and i'd rather see him in office than trump
They are such doubled standard people.  The more Biden opens his mouth the more Americans see big government like China

I am so sick of people confusing Harris as the obvious choice with her being the "safe" choice. Every ticket with a woman on it in US history as lost, and Biden put a multiracial Black woman on his. That's not a "safe" choice.
Are you trying to convince me that Biden sucks? Why? When did I indicate I don't already know that?

Lifelong AZ Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted
we all believe we're correct. let's just respect our comrades even when we disagree. i respect you and your decision to not vote for biden. i only ask for that same respect
i've had this conversation with a lot of ppl, and usually it's been respectful. i never intended to shame anyone for not voting for biden. if you vote green party i have nothing against that. but it seems like you take personal issue with my voting decisions
Kamala Harris last year on Biden's praise for racist segregationists  via
Fox's favorite lush said Biden won't make the ballot. Trump said he has an October surprise. Does Pirro know something we don't? Or is it just another pink elephant in the room?

If by Joe Biden you mean you do. Then yes
Arizona Republicans for Biden - we need someone to unite our country and someone we can believe in #BidenHarris2020
im not a big fan of the Biden/Harris ticket, but the fact that the right is already questioning Kamala‚Äôs birth in the US (born in California) is filthy
My gosh Marci. I obv meant in this conversation no one is denying racism/sexism exist. Biden is not a racist. Kamala Harris is not a white man. Biden won black support bc he earned it over decades. It‚Äôs offensive 2suggest that unless people voted your way they have false beliefs
Bwahahaha ok who was using press conferences as campaign rallies? Can you all remind me please?  Fox News: Trump hits back at Biden after call for national mask mandate: ‚ÄòStop playing politics with the virus‚Äô.
The Amendment says Dec 15th 1791 this is going to be a tuff one for any politician read what I have posted for you Joe Biden.

Hey Joe Biden I think you need to read this it's very important
well first of all not everyone arguing this point is a liberal. getting tired of the leftists who gatekeep the community over things like this. plenty of leftists are voting for biden, and that doesn't make them not leftists
Hey Joe Biden while your at it why don't you come and take all my black belts when you knock on my door.
I know I don‚Äôt know how you actually make the doc and support Biden. Especially if you really care about mass incarceration but she must just be a black trauma peddler.
Last month 10 million guns were sold Biden says if he wins he coming for your guns.
How do you not understand the very simple idea that if you are born in Oakland, California, you are a citizen? Is this something that you can imagine in your fever dreams that Biden‚Äôs vetting would ignore.
Totally unacceptable.  The  and Biden campaign need to address this now. They can start by giving  a whole lot more than 60 paltry seconds to speak and adding  to the roster as well.
Biden says he is coming for your guns well I say how will you defend our great nation
The fact that Biden has been so aggressively against legalizing marijuana and Kamala thinks locking people up for possession is hilarious should be enough to turn off... 78% of Democrats.
Are you going to hold Joe Biden to a standard? Just asking for 80 million friends?
. needs to be working to *strengthen* his support among Latinos &amp; progressive‚Äì‚Äìomitting the deportation moratorium in this way undermines both efforts. The campaign must correct this immediately.
So sick of seeing  and their fake ass polls.   Biden-Harris up seven points?   Give me a break.
He is calling you Kamala Harris and Biden Dumb and Dumber hahaha
Joe can destroy trump. Joe Biden has the brains heart to lead our country. #BidenHarris2020
Hopefully #friendOfThePod Sen Harris can finally help book VP Biden on the pod. COME ON THE POD
The promise of a deportation moratorium was one of the most important commitments  made on immigration &amp; human rights during his campaign.  It must be included on his website, and the ticket must own and defend this crucial policy.
Everyone who is preaching for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than Trump‚Äù preaching ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù that guy said ‚Äúpoor people are just as smart as white people‚Äù my god
thanks for the respect. i do know who they are and why i'm voting. in my eyes i just can't see how trump and biden are equally bad, so i feel an obligation to vote for the lesser evil. a nice end to the conversation tho, thanks!
Biden has been wrong about everything for 40 years the only thing he holds steady on is his constant racism! #Trump2020 #NowMoreThanEver
Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£
. is right. As a delegate to the  I joined with him &amp; 100s of Biden, Bernie &amp; Warren delegates in voting NO on the platform because it excludes #MedicareForAll.  Especially during this pandemic, it is time to #DrawTheLine and guarantee health care to all as a right.
Tulsi debunked Clinton and Harris, the DNC, Russian plant, 3rdy party spoiler conspiracy theory and did as she said she was going 2 do from day 1. Support the eventual nom. U dont see her actively push her supporters 2 vote Biden, say how Biden will b the next FDR.Bernie does tho
I know I speak for many, many Americans in saying "We're certainly glad YOU'RE here  with us right now so you and future-President Biden can help lead us out of this darkness". Your mother was so wise, and definitely raised you and your sister right!
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews
"Murder of innocent children is essential healthcare service." - Joe Biden
Trump doesn't have a pet. Let's face it any pet he would own would bite him.  Why doesn't some journalist ask him why Biden and Harris don't like cows?
I sleep well every night. So no difference for me. Even if Joe Biden wins the election there is so much damage done to the country that will need to be fixed. Life isn't going to switch to all good like flipping a light switch. Anyone thinking it will isn't being realistic.
This might actually sway the polls in Trump's favor. If Biden is smart he won't commit to anything with her until after Nov 3.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

Marxism at its worst. Biden is a puppet but a dangerous puppet. He has sold his soul to Satan.
A miracle if Biden makes it till election day. Harris and her nutty past ,with it's many contradictions, will stick out like a sore thumb. Trump is going to Reganize the Democrats.
I‚Äôm not saying ¬´don‚Äôt vote for Biden¬ª I‚Äôm saying that the Ds are sick assholes who are saying ¬´fuck you if you want #MedicareForAll or someone who isn‚Äôt horrible, if you don‚Äôt want trump you‚Äôll vote for Biden !!!¬ª like they‚Äôre damned terrorists.
i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention
I've been going through all the bad people in the OT Bible casting them w/ Dems... Some are easy Jezebel - HRC. Ahab is of course WJC. Haman is BHO. Working on Nanshy, Schumer, &amp; Biden. Kamala plays Potiphar's wife. Satan - Soros. Job - General Flynn...
Today We Vote Donald Trump Out #electionday  #election #election2020 #trump #trumppence #biden #bidenharris #biden2020  #trump2020  #amazonWhat about Obama‚Äôs lies? Biden? Hillary? Pelosi? Schumer? How did they get so rich while they‚Äôre in public office? You never thought of asking these questions of your party? Perhaps you should before casting your vote in November
Keep on believing that Biden will save you. You are in for a rude awakening if he wins.
Biden chooses communist to head his digital Arizona campaign. Keep this in mind as we head to November.
Why not recommend that Congress stay in section until a compromised deal can get done? They might listen to you and you might even get a cabinet spot under a Biden/Harris administration
So many people on my tl are employing each other to settle for Biden/Harris. But will think that anyone that voted for Trump/Pence is full throated MAGA. Like Republicans didn‚Äôt settle for Trump when it came to him and Clinton.
Media on Trump ‚Äúhe‚Äôs temperamentally unfit‚Äù Media on Biden ‚Äúlook he rides his bike‚Äù
Joe Biden has been expressing his opinions on what needs to be done for months!  I guess no one in the WH knows how to read.
Disappointed, but not surprised about Kamala. The other highly unpopular candidate that the establishment chooses for us? Of course. Considering Biden's age she might actually be president.  Only going to be that much harder to bully them from the left now.
Very possible that I might change. She emphasizes the worst parts of Biden‚Äôs political history.
NEW: Pres. #Trump already out with a campaign ad against #Biden‚Äôs VP pick Sen. #KamalaHarris
Fortification pick; if Biden has to resign or otherwise makes it through his first term (if elected) and decides he doesn't want to re-run, Harris will be "in the pipe" and ready to roll.  I think she was always the right choice strategically and politically.

I'm sure you are praying for as many to vote as possible before the debates start. biden will make a complete fool of himself.
He has no clue!. Obama lead the way. He didn't mind using Biden. How much was your damn family get paid.  Shame on you all, including his family.  You all really Care.
biden is a pandering old fool.
Are you on board with the other government officials writing letters/signing petitions to get Congress in the pull this postmaster general dejoy in for questioning, and possible removal? If you and VPJoe Biden can you do something/anything along those lines that would be great!
I would have if Sanders was the nominee, but I'll be staying in this election Voting for a far right Republican or Center right Republican isn't a choice I can stomach There is no substantive difference between Trump and Biden and neither will improve my life so both can fuck off

You‚Äôre gonna have to do a lot better than that if you want a pardon. Endorsement and complete and total oppo against Biden. Maybe float some fake conspiracy theory. ‚ÄúInsider leaks never before released‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt have to be believable. Pucker up buddy.
which begs the question:  Which will be worse, 4 more years of Trump and then we're done with him, or 12 years of corporate controlled neoliberals Biden/Harris?
There's also this:  Trump wins and we're stuck with him for another 4 years, then he's out.  Biden wins, and we're likely stuck with him and Kamala Harris for 12 years if Biden bows out after 2 years due to "health reasons". Kamala takes the reins and can run for reection twice.
The Biden/Harris Campaign Launches four more Ads in¬†Arizona
That's my thinking too. Biden is a figurehead POTUS for the first 2 years, then bows out due to "health reasons".  Kamala officially becomes POTUS and because there's less than two years remaining in the term, she would be eligible to run for reelection twice.  So yeah, 12 years.
It keeps Biden from aimlessly meandering around the "set". He stays seated long enough to video him. Kind of like a baby pen.
I understand the other. I understand Trump, though it is problematic. How the heck can you vote for Biden?
UAE Publicly Recognize The State of Israel. HISTORIC. There are Democrats in Congress who do not. Breaking News Biden says wear a Mask.
Even her her laugh is phony. Side-by-side she is as White as Biden.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Wrong.  It's like having Trump shit on you and taking a shower to wash it off.  Then moving away from Trump and getting Biden who won't shit on us.
Bill Biden?
Failure - Worst President Ever!!! 2nd Fattest! Worst Leadership Style. Most Americans dies in one year due to inaction on his watch. Most divisive President. Racist, Orange, Wild Comb Over. One Term. Defeated by an older man a black woman. This is what he will be known for.
The world will CELEBRATE WHEN YOU ARE GONE.  My bet is you will be in Russia before Biden moves into the "PEOPLES HOUSE'.  It is the only way you will stay out of jail.  I'll bet he makes a deal with Biden and sends you back...roflmao
I don't understand how this is satire. It's simply the kind of bad argument certain kinds of politically pretentious types would make, no indication you aren't serious. Your bio says "Never Biden" in it. You may know you're kidding, but to random Twitterites, how do we know?
I could care less for Kamala (and Biden for that matter).  But how much control did she *really* have over those issues?  To what degree was she truly involved?   And how much power did she have to reverse these issues?
So Refreshing to read all this and Not hearing any name calling!  Just so Peaceful and Facts Thank You Joe Biden !!   üá∫üá∏‚≠ê
USPS sucks because Bruh is cutting services so SEE USPS sucks? What the hell is wrong with you? Would this be okay if Obama or Biden did it? Mail in voting in AZ, FL, NC. Trump says those places are a-okay but not anywhere else!
Of course taxes will be raised, after the mess you created. The difference when PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN raises taxes is it will be the rich 1% that have to pay!
"Get back ON the plantation!" (Harris kept people in prison past their release date to continue to use them as essentially slave labor, And we all know about Biden)
Republicans are Now VOTING for BIDEN !  üá∫üá∏  Let's Go Arizona üå†
Pelosi is as out of touch as Biden. TRUMP SAID THE MEDIA'S REPORTING ABOUT THE VIRUS WAS A HOAX NOT THE FACT OF THE VIRUS! Why in the name of truth can't conservatives tell the truth about this every time this cow says that? To quote Biden,  "C'mon man."
But there is no backwards for people in my position. When you hit rock bottom you have nothing to lose. YOU might have something to lose, but I don't care about you, I care about me. And since Biden will do nothing to improve my life I'll be staying home. D party can suck it
It‚Äôs Biden for Christ sake! They know he‚Äôs a republican!
Uugh, I owe you nothing,  don't know you and once again,  since you rely on the leftwing rag Politico for contemporary Church history you're not looking for truth and therefore you're as untrustworthy as a Joe Biden apology or as Kamala Harris being African American.
Best revenge is buy face shields, wear a mask, distance 6 feet and vote in person and lets be counted so overwhelming on election night Trump gets to hear the election called for Biden-Harris.
All voting Biden buy face shields. wear over masks &amp; vote in person. Horse is out of the barn. Trump has already set up vote by mail with chaos, confusion &amp; in person votes will be counted on election night preventing Trump tying election up in court or Barr SCOTUS interference.
Biden raises $26M in 24 hours after VP announcement...  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Most people are OK masking-up indoors where one can't socially-distance. But if Biden becomes associated with the masked alone in their cars/hiking in the desert/jogging in a park folks, he'll just look like a nut, and will turn off the 'middle ground' folks he needs to win over.
Investigate Biden and Harris? No surprise.
I would bet Biden loses. the socialist Demoncats corrupt impeachment of Trump, the smearing and lies about Brett Kavanaugh riots around America. The Demoncats have awakened a sleeping giant

Nope someone‚Äôs wrong somewhere trump is running the country the right way instead of the wrong way Biden wants everyone and there brother to come in and blow up everyone and he wants illegals to roam freely and gangs as well think about it we want trump
Why should the  want COVID-19 relief?  If Trump wins, they have four more years of graft and corruption.  If he loses they blame Biden for the mass death and depression.   They obviously don‚Äôt give a damn about anything or America.
It's really simple- all Kamala has to do to get my unwavering support, is to just keep her word! #MedicareForAll   Unfortunately, there's about 0% chance she will keep her word; she will fall in-line behind Biden.
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!
Utter shite! I'm reluctantly voting for Biden/Harris, but I'm NEVER going to stop speaking truth about their horrible policies. #MedicareForAll

Hum... nobody wants 4 more years of terror, death and destruction under Trump.   It‚Äôs not a hard choice.   Also... Harris is a great selection and Biden will make a great president.  Why try to stir up drama where none exists?  Why not focus on the terrible pandemic, instead?

I'm so confused. Biden and Harris are taking away cows? #VoteBidenHarris2020
Joe Biden is awfully dry.

Masks aren't good and shouldn't be mandated plus a president can't order it anyway.  Trump isn't a tyrant, Biden is panting to be one.
WHO writes your nightly news headlines?  Trump didn‚Äôt BLAST Biden for his stupid mask mandate!! SOOO tired of NBC‚Äôs bias against this president!! Any mention tonight of the PEACE Agreement between Israel and the Arab Emerates?? That‚Äôs NATIONAL News by the way!!

Who is 'they'? Are you talking about democrats? Biden, Harris?  You are fearmongering, which can be argued is not Christian - especially when there are no facts to support it.
How much good can AOC actually say about Biden though?
That's what it looks like. He'll annex after our elections, either handing Biden a political crisis, or giving tRump a distraction while he dismantles Soc.Sec &amp; Medicare.
My hellworld prediction: By 2024 AOC will be a lot closer to Biden/Pelosi/Harris in ideology than anyone would like to admit
the could be a tremendous influx of Democrats fleeing New York or just plain old coon ass war bosses doing for Biden what they always did for Huey Long.

It might be real issue if it wasn't for the fact almost every single person is now already wearing masks when near others or in a store  Biden wants to be the Communist dictator they all accuse Trump of being. Plus it's just bullshit politics  And why didn't Biden take questions?
45 will always be 45. 46 will be Biden, or 45 will continue for another 4 yrs. DNC &amp; Dem elites rejected the will of the people and gave us a corporate controlled career politician with dementia as their candidate. If Dem's lose again, they have no one to blame but themselves.
#JoeBiden just said he would autocraticly mandate everyone in all 50 States must wear a mask in public. If u are taking a walk in Montana Biden would arrest you.  Of course, Biden dictated no mandate or arrests for people criminally looting stores &amp; burning down neighborhoods
Will Birthers take a look at Trump's situation at birth ? Biden and Harris were welcomed into this world by loving parents. Isn't that more important? Trump's parents, sadly, never loved him.

Let's talk money, #Biden's plan isn't "sever" since - Most players can gain as short-term that are taxed as ordinary income. Currently long-term capital gains tax rate is 0%, 15%, 20% depending on taxable income &amp; filing status. Hire a good accountant, - be LLC - it works out.
This is why democrats can't get their party in line. Too many republicans like the Clintons, Obama, Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer are dividing it. About 40% of dems are progressive, that leaves 60% divided among the other factions. Dissing 40% of the base is not smart, especially now.
YOUR TURN: Joe Biden running mate Sen. Kamala Harris called the Trump administration "failed government" &gt;&gt;   Do you agree?
With every possible step the DNC could take to help Biden win progressive votes, they're doing the opposite. Kamala antagonizes them &amp; Biden's campaign mirrors Hillary's with no hope of progressive policies only offering the "Biden's not as bad" line. They're going to lose again.
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.

There‚Äôs a whole sect of liberals who don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden/Harris because they have done nothing but attempt to woo current trump voters. You‚Äôre not going to. Work on getting the left back, not going more central. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôll win.

This is flat out untrue. Anyone who took the time to listen to all of the words that Trump spoke would know he was referring to the normal people on both sides of disagreement. NOT the extreme of either. Biden...take your Aricept.
Just saw a Trump ad attacking Biden. Narrator sounded like Sam Elliot. I REALLY hope it wasn't actually him and just an impersonator.
#BidenHarris2020 Yep, I said it. Your only excuse is you‚Äôre sure Biden is so senile that it‚Äôs not really him you‚Äôre voting for.
Goodbye tRump!  Hello Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   üß¢BUILD BACK BETTERüß¢ üá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏ üó≥ üì¨
my instructor told me do a paper specifically on ‚Äúhow NOT to do business-And fail in life‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know who to pick, he said why don‚Äôt you do the next runner-up for president he‚Äôs a businessman and it was downhill from there in my thought process of him, and his family
Ur just jealous because ppl support them and ur ratings once again as always is in the shitter. I am voting for Biden and Harris. They will lead our country back to where it should be. He will work for the ppl not the other way around like Frump has done 4 the last 3 1/2 yrs.
Yeah no shit huh that‚Äôs not even a joke I really did do a research paper on the Trump business when I was in business school and I found out all sorts of shit and that was one of them zero military service (that I could see anyway)
No, .la, Trump "inherited" a huge mess!  He changed a crippled economy to booming one. He revived our military which obummer had nearly depleted.  The housing industry soared. Most of those biden and obummer had put on food stamps became proud independent employees.
So I watch the history channel documentary which I put up on this feed a couple of times when Trumps grandpa Went back to Germany, Germany refused to take them back, so they had to come back to the United States because of exactly that - he dodged the German mandatory military
A little etymologious disclosure...  Biden is Saxon of the genitive; Button which was a given name to those of nobility who made garments.  Harris is the English form of "harry" or "Harold" which means to "call forth" or take from or off.  Biden Harris - Take off your clothes.
Joe Biden lying to the American people for 50 years!
Biden needs to debate President Trump! That will show what a shame he is. #MAGA2020LandslideVictory #MAGA
RUN DONNY RUN! Ur going to get ur ass kicked so hard when Biden/Harris wins that ur ass is going to get between ur shoulders and then u will be talking out of ur ass. I know ur scared shitless so start running. And no cheating like u did in 2016.
Biden should know better, to no avail.  Will you trash him?
Progressives throwing a temper tantrum every time Biden does something is annoying as hell.  This election is a binary choice.  You couldn't get coalition or consensus when it came to the Dem ticket.  Move on and make things better.
im so conflicted and none of the posts i see like this seem to mention that BIDEN IS A RAPIST
Will the choice of Harris for VP make a difference?   Biden for President announced that in the 24 hours since announcing Kamala as the running mate, the campaign has raised $26 million from 150,000 grassroots donors.
I agree üíØ%. He has been attacking Biden and now Harris because he is scared because he knows that they r going to beat his ass. The only way he will win is by doing the same thing in 2016. He is a cheater, liar and that is all he knows how to do things. Biden/Harris2020
Guess she doesn't know  The Kennedys. Biden Pelosi are/were all Catholics? Not to mention the Pope? None of them would be fit to be judges? Did she notice that the pastors of her Baptist faith are among the RICHEST people in the WORLD? Priests take the vow of Poverty?
She is and will always be better then u. Biden and Harris are a good team. And I know u hate that he picked Harris for a reasons. 1.She is half African American 2. Half Asian  and  3. She is a woman. All these that u r racist toward. Ur going to lose!
Biden is just as much Fascism as Trump. The difference is one hides it
Democrats are desperate to get Trump to add $3 Trillion to his credit card to give Biden, if elected, a Bank Account &amp; more room to spend.
No, she's not. Unless the GOP is actually threatening to kill Biden just to make that happen, in which case ... isn't that illegal? Even implicitly?
Whoever is writing Joe Biden's tweets must have learned from Saul Alinsky. No lie is too great - with the expectation that if you repeat it enough, people will come to believe it's the truth. Can our country survive this level of misinformation, flat out lies and propaganda?
I am not charging you or others that I have seen with this. Jemar worries me a bit. Yeah. When I see ANYONE publically support or like or give the impression of supporting people like Biden and Harris, it worries me. Same with Trump. I am only leaning more Trump because of Biden.

Reasons not to vote for Joe Biden?
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
Joe Biden is a deteriorating shill of a Value Brand politician, way passed his prime... whatever that was... who can‚Äôt even stop himself from groping children when in front of the cameras   They think the American people are dumb.
Dear stupid, Biden is walking UP a dry ramp. Trump is walking DOWN a damp slippery ramp. He knew the media would have had great joy in watching him fall. Trump made a wise choice to slow walk the ramp. Pres. Ford fell and media never left it alone.
Joe Biden who stated that Communist China is NOT an economic threat to America. Biden who stated blaming Communist China for CCP virus is xenophobic! Biden who pushed to give China Most Favored Nation status. A vote for Biden is a vote for Communist China!
Biden has accomplished a great deal when it comes to helping Communist China take American jobs, pushed through Most Favored Nation State for China and made himself and his cocaine snorting dishonorably discharged son filthy rich.
Can‚Äôt wait for President Biden and vice President Harris to walk into that White House
Look what amazing shape Biden is in!!

Yeah she is, she could‚Äôve destroyed biden, had it teed up and everything, and fumbled because she‚Äôs just a shiny set of keys meant to distract
I meant I‚Äôm not voting Biden or trump. -_- those. Are. The. Two. Evils. Therefore. I‚Äôm. Voting. #JoJorgensen2020 was I slow enough that time for you punkin
Seriously ya'll.  Vote like Biden is down by 20 points.
Why am I voting for Biden? Well, aside from the fact that I am tired of hearing about the president, and for something stupid or scary every damn day, Biden have an typical experienced and functional administration that wont getting fired and arrested constantly.
Bashing Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt gonna help us beat Trump. Biden could pick a carrot for running mate and I will still put on my clown makeup every day and pretend it‚Äôs the best carrot for the job in hopes of convincing other Democrats to vote for him- aka not vote for Trump.
I want the debates.  I want to see Biden crash and burn.
That might be so for you, but you only get 2 choices, Biden or Trump, which one do you choose?
Yes he is. Confident people like Joe Biden are not afraid of criticism or different view points. They listen to good consul and hire the most qualified individuals and demand that they always tell how it is. Week individuals like Trump just want to be praised and adulated.
You want a battle??? GOOD. WE are ready. WE have 35K personnel who are all former military and liars like Biden/Obama are on our list. (just so you know the truth- HRC bought those votes) The votes were cast by illegals &amp; dead people. You want to fight.... Bring it. SEMPER FI
Economically, years, but I know this, the minute Biden gets elected, world leaders and allies will reach out to him. We will once again be respected around the üåé

What a difference listening to Biden and Harris as opposed to Trump and Pence. The first speak of compassion, hope and concrete plans to help us against COVID-19, rebuilt our country and economy. The later speaks of self praise, adulation, hate, division, lies and indecision.
Every time the MAGA crowd accuses Biden of "hiding in his basement," I like to point out that this means he's beating Trump without really trying. What's gonna happen when he really kicks in to gear?  We saw it today, and it was beautiful.
ohhhh so because its not a "name brand" party the opinions of libertarians are invalid. atleast Jo Jorgensen isn't sending non-violent cannabis cases to prison. Biden is the lesser of two evils and still just as evil. were gonna be right where we started with trump. bet on it.
you bet! to vote #JoJorgensen2020 seriously people Biden and Kamala are only going to keep companies and the prisons happy.
Hey Deb do you think she‚Äôll call him a racist like she called Joe Biden in a debate
I wonder if she‚Äôll call him a racist like she call Joe Biden
i think you‚Äôre over thinking this. she could mean, he‚Äôs old and could die. either way she‚Äôs theorizing about Biden‚Äôs demise. but it is an open question.
It's important to know who you're voting for. Unfortunately Trump is the alternative. I know more progressive change can come from a Biden/Harris White House than the current administration. I'm voting for the climate. I'm voting against racism. I'm voting for Biden and Harris
honestly if the Biden/Harris campaign wanted to get the Buster lefties on their side they'd use the right wing attack ads as their slogans lol
the right will think socialism wins even when the most conservative democrat gets in office!   Imagine how many garbage memes we'd get if Biden wins. tbh I kinda prefer that to the Ben Garrison deification of Trump.
The only worse choice for VP Biden could have made would be Nancy Pelosi
so what this video tells me is biden is a hard worker whos more relatable to the masses, and also not a fat out of shape fuck

1. People going back to work is not ‚Äújob creation‚Äù 2. Obama/Biden created more jobs each year of their administration than Trump/Pence 3. Jobless rate is over 10% and the economy contracted by over 1/3.  4. You have destroyed the growing economy you inherited

I agree they are trying to rig the election, but arresting Obama, Biden, Clinton is not worth the trouble it will cost. Barr is not stupid. He‚Äôs putting his energy into Comey, whose arrest would support their theory of the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù w/o enticing riots.
and Biden running on a position of "let's diversify rich white neighborhoods through zoning!" certainly would not be a winning strategy. (nor would it align with his past positions on such issues... like, *at all*.)
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòa Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
Hey DJ, You must be confused. Your tweet is for BIDEN-HARRIS!!!!
Barr is evil, he‚Äôs not stupid. He‚Äôs after Comey, et al, not Obama, Biden, Clinton. Even he said the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of would not be illegal. Clinton was cleared, yet again, by Barr‚Äôs own DOJ. The political cost is not worth it.
The DOJ is going after Comey, et al. Barr has already said that even the false nonsense they‚Äôre accusing Obama and Biden of was not illegal. Barr‚Äôs own corrupt DOJ cleared Hillary yet again.
Any vote against Biden-Harris in first past the post voting, which the US uses, is a vote for Il Cheeto and Penny.
I just got a letter from Blue Cross.  They made too much money last year and are sending everyone a check.  Thanks Obama/Biden!
The Biden campaign had better get organized in swing states if they don't want this to happen again.
A Biden-Harris dynamic will not only bring better policies for poor &amp; middle class, they'll bring integrity, competence, honor, and grace to the WH. Unlike Trump who only deals in fear, hatred, racism, misogyny, and stupidity. So happy when he leaves office; he never deserved it.

I believe the Biden/Harris campaign should make it clear that when elected, they will look into which Trump appointees have actively used their positions to disrupt government in order to reelect Trump.

Joe Biden is a Thief and a Liar, Corrupt to the Core !

The thing is though, like 90% of what Trump says, that's a bald faced lie.  Biden has released plans for policy, unlike Trump who literally has no plan, and he plans on increasing police budgets. Aren't you supposed to be a journalist? How about you do a modicum of research?
Anyone who chooses not to vote is essentially de facto voting for Trump. Biden/Harris were not my first choice but 4 more years of Trump is unthinkable! Please reconsider your decision not to vote.
Best I can say to people who are really upset their guy didn‚Äôt make it, and hate Biden and Harris is to think of it this way:  This election, you don‚Äôt vote FOR, you are absolutely voting AGAINST.
If you all have been screaming "defund the police" "ACAB" "fuck 12" or anything of the like but you gonna vote Biden/Harris just because it's not Trump......you're fuckin stupid, beyond stupid  There are more than those 2 choices......
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden huh!
Says the clown who has Biden/Harris 2020 as their Twitter handle.  The irony is epic
...Under President Barack Obama, Biden was wrong to advise against the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. And when President Trump ordered the successful and helpful killing of Iran‚Äôs terrorist-supporting Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Biden opposed that, too.
...Biden was wrong on the Reagan doctrine, wrong on the 1980s defense buildup, wrong on the Strategic Defense Initiative. He was wrong to oppose the first Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition deftly kicked Saddam Hussein‚Äôs troops out of Kuwait.
Former CIA Director and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served presidents of both parties, famously said that Biden had been wrong about ‚Äúnearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.‚Äù

Terry Sullivan‚Äôs comments about Joe Biden ‚Äúhiding in his basement‚Äù and comparing the excitement of Kamala Harris as VP pick being equivalent to sitting on a football to beat the clock we‚Äôre unhelpful, and unwelcome to me. His ‚Äúman cave‚Äù decor was a total, unappealing distraction
Not only did Pres Obama predict it, it's part of a cycle and Health Services have always predicted one.  And Joe Biden had written up an Op Ed in Jan 24th, 2020 telling everyone, everyone that the new Corona Virus could be the pandemic that Obama/Biden had prepared for.
Joe Biden should debate Diaper Donnie only if the Diaper releases his tax returns for the last 20 years first.
no i‚Äôm not. Biden is not who i want as president but i cant do anything about the candidates. all i can do is vote. i believe he is the lesser evil and will not attack blacks and mexicans and other minorities like trump has during these last 4 years.
"She Never Called Biden Racist" Watch Fox News Fact Check Trump Statement on Kamala Harris  via
They've gone a bridge too far!  Biden is an observant Roman Catholic.  It's nonsense like this that makes it so difficult to have a meaningful discussion with a MAGAt. Below is the only way to treat these statements.
More reasons to like Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs running mate.

so what are your thoughts then? you clearly seem very against biden and considering there‚Äôs only one other option...
Another Republican voter explains why she is voting for Biden and Harris. #VoteBlue2020
He flip flops. Now he‚Äôs mad that Kamala will be VP. Get ready for a lot of anti Biden content now.
you prefer an open racist? obviously i would rather have someone who is not racist or homophobic or sexist but we don‚Äôt have any in our options. realistically it‚Äôs between trump and biden, so i prefer biden.
If it's proven that Joe Biden is guilty of withholding a billion dollars to remove a prosecutor looking into Burisma...  Can Ukraine extradite him?
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden‚Äôs Instagram post with Harris   Normally I would not belittle anyone for such petty things, but in this toxic environment of politics where the Left has put our side under the microscope, all is fair game.
Biden Harris campaign slogan  I'll get paid, you blow them.
I hope everyone who reads this who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt vote for Biden-Harris will please consider voting for  for President so that you can vote your values and support a progressive platform
Lol if Biden cant win without my vote then biden simply cant win and should have never stole the election from the candidate polling higher than everyone
I hope everyone who reads this who can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt vote for Biden-Harris will please consider voting for  for President so that you can vote your values and support a progressive platform
And as for Joe Biden, Trump shows no signs of ceasing the same old lies about Joe Biden being a far-left destroyer of the American city that made the President lose many, many times before.
Trump is going into a lot more than overdrive on that front. In fact, he's headed straight into a state of personal confusion regarding Biden's VP, as his quickly rushed ad on her demonstrated. He can't decide whether he wants Kamala Harris to be a far-leftist or a phony leftist.
(Coming up) Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
For Biden?  Reach out and touch someone.  For Harris?  Reach out and incarcerate black people and Kavanaugh, all without evidence.  Not sure how you combine the two.  I guess ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black?‚Äù
You know the Trump team will lose to the Biden one when Trump can't even decide what kind of leftist he wants Kamala Harris to be.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will answer to God for their silence and non action regarding the death of the aborted babies. Knowing God I hate to be in their shoes when it happens. Just the thought causes me to shudder. God help their deceived followers they will receive the same.

I‚Äôm just pointing out that your faith in the polls and what you see online betrays you. Many Patriots are not included or do not respond to these polls, and that is why the mainstream media didn‚Äôt see Hillary‚Äôs landslide loss coming, and the same reason they don‚Äôt see Biden‚Äôs.
Lol, it's also misleading because 538 is hedging for what they think it'll be on election day. Right now Biden has a 92% chance to win.
This is accounting for changes post-debates and post-conventions.  The article says if the election were held today, Biden would almost surely win (90+% chance).
Whaat's wrong with this picture?? Biden's choice of Kamaltoe is making it too easy... something's up.
Harris has zero to do with Trump. Democrats want him to fight with her not wimpy limply Biden. Pence will take in Harris just like Tulsi Gabbard.
Harris Skin is as White as Joe Biden.
I don‚Äôt think morally trump or Biden should be in office. We haven‚Äôt heard anything in Jorgensen and she‚Äôs honestly and clearly the better candidate with the goals she wants. No one lets her speak it‚Äôs a 2 party system in the media when clearly there is a 3rd party.
Kamala Harris says Joe Biden isn't racist and you are IRRELEVANT.
I am so happy that Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Trump didn‚Äôt attend John Lewis‚Äô funeral because Lewis hadn‚Äôt attended his inauguration. Trump is a petulant child.  Biden knew that Kamala Harris had called him out on the debate stage &amp; still decided that she was the best choice for VP. Biden is an an intelligent adult.
Report: Harris Wasn't Biden's First Choice   HIS FIRST CHOICE WAS BRUCE JENNER LOOKALIKE, GRETCHEN WHITMER, BUT SHE'S NOT BLACK ENOUGH
I agree, we can stop him from getting away with it!!! We have VPJoe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è we ALL are.......** WE THE PEOPLE**
Biden decides Kamala Harris is 'black enough' to be his running mate   --   AND... SHE'S NOT EVEN BLACK!!
Here‚Äôs the obvious problem - does she still believe Biden‚Äôs female accusers?  How do they resolve this without looking bad either way? ‚òπÔ∏è
Y‚Äôall some fucking losers if upon hearing Kamala is the VP candidate the first thing you do is try to make her look bad or whine when this is an extremely important election and we all know she and Biden are many many many times better of an improvement than the scum in office
At least it's now crystal clear that Kanye's intentions are for one reason only, to take votes away from Joe Biden in an attempt to steal another election for Donald Trump.  What a shameful legacy. And a massive failure.
I don‚Äôt see how any progressive sees a Biden/Harris ticket and gets excited about it. It‚Äôs as establishment as it gets right there.
What about the millions of little girls that will never grow to be women because Biden and Harris and those like them choose to keep murder in the womb legal?  They don‚Äôt get a voice huh.
My bias?  I'm pointing out that the same "problems" Joe Biden has are celebrated proudly when coming from Trump.  Trump has divided us and brought out the worst.  He has got to go.  There is my bias.
The commercials depict that if Biden wins , if you call 911 no one will come to your rescue, while someone is breaking into your house..
Just put a nail in the Biden presidential campaign casket
DEVELOPING: Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris.
Y‚Äôall joe Biden is old as fuck!!!!
In fairness Trump attacked everyone in  the 2016 Republican primaries too, and now most of them either work for or closely with him.  It happens. I‚Äôm not defending Harris or Biden and refuse to vote for them, but primaries aren‚Äôt about inspiration.  They are about mudslinging.
Time to show Trump and his enablers, what America is really about. The racism and hatred that Trump and his campaign are trying to spread about Biden and Harris is not what America is about.
BIDEN is a senior of whom the DEMOCRATS are taking advantage of.  THIS IS ELDER ABUSE!
A continuance of the Obama Biden spirit. First Joy I have felt since the occupation of 2017.
Everyone‚Äôs already thinking Biden will only do a 1 term then hand it over to her for 2024 ü§î I agree Harris will be great even if she wasn‚Äôt my pickWhy are you on TV so much? It‚Äôs TOO much and you lie. You talk TOO much as well. What‚Äôs worse? You say same thing over and over, same boring script, monotone as you read the prepared remarks. Yawn. Can‚Äôt wait until we have a real President, Joe Biden and Kamala VP
Because Trump giving a speech bashing Biden is what we all want to hear. Says nobody anywhere.
#FranklinGraham is a disgrace to his father's name and legacy.  Franklin cares only about power and wealth, and those who have it.
I understand Trump haters will vote for anyone except Trump ..... they would vote for a box of cereal over Trump.  But, they don‚Äôt seem to realize that Biden will hurt their wallets .... destroy the jobs Trump brought back from overseas .... things he did for the working class
Biden has raised $48 million in 48 hours! Wow! Just wow!and  and  are raising a üòà seed
Biden is not President! ...  YOU are responsible for not taking care of business and helping this country! Stop blaming everyone else! DO YOUR JOB!!!
Mika Brzezinski on Trump‚Äôs response to COVID-19: ‚ÄúMany of those deaths, Mr. President, are on you and your terrible response to this virus ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt even show leadership on masks.‚Äù
The endorsement comes after the president's resistance to Postal Service funding,amid his fight against expanded mail in voting.  is against mail in voting except for his own state of Florida and another ( red state, he thinks)
So when Biden goes to the pasture does Nancy Pelosi take over as President or Vice President?
(W) NEW: Former Vice President Joe Biden leads President Trump by 11 percentage points, according to the latest PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist Poll I hope this is true and holds up. Trump is doing everything he can to cheat his way into another term.
No, Joe Biden isn't "hiding" in his basement. ‚¨áÔ∏è  How many times has drump gone hiding in the bunker? I will bet a lot.  is a weasel. A coward . Vote ‚ÄúBLUE‚Äù.Vote Biden/Harris üíôüíôüíô
Joe loved Beau and was a real father. ‚ù§Unlike  He was Never a dad to  and  That is why they are so jealous of biden and Obama.
Kamala is a strong leader, a daughter of immigrants, and has a passion for justice. Like us, she is a happy warrior in the battle for the soul of America. We will spend every minute of the next 85 days making sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris replace Trump  Pence
Agree,  Can and should however point out her Leftist Senate Voting r√©cord and the Biden/Harris  Leftist Agenda!
Of course!!!!! Go Biden/Harris!!!!
You call this ‚Äúleadership‚Äù??!! In my world this government overreach or #communism. No thank you. Not in my country üá∫üá∏
Who is 'they'? Are you talking about democrats? Biden, Harris?  You are fearmongering, which can be argued is not Christian - especially when there are no facts to support it.
Biden isn't the one playing politics. You are. Case and point. You went to
And yet, Biden has a dog. And Trump doesn't.
It makes sense Kamala was chosen by Biden. Her family owned slaves and Biden is quoted as saying "I'll be damned if I will pay reparations for the sins of my father and grandfather ". Google it. And then watch the deflecting.
They've also killed more ppl than Obama/Biden. 160,000+ and growing. That's just the pandemic, doesn't include mass shootings and bountied soldiers. Also more lies than anyone in any admin. More corruption than admin.
If ever there was a reason to INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE this is it - Judge Jeanine Makes Ominous Biden Prediction   Why did she say that? Does she know something? Is she psychic or psycho?

He and   would be fast friends seeing as how they both have that ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anything...‚Äù alibi going on. #ChildMolestor
I agree!! Why did they have that #sourpuss  on after Biden/Harris speech. I changed it quick to #CNN He brought my excitement to the ground when he spoked .. ugh!!  needs to get his butt out!!

I am convinced that everything is concerning the  team because America has enough of the #ConMan and his cronies trying to sabotage the American Dream to benefit their rich friends. üá∫üá∏Biden/Harris
Joe Biden picked such an excellent VP in Kamala Harris.  She is a super strong speaker and never backs down from any fight on the horizon.  Kamala Harris also has her facts at hand and whips out her responses so fast that she makes your head spin.

Dr. Irwin Redlener joins to explain why the choice of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate makes a lot of sense in the middle of a pandemic.
He just heard Biden's pick
Senator Harris and VP Biden, make me hopeful for our democracy, our civil rights, equal justice for all and the  rule of law. Her soul and Biden‚Äôs are in stark contrast to Trump‚Äôs lack of everything, empty suit~stupid tie~
Kamala Harris now kneels down to the racist Biden. After years of fighting RACISM, she now accepts it
Biden saved big bucks using payroll tax loophole
Sleepy Joe Biden.
or that he knows better than the CDC, Fauci, or any scientists at all, for that matter. No, Biden will be a team player rather than a crazy, and I mean crazy, autocrat.
He also has Obama, a much respected and admired past president as his mentor, advisor, and supporter. He is surrounding himself with good people because, evidently, he doesn't think he is the chosen one, he alone can fix it, that he is a stable genius,
KAMALA HARRIS. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF BIDEN WINS. SHE WILL BE THE ONE WITH THE CODES. BIDEN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ZIP CODE HE LIVES IN. KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENT. LET THAT SINK IN
For democrats, This purity test needs to be stopped . No candidate will satisfy everyone. Biden,&amp; Harris are millions times better thanTrump and his swamp.If you can‚Äôt see that ( many of them show themselves in the comments here. You are helping to re-elect Trump for another 4yrs
was for her before he was against her.Trump has become irrelevant.  He is nasty, mean, insulting and low class. He is going down on November 3, and he knows it.  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!!!üíô
Wonderful choice! She is one tough prosecutor and will make a wonderful VP. Great choice, Biden. We support you!    VOTE! And will mop with Trump and Pence the Hill's  watch out Miss Lindsey don't get in the way  üá∫üá∏Biden/Harris2020
I was not happy with the way she torpedoed VP Biden during the debates but she's tough and if she is his choice I will support this ticket 500% to get this country away from this constant hatespeak and delusions perpetrated by the current administration.
Kamala Harris is born on Oct. 20th, and Joe Biden was born on Nov. 20th. That is definitely 2020. If I am Pence, I‚Äôll be afraid, very afraid !!!  Let‚Äôs debate !!!She has a mouthpiece.
Bring it on   No body give a damn. I will still vote for Biden. Who would believe a attorney whose former clients were Russian Oligarchs...No one fucking believes #barr anymodu. #LyingDogs
He just wants to get back into vote for Biden then he wont have to Sneak anymore! And he can have a lot of his buddies come here to help him with his hobby. THATS WHAT DEFUNDING THE POLICE AND VOTING DEMONCRAT WILL GET FOR YOU.
More breaking news today.   Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate.  #Election2020
Lmao run away you coward...not surprised you are unable to back up your claims, about as much I can expect from a Biden fan
Sure they have. And trump is going to have our government buy millions of doses and foist them on us just before the election and claim credit to get reelected. My October surprise will be I'll already have voted for Biden.
Either way it's going to be an issue, but most importantly Biden has to take into consideration the "Electorial" snowflakes who will have a problem with a woman!
Idiots ..Biden is not the president ..Your moron is and he has not done nothing for this #TrumpVirus he has  leadership on this Pandemic. BIDEN IS DOING MUCH MORE OrangeMan is playing golf most of the time.

TRUMPSHIT! UNCONSTITUTIONAL  AND MORE SMOKE AND MIRRORS!
COME LETS GIVE EQUAL TIME TO BIDEN? ESPECIALLY SINCE HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME TALKING?
On day one Biden should sign an executive order that cancels each and every one of Trump's EOs and list them so that it's clear they are canceled. "The following EOs are hereby declared null and void...."
China is Communist we have fought them in Cuba, N .Korea, Vietnam THEY ARE OUR ENEMY! They KNOWINGLY released a Virus on the world, Costing TRILLIONS in DESTROYED Economies and Killed over 1 million people WITHOUT FIRING a SHOT. You want Biden to STAND UP TO THEM?

I wonder if  depression deepens today when Trump bails out the country? Is she still trying to process Biden calling integration a "racial jungle" and advocating on behalf of his constituents to keep Delaware schools segregated? Come on Man, that would depress me!
Thinking Harris just because she's limiting her public appearances now until her surgery heals (last TV appearance was a disaster and way too early) but has tweeted multiple pro Biden messages like something from a VP campaign.
How did Biden's turn out the other day. Come on man, do blacks really have no diversity? I'm pretty sure that won't go over well in my family.
I think Kamala Harris will not go over well with older Biden supporters. Too independent to be a teammate to Biden. I think Rice would be a better choice due to her ties to European leaders, her knowledge of Foreign Policy and the fact she worked closely with  Biden for years.
Biden isn't going to take guns away. He can't. Stop listening to Trump's b.s., turn off Fox news, and read the Constitution.  The GOP is taking things away: mail-in ballots, Social Security, Medicaid/Medicare, Health care, raising taxes on middle/low income earners...

How do Biden's boots taste?

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
Biden/Harris supporters are stupid
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
That is indeed laughable! Again, just like the "cages" were installed in the Obama-Biden administration, so too the removal of postal boxes also began in the Obama-Biden administration.
And still no Biden signs...
Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere

CBS says Wall Street breathes "sigh of relief" at Harris pick. Well, Job Exporting Wall Street is the enemy of working people so expect Harris to be, too - no matter what phony claims are laid on to get elected. Harris and Biden are Corporate Shills from way back.

Arizona‚Äôs superintendent of public instruction Kathy Hoffman formally endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, arguing their administration would better serve Arizona public schools.
Joe Biden has had 40 years and done nothing. Obama had 8 years and did nothing. Why would you even consider voting for these people?
I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument
Ask Biden, her own running mate
This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Does anyone doubt the plan is to crash it the day after Biden wins?
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Biden is beginning Alzheimers candidate instead of president material.  You want Kamala Harris correcting his fuck ups ?
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.
Krazy Kamala is a liberal who shouldn't be anywhere near the White House.  Put her next to Biden in the White House and then you're going the wrong way that Trump works for in building up this country üôÑ.

Are you honestly telling me that you think insulting people is a good campaign strategy?? Are you honestly passing yourself off as the Bernie supporter gatekeeper?? Let me guess; if (when?) Biden loses you'll blame Bernie supporters [again].
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
Kamala calls Joe Biden a racist and then switches up and is now his running mate but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think these people are gonna switch up once their in office ü§°
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA

oh great a Greta taking questions and answering them honestly are 2 miles apart in his realm. I just listened to this recent one and there was almost not a fact in there! Seriously Greta do you do your homework?? Biden will!

If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.

Haha. You're just spewing right wing talking points. A front for progressive agenda? That's just a way to paint Biden as a radical when it's really hard. You have to find a way to do this. So you say he's a Trojan horse. It's a tactic because a moderate would snatch Republicans
Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

YES that's true but in all probability Trump will cause more. It's been estimated that Trump's policies will cause 587,982,026.254 problems and that Joe Biden's policies will cause 327,982,781.982 problems. so You can see there is a considerable difference. YOU HAVE TO VOTE 4 JOE

trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...

Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...

Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.

So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶

The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?

Haven‚Äôt liked Biden since the Anita Hill debacle. His trashing of Hillary made it worse. Will always b mad that this past admin did nothing 2 support Hillary during her run &amp; did nothing 2 halt the fraudulent election outcome. If Putin steals another election, will Joe blame Hil?

Why did Symone Sanders and Biden advise people in my home state it was safe to vote in person during a pandemic. #hypicrites
you are in style Linda!!! The Tee looks great !!! Keeps Sporting it !! Biden/Harris 2020!!
since the USPS mail carriers UNION is endorosing Biden, is that considered a conflict of interest? Especially since the mail in ballots / envelopes are easy to identify as Dem or Repub ballot. Be smart and vote in person. Help prevent voter fraud / vote harvesting.
Have you endorsed Biden yet?
The orange criminal strikes again.  Conspiracy theories, lies, and slander. Oh yeah...and a war on the US Postal Service.   Fact check: Trump promotes another¬†birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Everyone: ‚ÄúJoe Biden needs to get out of his basement, it‚Äôs less than 3 months from Election Day‚Äù  Joe Biden: names Kamala Harris his VP, has two media gatherings, heads back to his basement, no questions asked
Not to worry. The Postal Workers union, responsible for getting ballots in, endorsed Biden.
Biden family better get that Ukraine story straight, because its gonna knockout slow Joe the second he debates.
I would take any version of Biden over Trump...childish names and all.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
We saw your hatred for Trump, not one word about the socialist plans Biden has for our country, you don't care about the country only your hatred for Trump..we saw you.
Saw you on PBS, didn't hear 1 thing that you agree with Biden on, no discussion of his plans for the country, just how much you hate Trump, you don't care about the country just your hatred of the President.
For the record: I'm going to follow everyone in this little sub-tweet!

Just like Joe Biden she is not mentally fit to be VP.  she has ideas that are clearly anti constitutional.  Vote Trump
You believe the racist sexual predator who wrote the Biden crime bill and the lady who used the Biden crime bill to imprison thousands of people for victimless crimes who were disproportionately from minority communities is voting in their best interest.
Oh i agree i just think its funny Biden/AOC could litearlly show the world how corrupt they are :(.
Maybe not Biden but most of the Dem candidates literally kike beto, buttigeg ect, all the shitty centrists say medicare as a public option and your like nah propaganda
Yep and the #DummiesforDictators  Are going to try to vote in Biden and Harris.
Gee if only the  would have nominated the guy filling stadiums instead of manipulating the system against him. Biden/Harris is about as energizing as dryer lint.
Not the same thing as stuffing the ballot box‚Äôs which the Biden/Harris team is advocating for

But if they would have endorsed Biden you would have been alright with it #idiot
Here's the deal. I've been pressing my secret sources in DC for the inside scoop on whats happening with the Biden/Harris Campaign. Here's the Top secret, inside the beltway, not for release! Biden Cabinet picks. Do NOT let this out!
You shouldn‚Äôt have to ask.  Vote Biden
Biden's assured his 'sponsors': "nothing will change".   If Biden cared as much about the uninsured as he does his Insurance company donors he'd support M4A like 89% of Democrats. ObamaBiden started a genocide in Yemen. FUCKING GENOCIDE! I'm insane but YOU'RE supporting GENOCIDE!

Next you're going to use phrenology to tell us Biden and Harris are horrible. *rolls eyes*
Let's have #Biden take the Norwegian IQ test, just for fun.
And so it begins! USPS just announced their Priority mail will be delayed 2-3 days and Flat Rate from 5-7 days to 7-9 days and now 9-12 days! Of course they also support Joe Biden. What could go wrong with this termite infested ship of insanity?
Vote for Biden.  He‚Äôs better than the alternative!
Consider voting Biden- the world needs more red pill moments like this.
It has always been. Do Trump or Biden care about California or Texas (for presidential election)?
let me get this straight, he convinced his supporters that covid was a hoax, so that they would all vote in person, while simultaneously dismantling the postal system for biden voters? ü§î
Biden won‚Äôt make it through the election...  Thankfully President Trump will be re-elected, crisis averted. üò∞
Well, the postal workers union could be the one organizing the lost ballots. I‚Äôve got an idea on how to ensure accurate votes - in person with an ID. Elections shouldn‚Äôt be about which side is the best cheat.

I think we need to follow the lead of our candidates. But if every single Democrat hasn‚Äôt contacted at least 100 people to encourage their support for #BIDEN/HARIS2020, then no, we‚Äôre not doing enough!
Biden is a decent man who will not steal from the American people. He won‚Äôt lie about Covid. He won‚Äôt hire incompetent grifters! How can anyone compare Biden with Trump? Biden won‚Äôt destroy democracy.
If we bully Biden that number will go down to 4998!

Don't let these right wing grifters fool you! They are salivating at a Biden Presidency, it will be like 2012 all over again for these fucks!
I think Biden wins the election but Trump remains president.  There will be a constitutional crisis of some sort because a Nixon-like resignation and pardon isn‚Äôt likely if the investigations are legit. Idk, man. I just want the truth one way or another.
I think Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP choice pushed independents and Libertarians away from the Biden Camp
You think Joe Biden is against white Supremacist...
is there a single video of biden clearly stating his desire to do any of these things?
You're the one comparing Biden to Hitler instead of Trump to Hitler. As a doctor you should encourage people to wear a mask.
How about 'Vice President Biden'
Just heard or saw another anti Biden Democrat commercial in AZ with Sam Elliot‚Äôs voice.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs him, maybe do something about that!!
This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
Question to  and  : Are you both planning to admit the injustices your policies had on families and pardon some of those cases? #Biden2020  Can we talk about the dark side of the moon üåö? . #BuildTrust #BeHonest #unFairJustice
You don‚Äôt have to like him, but Trump has done a damn good job. Whether you like them or not, Biden and Harris both have terrible track records in office. And, they want to take the US in the opposite direction that had us flourishing as a country. No thanks.
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
Despite the drama-evoking click-baity title of this article, it is a wonderful read, delving into the political intelligence differences between Biden and Obama. I see a generational thing going on, but the strengths Biden brings to politics shouldn‚Äôt  be overlooked.
Regardless of what Biden says, President Trump is doing the better than any other country with COVID19.
Hmmmm, so you recently saw the light after 40 years in public service? Oh, would the person handling this account for Mr. Biden please ask the question, as he does not know how to tweet, just saying.
Silly Hilly, If we wanted to fix it, we wouldn't be accepting Biden.
That was Biden.
The Biden/Obama administration also caged children, murdered civilians, and fucked over the working class just as hard.
Well everyone you should asked Biden and Harris since they raised 50 million dollars in two days  maybe they should give everyone 1200 dollars or as much as they can until the Democrats come back from there break.
Oh I fully understand. And I have absolutely ZERO hope that a Biden/Harris administration will be even an iota better for the working class.
My mom, who‚Äôs had a heart attack and lobectomy by 50 has covid. She doesn‚Äôt even want me to come home bc she‚Äôs afraid I will catch the virus and it will kill me. That‚Äôs how sick she is. She‚Äôs a nurse, she wears a mask. I can‚Äôt imagine not seeing her again. #covid  #trump #biden

Voting for Joe "nothing will fundamentally change" Biden isn't gonna help a damned thing.
What racial issues? Literally it‚Äôs been the same for decades. When has there ever NOT been a racial divide in this country. Biden has come out to support better support for the battle against climate change and has announced some policy about it. Also we waited too long to close
If Biden was a stronger candidate he‚Äôd already be pushing trump to issue masks to citizens, but instead he puts out an ad about how he will do that immediately come next late January. Sweeeeet.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

Who forced anyone to take drugs?  By the way it was the 94 crime bill created by Biden that did that. Please get your facts and time frame straight. Clinton was President and signed it.
Trump won both states in 2016. My state of Arizona is no longer a guaranteed red state. I expect Arizona to vote for a Democratic President and Senator. McSally has been a disaster for Republican's

You are a troll on education and AZ.  Political puppet. You‚Äôre just holding out so Biden and you can ‚Äúbe the education saviors‚Äù but what you‚Äôre forgetting is that you everyone sees you‚Äôre terrible people. The ends do NOT justify the means! All the angry parents are focused on you
Trump doesn't want mail in ballot because it can be rigged.  By the by . Who wants a feeble like Biden in office who can't make a quick wise decision in office anyway. Trump didn't become successful having Alzheimers.

So he's saying Biden-Harris will lose? Sounds good to me.
I find Joe Biden voters more repulsive than Trumpers. By a land slide! The difference is one can say and get away w/ more than the other! I view a vote for Biden as a vote for mainstream socialism and government expansion.
we can vote trump out while holding biden/kamala accountable for their atrocious careers
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.

My FB friends seem to understand that electing Biden doesn't fix anything (other than the issue of Trump of course) and know we will have to keep up the pressure, even increase it, IF he is elected...but seeing far too many who think he is the solution.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù

It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.
Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
And now....more lies and conspiracy theories out of the trump camp about our VP. He is an endless liar. We have to have Kamala's back.  Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
No we don't think Joe Biden is bad &amp; Kamala Harris is a strong, bad ass woman. They are a terrific team who will clean up Trump's mess. The GOP is going down &amp; it's a beautiful thing to watch #DumpTrump2020  #WorstPresidentEverArizona Republican: I'm voting Biden because 'I'm so disgusted'
You are correct Mr President there is something going on, they are hiding the failing health of mr Biden... we the people see this and have your back. You Sir have our Vote and always have. Thank you
If you were Biden, who would be in your cabinet? Who would you pick for Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General?
When Jimmy said it he was right. Progressives would have a better chance to make noise with Trump than with Hillary. The problem is no matter who is pres they will shut down real progress. Biden will lead to Trump 2.0 or someone just like him. We're fucked!
2 options  (A) live a peaceful life under Biden  (B) continue living in chaos under trump ?????????!!!!!???????!!!!????!!
This shit is relentless. And exhausting. And it's like corruption whack-a-mole. This guy installed nothing but toadies to dismantle every part of USG to destroy us from within. That all said, NOTHING will keep me from voting for Biden/Harris in November.
I mean it seems convenient to hold only Joe Biden responsible for that crime bill when he was not the only one in government at the time. Did Bernie Sanders sign it, did Nancy Pelosi? What about Warren? Let's check on everyone who was in office in 94 and call them all out.
If you think Biden is even remotely like Trump you should really do some research. Your mindset is why Trump is in office now. It's unfortunate and unrealistic for you to think things can't get worse cause believe me they can.
Oh i am thrilled as well... TRUMP 2020 üòÅüòÅüá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤ BUMBLEING biden has made this happen for sure now thank you dim dems.
THANK. YOU!!!! I swear Democrats historically shoot themselves in the feet. There are no perfect candidates. That is a sadly unrealistic idea but you know what....I can sleep within Biden/Harris in the white house. I won't wake up wondering what new abomination has happened.
I have my electric panties on since Biden announced Kamala as his VP pick.ü§£üòÇü§£ I‚Äôm Zipping through to November 3rdü§£üòÇü§£zzzppppp!!!!
At this point in 2020, we can assume just one thing. Joe Biden thinks Kamala Harris smells better than any other female, black democrat.
He used shot to describe Biden a while back, didn‚Äôt he...üò¨
He‚Äôs upset that we aren‚Äôt making progress. 70% of the country want Universal Healthcare but Dems vote 125-36 to keep it off platform. Corrupt as fuck. Biden said nothing would fundamentally change if he‚Äôs elected. So wages stay low and working people people still struggle üôÑ
I look forward to being able to sleep through the night again (and maybe drink less alcohol) after Biden/Harris are sworn in in 01/2021. There are a ton of things to fix, nothing is perfect, but it'll be a damn good start.
I heard pence locked himself in the restroom after he heard Biden picked Kamala. He‚Äôs crying ü§£üòÇü§£
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Why in the fuck every time I refresh my screen on Twitter, a fucking Joe Biden tweet is always there ?
I can‚Äôt wait for November to come and go and Joe Biden is President. The press are just as complicit as trump. I‚Äôm sick of the press already. They are morons.
A man of faith Joe Biden.
build back better. BIDEN 2020Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.
And Biden has yet to take any questions this week. See a difference here? ü§î
Did Lara secretly think Biden would pick her???
Shaddup, Biden pendants! Lets riot!
To bad Biden doesn‚Äôt take questions
Might want to check the math. Add to that, I don‚Äôt see you complaining that Biden has taken zero questions. Funny how that works
Cesar Cisneros, I‚Äôm suspendeding my candidacy for president for 2020. I‚Äôm endorsing President Donald J.Trump for President 2020. Please vote for president Trump. Do not vote for Joe Biden ,Joe Biden will hurt Our Nation severely. May God bless America.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
Pequot Lakes, Minnesota. Brother in law commanderring his boat, literally a Trump boat parade. I was floored at the amount pro-Trump flags on houses/cabins lining the lakes. Not 1 piece of Biden paraphernalia.
Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
Kamala calls Joe Biden a racist and then switches up and is now his running mate but y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think these people are gonna switch up once their in office ü§°
But apparently you don‚Äôt see a problem with the postal service union endorsing Biden and democrats concurrently pushing a mail in ballot this November.
You are NOT  the leadership we need. Higher taxes, open border, infringe on 2A, social programs we can‚Äôt afford .  No thank you.  Pass on Biden and Harris !
If Biden/Harris win in Nov we‚Äôre gonna sadly find out.
Democrats And Biden Are So UNHINGED And Broken That Even Obama SLAMMED B...  via
Google is now changing search results to show content about Biden when I search Trump - TRUE STORY! #google #censorship
Serious question, who is more likely to seize power if Joe Biden wins and is incapacitated within his first year?
I am aware both sides are blind to their candidates misdeeds. I am not blind to the fact that 8 women have accused Biden of sexual misconduct or that Biden Wrote and defends the Biden Crime Bill or the most disgusting act of racism between the two is Biden being pro-segregation
Still Cali though... I‚Äôve got half a dozen banners on fences around my golf course. üôÑ  Do have one Biden banner... right next to the guy that has three Trump 2020 ones, so there‚Äôs that!
Yeah women for Biden.....
Bella, you realize how stupid you sound? Trump donating his salary for 4 years is only $1.4 million dollars. His golfing every weekend has cost YOU, me, and taxpayers over $140 million. Biden making billions from China is a 5 star Pinocchio lie! Maybe Putin has answers for you?
And postal worker union endorsed Biden out of survival mode.
Wow wow wow i want to see the poll for The CHAMP Trump 2020 right now.  Your guys make me so great for the awsome leader can make AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  SLEEPY Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the worst candidate, defund cops, crimes up, America goes down to her knees.
You going to like when Biden takes most of your money or be in California where they will be taxing the celebrities up to 70% ?? You like working when the government gets more of your money than you do ??
Hi my name is Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Animals endorse Joe Biden üêæ‚ù§ #BidenHarris2020
Is that an early picture of Biden?
Better question, can Joe Biden? #DementiaJoe
If the issue is Ducey then we need to fire/recall Ducey. Not sure how voting for Biden helps. The Dems are the ones playing games more so then the GOP at the moment and if not for Trump signing the EOs we still wouldn‚Äôt have shit coming to us.
I think many feel Biden has already won, but just like the first time around I believe the Moron can actually win again one way or another. I just hope if nothing else the senate can be flipped and the house stays as is and if he gets in they can make it impossible for him to do
Well he travels around the country and didnt know the Chiefs were in Missouri and called Colorado a border state. They both are a mess, but if you think Trump isn‚Äôt on that same level as Biden I don‚Äôt know what you are watching.
It‚Äôs truly insane to be honest how many people refuse to publicly even speak Trumps name out loud, but will be honestly voting for him in November. I don‚Äôt trust these polls as far as I throw them. I agree. The lead has to be 15 or more for Biden to feel somewhat secure
I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.
Attacking Biden because they can‚Äôt come up with any accomplishments to talk about?  Or any plans he has for the country going forward?  Got it I think I will listen to Joe Biden. üò∑ #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.
Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Ummm...Greg I didn‚Äôt make up the nickname for Hiden Biden   ‚Äú1% Joe" ‚Äî  an insulting reference to Biden's past performances in the 1988 and 2008 Democratic primaries.
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.
Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

Rally the troops by supporting The Lincoln Project, voting for Biden/Harris, and restoring the country‚Äôs health, wealth, and honor.  Dismantle Trumpery. Don‚Äôt be a snowflake for Don the Con and Jared the jughead.
"For all his klutziness and indiscretions, Biden‚Äôs overall message appeals to our better angels and hopes, while Trump‚Äôs appeals to our demons and fears."
So Hunter &amp; James Biden (Joe's brother) have been making money off the family name because of Joe being Senator/VP for a long time. That doesn't change the fact Joe is running against the WORST President ever &amp; we'll still vote for him. The Trump crime family is the greater evil.
It votes for Biden or it gets the Trump again.
Isn't that the point of the choice?  Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'  #FoxNews
Those that trust Trump on the economy need to remember, it was Biden who oversaw the 2009 Recovery act. Trump actually did nothing for the economy but ride on Biden's coattails.
Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden???
She doesn‚Äôt just think he‚Äôs a racist. She thinks he‚Äôs a creeper too.
Lol, you‚Äôre gonna be dissapointed then. Nobody wants a mentally dabilitated Biden and a murderous Kamala Harris
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
President Joe Biden. Inmate Donald Trump. Pass it on.
These soft drinks are really bad for the human race and is 1 of the leading causes of OBESITY, empty calories. Even the Diet ones which have chemicals we have not come to understand. Since the Plandemic I've lost 30 lbs ,I quit eating FF n drinking sodas!
The problem with this is that it‚Äôs a hypothetical situation. Nobody knows how many people could be killed by a Biden admin because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. With Trump, we already know and it‚Äôs getting worse every day.
The definitive piece on Biden came from Harper's called "No Joe" ... it's been called a "hit piece" or biased. Harper's has never failed a fact check.  It spells out his record disturbingly.  The Guardian piece I referenced
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
I did a lot of research into Biden a year ago. What I found disturbed me greatly. Joe spent 40 years as a Senator who never once sided w/the people against corporate America. Dems make excuses for him all the time. I despise Trump but wanted so much better. From the Guardian:
From the BIDEN Republicans
This is still bothering me. We're quite literally living through the United States turning to fascism and half of Twitter is "Lol, check out these forever stamps you guys #hashtags" while the other half is "It's not fascism, but if Biden wins it'll be instant Marxism."
He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.
I'm sure Nancy Pelosi and JOe Biden do the same to help out their constituents (LOL).
I‚Äôm saying it now. President Biden.
Joe Biden fundamentally doesn't understand how our government works and is 100% unqualified to run this country. Governors don't make laws, the legislature does. Any "mandates" by governors or the president are illegal  and unenforceable #unmaskamerica #covidlies #NeverBiden
you are the one doing political interference by attempting to interfere with the Presidential election to help Biden, do you really think people are too dumb to see what you are doing?
No, fascists Biden and Harris: You cannot mandate #masks.  They have been proven to be a health hazard, and you cannot mandate a health hazard. Here's the proof:
The Media and the Democratic party are babysitting Biden.
They just doing what they told  Right now USPS &gt; anything  The way it should be  Joe Biden pedo &gt; everything
She‚Äôs a liar. She doesn‚Äôt even like Biden. She‚Äôs just trying to be president
For those interested in knowing. god it‚Äôs nothing like we wanted but we need to settle and do what we can. PLEASE vote Biden this 2020 election
What  just told me that my third party vote was a vote for Trump. Lucky me My vote is now 3 times as valuable as yours. My vote for  counts as a vote for her plus as a vote for Biden and as a vote for Trump. My vote is super powerful üòÇü§£üòÇ
I demand you do everything you can to force Biden to take a cognizant test by Sept 15th we need that. We also need for these People out of our Government please do everything possible. Start finding ways.
Obama says Biden has a knack of f'ing up everything. BFF's
Democrats scrambling to push mail voting! They know Biden cant win otherwise. If you can show up the thousands for protests, You can go to polls to vote! Its that simple!
I like presidents who weren't born rich. They understand what it's like to struggle. They learned empathy,  Biden &amp; Harris understand. Obama &amp; Clinton understood.   tRump was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, which he swallowed &amp; pooped out.   #VoteBlue2020  #BidenHarris2020
Who knows what Joe Biden wants? He doesn't answer any questions.  What a snake.
So funny when demolition rats hear an opposing view point or one they they don‚Äôt like you say Russia Russia Russia or BOT! Lol  We All know why Biden‚Äôs campaign doesn‚Äôt allow questions!

I‚Äôm Joe Message and I approve this Biden lol üòÇ
Calling an option a fact doesn‚Äôt make it a fact I strongly believe both candidates will abuse the power of the office. As for minorities Biden was pro segregation and was defending his crime bill just a few years ago. Pre Covid Trump had the lowest Minority unemployment on record
How Biden‚Äôs grief for his son helped lead him to Harris
Joe Biden is a clear cut racist but getting a pass, like how republicans give trump a pass for their ‚Äúparty‚Äù we deserve better than 2 racist old men
Even male actors don't put their arms around women for photos anymore to show they aren't sexually assaulting the woman. . It's easy to accuse sexual assault. It is a genuinely disgusting problem. I want to give both sides the benefit of doubt. With Biden.... WTF
Started with Beto O'Rourke and worked my down. I think Biden was the weakest of all Dems running.
Kamala Harris and Biden only one will be in charge and it's not Uncle Joe. Harris will try to run the country because Biden cannot. Kamala cannot run the country. Foreign affairs Iran North Korea China she has no experience to stand up to these countries. Just a bobblehead.

Watching Biden and Harris they're always asked questions. But we never get any answers instead leave the room with no answers 2 questions asked. What are they afraid of? I guess they don't have answers. Well sooner or later they will have to answer questions in debates. We'll see

Not to worry. The Postal Workers union, responsible for getting ballots in, endorsed Biden.
I would take any version of Biden over Trump...childish names and all.
We saw your hatred for Trump, not one word about the socialist plans Biden has for our country, you don't care about the country only your hatred for Trump..we saw you.
Saw you on PBS, didn't hear 1 thing that you agree with Biden on, no discussion of his plans for the country, just how much you hate Trump, you don't care about the country just your hatred of the President.
Josh ,vote for Biden . He has been a career politician for 50 years. What has he done to get this country ready for the Corona Virus ? What has he done to make this a better country but of course it will all change we Biden is in charge
You believe the racist sexual predator who wrote the Biden crime bill and the lady who used the Biden crime bill to imprison thousands of people for victimless crimes who were disproportionately from minority communities is voting in their best interest.
Yep and the #DummiesforDictators  Are going to try to vote in Biden and Harris.
But if they would have endorsed Biden you would have been alright with it #idiot

This was pretty eye opening....  (If Biden actually is the nominee.... I have a feeling the DNC might change nominees before the convention due to health concerns - IMO)
It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.
This makes perfect sense. IMO he is being BLACKMAILED by Harris.

How selfless of her! I hear she's good at cleaning up problems #Bleachbit   #FoxNews
You trashed Biden at the debate, now you lie and say he's great. You said Biden picked a black woman, but your mother is from india? Typical shady, wishy washy politician.
Not trusted. Your bias, misleading,  you have become involved in politics, now untrustworthy. You show Biden speaking but not my president? I don't care about your personal hangups with the man, I want all the news. Call yourself most trusted, that's BULL.
LOL. Isn't it sad that the only thing the GOP has is this made up false narrative? Creating a boogeyman then accusing the eternal Moderate Biden of being that boogeyman. Mud and lies is the only thing that the GOP has to fight with. No accomplishments, no aspirations.
Here we go.  Enter Michelle.   Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Short clip from Beau Biden. It's wonderful.
JOE BIDEN HAS NO CLUE!  via
is out here telling us to vote Biden/Harris and then has just released a video that is calling for end of cash bail. Pathetic.
Biden sold us, America, out in so many ways to foreign powers. He clearly doesn‚Äôt put America first which is why Trump will win in November.
I honestly liked his take that Marx and Lenin would be Bernie staffers endorsing Biden  I would pay to see that happen
You can replace ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù with ‚ÄúObama‚Äù or ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and your narrative remains true.
Biden cozied up to our enemies? Maybe it was to assault them, as is the republican narrative completely forgetting their rapist-in-chief? Or was it how Biden calls Putin privately while tacitly OK-img the pay-for-murder of American soldiers? Oh wait, that was your guy too.
I didn‚Äôt realize he felt that strongly about Biden
Postal workers endorse Joe Biden. #Biden2020
Fuckin SAME  but for now it's just biden harris :/
Vote for Biden by all means! Honestly he can‚Äôt wreak the amount of havoc America that Trump has (and will do even more if he‚Äôs re-elected.
Uhhh... Joe Biden is the one who claimed he would defund social security. We need to replace SS with an individual investment account that is tied to a hedge fund that gov isn‚Äôt allowed to steal money from unlike SS. IIA‚Äôs are the only way to go. Everyone would retire with $1m+
I feel like a racist jackass assuming just because of the last name jumping to that conclusion. But at least I didn‚Äôt pull a Biden and ask if either of them ran a 7-11.
let‚Äôs entertain this hypothetical for a moment  in this case, assuming the 6,000 comes from Trump, Biden signifies a 1,000 person net gain in # of lives saved (unironically good)  of course, the hypothetical is a hypothetical. in a non-hypothetical sense, there‚Äôs no other choice.
This is the first decent Biden tweet ive seen.  Too bad he didn't come up with it
The Chinese and Gov Cuomo are responsible for the deaths. Maybe you need to go back and look at the timeline, what the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù were saying, Biden calling Trump xenophobic for closing down boarder and Pelosi encouraging everyone to come to Chinatown to celebrate w/o a mask.
Vote for biden!!!!
Biden and Harris better light some sage up in there before they move in
Aside from not being the one who would take office? A vote for Biden is really a vote for Harris at this point. If that motivates you.
Lmao Biden spent his whole career doing nothing for the left and now he‚Äôs the democratic nominee and supported by every major progressive leader. Let‚Äôs start a new party now!
How is our country gone forever if Biden wins??? We did just fine when he was VP
Is Joe Biden a communist?
" ain‚Äôt right" because Joe Biden didn't pick Stacey Abrams as his VP running mate? So stupid &amp; divisive.  1) Was Abrams promised the VP position? 2) You, I assume, know the harm caused by racism, yet YOU are being a racist by rejecting Kamala as a Black woman. #nuts
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake
Because Biden didn't choose her as his VP running mate? Seriously? Strange you didn't mention Republican Jack Kemp who ACTUALLY DID screw over Stacey Abrams. He threw 10% off voter rolls, removed polling places from Black neighborhoods, rejected 53,000 mail-in ballots... #Facts
No - Trump has them looking into Biden.  I no linger believe in the independence if the FBI Rosenstein proved they have MAGA in leadership.

Vote for Biden, keep working to make things better. With Trump there is no way to correct anything, no chance whatsoever to make things better. Btw, I try telling this to Libertarians dead set on promoting and voting for only the Libertarian candidate‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not having it.
If I were working for team Biden at this point I would start buying as many N95 masks as possible to donate to supporters who will have to stand in long lines on election day.  Request the day off now, and wear a mask, it's the only way to save the Republic and democracy.
Biden is center to center-right. The ‚Äúcentrists‚Äù in the party are just corporatists, imperialists and standard banners of the same status-quo shit that gave us Trump.

All you do is complain about meaningful change. Well, here‚Äôs a piece of information that it actually RELEVANT instead of senseless whining: you won‚Äôt get anything done if you don‚Äôt elect Biden. If you want change, vote, or you‚Äôll never see that change happen.
But in the spirit of talking about creepy pervs in politics, let‚Äôs look back at your main man, Biden. Have you just been in a cave this whole time? Or are you blatantly ignoring VERY similar claims against him, simply bc some of the policies he believes in align with your morals?
Damn right! Let's get this virus under control. Everyone can wear a mask for the protection of everyone else. It's the decent and patritotic thing to do for our country.  Biden calls for mask mandates in all 50 states: 'It's about saving Americans' lives'
What outcome are you looking for? More of what we‚Äôre living through or a team, Biden/Harris, that can start to heal the country and save our democracy? Kamala was my choice for top of the ticket and I personally think she‚Äôs Biden choice too. Get me?
FYI-the Repubs, Ron Johnson and some other low-lifes are doing "investigating" again to smear Obama and the Bidens.  Get tough Team Biden/Harris. trump is corrupt to the very core. How dare they continually bring up Obama or the Bidens. We don't back down. #BidenHarris2020

Yesterday during my FB live, I used the example of Biden's movement on the Hyde Amendment. He moved because he was pushed by progressives and organizations like Planned Parenthood. He wasn't moved by silence and capitulation. He was moved by activism and accountability. 2/

Biden is not behind these superficial statements. Mandated masks is a leftist power/control grab, from the DNC oligarchy.
Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical to defeating Trump. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.
I really appreciate Joe Biden wanting to force people to wear masks for their own good sincerely Satan
i mean has she said anything that would indicate she's not anti-capitalist? her view that ppl should vote for biden to prevent trump reelection is a valid one, whether you agree with it or not (your view is valid too, although i disagree with it). it doesn't make her a lib
we have valid reasons for voting for biden as well. we won't consider voting green because we don't think they can win. i live a state that has shifted from red to purple, my vote actually matters and can affect the outcome. it's different for ppl in solid red/blue states
Cuomo is as brainless as Pelosi, Biden, Harris and anyone else who would be stupid enough to put a patient in a nursing home being positive for covid-19. Try again.

Biden has been wrong about everything for 40 years the only thing he holds steady on is his constant racism! #Trump2020 #NowMoreThanEver
Biden is trying to mandate wearing masks for 3 months, and then adds he would talk to the governors about mandating. In other words, he is being the authoritarian but admits that decision is up to the states, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP IS DOING
I agree James! Biden is so far ahead in the polls it reminds me of the night trump won!
at the very least, we *know* that trump will continue to accelerate the pandemic. we don't know if biden will or not (but most likely he won't). so we have a better gamble with biden on this issue
And Biden ahead in the polls! Oh it‚Äôs MSM polls overseen by fact checkers! ü§£ü§£
. is right. As a delegate to the  I joined with him &amp; 100s of Biden, Bernie &amp; Warren delegates in voting NO on the platform because it excludes #MedicareForAll.  Especially during this pandemic, it is time to #DrawTheLine and guarantee health care to all as a right.
Tulsi debunked Clinton and Harris, the DNC, Russian plant, 3rdy party spoiler conspiracy theory and did as she said she was going 2 do from day 1. Support the eventual nom. U dont see her actively push her supporters 2 vote Biden, say how Biden will b the next FDR.Bernie does tho

This might actually sway the polls in Trump's favor. If Biden is smart he won't commit to anything with her until after Nov 3.

would biden call covid-19 "the chinese virus" and claim it's a hoax to prevent his reelection? would he encourage states to hastily reopen and for his supporters to not wear masks? would he tell americans to not listen to the cdc or who? would he hold rallies in a pandemic?
okay, all true, all fair points. but would biden roll back protections for queer ppl? would biden eliminate the aca and daca? would biden write rules explicitly allowing discrimination against queer ppl? would biden incite his base to violence and spew anti-science rhetoric?
What an ass . He can‚Äôt call for anything. Watch now we will have Biden supporters with masks and the rest of the country will take them off !!!
yeah, i mean it is one issue. you need to show me how as a whole trump and biden are the same. not "they agree on these points", but "biden would cause equal the harm as trump would". i know biden is bad, but i'm still not convinced he's as bad as trump
Judicial Watch uncovered Secret Service records showing Hunter Biden traveled to China five time and also visited Moscow. But  didn‚Äôt get all the records, so JW were forced to go to court to find out more. ITS ALL BEING COVERED UP!!  WHERE ARE REPUBLICANS?? #JudicialWatch
but bringing up a single issue that he and trump are identical on doesn't argue against that. i brought up issues that trump is worse than biden on, so the appropriate thing is to counter those claims, not yell "whatabout israel??"
I keep getting reported by Biden/Harris followers.
OK, so now what do you add here? What is the contrast to Senate Democrats, which Mark Kelly would join? What is contrast to Biden/Harris?
He in fact does not have the authority to do that and neither would Joe Biden.
it was still odd for them to bring it up, because it didn't help anyone's point. trump and biden both support israel, so why mention it at all?
Sincerely, &amp; respectfully, I seek to understand.  First, know that I appreciate GOP or Ex-GOP biden votes as a sacrifice.  Thank you.  So in that context - help me - "Kamala messed up on Kavanaugh"  My objective = understand, learn.
We can and SHOULD be critical of EVERY candidate because they are not perfect and should be held accountable. While Tr*mp is the worst candidate here we shouldn‚Äôt just give Biden/Harris a free pass because they‚Äôre the lesser of two evils
There are two options in 2020 for conservatives   1. Biden wins, Republicans go back to being conservatives and win back the house and Senate in 2022 2. Trump wins, nobody ever checks the spending, we spiral out of control with debt and race riots.   There isn‚Äôt a third option.
It took a pandemic and a full country shut down to get to Obama and Biden‚Äôs highest point in the economy. So yea, keep shoveling the B.S.
I am proud of my government and how the world views the USA...‚Ä¶.Pre-2016!! I have been crying for the last 3.5 years. After watching Biden/Harris I am still crying ..... tears of happiness! Anybody else?
When I say there's no moral high ground, I mean between Trump and Biden. Their policy overlap is pretty high. It's just rhetoric that changes. I will not support someone who is evil, whether that be Trump or Biden.
Then they sure don't want their Daughters around Biden.
Lmao. Ignorance. Trump called for more testing not less. You must be a Biden Harris Fan. In that case just start giving up your rights. üòÇ
They are so stupid. Kanye will take away votes from Trump, not from Biden.
The difference Matt is that the Obama/Biden administration dealt with the problem unlike what Trump has done. See Matt, Trump ignored the growing pandemic, said it would be gone in a few weeks. Obama/Biden immediately worked on the issue, didn‚Äôt disband the pandemic response team
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
i do care about each of those. what's suspicious is that this person seems to act like israel is the worst enemy to humanity. like why bring israel into the conversation? trump and biden both support israel, so why being it up as a point against biden? it's odd to me
i already read that thread. what's your point? i don't like kamala either, but that doesn't change anything for me. in fact i dislike biden more than kamala. still not as much as i despise trump
First question do you still believe Tara Reade? Next is joe Biden still the racist you called him in your campaign?  How many men did you sleep with to reach your goals? Were they all married men
I was wrong about Biden. He‚Äôs not the incoherent bum I thought he was.
um, no, you can oppose fascism and vote for biden. in fact, we're voting for biden to prevent a fascist from staying in office
if biden were to do the same shit trump has been doing, he wouldn't get reelected. he knows that he'll have to reverse trump's policies if he's going to get a second term (that's what he's running on now). so there's also that accountability holding him to a certain standard
biden would just be the obama administration again. it is obvious that trump is far far far worse than obama. trump restricted rights of queer ppl, obama set protections (that trump later overturned). so it's a reasonable assumption that biden will not be as bad as trump
sorry but this i just can't wrap my head around. i don't see how anyone  can think trump and biden are equally bad, especially during this pandemic that trump has been accelerating through science-denialism

i'm NOT saying all this to persuade anyone to vote for biden. i'm saying this so you can understand my perspective. maybe then you can stop calling me and others "liberals" and "faux-leftists", when i'm literally an ancom. we don't need this gatekeeping and purity testing
The most reliable constituency in dem primaries in black women. And they overwhelmingly choose Biden. Those are the on the ground numbers state after state. So. No conspiracy here. Just democracy. Not perfect. But there it is.
Joe Biden said 150 million Americans died from guns and  120 million from COVID-19
if you don't understand why i plan to vote for biden: i'm just so terrified of of trump getting re-elected that i'm willing to do anything to prevent it. trump has taken away some of my rights as a queer trans person; this is personal for me
i will vote for biden because i can't take another 4 years of trump. he's already taken away some of the few rights i had as a queer/trans person. i want to prevent fascism from taking a stronger hold in the country; that may not be "change" but it is prevention

People will suffer regardless of who is in office. Biden is rejecting a true need for healthcare reform as people die or lose their homes due to the cost/69% support. Biden supports our wars overseas where the last admin he was in had a 90% civilian casualty rate. No moral ground
that makes no sense wtf. i'm voting for biden because i don't want the literal white supremacist in the white house. is that hard to understand?
BS. My wife and I are older folk and we support Trump. Most of our friends feel the same way, too. You wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to lie unless you were already worried Biden will lose the election.
Biden issues a mandate for everyone to wear masks outside!  What exactly is he in charge of to issue said mandate? #Trump2020
My state is a swing state, but even then I would encourage people who believe in their convictions to vote how they feel. I'm voting Biden but it's definitely the cowards way out for those who want real change, but I can only live my life and do best by the people I love.
Bit by the Biden Ants
Its 112 and higher next week in Arizona.  I will not wear my mask outside. Way to hot for that. Biden can get lost.

Sorry, you can‚Äôt convince me most Vets would prefer Marxism/Socilalism over voting for Trump. That‚Äôs BS. He has at least tried to change the terrible conditions at VA hospitals and how Veterans are treated. Remind me again what branch of service Biden and Harris served in?

Hey if Al Gore invented the internet, I'm sure Biden/Obama were in some part responsible for the US landing on the moon.
sure but i just dont see how this is an argument against voting for biden. like yeah a lot of things have lead to trump, but am i supposed to say "well guess i should go with the flow of history"?
They're probably gonna give it to Biden
So all that to say you are part of the 1% that voted for Joe Biden in his previous 2 attempts to run for president or the 2% that voted for Kamala Harris for President in the primaries? Which is it?

This is one of the many reasons I will be voting for Biden in November. We HAVE to keep moving forward, not backwards. Betsy wants to take leaps backwards.

If you were 50/50 between Biden and Trump and went 3rd party instead, it wouldn't be an issue because they both lost an equal shot at your vote.  It's not so much a vote for trump as a reduction in possible votes for Biden.  That being said, vote shaming is wrong, vote your heart
Any 12 year old joe Biden supporter needs to be yelled at sorry
You were never going to vote for trump, but you might have voted for Biden if he wasn't such a colossal tool. You voting third party or not voting represents the loss of a potential vote for King Douche but has no impact on trump, so it benefits him that you're not voting Biden.
I know I am!  Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Not enough time. By electing Biden it becomes a moot point.
How's that  house you're living in now for backing down and rolling over to let Joe Biden become the presumptive Democratic nominee
yeah that shit was awful. i hate that we have biden now instead of bernie. it sucks, but my biggest concern at the moment is whether trump gets elected, because frankly i can't tolerate another 4 years of this shit

Not voting is a vote for no one. It‚Äôs not a vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a vote for Biden. The way America has put all the blame of corrupt politicians on the working class is bizarre.
has been arguing with me about Biden and Harris and how I need to vote for them because at least it's a shuffle in the right direction.   A shuffle ain't big enough. I want a fuckin rocket.
You‚Äôve destroyed the country. Joe Biden is our only hope
Let‚Äôs not forget what Harris did to Kavanaugh. Whe WAS very nasty. Horrible horrible person. Does anyone think Biden is a racist?  Only Harris. #nasty
it really doesn't take much energy or time though. also never claimed voting for biden is "revolutionary", i claimed it's strategic to prevent a worse outcome
Please don‚Äôt trouble yourself to come on my account. I‚Äôm voting for Biden/Harris! #facts
Not hardly.  I'd sooner vote for a Pig than Biden.
I‚Äôd rather hear you then BIden and Blowie
I get it. We cannot allow someone with a disgusting track record on criminal justice like Biden/Harris into office. We must vote Trump to save our face.  #maga
Nope gotta see Trump smash Biden
By the way what message was Joe Biden sending when he put his hand above Kamala Harris‚Äôs rump Creepy Joe just can‚Äôt help himself or maybe there is a sinister message like ‚Äú I got your back African Americans‚Äù
The ouster of the incumbent is a beginning, no more, and if Biden's no more than an unimaginative repairman, we will need to press for more fundamental reforms across a broad front. The best Biden can do is to call for a national discussion of the issue.
Kamala Harris Brings Extreme Gun Control Position to Biden Ticket
If Trump willingly leaves office in January, a focus of the Biden/Harris administration should be a post card tax return. Many Americans will have confusing returns next year - at least make it less complicated for them.
Joe Biden picked up the endorsement of the Revolutionary Communist Party USA.
The difference between Biden and Trump. Biden sends Billions to Ukrain to save his own ass and lets his son profit millions. Trump sends his Son in law to broker a peace deal with Israel and the UAE and he gets it done. #TRUMPISMYPRESIDENT #MAGA2020
Fuck yeah she was! She was my first choice for president and the main reason I am excited to vote for Biden!  The  days are numbered.
Get used to this white people if you want to elect Joe Biden
No, I don‚Äôt believe he ran for POTUS, so was pointing out that Kamala obvs had more support than Pence did so Trumps ‚Äúargument‚Äù is silly (per usual). I agree that a Biden/Harris win would immediately start the healing process we desperately need. Love you too!
The difference between the two sides is that we don't expect gov't to make everything better. If you want to know the big appeal, it's what did Trump do to stay TF out of my way and let me make my life better. If you rely on Biden/Harris to make your life better, that's pathetic
There is a new facebook group called Latter day Saints for Joe. Biden is speaking to the group this Saturday
Putin thinks trump is his private pawn, we will show him he will not win and we will take care of yu Putin when Biden takes office. Big time sanctions against you for all the interference in our elections. Putin &amp; Trump, your days are numbered.

Why the surprise? Biden is just showing us how appropriate it would be to have him be POTUS.Politics won't confirm whose healthy and whose not to hide stories.  President Trump's brother had health issues as does Biden. Stop lying about people. Biden isn't America.  Nor is Kamala.
That is indeed laughable! Again, just like the "cages" were installed in the Obama-Biden administration, so too the removal of postal boxes also began in the Obama-Biden administration.
Its ok to have Kamala in office when she was continually knifing Biden in the back verbally b4 he chose her ?
CBS says Wall Street breathes "sigh of relief" at Harris pick. Well, Job Exporting Wall Street is the enemy of working people so expect Harris to be, too - no matter what phony claims are laid on to get elected. Harris and Biden are Corporate Shills from way back.
Biden is beginning Alzheimers candidate instead of president material.  You want Kamala Harris correcting his fuck ups ?
# Biden in the basement when Trump has been out paying people visits for his campaign.

Biden and Harris said that if your convicted of a hate crime you can not get a gun these two are idiots.
Biden and Harris said anyone convicted of a hate crime can not get a gun which is it either your coming to get our guns or not these two are idiots.

All I know is y are we sitting around like mushrooms. Y is it nobody can ask or open up Biden an Harris on they‚Äôre bullshit
1/ The Entire message of the Democratic Party is "Trump is bad." They offer NOTHING positive for America's struggling workers. Hillary did the same in 2016 and look what happened.  Nate Silver just gave Biden a 71% chance of winning and Trump, only 21%.
1/ Joe Biden is Not radical. He is a crooked corporatist and was right of center on most things, but not Good right. Bad Right as in wanting to cut Social Security and Medicaid.

Maybe a neuro-physiologist should explain to Brian how psychomotor activity and higher cognitive processes like decision making differ. Apparently he is totally unaware of how little they are related. Glad to see Biden getting cardio-vascular expercise tho. Good for body &amp; brian.

Why would anyone believe that? Looking back over his career, Biden could have done that but never did. This is just another empty, hollow, Dem promise not worth znyone's serious consideration. In a word, it's just more Dem MALARKEY.
I don't have room in my life for people who just can't accept who they are and think making a marked statement it about it will change them . Meghan Markle is one , Joe Biden is another.  A copycat politician who uses Donald Trump as an excuse to think he's better.

Ah, &amp; no mention of China working for Biden. How blind, how deaf. If foreign intervention is worth worrying about, then it's worth worrying about with respect to both candidates or neither, but showing partiality is not the solution.
Shove Joe Biden back where he belongs.  It's not in the White House either.  He's so stupid he copycats Donald Trump's campaigns.
Some professor tried to push Biden 101 on us at FAU in the mid 70's, or FAA-EWW  as it was known on the party circuit. We plied him with so much Jagermeister ,that he's now pen pals with Newt.

You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...

It was Obama who built the cages and put the children into them. Obama separated 38,000 ppl.  Trump provided schooling, medical needs, recreation and nutrition for them all.  NOT Biden/Obama.  Once again you lie.
Kamala totes alot of importance on science when discussing covid, but fails to recognize she and Biden have no chemistry.
I mandate Biden goes and  himself!
True, as far as we know Biden was never on Epstein's Lolita Express.
Yup. It should be obvious to one and all that a Biden Regime will be a rehash of Clinton/Obama/Hillary.  Don't know why this came to my head thinking of Bloomberg it's not even from my era. Money ain't for nothin' Lol
Makes $cents$ to me. Larry Summers has been advising Biden which means we would be soooooo EFFED.
She is a nasty, malicious, unethical hot mess. Proven during her days as prosecutor when she now did a 180 on everything she purported to believe just to be Biden's nominee. Dread to see her as President (Biden will turn the office over to her soon should he win). BUT Joe=loser.
Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.
Bloomberg to speak at Democratic convention   What role will Bloomberg have in a possible Biden regime?
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô  #FoxNews
STORIC PEACE AGREEMENT' BETWEEN ISRAEL, UAE     THIS IS REAL, TRUE SOUL OF OUR NATION! Despite the most vile &amp; malicious things hurled against him, Pres. Trump continues to amass huge accomplishments daily. This one is HUGE (and something Obama/Biden would never be able to do).

From Biden‚Äôs website, it‚Äôs also a donation when you purchase üôÇ
Sigh. Looks to me like the Biden accounts with 10 followers are much more prevalent
There are more Biden supporters at trump rallies protesting the great president then came out to hear a vegetable and a communist
If Biden debates President Trump, it will be done remotely. Off camera he will have people writing answers on boards or into teleprompter so he can read the answers.
TW: suicide  anyone who reads this thread and thinks that voting in a national election means nothing, i don‚Äôt get you. no way in hell you can convince me a HRC admin would have resulted in the same or that a Biden admin ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù absolutely fucking bleak.
OMG, terrible thought occurred to me. what am I gonna tweet about when Trump loses? What kind of rage-induced tweeting can I get outta Biden??
Was Biden's mangling of her name all about disrespect?  Huh?
Why is Biden allowed to lie on Twitter?  Apparently because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
She only got 3% of the primary votes and won't bring him Calif. as it's already Democrat. She is a strategically bad move for Biden with her ton of stinky baggage, but I'm delighted.  VOTE RED!
He doesn‚Äôt have to come out of his basement.  His campaign is predicated on trump being trump and basically voting himself out of office every time he opens his mouth!  Biden/Harris just sit back at laugh at the stupidity!!
Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate who was personnel friends with a Klu Klux Klan leader.
Fellow white folks, let‚Äôs talk about what Joe Biden did yesterday.   Think about it. A member of the old boys‚Äô club DELIBERATELY and VERY PUBLICLY used his position and his societal privilege to elevate a member of a marginalized population to a position she richly deserves.1/3
I just watched the Biden/Harris presser. It made me proud to be an American again. I haven't felt this way for over 3 and a half years now. As they said, it's about the soul of our country. Come on America, we can do this come November 3rd.
Mama Kamala and Uncle Joe too the rescue.                           BIDEN &amp; HARRIS WILL SAVE THE USA!!!!!!!!!!              So happy üòÅ
Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
He advised Biden not to extend an invitation to her! So it seems even Willie has had enough of her!!
And there is an even simpler reason: Biden would absolutely not have taken someone from a Senate seat who would be replaced by a GOP governor. Warren could have checked every box and he wouldn‚Äôt risk losing the seat.
Biden wanted the minority vote so bad... as a matter fact he‚Äôs even grown a bit entitled about it. But he previously announced that it was going to be a woman. Kamala is both black and Asian so... ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I remember Justin complaining OBAMA/BIDEN when they did the EXACT SAME THING....
Hiding &amp; working for Biden/Harris campaign
Anyone up for a survey? OFFICIAL: TRUMP-PENCE vs BIDEN-HARRIS  Pres Trump wants all responses sent to his office in 1 HR. Who will you vote for in November? Answer here:
What is so interesting is that Biden didn't need her to bring in California.  Not a wise strategic move, Joe, but then nothing you've ever done has been wise.

Biden picked VP running mate, not for her qualifications, just because she‚Äôs black

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!
Joe Biden has a weird obsession with little girls ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è trump is trump Kamala a coon ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we headed in a bad mf direction
In the 1920's Democrats were lynching, supporting KKK &amp; instituting Jim Crow. Learn your history! Republicans freed Democrats' slaves and fought for the Civil Rights laws against people like Thurmond, Byrd and yes - even Biden who opposed school integration and loved KKK Byrd.
Biden, lead us?! Ha. Your best joke yet.
Ever wonder who is running the PR campaign for the Lib looser's  Biden/Harris??? Just think, you could have had Bernie and ??? another Bernie.  Great choice Dems.
Trump/Pence win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Biden/Harris win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Either way humanity loses.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Biden has to have notes to make it through a friendly phone call.  Wow.  That's impressive.  He'll eat Putin's lunch for sure.
You know you ridin with Biden
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You will make a great team. I‚Äôm so proud to be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
I knew about her lackluster performance when she was in Cali but I choose to hope she‚Äôs become a better person since then. I‚Äôd still prefer her and Biden over Trump and Pence
You bet we do want Biden-Harris in the White House b/c Harris is not ultra liberal. But play your little tired games of ohhhhhhhhh that‚Äôs socialism. Socialism is giving $2T tax breaks to the 1% on the backs of the middle &amp; working class, Debbie.
You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.
Biden could‚Äôve picked Howdy Doodie &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt have lost my vote. Oh &amp; Black folk miss me with the argument about prosecutors, prosecuting crimes! When a criminal attacks your family you don‚Äôt see color.
I love how they paint Biden and now Harris as far left.
If I had a choice to vote for Trump, Biden or Putin I would gladly vote for my comrade Vlad.
I totally agree and understand why Kamala was picked for him.   Biden will not run for a second term IF he wins. This gives her a head start for 2024.  Most likely Joe will not finish his first term which is the only way she could ever be POTUS.
Trump: Some men insulted that Biden vowed to name female VP - ABC News -  via
So, who do you think KH will pick as her VP when Biden, if he wins, steps down for the good of the Nation? AOC?
Biden will be hearing Kamala's spike heeled foot steps in the shadows while he sleeps.
Team Biden is FkED! Trump 2020
Proud to support the Biden Harris ticket. Less than 90 days to get 45 out of the White House.
Will Michael Bloomberg be the Ambassador to Israel if Joe wins.   Biden won‚Äôt rule out naming donors as envoys, despite criticism  via
They saw record profits under Trump. Bankers are backing Biden anyway.  via
What Bull. Biden, the real racist, supported segregation, KKKByrd, and worse. He can't do or say a thing his handlers don't script for him. And you should have taken Willie's advice bc you will not help him win. You won't get near the WH.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden
Business as usual.  üîΩüîΩ  Wall Street executives are glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to be his VP running mate
Kamala Harris attacks Joe Biden on busing, race in Democratic debate
And this is who you all want as your vice president really LOL. Isn‚Äôt Biden bad enough
Can Bernie shame  his Berners into voting for a Biden/Kamala ticket?
Biden/Harris 2020 uh US Senate ü§£
Trump took the bait and called Kamala a ‚ÄúNasty Women‚Äù.    Where have we heard that before?    He consistently puts down stong Women.   Smart Women Against Trump (SWAT).  We the women of American are coming for you Agent Orange. #KamalaHarrisForVP #Biden   #TrumpIsLosing
I know y‚Äôall not gonna let trump win AGAIN. ü§° we know joe Biden and Kamala suck ass GET OVER YOURSELF
The Obama/Hillary mantra has always been to purge the left.   Even a Dem center left leaner should not vote for this center right Biden/Harris Republican ticket.
I refuse to be excited for someone with a troubling history intertwined with policing and the prison industrial complex. I'm voting for Biden but am less than thrilled with this choice.
A Biden/Kamala ticket proves Hedges is spot on again.
Im just glad Biden‚Äôs VP pick isnt also a million years old
Joe Biden is excited and ready time sniff!
In roughly 60 days, Arizonans will receive early ballots with the historic team of  and  at the top of the ticket. Biden Harris WILL win AZ,  the White House and WILL restore the soul of our nation. #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarris
Press conf in Wilmington tomorrow.  Just a stunner.  What's the over/under on how many days it takes Biden to get west of the Mississippi?
Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.
You Democrats are the most scurrilous, malicious group to come down the road in decades. And YOU will help Biden lose -- big.
Joe Biden Is Back At It Again, Just Chose Kamala Harris As His Running Mate. ü§î #BidenVP
I think it speaks volumes about the type of person Biden is to choose Harris. That he can forgive the primary debates.

At least he has them and takes numerous questions that aren't pre-approved from 'reporters' he's been told to call upon.  What's the journalistic value of Biden's TWO 'press conferences' other than comedy?
23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...
Joe Biden for President
JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT
Bullshit! Obama-Biden didn‚Äôt do shit for the American people.
My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.

The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.

VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."We'll see how that works out for them. They thought the same thing when Obama became president and look what a great job of helping the blacks out  he was. He was always pointing out black this black that just like Biden, they act as if blacks can't think for themselves.

So Biden's going to win, because everyone likes BJs? This poll can't be right, can it?
This is what Google says ! Bernie Sanders tweeted support for the pic. Don't buy the hype !
Still would be voting for Biden. I think Harris would be a great voice for the criminal justice reform. I'd prefer a President Booker and or a President Sanders. But I really don't want a 4 year term of Trump..
I love this pick. I‚Äôve been a Kamala fan for a long time. She will eviscerate Pence in a debate. She will be the fighter that Biden needs.  #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden is not thinking about anything.
Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.

I just did it, it defaults to  and is a fundraiser.  Biden is openly tied to BLM?  Too bad we don't have a MSM to talk about that.
Well so here we are, we have a Prez candidate that hides in the basement and cognitive powers are under suspicion.  He can't pronounce his running mate's first name. Biden says DJT is soft on terrorism, but his Admin gave Iran 1.5 Billion dollars. DJT took out Sulimani and ISIS.

I'd ultimately rather have Biden, but it's like picking between a Tankie and a Nazi; one is slightly worse than the other.

If you're in a swing state, then you should vote Biden. If you're in a firmly blue state, I'd argue that you should vote third party.
We'll go backwards either damn way, dude. Total stagnation isn't enough anymore, and if Biden doesn't push actually decent progressive policies during his presidency, then we'll prolly be left with a Cotton or Carlson presidency in 2024, both of which are worse than Orange Man.

And joe Biden has a brain injury. Lol
Kamala Harris relentlessly ripped into Joe Biden during the debates especially early on. I'm sure Trump will try to seize on that. Not saying it will be successful, just pointing it out.
apparently, Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, who is among other things a black woman as his running mate.  just get prepared for the takes you'd see on this from AA, from the fact that she is light skinned to the theory that Biden may be condescending.
Or, it shows just how far one party is willing to go to get the black vote, the vagina vote, and the "woke" white vote.   Most folks look at policies, performance, and results. Biden and Harris don't win that category ü§∑  #KAG2020

"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Yup, she would have been great for that as well, but she was my first choice for VP.   Unlike tRump though, Biden would never force her to do two jobs to show she is half-assed at both, when only part time at both!
Slow Joe Biden and Heels Up Harris.  Make no mistake, this is Harris running for President, Biden is in no shape to be Commander in Chief!

Why people are arguing about this is crazy to me. I would be very leery about picking a person who has never been elected and making them the next in line. Awful idea. But as a leftwing guy I can imagine she‚Äôd be less formidable in a primary in 2024 or 2028 depending on Biden.
I will be extremely upset if it‚Äôs Susan Rice. She has never held office nor run a political campaign. The person Joe Biden picks for VP will in all likelihood run for president in 2024. We need somebody who can do that and I don‚Äôt think Susan Rice qualifies
President told Obama and Biden that he knows everything they have attempted to do to him and he will bring them both down!
Gotta love it. So based on the latest coming out of who knows where, if Biden wins we can blame China! Seems some people will believe anything!

Glenn Beck is correct....China OWNS the bidens.  If biden is elected....china will own America. jobs lost......Freedom lost.
biden will give china anything they want......china will own America if biden is elected.  Trump does NOT let china get away with screwing America....Trump is tough on china. biden would give away our Freedom.

I think Biden winning the election could trigger Trump to start a coup, that's why I think Biden's the accelerationist candidate. I could be wrong, and wouldn't be sad if I was.  Other than that, Biden and Trump are both part of the problem. One's just more acerbic.
My conscience precludes voting for Trump. Biden is, at best, a slower burn leading to the same explosion. Third party is vainly waving a flag saying "fuck you" to an establishment that doesn't hear me.
Do you believe Biden choosing Harris actually helps him or hurts his chances of winning?
That‚Äôs kind of the thing: Biden may be the accelerationist vote. If he wins Trump may do everything possible, including seizing power to hold onto office. If Trump wins, no Trump coup, Trump has a harder time not standing down in 2028. This is pure rumination.

The Libs will be complaining about the protests but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna matter to the protestors. Biden/Harris aren‚Äôt going to have any more luck putting down protests than Trump did, and if they try to escalate the level of force that‚Äôll just end badly.

No it should be based on who is best qualified to assume the Presidency. Especially for Biden.
No, it won't be. Biden doesn't want someone strong who will challenge him when he does something questionable. He wants someone who will stand in the background smiling and looking pretty, not someone with ideas and opinions.

Just as Democratic Presidential candidate, Joe Biden made his big announcement of Kamala Harris as his Vice President-elect, VP Mike Pence was landing in Tucson.  AZ Dems claim the VP is distracting from President Trump's "reckless coronavirus response."
No, she called him a rapist.
I think now that Kamala is on the ticket Trump doesn‚Äôt make it to November. He was waiting to see if Biden would pick Whitmer thereby potentially weakening the black vote. Now he‚Äôll plan his exit strategy so he can get his pardon from Pence.
Does she still believe that  sexually assaulted and harassed women?

My take is he'll go with Rice. She's been part of the Obama-Biden team for a while know and her only flaw is Benghazi (not her fault). The Pod Bros (PSA) are already doing damage control for her. Add that Kamala was a cop and you can see it's rice.   Either one's a bad choice.

Ok we need to get out and vote we need to support the post office. We need a win #Biden/Harris2020
It does not matter who the president was in this pandemic. If you need to blame somebody you need to blame China. If Hillary Clinton was President there be two million people dead. Biden called him xenophobic for stop and travel from China. Remember that?

That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?

Well, everything we KNOW FOR SURE about Trump is worse than anything they can make up about Biden or Harris.

Because they know she can‚Äôt be president and if Biden wins and steps down, Pelosi becomes President. Heels Up Harris is an Anchor Baby.
If the chump has made it this long I personally don't believe there is any reason a person can't be president right now in this country. I am hoping we have learned and implement something to prevent this situation in the future. Joe Biden/Kamala Harris will guide us to health.

The Democrats should ask Biden to step down for his own good and the good of their party. Who should replace him? I guess  He got the 2nd most votes and he could stand toe to toe with Trump in a debate.  But Dems: Please spare Joe Biden any more humiliation. 8/8
Biden looks weak, sometimes even physically weak. I hate to see it. I'm serious.  The man that was vice president could have challenged Trump. The man stuck in his basement and struggling in interviews cannot.  He won't last four years. 4/8
There is obviously something wrong with Biden.  His mind just isn't where it used to be.  His memory and his cognition are failing.  He doesn't seem to be able to talk very long without a prompter either in front of, or behind, the camera. 3/8
But Biden picked a VP and it looks like the Democrats are going through with this. I wish they wouldn't. 2/8
I honestly thought Joe Biden wouldn't be the nominee, even after he won the primaries. I thought the Democrats would keep him from embarrassment and shame. I don't like seeing people humiliated. 1/8
Kamala, are you planning to defund the police, give tax payer funded abortions (you and Biden are hypocrites to your faith, raise taxes on the middle class, give more tax dollars to Iran like Obama and Biden.  How about trading terrorists for traitors like Bergdahl.

Biden chose a strong woman and that scares the bejesus out of Trump
When and if there is a presidential debate I am hoping to see it moderated on OANN. Forget fox news. There would be a good chance Donna Brazille would give the questions to Biden. Not that he could remember them.
Yes, we do. We went Biden early on &amp; never wavered. True #KHive also said we'd vote Biden regardless of VP. We are overjoyed it's our beloved #Queen , but support for Joe was never conditional.
Funny. New anti- ad playing in AZ saying how Biden is against opening schools right now. It‚Äôs supposed to make you mad but just made me happy. So your saying Biden doesn‚Äôt want people to die, and somehow that‚Äôs a bad thing? So much for Republicans being pro-life
Sigh. Looks to me like the Biden accounts with 10 followers are much more prevalent
Amazing how this imbecile is putting VP debates up on a pedestal since in the entire history of VP debates...No one gives a crap about VP's...until 2020 as Biden sleeps in the basement. How pathetic Bill Kristol's transformation has become.

Yes, criticize. Still not an excuse for not voting for Biden. I‚Äôm a huge AOC fan. I wanted Warren to be the candidate. But the Bernie supporters in 2016 who were sure as hell not supporting Hillary are a big reason we have Trump now.  Zero respect. Plenty of disdain.
About as much as Biden
I guess I can nitpick about the word ‚Äúupset.‚Äù  If anyone (leftist or not) chooses not to vote for Biden/Harris, they are implicitly stating their willingness to let Trump win. Anyone who considers that acceptable is, in my opinion, part of the problem.
Don‚Äôt take this as anything near an endorsement of Biden. I just take the converse as an indictment of my family. I can‚Äôt let my family die, and it would ruin the perspective of a lot of people if this movement allowed that, because it‚Äôs not just me.
You Still For Heels Up Harris and Racist Biden?

Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.

With Biden and Harris, you know what you‚Äôre getting. Ideas brought forth by Sanders, by Yang, by AOC are in the either. We will get there soon. However, it needs to be in steps.
In politics... you are NEVER going to get what you want. So stop bitching. It is a game of compromise. When you don‚Äôt get compromise, you get Trump, and a country in total disarray. Am I happy with Biden, no, but I know he is the correct direction. We can get back on track.
Biden is acting. just like out of the sopranos pretending to lose his mind to avoid prison
I'm not making a case not to vote for Biden, I'm making a case for him to actually adopt decent policies.
Trump, before your Dems made Covid happen but thats for another day, the economy was great, unemployment was at 50 yr.low among many things Trump did well. What have Dems done? Attack trump for 4 years. Class act. Lied about Russia, Quid quo Pro? And Biden gets away with it? 1/2
I hope, but I fear that Trump losing and a Biden presidency will somehow lead to Carlson or Cotton winning in 2024 using the same tactics trump's been using.

I'd ultimately rather have Biden, but it's like picking between a Tankie and a Nazi; one is slightly worse than the other.

Yesss But we have a right üò¢to our ‚ÄúRighteous Anger‚Äù I‚Äôm upset b/c of the lies and political theater ü§®. Don‚Äôt play us!!! I feel Biden played Warren and wasted our time!!When you play Warren you play us!!
Interesting perspective  Why Kamala Harris VP pick could cost Biden the election  #FoxBusiness
PHOTO: Joe Biden Needed A Script to Understand Why His Handlers Chose Kamala Harris
I find it interesting that Biden, who supported segregation, picked a running mate related to a slave owner of Irish slaves.
That's a very uneducated take. For one there's a video of Yang saying "I don't get a fuck about a spot in the Joe Biden administration." And Yang has publicly stated he would run against Biden in 2024 either as a Dem or independent.
Either Kamala lied about believing Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers &amp; used those women for a political jab or she did believe them &amp; decided to ignore them to be try and become Vice President.   Neither one of these actions demonstrate the morality Democrats claim to have the high ground on.
Biden/Harris  =  HAND ON, HEELS UP
Shaun King tweets 99% chance he'll never vote for Biden or Kamala, 2 years later he gushes profusely  via
Dear Mr. President a coronavirus vaccine my Election Day still won‚Äôt get you my vote.  Biden/Harris 2020!
Harris was the safest VP choice for Biden to make.
Totally "made up" üëçüëç
Joe Biden, who‚Äôs that guy
I was upset by the letters from Black professionals also. What happened?? Was Biden going to choose Warren or Whitmer?&amp; the Black Community found out?? I‚Äôm sure Corporate America weighed in on Warren and Biden caved once again ‚ÄºÔ∏è
I want you to know üßêEvery Black person is not excited about this pick. Warren is my champion and I‚Äôm upset b/c I feel Biden played Warren. Biden knew Kamala for yrs, and she worked with Biden‚Äôs favorite deceased son. Biden knew who he was picking. Political Theater.
Are you sure, With the support of many moderate republicans that are going to vote for biden in a way to kick out trump of the white house.
Sun City West, Arizona in what was once the bastion of Republicans has loads of Biden signs everywhere. It is quite a warm feeling to behold and hoping my state is responsible for overturning the tables at The White House.
That's all fine and dandy, but which of Biden's policies do you prefer over Trump's?
LMAO. The dumbest thing I saw on the internet this year. Who is afraid of Biden? Besides little girls and former staffers. Oh but I forgot MeToo and Trust all women not for libtards.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Is this the face she makes when she locks up black men then suppresses evidence that would free them? Perfect VP for a crook rapist like Biden. Oh yeah me too and trust all women not vs. Libtards

All Black people are not excited about this pic. Warren is my champion and Biden played her. Biden knew Kamala b/c she worked closely and was friends with Biden‚Äôs favorite son who passed from brain cancer. I say he made his decision a long time ago. Political theater..
harris wasnt picked because she is best for America, she was picked because she IS NOT WHITE.  democrats further divide America in racial issues.  kamala bashed biden for being a sexual predator.....now she is ok with him being a sexual predator...NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA
Biden/Harris!!!! Let‚Äôs go
Fuck  who in 2020 thinks it‚Äôs the duty of the peasant to blindly please the king - it‚Äôs not. Joe Biden isn‚Äôt entitled to shit. He needs to earn our votes and between choosing a cop as VP and doubling down on no #M4A, he‚Äôs actively pushing away voters.
Biden didn‚Äôt pick a black woman for me ?ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm disappointed üòî Warren is my Champion and I feel Biden played her during the veepstakes. Biden is full of Shitttt!! I didn‚Äôt vote for President Obama b/c he was Black!!!
It is Historic, No Doubt, but Harris called Biden a racist and now she is on the ticket?!?! Harris is not a moderate and is a bad pick!!!!

It was predictably grotesque. AZ Central: Biden proves Ducey has gone 'noseblind' to Trump
Bass would've been a very bad choice.  I dont beleive Biden seriously considered.  rather I beleive that certain elements wanted her.  out of respect Dodd faux championed her.  cant imaging that would've been choice ...
I understand it's historic but I was turned off by the letters demanding Biden choose a Black Woman. Come on ü§®. Was he going to choose Whitmer or Warren?? I‚Äôm going to vote for the ticket but don‚Äôt ask me to do Shitttt else. I didn‚Äôt vote for President Obama bc colorüò§

If Biden manages to win, and we take the senate and keep the house, I would like Nancy retired for this dereliction of duty.
Biden lost my vote for his role in getting us into Iraq war.  He double lost it for not being smart enough to push for Medicare for all in pandemic

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
Biden/Harris supporters are stupid
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
And still no Biden signs...
Biden wants to know who Snowden is... Lol......
Drew is right! Beijing Biden ran for President in 1988 and again 2008. That‚Äôs where he got his nickname 1% Joe. He never got more than 1% of the votes either time. 2% Harris is with him now.
It‚Äôs funny how dems don‚Äôt see the polls running parallel to what the were in 2016. Polls that they were running claiming that Hillary was winning everywhere, when in fact she was losing badly everywhere. Biden is running the same as Hillary was back then. üëçüèª TRUMP WINS BIGLY!
Beijing Biden has made it clear he will mandate illegal aliens are covered in his healthcare mandate. Couple that with open borders and joy wood is right!
You mean Biden? Cuz Biden is a predator...
People, Biden has nothing to say.  Harris and her public record along with failed presidential run speaks for itself.  Dangerous duo that will appeal to uninformed lemmings and illegal migrants.
You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.

So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument

This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.
- have you looked into this? Biden seriously looks like he is exhibiting tardive dyskinesia. A friend with 40 years nursing experience taking care of elderly totally agrees.
The virus was paid for by Democrats with a promise to remove TRUMP from office at all costs and get back to bowing to RED CHINA. Biden will do that. TRUMP will make their existence miserable. BUT we need the HOUSE &amp; SENATE RED to make having TRUMP even stronger for AMERICA

Biden doesn't count; he has dementia. His conservative handlers will be running the show, just like Trump (also has dementia) Even though his wife stopped speaking for him, we know the real score, unless we're too cult driven. #indoctrinated

I know you despise Trump. But, why would you care about the Dem convention? The DNC shafted their voters two pres. primaries in a row. They handed it 2 Hillary in 16. Now after Biden supposedly won the nom, they're going to slide Kamala in after the inauguration.
If you vote for Biden your taxes will go up the Democrats have already promised that.  How do you think they are going to pay for all the free stuff they are going to give away?  The stock market will crash to Obama levels or lower.

U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
To all the libs excoriating leftists for not wanting to vote for Biden: you idiots, how could anyone ever get it so wrong. üòâ
Haha. You're just spewing right wing talking points. A front for progressive agenda? That's just a way to paint Biden as a radical when it's really hard. You have to find a way to do this. So you say he's a Trojan horse. It's a tactic because a moderate would snatch Republicans
Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.
Have you ever scrolled through replies to Biden tweets? Some of the dumbest, most brainwashed people on the internet are super stoked for a mentally deficient old rich white pedo and a communist hag to restore honor and end corruption. Dear God, #TheGreatAwaking is coming.

I guarantee Trump will NEVER go to prison.  He will resign &amp; Pence will pardon him. HELL, Biden would pardon him in a minute!! NONE of these politicians want to open that Pandora's box. THEY ALL BELONG BEHIND bars, but there are two justice systems in the US. Ours and their.

Biden can't/won't have a rally,  this mask wearing is his subliminal rally.
Strange who Trump likes to claim isn‚Äôt a real American. Barrack Obama, Michelle Obama, and now Kamala Harris. No question if Biden was born in the US though? Hmm, I wonder why. I can‚Äôt qwhite put my finger on it.

Have you heard Trump speak lately? Biden has a speech impediment that he's been dealing with his whole life. What's TRUMP'S excuse?
You do this and split the vote from Biden so Trump can win then you gonna have a lot of bad energy being directed at you. Another 4 years of unchecked racism from Trump because of Kanye, you gonna leave that kind of legacy for your kids?
Lol. This is the 3rd time Biden has ran for President.  He got his nickname 1% joe because he only got 1% of the vote the last time he ran for President. Harris only got 2% of the Democrat vote when she just ran for president. You‚Äôre welcome!

Very interesting approach.  However. Trump specifically says that if we vote for him he will solve the crime. Also Trump has said and ran television ads stating Biden's America will lead to more gun murders and violence in states. So which is it? You can't have both.

Agreed! Trump is far from perfect, but he's done so much good for this country too.  A vote for Biden / Harris is to cut off your nose to spite your face. Do you hate Trump enough to vote for the destruction of America?
Joe Biden is gonna win. Trump will lose by a landslide.

Dude, you posted the same article twice. I‚Äôve responded with memes showing my support for Biden because this is getting boring and you‚Äôre just flooding the field with BS. Now you want to segue to Obama? Who are you trying to impress?
And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.

Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.

You‚Äôre missing the point like you demolition rats did in 2016. Send us video of 20 people let alone 2000 people gathering anywhere in this country today to support 1% Beijing Biden and 2% Harris. We will wait................./
This is insane!  Biden has a lot of questions to answer!  Hunter, Tara Reid and others.
Biden Did Nothing.
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
I hear what ur saying and I definitely understand your anger. And if you don‚Äôt want to vote Biden then by all means don‚Äôt. But I know people who got healthcare thanks to the Medicaid expansion and that was the aca so if even one person gets healthcare cuz of Biden it‚Äôs worth it.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.
We know Biden can‚Äôt complete a sentence and Kamala just doesn‚Äôt make sense with her crazy rhetoric that only benefits rich politicians living in mansions somewhere
Biden wants to kill jobs and raise taxes. He‚Äôs not hiding it.

I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
So Biden is racist? Lol. Nice argument

This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
We can't stop good trouble.  It's needed more then ever now. The line has been delineated between good and evil.  Biden and trump.
Biden does that already
LOL! Do you mean votes that biden/harris never had? Ridiculous.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
Trump is running for president, too, sweetheart. Biden has never been accused of anything besides being an affectionate uncle.   You're in a cult. Cults are for the weak minded.   You are no longer worth my time.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!
Everyone know Biden &amp; Harris are incompetents. This shows your true colors.

Taylor swift sings songs about all the wrong choices she has made in choosing men in her life..be ready for a hit (don‚Äôt know how you can listen to a thirty year old who sounds like a 8 year old with no talent),about sleepy joe Biden! Another bad choice Taylor! No taste in men!!
She is the reason Kamala is the VP choice. If Biden wins he will step as side or be removed and Clinton will be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù as the vp for harris. You and every other democrat will be the reason too. Maybe that blows wind up your ass idk but Trump won bc Hillary sucks realize that
They are going on all over. Maybe there is no parade yet for Biden/Harris because BLMO and AntiFa haven't stolen enough boats?
Taylor sings about what wrong choices she has made in men. Biden will be next on her shit list!!!
And by the way, NOT accused doesn't mean Biden did it, but boy do you people love to spread that shit around about him, don't you? Hypocrite much?
Only one candidate is accused of raping a child. Spoiler alert: it's not Biden. Don't pretend you care about sexual assault, or men who walk in on naked teenagers brag about it to Howard Stern (easy to find interview), because you clearly don't. Which troll farm do you work at?
After doing that, suppose you are forced to choose who would have sole responsibility to take care of a newborn baby for 24 hours, Biden or Trump (neither one is allowed any assistance, including from their running mates).
A little thought experiment.  Watch this (short) clip of Biden  and then watch any clip of Trump speaking recently (even where he is facing combative and hostile reporters, which is of course nearly all the time).
If U wanted to move the country more to the left why the FUCK did you nominate Biden???? Why the FUCK are you letting HRC, Bloomberg and fucking Kasich speak at the conv? It's laughable you think we are "in your way" it's the fucking  preventing the country from moving left!
What America needs now is a reporter with Jim Acosta's energy to ask Joe Biden some questions after he speaks.

Biden and Harris will get it done. Till then more are going to die.

Based on decades of calculated &amp; self-aggrandizing opportunism between Biden &amp; Harris, it is easy to deduce that both have replaced a typical moral worldview with a religious adherence to an amoral, hedonistic, and ever subjective leftist doctrine. Disconcerting to say the least.

And, I love Joe's ads that indicate he ran the successful recovery act. Remember the Obama-Biden recovery? Those who could find jobs, usually had to take on 2 to 3 part time jobs just to survive. NOW that's a recovery?

Good God...the only thing Biden has going for him is bloviating political rhetoric...
You want Russia to rip us off Biden will beat you like a drum and your ego will really be deflated &amp; you are trying to rig the election w/ no funding usps
I think Biden would be a perfect fit.
I was hoping &amp; praying that Joe Biden would choose you, for his running mate.  We need to STOP Trump, from harming America anymore than he already has!!!!!  Thank you, for being you!!!!!!!  You are a real asset to America and to the Vice President.

trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
New York State‚Äôs Attorney General Letitia James Will Deliver Justice. Inmate Donald Trump, January 20, 2020!!!   President Joe Biden November 3, 2020.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.

Speaking of Hunter....WHAT ever happened to the whole Ukrainian Biden story? It just disappeared.
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
‚Äú‚Å¶ is the diet cola, the light beer of presidential candidates.‚Äù  ‚Å¶  #TWGRPS
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...

Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
Let me walk through what happens if/when Biden wins; more lethal austerity for working people, more fracking, more police violence against protesters, probably another coup in Venezuela/Bolivia, definitely TPP, liberals go back to brunch and not thinking about politics.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.

So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶

The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?

He is right, if Biden wins, the economy falls into a depression.

Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Nope! We're well past that point! If Biden's POTUS, the fascist police will cont to beat &amp; kill ppl w impunity but the diff will be them wearing pink unis in support promoting women's rights.
Your beliefs sway wherever you think the votes are. you have a history of publicly denouncing Biden saying that he‚Äôs a racist that he is a sex offender and now you‚Äôre his running mate? you laugh about your marijuana use but imprison 1500 marijuana users not dealers?
Don‚Äôt forget to return the ones you‚Äôve already removed! And tell Trump ‚Äúcheaters don‚Äôt win‚Äù, at least the 2nd time around.  Biden-Harris!!!!!

He promised he‚Äôd never cut SS or Medicare and he hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure where you got that idea. Biden wants socialized medicine and open borders, which means an open stream of illegal aliens who want health insurance. That is unsustainable and ridiculous. Why should we pay for it?
Biden won‚Äôt abolish ICE.

It sad to think we live in such a world that people would do this without remorse while the rest of world allows it.   It is also quite annoying that Americans can be more wrapped up in Biden vs Trump than care about about how we are giving billions to that evil government.

Uniting the Dem Party &amp; inspiring young progressives who are deeply skeptical of Joe Biden &amp; Dem establishment is critical *to defeating Trump*. Giving AOC 60 seconds is a slap in the face that undermines that effort. Giving her a prime spot to make the case will help it greatly.

Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
That‚Äôs right: ‚Äúa vote for Biden, we must keep on hidin; vote for Trump, we‚Äôll get over the hump!‚Äù

Amazing to me that the DNC is still pandering to moderate Conservatives, who will never vote Democrat, as though Biden somehow has more clout and insider connections than Hillary fucking Clinton.
If we had a real media in this country they would be as outraged over the fact that Joe Biden has consistently refused to answer questions as they are about people mispronouncing Kamala Harris‚Äô name.
And still no Biden signs...
Joe Biden has dementia, anyone would have a brain can see that.  They are using Joe Biden to get anyone from the Democratic party on the ticket to get in the White House. They are using an elderly man and it is cruel.
I want to see Trump and Biden debate before any votes are taken.  I took care of my grandmother who had Alzheimer's, and my father who had dementia.  Joe Biden is showing signs of both of those.  I think that it is cruel that the DNC is putting him out there. It's elderly abuse!
My go-to is to minimize possible harm in the short term, so my instinct is to vote for Biden. But I‚Äôve heard convincing, coherent arguments for either path.
Weighing all the minutiae that generate from taking either risk presents a plethora of questions like that. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still undecided, and don‚Äôt see transparent moral or logical failings in either leftists voting for Biden or leftists abstaining.

I just see Trump roast Biden over every single thing. But never mentions the fact that Biden let's kids rub his leg hair and sniffs them like a freaky sex predator. Kinda seems to me, Trump doesn't wanna go there.
This makes zero sense. You‚Äôre describing something occurring in Trump‚Äôs USA, not Biden‚Äôs.   If anything Biden‚Äôs election would cause riots in Republican strongholds but I‚Äôm guessing this might be a little too complex for you.
Oh boy....popping up to support the wrong side...I'll pour you a glass of wine and we can discuss what's wrong with the Biden/Harris ticket.
One easy way to see that enthusiasm doesn't equate to votes is to look at Democratic primaries. Bernie Sanders definitely had more enthusiasm. He had much larger crowds than Biden. But Biden still won. Enthusiasm doesn't mean you are going to win.
Clinton won by ~+14, so this looks consistent with the Biden +7-8 national that we keep seeing
Facts matter, truth Is truth no subjectivity here. Biden made himself clear so did Harris.
But I don't think it matters. I think Biden will get the votes from people that are un enthusiastic about him. Trump has Trumpist cult members who are going to be the most enthusiastic supporters. I concede That's 30% of America. But that won't win the election
Not if the person supports Trump. Or isn‚Äôt voting for Biden. Apart from that, I‚Äôm very open minded!

Why does he need to?? Trump is self-destructive. Biden should continue to connect with the voters, as he has done, until the debate. AFTER the debate, the campaign should start doing weekly pressers with either #Biden or #Harris. #BidenHarris #November3rd #NovemberIsComing
Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign hats are made in America, while MAGA hats are outsourced to China.
I didn‚Äôt.  So I‚Äôm taking a leap here but I‚Äôm guessing‚Äúbig news about ONE guy we already knew about‚Äù then leftist ‚Äúlawlessness and hate‚Äù a brief Hillary Clinton segment then Biden (joe and hunter) It‚Äôs the same show nightly (just a jumbled up running order)
trump is the best option right now tbh. he‚Äôs on a roll with the new peace treaty w israel and that‚Äôs a huge deal. biden is too corrupt to take control and would plummet this country to the ground. that‚Äôs my opinion though...
You are spewing a series of disproven headlines.  Biden / Harris will Mark the end of the Republic... their loyalties are not with the American people.  I cannot accept that.
This is exactly why people who say Trump and Biden are the same are completely wrong.
Trent Lott had to resign for bragging that he supported Strom Thurmond. Biden befriended Thurmond and is the nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Let that sink in.
Yes. The ones that baffle me are "Republicans for Biden"? If you vote for Biden and the progressive left agenda you really aren't a Republican.ü§î
Joe Biden¬†said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to "defund the police" in the¬†wake of the protests¬†across the country.
This  defunding bullshit is surreal, as it is.  But then, coming this fall: The DOJ (i.e. Bill Barr) releases some bullshit about Biden in attempt to delegitimize Biden as a candidate.  It will be framed so any denial by Biden or Dems will only appear suspect.  That's a coup
That should disqualify Biden completely for consideration but instead he is the Democratic candidate.  Insane.
Trump has not violated the constitution- he is systematically returning control back to the people, rather than the corrupt career politicians.   Example - how can You not objectively have an issue with what Biden and his son did/are doing to Ukraine?
Biden said he would sign it if it comes with a solid funding plan.   He is just not campaigning on it.   To win a general, can't be too specific. There are groups that like their current coverage. Kaiser, Culinary Workers, Tricare...
She was caught by the Biden suprise.
Biden isn‚Äôt currently in government. Trump is the head of the executive branch.   See the difference?   He doesn‚Äôt owe the country‚Äôs assignment editors crap.
I‚Äôm not joking, if you don‚Äôt plan on voting for Biden, unfollow me. I‚Äôm not dealing with this shit, you either want Trump to win, or you deal with the lesser of two evils. And if you choose Trump winning, I don‚Äôt want you in my life. At all. Leave.
What is this guy talking about what are they going to arrest Biden and Harris for this is getting crazy
But does Biden have the stamina to do the job?
No we kn6, it will be Joe Biden üíãüíãüíãüíãüíãüíã
She only knows what Biden is told to say.
And here is Biden's "Navy":
Alot of people prefer Joe Biden.
Well maybe she is the Biden whisperer.
Additionally there is no proof either way that Biden or Trump buys only American goods. Trump is bringing manufacturing back to the US, while Biden during his 40 plus years did nothing to stop it from moving out of our country.
Trump made comments beginning in April alleging vast fraud in vote-by-mail and that USPS ineptness contributed to it. Biden picked up on it. Not baseless then, and not baseless now.
And here is Biden's boat parade!
Biden‚Äôs only chance of winning
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
The most fundamental difference between Trump &amp; Biden?  When Trump‚Äôs interests conflict with the nation‚Äôs interests, he serves himself above all else. He will gladly see every institution, every intelligence agency burn to the ground if he could win.
"If she weren't my daughter, I would date her."  Biden didn't say that about his daughter.  That was Trump.  Biden's never paid hush money to a call girl.  That was Trump.  Biden doesn't have over 20 women accusing him of sexual assault.  That's Trump.
üóë 1 headline and 2 lies.  1) Trump didn‚Äôt make up a birther lie about Kamala, he has only responded to a baiting ‚Äúreporter‚Äù who brought up a written false story about Kamala.   2) There are zero racist themes in Trumps campaign. However, you can find racist themes with Biden.
No shit!!! I‚Äôll have room in my car and gas in the tank.
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
So I was thinking that Biden/Harris needs to shift there messaging to more about a ‚Äúbetter day‚Äù is on the horizon!   According to this article that type of positive messaging will be more effective with the 40% of eligible voters who are non-partisans ‚Å¶
I thought you hashtagged "settle for Biden"...
Biden hasn‚Äôt spewed out thousands upon thousands of flagrant lies like Donald and hasn‚Äôt called the free press the enemy of the people. And he wonders why the free press treats him differently?
The left is going to revolt when they find out the current condition of Joe Biden. The nomination was given to him by the DNC. There's a reason he's in the basement &amp; cannot take reporter's softball questions. He's unable to do that but the left thinks he's ready for Trump?
KH is at 90% approval with Dems. Higher than Biden. Log off here once in a while.

Well to be honest,  they dont like to let Biden speak anymore eitherü§£ü§£ü§£
Well it's not Biden. Sadly you've been lied to &amp; you're going to be very disappointed. Media will try to drag Biden across the finish line, but they can only go so far. It stops on Sept 26. Theres a reason Biden doesnt take questions, he cant. He has deteriorated &amp; it has been...

Meanwhile Joe Biden runs from all questions from the press.
Obviously this is all theoretical.  What a Biden win will do though is show these fuckups enough proof that they can continue to get voted in without doing anything for the American people.
This current "Trump wont leave when biden beats him" narrative is just another in the long line of what ifs designed to modify the election.  Its a lot like the toilet paper manufacturers saying are you prepared for a long lock down...

I dont support everything he says. Esp. always taking credit for stock mkt. I think a huge mistake. I wasnt aware of mistakes made by Obama/Biden during H1N1. It's prob unfair to blame them. Just like unfair to blame Trump. The entire world has suffered from this you cant blame
Wow...you are the reason so many people vote third party.  You are attacking other liberals, this doesn‚Äôt help your cause.  If Biden loses, you‚Äôll blame the same liberals that you viciously and proudly attack,  great job in helping elect Trump.  You must be proud
the biggest obstacle Kamala faces is being a female leader.  at some point chopping down is nauseating.  shes got a job to do for 100 pct.  just like Biden.  at the highest level folks need to be judged on that plane.  I foremost would like a good VP and President.
Mark Twain once said you should never trust a man who has only one way to spell a word. But as is always true, actions speak louder than words. In Trump's case he acts, Biden did nothing but, plagiarize. bluster, self aggrandize and lie, for over 40 years.

Oak Park? I would think there are a buttload of Biden supporters there.
It's funny that Biden only comments after the meeting about c-19 was wear a mask.
I would actually flip that perspective.  We got Trump as a reaction to the neglect of the working class throughout the country.  I think a Biden presidency, run on ‚Äúnothing will fundamentally change,‚Äù will set the stage for an open racist like Tom cotton.
Biden the can't do man. Perfect candidate for the democrats, they are all about the can't unless it fills thier coffers, protects their agenda of evil, or furthers thier ineptitude.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden and hoping that some stronger willed person than me burns the whole restaurant to the ground. Because this place pads the bill, poisons the food, and then beats/murders you for complaining.

Lol scared of Biden? Thats just funny
You're def. not a lawyer. "Did not reveal" not "Does not have". Surely you know what happened. It's going deeper than this. The reality is it goes all the way to Comey. What is not known yet is will Comey fall on the sword to protect Obama &amp; Biden. I don't think hes man enough
This is backfiring in a huge way.   All 4 of my neighbors who are Trumpers took down their Trump signs &amp; are now going to vote for Biden.
I don‚Äôt like Biden or Harris, but this kind of stuff is unnecessary. (Funny,but unnecessary). I don‚Äôt like the Trump-trash crap either.
I like Schiff but I think this guy would be a perfect AG under Biden.   Much more aggressive and a rising political star !
To all the old heads that keep getting mad at me about my comments on Biden/Harris. I list her 4 bills she passed and ask them again what has she done to gain your support.

Very good point!! Biden wants to raise tax‚Äôs, give amnesty to 11 million illegal persons, give them free Medicare, free school free free free for anyone but an America!! We worked all our lives to get Medicare etc. it‚Äôs just not right or fair!. Biden‚Äôs in capable to hold office!!
Hmm, that's a little too much.   If I agree to be Deep State Hype Man for free, can I at least get in on a small amount of grifting?
I got dibs on Archduke of Tomfoolery
Yeah, I am bracing myself for the worst. I feel absolutely no sense of certainty that Biden will win and everything will be OK again. Our country crossed a lot of lines and keeps crossing bigger lines, who knows how far things will escalate?
I said it 4 years ago and I'llsay it again, Trump was elected due to the  'anyone but Hillary' vote. This time around, same thing is happening, only with Biden. Its like they forgot that there are more than 2 people running. We have other options. #DoYourResearch

However, one could certainly say that Joe Biden should not tout his Catholic ‚Äúfaith‚Äù when he has been spiritually separated from the Church‚Äîsince such formal heresy deprives one of the supernatural virtue of faith.
Don‚Äôt forget to return the ones you‚Äôve already removed! And tell Trump ‚Äúcheaters don‚Äôt win‚Äù, at least the 2nd time around.  Biden-Harris!!!!!
If you're willing to settle for Biden why not settle for me? üòò
Just wondering who she had to sleep with to get that nomination.  Last week, biden says' Next week I will find out who my running mate is....and it's like OOPs...and he just keeps on making his gaffes.
I would say abolish ICE, but Trump uses it as a private army and Biden helped create it, so what‚Äôs the point.

Do you understand how elections work in this country? You‚Äôre aware that Biden won the primaries in a landslide, correct? He received twice as many votes as the guy in 2nd place. Again, please, your inane whining makes no difference. It‚Äôs 2020 and I have your back and so do Dems.
Kamala Harris is going to destroy this clown in the debates. She damn near made Biden cry and he 20xs tougher than Pence.
Voting for Biden/Harris is the least I'm gonna do.  The work never stops after Nov. 3rd.
These guys and their now radical party are complete jokes, Harris dropped from the race quickly and now VP?  Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
My FB friends seem to understand that electing Biden doesn't fix anything (other than the issue of Trump of course) and know we will have to keep up the pressure, even increase it, IF he is elected...but seeing far too many who think he is the solution.
Historian says Biden will beat Trump in November ‚Äî and he‚Äôs been right since 1984 | Opinion  via
Really not optimistic about things because I've been seeing comments like "Well, when Biden wins in November at least all the BLM protesters can finally go home." (roughly a quote and should have screencapped it)..and basically just talk about how electing Biden will fix things..
I don‚Äôt see a non-pathetic reason to vote for Biden/Harris. Lmao
Hey   ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got some explaining to do‚Äù   ... #metoo #Biden #Kamala #KamalaHarris #republican #democrat  #QuestionOfTheDay #sellout
You‚Äôre not just voting for President. Consider everything else at stake, suck it up, and vote Biden. You can be true to yourself AFTER 45 is gone. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing
The left never forgives us for our past actions. So here? "My gut reaction," Joe Biden reportedly declared in 1973, "is that they [homosexuals] are security risks [in the federal govt], but I must admit I haven't given this much thought‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be darned!‚Äô‚Äù
On the other hand, if they DO think Biden is middle-class, we‚Äôve officially solved the question of why conservatives think middle-class families should be fine financially.
Trump ad on TV: ‚ÄúJoe Biden says, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre gonna pay more in taxes.‚Äô That means more taxes for the middle class...‚Äù Do... do Republicans think Joe Biden is middle class? (Also, lol that Republicans ‚Äî let alone Trump ‚Äî care about the middle class.)
Not any blue will do  even Biden's VP has done so much damage to so many communities. But yeah, sure back up what you say not what you do, right????
Clearly, one can be both gay and an idiot voting against his interests. Every vote not tallied for Biden is a vote for Trump and Mike Pence. If you can‚Äôt see the difference between those men I can‚Äôt help you.
Obama-Biden administration was anti-Israel and pro-Arab Muslim from get-go. O treated Netanyahu w/ huge disrespect &amp; you were NO help w/ anything. Taking credit for this is exactly like your constant lying and plagiarizing of anyone with a good idea. You are a disgrace.
Biden should appoint Warren "Empress of Fixing Shit."

So why on earth would you back up &amp; endorse Joseph Biden???
Arizona‚Äôs superintendent of public instruction Kathy Hoffman formally endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, arguing their administration would better serve Arizona public schools.
Hilarious anti Biden ad: "11 million illegal aliens competing for American jobs" and the video is farm workers. Oh so many Americans are horrified that they can't get a job working in the fields. LOL the incompetence of  and his minions. Can't even racist right.
Seriously, stop trying to sell us on how great Biden and Harris are...stop making childish threats...stop berating anyone who isn't praising the Dem ticket and instead realize there are major concerns and it will likely take protests, strikes, etc to get the progress we NEED.
And once again, if you are a "blue no matter who" type liberal, you could help your own cause by actually admitting that our choices are shitty, and pledging your support and participation in direct action even IF Biden wins in November. Too many seem to think he is the solution.
Wait a tic. I hate Kanye as much as the next person but doesn‚Äôt this mean that he ISN‚ÄôT playing Biden spoiler since he is now running against Trump?
Vote for Biden.  Seriously, tRUmp will only get much worse if he is left in office.
So, Biden is no longer "Sleepy Joe" but is now "Slow Joe".  What is most interesting and will remain with you throughout history...FOREVER...is the fact that you are Impeached Trump.
i wonder if joe biden is going to campaign in the whatthefuckican and whatthefuckicratic counties of ohio
3) ironically tankies declaring Biden ‚Äúthe Maoist‚Äôs choice‚Äù does far more to validate Trump‚Äôs attacks than anyone bring up Tara Reid every could, straight up Trump‚Äôs strategy this time around is literally just tie Biden/Harris to tankies &amp; antifa
Can you explain why our initial purpose was to #FlattenTheCurve? I think we're in week 25? And fuck you if you're doing this  bc it helps Joe Biden get elected.
I am sure these characters are going to circle file Republican votes!
If this is what real leadership looks like then real leadership is dead. Biden looks like he's dead and no one told him.
Well, this is interesting and receiving no coverage outside of FNC.  Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews
It was the topic of convo at Karen's Brunch Bunch today. It was unanimous: voting for Biden is a 'no brainer'.  The topic quickly turned to a heated discussion about which day will be more glorious: When Queen 'K' destroys Pence in  a debate or when the election is finally over.
Not for nothing, but if Mitt really wanted to rock the boat he‚Äôd switch party affiliations. His values line up more with Biden anyway.
Biden is counting on Republicans who don‚Äôt like trump. I‚Äôm pretty sure that he would rather alienate us than them.
Donald Trump actually believes the American people will actually allow and accept him stealing the election from Joe Biden and the American people. It won‚Äôt happen. It will be total civil disobedience and unrest everyday of his presidency. The bird brain has to be voted out of
On a scale from 1 to glue fiend... how deeply will Biden sniff?
In other words you can‚Äôt name a single Biden policy. If I was in your shoes I would have at least googled his platform and cut and paste something in the hope of changing someone‚Äôs mind. But of course when Sanders was running I and all of his supporters could recite his platform.
I‚Äôm 20 year old daughter who was a Bernie supporter and volunteer has informed me she will either be voting 3rd party or not at all. She doesn‚Äôt like Trump, but she doesn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris any betterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Use common sense vote  Biden to stay alive.‚Äù And come back from the brink of death destruction authoritarianism darkness corruption criminality predator pedophile behavior
Joe Biden could walk on stage at a debate, drunk as fuck, slurring his words in a track suit and sandals promising to raise my taxes and I would STILL, without doubt, in a heartbeat, wait outside 8 hours during a pandemic to vote for him #VoteBlue

U have no equal (oh, maybe Hillary) per cheating, fraud and dishonesty. U won't shut up, U=treacherous. This is obvious projection. U cheated and tried to steal '16 to continue ur "legacy" as bad as it was. Now U wants to steal '20 for Biden so U and ur Globalist handler ...
Trump wins unless all the dead people from Covid vote for Biden.
Basically, a vote for Biden is a vote for Kamala for President.  He won't be able to complete his term.  He'll be doing good to last a few months.
You realize Biden doesn‚Äôt currently hold office in our Government right? The best thing he can do to help is getting Trump out of office so...
NY Post columnist: Kamala Harris is political 'chameleon' with eye on 'Biden's job'.   Exactly! She can‚Äôt wait to push him outta her way!
But Biden is ahead??  Lmfao.    Clowns.
Kamala is an anchor baby, if something happens to Biden she can't become President,  both parents have to be Americans! Pelosi will become President! Then again " Obummer was President,  I never believed he was an American? AMERICA WAKE UP!  WE DON'T HAVE TO LET THIS HAPPEN!
Dear Mr Biden  it is only safe and secure if you have the infrastructure to support it.  Please take the cognitive test as you need help.
KAMALA isnt even an American! She's an anchor baby! If something happens to Biden she can't legally be President! There fore the next person to be PRESIDENT is Speaker of the house! You guessed it ' Pelosi!! Does anyone see the PLOT here?
Would you still support Tulsi if she becomes a Sheepdog like Bernie for Biden/Kamala?
Stand strong , The left Dems with hurt themselves without you doing anything!! You have handled everything, the best way you could of! Dont let Haters but you down, you are amazing and WEAK Biden, cant hold a candle to you.
Never feel sorry for Joe Biden. He a criminal, lying daily, racist, crook. Prison is to good for his crimes
They better get busy. November 3rd will be here before you know it and if you didn‚Äôt have a reason to vote for Biden before you do now.

Your so full of shit! You need to read more and stop listening to Pelosi, Biden can't make decisions and Kamala is an anchor baby, In the event that the President or Vice cant do the job, the next person in line is speaker of the house! PELOSI' God help us!
...and like I (and so many)said, your hubris is laughable. Overly ambitious, not as smart as you think you are.  Knowing Biden is mush brain you want to step in and take control. The Democrat Party has become the modern Fascists and you are part of the malicious, scurrilous mob.
Why aren't you investigating interference FOR Biden by China and Iran.  Both know that Biden is weak and will do their bidding, he'll bow to them same way Obama did.
You should examine Biden's lifelong racism which he conveniently lost to become VP and an identity gp. panderer. As a typical Democrat, he projects his sins on others. He opposed school bussing, school integration and befriended KKKByde, his "mentor. He wrote1994 Criminal Act ...
Joke of the century. Obama had the SLOWEST economic recovery since the Great Depression. He/biden were a disaster for our country in EVERY way. Trump fixed it all - despite the malicious, vicious fictions you Demons devised to harass him. YOU WILL LOSE again bc you are EVIL.
‚ÄúWE‚ÄôRE NOT GOING TO LET JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS CUT AMERICAS MEAT!‚Äù   *delayed applause*
Voters who vote party lines are usually very stupid as in this case -- and especially regarding Biden/Harris, two horrors and disasters for our country.
Now do Biden.    Loser
Let's be sure to elect Biden so we can stop this Middle East peace crap.  We can't have this.
Biden can‚Äôt even put together a coherent sentence and people still gon vote for em lmao
It was Obama who built the cages and put the children into them. Obama separated 38,000 ppl.  Trump provided schooling, medical needs, recreation and nutrition for them all.  NOT Biden/Obama.  Once again you lie.
Kamala totes alot of importance on science when discussing covid, but fails to recognize she and Biden have no chemistry.
I mandate Biden goes and  himself!
True, as far as we know Biden was never on Epstein's Lolita Express.
Yup. It should be obvious to one and all that a Biden Regime will be a rehash of Clinton/Obama/Hillary.  Don't know why this came to my head thinking of Bloomberg it's not even from my era. Money ain't for nothin' Lol
Makes $cents$ to me. Larry Summers has been advising Biden which means we would be soooooo EFFED.
She is a nasty, malicious, unethical hot mess. Proven during her days as prosecutor when she now did a 180 on everything she purported to believe just to be Biden's nominee. Dread to see her as President (Biden will turn the office over to her soon should he win). BUT Joe=loser.
Harris, a hot mess, a horrendous prosecutor, very malicious/nasty senator, has done 180 on her positions to become Biden's nominee. She would be a disaster and since Biden is only a placeholder, I dread what would happen to our country if she really took the reins.  NO to Harris.

There are more Biden supporters at trump rallies protesting the great president then came out to hear a vegetable and a communist
If Biden debates President Trump, it will be done remotely. Off camera he will have people writing answers on boards or into teleprompter so he can read the answers.
TW: suicide  anyone who reads this thread and thinks that voting in a national election means nothing, i don‚Äôt get you. no way in hell you can convince me a HRC admin would have resulted in the same or that a Biden admin ‚Äúwon‚Äôt change anything.‚Äù absolutely fucking bleak.
OMG, terrible thought occurred to me. what am I gonna tweet about when Trump loses? What kind of rage-induced tweeting can I get outta Biden??
Was Biden's mangling of her name all about disrespect?  Huh?
Why is Biden allowed to lie on Twitter?  Apparently because he‚Äôs a Democrat?
She only got 3% of the primary votes and won't bring him Calif. as it's already Democrat. She is a strategically bad move for Biden with her ton of stinky baggage, but I'm delighted.  VOTE RED!
He doesn‚Äôt have to come out of his basement.  His campaign is predicated on trump being trump and basically voting himself out of office every time he opens his mouth!  Biden/Harris just sit back at laugh at the stupidity!!
Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate who was personnel friends with a Klu Klux Klan leader.
Fellow white folks, let‚Äôs talk about what Joe Biden did yesterday.   Think about it. A member of the old boys‚Äô club DELIBERATELY and VERY PUBLICLY used his position and his societal privilege to elevate a member of a marginalized population to a position she richly deserves.1/3
I just watched the Biden/Harris presser. It made me proud to be an American again. I haven't felt this way for over 3 and a half years now. As they said, it's about the soul of our country. Come on America, we can do this come November 3rd.
Mama Kamala and Uncle Joe too the rescue.                           BIDEN &amp; HARRIS WILL SAVE THE USA!!!!!!!!!!              So happy üòÅ
Biden talking about Trump's racist rhetoric is about as rich as it gets.  And now it's the 'very fine people on both sides' lie.  He's just another shithead politician who enriched himself at your expense while gleefully shipping your jobs overseas.
He advised Biden not to extend an invitation to her! So it seems even Willie has had enough of her!!
And there is an even simpler reason: Biden would absolutely not have taken someone from a Senate seat who would be replaced by a GOP governor. Warren could have checked every box and he wouldn‚Äôt risk losing the seat.
Biden wanted the minority vote so bad... as a matter fact he‚Äôs even grown a bit entitled about it. But he previously announced that it was going to be a woman. Kamala is both black and Asian so... ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What is so interesting is that Biden didn't need her to bring in California.  Not a wise strategic move, Joe, but then nothing you've ever done has been wise.

She SOLD HER SOUL for this. Biden IS racist: opposed school integration-a "jungle," loved KKKByrd -"mentor &amp; friend," consistently made racist "jokes," surprised Obama was "clean&amp;articulate," used "n word" in Senate speeches many times, ad nauseam. Now he panders for black votes!
Joe Biden has a weird obsession with little girls ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è trump is trump Kamala a coon ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è we headed in a bad mf direction
In the 1920's Democrats were lynching, supporting KKK &amp; instituting Jim Crow. Learn your history! Republicans freed Democrats' slaves and fought for the Civil Rights laws against people like Thurmond, Byrd and yes - even Biden who opposed school integration and loved KKK Byrd.
Biden, lead us?! Ha. Your best joke yet.
Ever wonder who is running the PR campaign for the Lib looser's  Biden/Harris??? Just think, you could have had Bernie and ??? another Bernie.  Great choice Dems.
Trump/Pence win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Biden/Harris win in 2020 = Zionists win.  Either way humanity loses.
Yes, because a single mail truck, containing, let‚Äôs say 100 ballots (being generous), with a poll expected (again being generous) 55 votes Biden, 44 votes Trump, 1 other would do anything in moving the vote anywhere.  Think.
Biden has to have notes to make it through a friendly phone call.  Wow.  That's impressive.  He'll eat Putin's lunch for sure.
You know you ridin with Biden
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You will make a great team. I‚Äôm so proud to be voting Biden/Harris 2020.
I knew about her lackluster performance when she was in Cali but I choose to hope she‚Äôs become a better person since then. I‚Äôd still prefer her and Biden over Trump and Pence
You bet we do want Biden-Harris in the White House b/c Harris is not ultra liberal. But play your little tired games of ohhhhhhhhh that‚Äôs socialism. Socialism is giving $2T tax breaks to the 1% on the backs of the middle &amp; working class, Debbie.
You've sold your soul and all principles you may have had. This is tragic. Biden is a hapless mush who once was a segregationist, a racist "jokester" and a friend of KKKByrd he calls a mentor.   Biden WILL lose and you'll go down with him.
Biden could‚Äôve picked Howdy Doodie &amp; he wouldn‚Äôt have lost my vote. Oh &amp; Black folk miss me with the argument about prosecutors, prosecuting crimes! When a criminal attacks your family you don‚Äôt see color.
I love how they paint Biden and now Harris as far left.
If I had a choice to vote for Trump, Biden or Putin I would gladly vote for my comrade Vlad.
I totally agree and understand why Kamala was picked for him.   Biden will not run for a second term IF he wins. This gives her a head start for 2024.  Most likely Joe will not finish his first term which is the only way she could ever be POTUS.

What Bull. Biden, the real racist, supported segregation, KKKByrd, and worse. He can't do or say a thing his handlers don't script for him. And you should have taken Willie's advice bc you will not help him win. You won't get near the WH.
BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
This is what Pence said in AZ "As you all know, Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left," he said. "So given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, and abortion on demand, it's no surprise that he chose Senator Harris
Umm I think she will be talking and his lips will be moving! I‚Äôm not sure how she is going to get around some of her and Biden‚Äôs difference of opinions! Such as her saying she vehemently against Fracking he said he would not approve any new permits but would not stop it.
Divine 9, salons, barbershops, black organizations, black churches, picnics, barbecues, anyone with an ounce of decency; step and support Biden/Harris.  The goal collectively should be to rid the WH of the current inhabitants!!  VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!  IT DOES!
Biden does not remember that he was in that debate...sad
Pence will batch slap her in a debate just like she did to Biden

Biden/Harris do not support defunding the police and you know it. I‚Äôm sure you are looking forward to the Harris/Pence debate as much as America. If you continue to lie it will not go well for you at the debate. America will watch you be humiliated.
And you will Andrew. I have faith that Biden/Harris will unite the party. And the country will rally around them.
The 2020 Center Right Republican ticket is Biden/Kamala.  The 2020 Far Right Republican ticket is Trump/Pence.

23,000 LIES from the POTUS. Not one word from Trump is believed now. Unfit to lead. Go Biden. Truth matters!!!!!
Russia is so over. Trump's sanctions harsher than anything Obama/Biden did. "I'll have more flexibility after my re-election." to "Vlad."   You Democrats are hypocritical, malicious idiots.  WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW CHINA AND IRAN ARE WORKING TO ELECT BRAIN-DAMAGED BIDEN?!
America needs leadership from a President who will not try to divide us, or try to make us afraid of each other, but rather work to bring us together, to be an example that we can look up to and be proud to call our President. Trump has proven to be a divider. Biden will unite us
You think Biden could do anything? His virus "plan" was directly plagiarized from Trump's web page.  Biden's ads about American made/American jobs has been Trump's message and success for 4 years. Biden is a demented loser and you are backing the wrong horse.
...and about minorities, esp. Black ppl. Now Biden's talk is all scripted to cover up what the man actually is-a brain dead puppet. It's so obvious you are all over the place in your attempt to get revenge for being fired. You will NOT be resurrected. Biden will lose.
Trump IS expanding the Republican Party with outreach to all minorities; he will have higher black and hispanic vote counts than ever before. Biden is a proven racist: his "jokes", his friendships w/ KKK Byrd and stance against school integration, his patronizing talk to ...

My gut on the ground says its about +2 - +4 for Biden, and +6 - +10 for Kelly ...... State is hard to get a gauge on at times because the pockets that are conservative are extremely conservative
thanks,i used to be like a huge trump supporter but there‚Äôs so many things that have happened that make me question him but it‚Äôs not like biden is a much better choice. it‚Äôs a really scary time we all live in and the people who want to do the actual good will never get the chance
Murton, you need to smarten up. Pres. Trump is the BEST, most hard-working, patriotic, efficient and capable president in decades.  If you vote for dementia-challenged Biden, you've said it all.
Benghazi will be used against her.   Biden will be the bobblehead the MIC, Wall St., Zionists, War Mongers want and Rice will put muscle behind it and be the enforcer.
Biden is a lifelong racist who only "evolved" when he was made Obama's VP. He continues his racist "jokes" and alliances. He can't help himself and has made many Freudian slips during this campaign. Lewis can't change that. Trump for ALL races and religions.
Obama and Hillary will pick Susan Rice to be Biden's VP.
"Is there an equivalent on the left tearing down Trump?‚Äù Observant, aren't u? CNN wouldn't exist w/o liars &amp;propagandists for Dems/now Biden like u to string public along with your constant lies, omissions, and fictions. Look at yourself in the mirror to answer your question.UGH!
can you ride a bike?Joe is in better shape than you. Tell your conspiracy creators Joe does not need a nursing home.       Joe Fox-Trolling Mask Bike Ride Sets Twitter Ablaze
My point is this.  You were blessed to be born free and  now that‚Äôs being threatened.  Look  Portland/around you.  Don‚Äôt believe me?  Go to Fla, 90 miles So. is Cuba.  They don‚Äôt have a country. Thats why they‚Äôre fleeing. Take a look.  Vote Biden, that‚Äôs your future.
Me trying to explain how Joe Biden can win the election
Ask me again why I despise Dems as much as Repubs and why I will not vote for either one of the Israel Firsters.   Report: Biden personally intervened to get the word 'occupation' removed from the Democratic Party platform
Biden‚Äôs up 10%
Biden, lol.
My MIL accused me of brainwashing my husband into voting for Biden. Not the craziest thing she‚Äôs said about me, but it‚Äôs new, at least.
Someone PLEASE stop Biden from talking
The Dems are corrupt, too.  If it happens at all it will be a media circus and no one will actually be made accountable. I am supporting Biden and other Dem candidates but not very hopeful.
When he said this I laughed so hard. He LITERALLY insulted the black community. So much for, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt really black if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs staff apologized on his account. Joe probably doesn‚Äôt even know what he said.
Biden wnats all illegals working in America to receive free healthcare. This is after they take jobs away from a hardworking American, who doesn‚Äôt receive free healthcare.
make more you tube videos.....give your opinion on 2020 riots,BLM, trump, Biden whatever. There great
Chuck Schumer does an irrupt change in Democrats stand against school‚Äôs opening up. Now pushing hard to get teachers unions on board to open schools. The reason, if kids get sick on a large scale, President Trump will be blamed hurting him in November. Dems can‚Äôt win with Biden
Joe Biden has a plan! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why is Biden going to church regularly when Delaware is recommending those over 65 stay away?
And Biden? Is he um...masterful!  Lol
Biden 2030. Good one
The  is amongst the greatest of God‚Äôs creations on Earth. It would be a desecration to allow uranium mining in such a sacred place. I join  in opposing uranium mining at the Grand Canyon.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
How about them Biden comments? Lol can‚Äôt condemn one without the other ü§°
Hungry Joe Biden üò±
Honestly, screw Joe Biden, he‚Äôs going to ignore progressives during his entire presidency. However, Trump is a much worse option and don‚Äôt be ignorant by voting for third party or writing in Bernie Sanders name. #voteforbiden
Meh. I‚Äôve heard that Biden can destroy God himself, so removing some extra melanin isn‚Äôt impressive.
Media watches Biden...media in full out desperation mode.
THE DANGEROUS, MORONIC, IGNORANT, INCOMPETENT, INEPT, DELUSIONAL POS, NOW SAID:!!!!!  "OPEN THE SCHOOLS"!!!!!  "COVID-19 WILL JUST GO AWAY"!!!!!  WEAR THE DAMN MASK!!!!!  VOTE BIDEN AND BLUE, 2020!!!!!
Joe Biden is actively working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden.
Based upon Joe's recent videos....Joe Biden is working to, quote, denigrate Joe Biden......
VP Biden you are correct to be critical of Gov Ducey‚Äôs responses to COVID 19 in terms of being a model per Trump.  But the Governor has encouraged local leaders to act and not fight common sense like Gov Kemp.  And AZ has made considerable progress recently.
Team Biden. Nice try though.
Congratulations!  One suggestion: tho I'm looking forward to your debates w/ Biden, I caution you against attacking his dementia or side effects thereof as I believe that would bring ppl to his defense. Pls. stick to the issues. There are many legit ones to show you in top form.
Obama/Biden separated upwards of 38,000 persons, built &amp; housed children in the cages the MSM &amp;lying filthy Dems ascribed to  PresTrump, whose facilities are clean, w/schooling, recreation, medical help, etc.  Also, Obama/Biden never re-did immigration laws as promised.
I hope Biden does choose Rice.  The Professional Liar in Chief has lots of filthy baggage. She'll help him lose.
Biden has always been a racist. He said the "n" word at least 13 times in a Senate speech, was good friends w/ KKKByrd, fought against school integration, initiated the 1994 Crime bill, is a racist "jokester," --just an awful person who now pretends to be Blacks' best friend. Ha!
Why don't you get Biden to explain?!
Big Pharma and the Biden campaign DO NOT support this type of messaging...please stop...
Because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not voting for Trump‚Äù does not equal ‚ÄúI‚Äôm voting for Biden,‚Äù as you know full well. Don‚Äôt be disingenuous, it‚Äôs tiring.
My wife read me the tweet and I said "He's talking to Biden like he talks to Nicole Grigg."
Gonna be hilarious with Carey as BidenüòÇüòÇ
Obviously most Trump supporters aren‚Äôt like this  But if I was one of the ‚Äúpeaceful supporters‚Äù I‚Äôd consider speaking out against this  And I encourage Biden people to do the same
Here‚Äôs the thing, Do you think Trump would suspend HIS campaign with the tables turned? I think he‚Äôd double down, and call Biden weak.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong. #VoteHimOut2020
We now know how Biden reacted to the news. Imagine what Trump would be saying if the reverse had happened. Exactly. Vote.
Could not agree more!   Trump would be making ads calling Biden weak and a loser if he was in a hospital bed.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt have.  In fact, he‚Äôd probably be running ads that Biden was week and a loser for getting sick.
This is only acceptable if the Biden campaign is aware how terminal this is
I guess they don't know their history than if they're sidin' with Biden!!
I'm bothered by Biden continuing his campaign based on one negative test. That does not mean he is free and clear. He needs to act more responsibly that POTUS.
Biden should demand Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù stop campaigning for President Trump first.
Biden should demand Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù stop campaigning for President Trump first.
They just can‚Äôt wrap their heads around the fact that an intelligent man could answer questions without help (and without lying), because they can‚Äôt see past their own candidate who prefers to fling his own poo at the zookeepers.
This is why a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for bringing decency back to the White House.
This is absolute proof if biden wins he will not investigate trump or anyone in his adminstration. Weak.
Trump says unicorns are a hoax, a unicorn kicks trump in the gut, what does that have to do with Biden ?
Do you think in his head Biden is like ‚Äúkinda hope he dies tho...‚Äù
You literally tagged her name and you couldn‚Äôt even spell it right in your tweet? Jesus. And ‚Äúfix‚Äù the Rose Garden lol. She isn‚Äôt gonna be FLOTUS. whether you love trump or hate him, BidEn (not Bidon) can‚Äôt win against him. as long as he stays alive.
on a vent just until the final call comes in to push biden over the top lmfao
Was Biden's speech today the last straw for PutinPuppet?
People saying ‚ÄòFuck Donald Trump‚Äô or  ‚ÄòFuck Joe Biden‚Äô...
Seriously, though. Where‚Äôs Hunter?  Here,  lays out the real reason the former Vice President‚Äôs son is staying as far away from the public eye as possible.
Classy reaction from Biden
Wallace framed multiple questions in ways that *help* Trump and his narratives. He was trying to go after Biden at least twice, but Donnie is such a moron he couldn‚Äôt get out of the way.
If Trump can't do the town hall debate, Joe Biden should still show up and do it all himself.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, tested negative for coronavirus on Friday morning.
Biden, that‚Äôs the most class act thing I think I‚Äôve seen in awhile. In fact, it might be the classiest thing I‚Äôve seen come from the Democratic Party towards President Trump since his inception into presidency. I commend you for that. üëè
Yeah, we need a third party, the Dems have fallen hard to the right. Biden isa symptom.
The latest: *President Trump, First Lady experiencing mild symptoms after COVID positive tests (according to White House, First Lady tweet) * Joe Biden awaiting test results *VP Pence, Karen Spence test negative (AP)
NBC and "Saturday Night Live" gave viewers a sneak peek on Thursday of actor Jim Carrey suited up as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.

Biden WAS investigating corruption in Burisma, which is exactly why an inept prosecutor who refused to investigate needed to be removed. Your story doesn‚Äôt match up with the timeline. Trump then illegally abused his power and got impeached.
Please pray for President Trump &amp; the First Lady‚Äôs fast recovery, and of course Trump‚Äôs re-election. Even being quarantined, President Trump is 1,000 times more effective than Biden can ever hope to be.üòÅ
you know damn well if it was Biden, 45‚Äôs followers would say the same damn thing! quit clutching your pearls like u think this is 1-sided issue. so many would call for the death of Biden; many of y‚Äôall would be silent. but let‚Äôs focus on a staffer that‚Äôs not a staffer anymore.üòÜ
You are a gracious and kind man, Joe Biden üòå
Get the morning's latest developments on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump testing positive for the coronavirus.
Joe Biden should be tested on a regular and ongoing basis.   I don‚Äôt know if that would be every third day or what.   But continuously.
Never trust the oil industry. They don‚Äôt care about you, your communities or the environment. They can do their job without accessing areas that are pristine and need to be protected. Once an area is pillaged it‚Äôs gone forever. #greedyoil
Actually....you're at fault for what happened at the debate!!! Biden was wrong on many counts and you didn't fact check him once.....but Trump.....yes, let's fact check him!!! What were you conspirering with Pelosi and the leftist media about???
I think he should kiss Biden and Pelosi on the mouth....
You realize Biden wanted him fired because he refused to investigate Burisma, right? The prosecutor was inept and corrupt, and Biden, the US, and Western Europe all wanted the prosecutor removed because he was corrupt.
Okay... strictly hypothetical here. Anyone know what‚Äôs gonna happen if Trump gave Biden covid and they both die???
Tuesday: Trump makes fun of biden for wearing a mask during the debate Thursday: trump gets covid
It seemed on TV that Trump leaned toward Biden when attacking Joe's son
Trump makes fun of Biden for wearing a mask... he just tested positive for COVID-19 LMFAOOOO
If trump's big ass mouth infected Biden on Tuesday...
How many years was Biden in office?  How many things has he done that he has ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to do?
Article yestdy said no Trp's  wearing masks  (It's mandated n Ohio inside also)! Guess IVANKA didn't wanna minimize her  $1,700 "outfit"! Not counting the $1,400 WHITE (excuse me it's Oct! I'm frm S.TX)ha! Channel bag &amp; jewelry &amp; etc., etc.,! Heard Biden side did! ‚úåüíô‚úå
Maybe he was hoping to give it to Biden. Would it even be shocking if he is an asymptomatic super spreader?
Unfortunately it‚Äôs not true. Looks like you were wrong again
Was Joe Biden lying when he claimed in the debate that he‚Äôs not a radical leftist or does he just not realize he‚Äôs not really in charge?  It doesn‚Äôt matter.  One way or another, a Biden-Harris White House will be extreme and must not happen. #MAGA2020
Folks in AZ: it‚Äôs really important that you vote for Biden. He‚Äôs not my first choice either but he‚Äôs the only chance we have to save some semblance of democracy.   Please vote for #biden.

My daughter Praylin and I had Civic, American and Navajo History class this morning. Praylin asked me does President Trump and Vice President Biden care about us and the Rez?
‚ÄúPresidential debates test next to nothing that is germane to the performance of presidential duties. Biden‚Äôs ungraceful scrum with someone unhinged and uninformed was an event with no analogue in a well-managed presidency.‚Äù
If he's pretending to support Biden now, it's because he realizes his endorsement is toxic. This isn't complicated.

Biden is Catholic.  Dems are against policies that harm the Earth, women,  POC, the poor.  Catholics bash Biden cz he believes girls and women shd keep authority over their own bodies, have access to contraception, their medical decisions w their families.

He tried but Chris changed the subject.  was DISGRACEFUL to let Chris attack the President because of a paper hit peace but not bring up Congress' investigation of Hunter Biden. The apple does fall far from the tree.
Perfect example of how Biden isn‚Äôt great, but he is the less of two evils
Now Fauci and they both should make it clear they are available to a Biden administration.
wait biden‚Äôs last name is harris?
I watched for Biden not you
Peter, I think Biden will be pressured into taking climate action. We're going to be relentless, loud, and "alarming". He seems ready to listen. At least I hope so. If not, we'll get louder.
Was he talking about intimidation? Because there‚Äôs only one side I have received intimidated from and they put Biden on their ballot.
Joe Biden: Will you shut up Trump: haha your dead son did coke
Maybe someday Biden will be as popular as Bernie.
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBiden said in the debate that Antifa is an 'idea' ‚Äî just days after the WH moved to label Antifa as a terror group. Here‚Äôs a photo of the unarmed man in Portland, OR who was shot &amp; murdered on Aug 29, 2020 by the ‚ÄúAntifa idea‚Äù  #FoxNews

Just checked yours.....who's illegally directing these ".coms" to Biden??
also as someone with a minor speech impediment from a brain injury that i literally NEVER talk ab bc im so embarrassed, can the tl not make fun of biden for his like ouchies
...it‚Äôs slowly getting easier to vote biden... like at first it was settling... but now... maybe willing...

Democrats are getting scared.  As they should be.
Chris Wallace said that he‚Äôd be a ‚Äútransparent‚Äù debate moderator. Shamefully, he was the 3rd debater, demonstrated his bias against Trump, brought up liberal issues like climate change that don‚Äôt poll high, &amp; looked away at Biden‚Äôs false statements &amp; rude behavior
And what he has done is killed more American people in 47 months than Biden has done in 47 years. Case closed indeed.
It was a worthless affair. Except for a few times Biden told him to shuddup
Trevor Reacts to the First Biden-Trump Debate | The Daily Social Distanc...  via
Biden was not wearing a wire during the debate ‚Äî the video shows a crease in Biden‚Äôs dress shirt, which is accentuated by the bright TV lights. #disinformation #LiesAfterLies
Fact check: Trump claims Biden policies killed over 308,000 veterans, but that‚Äôs not what investigators found.
Funny you would say that. I've heard Trump supporters say Trump was doing some type of psychological operation to confuse Biden. I've seen a lot of "4-D Chess" and "Trust The Plan" posts from the faithful.
The differnce being...the tax story was a news paper hit peace, the info about Hunter Biden was an investigation by Congress. Total disgrace
I would have liked Biden to say that if Trump keeps interrupting, he won't let Trump have any more debates. Partly because that debate was insufferable and nobody should have to watch sequels.

I know this: #ChrisWallace can have ALL of my medals and ribbons from the army. That he restrained himself from going up on that stage,and b*tch-slapping BOTH #trump and #biden, says it all about him as a professional. A lesser moderator beats the hell out of both them. Speaking
Chris was too busy playing nursemaid to Biden.
Tell the truth, Bunker Biden!
From what I heard last night Joe Biden said he didn't and then his next breath was, the Green New Deal is great...lol
Oh a confirmed lie. Just like hunter biden making "millions without any experience in energy"
Why did Chris Wallace attack the President on a hit peace article in a news paper about taxes but let Joe Biden off the hook from an investigation from Congress about Hunter Biden's dealings with Russia and sex trafficking?
Last night, Trump did what he does best -- lie to the American people.  He lied when he said:  "I paid millions of dollars." -Trump on his taxes  America needs an honest President they can trust. America needs Joe Biden.
Quick,anyone who watched that #Debates2020 and is good at doctoring gifs,we ALL need trump and Biden's face superimposed onto this gif from "grumpy old men". Consider it a charitable act. ü§£üò™
Just thinking about how the dnc needed every single dem to drop out and endorse Biden to beat Bernie. Imagine how last night would have went if the scales weren‚Äôt tipped
‚ÄúTrump is utterly incapable of running to the center of public opinion, of making an appeal to a broader range of voters. So he just gets louder and meaner with the same old right-wing Republican message...‚Äù
#Debates2020  - Trump should have had a sharp paragraph on each area. Then let Biden ramble around. Missed opportunity for Trump.
ICYMI Trump is still racist and Biden is still Biden. Last night proved nothing, well unless you needed a good reminder how racist Trump really is, I mean he was given the chance to condemn white supremacy on a sliver platter and he couldn‚Äôt.
#Debates2020 - Stu you read it correctly. Biden hung in there. But a melee! A mishmash. No one won!!! Not what I wanted!!!
Watch $OZSC tomorrow. Everyone knows Biden lost. The market is going to soar. Especially if a stimulus package is voted on and passed. We‚Äôll know by 4:00pm Oct 2nd. Trump won and he‚Äôs going to win this election.

Biden bouta yell DJ D Wreck! Cut the beat!
I have so many thoughts. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by Wallace as a moderator. Biden did himself and the Dems no harm. Trump was a horrific joke (no surprise). I thought Biden did a good job appealing to the power of the people, especially given the circumstances.
we aren‚Äôt here for a long time, we are here for just enough FREAKING time to vote for Joe Biden
I think republicans have spewed BS about Biden. If you want to deconstruct someone then look at Trump and his affection for porn stars...while his wife was pregnant with their son. #StormyDaniels
I wasn't in it for 45 or even Biden. I wanted to watch Chris Wallace.
I thought when Law &amp; Order came up, Biden shd've criticized Barr's corrupt protection of Trump.
won against Chris Wallace and Joe Biden hands down. #TrumpPence2020

It was however excellent training for President to be Biden on how to handle an insane head of state.
After more than a year of circling each other, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio. Here's how things went.
I saw this Biden trying to speak
Donald Trump and Joe Biden sparred Tuesday in their first of three debates leading up to the Nov. 3 election. Here's a look at how their statements stacked up with the facts.
Hastag Nursemaid Wallace for Biden.
I know a family member very close to me who I love who will not vote for Trump but ‚Äújust doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù about Biden.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden met Tuesday night for the first of three presidential debates.
Biden may not be your first choice but if it gets rid of trump why tf would you not vote for him. Voting third party is a vote for trump.
Wallace was a great nursemaid for Biden.
Didnt know Wallace was being paid as Biden's nursemaid but I do know. No surprise there.
i thought biden did fine, but yeah i think trump just came off as totally emotionally mature enough to do his job
the only thing i can see is maybe some people who were deciding to vote or not (for trump) may just go "nah."  but yeah.  the best moments were biden going "will you just shut up"
Joe Biden isn‚Äôt going to fix this country but he will prevent it from being worse
President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night. Here's how the event played out online.
‚Äúyou‚Äôre  disgrace‚Äù Biden 2020
Honestly, and not saying that will be the takeaway, but if Biden came across a tad shell shocked it‚Äôs not different than what ‚Äúthe average American‚Äù has felt for 7 months
Biden because he didn‚Äôt shit his pants. Maybe. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Idk how many times Chris told Trump to be quite but never once told Biden to be quite while Trump was talking
Good final answer from Biden
TBH I was only tuned in to watch Chris Wallace. It's breaking my heart what 45 is doing to that dear, sweet man. Biden was cracking me up, but that's not what debates are supposed to be about, so I'll wait for the video clips later.
"will you urge your supporters to stay calm and will you pledge to not claim victory until after the votes are counted?"  Biden: yes  Trump: I don't trust these people they cheat blah blah blah
I‚Äôm in the radical left and I still support Biden.
Biden is not an idiot. Trump sounds like an idiot every time he speaks because he divides us. At every opportunity.
Biden is not losing the radical left lmao
Biden just lost this holy shit
Why does Biden have that been in his right hand????  It's been there the entire debate.
Biden needs to be fucking awake at the beginning of the next debate. He waited a full hour to wake up for this one
Watching the debate right now! I was so-so on Biden before but I‚Äôm very impressed w him now. His debate skills are impressive and he clearly did his homework. Can‚Äôt wait to hear more ü§©

Trump going dirty on Biden‚Äôs son.   Like Don Jr. doesn‚Äôt need rebab?
The moderator said ‚Äúcan you condemn white supremacists right now?‚Äù And trump couldn‚Äôt. He changed the subject and made it about Biden and antifa. THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT! How is this okay?! #Debates2020
President to be Biden is getting some intense training on how to handle an insane head of state.
Biden shows some anger!
Best part of tonight was Biden calling Trump a Clown. That sums up this debate.
Wallace expects a citizen to direct a State‚Äôs National Guard?  Biden is not the President.
Biden lied to america on tv tonight accusing everything on trump lies he is communist
If Biden straight up just punched Trump, he‚Äôd pull away in a landslide
Biden‚Äôs meds kicked in
Biden is about to jump that stage and strangle Trump, and I honestly hope that happens
Yep buden lied tonight big time and the 3.5 million dallors from Moscow mayors wife sick joe biden
People are claiming Biden is being childish when Trump is the one who's constantly interrupting him and the MODERATER #Debates2020
Kinda hate how Biden is essentially equating racism to bullying. Not really the best response
Trump has the right to talk biden is lying to world and America oh yes
Yes and trump and biden are fighting tonight on the debate caught biden lying on tv
Joe Biden finds this debate COMEDYüòÇüòÇ
I don't blame Biden for calling Trump names. If I was debating with that orange buffoon, I'd have words too.   #Debates2020
We have an absolutely lovely 3rd party candidate I would be delighted to vote for any other time... hell, I'm considering helping is campaign next time. AZ is too close for me to risk voting for anyone other than Biden. If I were in a solid blue state, I'd have options.
Biden really missed out on the opportunity to say, ‚ÄúWell, which of us were ON Law &amp; Order?‚Äù
Biden going off on Trump is the shit I like to see
My 4 and 6 year old nieces behave less childish than our President. I mean he has pointed out valid things with Biden (crime bill, being in the govt for 47 years, etc) but it doesn‚Äôt make him any less embarrassing to watch.
I need Biden to cuss at trump
‚ÄúThis guy...‚Äù  Joe Biden speaks for all of us.
Can Biden tag out for Kamala?
Biden just did this to Trump

Let‚Äôs hope Biden blows it out just as easily.
Trump really said Biden plays more golf than him üò≠üò≠
He really just randomly said Nancy Pelosi? And Biden deadass Shushed him IM CRYING
Biden said ‚Äúshut up man‚Äù
I need Biden to finish like one sentence
Biden has owned him.
If the DNC didn‚Äôt say fuck the left, maybe Biden would be able to channel his bad like Trump canAnd how come nothing more on Biden‚Äôs wire he was wearing???
Because Biden stutters &amp; Trump‚Äôs Christie strategy was to interrupt Biden, knowing for a stutter that can make him appear confused. Classy, use a disability against him. I imagine Trump would constantly touch his mouth to make it harder for Biden to lip read if he was deaf.
He said that Juan? Hey Juan I have never heard any conservatives or Republicans wishing Joe Biden would die , or Hillary for that matter, people are yelling I hope he dies, f- - k Trump and spitting at supporters in front of hospital he‚Äôs at , go ahead Juan deny it.
(Reminder: Biden was handed the worst economic collapse since WWII, by a Republican President) Well actually... the trophy for the worst economy &amp; unemployment claims goes to Trump for his failed Covid-19 response. The shit u guys sling at Dems is the shit from your own toilet
Somebody please make a bleach &amp; club soda with a twist of lime for Trump &amp; shove a flashlight up his ass and tell him to get back to work. We have an election I want Biden to win fair &amp; square

That is just not true. You should do more research. Testing everyone was the plan, but only the early arrivals were tested. Most everyone was on ‚Äúthe honor system‚Äù to gain entry. Trump and Biden and their entourages were not tested.
If Biden had a unifying bone in his body he wouldn't have had negative ads that needed to be pulled.  If the attack from China didn't bring us together, it ain't happening.
Biden is an idiot!
GOP Worries They Backed The Wrong Horse As Biden's Lead Grows Following ...  via
It's Kamela "hunting Trump supporters down" Harris, just like if Biden lives long enough to win normally.
Dear Senator Murphy, with all due respect, you are full of BS! Putin doesn‚Äôt want Trump 4 more years any more than China does. They both would welcome Biden with open arms because he is weak and can be bought.
Hell no! Trump wouldn't stop.. actually Trump would take advantage of it and tell his supporters Biden wasn't strong enough to fight the virus, and he would mock that Biden used a mask &amp; still got the virus. Hell no. Biden needs to go all the way
You will still work more and harder for the American people while you have this than Biden does on his best day. Feel better Mr. President and First Lady!
No. Biden has run a clean and safe campaign. He shouldn‚Äôt be held back because trump did not.
It's a Biden boat parade?
Biden did Not you
Oh the mindless Libs. Biden gets to joke but you can‚Äôt stand when someone else who dares think differently than you does.
I thought Biden would get it. I‚Äôm sure they have spies in each camp. Here cough on this podium he‚Äôs going to touch...
40 years of video recordings and legislation don't lie.    #Biden is, was and always will be a racist.    Of course, that's not the only reason they chose him to be the Presidential candidate.  It was just one of the prerequisites.
Trump spoke 2 minutes - Biden spoke uninterrupted for 2 minute... Trump began to speak &amp; Biden interrupted him 3 times... off to the races üëèüò±
Trump was in control of that train wreck.   It was a perfect set up for debate 2.0.  Watch for the change in format that Biden demands and Trump accepts.  It's important.
More  trash...Chris Wallace and Hoe Biden were the first to interrupt
Biden supporters at a rally.
"Pro-life Evangelicals for Biden"  Now that sounds like a bright bunch
These cast members, are they Biden supporters?
Fair point, if Trump was a disaster the MSM would want to see two more debates just like it as they will be great commercials for the Biden campaign.
I disagree, a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Satan.

Biden can fix it. He just wanted to wait 47 years to do it.
Please don't take voting for granted. It's not that easy this year. Trump and the Republicans are trying to suppress votes to their advantage, so be prepared &amp; educate yourselves about your state and city rules. Make your vote count
Biden is the only racist running for President.  Both candidates have over 30 years of video record to prove this.
Biden wasn‚Äôt sending out tweets he was reading the answers.
As I‚Äôve said before there are two presidential candidates in November. Donald Trump versus Donald Trump. There will be people who will vote for him and people who will vote against him but no one is voting for anyone else.  That is why there are no people at Biden‚Äôs rallies.
So all these stories are false.    Then tell us, just wtf is wrong with #Biden and how much longer will he be able to hold a conversation?
Question? Biden also mentioned that he had plans to built 400K special reenforced buildings for the his New Green Deal, (I hope I‚Äôm wording that correct); but if USA has roughly 330M people, then who gets them? Only the top elite w/everyone else SOL?
Trump deserves to seat someone though. "The people should get to choo-" Trump stomped Biden by saying they DID choose. They chose four years. Not three. That is obliteration.  If Republicans pulled some near election BS in the past they were in the wrong and they're hypocrites.
Biden playing 007
You really need to do your research. He has condemned them! You can't tell people not to vote for them or to vote for them. That's goes against the constitution. The President nor Biden can control who and what groups vote for them. STOP with the division!
Trump‚Äôs a racist who refused to condemn white supremacy. He brought up Hunter Biden‚Äôs addiction in front of millions of people. He agreed to 2 minute time limit and couldn‚Äôt even stick to it. He argued with the moderator. Don‚Äôt forget Trump name calls literally everyone lmao tf
Xi Jinping is elbow deep in Biden's fop bunghole. Biden wouldn't want to upset his master by shutting down Chinese air travel and embarrassing him.  Biden would have got millions killed.
I live in MAGAtown USA and I‚Äôm voting for Joe Biden.
I know you trumpets don‚Äôt read... ‚ÄúWhen Telemundo announced the results of its informal survey, it deliberately pointed out that the results weren‚Äôt scientific, slightly moderating the uselessness of sharing such information in the first place.‚Äù  #dumbGOP
The only thing anyone should be undecided about is whether to vote for Joe Biden and wait to see how the dust  settles on and after November 3 or vote for Joe Biden and seek asylum in Canada on or before November 3.
Yep. trump is a liar. Case closed. And that doesn‚Äôt even take into consideration that everything Biden did was for America while everything trump did was to America while mewling enablers like you held her down. #RapistInChief #NikkiIsComplicit
Though Biden got 3 more minutes of uninterrupted talking time.
I'm with you My Friend!!! Decency will win out in the end! Biden will heal America and God knows we need healing!!!
Because if he says so that‚Äôs the truth. Come to think of it the media thinks that too. Biden is a feckless old man who I am beginning to think people just feel sorry for and are willing to look the other way knowing he‚Äôs a lying sack.
He needs to be sued for defamation of character for parsing a quote to fit what he wanted it to say. He must publicly apologize nationally for knowingly falsely accusing you of what he said to help Biden or admit he‚Äôs that inept as to not research a question he‚Äôs asking.
SMH Chris! You either failed to research the full quote from Trump in NC or you purposely parsed his words to help Biden. THAT is defamation of character toward Trump and definition of character about yourself.
Dems consider a Biden Presidency the same way they view James Comey as FBI director
I noticed Biden didn't disavow the anarchists and urban terrorists.    But he did throw the Green Deal under the bus again.
Same poll says Biden won the 2nd by 60% too.
Biden said his son getting $millions because of his dad was a lie.
Chris Wallace Accused of Bias Amid Backlash Over First Trump-Biden Debate -  ‚úÖ Via -  #NeonNettle
Biden is a great choice.
If Biden, Obama, Hilary, or anyone else told ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù to ‚Äústand back and standby‚Äù the Right would lose their shit, and they‚Äôd be right to do so. Don‚Äôt be a hypocrite and treat Trump‚Äôs words any different.
Tells you how much Trump was being unruly, and how Biden had more integrity
What is it with you stupid people? Green new deal is not Biden's plan.. Biden is endorsing it. He will implement it. He will fund the professionals in that field. He is not taking credit for someone else's environmental plan.. unlike Trump who takes credit for what others did
Obviously President Trump won the debate, and everyone will be talking strategy points over and over.  Personally, I think President Trump clearly showed that whether Biden is shot or not; he‚Äôs sound enough to stand trial for TREASON!!
Biden supports Antifa. The President tried to debate that point and Wallace interrupted with ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre done‚Äù!
Personally, I think that was the main point of the strategy tonight; Biden proven sound to stand trial for TREASON!!!
Wallace is helping Biden.
VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STATUE PROTEST - theres video of it and it‚Äôs clear.      not the pathetic twist you know MSM too pk on it which you proliferated. Biden lies
Joe Biden, on Covid, you and your wig are winning bitch!
Because Biden was depending on Wallace to help him.
Trump didn't let Biden finish; probably doesn‚Äôt let Melania finish either
So I have some extra yard signs from the primaries and want to repurpose them. What anti trump thing should I put on them? Someone help with ideas because I only have one and it‚Äôs this. But being one of two Biden supporters in my neighborhood I‚Äôm slightly scared.
Biden didn‚Äôt rebut or debate. How could he have won?
The debate was a wash. Trump supporters love him, Biden supporters love him and people who don‚Äôt trust Wallace or Fox News know they are right!
I just wish he‚Äôd put his smirk on his face while debating Biden! Not to mention, the camera angle for Biden was straight on making him look so sincere? Whereas President Trump‚Äôs was offset/back and he appeared tired/stressed? MAGA
Biden calls tomorrow‚Äôs lid in the car ride home ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
President Trump had bad camera set up! Looked a tad bit tired/stressed; I wish he would have smiled a bit while throwing his jabs! Because he was debating both he appeared on defense. (No offense intended) Biden looking into camera sincerely?? MAGA ‚ô•Ô∏è
Biden definitely on  #Debates2020
Where‚Äôs the JUSTICE in Biden‚Äôs world if the Democrat controlled states ABUSE Law and Order by IMMEDIATELY releasing criminals without bond/bail, and many times refusing to file charges!!!!!
Biden definitely on the debate but Americans lost respect on a global level #Debates2020
Oh waaah, Biden brought him up
I don't know anybody can sit there and watch Joe Biden lie his ass off  and stil want to vote for this moron.... vote red 2020 TRUMP
Joe Biden ... WAS AS SLEAZY AS YOU CAN GET ... #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica
No to Joe Biden  He is bad for America and bad to the American people
That was a  disaster the moderator is not impartial Just by the way he speaks, the way he acted hes on sleepy Joe side Joe Biden is a joke America does not want him as a president and he was throwing insults at president trump so Mr. President responded in kind
EVER!! It‚Äôs making President Trump look a bit flustered?  Wallace is debating for Biden!!  I call BS
Camera setup is also wrong, straight on for Biden to make him appear sincere; but back and off center for President Trump so we‚Äôre getting side view??  I call BS!!
Chris Wallace is taking Joe Biden‚Äôs side in this!
You heard it folks! Biden says hes the Democratic Party. So hes BLM, Antifa, violence in the streets, the Green New Deal. This IS the Democratic Party!!
Whats the Biden plan?
OMG!! I‚Äôm yelling at my own TV!! Biden is lying ü§• checking his notes üìù but Wallace interrupts President Trump!
Biden is getting his ass handed to him by Trump. I can't watch anymore. It's pathetic and depressing üòî
Is US better off after 47 years with Biden?
Ok the best so far is Biden saying coos should have psychologist with them... unbelievable!
Its apparent that POTUS is pro America and Biden is not! Biden is a total racist and could care leas about us Americans
Biden‚Äôs son let DuPont walk for raping his 3 year old daughter!!
So Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged for doing drugs.  Joe just lied.
Really? Biden brought his son up. It‚Äôs not off limits if you bring it up. Put your big  girl panties on.  So many feelings
You've never called the national guard? Biden will let them do it themselves!!!
Biden talking about suburbs while he lives in a 10K square foot house he acquired from DuPont because his corruption!!  Dead son let DuPont walk after raping his own 3 yr old daughter!!!

Biden called him a clown!!! Disrespectful
Biden is so dumb, he didn‚Äôt even know about the airports during the revolutionary war.
trump has set the bar so low that he will exceed expectations as long as he doesn‚Äôt strip naked and started flinging poop at the audience from his soiled diaper. Only a perfect performance or a horrible performance by Biden will even be deemed newsworthy.
You're out of your mind mister! Biden released his taxes a few hours ago. Put your money where your mouth is. Tell Trump to release his taxes &amp; let's find out if your tweet is as accurate as you may think. I challenge you!
You really are out of your mind. Did you aee Biden's tax returns he released a few hours ago? Tell Trump to release his tax returns and put your money where your mouth is mister! I challenge you
Without a doubt! But with his earpiece with people feeding him rebuttals and his every 30 minute ‚Äúpotty‚Äù breaks who knows, he could become the Bionic Biden &amp; fly around the room. We will see! What a corrupt circus!! ü§°
#WeThePeople say #Trump 100% Fake news media will say Biden.
Anybody watching debates? I heard there will be a drinking game; everytime Biden says something we can't understand we take a shot????
Not Biden.
Right?    Trump has the Intel Community at his disposal.  He should be able to tap the comms to an ear piece and short-circuit Biden's whole show.
Many votes would like to see if Biden can stand and converse coherently for 90 mins.  DNC is like, what does it matter?  He's not actually going to be the "President" President.  We'll have other people to do that.
Obama should be Biden‚Äôs guest.
Wow. Trump talks about 95% more than biden.  Obviously he's also had some mishaps.  Biden can rarely get a couple sentences out.  He can't handle the pressure. Or I guess we'll see
Biden is SO full of it!
When was the last time Biden didn‚Äôt pay taxes? Asking for a friend....
I think it's a good idea. The moderator would spend most the time correcting trump. But it's an advantage for Biden. Biden knows facts, Trump doesn't. Biden can fact check him, Trump can only deny and won't be able to fact check Biden
Biden needs Texas or Florida to win
Hold on a minute you have to count all the reporters they are Biden supporters as well. Now the number swelled to 20.
Because the Biden campaign paid for 10 people but the last one took the money and never showed up.

Biden does have dementia. Many are concerned about him. My parents both had it before they died. I don‚Äôt resent anyone using the word. People generalize all the time like you saying Trump is a disaster. Dem mayors &amp; govs allowed their cities 2B destroyed, why? That‚Äôs a disaster!
Biden‚Äôs gonna get rid of mines. You sure you on the right side? Do you know how to program?
That‚Äôs not true young lady there are two candidates on the ticket for the presidency of the United States in 2020. Donald J Trump versus Donald J Trump. People will vote for or against Donald J Trump. Joe Biden won‚Äôt even be an afterthought.
May I remind you that it is Biden that said he would mandate a mask for all Americans on day 1? That sounds like the handmaid‚Äôs tale.
Anyone who wanted Bernie to win, wants Bernie's policies. If they don't vote for Biden, they're giving a vote to Trump,  who will destroy any chance of their fight for Bernie's policies... What. THEY. Wanted! They are more ignorant than the MAGA's. America is fucked!

This president has been far more transparent than any previous president in recent time. But, if you want those details, let's hear about Joe Biden's strokes that his wife referred to. And, remember Hilary on the campaign trail in 2016?
How is Trump going to spin this to make it Biden's fault? Taking bets!  #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCorona #Hypocrisy
Biden needs to keep campaigning. Biden needs to continue the negative ads. Trump is a psychopath, he will never change.
The debate needs to be done virtually. Pence has been exposed to Trump. Trump has already exposed Biden. We don't need Harris exposed too.
And here is why I am voting for Joe Biden.
There is no reason for Biden to suspend his campaign. Trump is fine.
I'm not bragging! I'm stating the fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a lot of Military Active and Retired voting for them. I am very Patriotic. I don't have to drive around in  a big truck with US flags to prove my Patriotism. It is in my heart and my brain.
That‚Äôs my story.
Fuck Republicans! They've been denying COVID19 since it hit America. They didn't follow the guidelines. Biden has followed guidelines &amp; should NOT stop campaigning.
Biden needs to keep campaigning.
Hell yes they would! Also, every never-trumper republican currently committed to voting for Biden WILL vote for 4 years of a Pence presidency in lieu of Biden.
Happy to do it!  Happy for Joe Biden and Jill!
Joe Biden tests negative for COVID-19    Thank Goodness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So did he not roast Biden for wearing a mask?
It would be kind of impressive if Trump owned Biden by killing him with his COVID. I think the writers are on to something.
They not only ignored it, they refused.  Donald Trump's family ignored mandatory mask rule at presidential debate with Joe Biden
I hope Joe Biden campaigns even harder, now. The ever clearer fact that no one is safe from Covid-19 makes his candidacy even more relevant and his election even more urgent.

It would have had more impact if Hunter Biden had been standing (sideways) next to her
Why is it Joe  Biden can run, ride a bike and not be winded? All King Drumpf can do is ride a golf cart and shuffle around a golf course. He can't even walk down a ramp without holding onto a General‚Äôs arm. Drumpf is a Lardbutt. Not my President. USAF RET!

PLEASE, next debate do not continuously interrupt the moderator for the next debate ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It looks so bad... No one cares about interrupting Biden (unless it‚Äôs literally every time he speaks), but interrupting the moderator IS NOT CLASSY AT ALL
As moderator, Wallace was responsible for the debate process, not Trump or Biden. Take responsibility, Mr Wallace.
You know what scares me? People hated Hillary. Biden does not have the unlikeability that Hillary had.
Trump asked Biden to denounce antifa, and he couldn't.  Keep it going

If Biden is a "mediocre" politician because he's made mistakes, lost elections, &amp; learned from both w/o losing his soul I'll take a mediocre pol over shape-shifting oily operators Romney, Gingrich, Cruz, DeSantis ANY DAY. Maybe a *meh* politician = sincere public servant. #HRC

Agreed. To vote for Joe Biden.  And, also, preferably, to go back in time, stop being a poopy pants and vote for Hillary Diane Clinton.
Chris Wallace was asking leading questions to set him off his plan.  like charlottesville, did he ask Biden when you said if you dont vote for me you ain't black? and it kinda worked, Trump was going to let Biden hang himself.

Not knowing Biden quoted 45's own FBI director isn't a point, dumb I mean I get that the orange shitstain is willfully ignorant but what's your excuse?
The Low moments were contributed by Donald Trump and Chris Wallace did not do a good job of controlling Trump's interruptions and rudeness.  Joe Biden was trying to tell what he would do, Trump didn't like him telling the truth, and interrupted him.  Joe was good, Trump was lying
Maybe some will vote for Biden, but the main supporters will not change their minds because they don't want to listen and know the truth.
In all fairness Biden didn't condemn the violent Antifa group directly either, and Biden ALSO used ad hominem attacks. I get where you're coming from, but they're both wrong. IMO, Antifa &amp; Far right groups are fascist by using violence to assert their ideas. both are terrible.

Biden shouldn't have had to ask anyone to do that!  It was up to Wallace to do the controlling, not back off!  He failed as Moderator Big time!  Trump acted like the Buffoon he is.  His Lies will be remembered and we will Vote accordingly in November Megyn!

Trump came in first,  Wallace came in second and Biden came in third place in the debate tonight.
Watching Trump interrupt, cut off Joe Biden and seeing just how lacking this Moderator is in his duties to hold back Trump from his disrespect.  Joe is telling what he will do and what we need and Trump is demeaning &amp; behaving like a Buffoon.
Why was the President not advised to take notes on points he wants to dispute while Biden talks so he does not have to continually interrupt?

these reporters need their ears checked.. she says it clear as day,  said it multiple times! He does not agree! However call out Biden who says ANTIFA is an idea! lol

Biden said in the debate he had a plan to save lives but also shutting down the country.. Ok, if you sir have a plan let's here it.. Why wait save lives now..  And shutting down the country more then the 4 months it was shut down we cause us more harm.

You're dead wrong. Biden is the right candidate for THIS moment. People need to see someone call trump a "liar" and a "clown" snd "the worst president ever" to his face. Loved it when Joe told him to "shut up, man".
How can you vote Biden?  Serious question?
Yeah, Biden stayed silent. Lol
I mean Biden only saying it once is a testament to his restraint tbh
I was more pissed about Biden saying President Trump needed to get off the golf course or sand trap - beyond rude &amp; so untrue!
While Biden avoided answering questions
Gotta hand it to the Biden handlers - they did a great end around by having Wallace frame the questions so President Trump was on the defensive with his answers instead of highlighting his accomplishments. Wonder how much Wallace was compensated?
Jenna, they need to make a commercial with these comments &amp; point out how unpresidential &amp; disrespectful Biden is!
The way Chris Wallace framed the questions it was nearly impossible to pivot to successes - Trump was on the defensive trying to respond &amp; counter Biden's snarkiness...

He‚Äôs named them a terrorist group and  put up 500 billion to create 3 million new jobs for the black community, he wasn‚Äôt able to finish questions cause of Wallace, Biden couldn‚Äôt finish one question lol and if he did it didn‚Äôt make sense

Trump won that debate but in a disrespectful way I‚Äôd say. He definitely talked over Biden way to much and wasn‚Äôt punished for it. Wasn‚Äôt very fair
Clearer than ever that Chris Wallace is a Trump hater hell-bent on helping Biden. And why did Biden keep looking down  his podium? What was he looking

What I really hate to see on both sides though is this very ego-fueling desire to never be wrong. Biden is NOT perfect and has made mistakes, and he (as well as EVERY candidate) should acknowledge that and promise to be better.
Biden shouldn't have agreed to debate the bullying lying pos on that stage. Biden isn't showing enough passion &amp; even anger.  Why not attack him? At a minimum stop letting him lie &amp; characterize Dems as violent radical leftists burning cities &amp; destroying US. Red meat Fight back!
He keeps trying to get Biden to say law and order. Biden doesn‚Äôt think about law and order which is looney tunes
Bull shit.. How was it his fault? As soon as covid came over he closed down the country, after 3 months of closure left it up to each state..  I fear if Biden wins
Does Biden know that antifa is an organization not just an idea?
Biden is not fit to lead!  He‚Äôs a puppet.

Maybe there will be some material declassed that doesn't make it to public eye that Trump can drop on Biden tonight live in front of the world.
That is not entirely true. Joe Biden created very high paying jobs for his Brother and Hunter.
ü§î Misleading:  "Joe biden wants to raise taxes on poor Americans!!"  Not misleading:  "Joe biden wants to raise taxes on people earning over $400,000 a year!"  Misleading part: "Poor Americans" misleads you to believe that someone earning $40,000/yr will get their taxes raised

Twisted logic? Biden isn't hiding anything. trump is the only major candidate in 5 decades to not release his tax returns. trump is fighting giving his DNA in a rape case. If he's innocent, it would prove it. You trumpophiles don't even know what logic is.
Yeah, we‚Äôre patriots &amp; we‚Äôre voting for Biden
Will you guys shut up! I‚Äôm a gun owner. Biden is not taking anyone‚Äôs gunsAre you fucking kidding me? Would Trump postpone if Biden was sick. Hell no. GFYS
40 homes in our community - three of us have Biden and Kelly signs....
So too therefore, Shouldn‚Äôt we have all of Biden‚Äôs health records too! Start calling for Biden to be tested for dementia. You have influence..
Bernie is campaigning for Biden HARD this weekend, has a ton of rallies scheduled. Biden is more of a "behind the scenes" candidate, wish he'd transition to being more visible.
And when your done, think of the more than 300k that died waiting to be seen by the VA while Biden was VP.
I want trump to get well so he can face justice after Biden wins the election.
As opposed to l Biden who was mentored by a grand wizard, pushed for segregation, and only significant bill in 47 years  locked up minorities for too long to make sure the ‚Äúpredators‚Äù didn‚Äôt create a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù? GTFO üòÇ
The problem is Biden &amp; the Democratic Party are just fine with this Justice pick. Republicans win &amp; Democrats don‚Äôt have to do anything about it. They can just blame Trump &amp; the Republicans while they spend the next 50 yrs fighting social justice wars all over again.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely.
Sorry.. voting Blue kills us ALL!  You don't let an OLD man, like Biden, who has DEMENTIA have his finger on the nuclear button!
Biden won the last debate though
I will vote Biden
"You should be more curious about Biden/Harris‚Äôs refusal to answer basic policy questions that will change this country forever"
It seems so probable that "Pompeo" and "pompous" come from the same root word, but I haven't found any verification of that.  Then again, it's interesting that the DNC is "Biden' its time" until its own version of Konstantin Chernenko drifts away and  Kamala takes over.  Names...
Bloomberg hoping Trump is "unable to govern" because of Covid, while wanting Biden elected, a man with DEMENTIA, who is unable to govern.  It's comical.
It‚Äôs easier to make voting change the system when we don‚Äôt have someone in charge who is actively trying to destroy our democracy. The plan should be to get trump out and bully Biden to the left.
I am voting for Biden and we will have humanity back! Its going to happen. üíô
Biden reminds me of an 80 yr old man trying to look young. The jog from behind the poster is a nice touch!
Before you fill your ballot out, think about how Trump lied about the dangers of this virus from the very beginning. Mocking others like Joe Biden for wearing masks.  Holding maskless rallies and W.H. events has endangered members of the GOP. #VoteHimOut2020
Every day we talk to hundreds of voters, and one thing is clear: we need elected leaders like Mark kelly and Joe Biden. In Arizona, there are 2 days left to register to vote, and voting begins in 4 days
Same here in AZ, we're afraid to see what would happen if we put out Biden signs. Several Trump signs on our street.
We were driving around Paradise Valley in AZ ( wealthiest in AZ) and 4 Biden signs for every dump signüá∫üá∏üëèüèΩ
Yes, Biden should run all his ads. Trump is running some of the biggest lie ads I've ever seen, here in AZ. I feel like we should kick his despicable ass while he's down.
Who knows maybe he‚Äôll make another Joe Biden blunders and really vote for Trump üòÇ
Just an opinion so I don't want people to take my tweets to serious. We would have to be there to know what is really going on but it just seems odd that's all. He usually is spouting out something nasty about Biden or Obama. So I will just continue to watch the news for updates.
At least Biden supporters are practicing social distancing unlike the supporters of the other guy...
I will respect your commitment to health &amp; making good flicks. Your Biden choice is unsettling &amp; I believe you are thinking about which side of the bread is buttered for you. Congratulations you have lost a lowly deplorable as a fan.
In other words lets wait and see if Biden wins the election cause if he does then all of this will get swept back under the rug.
Joe Biden Campaign Scrambles to Adjust to New Uncertainty in Race  via
Biden and his Wife tested negative for covid. Trump and his wife didn‚Äôt. So Trump is at a hospital with covid and his wife is home with hers. Sad
Neither is Biden unfortunately. All we can do is wait. Negative test results so close to possible exposure aren‚Äôt really diagnostic. He needs to be retested and if a week, 2 weeks from debate night he‚Äôs still negative then he‚Äôs probably ok. Pins and needles until then.
‚Ä¶and I'm demanding that Trump remove his negative ads about Biden
Are you serious?!! That is just about the most selfless act ever. God bless Joe Biden. #VoteBiden
Sorry America, I can't make the entire video more serious, because to me Joe Biden is a joke, and his refusal to answer questions because that answer will become an issue or a headline is a cop out. He's a coward and RED CHINA is using him as a PAWN in their plan to dominate us
I can do this too. A high level DEM source told me Joe Biden is stopping  his campaign because his mental capacity has become a serious concern.
This is the British Prime Minister wishing President Trump a speedy recovery. Notice the signs on the backhoe and his hard hat then notice the Biden Harris slogan. I wonder. Of course I believe that dark hill behind him is a pile of cow manure so there is that!!!
They weren't strokes, they were aneurysms.
No one from the Biden campaign should agree to be in the same room with a single person from the Trump campaign. They lie about everything. It isn‚Äôt safe.
You are blaming COVID on Trump?  Trump stopped travel from China is January and was called a "Xenophobe" by you leftists, Pelosi and Biden.  What say you about Pelosi inviting people in her district to parade in Feb?
Learn to read. It's going get worse when Biden is elected because the thugs are gonna be mad. Got it?
#Biden vs #Biden. Which side wins?
Imagine if we had an honest media.
Also, go look up some of the stuff Biden has said about people of color. You'll be mindblown
So vote Biden and Co in so we can enjoy more months of lockdowns and also socialism.

Why is every Chris Hayes story anti-Trump. Has there been ONE anti-Biden take? Hm.
I mean, Biden‚Äôs makeup was fantastic.
Yeah Biden evolved after he benefitted. Please don‚Äôt try selling that pig in a poke. It makes you look uneducated.
I think Biden is familiar with Laura Mercier.
And rump made fun of Biden for keeping a far distance.
Joe Biden said he decided to run when President Trump said inside both groups there's good people.  And if Joe doesn't understand what the President meant by that he doesn't qualify to take my order at McDonald's.
Immediately,  I want Biden impeached for all his notorious crimes.  But then Kamala would have the presidency.
25% have moved to Biden the terrorist!  I pray for it too it looks very grim now
Fact check: Trump campaign runs Facebook ads featuring fake image of Biden wearing earpiece  #SmartNews
Biden seems to observe the basic precautions about spreading the virus.
Well, because that's exactly what Biden wants to do and he's said it. Bernie Sanders has his hand up Joe Biden's rectum that he's telling him what to say and directing all of his movements.
If Biden wins, he may make us. That's who DemonCraps are.
How is Pence Not sick? I‚Äôm so worried about Biden!
Biden‚Äôs team should come back with updated ads that show Trump‚Äôs reckless behavior &amp; then his trip to the hospital. Trump can‚Äôt be trusted.
I‚Äôm in Arizona and negative ads against Biden/Harris are running full steam ahead.
Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt be reacting to Trump news. Biden and the Dems need to focus on their own race. As far as ads go, if they are true and accurate, why take them down?
The Biden‚Äôs are almost to the White House!!!üòÑüòÑüëçüòõ
Unless you know something that FBI Director Wray does not, Antifa, which stands for anti fascism, is an ideology, not an organization.   However, Biden, Harris, Schumer, &amp; Pelosi have repeatedly issued public statements condemning violence/violent protest of any kind by anyone.
Are you really tweeting about arthritis right now after failing to enforce safety rules at the last debate that have now placed Joe Biden and his supporters at risk of COVID exposure.
Lol. Ughhhh Biden‚Äôs up from all accounts.

It was Christie's strategy to scream over Biden while he was trying to speak. If you've ever heard him address the people of New Jersey, it's totally believable.
I guess Fox only wants Biden to suspend campaign.
I am a lifelong Dem and supporter of Biden, but I don‚Äôt know how we can complain about Qanon and then tweet something like this from ‚Äúa GOP source.‚Äù It‚Äôs irresponsible, IMHO.
With that being the case? Why isn‚Äôt Biden under lockdown quarantine rather then out in public doing appearances.
Way to stay classy, Mr. Biden!!üëèüèª
Every day we talk to hundreds of voters, and one thing is clear: we need elected leaders like Mark kelly and Joe Biden. In Arizona, there are 2 days left to register to vote, and voting begins in 4 days.
The Republicans will be too busy jamming Corey Barrett on to the supreme court before they are defeated bigly Nov. 3.  So much for democracy.  Biden will have a tough time repairing the damage that has been done in the past four years.
Okay I didn‚Äôt think about it that way, I was thinking that he is not going to be able to do rally‚Äôs and stuff unlike Biden but I forgot technology runs 2020.
Trump was TRYING to get Biden infected at the Debate.  He KNEW he had Covid, so he arrived late so he couldn‚Äôt be tested.  So he could infect Biden.  Unacceptable.  #VeteransForTrump #EvangelicalsForTrump #WomenForTrump #ChristiansForTrump #LatinosForTrump #Texas #Florida #Iowa
If Biden is elected, Bernie will be in charge of healthcare.  I don‚Äôt like Biden.  I do like Bernie. I‚Äôll #SettleForBiden
I'm so upset about the Commission on Presidential Debates not holding Trump to the agreed upon rules! It's unconscionable they failed to test him prior to the debate, endangering Biden, bc DT &amp; his clan arrived late &amp; then they didn't enforce the mask mandate for Trump's side!?!?
That just seems like peak 2020.  Pence takes over, the RNc announces that Trump‚Äôs electors will back Pence, and independents decide to vote for him over Biden because at least Pence isn‚Äôt senile...
Now Nancy  Pelosi Joe Biden  stop measuring the president for his coffin!  He is tweeting from the hospital ! So shut it!
Biden has dementia. Press: *crickets"  Trump gets the China virus. Press wants to perform a colonoscopy on him.
Remember that time when Donald Trump was making fun of Joe Biden for wearing a mask a couple days ago
Whatever position I take will become the issue - Joe Biden. LMAO!! Well Joe that's how people learn what you think and what you stand for or turn into a limp noodle over
And if he does did you go to jail simple as that far as I'm concerned him and his family to be arrested for attempted murder on Biden

Tbh I still think Hillary lost more than Trump won. I don‚Äôt think Biden has that same hate but who knows
You mean the leadership that supplied NYC with everything they asked for but didn‚Äôt need? The leadership failures belong to the individual governors...Trump oversaw preparations based on the information in real time...As compared to Biden‚Äôs SARS and MRSA leadership disasters
Gosh I hope so. My friends and I have been diligently working on GOTv efforts and putting up AZ Republicans For Biden signs in our area only to have them stolen and defaced repeatedly. Aggravating.
Trump Covid-19 diagnosis scrambles Arizona events; Biden may still visit
How much do you want to bet that the Trump administration knew Trump was infected with the vrius before the debate and decided that if Trump already had it, might as well infect Biden with it as well. Cuz you know thats how Trump's brain works
What in the bloody hell is going on in Victoria? Total police state!  This is what's in store forüá∫üá∏ if the deep state is allowed to steal the election for the globalists. Trump's not running against Biden/Harris.
Biden‚Äôs events are always safe &amp; public health oriented. It‚Äôs the irresponsible Trump/Pence/Ducey rallies to worry about. GOP events are dangerous - few masks &amp; little social distancing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go away soon, like a miracle.‚Äù
Biden/Harris needs to drives the nails into his coffin ‚ö∞Ô∏è and end it now.
#2020 Victory has a cold-calling campaign where they mislead people and the shove Biden down your throat. there has to be something illegal with that
NYT Cohen ‚ÄúLincoln lesson‚Äù: ‚ÄúThe essence of American idea is unity ...‚ÄùWith malice toward none; with charity for all.‚Äù Trump has done opposite. Biden is UNIFIER.

Mark Kelly, Hunter Biden and the Chinese Communist Party's Influence | Opinion
Arizona was key to Trump‚Äôs electoral college win in 2016. The president and his surrogates have been spending a lot of time here in this election cycle to try and prevent Arizona from slipping away to his opponent former Vice President Biden.

And the US blames Trump for something that was beyond his control. Biden says he would handle it better...well hindsight is 50/50. My vote is with the man that has built our nation's economy back up after Obama/Biden failed.
These people have no scruples, they would absolutely lie under oath. Frankly who gives a damn? Either biden wins or we're fucked. We can return to this distracting bs after the election.
Let‚Äôs do this! Stay safe and well Vice President / soon to be President Biden!
The pot calling the kettle black. Biden is the one who needs to denounce white supremacy.

Bro you are so far up Biden‚Äôs ass, no republican has ever said covid wasn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs just not a dangerous disease, masks won‚Äôt do anything and there is no reason to shut down the economy or the country
would you believe me if I told you that I just got quite literally trapped in a 5 mile long Trump truck parade down the freeway (?) in my little hyundai elantra with a rainbow Biden sticker on my bumper.... you can imagine the gestures that were thrown my way!! This week dude...
Ok Biden you get my vote
This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.
And debated and could have potentially harmed Biden, biological warefare! TERRORIST!

Yea. You mean Biden.
I would not doubt that Trump tried to infect Joe Biden and his wife. Combined with his sense of invulnerability it seems entirely possible.
Let‚Äôs keep talking about Biden. He who shall not be named is soaking up the publicity.
This tells me Trump and possibly his family had it on Tuesday night, they refuse to wear masks, and they spread it to other people even possibly Joe Biden.
Trump wouldn't pause for a second if Biden were ill.
I've made jokes about Biden and dementia, don't get me wrong but I'm careful since it runs in my family. But yeah, I don't want anyone to die. I just try to be a good person, and go from there. I hope as a society we can get back to that you know?
Joe Biden has taken those CDC changes, incorporated them into his public behavior, and led people thru example. The hallmark of an effective leader.  Trump sneers at masks, in turn, encouraging his knuckle-dragging base to mimic his poor behavior. The hallmark of a shitty leader.
The Trump campaign said Friday that planned events in Arizona next week will be held virtually or postponed; Democratic challenger Joe Biden is expected to be in Arizona on Oct. 8. #phoenix‚Äã
For people who misreported.  For example the Trump Russia hoax which actually was the  Clinton/Biden Russia crimes that is just starting to come out
He is hated so vehemently by the left because he is slowly but surely exposing their unprecedented corruption - from Obama's weaponizing the FBI/DOJ to Biden's family raking in millions (even $1.5b in once case) from Russian/Ukraine/China leaders.
Biden voters literally have a mental disease

That one woman by the way was a Hillary person. Not Biden or Obama
That‚Äôs what class looks like Mr. Trump. Take notes now or from your hotel when Biden moves into the White House but please take notes!!
It‚Äôs not paranoia when no 1 can get their story straight. not even the doctors.  He still got Biden to remove his adds, gets to skip the debates, gets to avoid malaria‚Äôs hate recording AND can say it‚Äôs not bad.I REALLY hope I‚Äôm wrong. I would be much happier if he actually has it
Plague?? I thought it was no big deal just the flu? Remember he made fun of Biden for wearing a mask lol.
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
And if Biden is planning any big gatherings in Arizona, he should be told the same thing.
Biden isn‚Äôt Hillary
Karma for going after Biden‚Äôs stutter. Hopefully you‚Äôll suffer
Hi Dr. Biden, please implore Joe to put all of his ads, including the negative ads, back up and in rotation. All guns blazing. For the love of God and country.
Lol, get serious. Trump has been campaigning for four years. Biden has three years to go to catch up. Hypocrisy rules Republicans!
If the #publicoption were imposed on the #American public, everyone could lose their private healthcare plans. #MarkKellyforSenate
And didn't have the common courtesy to inform the Biden campaign despite being in close contact with them just a few short hours prior to his diagnosis.
The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Yah thats no issue. If Trump were to die Nov 4, then Pence just becomes the most lame duck lame duck of all time and keeps the seat warm until Biden.  The nightmare is if Trump dies before Nov 3 and somehow still wins. Then what?
Biden should put his negative ads back up, for the simple reason. Trump would do the same.
President Trump has done more in four years then Joe Biden did in 47! Biden is just like every other politician, a liar and a crook!Trump for President AGAIN!!!
Vice President Pence will campaign in Arizona on Thursday, the day after the VP debate with Sen. Harris.   Biden and Harris will also be campaigning in Arizona on Thursday.
I think your anti-Trump paranoia is getting to you. How do you explain the 23 other people who also tested positive following the Rose Garden ceremony? And Biden didn't remove ALL his ads, only the negative ones.
#TrumpIsKillingUS Biden needs to keep ads airing AND media needs to get mad like Van Jones did after debate. Nice doesn‚Äôt work against this administration of small pox blanket givers. Get Mad. Enuf with nice. I‚Äôm MAD. GET MAD. #TrumpIsATraitor

Richard Spencer Reiterates Support for Biden, Disavows 'Useless' and 'Traitorous' GOP  #DNCPolicies
Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
When you don‚Äôt adhere to the science this is what can happen. I guess Biden spending time in his basement wasn‚Äôt such a bad idea after all!
This whole thing was made up so he can get away with not doing anymore debates, get off the topic of malanias hate recordings, and come out in 2 weeks and say the virus is nothing to worry about. And he got Biden to remove all his adds. You‚Äôre right I think it‚Äôs BS.
That liar biden denies that what he is saying in this video. And people want to vote for this socialist untruthful damn fool.
(2) If Biden and DEMs admitted what Trump actually said and didn't make a major ongoing project of maliciously twisting it, but simply said they doubt Trump's sincerity in saying it, I could respect that.  That's NOT what they're doing.  This is about THEIR level of integrity.
We need to elect a vigorous, healthy person as President of the United States. Compare Joe Biden on his bike with the overweight (6 ft, 244 pounds) Donald Trump riding his Golf cart. That's especially true after his Covid19 diagnosis
Trump/Pence have worked harder on behalf of the American people that Obama/Biden ever did. They were too busy corrupting America‚Äôs institutions and enriching themselves.
After biden first said he wants the green new deal then he said he hated it and would never put it in place, yes, he did in fact lose the radical left...
Politics has taken over my life the past few months. It's been great and I can't wait for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to take their place in the White House, but...  I MISS HAVING A SOCIAL LIFE!!! üíÉ
Why does the media continue to cover Trump‚Äôs condition when all they can say is that they have no information? Please cover Biden all day and cut in with breaking news if they release anything concrete!  Dear Lord! How many times can they say they don‚Äôt know?
Literally you post an article about what Trump's company was accused of doing in 1973 when his father was still running it, and count that as more relevant than a smoking-gun video to a claim that DEMs are distorting Trump's words.  Almost as far back as Biden fighting Corn Pop!
They announced he tested positive as soon as they received the results. Biden was in bed.
The Lincoln Project Releases the Pro Biden ad ‚ÄúHeartland‚Äù
Biden aides suspect that Trump had already contracted the virus by the time of Tuesday‚Äôs debate &amp; they are angry that members of Mr. Trump‚Äôs family refused to wear masks in the debate hall, and rebuffed the efforts of an employee of the CC to wear one.
If they had any self-respect, they‚Äôd go public, rescind their donations and re-direct them to Biden.
Actually, Biden had it and gave it to Trump.
True even if Biden wins.
If by dying in this hospital bed, then yes you are correct. Joe Biden has never done that
Whoa: Did Joe Biden Falsely Smear the Truck Driver Involved in the Car Crash That Killed His First Wife and Daughter?
Reading all those left uninformed people really makes me cringe.  They have no clue what they want.  If Joe told them to go jump off a cliff they would.  Reading their comments saying Biden will/would do better is funny and scary because they actually believe the lies. #TRUMP2020
This January 20th, Joe Biden is going to be the 47th President, not the 46th.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
Even IF you were making a persuasive, objective argument that Trump has always been a racist (you aren't), you're still flagrantly moving goalposts on this. The issue is DEMs all the way up to Biden systematically, maliciously misrepresenting what Trump SAID; the video proves it.
‚ÄúStimulus‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt this just because they want adoring crowds? Then again, in my north-central-Phoenix neighborhood, Biden signs outnumber Trump signs 4 to 1.
Just like the Trump camp continues their Biden bashing with their commercials
Even if your Gish Gallop of unproven claims here proved Trump is a "RACIST", it is beside the point that DEMs all the way up to Biden are LYING about what Trump SAID. BTW, Trump "attacks" a lot of people of any color/gender; why not  too if he just hates black women?
(2) Again, my point was about the wholesale malicious distortion of what Trump SAID, going all the way up to Biden himself. If you want to ADMIT what he said but doubt he meant it, that's one thing. Repeatedly and deliberately distorting what he DID say is inexcusable.  Period.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
Basement Biden is fine and will be in great health to lose this election. #Trump2020
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden is a much better man! A man of empathy is what this country needs to help us heal!!! I‚Äôm so proud to be voting for
Oh my blood pressure went way up when I read this but the best part is Biden never faltered
Wow, just wow!  31 days until President-elect Biden is all can say to this.
You‚Äôre in for a really rough year buddy everything and believe is incorrect.  HRC &amp; Biden we‚Äôre in cahoots with Russia and, much worse, China.  It will all be exposed soon. #Trump2020
They are speaking the truth though. You know you'd be dancing on Biden's grave, we all know that.
This should highlight the main difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  States should be able to decide what is best for them.
He's on oxygen and he's exhausted he can't breathe somebody yesterday a doctor on here said that when you're winded you can't even hold up a phone they're lying I think he has a virus days before they said he did and he tried to infect Biden at the debate
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, didn't notify Biden (whom he shared an indoor debate stage with on Tuesday night), and continued onto a fundraiser and rally in Minnesota. On Thursday, he started an antibody therapy and went to a fundraiser in New Jersey.

Tough call, although I‚Äôve seen no fewer than three Republicans for Biden signs in Laura‚Äôs neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want us to get complacent
Did Chris Wallace wear a mask. No!!! Did he get a Covid 19 test before the debate. NO he arrived too late. You say " Follow The Science" Take your own damn advice Chris Biden I mean Wallace.
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
üëÄ Buried in the middle of this article: An Arizona NYT/Siena (A+) poll is underway. Friday polling (after Trump‚Äôs positive Covid disclosure) was beneficial to Biden. This will be a good nonpartisan quality poll result just before AZ ballots mailed on Wed.
Trump and his administration will effect everyone as long as he stays in power, we must vote him out and remove GOP too, vote vote biden harris
What would you know about unity? ‚ÄúDivide and conquer‚Äù were your words. As general Mattis pointed out, they were also the words used by the Nazis. Admit it: if Trump had given Covid to Joe Biden you‚Äôd be asking Biden to pull out of the race.
The Chauncey Gardner candidate.
Political gangbanging is all around Arizona right now lol one side of the street banging Biden the other side is banging Trump ü§£ü§£ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Love you Joe Biden!  Go get em!
AND he was most dangerous as a spreader of COVID on TUESDAY. He figured he'd take a shot at killing Biden.
Paula-confusion the norm for Trump White House. Why would we expect something different? Looking üëÄforward to calm, truthful leadership w Biden admin. Sick of chaos/lies ü§¢.
We need a video on this..promptly!.No Mr.Nice Guy!!.he HOPED he could get Biden sick. DONT honor the devil.
And the Trumps arrived late to the debate and did not get tested. There wasn‚Äôt enough time. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that it was not purposeful. Prating the Biden‚Äôs are safe. Trump didn‚Äôt even call Biden to tell him he was positive!üò°üò°üò°
Honestly you are an idiot.  The President, your friend is in the hospital, possibly far sicker than his docs or the White House admits and you are tweeting about what wussies the Biden teams is.  The country is worried about the leader of the free world.  You?  Debates.
I'm just confused why he hasn't been indicted already on the 205,000 dead but yes this was premeditated and it was against Biden that should be capital murder land it conspiracies about it
Dr. Biden was there, too. Can you imagine endangering not only  but  after their family has already lost so much? Just pure evil.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
Remember that midnight flight him in the wifey took maybe they got some blood transfusions or something to keep them going so they could infect the debate that's all I can think of they wanted to get Biden sick
Yes! Please look! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
Womp womp womp! When you have no legitimate argument, attack with analysis of the choice of words. Your boy Biden never gets the words right though you know what he ‚Äúmeans‚Äù right? Fine, he put his life of the line for the freedom of you and me...complete strangers!
And it would have tried to infect Biden again or Harris or any of us
Can‚Äôt think you would like to live in a government socialist country. With Biden and especially Harris you will be doing that.
He tried to kill Joe Biden.
Even Joe Biden at the debate, said a quick PRAYER to Trump, and Joe didn't know at 1st, hehehe. Take look at the paused 54th minute (My energy orientation is Right to Left= 54...45)  Joe uses a hand gesture known as the 221 Factor to symbolize God  Take a look &amp; see for yourself
No, Trump and the Radical Right are  trying to pull a fast one. The Radical Right won't have enough votes to put it through. With all the GOP senators (and more to come) becoming ill, no vote will take place until Pres Biden takes office and the Dems rule.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
I watched and it was Biden who interrupted 1st.
Trump himself was a biological weapon against Biden. Sick.
Trump purposely arrived "too late for covid19 check" and exposed many people including Biden etc
Because he is an Ardent Biden supporter and if you watch him he doesn't even pretend to remain neutral he is as biased as they come. Everyone knew he wouldn't be fair. Trump has to interrupt to point out all of the lies being spit out.
All my prayers go to the families for dealing with that one extra or maybe two extra seats at their table when Biden said that I burst into tears girl it's the worst feeling ever and me and you know how it feels how could they not
We will never know if and when Biden gets the virus since he‚Äôs permanently quarantined in his bunkers..we may have to trust his handlers - NOT!
Your husband mocked Biden‚Äôs son who has an addiction.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
I'd say that accusing Trump of attempted murder is just a little strong. Trump isn't that smart. Gross negligence, I can buy -- but a deliberate, specific attempt to kill Joe Biden? Dramatic much?
You know didn't we say that that Biden should stay safe and they use the Honor Code system at the debate Are you seriously kidding me and they purposely took their masks off to try to infect Biden
Because lockdowns just don‚Äôt work.  But that doesn‚Äôt stop Biden ‚Äú...I‚Äôll shutdown the country.‚Äù
Proof Alinski Marxist Democrat Operative Chris Wallace is promulgating fake news to help Biden during the debate
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely. More by
Oh, but we WILL vote for Biden!!
I‚Äôm just gonna say it: Biden needs to seriously consider quarantining himself. He‚Äôs done everything right so far; this is not the time for him to not follow public health guidelines.
He was positive Wednesday morning, yet never reached out to the Biden campaign to inform them. They were informed at the same time the rest of the world was: late Thursday night. He is a psychopath
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump knowingly exposed people to a deadly virus. In Minnesota and New Jersey. Biden better up the negative ads. Immediately.
Trump Vs Biden Debate, Our Thoughts  via  #WalkAway #VoteRed #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
Honestly ,I feel like this is a play to first try and get rid of the president and Vice president which would immediately put Fancy Nancy as Acting President which open doors for Biden to win then after the first year Biden resigns ,which makes Kamala President and Nancy VPü§îü§îü§î
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
Bigly. Why should Biden stop his campaign? Trump did this to himself  &amp; literally infected people himself. He knew in Jan and Thursday morn.209k people are dead. He is a murderer. Whatever Joe Biden does, he will be doing it with a mask on. #TrumpHasCovid #VetsAgainstTrump
The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76.3 years and 81.1 years for females. Pelosi - 80 Bernie - 79 Biden - 77 Trump - 74  Why are we still voting people in that are likely to die soon?
Biden lies everyday and Boone calls him out. I love the light that he attended the black college. Did you see the people looking at each other like yeah sure!
No Biden shouldn‚Äôt cancel anything.trump would be making fun of him just like he did Hillary.
JUST IN: VP Mike Pence is returning to the Valley next week to host a campaign rally, on the same day former VP Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris will be here.  #abc15 #election2020

CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Cuts Interview With Trump Spokesman After He Brings Up Biden‚Äôs Record On Racial Issues
My understanding is that Trump and Biden were supposed to be tested before the debate. But, Trump arrived late and he was not tested before the debate!!!
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
In Arizona, countless elected officials wished President Trump a speedy recovery Friday. The president‚Äôs campaign announced changes to his planned visits to the state next week. And some grumbled about the lack of safeguards at previous Trump rallies.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
Also promoting that Biden will win according to stocks buys and the GOP will lose the Senate. Resulting in higher taxes and much more regulation which will upset everything but that‚Äôs ok because it will all calm down in the long run. Geez.
#newsmax Quite a bit has been written about #chriswallace and his obvious anti-Trump bias exhibited during the Trump-Biden debate. But I haven't seen anything written about this exchange: Wallace asked #potus45 if he was willing to "condemn . . militia groups". &gt; &gt; &gt;
Of course he would.   He‚Äôs celebrated when Hillary Clinton had pneumonia. Vice President Biden has taken the highroad. If the situation were flipped there‚Äôs no road too low for Trump!!!
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Have you actually followed the policies he‚Äôs supported? He‚Äôs a terrible speaker and no clue how to use tone, but we all watched Biden blatantly lie and exaggerate to us during the debate over and over... but his tone of voice was consoling.
ü§£ Biden supporters are literally the scum of this planet.
Biden/Harris are visiting AZ this week sooooo this seems like a poorly planned attack
Nancy Pelosi  Chuck Schumer  Biden Muslim Brothers stop spreading lies fake rumors  all foreign countries except for  Iran wished  him wellness  .
No notice to Biden. WH  is one sick group
Do you want humanity back? Work to get Joe Biden elected president. Maybe we can restore some of it.
I don't care about Trump. What was Biden's test result today??
Wallace promulgated false statements &amp; debunked fake news as fact, then stepped in to debate Trump on his false premise stories. He should have joined Biden, at his podium. Wallace exposes the disguise of previously fair &amp; balanced Fox News, now just more scripted leftist MSM.
Only of Tulsi, unfortunately.  Biden could almost literally eat babies for breakfast and be OK in their book just for Not Being Trump.
Trump knew he had it. He was hoping that Biden would get it. Evil at its best.
Hey Arizona ‚Äújournalists‚Äù, ask Mark Kelly about his position on guns and Biden‚Äôs tax hikes, in between sessions of rooting for our President to die, of course.  Just a thought. #DoYourJob
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I am hoping President Biden does not go down the path of "leaning forward. Must heal the Nation." I agree with you. Put in place the team, investigate and prosecute all of those who broke the law.
AgreeüíØüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ. #BidenHarris need to keep moving FULL SPEED AHEAD! Stop being nice &amp; keep moving! tRUMp &amp; his people would taking advantage if it were #Biden that had #COVID19!
I just read an article the whole family at the debate refuse to follow any guidelines except Melania find that very interesting dot-dot. I truly believe they were trying to give Biden the virus on purpose
Is he voting for Biden?
You seem a little angry there that I was able to so easily knock down the ‚ÄúJoe Biden gave the eulogy of the head of the KKK‚Äù lie.   A person should not be judged on what they once did but on what they currently consistently do and say.  has ALWAYS been a racist
1.  It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, it‚Äôs the Constitution, meaning 2.  Biden doesn‚Äôt have any power to delay the election, so 3.  Being a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù has nothing to do with anything.  If the situation was reversed, no way tRump delays the election.  He won‚Äôt even stop negative ads.
Superspreader update: Christy joins the club  Trump Melania Hope Hicks Kellyanne Conway Ronna McDaniel Bill Stepien Father John Jenkins Sen. Tom Tillis Sen. Mike Lee 3 white house press  Chris Christie Rudy Giuliani? Bill Barr?  Members of Biden circle:  NOBODY.
The #BidenHarris ticket need to STOP being NICE! That camp needs to keep doing what they‚Äôve been doing! Keep Moving!! tRuMp &amp; his people would have been RUTHLESS had it been #Biden getting #COVID19.
BIDEN WINS ELECTION!
Democrats are liars and cheaters so naturally you would think that because all you have to compare it to is the most dishonest of human beings. I love all the polls about Biden being aheadü§£ just like killary was in 2016 right. DJT will be your president until 2024. ü§£ü§£ü§£
If Biden wins Florida, it‚Äôs done,
Biden oversaw the longest stretch of job growth in American history. Obama/Biden added more NEW jobs in their last 3 years than Trump did in his first 3. Then he crashed the economy and will leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. Get your facts straight.
Biden &amp; Harris also in Arizona on Thursday
No doubt, Trump would ridicule Biden as weak, just as he did Hillary Clinton, when she had pneumonia.
You coached Trump to scream at Joe Biden to rattle him. It didn‚Äôt work. #Karma
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
You really are not top of the gene pool with tweets like this. Did Trump also create the COVID cocktail in China and spread it to the world? He acted quicker than the WHO who told him not to overreact and shut down flights. As you Biden would say, c‚Äômon, man!
I often wonder where these people will go after 2020.   Trump won't hire them if he wins. Neither will Biden.   Are they hoping to wait for another GOP president in 2024 who might hire them, or are they done with Gov't service and are just YOLO-ing?
BIDEN SAID HE WILL FUND HAMAS!! BIDEN SAID NO MORE FUNDING TO EGYPT !! BBIDRN SAID HE WILL RAISE TAXES ! THINK WGEN GE FUNDS HAMAS HE IS PLANNING TO HO BACK TO ME TO KILL FOR #NWO HE HAS TO DEPOPULATE!
He is an orange treason weasel who somehow got COVID.
I could link a lot to you that would conflict with your conclusion, including his work with (and $ support for) Jesse Jackson.  But you aren't even interested in the evidence I've already offered, refuting a MAJOR Biden/DEM accusation about  Trump's "very fine people" statement.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering
Biden is the¬†‚ÄúPresident Most Likely To Keep Me Alive‚Äù.  Answer to If Trump recovers from COVID-19 with no issues, won‚Äôt he be broadcasting to the whole nation that it‚Äôs not as big of an issue as it seems? by Sandy Patterson
I know he'd make a commercial saying how weak Biden was and how he was lying about being sick because you know it's a hoax and that's how they were going to get more votes and the Sons would be high as a kite all over the news right now
Biden is a dirty low ball Democrat to take money from Rothschild just like Woodrow Wilson and many others to Vote Trump out ! Trump does not follow #NWO like Obama Biden Hillary ! So you want death stupid Democrats you vote for Biden there is a hell and God !
Do you know who the guy is holding Biden's hand Eddie? He fought against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was a longtime member of the KKK. You sure you want a guy who's buddies with someone like that as your president?
Just finished watching the DL; what a lyin‚Äô bigot  is! Both Biden and Trump equally responsible for the failed debate?
This is not Biden‚Äôs problem. trump wouldn‚Äôt suspend his.
Biden should ask for that test now.. You ready Lil Donnie?
I honestly regret voting for Hillary. She was so fucking bad that she still lost even tho many like myself held my nose. At least she said the right things. Biden can give two shits about my views ... So again, no thanks to any shit sandwich.
Well, I will take another 4 years of that since the policies are far better than the alternative socialist model we will get with Harris/Biden. Is that what you are advocating?
Reminder: GOP put us into the Great Recession: Obama/Biden saved us even with GOP resistance
I no longer play along to this game that allowed Republicans and corporations to win for decades. Let Trump win. Dems can either whine like babies and blame voters or take responsibility for chosing shit candidates like Hillary and Biden. I think the former will happen.
Riots for dead felons Wishes death to President  Defends Joe Biden not taking drug test Demands to know minute details of President's COVID treatment.  #TrumpCOVID
Oh you silly silly son of a bitch   "In fact, Trump pronounced Democratic criticism of his pandemic response a hoax."
A hhh, no. Why should Biden pay for Trump being an idiot.
. In txt exchange w/Biden cmpgn wrkr, got this txt "I think it's time 2 address the racial, gender, &amp; income-based disparities across our laws &amp; policies" Sounds t like Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©¬†of French Rev which -&gt; Reign of Terror &amp; Napoleon
Trump campaign will keep posting negative adds about VP Biden. No class from Trump, none at all. Vote nov 3rd.
Hells NO ... There's NOTHING in the Constitution that would justify this. Trump gets no special treatment, ESPECIALLY since we ALL know he wouldn't do it for Biden. No way. Nice try, though.  #TrumpIsALoser
No problem. Just vote for Joe Biden.
Trump is also positive with covid when Biden isn‚Äôt. Trump is also in the hospital when Biden isn‚Äôt. Dumbass republicans had to have their event where no one wore a mask and now look at the outcome. I don‚Äôt give a damn who‚Äôs tested daily.
Trump will win in a landslide as long as we get a fair vote. More Trump supporters line the roadway that Biden drives down to reach one of his rallies then attend. Biden isn‚Äôt just bad, he‚Äôs pathetic.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
I bet it is one of the same people who tried to debunk Biden wearing a wire during the debate! üòÇüòÇ
Just found a street in my neighborhood with 5 Biden signs and 0 Trump! My faith in Scottsdale is restored!
Simple as this. How about trump shows up when he‚Äôs supposed to so he can get tested? Trump is a buffoon, a con man, a narcissist and a pathological liar. He has no ‚Äúhonor‚Äù and if were Biden‚Äôs campaign I would‚Äôve told him to fuck off and get tested.
Go Joe Biden President üòÅ
VP Joe Biden. No weapon turned against you will Succeed My Lord My God Will Silence Every Voice Raised To Accuse you these benefits are enjoyed by the Servants of the lord their vindication will came from me  I Lord , Have Spoken! This is the massage for You Joe Biden. God bless

Imagine if Biden had gotten COVID.
Just saw an ad with a great message: Joe Biden‚Äôs time has come and gone. I don‚Äôt trust him with America‚Äôs future. #Truth!
I know this is a year old but the fact that most people don‚Äôt really pay attention to it is interesting. You really think he has changed?
Sorry, I have to say that this graph could be misleading.  The aerosol particles may not drop to the floor due to gravity.  Think about the ventilation system that might have carried them to where Biden stood.  Any future debate events should be cancelled.
Only if Biden wins
VP Pence will be in #Arizona hosting a campaign event on Thursday - the same day as Biden and Harris - after the campaign said #POTUS won‚Äôt be at the rallies scheduled for Monday and Tuesday (and those are postponed/virtual)    #Election2020
Getting a little ahead of yourself there, or are you as delusional as Biden is? I guess his supporters don't fall far from the same tree.
The Party really wants him to lose to Biden.
Pray for Trump and vote for Biden.
He was mocking  VP Joe Biden and not only for wearing a üò∑ but try to humiliate him whit his Son ‚Äòs  Donald Trump Deserves everything that is happening to him he has put this nation In hell this very moment the American people are looking to a total LOOSER EVIL ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•.

Lots of people hoping trump dies BUT what I‚Äôve been hoping is both trump &amp; biden test positive, neither of them die but they get pretty sick and realize the stress of the presidency is not worth the physical toll on their bodies.  Bernie then steps up. We live happily ever after.
Hunter Biden Report Bombshell: Biden Was Briefed About Son, Caused Problems In Obama White House  your a scumbag
Even nobody is better than Biden!
. if Putin is a Trump surrogate how come Biden's son is the one getting paid by Russia, China and the Ukraine?  Sounds to me like you're running cover for Biden's corruption so how much is your "take"?
If Biden is a Christian I am an angel! What an evil man!
Bs! He wouldn't show grace for Biden or anyone--why should he get special treatment for his own stupidity?
Half full though of empty Biden talking points
needs to declare a war on covid. If Trump doesn‚Äôt die he will come back as the ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù and commit to fight covid. His ratings will  go up. Who cares if you already gave a plan Biden, do it again and make it sexy.
Biden‚Äôs promises are all great sounding lies for the ignorant masses!
White Supremacist Who Organized Charlottesville Race Riots Endorses Joe Biden
If Biden said ‚Äúthe sky was falling‚Äù would you believe that too?
Biden quits aggressive election ads against President Trump üëç BUT Trump continues his anti Biden ads üò°.. Just shows who's the adult here in this election... Trump is truly a bad person.. so if his followers agree they are no better than he is
He shouldn't have done that, disagree strongly with him trying to show sympathy for Chump when Chump would absolutely NOT do the same back for Biden!
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.
The Bible tells us not to lie. You are not pro-life if you vote for Biden.
That's a crock of shit. The show must go on! Chump wouldn't stop the election for Joe Biden-- you can bet on that!
From  Why   can't expect to automatically get the Latino vote.
Read this thread, and then tell me how Democrats are not the party of hate.  Biden says he represents all people.  Don't believe it!
The virus infected ‚Äú7,000,000‚Äù people, not the president. CDC never claimed no one would get infected, look at the rest of the world.  Biden and Pelosi fought against the quarantine when the president tried to protect the country.
He absolutely should be on full court press. Biden should not suffer the foolish decisions of Trump.
If Biden wins you will be one of the first they come after. You just couldn‚Äôt wait until after the election
Trump chose to put himself and others at risk, adults understand they must face the consequences of their actions. Biden chose not to put himself/others at risk and Trump belittled him for this. Vote Biden/Harris.
Walking my rottweiler atm. Seen this baddie probably 40ish running. She was rocking a Trump hat. We good üá∫üá∏üôè seen one neighbor with a Biden sign.
Fact check: Trump campaign runs Facebook ads featuring fake image of Biden wearing earpiece
Pundits assume that because Trump has insulted Mexicans, Latinos are a sure vote for Biden. A recent survey of Arizona Latinos suggests otherwise.
Everyone in that hall was supposed to keep the mask on, other than the president, Biden and Chris Wallace.
Go Joe Biden for President üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Joe Biden and most of the Democrat party are blatant hypocrites.
I would never wish anyone get COVID or sick- but do not think for a second that If the roles were reversed, that our President would be sympathetic or civil to Joe Biden. He‚Äôs mocked sick, disabled and more. He would NOT take the high ground on this.
He was the one that put together the report on Biden‚Äôs corruption. Suspicious? You betcha!!
The Trump-Biden Stakes: Your Life Savings
Vice President Biden &amp; Mrs. Biden you are so much above trump, that it's nice you can give empathy to him and his family. God Bless you and keep you healthy and safe. Pls don't go in harms way again, please.
think about all the ‚Äúquiet professionals‚Äù whose jobs and livelihoods have been sacrificed because Biden and Barry did nothing in 2013 when we had the flu epidemic. And Biden called trumps travel restriction from china ‚Äúracist and xenophobic‚Äù
The Chinese have Biden in their back pocket.
Lets see, #Trump-Russia was fully debunked, but #Biden-China appears to be factual. Hmmmmm. Yet the #Stupid still insist on believing in the former. Go figure?
It potentially benefits him. But this is too elaborate and risky to be a hoax. It actually hurts him politically also. He loves to tweet, and hold rallies. He loves to be in front of camera. He's a narcissist. No way he'd be okay hiding out while Biden campaigns.
Here is my question for  and  et al ... let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that Trump is not the candidate for whatever reason.  Are you still for Biden or will you reward Pence, who has enabled and covered for all this bullshit?  Legit question.
This is why Trump most win! This freak should be in jail!!!!! Biden counter part supports this!
This is correct, media is prepaid. When you buy time online or TV you reserve space on that media. When you cancel you tend have a few days of pre paid media play out while those affiliates resell their ad space. But since this is a headline media only I guess Biden is lying.
A move that shows Biden‚Äôs character, but one, I‚Äôm afraid, that will be interpreted as weakness.
Biden won that debate!
Hey Don, I found this article about how good you are at covering things up, except your mouth of course. #Mask #TrumpHasCovid #MAGA #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #Biden
That‚Äôs actually such a good question because Joe Biden is a leader &amp; a good man &amp; is further demonstrating this by deciding to pull ads. His ads are truth. They expose truths. I personally feel no need to respond to trump‚Äôs Covid w/ compassion, but Joe is a leader &amp; a good man!
Corporation admits in court they
Gov. Christie spent four days indoors with an unmasked Trump team preparing for the debate. VP Biden spent 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump. The WH didn't bother to contact either after Hicks tested positive. They both learned about the outbreak on social media.
Instead Trump catches the Wuhan and Biden  leaves the basement?  That‚Äôs weird : almost like a plan?
Does seem strange huh. Plus Biden didn't get it.
Why wouldn't they test negative for this virus Joe Biden has basically spent this entire campaign in his basement. I don't believe there's a Democrat out there that can tell you the Democratic party's agenda
Chris Wallace is an embarrassment to himself and Fox news. He overshot his self-importance by debating the president of the United States. He was polite and soft on Joe Biden and nasty and rude to my president
For 47 years Joe Biden has accomplished very little, AND THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES.   Thank you for sharing your opinions. I do respect your opinions; however, I do not agree with you. We will just ‚ÄúAgree to disagree‚Äù..
It's been over a year I said,  "under my Command, every Avenue North through Mexico would be annihilated, impassable"... As Biden said, "it's not gonna stop, they're just going to keep coming".
No ones demanding Biden suspend his campaign except maybe Pelosi &amp; other Dems bc they're worried his dumb ass will say something stupid.
This kind of ¬´fact checking¬ª is actively harmful.  He called it a ¬´Democratic hoax¬ª     et al are committing journalistic malpractice and actively spreading disinformation and muddying the waters with a ¬´well akcuslly‚Ä¶!¬ª herr
Why didn't they show the crowd in Biden's grand Rapids rally?
That's effing ridiculous. And Biden is a true gentleman. Trump ain't!

Prosecuting Hunter Biden, he was going to HOLD THEIR $1B?  Biden is crooked,  he is suffering dementia, and we CERTAINLY DON‚ÄôT NEED A WOMAN LIKE HARRIS RUNNING OUR country.   No, in 47 years, Biden has NOT made many accomplishments. Look again. Biden cannot serve  4 yrs in office
Look what he has done for this Nation. The list is to long to mention.  Please look it up. Again put away your thoughts of the mans attitude, focus on what he has done.  Have you watched the video where Biden told Ukraine if they didn‚Äôt fire the prosecuting attorney ......cont.
So tRump has COVID now?!All these months of POTUS ridiculing us, down playing the virus, crowding in small areas, NO MASKS!   So I wonder if tRump was late to the debate on purpose knowingly knew he had COVID and wanted to give it BIDEN so he could laugh in Biden‚Äôs face #FDT MUW?
Uh, did Biden mention any plans to implement single-payer, universal healthcare coverage for ALL during his first 100 days in office in response to a disease that's claimed nearly a quarter-million lives? If not, shame on him!!!
I wonder why no law enforcement supports Biden?
Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room. He's always the news. In fact you rarely hear anything that Biden is doing while campaigning. I'm sick of this damn monster and want him gone!
When Biden speaks through his mask.
Joe Biden is too nice. They were on Twitter calling his child a crack head. They get no sympathy from me.

Trump is always questioning the health of his political opponents, nonstop smear attacks with zero merit  Biden on the other hand, on the very same day Trump goes to the hospital, removes all his campaign ads confronting Trump's performance - because character
Except his negative ads are still going out, despite Biden campaign pulling their negative ads
Have to believe Biden has an equal bot network. His campaign is dumb as dirt if they don't match fire with fire.
Some of y'all are really CHUGGING that Trump/Biden Kool-AidüòÇü§£
Biden, once mocked by Trump, now the only man on campaign trail  via
Biden wants another lockdown..
Exactly! The GOP wouldn‚Äôt let up. How do I know? Because they are asking Joe Biden to let up. And they are hypocrites. Look what they did to Obama‚Äôs SCOTUS pick. And look what they are doing now. Lying hypocrites. Don‚Äôt let up, Joe.
We know who Trump is.‚Äù  and we know who Joe Biden is he‚Äôs a man of integrity and respect. that will never change regardless of any racist evil man.‚Äù
Because Joe Biden is a decent,compassionate man and trump is trump.
There won't be any more debates. I can see the audience and Biden ruthlessly going after Trump for knowingly endangering everyone in the first debate.  He can't survive 90 minutes of that.
Another reason this is wrong move.  The very day the Biden campaign did this, the Trump campaign BEGAN running new negative ads against Biden on the Facebook platform .... more are certain to come
Suspicious indeed! That is how bad the Dems want to win, so they can stop all investigations of Biden &amp; Son, so they can dismiss Durham before he can release his report....
U literally complained that he didn‚Äôt stop for questions  Biden‚Äôs had maybe 5 press conferences, but u want Trump with COVID-19 to approach the press with a virus?   You‚Äôd then claim he tried to infect u   You‚Äôre the most incompetent ‚Äújournalist‚Äù ever  #JimAcosta  #Trump2020
She didn't say they should do it, only questioned whether they would? Love the picture of Biden wearing the biggest mask Trump has ever seen.
Nope. CNN did report that Biden removed negative ads while Trump says he won't do the same.
So after attacking his son Hunter &amp; completely dismissing his deceased son Beau, STILL sent this Twt,wished Trump &amp; fam well while spkng in MI,&amp; pulls negative campaign ads.Biden TRULY is a classy,empathetic, genuine human being.While the other isn‚Äôt EVEN a human beingüò°No sympathy votes for Trump. Wish him well but vote Biden. EVEN if Pence is the nominee , vote Biden!!
No, here‚Äôs the truth. Your boy Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a large bathroom with supporters. Yes there were empty seats but he still outdraws Biden a thousand to one. How do you like that fact?
Your boy Biden can‚Äôt fill a large bathroom  with supporters. Every Trump rally has been gigantic. That‚Äôs what worries you. What worries me is... you think ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù and respecting the flag by showing it... is propaganda. Spin that A hole.
Biden and his Wife tested negative for covid. Trump and his wife didn‚Äôt. So Trump is at a hospital with covid and his wife is home with hers. Sad
You are blaming COVID on Trump?  Trump stopped travel from China is January and was called a "Xenophobe" by you leftists, Pelosi and Biden.  What say you about Pelosi inviting people in her district to parade in Feb?
Also, go look up some of the stuff Biden has said about people of color. You'll be mindblown
So vote Biden and Co in so we can enjoy more months of lockdowns and also socialism.
And this is why Biden must continue to show he is better. The racist are still energized
Kyrsten.  Please talk to GOP Senators.   Use your bipartisan skills.  Convince GOP senators to endorse Biden, and vote against Trump.  You‚Äôre too nice to Trump and McConnell.  Don‚Äôt be.  Get mean.
He would increase them and Call Biden weak for catching it.
The Biden‚Äôs are almost to the White House!!!üòÑüòÑüëçüòõ
Joe (Ann Green / Biden)
Why Joe Biden can't expect to automatically get the #Latino vote  via  Just don't get why any Latino, person of color or woman, would vote for Trump. Are they not paying attention?
The Republicans will be too busy jamming Corey Barrett on to the supreme court before they are defeated bigly Nov. 3.  So much for democracy.  Biden will have a tough time repairing the damage that has been done in the past four years.
If you can't vote this year just vote for Joe Biden in 2024.
Tbh I still think Hillary lost more than Trump won. I don‚Äôt think Biden has that same hate but who knows
How much do you want to bet that the Trump administration knew Trump was infected with the vrius before the debate and decided that if Trump already had it, might as well infect Biden with it as well. Cuz you know thats how Trump's brain works
This is a lie...
More likely they know Biden is just a figurehead for Nancy Pelosi to use as a puppet for her own evil wishes. We all fell for California‚Äôs peace and love hippy bs never realizing they were a liberal Trojan horse
You don't think Basement dweller Biden isn't "RACIST" üò°
These people have no scruples, they would absolutely lie under oath. Frankly who gives a damn? Either biden wins or we're fucked. We can return to this distracting bs after the election.
The pot calling the kettle black. Biden is the one who needs to denounce white supremacy.
Did you all hear no one showed up in Nevada today for the Harris/Biden event to get out the vote??  Nevada is going red!  Sick of these DEMONrats like that Sissy Governor ruining the economy!
This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.
In your humble opinion is Joe Biden a Globalist or America First?
Let‚Äôs remember to keep Biden and his campaign Top priority! #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020 #BidensUnitingUS
Because shitty people stick with shitty people. And Biden, Obama, Hillary, Harris offered their condolences right away.
Why your family does not do anything nice for people. Name calling, smears, lies, maybe if the Trumps were nicer it would help. Donny j. Trump has no empathy.  If it was Biden wonder what mean thing your daddy would say.
I would not doubt that Trump tried to infect Joe Biden and his wife. Combined with his sense of invulnerability it seems entirely possible.
Traitors. If our country goes down if God forbid Biden wins. You can add your names to the list of traitors responsible for our downfall.
And my best friend, her daughter, and her husband all registered and are voting Biden. First time for all of them- and the husband was a Trump supporter...
I am nervous about Biden. The more news we get about how Trump and his staff handled this  ugh.
That‚Äôs what class looks like Mr. Trump. Take notes now or from your hotel when Biden moves into the White House but please take notes!!
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
If this thing was actually highly contagious don‚Äôt you think Biden would‚Äôve gotten it or is going to get it? This should be an eye opener
The man who tried to invoke Biden‚Äôs stuttering through cruelty earns him zero sympathy. Get the ventilator ready for the big man.
Hope you guys added Biden to list. Looking like he could very well have been exposed w Trumps avoiding pre debate test, # of debate workers now sick. Registered GOP, who will be unglued if Simon the Sorcerer (Trump) negligent attitude costs Biden.
Lol, get serious. Trump has been campaigning for four years. Biden has three years to go to catch up. Hypocrisy rules Republicans!
The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Richard Spencer Reiterates Support for Biden, Disavows 'Useless' and 'Traitorous' GOP  #DNCPolicies
Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
just saw video of Boris Johnson sending well wishes to Trump, and he was wearing a "Build Back Better" hard hat. That was also on the equipment in the background. Biden stole their slogan from London!
Why does the media continue to cover Trump‚Äôs condition when all they can say is that they have no information? Please cover Biden all day and cut in with breaking news if they release anything concrete!  Dear Lord! How many times can they say they don‚Äôt know?
just saw video of Boris Johnson on jobsite wearing a Build Back Better hard hat.  that was also on the equipment in the background. Biden Campaign stole slogan from London!
You don‚Äôt get it do you? Trump just took any and all attention away from Biden. He will dominate the news with this and Biden will fade.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
I would be the first to say that Dem party overall needs to find commom cause with pro-life/anti-abortion folks.  Despite that, these pro-life evangelicals for Biden understand that soooooo much more is on the line this election.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
That debate should have been stopped because of that. If Biden gets sick, whoa Nellie. I think the country will become unglued. This selfish selfish selfish man has been COVIDs #1 supporter thru his handling and minimizing of this crisis.
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
About same troop levels, no major new wars, and failing coups.   My thought was where do we want our problems.  Home:Trump  Abroad:Democrats  Not voting for Trump or Biden but I still think it holds true and would rather have to face our problems here
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Biden wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about his plan, Wallace hates Trump, how do you prepare? Trump got Biden to denounce the violence and say he doesn‚Äôt support the NGDü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biden should lose 1/3 of the DNC support for those 2 things, the new taxes should do the rest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
Expanded Hours! Our office is open today and Sunday, Oct. 3-4, from 9 to 4. Pick up yard signs (out of Biden/Harris) and please consider doing a no-contact lit drop for candidates. We're at: 290 S Alma School Rd, Suite 15, Chandler (please wearüò∑)
While not quarantining, Biden generally displays very Covid-safe behavior and I'm sure he's doing even more now.  I trust his judgement that he won't be flippant about it.
Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Sorry, that comment was towards Biden, not you. My mistake. Stay safe my fellow patriot.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
This is about as silly as the ridiculous Biden had an earpiece nonsense.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump Vs Biden Debate, Our Thoughts  via  #WalkAway #VoteRed #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
No Biden shouldn‚Äôt cancel anything.trump would be making fun of him just like he did Hillary.
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Biden better be #maninabubble
The current news cycle focused on Trump‚Äôs prognosis and the numbers of infected Republicans from last week‚Äôs super spreader events is the most effective negative ad Biden could hope for, and it‚Äôs costing him nothing.
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I hope he does, at least with him, we know what we‚Äôre up against and know we can beat him. I don‚Äôt want to lose all the Republicans for Biden.
Biden oversaw the longest stretch of job growth in American history. Obama/Biden added more NEW jobs in their last 3 years than Trump did in his first 3. Then he crashed the economy and will leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. Get your facts straight.
I have no fucks to give to Trump, Biden needs to double down and destroy #IdiotInChief Trump. We need a leader in this country not a fucking self centered micro Dick motherfucker.
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering
The same day Biden and Harris are here. So very cute of Mikey
Trump campaign will keep posting negative adds about VP Biden. No class from Trump, none at all. Vote nov 3rd.
Love Joe Biden but big mistake to back off in any way on this lying sociopathic maggot. If you were in the hospital all you would hear is how weak you are. The negative ads show who he is. Not your fault he is what he is. Undecideds to see this mans bad side. Big as his belly.
Even Joe Biden is sympathetic towards President Trump. I‚Äôve seen so many ‚ÄúDeath to Trump‚Äù tweets. Grow the fuck up!!
Go Joe Biden President üòÅ
I know this is a year old but the fact that most people don‚Äôt really pay attention to it is interesting. You really think he has changed?
Chris Wallace spoon fed Biden answers and repulsed me with his Trump attacks! Can‚Äôt go through this again.
Only if Biden wins
Lots of people hoping trump dies BUT what I‚Äôve been hoping is both trump &amp; biden test positive, neither of them die but they get pretty sick and realize the stress of the presidency is not worth the physical toll on their bodies.  Bernie then steps up. We live happily ever after.
. if Putin is a Trump surrogate how come Biden's son is the one getting paid by Russia, China and the Ukraine?  Sounds to me like you're running cover for Biden's corruption so how much is your "take"?
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.

It potentially benefits him. But this is too elaborate and risky to be a hoax. It actually hurts him politically also. He loves to tweet, and hold rallies. He loves to be in front of camera. He's a narcissist. No way he'd be okay hiding out while Biden campaigns.
This is why Trump most win! This freak should be in jail!!!!! Biden counter part supports this!

Here is a thoughtful and prayerful reflection from the bishop of El Paso, Texas. Bishop Seitz: Single-issue voting has corrupted Christian political witness
Except his negative ads are still going out, despite Biden campaign pulling their negative ads
Have to believe Biden has an equal bot network. His campaign is dumb as dirt if they don't match fire with fire.
Exactly! The GOP wouldn‚Äôt let up. How do I know? Because they are asking Joe Biden to let up. And they are hypocrites. Look what they did to Obama‚Äôs SCOTUS pick. And look what they are doing now. Lying hypocrites. Don‚Äôt let up, Joe.
Because Joe Biden is a decent,compassionate man and trump is trump.
I hear ya, but if you want Biden in the whitehouse be careful what you wish for, because it wouldn't be good
The Obama Admin did the same thing w the Bush Admin. Who's to say the Biden Admin wouldn't do the same thing for the Trump Admin? They will!
Who cares what Fox News  demands? Biden for President!
Going well? More than 200,000 dead because of your criminal, incompetent handling of this crisis, and you think it's going well? No. It will be going better, though, after Joe Biden is our President.
This is exactly the reason Joe and team need to keep their foot on the gas pedal now more than ever and NOT let up!!! Trump will do whatever he can to win, Biden MUST do the same!!!
Seriously! Fuck Biden
Biden is the one doing the half quote.
This is hypocrisy at it‚Äôs finest - Trump would never suspend! We suspended on the Supreme Court nominee with Obama, yet when the shoes on the other foot Trump does the opposite?!! Biden should keep his foot on the gas pedal!! FOX News is worthless!!!!
This, after a month of Biden lids...
Yeah, pretty close. But if Biden gets it a week before and is in the hospital on election day, that's about the worst case scenario.
Everything him and his sycophantic fanboys/girls made fun of Biden for especially that mask comment have come back to bite them in the ass in the most delightful of ways ü§£
And increase his poll numbers by getting sympathy. Also helps get the horrible debate behavior he exhibited. It also got Biden to remove all the negative ads about Trump. If the rolls were reversed you know Trump wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
All his yelling at Biden was him trying to give it to him
Yeah read my original quoted tweet where he calls me a moron.   I asked him to admit he is wrong that NO WAY Biden does one debate.   Always a way have no idea last presidential election that didn't have at least one debate.
That Trump is being released from hospital because he never tested positive for Covid. It was staged to get people to forget his debate with Biden &amp; gain sympathy to gain in the polls.
You were never voting for Biden. #WearADamnMask
Hillary won the college educated white women in 2016 &amp; Biden is increasing that gap. So suburbs are more at ease with Biden. Non college educated white women saw him as the noise and feel it‚Äôs not worth it with him being at the helm. What jobs he brought back from China?
Well yeah he did won less votes because most people thought he‚Äôs insane and didn‚Äôt like him. Same was the case with Hillary. IMO polls are underestimating Biden and this isn‚Äôt a close election. Many people just didn‚Äôt turn out last time as they thought Hillary had it in the bag

Fair question. I'm a centrist dem. If they were going to turn on Biden, they wouldn't have run ads attacking  *Susan Collins *Lindsey Graham *MitchMcConnell  etc.  They know that the Republican party needs to be burned down.  That's all I'll accept.  PERIOD.  They enabled treason
Nope. He continues to run negative adds against Biden. Trump would never do that
Way more than Obama and Biden ever gave out in Economic Relief payments,.
Maybe this is why they want Biden to stop campaigning.

Prove it! I have statements from Biden that show he is a racist. Go look up and follow Leo Terrell, David Webb, Larry Elders or Candace Owens. Ask them if they are racist and weather or Trump is a racist. By the way, they are all black. Do some research, you might learn something
I believe it‚Äôs very simple.  The Biden campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to move is empathy.  The Trump campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to moves are mockery and self-adulation.
Of course. It makes Biden look tougher than the fragile ego of the President.
Don't forget the shit he said about Hunter at the debate while Biden was talking about Beau. They are so disrespectful, even through times like this.
I miss the old Biden/Obama memes from the 2017 transition.
that's great joe biden.  don't forget we want M4A, GND and debt forgiveness.
I just saw a negative Biden ad.
Stupid. His negative adds aren‚Äôt pulled vs Joe. Running ever 2 seconds in AZ. Got a lady hiding under the bed calling 911 in Joe Biden America. All footage courtesy of current Trump America.
I think it's smart. He knows Trump wouldn't pull his. It makes Biden look like the adult, a leader.
Clearly Biden's a far better human than anyone in tRump's campaign.  Given that campaign's response, I say put back those negative ads!
Hey asshole, Biden's not laying in Walter Reed either!
.  if joe biden won the election he would be inheriting a white house full of covid19 to welcome him.  .
.  why did joe biden pull out his negative ads?  .
Yes. Despite everything they've done and all the rigging, they would mean he would have run a different campaign. as Biden said "I'm the Democrat party". Progressives might actually realize their leverage / power. They could restructure. Definitely move in the right direction
Trump should repay taxes and penalties, appear in all court cases, appear before congress, stop trying to steal another justice appointment, give DNA in sexual assault cases, face charges for not divesting his businesses. Etc.  Then we'll talk to Biden. Oh, and quit lying!
Dear God, you people are vile and every day you show us how great Biden is by comparison.

Cos Biden has class!
Agreed! I cant stand Biden, or Obama. But would never wish ill health on them. I hope Trump has a speedy recovery.
Interesting that you believed the lies lol.  The men he allegedly said this about stepped forward and said no such thing happened. Nothing on video or recording. But we do see and hear Biden calling them stupid bastards and dull
to say she's defending white supremacists just shows how ignorant and uneducated you are. You are aware of Biden's racism problems? Strom Thurmond, Robert Byrd both klansmen, 1984 crime bill, calling black kids roaches...
I live in blue midtown Phoenix, and just drove to the red ‚Äòburbs for wedding. Saw two Republicans for Biden billboards fr. two different orgs. No Trump.   There is board in central Phoenix which says ‚ÄúTrump will stop the rioting &amp; looting.‚Äù There‚Äôs no rioting/looting here. Dumb.
Trump has denounced White Supremacy over a dozen time. You guys are bent on a failing talking point. Give it a rest already. It's not like Trump called a klansman a mentor (nope, that was Joe Biden who did that)

Biden is out campaigning. Don isn‚Äôt. Win.
When Biden is elected do I personally have to burn my American flag or do I have to call a bureaucrat to come do it for me?
Of course they did . . . .
You too , it was actually good to hear your POV and barrel back and for, we do have a choice like 2016 of who is the better of 2 evils.  I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden lost the election in the debate by not supporting the NGD, his statement on the violence,saying he will shut US down
Joe Biden will get the virus under control, save lives and bring back our economy. Pass it on.
All because President S**t-for-brains didn't wear a mask and taunted Biden for wearing one???      Fox News ain't thinking this one through (as usual). Trump's numbers will go up if he has a thermometer in his gob and not flapping his gums.
curious question  suppose trump dies from this and i dont wish it, obviously pence would become president but would the election go on with pence as the R nominee? Also would this mean you would throw biden under the bus and back pence since its no longer trump?

Then Biden‚Äôs ‚Äústaff‚Äù should keep the negative ads on the air.
who do you think those ads appeal to? we know the base is set. Biden is making the right call imo, but I get where you are coming from.
Karma. He stood at the debate making fun of Joe Biden for the large size mask that he wears and that he wears it even when he doesn't need to. Clearly, Trump should have been appreciative of this. And Trump weighs 244 lb not the weight that was quoted at his so-called physical.
It also does not mean they are taking down advertising period. The ads are still there just the positive Joe Biden ones.

Although I agree with you I would hope you realize if it was biden that was ill most  supporters would be cheering
you guys scoffed at hillary when she was sick with pneumonia. his is this any different? trump even made fun of her at a rally. at least biden tweeted and sent his support to trump and melania.
The difference is that there‚Äôs really nothing negative in Biden ads, they‚Äôre facts.  Trump ads are based on conspiracy theories and spin
Name one thing Biden has done in 47 yrs in govt to help the American citizens, other than enrich his family
you do realize I'm vehemently anti Biden, correct? #NeolibsAreTheDisease #TrumpIsTheSymptom #EndTheDuopoly #NeverBiden idk how someone can be #BLM and advocate for Captain Crime Bill and the Cop.  But if you're cool with it I dont mind the follow.
Biden has pulled all negative ads. Trump released one today about the conspiracy that Biden wore a mic during the debate. Fox can demand whatever they want, but they will get nothing.
While Biden takes down negative adds regarding Trump's handling of the virus, Trump campaign continues negative after negative add against Biden regarding law and order.  I am seeing 10 a day here in Arizona full of reps of police unions.
Of course not. Joe Biden has more class and compassion in his little finger than Trump has in his big, fat body.
Donald Trump has put antifa and the KKK as domestic terrorist organizations. You can repeat the lie as many times as you want but facts don't care about your feelings. Trump never paled around with klan recruiters unlike Biden.
Disregarding the Constitution is Trump's game, not Biden's. Glad to see you care nothing at all for the Constitution of the U.S.
I think your point is mute. If Biden wins, Willies knee pad trollop win ascend the Presidency.
Biden nobody wants to hear from you!
Trump and Biden don‚Äôt really get along
when you're done with Michael Moore  go back and do some Hunter Biden,  then we'll switch to HRC and Benghazi
This also disturbed me a great deal. It also disturbs me that Biden called the late KKK leader Robert Byrd his friend and mentor. I wish great candidates could emerge that would unite us. How nice to anxiously go vote without plugging our noses!
Biden is a disgusting human as well. Why do you care? You're from Austrailia. I wish I had a better candidate. But I don't so I will go for a businessman, not a loser in politics for 47 years.
We used to eat up those Biden and Obama memes and now we hate him. Growth.
Biden needs to put them back up.
Mine did. And, I went back to sleep and got the best rest in nearly 4 years.  My thoughts? Tube him, let him lay there until after the election when we can get Biden voted into office. The nation would do just fine, without his tweeting and divisive words.
Biden absolutely need to stay the course

Makes sense, he can work out of the presidential office there while he takes it easy for a few days - although I'm sure his idea of taking it easy is busier than Biden hiding in his basement üòÖ
Biden is suspending all negative ads.  Big mistake.
Biden should be punished FOR TAKING Covid seriously, AND, cause Trump tested positive for something he claims doesn‚Äôt exist?  RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Would Trump do the same for Biden?
I think it‚Äôs fine if the Biden camp wants to be somber but they can‚Äôt act like he‚Äôd do the same for them.
That‚Äôs obvious, Biden in his infinite wisdom just thought of it!
Joe Biden doesn't need the likes of Fox News to tell him what is right to do. He has good instincts because he is a good person.
Biden pulls all negative ads about Trump but U  know Trump wouldn‚Äôt do the same for Biden.  I‚Äôm not an uncaring person but with all Trump has done 2 our country, the unnecessary deaths due to his lies about Covid.  He‚Äôs trying to end our democracy. All‚Äôs fair in love &amp; war.
#BidenHarris2020  Biden had a great speech today.
Look at that. #biden campaign just stop all negative advertising.  Class...nothing but class... #TrumpHasCovid  #FLOTUS  #BidenHarris2020  #BidensUnitingUS
Donald Trump to be hospitalized following Covid diagnosis, White House says ‚Äì live | Donald Trump | The Guardian
Biden And Trump Campaigns Pursue Different Strategies In AZ | KJZZ
I don‚Äôt think Pence can run. He can be acting President thru the 25th amendment. Biden would be President in Jan which will be end of Trump‚Äôs term.
Fair, but continuing to shit on trump while he‚Äôs sick will only dissuade Border votes from choosing Biden.
I think it‚Äôs respectably classy for Biden to let up a little bit, but they need to be careful to not lose ground for no reason
has anybody expressed concerns about Biden having been breathing the air so close to Trump when he was yelling and hollering at the debate?
Biden launches ads touting his faith after cardinal says he's 'not a Catholic in good standing'  #FoxNews #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
(...I do wish him well...for reals...)  What would FoxNews do...if this were Biden?
Imagine what tRump would be saying if this was Biden.
This is such a silly question to pose? Why should Biden halt his campaigning just because Trump got Covid-19?  You reap what you sow.
Absolutely not. Biden has been smart and following guidelines while Trump has been reckless and making it worse. Also, if Rs can push Judah‚Äôs appointment while Trump is sick, Biden can keep campaigning.
Live updates: Trump to head to Walter Reed after positive coronavirus test - The Washington Post
The problem is that Biden can say anything because MSM never fact checks him
I am begging all legislators and other leaders--please take this opportunity to RECANT your lies about #COVID19, admit you were wrong, and save the lives of your constituency.
State of the Union 2022: Kamala Harris: *declares unlawful assembly and unloads 8 clips into the audience for clapping* Biden, like Porky the Pig: That's all folks!
Live updates: Trump expected to head to Walter Reed hospital after positive test; Biden tests negative for coronav‚Ä¶
üëç so after saying Biden was hiding in his basement, Trump will be hiding in his bunker.
The world would breathe a sigh of relief. Then Biden would be elected and normalcy will return.
This f****** moron Joe Biden he's talking about masks when they were allowing all these rioters and protesters to run around the streets without mask and then he worries about the great president not wearing a mask go figure typical Nazi.
Biden is going to win. He was going to win before this. He'll win after this.
The white supremacy narrative, Biden's misunderstanding of the constitution &amp; a discussion on socialized medicine
So if Biden wins is there a way to sterilize the White House?
Yes especially since  is airing a Biden speech.
BIDEN: "We're going to bring Jack brack jobs"
I would rather have a president that has China virus which is 99.9% curable then a president with dementia and is a Nazi who only cares about lining his own Pockets like Joe Biden and Joe also wants to destroy America for China.
Biden scores points with this one.
No. He made his bed so now he has to sleep in it.  He chooses not to wear a mask, participate in rallies, and making fun of Biden for wearing masks &amp; social distancing.  If I go party all night knowing I start a new job the next day,  should they hold my job?
It's important to keep in mind that most of what Trump says is projection. When he says Biden will be a puppet to the extreme left, what he really means is "republicans are going to put sunglasses on my bloated, orange corpse."
Lol - Biden Interrupted Trump first... 34 minutes into the debate. Trump is a street fighter... and he‚Äôs challenging the ‚ÄúHolier than thou‚Äù mentality of lifetime politicians. That‚Äôs why many do not like his presence - his foot is not in his mouth it‚Äôs in their arse.
He would demand that Biden drop out of the race.
Donald trump is the president until Biden is inaugurated
And all this prior to COVID    Since then he's brokered deals between three Arab countries and Israel. Something Joe Biden's administration insisted was IMPOSSIBLE.
excited for  SNL as Biden. don't forget he basically played him on In Living Color decades ago.  And when will  get to host!?? In fact,  Bring in the cast of In Living color to host. Carrey, Grier, Wayans's's, Davidson, Fox
Trump's campaign would double up on the negative ads, plus they'd capitalize on Biden's sickness. Wait, I thought this was "just like the flu"? Why all the worry, Republicans?
Agree with those saying this is a bad tweet. Biden didn't pull out his mask at the debate. If anything, it was Trump who was signaling his (false) virtue by pulling out his mask--a mask he doesn't wear in public.
pence if something happens to pence then pelosi but if biden also has it and they both go down what the hell would happen
"This is what will happen in Biden's America!"  (Footage taken in Trump's America.)
‚Äúfuel to the fire‚Äù is another one of those vague metaphors that means nothing in this political context. y‚Äôall were terrified they would call bernie a communist during the campaign. now they‚Äôre calling biden a communist anyway. because they‚Äôre liars and you‚Äôre bad at politics.
sorry but wouldn't you guys agree that if you claim to be neutral in Trump vs Biden , you either wouldn't care or you wouldn't support one over the other ? like if you want one over the other , then that's who you support ? like cmon guys this is 6th grade vocabulary
You know why I vote for and believe in Trump? Bc if Trump continues to succeed then other businessmen will be emboldened to run for POTUS. That he will end the endless cycle of career politicians lining their bank accounts with Backdoor deals and yes I‚Äôm looking at u, Biden
Joe Biden is older, and weaker.
And you think Biden isn‚Äôt ü§£Biden has spent his entire career ‚Äúenriching‚Äù himself and his family, and dam right I want to know why a Russian oligarch paid hunters company 3.6million, it‚Äôs important, Hunter is a security risk to US and Biden is to bc of him
Biden‚Äôs outreach has been to lock us up, call us predators, tell us if we don‚Äôt vote for him ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. What are you saying?
My feelings are Joe may be sincere, but it‚Äôs also a way of them to say ‚ÄúSee what happens when you don‚Äôt wear a mask!‚Äù  Bingo:  Joe Biden I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
I‚Äôm looking for the danger? How has killed anymore blacks than the previous 4-5 administrations? What are we scared of exactly? I did not say I support Trump. I‚Äôm pushing back on the narrative that Biden is better. Frankly, Trumps record is better for black people than Biden‚Äôs üëÄ
"Democrats" is a blanket statement.  Biden made a very solid message hoping Trump had a recovery.  Don't confuse "Democrats" with everybody registered to that party affiliation
Inauguration day: President Pelosi until Biden wins, watch.
Trump he hired excellent accountant. Now let see Obumer taxes, he came with less than 1 mln and left with 40mln. Let's see Biden's taxes, I wonder if he paid taxes for the bribes he got from Russian billionaire for human trafficking.
Bull--Biden took appropriate precautions, trump didn't so his bad!
Strawman my ass. People are acting like Biden/Harris are gonna be the cure to all of our ills. I‚Äôm stating they are objectively just as much a cause of them too. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúHere take this pill. It will kill you in 4 days instead of 3‚Äù. How about I don‚Äôt take any ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This issue is acting like Biden is somehow a better choice for black people over Trump. They are both clowns. But at least Trump has tried to reach out to blacks. Kamala is even worse. So voting 3rd party is a much preferable option than choosing any the mainstream party choices
So a lot of politicians like Biden are gonna be like "Thoughts and prayers are with them for a swift recovery" yada yada because yeah, if you're gonna be in charge of a whole country you have to show you won't pull a Trump and let the people on the other side die just becuz.
Outside force, Biden couldn't stop him.
Thank God you &amp; Doctor Biden are alright. I hope your team is safe as well. #WENEEDYOUüá∫üá∏
Does anyone think if the situation was reverse trump would stop?He would make fun of Biden for wearing a mask and still getting sick.
Instant Karma: Trump bashing Biden for wearing a mask wherever he goes and gets coronavirus the very next day. Love it. ü§£ #Debates2020
"His campaign is not happy."  That's hilarious.  It's been the case for at least several weeks.  Biden knows who his base is: antifa.
one of my friends that has never registered to vote and he is 28 just texted me and said he will be registering this year to vote for Joe Biden after the debateü•∫ü•∫ I‚Äôm such a proud friend rn
Umm this ain‚Äôt happening no more. I don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are talking about Biden ain‚Äôt taking that risk for muthafucking what ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah they don‚Äôt tell you which is great shows they are the weakest of the weak . They haven‚Äôt been anywhere. Just watch Biden will catch it real soon
Say what?  Challenge for Biden hmmmmm. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll take that challenge and win because we know who wears the clown shoes.
Joe Biden tests negative for coronavirus
Yeah I can‚Äôt even imagine what the comments would be from the right if it was Biden who had come down with covid.  They would be even more relentless just like they are with everything else.  Don‚Äôt play the victim!
That's what the Right insinuated Biden would do. It was laughable.   Trump faking Covid would be politically damning. It would have been the end of the campaign for Biden.   That being said, Lorraine is promoting Qanon and it deserves to be called out.
Good. Because those idiot Trump supporters refuse to wear a mask.    is one of the worst, and she's supposed to be a Nurse. Let Biden come!!!
Jim Carrey as Joe Biden I cant fucking wait.
There's no reason to believe that Walter Reed staff are not compromised as well. I don't believe that there's anyone at all that's going to be solidly reliable about this. Maybe we'll know someday if Biden is elected and there's a clean sweeping out of cult members.
I love Joe Biden
Who is Alex Jones ? In case you missed it I listen to music all day not the media.  Bottom line Joe Biden is an incompetent ‚Äúpublic servant‚Äù whose only accomplishment has been to make himself and the people around him rich, trump has driven the economy and employment to records
So Biden AND Chris Wallace had the kobiashimaru , there was NO WAY they could succeed with the king of crap.  Now miraculously he has COVID! Just in time to distract from what he said in debate and time to gain sympathy donations - solicitation online now.  Sick #TrumpFakesCovid
Why would he want to get out of the debate ? Biden is a tool and he chewed him up and spit him out . What a bunch of idiots you know
You‚Äôre not wrong. Look at all the ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù racist remarks Biden has made; not just over the years, but most recently, too.
I'm sure you'll be 'fine' in a few day and you'll go about biz as usual proving a distraction to America for your husband's iditotic debate, white supremacy advocation and a time out for news on Joe Biden.  Did I miss anything?
Stay healthy Joe Biden XOXO
You seem to pay close attention to what happens with the NPP. So I figured i'd let you know
Low key Trump and Biden both getting Rona really would‚Äôve been a best case scenario for America
oh man, I bet Trump would feel really stupid right now for making fun of how much Biden wears a mask during the debate if he wasn‚Äôt a soulless narcissist who is incapable of any humility or self reflection... #TrumpHasCovid
Speedy recovery.  However, I don't like Presidents who got sick.  Or let's see your past tweets where you were sick in the head and telling Pres.Obama hug ebola patients.  Or not advising Biden hicks had tested positive. That they learned via the news. That's deplorable.
Donny j. Trump Would not wish VP Biden to get well if he had Covid. Trump could care less about the truth. He does not even believe in his own administration or CDC. Is this fake news from the Trumps. Vote nov 3rd.
Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice for a candidate but now he‚Äôs the only option.
Very nice of VP Biden. Willing to bet if it was reversed Donny j would not say a thing.
This coming from the people that said Biden was gunna ‚Äúget COVID‚Äù so he didn‚Äôt have to debate, now all of a sudden it‚Äôs unthinkable to joke about. Y‚Äôall are the biggest babies I‚Äôve ever met
like when i'm scrolling through my tl i see more posts attacking biden than i do posts attacking trump. in general, i don't really see a lot of criticism of the gop, but plenty of criticism of dems. maybe my tl is just fucked up though
Trump has tested positive for COVID. Biden has tested negative for COVID.  Let's hear it for the scientific method!
Good. Keep going. Trump wouldn't slow down and he'd be out there mocking Biden like he's been doing all this time anyways.
-Refused to encourage mask wearing by insulting people for wearing them, most notably earlier this week when he mocked Biden for his mask wearing at the debate. -Has been in several arguments against his own task force members AND the CDC. He thinks he knows more than doctors.
I know I've been contributing to Biden and to the opponents of nasty Republicans wherever I can find them. That's what happens when your lot is so completely despicable.
I‚Äôm sorry but Biden isn‚Äôt going to end racism and climate change and sexism and police brutality. Trump can‚Äôt either. Stop thinking that the president will save us. They‚Äôre puppets. How many elections do we have to go through before we realize our system is too archaic?
Lmao at the people with brain worms wondering if Biden should suspend his campaign while Trump is sick and can't campaign. Y'all realize that Trump campaigned through the entire democratic primary when nobody could campaign on our side yet because nobody had won, right?
The only way it goes down significantly is if Biden contracts COVID, as it is generally presumed he'll be elected next month and Trump's time is over anyway
especially making fun of Biden for always wearing one... is it a hoax now?
Trump: *Makes fun of Biden for trying to stay say safe by warring a mask and social distancing *  Trump: *Gets Covid-19*
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tests negative for COVID-19
Biden tests negative for COVID-19
Biden tests negative for COVID-19.
Biden tests negative, we know who‚Äôs alpha now
I am betting way too close to the election. I‚Äôm basically hoping that Biden doesn‚Äôt get covid
Chris Wallace: The Trump family was not wearing masks at the debate and they actively waived off aids who tried to give them masks.  Fox News Response:  Don't you think it would be hypocritical if Biden went door to door campaigning today?
With trump having covid, don‚Äôt let the media only focus on trump. This is the time where we bring awareness to his campaign, what he HAS NOT done &amp; why Biden is better for America. He used the word ‚Äútogether‚Äù in his tweet. Even though in 4 years he created an even deeper divide.
Awesome, speedy recovery, now go give Biden a big kiss for me!  LOL!
what dose the RNC do for a Presidential replacement for president should the Trumpster become unable to run for office. Maybe the race comes down to choice between Biden and West; that is a sobering thought
The President and First Lady will get through it and recover well.   Trump can now say something Biden and Harris can‚Äôt; ‚ÄúI had COVID19.‚Äù
Wow so Biden says he attended a delaware university and gets attacked because he didn't use the right order or words. The scotus nomination is touted as a rhodes scholar because they went to a place with a similar name? The hypocrisy is dripping.
200k+ dead Americans(and counting) plus another economic recession bc of your inability to protect and serve &amp; the audacity to still believe that this WORLDWIDE pandemic is a political hoax... you even mocked Biden for advocating to wear masks. If anyone deserves it, its you.. üò§
I'm waiting to see what Biden puts out. He has empathy so will see
For all those Democrats cheering - Biden can't hide from the crowds for ever, let alone run a country.
He was right . He didn‚Äôt get it at an event . Biden can go screw himself
Biden üò∑ should march on since the Trump virus is a hoax
Sadly in reality he‚Äôs been waitin for these debates because Biden won‚Äôt be able to keep up with him
When are you hacks going to ask Joe Biden to denounce white supremacy?  Who gave the eulogy to the grand cyclops Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan ?  Who wrote and passed Jim Crow laws? Who fought for segregation so his kids didn‚Äôt have to go to a jungle?  Oh yea that was Joe Biden
It will be ok . Keep up the fear mongering so we don‚Äôt have to have Biden here . I love it .
Ok !! So . This is nothing and you know it . Most of the tests are the ones from before . Nobody is dying in the streets . Arizona has this . Keep reporting the fear , maybe Biden won‚Äôt come .
‚Äúvote for biden or DIE‚Äù *desperately, passionately kisses trump to his ouchies better*
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris to make campaign appearance in Arizona
Trump campaign calls out second debate moderator who interned for Biden, worked for Ted Kennedy  #FoxNews #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
it‚Äôs performative decency.  you absolutely fucking cannot simultantaneously believe trump is running concentration camps, destroying democracy, and going to create a fourth reich if biden doesn‚Äôt win the election, but also want to kiss it and make it better when he gets hurt.
That's so true. Biden didn't say it. But I'm sure he thought of it.
Don't know, when pressed Chris Wallace nor Biden couldn't even name a ' white supremist ' group, any decent moderator would have been more specific with the question.
False. Trump is pro life. Biden isnt.
He is lying! He is trying to control the media so you and Biden can not get your message out before the election! He will claim the virus is no more than the flu right before voting....
It will make him stronger, even more resolve to beat Harris... I mean Biden üòè
But Biden is what??? For wearing what???? HAHAHAHA
Let's all donate to Joe Biden campaign and democrat senators.
And this is why I wanted any debate to be virtual. Trump spewed and spit all over Biden.
Does it matter what Biden says? No. Look man, Trump is the president and had knowledge of everything. A true leader would have made the call before he did...like oh I don‚Äôt know...when he found out about it? And he didn‚Äôt even ban travel. He let 40k fucking repatriate.
If both Trump and Biden were infected with Covid, who do you think would be most likely to survive?
Trump knew about Hicks as he was trying to demean Biden about wearing a mask.  #TrumpVirus #SuperspreaderEvent
An Enticing Video of Biden and Trump Not Getting Along
How is wishing someone death somehow a party-specific position?  It‚Äôs just the tasteless opinion of Americans whom see the POTUS with morbid irony. Biden isn‚Äôt responsible.  Individuals are.
An enticing video of trump and biden not getting along
. just crushed CNN!  Powerfully laid out the facts &amp; refused to play CNN‚Äôs games  Biden‚Äôs track record on race is disgusting  President  has a record fighting for &amp; helping all Americans regardless of race  This may be the best exchange on CNN of 2020
We don‚Äôt have to be gaining jobs, we can still be going losing them....made 0 sense.  But no trump has turned it around. Again...nothing. I understood the sentence about Biden...but I‚Äôm not voting for him either so contextually, it holds no weight.
God bless Biden, such a humble man! We need this man in the White House!!
1st the loudest Trump supports I know are POC. There is a Trump clothing stand outside my neighborhood ran by POC. 2nd I heard 3rd party get blamed for Hillary losing, so people have had at least 4 years to warm up to 3rd party. If someone doesn‚Äôt like Biden don‚Äôt vote for him.
Biden's social media peeps took the high road so some of you wouldn't have to.  That seems nice.
Biden: Damn, rough blow Donny. T&amp;P.
it‚Äôs almost as if we‚Äôve been saying this since 2016!!!ü§°are the american people REALLY letting these stupid bastards get away with things like this? Obama, Biden, and Killary for prison.
He has it. He lied and called the virus a hoax. He makes fun of Biden for wearing a mask, and for holding small campaign events. He tells reporters to take off their masks. He still holds large rallies where mask-wearing is not required. He says it affects virtually no one. 1/
Donald Trump's Family Ignored Mandatory Mask Rule at Presidential Debate With Joe Biden
I think Biden should act like Trump would act.
During the debate, it was sure amusing to Trump to make fun of Joe Biden and the size of the mask that he wears and that he doesn't need to wear it. Karma!
It could still have spread through contact, to both #Biden and #Pelosi
Total class from our next President of the United States of America üëçGo Joe Biden
If Biden positive, they should be forced to quarantine together with live cameras covering the action.
I can‚Äôt help but remember a point in the debate the other night where you roasted Joe Biden for wearing a mask too much
Imagine not understanding the left forces him to continue doing rallies but two Biden not to debate him in oct 15. HE HAS THE SAME VIRUS IF THEY WERE 8 FEET AWAY NOT WEARING MASKS THAT ARE INFORCED
Well John where‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs condemnation of BLM and Antifa? Saw a montage on OAN where Trump has denounced white supremacy dozens of times.
Trump's Supreme Court gambit could benefit Biden: Reuters/Ipsos poll  REPUBLICANS WILL PAY DEARLY AT THE POLLS IF THEY PROCEED WITH SUPREME COURT PIC DURING ELECTION! WE WILL VOTE AS MANY OUT AS WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR RIGHT! VOTE BLUE, MAKE THEM PAY!
Ask him to denounce his ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù from the past even. Byrd for one. Biden IS the white supremacist in the room!
Remember when you said Biden was wearing his mask ‚Äútoo much‚Äù? Maybe wanna follow his lead now?
You're right.  That is a far worse, uglier message, used by Biden in debate, which is why they'll run with it.  They won't be happy till there's a 2nd civil war.
WAAAAA! John Roberts check back in the hundreds is times prior he denounced white supremacy on every level. What is wrong with you ‚Äòcome on man‚Äô. Let‚Äôs try asking a tough question to Biden:Why was he spewing praise onto Byrd? Or the other times he spoke in favor of segregation?
2 days before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump mocked Biden for wearing a face mask  TRUMP SHOWS HE CAN'T HELP US OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. MASKS SAVES LIVES NOW TRUMP &amp; FAMILY HAS VIRUS. SHAME ON TRUMP. TRUMP KILLS PEOPLE VIA HIS IGNORANCE! DUMP TRUMP!!!!
Good sign. Go Joe Biden!
Biden's lead over Trump holding in battleground Arizona as voters see US on wrong track  VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS TO SAVE JOBS, LIVES, ECONOMY, SOCIAL SECURITY, HEALTHCARE, &amp; MEDICARE. TRUMP IS A LIAR AND CON MAN CRIMINAL. WE MUST VOTE REDS OUT. SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY
Glad he refused to shake Biden's hand.
If #Biden got #COVID19 you cretins would be either A) declaring it a farce to gain sympathy votes or B) dancing in the streets and praying to the bloodthirsty ‚ÄòGod‚Äô you worship that he dies an agonizing painful death. Spare us your indignation and outrage. üôÑ
I hope they didn't give to Joe Biden who has followed scientific advice.
Sen. Sinema, and before that Sec. Clinton. I'm more excited this year to vote for Sen. Harris than VP Biden this year.
anyone have word on biden getting tested
LMAO!!! "Facts and data only lack truth when you leave out certain facts or data. At that point it is not data, it is propaganda."   #TrumpSupportersAreIdiots

Fuuuuuck. Now I feel bad cause that bastard wouldn't wear a mask and even mocked it (Biden for wearing one) during the debate.   Seriously, this fucker gets worse and worse.
Biden interrupted first.
What if Trump ‚Äútested‚Äù positive to avoid the debates with Biden? Although they both suck he took the L in my opinion.
And his maskless groupies sat near Dr. Biden. Pray for Joe and Jill!
How far was Biden standing from Trump at the debate
S&amp;P futures now rebounding from the news. The market might get excited over Biden
Trump was already sweaty, mom‚Äôs spaghetti. I only wish Biden had a mask and shield on.
Will Joe Biden publicly denounce pedophilia?
I had respect for your father and also for you until you aligned yourself with Biden‚Äôs socialist handlers üò°
Or racism.. Remember that KKK guys funeral... Oh yeah.. Fellow senator of Biden..
#TrumpHasCovid so what does Biden say? If I were him, I would say, "The President now has Covid. He finally is an example to the nation of why we need to wear a mask and socially distance." And then just move to other things and policy. Don't talk about it.
GOD I PRAY YOU WILL PROTECT JOE BIDEN AT ALL COSTS!
And you can disagree with Biden's policies, and still respect him, but we cannot respect an irresponsible manbaby who thinks there are good people on both sides of a white supremacist rally who is a bully and a cheat. One is a decent human being. The other is an indecent monster.
Trump will be calling every Fox show and tweeting all day. He‚Äôll show up at next debate in exactly 14 days looking great. Biden is going to look weak and old.
Noone on you half has courage to face things personally. And when they do they blame things that I guarantee biden has this virus
Now he and how wife gave covid. Compare that to why the left is telling biden to not devate
He also closed our boarders, which Biden wouldn't have done. Who are you voting for in the next election???
I hear this might help people not get sick ...
Trump closing our boarders most definitely helped. Which Biden called xenophobic, therefore he wouldn't have done it for a while. Trump saved many lives with that.
Mind ya.....Trump about 48 hours removed from making comments about Biden‚Äôs kids, now look at em
TRUMP GOT RONA JUST TO AVOID DEBATE WITH BIDEN! Please see past the lies
Biden would have waited nearly two months before closing our boarders. Trump saved many lives with that.
So Biden has no symptoms but gave covid-19 to trump while trump was known to be around other covid-19 positive patient. Did I understand the conjecture right
Y‚Äôall Biden supporters just as ignorant as the Trump supporters
remember when he was making fun of joe biden for wearing a mask too often
Exactly why I am voting for Biden.
if joe biden gets covid too can we all please just vote for Kanye üò§
Watch "Donald Trump mocks the way Biden wears his mask" on YouTube
imagine making fun of Biden for wearing a mask and then GETTING COVID... AS THE PRESIDENT
He can't stand to lose. He can't beat Biden in a debate. Pence will pardon him for all present and future federal crimes. Best part for hi., he can blame the virus and other people who have the virus.
Pray Biden is safe
Good chance Trump &amp; Melania announcing testing positive for Corona virus is a Hoax! A diversion tactic!  He‚Äôd do anything to not have to debate Biden again!
Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask and being extra cautious was one of the most infuriating things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Would dt do that if Biden tested positive for Covid-19?  No, not a chance, he would use it to his advantage. Joe wouldn‚Äôt do that, he is an ethical and compassionate person unlike dt, Joe will announce his heartfelt best wishes for a speedy recovery for both of them + HH
My best friend is 45. She registered to vote this year. Her 22 year old daughter registered to vote this year. She just helped her 45 year husband register to vote. He was solidly Trump earlier this year and now all 3 are voting Biden.
Biden needs to be tested though. He was 15 feet away Trump without masks for 90 minutes at the debate. That is my one and only concern. If Trump gets sick, so be it. He put himself in harm's way repeatedly without care for himself or others.
This is the reason I did not want Biden to debate Trump. Biden is careful and Trump is reckless. I hope The Bidens did not get too much exposure!
He was talkin all that shit about how Biden wears a mask. I guess he spoke too soonü§≠ü§ßüò∑ü§£
This was like watching a horror movie. Asking myself, ‚ÄúWhy do keep watching?‚Äù But not being able to move from the edge of my seat. I hate that Joe Biden had to respond in an undiplomatic way, but how else do we handle a two year old bully. Shut off his mike.
Question:  How can any Black American really believe Biden is on their side?  Answer:   They have not educated themselves of the Negative Black facts of Biden's WHOLE LIFE.   Biden supports SEGREGATION.  Hehasin the 70's, the 80's, the 90 and now. #WalkAway
Remember that one time Trump made fun of Biden for wearing a mask? #TrumpHasCovid
I'm praying for Joe Biden who was on stage for 90 minutes with that idiot spewing his lies and probably the virus. And for Dr. Biden sitting in the audience with the tRump groupies not wearing masks.
Dude - what if he gave it to Biden
I bet you feel stupid for making fun of Biden for wearing a mask now dont ya?
If Biden did win (which he wont) he wouldn‚Äôt be sworn into office until January just like every other president
I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU GAVE BIDEN THE VIRUS
*patiently awaits Biden‚Äôs response
Bet you wish you were a big Biden mask now!
Yeah I was thinking that. In the debate they maintained distance but who knows ! FWIW don‚Äôt remember Trump coughing even once in the debate so I hope Biden is safe as far as debate exposure is concerned even though it can spread through aerosols while one speaks !
this mf trump was talkin about biden and his mask lmaoo now look at you
Guarden a Biden!
Y‚Äôall check on Biden please
trump getting covid is what we deserve after having to settle for biden &lt;3
the fact trump made fun of biden two days ago at the debates for wearing a mask is so satisfying rn ü•∞
I hope Biden has been tested. He was around the Big Moron.
trump should ask biden where he got his mask from he‚Äôs gonna need it
Two days ago he was steps from Joe Biden for 90+ minutes. This is horrible.
You forgot Biden
i‚Äôm convinced that if biden gets covid it‚Äôs because trump wouldn‚Äôt shut his damn mouth at the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù
pretty high tbh because they got tested before the event Trump and Biden both had masks on so i‚Äôm willing to bet they got it during the event so yea Biden needs to get tested asap
Before Tuesday. I would have bet $1,000,000 it would have been Biden that ‚Äúcaught‚Äù it just so he could avoid the debates.
Also PROTECT JOE BIDEN. that means he was contagious at the debate üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨ #Debates2020Your boss said it would just ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.  Was he wrong or was that him trying not to panic us dumb taxpayers?  Quarter million dead by election on HIS and YOUR watch. Vote Biden/Harris.
WHICH IS THE BETTER MAN...TRUMP WOULD NOT DO THAT FOR BIDEN!!!...Biden removing negative political ads following Trump COVID-19 diagnosis
Or a blizzard of tweets blaming the Chinese, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Hunter Biden, E Jean....
WHO'S THE WISE GUY AND WHO'S THE SMART ASS, NOW?Joe Biden tests negative for coronavirus
The best thing about Joe Biden‚Äôs plan?  It‚Äôll never be approved

TRUMP HAD A TOTAL MELTDOWN...WORRIED ABOUT GOING TO JAIL, IF HE LOSES...5 takeaways from the first Trump-Biden debate
B. Rabbit and the B stands for Biden
Or when Biden denied he‚Äôs for the green new deal but his website says he is. The moderator had a responsibility to seek answers but let him off. Wallace wants Biden to win and it was obvious in his approach.
How about the Gotcha questions like ‚Äúthe fine people‚Äù question but didn‚Äôt ask Biden a symmetrical race based question like what he meant about the ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù statement? Or when Biden lied about saying ‚Äúclap you dumb bastards‚Äù he said nothing.
#NBCNews Right!  Biden made a mistake saying ‚Äúshut up man‚Äù..   He should have said ‚Äúshut the fuck up asshole‚Äù........better!
It‚Äôll be a lot worse under Biden
Silence is violence- just happens to be against the Supreme Court when Biden refuses to answer.
It's also weird how he didn't ask Joe Biden to denounce antifa!  mmmü§•  #whitesupremacy  #Trump
Trump is not running against Biden; he‚Äôs running against the election process.  He doesn‚Äôt care if he loses the vote, because he‚Äôll dub the election ‚Äúrigged‚Äù and tie everything up in the courts.  He wants the SC to decide.  In his favor.
Every person from the extreme left who have nothing intelligent to say start calling people names. You followed suit tonight like any child having a tantrum.  called you out on numerous issues and you gave back nothing. We have a warrior, step back Biden.
Joe Biden showed up for a debate, Donald Trump showed up to be the comments section under a YouTube video.
Fox News literary had to cut to back to back to back anti-Biden commercials then went back and said that‚Äôs all from us... even they don‚Äôt know what to say.   #Debates2020
How many people did President Trump debate to become a President? 16!!! How many does Biden have to debate to try for the Presidency?? 1. I like a fighter, I like an intelligent man who wants to win. #Trump2020
You are all befuddled because our President is so much smarter than any of you. You can‚Äôt keep up. Listening to our President share facts, much more interesting than listening to Biden all but get onto his knees begging for votes. We the people prefer a fighter!! TRUMP!
I wish Biden was as far left as Trump pretends he is.
Chris Wallace, you are the most incompetent moderator. You are so obviously coddling Biden as he is not too bright. Name calling, a childish chump!!
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT oh Biden is so fucked
Biden: It‚Äôs his economy.    But elected officials from which states have engaged in excessive shutdowns?
I learned nothing about the Supreme Court. Why did Biden have to bring up ACA? That wasn't the question.
My Biden email said my name was Timothy this morning.
THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE...NOT THROUGH THE COURTS...Biden, Harris release 2019 tax returns ahead of debate
At least Biden has released his tax records.  Let‚Äôs start with Trump doing that then we can talk about Biden.  Deny, lie, deflect and spin.  The Trump GOP game plan.
Trump isn‚Äôt corrupt? You‚Äôre kidding me right ? Biden and Harris are corrupt why? Because Trump says so?
For the love of all that's still good in this world PUH-LEEZE have Biden see a medical professional for the dementia he has. We ALL know he's got it, just get some help! Don't let this distract you from #SaveOurChildrenGlobalMovement please sign my whitehouse petition!
She was when she cheated on her husband with Biden.
The last election the DNC assumed they didn‚Äôt need to try to win. If that‚Äôs the plan for this time I guess go for it. Don‚Äôt think people watching don‚Äôt see they are hiding the failing mind of Biden. Maybe his wife can do more press for him.
I will be donating $200 to Biden and use the card to offset that donation when I get my Rx‚Äôs filled.  Thanks.

What I appreciate about the decency of Mr Biden‚Äôs response to this debacle is that it reminds us that this did not have to be this way. President Bush or President Obama would not have plunged us into this embarrassing mess with theatrics, tantrums, and self-absorbed pettiness.

Democrats will most likely use the 25th Amendment to overtake Biden if Elected.
I have read Biden's proposal incentivize unions to strengthen workers collective bargaining. Trump is weak when it comes to unions (well, weak when it comes to labor itself.)
NOW: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will participate in a virtual town hall with the Amalgamated Transit Union on Saturday.
I look &amp; listen to Joe Biden &amp; what do I see?
Not in the least! I had already made my choice to vote Trump when i saw what a senile old fool Joe Biden is now. Looks like he aged 30 years after that debate with Paul Ryan 8 years ago
Just think of it. Let it sink in.  They deliberately premeditatedly endangered the life of Joe Biden. They expected trump would get no symptoms and no one would ever know.
It‚Äôs pretty clear  wanted to infect Biden at the debate so he could argue that masks don‚Äôt work.  We need proof of when he received his result. And if he knew he was positive before the debate he should be charged for endangerment. #TrumpCovid
Is anyone was "targeted", it was Biden.  Trump knew he was infected and went about spreading it all over the place.
I think when Biden said "Will you Shut up, Man?" God was like... okay, it's time.
If this is a sign of things to come, it signals the beginning of the end.  The only way to get rid of this lawless Justice Department, is to elect Biden.   The. Only. Way!
Did you notice that Trump is still running the hateful Ads against Biden, even though he's in the hospital, but Biden has stopped running any negative ads?    Also, it's not hate.  It's anger.
Biden winning the election. Vote.#reversethedystopia
Why isn't Mainstream Media banned for blatantly pretending to provide news?  -What they report as news is analysis  -What they term analysis is opinion  -What they call opinion is campaign advertisement for Joe Biden.  [This is opinion]
I'll up the ante. Why isn't CNN banned for blatantly pretending to be a news organization? -What they call news is analysis -What they call analysis is opinion -What they call opinion is campaign advertisement for Joe Biden.
No because he wouldn't do the same for Biden if it was him.
üòÜ like Trump would do that if Biden was ill... Trump would double down and then make fun of his speech impediment, and you know it. Trumps never been a gentleman unless he thought it might get him a piece

Trump campaign contacted donors to warn them. But not Biden.
The politicians and civil servants do not like President Trump because he is not one of them. Biden is a nincompoop that was a lap dog for Obama for 8 years. He is a non-op.
Trump never wore a mask, and neither did anyone around him. He got Covid at the Rose Garden last Saturday. Spread it to everyone. Biden and those wearing masks tested negative. Proof masks work.

Okay, but both candidates must be put in clear glass booths with their own life support systems. One to protect Biden and the other to protect everyone else.
Let's be fair.  After the bold, courageous announcement by candidate Biden to halt negative ads, it takes a few days to implement.  I'm thinking that we will begin to see the result by Nov 2.

Trump never said COVID was a hoax but they‚Äôre going to keep repeating it like it‚Äôs true.  We should start our own repeated narrative about the Democrats.  ‚ÄúJoe Biden said Black Kids don‚Äôt deserve to go to the same schools are affluent White Kids.‚Äù  Pass it on..
One agency I‚Äôd like to see Biden create is one dedicated to de-programming extreme Right Wing, incel, Proud Boy, MRA types.  I don‚Äôt need them to become SJWs, just help them into decency and gentlemanly behavior, somehow. Quiet the burning rage victim-addiction they have.
Politicians who have been impeached were either duly elected or duly appointed.  Impeachment is SUPPOSED to be independent of election results!  Trump is a power-abuser who withheld money from our ally Ukraine to get a sham announcement against Biden, and deserved it all the way!
I have been  solicited 4 times by text to register in GA where I have not lived or voted in the last 3 years I have read Biden plans to SEND people Door to door in Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states TO HELP PEOPLE VOTE? But there WILL BE NOFRAUD THEY PROMISE!! DAH!!

Yes, he would have. But Biden is playing this smart. He knows he is going to be judged like a regular person with feelings and who can eat with a fork and knife
Where was the 'abundance of caution' when this past week you made fun of Biden in front of 70,000 million debate viewers for wearing a mask.  Where was the 'abundance of caution' when you told America back in February that the virus would just disappear.

BOOM! Trump Secures ANOTHER EPIC 2020 Endorsement - Biden Loses AGAIN!  via
No doubt now that Trump knew before the debate and hoped Biden would catch it.  We know this rat, we know this is true.
Even if this newly revealed timeline is believable, it still means he was likely infectious during the debate and did not alert Biden or the attendees, and then continued to expose the public after he was diagnosed.
Was Trump's insane ranting at Biden on Tuesday caused by covid induced dementia or does he always act unhinged?
I don‚Äôt trust anything out of this administration but...why all the Repubs coming up + for Covid if it‚Äôs not real? Then again, so much is crazy to do with trump...I can‚Äôt wait to get to a Biden presidency, I just hope Trump didn‚Äôt manage to infect Biden at that trainwreck debate.
Have you actually looked at Biden‚Äôs voting record, bills he has cosponsored and Bills he wrote? Biden is a tick left of Ronald R, which is why the left is not so excited.

Did trump go to the debate knowing he had it with the intention of getting Biden infected?  Oh the narrative if they were both hospitalized.   donkey gums would be flapping a whole different story.  #TrumpVirus
I  certain they had ‚Äúlines written and ads planned ‚Äú for the moment Biden would get sick
OPINION: Some of our letter writers are suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden should skip the next debate after being constantly interrupted and thrown off by President Donald Trump.
If the situation were reversed, Trump would so be calling Biden's wife ugly and possibly flying to wherever Biden was being treated, putting a hazmat suit on, and going in to literally kick Biden while he's down.  Suspending attack ads is far better than Trump deserves.
Biden may know something we don't. If Trump dues, you don't want the optics of those ads running.
How can a proabortionist Joe Biden be an actual Catholic
Guess who's in the hospital being treated for a virus he personally downplayed? Not Biden
Especially if Biden has attended the debate knowing he was sick. I‚Äôm sure Trump knew then.

Actually it was a guess because I know people have been measured higher than 160 IQ so if Biden Is 120 than Trump is 400 do you see where I came up with this number? Mumbling &amp; bumbling Joe made me do it! So stop the insults and get on with your lives.
It's a set up.. this time thats why Joe Biden said "Proud Boys". The question this time around garanteed Trump to lose voters. No matter how he answered.
So it seems that Biden's first official act as president, despite all the important issues on his plate, will be to get the white house fumigated.
Trumps IQ is over 400. At least he not a peddler, swindler, crook and a grifter! Biden had 47 yrs. and I still can figure out what he accomplished?

They've run out of options &amp; have nothing else in their bag of tricks.  Because of his age, weight, health, if he goes on a respirator, it's not going to be an easy recovery if at all. He will not be campaigning.  Biden pulled the attack ads because he knows, he has been briefed.
That pretty well sums up how Ohio feels about Biden/Harris (Heels)?
Everyone should vote for biden for that quality alone.
He would call Biden a loser. He‚Äôd make fun of him for wearing a mask and still catching it.
I disagree. Biden has sent best wishes and has toned down anything negative in regard to Trump. That's showing true compassion and leadership. Trump's camp has already responded saying they're not dropping anything. F**k 'em. We need to win this election. There is no 2nd chance.
Biden didn't pull the ads to be nice. The campaign would be crucified if he kept running them while Trump is in the hospital.

Apparently the White House didn‚Äôt bother to let Biden know about the positive tests.
The Left makes me laugh, the Democrats keep complaining how Trump destroyed the economy. Yet where we are now is basically equal to where we were for 6 years of the Biden/Obama economy! The Left says ‚ÄúJoe is the guy to fix everything‚Äù  SERIOUSLY???
Biden should not have to pay a price for Trump‚Äôs horrific abandonment of personal responsibility.
Considering the debacle  made of the Trump/Biden fiasco, they should be willing to be a little flexible at this point, especially since the f**king president is hospitalized due to the disease the Harris camp is trying to avoid.
Shame on that Metal/Honor winner in a pro-Trump ad! He implies that Joe Biden opposed going after bin Laden. In fact, Biden thought they needed more evidence that bin Laden was actually there.  Also, considering whatüêÄüé∫thinks of the military, one wonders how he could do it.
Here is what makes me laugh, the Democrats keep complaining how Trump destroyed the economy. Yet where we are now is basically equal to where we were for 6 years of the Biden/Obama economy! The Left says ‚ÄúJoe is the guy to fix everything‚Äù  You can‚Äôt make this stuff up!!
So, Trump is going to pull the attack ads on Biden? If the positions were reversed we know how Trump would have handled it. He would have gone for Biden‚Äôs throat.
I was very relieved to find out Biden was hugging his wife, not Melania. My conspiracy brain started going and I thought they were using this as an opportunity to infect him.
Are you calling Biden captain asthma now too?  How can someone be a lifeguard and play football but dodge the draft as well because of asthma?
Why? #orangestain never does! He talked over the memory of #Biden patriotic son. #45 is a monster who lies &amp; should be treated as such
Biden killed it in Grand Rapids today.
No respect  Biden, Obama, Kamala, Pelosi ALL came out wishing "the president &amp; Melania" the very best.  The trump campaign responded by insulting them.
The epitome of class vs. crass.  (From the Washington Post:

Be Obama &amp; Biden.  Rise above it.  Let's focus on hopefully using this to demonstrate to Trump's supporters that this is very real, and that we need someone who follows science to get us out of this mess.  Not too late to wake up and do the right thing on Nov 3.
I bet they all will be voting  for Biden.
Trump wouldn‚Äôt do that so why should Biden. What a dick
He made fun of the ‚ÄúKung Flu‚Äù even calling it this name. Now he has it, the ‚ÄúKung Flu‚Äù. The guy holds rallies with thousands of people and never told them to wear masks. Made fun of Biden for wearing a big mask but he hasn‚Äôt gotten the virus. I don‚Äôt wish well to racist people.
Tulsi or Bernie easily could‚Äôve beat trump but I can‚Äôt say the same for Biden. Idk how the future looks but we can hope for nothing but positives
That is so Trump! Biden cut his negative ads but not Trump! We know who is Presidential!
Nope!
What ads will Biden have left? He better make a flurry of new ones then.

Imagine how many names Trump would be calling Biden right now if the tables were turned. Imagine how Trump would take advantage of Biden being sick.
Why? Biden wasn't the one playing with fire. Biden pulled his negative ads. The Trump campaign refuses to pull their negative ads.
I support  and her right to free speech. How many right wingers openly said the same about Joe Biden over the last 6‚É£ months‚ùì‚ùì   If the Covid was reversed, those supporting the Donald would have a field day with death memes and squealing with glee about a walkover‚ÄºÔ∏è
Small number or not,  shows Biden getting well over the 270 electoral college vote. These are different times guys than 2016. I know everyone is paranoid thinking trump will find a way to cheat etc, but you are about to see the biggest Blue landslide ever!
Yep! If the circumstances were turned around Trump would have 50 tweets out mocking and making fun of Biden.
It‚Äôs what you call voting for Biden/Harris
That‚Äôs okay, Trump campaign will make a super pac to attack him on Biden‚Äôs behalf just to call him a liar.
Biden will suspend his campaign if we wait for the next POTUS to appoint the next Supreme Court Justice.
Biden campaign taking down attack ads in wake of President Trump's COVID-19 infection
Yep this epitomizes the difference between Obama/Biden and Trump.
Yet Twitter has absolutely no problem with people who accuse the Clintons of murder or Joe Biden of being a pedophile. Others advocate for the execution of former government officials for treason. I‚Äôve reported many of them and Twitter does nothing. Perhaps  could explain.
Biden, Harris, Obama, &amp; most of the Democrat Party have wished Trump &amp; Melania well &amp; prayed for a full recovery. Biden has pulled ads bashing Trump. But lets be honest, if Biden had tested Positive, Trump would have thousands of ads bashing him as weak with hours #Karma2020
That douchebag Richard Spencer endorsed Biden and IMMEDIATELY he was denounced. Thats how Trump should do it but he doesn't like being told what to do. If he could just get out if his own ego once in a while, i might actually like the guy...
April hugs her kids a little closer and votes for Biden
Biden's not in the hospital. Oh sorry, got confused by that vague pronoun which seemed to refer back to Biden. Nah, that guy's tested negative, he's good to go.
The irony here is that the President caught a disease while serving our citizens while Biden is the disease that serves only his own family through his service.

Nah, no need to pay for attack ads when your opponent just gave the news cycle the best attack ad available. Now Biden can use that ad money for other campaign used. Looking classy is just the cherry on top. It‚Äôs business baby.
So they demanded Biden stop his supposed negative ads that show the truth about trump and then they fill the void with their lying negative ads.
You know for a guy who has the Rona, he sure looks healthier than Joe Biden.
Trump would have thrown a party if Biden tested positive. Ridiculous for Fox to even suggest suspending. It is what it is.
Yes - and DJT made fun of her. Biden should NOT stop his campaign.
So YOU got trumps message.. STAND !!  Where you going when Biden WINS ??   We coming We coming strong.. That's a Threat ???  Poor Losers !!
Because Biden is a decent human being. It will be a refreshing change to have that in the white house.
I am so ready for a dialing down of the hysteria that as been 4 years of this dysfunctional presidency. President Biden will behave with class and dignity. I can‚Äôt wait!

Why?  The ads about trump show the truth, not lies like trump‚Äôs ads about Biden.   They show the incompetence and failures of the trump regime, including his disregard for the seriousness of the pandemic which has gotten him to where he is now.
Oh yeah.
If the worst happens, Biden doesn't want attack ads running -- bad optics. He also saves $$. It's not like Trump is going to come back from this &amp; win or serve at 74, obese, etc. Likely, he is going on a respirator. There is no more campaign, unless Trump is faking. It's over.

Trump hoped Biden would get his rona at the debate and that Biden would get sick and die. 100% what went down
HELL NO he was irresponsible and failed the AMERICAN people. Biden showed TRUE LEADERSHIP following strict protocols for safe campaigning #BidenHarris2020Landslide
HELL NO Biden has followed strict protocols to ensure the safety of those around him.  Biden shows TRUE LEADERSHIP #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Maybe that‚Äôs why he was talking so much. He wanted to infect Biden.
Joe Biden is a better person than I am. I cannot say that I was unhappy to hear this latest news regarding Trump &amp; his family. Quite frankly I hope they all come down with it &amp; it takes them all out!
Biden-mask,no virus.......trump no mask lots of people at rallies positive for virus  ....... you failed science correct?
And Obama/Biden were recovering from a GIGANTIC GOP fuck over of the economy! Remember the systemic crash of 2008? That's you fuckers who did that.
Well it is what it is, right?!! What goes around comes around and it will be 10 fold!! Making fun of Biden for wearing that big ass mask, is not so funny anymore!! Is it??

Are you a real person?.......why do you wear seatbelts?...... why do you follow the rules in any circumstance?..... it‚Äôs a pretty good clue masks work?..... Biden no virus..... trump has the virus and they don‚Äôt believe in masks
Going for the low hanging fruit with the DB article.  ‚ÄùHowever, Biden did use language that was similar.‚Äù Receipts?  And the alternative for us is...
It very well does. Biden wants to say he can protect us all .. how ? Trump is actually trying to protect us with the curfew , mandatory shut downs , masks .. he‚Äôs not a doctor but he is trying to help the most he can. I had covid 19 and so did my man. It‚Äôs nothing to play with.
You know damn well that tr*mp would be making fun of Biden &amp; not care at all if it was the other way around
Another question, would trump? Yo know he wouldn't. He brought it on himself, Biden didn't.
Wallace is a puppet...Biden is a clone
Biden might not have a problem with that if Trump agrees to no negative tweets or ads from him or his campaign during the same time frame.
Oh unclutch ur pearls, Trump's a POS who mocks anyone for anything, nothing is off-limits to him. Biden tweeted him well-wishes hours ago hoping for a speedy recovery. Me? I hope it drags, like it did for all the uninsured ppl who suffered bc of his shit response &amp; covid rallies

We deserve proof of  COVID test. We deserve proof of when he found out he had it/was exposed to it.   We cannot put it past him to find out he was positive, and go to the debate anyway just to risk Biden. He is that person. Timing is convenient #TrumpHasCovid
Shake your head all you want. My response had absolutely nothing to do with Kamala Harris, Biden, or guns. You seem to be opinionated in the wrong place.
Then, Biden could still win handily.
Biden is not the president (yet) and he was in his house, just like the majority of responsible Americans (and humans) while trump was scared of a few people outside the white house.  You know Nixon actually went out and talked to protesters.
Assuming Dem voters come out, Biden might lose some never Trump GOP voters who return to Pence, but would that give GOP the executive?
My point being:  It ain't over till it's over.  (I do hope Biden wins in a landslide, but it's hard to trust the polls after what happened in 2016, and also hard to not be concerned about Biden completely blowing it.)
The Democratic nominees for president and vice president will travel to the state on Oct. 8.
If election were held today, Biden wins in a landslide. But, we still have a month to go. POTUS tests positive for covid, how much sympathy support will he get? If they have a 2nd debate, Trump lets Biden talk, and Biden spews forth one of his trademarked incoherent word salads?
That‚Äôs how I took it- like Biden did
Joe Biden and wife Jill Biden tested negative for coronavirus
You are late to the party.  It all started at the debate when Biden asked Trump nicely to please close his mouth for a second or two.
Biden and Kamala have both tested negative today.
I have NO sympathy whatsoever! It‚Äôs his own fault. He called it a hoax. He wanted states liberated. He mocked Biden for wearing a mask.  Biden should continue his safe campaigning. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Mr. Biden, sir, may I respectfully request you stay away from crowds for the rest of the year, and even into next year? You have our votes, and nothing‚Äôs changing that. Do your victory speech and inauguration online. We‚Äôll need you when it‚Äôs safe again.
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Biden shows he is a true leader by following strict protocols during his campaign! Unlike Rump who shows no leadership qualities and has failed to protect the AMERICAN people.
Biden says he tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday #BIDENtestsNegative
Trial? If Biden wins, they'll just give him immunity like Obama did for GWB. A trial will just expose the entire corrupt system that is our "democracy".
Big Mask Biden said not today, not now, not ever.
Biden And Harris wish The Trumps A Swift Recovery even though #Trump family and staff were maskless at and endangered #Biden and others at the  #PresidentialDebate2020 Is it a hoax ?#FakeNews  or is it real since  #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks #TrumpHasCovid
The rate of infection among household members when a family member tests positive is reported to be 11% in one study, at 16% in another. So, even after exposure, the odds are ever in one's favor. There's a very very good chance that Biden does not have it, even if Trump does.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, tested negative for coronavirus on Friday morning.
Would the Republican Party be allowed to select a new candidate before the meeting of the Electoral College? Will we have a simple Biden-Harris victory? 2/2
Biden testing negative is such a flex. Love it
Now that the White Supremacy House has been tainted by tRump - what else can we do but VOTE &amp; look for a 'clean' location for our new President Biden?
Biden tests negative for COVID-19.
Unfortunately you‚Äôre probably right and if he gets sick and dies I‚Äôm sure it will be because Biden breathe on him... let‚Äôs hope no one dies
If he gets tested in 5 to 8 days again (which is when he's *most* likely to test positive) then we can all sigh in relief. Until then, the only fear this assuages is that Biden is on top of his status, which is all that can be done.
Despicable is a good word to describe trump and his team. There is no care for Biden or the rest of this country, only for what trump wants.

The mask I wear today will remind me to pray for the health of the President and First Lady and will honor them.  The beads I often wear, like Biden, will be a prayer for him and the health of the nation. We can all mask up in solemn unity.

Biden and Harris react to the news that Mr. Trump and his Wife have tested Positive for COVID¬†19

If big Joe Biden was president then Mr. Trump would most likely not have contracted the virus. Masks and distancing work. Right now the potus Should be eating a giant piece of humble pie and telling the American people how important it is to wear a mask and distance.
Biden was Obama's VP dumbass. Both wanted to cut SS. Go back to sleep like the rest of the Dems were before Trump was POTUS while Pelosi and the rest of the House Dems vote for Trump's bills.

Trump‚Äôs campaign never bothered to contact Biden‚Äôs campaign about COVID exposure
I'm beginning to worry about Biden, a bit. We should have heard by now what his test result is.
Excuse me, what?  What Trump does or what's happening to Trump is of no consequence whatsoever to Biden.  Why would you suggest that unless you wanted Trump to win?  No Biden might have to isolate because he was exposed to Trump, that's it.
Biden‚Äôs campaign is suspended as it is. He‚Äôs called a lid on 80% of the days in September... what campaign? It‚Äôs in suspension lol
Here‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîIF he gets really ill or dies (I don‚Äôt rejoice in this prospect for anyone including him), doesn‚Äôt that mean Pence takes his place? Pence could very well win over Biden...
Today pussies on the Right will cry that the left is evil for what they say about Trump. Next week the pussies on the left will cry that the right is evil for what they say when Biden has it. Both sides are pussies and hypocrites.
I would scoff, until I see the absolute hate from leftists aimed at our president. I might wish justice upon Joe Biden, but never the kind of schitt these people wish on  &amp;  I pray for theirs and anyone else with COVID's swift recovery.
A town hall kinda changes the dynamics. Questions come from voters, not a moderator. I don‚Äôt see him being rude to voters. Even interrupting Biden when a VOTER is asking the question, seems unlikely. He‚Äôd at least have to reign it in.  But you‚Äôre right, his supporters are solid.
Wouldn't it be hilarious if both Trump AND Biden got the virus and died before the election?  WHOO!! Pandemonium!
I hope you and the Biden‚Äôs are ok! That‚Äôs what we are hoping for!
Well I think Trump NEEDS a good debate performance. His numbers are in the toilet. Biden is sort of on cruise control. Either way, I think only Trump has motive to do it.  But he‚Äôs a hard head, so we shall see.
Pretty clever way to get out of debating Biden again.
No suspending Biden campaign. They have been following protocol.  Even at the debate. They need to continue on. There isn‚Äôt 1 Republican that hasn‚Äôt been asking for this virus with their sloppy  exposures to everyone. To HELL with them
What did he expect? He has been flying all over having rallies- unmasked and with no social distancing. The contact tracing is gonna be a shit show. I hope Biden is ok.
Mild symptoms as of Wed. And I think debates are likely off. He probably won‚Äôt agree to a virtual debate, and if I were Biden campaign, I sure wouldn‚Äôt agree to a town hall format. It‚Äôs only 12 days away.
The campaign has not said where in Arizona Biden and Harris will appear for their first stop in the state of the campaign.
Biden needs to test now and again in a few days. Taking a test soon after exposure can produce a negative test result, even if you have it.
Honestly, Biden and his campaign staff from Tuesday night, they will all have to be tested and maybe even quarantined as well.
Unfortunately, I doubt he does actually have it.  He is pulling a PR stunt so we stop talking about taxes, proud boys, Melania's tapes, ACB's appointment to the SCOTUS, etc... now he can not debate Biden and be a hydroxycloroquine hero. So much winning! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The president, is an asshole. Plain and simple. He has NO RESPECT and does not give a crap about Joe Biden, you, me or anyone else. Respect is EARNED, and so is hate.
That was my thought, too. Then I started worrying about Joe Biden on the same stage and how far droplets travel from a ranting mouth.
Joe Biden needs to cease this moment while he can. Control the narrative. Show leadership, express the importance of mask wearing and hand washing and make an example out of Donald Dump.
Get the morning's latest developments on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump testing positive for the coronavirus.
Which he has done numerous times through out his political life! Now hound Biden until he condemns , ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù, all white supremacists including his ‚ÄúMentor‚Äù former exulted grand cyclops Byrd !
Very nice elaboration there KAREN! You really ran with that one. Best summary of fake bullshit I've seen in a while! BTW, what the fuck does your stupid comment have to do with Mr. Biden wishing President Trump well???
So who's in charge of antifa? Do you have a phone number or HR contact? Maybe an organizational website?
The Trump does not have Covid. If none of them are masking up, it is because Trump is lying to get out debating Biden and going to a town hall where he will have to pretend to care about what the so-called undecided people think.
Former Vice President Joe Biden on #POTUS and #FLOTUS #COVID19 diagnosis
I will believe it when one of the Bedminster people turns up sick in 3 days. He posed for pics with people when he was positive and had no mask. If they show up sick, I will believe it. Bonus points if they are pissed and voting Biden.
Biden: ‚ÄúJill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.‚Äù
OPINION: There is no debate ‚Äî our letter writers are steamed after witnessing the first 2020 Presidential Debate, with most heaping their ire on President Trump and Vice President Biden for the debacle.
Biden tweets well-wishes to Trumps, says he is praying for 'the health and safety' of family.
Their recklessness should not be a factor for Biden.
. .  Scully ought to be disqualified!!  Trump campaign calls out second debate moderator who interned for Biden, worked for Ted Kennedy. UNBELIEVABLE.    #FoxNews
.  . 'It's no coincidence!' Joe Biden's brother Frank finally agrees to pay some of the $1M he owes family of young father killed in a horrific car crash 20 years ago as election draws near - after dodging creditors for decades
JUST IN: First response from Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden on POTUS &amp; FLOTUS testing positive for COVID-19
Let me think on that a minute....what would Trump do?  Full speed ahead....Is it Biden's fault that he didn't protect himself?
We are all Joe Biden.

Wait? Thought the ü¶† was a hoax? It was 15, soon to be 1. Would go away by April, go away when it is warm. It would magicallyüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è disappear. You coerced those around you NOT to wear üò∑  You mock Joe Biden for wearing a üò∑ the üêì has come to roost!!!
What a sleaze, just like the rest of the Biden‚Äôs.
I'm worried about the Biden's. Praying that both are healthy and safe.
y‚Äôall realize that in all 47 years that Biden has been in politics he has been a racist against black people lmao
Crazy how big Don was making of of Biden for wearing masks 3 nights ago huh
Republicans better hope Mike Pence hasn‚Äôt been exposed, or we could have acting President Pelosi until Biden‚Äôs Inauguration in January. #COVID19 #Election2020 #TrumpCovid #Pelosi
the moment the lying clown Biden said "shut up" the fake news moderator dildo wallace should have held him accountable, PERIOD.
Biden voter.
Biden voter.
So what burden does Wallace own for the lack of balls to hold Biden accountable for his 47 year failed political career and Biden‚Äôs horrible future policies?
Lol I hear ya. Biden has some real finesse the way he sniffs little girls. Sorry im not into ex vice presidents pedos...
I understand they are more deserving.  I have always taken COVID-19 very seriously. Read my tweets. I am not a Trump fan. If Joe Biden had become infected with COVID-19 I doubt that Trump would wish him a speedy recovery, but let‚Äôs not descend to his level.
This is perfect. They should do the next debate over zoom so they can mute him when Biden is speaking.
Here is one of the proud boys that Biden and that moderator tried to feed you as "white supremacy".  shocker? Its a black man. Proud Boys = Patriots who love thier country.
It would be the sweetest moment. Though I have a feeling she'd hold it open and let president Biden make the nomination.
Through electoral rules, the election goes ahead even though Biden &amp; Trump are both in comas. A "write-in Sanders" movement takes the US by storm causing electoral chaos. He wins by a landslide, only to lose to Trump in court because 15% of voters spelled his name Berny.
I don‚Äôt think VP Joe Biden should agree to do another debate! Frankly, Americans have made up their minds it is not worth exposing oneself to Covid19. That goes for  with everyone around the president May have tested positive. I prayüôè
You're correct.   I'm also just concerned about Biden right now.
I can‚Äôt say  is wrong but I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs likely either.  Most likely is pence vs Biden or pence vs Kamala
Note to Biden campaign: yes, yes I am available for employment üòÇüòÇ
Indeed. Hopefully Biden is okay.
Biden's new ad against tRump:   He can't even keep himself safe. How the hell can you trust him to keep America safe?
The issue is we don't know when Trump actually got infected yet. I just hope Biden gets tested a lot in the coming days and has a plan in place in case symptoms appear.  I'm not a religious person but I'll be keeping the Bidens and their team in my thoughts.
If anything Harris is more to the left than Biden is, so you'd think it'd be better to them. They'll still complain because she isn't Bernie.
Then Trump had to quarantine for as many days the Biden campaign called for a lid in September alone... ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Just saw something in a tweet I hadn't considered yet.  Two nights ago he was standing 8-10 ft. away from Biden for 90 minutes.  Oh boy.
Biden. I‚Äôm stoked!
My candidate is not Biden, Vladimir, and don‚Äôt worry, Putin doesn‚Äôt have to know you can‚Äôt comprehend English good.
"The Proud Boys" are blacks and hispanics who love america. They are not white supremacist that you think they are. Also again.. I would like to say that moderator in the debate is Joe Biden's campaign manager.. rigged against Trump much?
Because it shows corruption. Joe Biden had the connections to give him that job in the first place. He was just vice president with that judgement imagine what he would do as president. He was highly under qualified. It was his first job ever and he was given MILLIONS of dollars
Both of them can suck eggs, but at least Biden doesn‚Äôt hate gay people and believes that science is real.  I‚Äôm pretty sure Americans are gonna take the science believer over the guy who thinks injecting bleach is a cure.
Bank statements? That shouldn't be considered as truth? Joe Biden has been caught on camera saying he was caught in these foreign affairs
Has anyone thought to test Biden? After all he was just in the same room as Trump.
Joy, separation itself isn't an absolute protection. The smallest airborne droplets, we now believe, can stay in the air for hours. Biden is almost certainly at risk here.
It's also just better for the country if Trump lives and Biden beats him in the election.
Watch Biden test positive tomorrow tho. Peak 2020.
Worried about Biden though.
Unfortunately he was still at risk. The six foot rule isn't really accurate. You can catch it up to 15 feet away depending on ventilation.  We need to hope Biden is okay.
Anyone else a little worried Biden hasent tweeted yet?
He has put 200,000+ in the grave by advocating for the very behavior that got him where he is. He has reveled in being as vile as he possibly can be even in the face of others' tragedies (Biden's son?). He's a bully and a narcissist. Sometimes you get what you pay for.
Well this disease has killed 200,000+ Americans after all so here's hoping
I can't believe he exposed Biden to the virus.
Unfortunately the incubation period means Biden probably can't get accurately tested til Sunday at the earliest.
Not to mention if Trump gets really sick and he has to invoke the 25th amendment. If he gets really sick, Biden might consider suspending his campaign. How it will affect the election? The next couple of weeks are gonna be interesting........
Does President Pelosi get to pick the next SCOTUS seat or will we go ahead and wait for President Biden? #TrumpHasCovid #ItIsWhatItIs
The Biden campaign should immediately start running ads with Trump mocking Biden for wearing masks and the tweet admitting that he has Covid.
Biden has been in his basement there's no way he can contract Covid let alone give it to anybody else. Plus they didn't even touch each other at the debate
Excuse me? BIDEN IS IN GOOD HEALTH ..Nice and slim not obese and all the other things he's  hiding Plus he wear a mask..
I KNOW!  So much for campaigning. And with 33 days. Also if I were Biden, I‚Äôd tell Trump it‚Äôs a virtual debate or nothing.
ALRIGHT!  This is big! Biden &amp; the Democrats won't support School Choice. Funny, they have no problem funding death to kill off our next generation in the womb but they hate School Choice. Trump reauthorized the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program for 4 more years!
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris to make campaign appearance in Arizona
Wait, so does this mean that Biden had to quarantine too? They were just together on Tuesday.
Yes, Biden is a pathological liar.  I think all of us have known one or two in our lives.  They don't realize they are lying and if they are confronted, they are in disbelief that you have called them out on their blatant lies. Sad thing is, they believe themselves.
I hope Biden is safe. Trump was screaming, how much spit did he spew?
A zoom presidential debate would be Hilarious like hear me out,  imagine trump interrupting Biden and the Moderator mutes him imagine how mad he‚Äôll get üò≠üò≠üò≠
Do you think he spit on biden?
You will have plenty of company, lol! But did he give it to Biden at debate????
3/Biden's policies will encourage outsourcing, destroy our economy, forced unionization, abolish Right-To-Work Laws, defund School Choice, that POC wants to 2X the number of psychologists, social workers, other useless Ph.d's to put kids on Ritalin or something just as bad.
ok but trump was just right next to biden the other night so don‚Äôt get too excited ladies and gents
Jesus Christ these responses are horrific. This is the nation‚Äôs greatest president who will overcome this flu like symptom.. Biden‚Äôs old ass would die. Trump will overcome and be perfectly fine because this is a made up hoax and he will have flu symptoms for a couple days
is probably just putting up a front so he can postpone his next debate!!! If he has symptoms, it might just be a head cold because he is ‚Äúso stressed‚Äù if he is... well he shouldn‚Äôt have made fun of Biden for wearing one!!!
real talk whos more hung biden or trump ? urgent im at the polls
Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt have to pray the Mi Shebeirach for Joe Biden.
I have to assume Biden didn't come near any of Trump's people, I hope.
When the spectators walked in, I noticed the Trump crowd had no masks bit the Biden crowd did.

Just means no more debates, probably. I can't see it having a strong negative or positive effect for either candidate. I'm more just worried about Biden, since Trump was shouting jusr a few feet away.

I'm just worried he gave it to Biden.
Remember a couple days ago when trump was trying to talk that shit about Biden wearing his mask everywhere??  üòÖüòÇü§£
He did a lot of spit-yelling on Tuesday night. Biden might have it, too?
Let‚Äôs hope Joe Biden stays healthy.
you don‚Äôt understand narcissists, it gains him everything. he also gets to not debate biden again.
Unfortunately, contact tracing links him to Joe &amp; Jill Biden üò≥üò≥üò≥
Let him sit in a clinic and wait his turn.
his sycophants love talking about how healthy and strong he is. üôÉ biden is sleepy and weak right but trump beat the virus.
I‚Äôm concerned about the Biden family. None of the Trump kids or his staff were wearing masks at the debate.
I do feel like my life depends on it so I am voting for Trump. Sorry Beetlejuice but Joe Biden Kamala Harris and all the rest of you democrats are all losers. Literally.
Some where, there is a Biden joke yelling "Will you just die man!"   #WillYouJustDieMan
Actually, Julian, what we need is Joe Biden as president and an end to this travesty of leadership nightmare known as Donald Trump. We‚Äôve had enough.
If they die Joe Biden is pretty much guaranteed a win right
Joe Biden was forced to attempt a controlled, professional debate with a baboon on meth. Give me a f**king break. Judge Biden on his policies and track record.
It will be spun as a massive leftwing conspiracy to kill Trump. Or for those who still don't believe in covid or masks,  they will think Hillary or Hunter Biden poisoned him.
Love it!!
Doesn‚Äôt Biden need to quarantine too?  Lots of Covid droplets were screamed into that room on Tuesday
üëÄ what was that about shitting on Biden for always wearing a mask? lmaooo
BIDEN!! This shit can get super crazy in  heartbeat!!
Funny how you made fun of Biden for always wearing a mask!
Holy shit.  Would Biden have to quarantine too?
And here‚Äôs where I panic wait for Biden to be tested.
Is Biden okay?
Remember that one time you tried roasting Biden over wearing a mask all the time during a pandemic??
Trump's latest punt on White supremacy shows a debate rebound will be tough
He‚Äôs spewed germs all over Biden, his family refused to wear masks at the debate and when was he last with Amy Coney Barrett?
Bob Woodward: We now have a constitutional problem
Double plot twist: If Trump has the coof now, that means he was infected during the debate. Biden gets it too, and they both die. Hillary steps in.
Chris Wallace blames Trump for chaotic debate: He 'bears the primary responsibility'
The worst thing for me personally is to be told I am a liar. Trump doesn't take that kind of crap from anybody. Biden drew first blood.  Not the President.
A Debate That Can‚Äôt Be Ignored
That's true, but if he was contagious then we have to remember his yelling generates way more aerosolized droplets than normal speech. Some of that can stay airborne for some time. The distance between them wouldn't provide 100% protection for Biden.
#Repost  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Your first look at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. #SNLPremiere
I think knowing the odds are stacked against him motivates President Trump even more. Trump is a fighter and he will most likely end up embarrassing both Biden and Scully if the fix is in.
Nor me. If Biden‚Äôs wins and these thugs try to cause unrest they should be held under the same standards as anybody. If they break any laws or cause harm to anyone, round them and throw them in jail.
Yeah who knew science was real...  Like I said. Biden was at risk for 90 mins. Put the guy in a bubble and lock up the #OrangeAnus for 2 weeks.
I think this is what Trump wanted.A debate so bad that nobody would want to watch another one.What does he have to brag about.He doesn‚Äôt want Biden to expose more of his bullshit either
I think his instant test was positive and he‚Äôs waiting for the more comprehensive test. Notice that news reporters broke the story about Hope Hicks not the WH. My only concern is for Joe Biden and others at the debate.
Trump mocks Biden for wearing masks: 'Every time you see him, he's got a mask'
You husband just called out Biden‚Äôs son for having an addiction during a national debate.
Wouldn't that be great? Lol he would have to sit &amp; watch Biden from his TV! ü§£ü§£ü§£
Most Biden supporters don‚Äôt know which country the flag on the right belongs to. Why would they, since Joe can‚Äôt even complete the ‚ÄúPledge of Allegiance‚Äù!
The cash-on-hand is where the even bigger difference will be. I bet Biden will have $300-400 million more cash-on-hand than the Trump campaign.
Joe Biden is as out of touch with the ‚Äúeveryday person‚Äù as Cheeto Man is #VoteLibertarian #VoteGold2020
Best guess: $160 million. Biden $375 million Trump $215 million
Of course you do. I thought you were ill-prepared and empty of any real content. Platitudes and catch phrases of the most generic style. You weren‚Äôt confident, you were spiteful and you are not smart. Bye-bye Biden.
Kinda goes against his narrative that the virus isn't a big deal, though. He must be really scared of Biden.
If he gets hit he will hit back twice as hard. As was pointed out, Biden started it so Trump finished it. Need a tissue?

Biden's "life in the fast lane" debate makes for a crash (or lid as called by his campaign). And so the song mimics life = "surely make you lose your mind"
just some advice, have Kenneth Copeland blow you. He claims he could blow Covid away. Still talking shit about Biden wearing a mask?
They are so evil that you really have to consider the possibility that they knew she was positive and were hoping Biden would get infected.
I suppose this could be Biden's free get-out-of-debates card.

People familiar with stuttering explain why Biden's debate performance was extraordinary - #bravo #JoeBiden
But here is an answer for ya. Literally voting Joe Biden is you in pen writing down the name who used the police to go after black people and the man is proud of that.
So if Biden wins this dumbass is literally already admitting that he will start a war. #Traitor much?   #2020Election
That's precisely the moral courage we've come to expect from Trumpists.  Tbf, though, I'm hanging Trump around his neck for the rest of his life even if he does vote for Biden.
But have more former Trump admin officials endorsed Biden than Trump?
Joe Biden was a disgrace. I felt his vulgar name calling and telling you to shut up showed his true colors. I felt you won, but the left will not, of course, agree. Please do everything you can to win and save this great country.
You hit the nail on the head.  We cannot be silent.  This is the most critical election I‚Äôve ever a part of. Trump wins, we win. Biden wins, kiss this country goodbye.
You‚Äôre right. President Trump has denounced terrorist groups DOZENS of times. Hiden Biden is saying a lie time after time trying to make people believe it‚Äôs the truth
Listening to Mark Levin this evening he made it perfectly clear that the Democrats with Biden in office will pack the SCOTUS and they will destroy this country and our constitution. It‚Äôs all about power for them and the American citizen can kiss it all goodbye.
#Biden is practically Gerald Ford. Everybody knows this.

Excellent! I do hope Biden shows up and uses the full time to talk about his policies.
'it Biden isn't it'.......???????
I'm just concerned about if he gave it to Biden, but I guess he wouldn't have been contagious yet.
How is this projection? Have you not seen the VIDEO of Biden at Byrd's funeral? Or the picture of him holding hands with the guy? Smh. üôÑ

This is from a Twitter survey that allowed anyone to vote and invite their friends to, as well.  Better stick with plan A, try to steal the election.
I want Joe Biden to be exactly how he was. Decent. Not descending to the Orangeman‚Äôs level. Laughing at trump‚Äôs b.s. was good. And the occassional exasperated ‚Äúshut up‚Äù was perfect.
Well,  that and they're trying to lump his entire voting block into the same mold, thinking that we'll have to prove that we're not S'premicists by voting for Biden. It's all really aimed at us.
It's really a scary moment for this country. I want to see all these f*ckers in prison when Biden takes over.

CJ, I have never said and I‚Äôm not saying that he has not fucked up royally in the past. Surely Biden has. I am saying is that I would rather bet on a man who isn‚Äôt that way now than a man who is thinking twice before denouncing white supremacy.
Ahhh, they don‚Äôt. Just because your guy ended up looking terrible, it wasn‚Äôt Chris Wallace‚Äôs fault. Trump was rude, overbearing &amp; dragged Biden‚Äôs children into it. Biden has so much more class than that poor excuse for a man. He‚Äôs not just a bad president, he‚Äôs a bad human being.
Thie idea of Kelly and Biden being linked to Antifa is hilarious. But apparently, as a "Christian," you're OK with the president using a violent white supremacist gang to help him destroy our democracy. #WWJD

Biden did a great job of holding it together even when tRump started hitting below the belt about his sons.
Trying yet again to make a one sided issue. Biden supports law abiding Americans, citizen or cop. If a law enforcement officer is acting in an illegal manner, that is their failure &amp; should be punished. It is not a blanket failure. Fix what 8s broken, keep the rest.
What will you say when Biden is in the WH‚ùì‚ùì The typical "he cheated" sour grapes, or will you finally grow up and take some responsibility that you did not work for your candidate and that is why you lost...
Biden is a racist. He always has been.
While your pounding Roberts on the back,Where‚Äôs the legitimate questions to Biden about his actual racist history?
No because Trump doesn't but you people as usual are fine with Biden's decades long denigration of blacks and minorities because you talk about them like that when you think no one is listening.
Biden, Trump endorse CD2 candidates.
Hmm so it‚Äôs Trumps fault Chris Wallace protected Biden? It‚Äôs Trumps fault Wallace refused to push Biden to explain his future policies? Nice

Didn't her husband attack Biden's son Tuesday night because he recovered from cocaine addiction?
"Trump could not be stopped on Tuesday. He snarled, bellowed and pawed the earth, and when that wasn‚Äôt working, he did something genuinely chilling. He called out for Nazi reinforcements."
That is OK.  If he debated Wallace and Biden in the first debate, he can certainly handle Biden and his next assistant. But the question remains who debated Trump better: Wallace or Biden?
Further proof Biden has dementia or is getting mixed signals electronically
I guarantee that someone will ask him a question he can't answer or doesn't like and he is going to call Aunt Mimi from Iowa a "nasty woman" or something. It won't be like attacking Biden or Pelosi, but an innocent voter.  Trump absolutely MUST control his worst impulses. As if.
Give me a break.  I think Biden kept quiet for most of the ugly onslaught.  I‚Äôm tired of 45‚Äôs comments on Biden‚Äôs kids.  45‚Äôs kids are carbon copies of himself and reside in the sewer.

We‚Äôre not stupid. We noticed. We don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre ready to vote! As my favorite bumper sticker says ‚ÄúBiden/Harris..Ugh...It‚Äôs Fine‚Äù
But he was debating the moderator! How could Biden possibly win?
Biden missed a layup as well, when Trump said you don't leave 128 judgeships open, to which the obvious answer is you do when McConnell is slow walking them. and I was disappointed, but did not feel personally betrayed.
Your right! Under Biden the economy will collapse.

it's amazing how quickly we forgot about Trump's not paying taxes, owing $400M, extorting Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Biden, putting kids in cages, intentionally hobbling the US Postal Service, and being morally (and financially) bankrupt.
Biden looks like that Clint Howard alien from the old Star Trek show..."Tranya!"
I have a list of all Biden's lies. Every time he opened his mouth. Thankfully the moderator was there to talk for old pedo Biden when he got confused and lost.
‚ÄúIn Joe Biden's America, we'd all be in danger.‚Äù Translation: Trump and his Administration officials will be in danger of prosecution. Hey #MAGA2020 folks, this loser is still your guy? #VoteBidenHarris2020 üá∫üá∏
Partisan Presidential Debate Commission trying to further place their thumb on debate rules to favor weakling Joe Biden.  I wonder if Putin would change rules in an international negation with a weakened President Biden --God forbid!!
And make sure you ask Biden to do it 25 times!
Voting for Biden in Arizona.
We need to hear from presidential candidates about their plans to address the $1.7 trillion #studentdebtcrisis. Tell the next #Debates moderators,   and   to ask  and  about student debt!!!
Trump's whole game plan was to get Biden to stutter.

Biden earned even more respect from me for telling him to shut up.
Biden's list is longer!
Agree.  If Biden wins all the blue states will take credit for ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù and open and CV will magically disappear.  Orange man will still be bad and they will shame red states saying they could have saved more lives.
They've had enough of  Republican Party will never change. They are not working for Americans anymore, just greed and money, big Corp. and the rich.
is a loaf. Crazy people vote biden. Like main in voting that democrats will through in trash also Republicans will trash democrat ballots. Best way go in person Vote. #Trump2020
I mean he definitely stood up next to Monica lol üòÇ Apart from that I don‚Äôt know much about him to comment. I know more about Biden and the impeached president so I comment on that.
Biden can‚Äôt really do a national lockdown, unless he invokes the interstate commerce clause, which would be extreme even for the Dems. Per the 10th Amendment, he can‚Äôt shut states down.  Red state govs like Noem and DeSantis will tell him to go F himself. Blue states can implode.

Hard to take her as being seriously concerned about this subject when her husband and Jr repeatedly attack Hunter Biden. This is a PR stunt to try to make up for their behavior.
I agree with Rick Wilson that Biden should show up with a folding deck chair, a six pack of beer, and his sunglasses. He should sit down, pop open a cold one, get his sunglasses just right and tell Donnie, ‚ÄúDig your hole Donnie, dig it deep‚Äù.

in the morning I look into the USA mirror and see hard working good people, u see Pelosi, Clinton, Biden, Schumer, Bernie and the fugly squad trying to make this country into Venezuela or Greece! when the Right decides it is time, then the left will go down like a crack whore!The politicians and civil servants do not like President Trump because he is not one of them. Biden is a nincompoop that was a lap dog for Obama for 8 years. He is a non-op.
Trump never wore a mask, and neither did anyone around him. He got Covid at the Rose Garden last Saturday. Spread it to everyone. Biden and those wearing masks tested negative. Proof masks work.
I have been  solicited 4 times by text to register in GA where I have not lived or voted in the last 3 years I have read Biden plans to SEND people Door to door in Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states TO HELP PEOPLE VOTE? But there WILL BE NOFRAUD THEY PROMISE!! DAH!!
Biden CLAIMED, Without challenge from debate moderator, Registered Democrat, Chis Wallace, that obama did better! (haha) and that "THEY" left office with a Booming economy? I guess We all were in a different economy! Or maybe he meant the 150 mill obama LEFT WITH? (after taxes)
I would encourage the exposure of This Women's RADICAL ideas and Previous record in the context of the current potential crisis of Presidents illness. Emphasizing JUST how important the VP position CAN BE. Compare HER to Pence! Its obvious Biden wont last 4 years if elected.
Biden interrupted Trump first 3 times . video doesn't lie Christy!
We most certainly do.......we don‚Äôt need that lying, plagiarizing fool, Biden. He needs to stay in his bunker !!
Trump thought Covid was a joke. He thought Biden was a joke. Who got the last laugh?
Barack and Michelle have as have the Biden‚Äôs.
Trump would have thrown a party if Biden tested positive. Ridiculous for Fox to even suggest suspending. It is what it is.
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? YOU ARE UNDERESTIMATING  In 10 days he will test NEGATIVE AND MEET BIDEN FOR SECOND DEBATE ON THE 15th! COVID-19 DOES VERY LITTLE DAMAGE TO HEALTHY PEOPLE!
BREAKING: Joe Biden &amp; wife, Jill, test negative for #COVID19.
Keep in MIND the MODERATOR is a Registered Democrat! The Next debate moderator Worked for Biden in 3 previous campaigns! It's Here on twitter SEEK and you WILL FIND. Just how GD Bias the Media really IS.
A town hall kinda changes the dynamics. Questions come from voters, not a moderator. I don‚Äôt see him being rude to voters. Even interrupting Biden when a VOTER is asking the question, seems unlikely. He‚Äôd at least have to reign it in.  But you‚Äôre right, his supporters are solid.
Well I think Trump NEEDS a good debate performance. His numbers are in the toilet. Biden is sort of on cruise control. Either way, I think only Trump has motive to do it.  But he‚Äôs a hard head, so we shall see.
Mild symptoms as of Wed. And I think debates are likely off. He probably won‚Äôt agree to a virtual debate, and if I were Biden campaign, I sure wouldn‚Äôt agree to a town hall format. It‚Äôs only 12 days away.
Unfortunately, I doubt he does actually have it.  He is pulling a PR stunt so we stop talking about taxes, proud boys, Melania's tapes, ACB's appointment to the SCOTUS, etc... now he can not debate Biden and be a hydroxycloroquine hero. So much winning! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Which he has done numerous times through out his political life! Now hound Biden until he condemns , ‚Äúunequivocally‚Äù, all white supremacists including his ‚ÄúMentor‚Äù former exulted grand cyclops Byrd !
Biden won. Hands down.
I understand they are more deserving.  I have always taken COVID-19 very seriously. Read my tweets. I am not a Trump fan. If Joe Biden had become infected with COVID-19 I doubt that Trump would wish him a speedy recovery, but let‚Äôs not descend to his level.
Excuse me? BIDEN IS IN GOOD HEALTH ..Nice and slim not obese and all the other things he's  hiding Plus he wear a mask..
I KNOW!  So much for campaigning. And with 33 days. Also if I were Biden, I‚Äôd tell Trump it‚Äôs a virtual debate or nothing.
You will have plenty of company, lol! But did he give it to Biden at debate????
I do feel like my life depends on it so I am voting for Trump. Sorry Beetlejuice but Joe Biden Kamala Harris and all the rest of you democrats are all losers. Literally.
It will be spun as a massive leftwing conspiracy to kill Trump. Or for those who still don't believe in covid or masks,  they will think Hillary or Hunter Biden poisoned him.
BIDEN!! This shit can get super crazy in  heartbeat!!
Would you have rather have Hannity instead ? A Biden Hater ?
You did a lousy job of manipulating the picture of Joe. Where are your sources for your allegation that Biden made 33 false or misleading claims? And how about the hundreds of lies Trump told?
Biden is leading in all the polls. America backs Biden, not the lying Russian puppet.

Biden crushed you.  You know it.  You just can‚Äôt handle it.
A tidal wave of support for Joe Biden.
H.P Not a PEEP about the WIRE Biden was wearing? Went from "He wasnt wearing 1" To "It was rosary Beads" After THEY SAW the video's. If you Watched the debate You can See Joe waiting and listening before he answers! Agree To Wire ck and drug screens before NEXT DEBATE I Dare u
Hey Do YOU KNOW Trump will END SANCTUARY CITIES and is FOR TERM LIMITS? Do you think Dem's Like those ideas? Did you KNOW Biden plans WIDE OPEN BORDERS and to REPEAL all the TAX Reductions Trump put into place? Know when YOU GOOGLE that THEY DONATE HUGE to DNC! Just FYI
The Dems can dish it out but can't take it.  Look at the so called hearing with William Barr.  Constant rude interruptions by dems, right?  Even Biden plagiarized the line 'I reclaim my time.'  Hypocrites.
Biden cant walk abd chew gum at the same time lol
Will they ALSO inspect CADIDATES for Wires? Communication Coaching Devices? And cognizant drug testing? The obvious wire Biden was wearing went from "He was not wearing one" To "It was Rosery beads he always wears" You can literally see him listening before answering questions!
Biden won.
Do NOT believe in polls ! VOTE ! Take your family,friends coworkers and neighbors to vote BIDEN/HARRIS and VOTE BLUE

But not all. Trump campaign‚Äôs Tim Murtaugh said the commission was "only doing this (changing the rules)!because their guy got pummeled last night. President Trump was the dominant force and now Joe Biden is trying to work the refs."  Trump wasn‚Äôt dominant, he was rude and loud.
"Would you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential." BIDEN TO TRUMP for interrupting #Debates2020
is Trump's puppet.after how Trump  treated and insulted himself and his family. &amp; Ted still supports Trump. is beyond me!! Chris.let me make myself clear.I'm voting for BIDEN/HARRIS by absentee ballot, which I will deliver to the Election Office,
Fascinating how insecure DT was when Biden used the word ‚Äòsmart‚Äô (Biden took his own entrance exam and did his own homework regardless of which college he attended. There is more honor in attending a college on one‚Äôs merits (than through DT cheating).
Trump spent his first 2020 presidential debate heckling his opponent at every turn. His supporters are hoping he got it out of his system for good.Typical narcissistic unethical  bullying to cover up his huge huge incompetence.
Biden is a loathsome political hack!
Biden is a loathsome political hack!
Chris proved what we already knew. He doesn't like Trump and he couldn't hide his bias toward Biden. I am an avid Fox fan but I no longer watch FNS. I hope that Rupert sends Chris on the road right behind behind Shep It's time to put Brett in Chris's seat.
only because his name is Biden! bottom line he was kicked out of the military for failing a drug test ie cocaine !
Biden the pedophile
Ronna you are so bad at lying yet you persist in lying constantly. No one with a brain believes anything you say. Trump was rude and obnoxious. That is fine because Trump signs are coming down all over Arizona. He is doing a great job of electing Biden.  I really should pay him.
Now wait a Minute! I just read Biden is such a devout Catholic he wears Rosery Beads, which sometimes can be confused with electronic communication devices, worn under your clothes! Now you say he had KKK FRIENDS THEY DONT LIKE CATHLOICS? How is that Possible? I am confused!
That‚Äôs Biden biggest crowds this year üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ it doesn‚Äôt even compare to like 1/32th of a Trump rally üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

got embarrassed last night. Worst performance I‚Äôve ever seen from him,  basically won the election last night. Literally no sane American watched that debate and thought trump deserved another term
I thought Biden did very well! He was the adult, the wise one, the decent one. "It is what it is because is ..You are who you are" Amazing line from  to the clown   on Crack
In times of great crisis, there is strength, resolution, and justice in true leadership.  Mr. Biden epitomizes these qualities.  Mr. Biden, like President Obama, is a true leader, and only he can heal our country from corruption, corporate greed, from an authoritarian, fascist,
Great job Joe! Considering you had to deal with a toddler tantrum,  outstanding and demonstrating true presidential behavior!
Keep up the good work. You are doing a great job of electing Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket.  Where should I send my Thank You card?  Specify a safe place and I will include a generous contribution toward paying down your $1.1 billion debt. Have a great day.

All right here it is Trump saying bigotry and and racism is bad but where is Biden saying that he completely endorses law enforcement and totally condemns the violence
With  you need heavy plexiglass, sound proof booths.  Cut the microphone off in his booth when it is Biden's turn to talk.Other countries are probably laughing at us,we are Not United like we once were But Divided and that is So so Sad for AMERICA üòû
Again because of trumps arrogance , childlike , lack of decorum...adjustments have to be made ..I SAY CALL HIM  OUT ..EMBARRASSMENT TO THIS COUNTRY !
What WAS that?  turned it into a shitshow...next time put a shock collar on him.ü§°ü§°ü§°üíØü§°ü§°ü§°
Again, agreed. Biden‚Äôs best moments were when he looked  into the camera and spoke directly to American people.
Not THAT is TOTAL BS Rosery BEADS. I was Raised Catholic, spent 4 years in Seminary school I am 78 yrs old Known religious people ALL MY LIFE have nery SEEN ANYBODY wear Rosery Beads EXCET NUNS. So is Biden a NUN? They are Circling the wagons! THEY GOT CAUGHT!
Agreed.  But along with Biden‚Äôs empathy and compassion comes emotion. He is who he is. His debate performance isn‚Äôt detached and calculated. It‚Äôs why he will win. He cares about folks.
So what was the point to bring up Biden sons? Did his brother die due to mental illness suicide? And another due to alcohol related issues?Just when I thought he could not get any lower? Trump blew it.   His refusal to denounce white supremacy, his constant dodging of questions
Last night I  participated  in  a  control  group  of  undecided  voters  who  were  appalled  by  DJT‚Äôs ü§° behavior  and  had  all  decided  on  Joe Biden  before  they  left  for  the  night.
"Maybe I shouldn't say this, but the president of the United States conducting himself the way he did ‚Äî I think it was just a national embarrassment," Joe Biden says about Tuesday night‚Äôs debate.
Biden's smiling and laughing were equivalent to head shakes and eye rolls over the inanity of Trump's outrageous behavior.
Sorry - fail big time.  Did not require follow-up from Biden, just a few: green new deal is listed in his plan, didn‚Äôt ask about the bail to the rioters by his staff and running mate, $750 tax question, no question about Hunter and allows vague ‚Äúnot true‚Äù answers.  Bad
I agree.  was rude, disrespectful, mean.  Wouldn't let Biden speak. tRump was off the rails!  An angry old man!  And I LOVED WATCHING HIM COME UNGLUED!
talk in the Camera to the American people and his plans. Going forward. I'm RIDEN WITH BIDEN.
and the Organizational Structure and all it entails like the palm of his hands. If he wins, he will just like Pres. Obama has to hit the ground running to get the US healthier, the Economy  functioning. The Debate was a disgrace. Joe Biden did exactly what he was suppose to do,
This is the way BULLIES conduct themselves when they can't compete, and scared. He showed the world  who he really is.Joe Biden is man knows that W H, Foreign Policy,
Holy Mackerel, you said it.  Actually I‚Äôm ok. This benefits Biden. Bad for democracy, but whatever it takes. Let‚Äôs get on with it.
Every question centered around Trump. None challenged Biden. The MSM is carrying his water as usual.
Biden was wired, had an IV in his wrist and was saved from utter humiliation by Wallace who was the most biased moderator ever seen in a presidential debate! interrupted Trump 35 times, Biden none! Proud boys causing riots? Didn't think we would need to fact check the moderator?
No, but he had strategists. It‚Äôs possible he ignored them,  but I‚Äôm more inclined to believe he was told to go at Biden, rattle him and try to spark Biden‚Äôs temper. I think he just has no awareness and couldn‚Äôt see when to stop. He got on a roll and that‚Äôs what we saw for 90 min.
42% of America loves trump and nothing will sway them from not worshipping and voting for him. It‚Äôs up to the 58% of America to save America from becoming Nazi America.
Among the most important things Joe Biden said in last night's debate was when he addressed American voters directly:   "Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote ... He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome
Cats and Dogs living together! Pandemonium! üòÆ Hey #MAGA2020 folks, are you really that easily scared? Trump is terrified of losing and being prosecuted for tax fraud? He is scared of Biden; you shouldn‚Äôt be. #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica üá∫üá∏
Between he and his son's proceeds from his 47 years in office, I'm sure he can afford to pay through the nose.  Kyle is still a minor, a child.  He has more integrity and self control than either Biden.
Thats WHAT they TOLD BIDEN to SAY over HIS Wire coaching Device! Come on PEOPLE lets DEMAND an INVESTICATION! Call Comely, and Mueller, and Nancy Botoxy!
OK H.P Tell me in the VIDEO HERE on TWITTER What exactly is Biden ADJUSTING inside his coat, on his shirt slightly below his right ear , An ITCH or a BUG? Adjusting with his fingers? Could that BE A WIRE? How many times did I see him Getting a response to Trump?     He had a wire
Look at Biden HE IS WEARING A WIRE he is BEING COACHED I will bet EVERY CENT I HAVE. HE ADJUSTED it ON CAMERA! Where is THE INVESTIGATION?!
He made it CLEAR when the RECORDS are ACTULLY reveled HE PAID MILLIONS! And he also MADE it Clear He complied with ALL the TAX LAWS and Associated TAX BREAKS that were Created and PASSED by Biden and his PARTY!
I believe Biden was in fact WEARING a Wire and being coached! I urge SOMEONE to Check Him before the next debate. Show the people HE DOES GET COACHED!
Let there be no debate about it. If Trump wins. We lose. If Biden wins. We Lose. America has lost in this election regardless of what decision is made. I am sad about this.
Trump is a racist who wants to make America afraid of people of color. That's why he's trying to scare white, suburban housewives that gangs and people of color will take over their neighborhoods if they elect Biden. He's a racist fear monger.

I'm not a masochist and I doubt the American public is, or Joe Biden for that matter. Cancel the rest of the debates.
Chris Wallace was WEAK and couldn't keep control of the debate.  He allowed Biden too many outs and covered for him in tough situations.  Trump was a little too defensive and he was visibly riled but I can't blame him the lies were despicable.
'Here's the Deal'   Biden said that alot!
One of the rules was Trump wasn‚Äôt allowed to stalk Biden like he did Clinton. Put a real crimp in his abusive style although he still managed to be a total jackass. My apologies to jackasses.
I will get torched for this, but Chris Wallace tried hard. Trump was completely out of control. Biden should refuse to attend the next two debates unless the Commission changes the rules to shut off Trump‚Äôs microphone during Biden‚Äôs time, and vice versa.
What if Wallace hadn't been helping Biden throughout the whole debate?
Trump man handled Biden/Wallace 2 on 1
Biden should refuse to attend the next two debates unless Trump‚Äôs microphone is shut off during Biden‚Äôs time, and, of course, Biden‚Äôs microphone is shut off during Trump‚Äôs time.
I agree with Nicolle Wallace~~Trump abused Chris Wallace, Joe Biden and the debate process. Chris Wallace lost control early on and let Trump own him. Trump was emotionally out of control. I thought he was going to stroke out.
That was a shit show!  It was Trump v Biden/Wallace. Trump handled it like a champ!
Seems like a one-sided toddler fight to me.  Not sure what more Biden could have done.  He tried patience but ultimately had to meet Trump where he's at.
Chris Wallace was not good. Sided with Biden
I told you Chris is a Biden Supporter.
Biden threw the whole debate a knockout punch. Trump was a bullying, immature, defenseless liar
The cornered rat had no defense and no way out. Biden crushed Trump and exposed him as bullying, loudmouth liar.
Biden admitting his son had a drug problem and defending him and saying he‚Äôs proud of him for beating it. There‚Äôs all the character I needed to see right there.
I agree Biden is out of his league.
Biden would put us in paris accords again???  No way!

Oops, not happening That  horrendous fact  MUST  be  brought  up..no  moderator better  not  take  any  demands/requests  from   yet 4 dead at Benghazi was fair game.
after yr 1, nobody mentions that Trump does NOT collect the pay he is due for the job of U.S. President, also Biden currently collects Social Security, about $49K

Biden campaign has secured twitter handle  for fact checking debate in real time.  AhHahahahahaha
The nauseating element of the behavior of Obama and Holder and Loretta Lynch and Biden and Harris etc is that the media runs interference for the entire clique!
Obama and Rice and Biden and McCabe, Rosenstein, Strzok, Comey: all sidewinders promoted by the media for reasons that are circumscribed and unknowable! Treason?
The number of high-profile Republicans rallying behind Joe Biden is unprecedented -- and the list keeps growing. It now includes a former GOP governor of Pennsylvania - and a member of George W. Bush's cabinet.
Republicans really want U to think Biden is the one with all the problems. They just came out with a finding there was no wrongdoing.They sound desperate to me.  and his supporters are nothing but anti American criminals,liars, &amp; traitors.They all deserve prison
You can smell the desperation.OMG!  You know  is projecting again!  Check his ears, because he will be the one wearing an ear piece.  Biden doesn't need one.  What a POS tRump is!
Our service men and women are heroes and heroines. They are not losers! Traitor Trump is the loser and definitely not suckers. We must grab traitor Trump by the ballots. Vote joe Biden for president on November 3rd, 2020
Your Joe Biden impressions are hilarious!
We wont hear or see a PEEP about Biden and Nancy Botoxy ARE Catholic's ! Of Course so was Kennedy would not quality as a Democrat Today! Bill Maher called Barrett a "Speaking in tongues Catholic." Hypocrite that he is raised Catholic KNOWs THEY do not Speak in Tongues Not ever.
Just a Quick question here? Please list the Jobs Biden and Saint Hussein had where they ACTULLY performed WORK and Got Paid? Or list some of THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS in the REAL WORLD WHERE THEY WORKED!
But Voters ARE NOT ALLOWED to KNOW about Biden mental condition OR Hunter Biden's China Connections or his Ukraine Extortion! If these RADICALS win This country will become a HELL HOLE! We wont need to worry about immigration NOBODY will WANT TO LIVE HERE.
And its JUST a Coincidence that the LEFT AKA H.P and NY Times are releasing a RECYLED Tax report that was AIRED 4 years ago, the souce of which is THEIR OLD RELIAEABLE. Mr Anonymous just in time to distract from How bad Biden looks in the debates? Ya think?
More H.P BS and NY Times! Once again We the credible Mr Anonymous is their source! This SAME report was issued 4 years ago! Do you think Maybe THEY are THROWING it out to Distract from how badly Biden will do in the debates? Political theater?
Ok if Joe Biden agrees will you submit to a full psychiatric exam?
..."One people, one nation, one America" the same Biden that is now so close to Pope John Paul can't even say "under God"...does he envision tearing down the wall and joining North &amp; South America into "one America" without God?
I heard that Biden is not doing well with the boricuas..Can we verify that? Porque With everything this #OrangeStain did in PR when Hurricane Maria destroyed the island .How he humiliate Ricans with those Bounty Towel..I hate that mofo..

Yes they are. Oh but wait!!! they keep reminding us that Biden is Catholic. Catholic my A$$!! I am Catholic too. In my church abortion is a commission of the Sixth Commandment.
Don‚Äôt get relaxed on what is reported. Take nothing for granted!   We all thought Hillary was a given.... Get out and vote!Go vote!
How scared is  of losing both the debates and the election? Apparently, scared enough to falsely accuse Joe Biden of taking performance-enhancing drugs.
Her husband HAS NONE of the qualities she says are Necessary, Hilarious been in congrees cor 47 years NEVER DID ANYTHING. Trump did more in 47 Months! Who cannot see Biden is ill NOT FIT TO SERVE even if he wasnt.
Without Reading the BS H.P Propaganda piece jst 1 QUESTION! What could it POSSIBLY HURT? Trump HAS VOLUTEERED Why EXACTLY Would Biden refuse IF HE HAS NOTHING TO HIDE?
Good for him, he didn‚Äôt write the tax laws. Dumbasses like Biden/Obama did. All good business men did the same.
Well played, Jill So glad we will have a first lady with intelligence, maturity, and class.She‚Äôs darling. Jill still worked as a teacher as 2nd Lady for the Obamas. A doer. Love when she jumped in to defend Joe from that nut on stage. A little tigerüá∫üá∏üòçüêÖ
We need to be listening to these people who actually worked in this administration.  They are speaking from experience and first hand knowledge.  I am extremely fearful of what this Man will do if/when he is defeated.
What‚Äôs not true? And to say he‚Äôs ‚Äúcompletely lost cognitive ability‚Äù would mean he wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand in front of a crowd and talk to them without a TelePrompter, which he has in fact been doing. Biden has fought a stutter/stammer his whole life. Don‚Äôt confuse that part.
LOL do you really believe what you‚Äôre saying? If so, it‚Äôs pretty clear you‚Äôve only seen stupid sound bytes and not listened to Biden much at all. Eviscerate? Trump wouldn‚Äôt even be able to pronounce that word. He can‚Äôt pronounce Yosemite. He‚Äôll be hapless in a debate.Are you fucking kidding me? Would Trump postpone if Biden was sick. Hell no. GFYS
40 homes in our community - three of us have Biden and Kelly signs....
So too therefore, Shouldn‚Äôt we have all of Biden‚Äôs health records too! Start calling for Biden to be tested for dementia. You have influence..
Bernie is campaigning for Biden HARD this weekend, has a ton of rallies scheduled. Biden is more of a "behind the scenes" candidate, wish he'd transition to being more visible.
And when your done, think of the more than 300k that died waiting to be seen by the VA while Biden was VP.
I want trump to get well so he can face justice after Biden wins the election.
As opposed to l Biden who was mentored by a grand wizard, pushed for segregation, and only significant bill in 47 years  locked up minorities for too long to make sure the ‚Äúpredators‚Äù didn‚Äôt create a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù? GTFO üòÇ
The problem is Biden &amp; the Democratic Party are just fine with this Justice pick. Republicans win &amp; Democrats don‚Äôt have to do anything about it. They can just blame Trump &amp; the Republicans while they spend the next 50 yrs fighting social justice wars all over again.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely.
Sorry.. voting Blue kills us ALL!  You don't let an OLD man, like Biden, who has DEMENTIA have his finger on the nuclear button!
Biden won the last debate though
No sympathy votes for Trump. Wish him well but vote Biden. EVEN if Pence is the nominee , vote Biden!!
No, here‚Äôs the truth. Your boy Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a large bathroom with supporters. Yes there were empty seats but he still outdraws Biden a thousand to one. How do you like that fact?
I will vote Biden
"You should be more curious about Biden/Harris‚Äôs refusal to answer basic policy questions that will change this country forever"
It seems so probable that "Pompeo" and "pompous" come from the same root word, but I haven't found any verification of that.  Then again, it's interesting that the DNC is "Biden' its time" until its own version of Konstantin Chernenko drifts away and  Kamala takes over.  Names...
Your boy Biden can‚Äôt fill a large bathroom  with supporters. Every Trump rally has been gigantic. That‚Äôs what worries you. What worries me is... you think ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù and respecting the flag by showing it... is propaganda. Spin that A hole.
Bloomberg hoping Trump is "unable to govern" because of Covid, while wanting Biden elected, a man with DEMENTIA, who is unable to govern.  It's comical.
It‚Äôs easier to make voting change the system when we don‚Äôt have someone in charge who is actively trying to destroy our democracy. The plan should be to get trump out and bully Biden to the left.
I am voting for Biden and we will have humanity back! Its going to happen. üíô
Biden reminds me of an 80 yr old man trying to look young. The jog from behind the poster is a nice touch!
Before you fill your ballot out, think about how Trump lied about the dangers of this virus from the very beginning. Mocking others like Joe Biden for wearing masks.  Holding maskless rallies and W.H. events has endangered members of the GOP. #VoteHimOut2020
Every day we talk to hundreds of voters, and one thing is clear: we need elected leaders like Mark kelly and Joe Biden. In Arizona, there are 2 days left to register to vote, and voting begins in 4 days
Same here in AZ, we're afraid to see what would happen if we put out Biden signs. Several Trump signs on our street.
We were driving around Paradise Valley in AZ ( wealthiest in AZ) and 4 Biden signs for every dump signüá∫üá∏üëèüèΩ
Yes, Biden should run all his ads. Trump is running some of the biggest lie ads I've ever seen, here in AZ. I feel like we should kick his despicable ass while he's down.
Who knows maybe he‚Äôll make another Joe Biden blunders and really vote for Trump üòÇ
Just an opinion so I don't want people to take my tweets to serious. We would have to be there to know what is really going on but it just seems odd that's all. He usually is spouting out something nasty about Biden or Obama. So I will just continue to watch the news for updates.
At least Biden supporters are practicing social distancing unlike the supporters of the other guy...
I will respect your commitment to health &amp; making good flicks. Your Biden choice is unsettling &amp; I believe you are thinking about which side of the bread is buttered for you. Congratulations you have lost a lowly deplorable as a fan.
In other words lets wait and see if Biden wins the election cause if he does then all of this will get swept back under the rug.
Joe Biden Campaign Scrambles to Adjust to New Uncertainty in Race  via
Biden and his Wife tested negative for covid. Trump and his wife didn‚Äôt. So Trump is at a hospital with covid and his wife is home with hers. Sad
Neither is Biden unfortunately. All we can do is wait. Negative test results so close to possible exposure aren‚Äôt really diagnostic. He needs to be retested and if a week, 2 weeks from debate night he‚Äôs still negative then he‚Äôs probably ok. Pins and needles until then.
‚Ä¶and I'm demanding that Trump remove his negative ads about Biden
Are you serious?!! That is just about the most selfless act ever. God bless Joe Biden. #VoteBiden
Sorry America, I can't make the entire video more serious, because to me Joe Biden is a joke, and his refusal to answer questions because that answer will become an issue or a headline is a cop out. He's a coward and RED CHINA is using him as a PAWN in their plan to dominate us
I can do this too. A high level DEM source told me Joe Biden is stopping  his campaign because his mental capacity has become a serious concern.
This is the British Prime Minister wishing President Trump a speedy recovery. Notice the signs on the backhoe and his hard hat then notice the Biden Harris slogan. I wonder. Of course I believe that dark hill behind him is a pile of cow manure so there is that!!!
They weren't strokes, they were aneurysms.
No one from the Biden campaign should agree to be in the same room with a single person from the Trump campaign. They lie about everything. It isn‚Äôt safe.
You are blaming COVID on Trump?  Trump stopped travel from China is January and was called a "Xenophobe" by you leftists, Pelosi and Biden.  What say you about Pelosi inviting people in her district to parade in Feb?
Learn to read. It's going get worse when Biden is elected because the thugs are gonna be mad. Got it?
#Biden vs #Biden. Which side wins?
Imagine if we had an honest media.
Also, go look up some of the stuff Biden has said about people of color. You'll be mindblown
So vote Biden and Co in so we can enjoy more months of lockdowns and also socialism.
And this is why Biden must continue to show he is better. The racist are still energized

Yeah Biden evolved after he benefitted. Please don‚Äôt try selling that pig in a poke. It makes you look uneducated.
I think Biden is familiar with Laura Mercier.
And rump made fun of Biden for keeping a far distance.
Joe Biden said he decided to run when President Trump said inside both groups there's good people.  And if Joe doesn't understand what the President meant by that he doesn't qualify to take my order at McDonald's.
Immediately,  I want Biden impeached for all his notorious crimes.  But then Kamala would have the presidency.
25% have moved to Biden the terrorist!  I pray for it too it looks very grim now

Biden seems to observe the basic precautions about spreading the virus.
Well, because that's exactly what Biden wants to do and he's said it. Bernie Sanders has his hand up Joe Biden's rectum that he's telling him what to say and directing all of his movements.
If Biden wins, he may make us. That's who DemonCraps are.
How is Pence Not sick? I‚Äôm so worried about Biden!
Biden‚Äôs team should come back with updated ads that show Trump‚Äôs reckless behavior &amp; then his trip to the hospital. Trump can‚Äôt be trusted.
I‚Äôm in Arizona and negative ads against Biden/Harris are running full steam ahead.
Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt be reacting to Trump news. Biden and the Dems need to focus on their own race. As far as ads go, if they are true and accurate, why take them down?
The Biden‚Äôs are almost to the White House!!!üòÑüòÑüëçüòõ
Unless you know something that FBI Director Wray does not, Antifa, which stands for anti fascism, is an ideology, not an organization.   However, Biden, Harris, Schumer, &amp; Pelosi have repeatedly issued public statements condemning violence/violent protest of any kind by anyone.

It was Christie's strategy to scream over Biden while he was trying to speak. If you've ever heard him address the people of New Jersey, it's totally believable.
I guess Fox only wants Biden to suspend campaign.
I am a lifelong Dem and supporter of Biden, but I don‚Äôt know how we can complain about Qanon and then tweet something like this from ‚Äúa GOP source.‚Äù It‚Äôs irresponsible, IMHO.

Why Joe Biden can't expect to automatically get the #Latino vote  via  Just don't get why any Latino, person of color or woman, would vote for Trump. Are they not paying attention?
The Republicans will be too busy jamming Corey Barrett on to the supreme court before they are defeated bigly Nov. 3.  So much for democracy.  Biden will have a tough time repairing the damage that has been done in the past four years.
Okay I didn‚Äôt think about it that way, I was thinking that he is not going to be able to do rally‚Äôs and stuff unlike Biden but I forgot technology runs 2020.
Trump was TRYING to get Biden infected at the Debate.  He KNEW he had Covid, so he arrived late so he couldn‚Äôt be tested.  So he could infect Biden.  Unacceptable.  #VeteransForTrump #EvangelicalsForTrump #WomenForTrump #ChristiansForTrump #LatinosForTrump #Texas #Florida #Iowa

I'm so upset about the Commission on Presidential Debates not holding Trump to the agreed upon rules! It's unconscionable they failed to test him prior to the debate, endangering Biden, bc DT &amp; his clan arrived late &amp; then they didn't enforce the mask mandate for Trump's side!?!?
That just seems like peak 2020.  Pence takes over, the RNc announces that Trump‚Äôs electors will back Pence, and independents decide to vote for him over Biden because at least Pence isn‚Äôt senile...
So you will demand Biden‚Äôs cognitive tests results then?
If you can't vote this year just vote for Joe Biden in 2024.

This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.

Let‚Äôs keep talking about Biden. He who shall not be named is soaking up the publicity.
This tells me Trump and possibly his family had it on Tuesday night, they refuse to wear masks, and they spread it to other people even possibly Joe Biden.
Trump wouldn't pause for a second if Biden were ill.
I've made jokes about Biden and dementia, don't get me wrong but I'm careful since it runs in my family. But yeah, I don't want anyone to die. I just try to be a good person, and go from there. I hope as a society we can get back to that you know?

Joe Biden has taken those CDC changes, incorporated them into his public behavior, and led people thru example. The hallmark of an effective leader.  Trump sneers at masks, in turn, encouraging his knuckle-dragging base to mimic his poor behavior. The hallmark of a shitty leader.

That‚Äôs what class looks like Mr. Trump. Take notes now or from your hotel when Biden moves into the White House but please take notes!!
It‚Äôs not paranoia when no 1 can get their story straight. not even the doctors.  He still got Biden to remove his adds, gets to skip the debates, gets to avoid malaria‚Äôs hate recording AND can say it‚Äôs not bad.I REALLY hope I‚Äôm wrong. I would be much happier if he actually has it
Plague?? I thought it was no big deal just the flu? Remember he made fun of Biden for wearing a mask lol.
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
And if Biden is planning any big gatherings in Arizona, he should be told the same thing.
If this thing was actually highly contagious don‚Äôt you think Biden would‚Äôve gotten it or is going to get it? This should be an eye opener

Hi Dr. Biden, please implore Joe to put all of his ads, including the negative ads, back up and in rotation. All guns blazing. For the love of God and country.
Lol, get serious. Trump has been campaigning for four years. Biden has three years to go to catch up. Hypocrisy rules Republicans!
If the #publicoption were imposed on the #American public, everyone could lose their private healthcare plans. #MarkKellyforSenate
And didn't have the common courtesy to inform the Biden campaign despite being in close contact with them just a few short hours prior to his diagnosis.
The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Yah thats no issue. If Trump were to die Nov 4, then Pence just becomes the most lame duck lame duck of all time and keeps the seat warm until Biden.  The nightmare is if Trump dies before Nov 3 and somehow still wins. Then what?
Biden should put his negative ads back up, for the simple reason. Trump would do the same.
President Trump has done more in four years then Joe Biden did in 47! Biden is just like every other politician, a liar and a crook!Trump for President AGAIN!!!
Vice President Pence will campaign in Arizona on Thursday, the day after the VP debate with Sen. Harris.   Biden and Harris will also be campaigning in Arizona on Thursday.

Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
When you don‚Äôt adhere to the science this is what can happen. I guess Biden spending time in his basement wasn‚Äôt such a bad idea after all!
This whole thing was made up so he can get away with not doing anymore debates, get off the topic of malanias hate recordings, and come out in 2 weeks and say the virus is nothing to worry about. And he got Biden to remove all his adds. You‚Äôre right I think it‚Äôs BS.
That liar biden denies that what he is saying in this video. And people want to vote for this socialist untruthful damn fool.
(2) If Biden and DEMs admitted what Trump actually said and didn't make a major ongoing project of maliciously twisting it, but simply said they doubt Trump's sincerity in saying it, I could respect that.  That's NOT what they're doing.  This is about THEIR level of integrity.
Read the article again. Biden denounced violence. He has not denounced Antifa as an organization. As i said, I‚Äôm sure he does, but he can‚Äôt say it.
We need to elect a vigorous, healthy person as President of the United States. Compare Joe Biden on his bike with the overweight (6 ft, 244 pounds) Donald Trump riding his Golf cart. That's especially true after his Covid19 diagnosis

Literally you post an article about what Trump's company was accused of doing in 1973 when his father was still running it, and count that as more relevant than a smoking-gun video to a claim that DEMs are distorting Trump's words.  Almost as far back as Biden fighting Corn Pop!

Reading all those left uninformed people really makes me cringe.  They have no clue what they want.  If Joe told them to go jump off a cliff they would.  Reading their comments saying Biden will/would do better is funny and scary because they actually believe the lies. #TRUMP2020
This January 20th, Joe Biden is going to be the 47th President, not the 46th.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
Even IF you were making a persuasive, objective argument that Trump has always been a racist (you aren't), you're still flagrantly moving goalposts on this. The issue is DEMs all the way up to Biden systematically, maliciously misrepresenting what Trump SAID; the video proves it.
‚ÄúStimulus‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt this just because they want adoring crowds? Then again, in my north-central-Phoenix neighborhood, Biden signs outnumber Trump signs 4 to 1.
Just like the Trump camp continues their Biden bashing with their commercials
Even if your Gish Gallop of unproven claims here proved Trump is a "RACIST", it is beside the point that DEMs all the way up to Biden are LYING about what Trump SAID. BTW, Trump "attacks" a lot of people of any color/gender; why not  too if he just hates black women?
I would be the first to say that Dem party overall needs to find commom cause with pro-life/anti-abortion folks.  Despite that, these pro-life evangelicals for Biden understand that soooooo much more is on the line this election.
Is Biden an Antifa rioter? Of course not, and I have no doubt he throughly opposes (and probably he despises) them. But he can‚Äôt be loud and clear about it, because that would damage his coalition.
(2) Again, my point was about the wholesale malicious distortion of what Trump SAID, going all the way up to Biden himself. If you want to ADMIT what he said but doubt he meant it, that's one thing. Repeatedly and deliberately distorting what he DID say is inexcusable.  Period.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
That debate should have been stopped because of that. If Biden gets sick, whoa Nellie. I think the country will become unglued. This selfish selfish selfish man has been COVIDs #1 supporter thru his handling and minimizing of this crisis.
Basement Biden is fine and will be in great health to lose this election. #Trump2020
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden is a much better man! A man of empathy is what this country needs to help us heal!!! I‚Äôm so proud to be voting for
Well Kurt, that guy actually has a sophisticated and realistic understanding of politics. Sort of like Joe Biden, who understands a robust denunciation of Antifa rioters might endanger his coalition, and cost him the Presidency.
Oh my blood pressure went way up when I read this but the best part is Biden never faltered
Wow, just wow!  31 days until President-elect Biden is all can say to this.
You‚Äôre in for a really rough year buddy everything and believe is incorrect.  HRC &amp; Biden we‚Äôre in cahoots with Russia and, much worse, China.  It will all be exposed soon. #Trump2020
They are speaking the truth though. You know you'd be dancing on Biden's grave, we all know that.
This should highlight the main difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  States should be able to decide what is best for them.
About same troop levels, no major new wars, and failing coups.   My thought was where do we want our problems.  Home:Trump  Abroad:Democrats  Not voting for Trump or Biden but I still think it holds true and would rather have to face our problems here
He's on oxygen and he's exhausted he can't breathe somebody yesterday a doctor on here said that when you're winded you can't even hold up a phone they're lying I think he has a virus days before they said he did and he tried to infect Biden at the debate
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, didn't notify Biden (whom he shared an indoor debate stage with on Tuesday night), and continued onto a fundraiser and rally in Minnesota. On Thursday, he started an antibody therapy and went to a fundraiser in New Jersey.
The rope hangs empty awaiting conviction death sentence on Brotherhood Obama Biden and Hillary  genocide artists on Arab countries . Last report was 5 million Arabs murdered by their terrorists all for Israel Rothschild‚Äôs !
this secured my Biden vote.
Not a suicide manslaughter but then he needs to go to jail for trying to kill Biden with the virus because that was all pre-planned and we know that now
Please you and VP Biden stay safe keep up your immunity we need you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #voteforbidenharris  #TrumpLied200KAmericansdied
Fact check: Hunter Biden's military discharge was administrative, not dishonorable  #SmartNews
Biden wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about his plan, Wallace hates Trump, how do you prepare? Trump got Biden to denounce the violence and say he doesn‚Äôt support the NGDü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biden should lose 1/3 of the DNC support for those 2 things, the new taxes should do the rest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Biden has stopped his attack ads, so it‚Äôs up to me:   Trump seems like the kind of grandpa who gives his grandkids a handshake for their birthdays. Joe Biden probably buys them a trampoline. Fun Grandpa 2020!
Yes I saw the sweating in the cottonmouth I thought it was from all the drugs which again such an addict on top of everything I think he purposely went to infect Biden no doubt in my mind
Tough call, although I‚Äôve seen no fewer than three Republicans for Biden signs in Laura‚Äôs neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want us to get complacent
Did Chris Wallace wear a mask. No!!! Did he get a Covid 19 test before the debate. NO he arrived too late. You say " Follow The Science" Take your own damn advice Chris Biden I mean Wallace.
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
Expanded Hours! Our office is open today and Sunday, Oct. 3-4, from 9 to 4. Pick up yard signs (out of Biden/Harris) and please consider doing a no-contact lit drop for candidates. We're at: 290 S Alma School Rd, Suite 15, Chandler (please wearüò∑)
üëÄ Buried in the middle of this article: An Arizona NYT/Siena (A+) poll is underway. Friday polling (after Trump‚Äôs positive Covid disclosure) was beneficial to Biden. This will be a good nonpartisan quality poll result just before AZ ballots mailed on Wed.
Trump and his administration will effect everyone as long as he stays in power, we must vote him out and remove GOP too, vote vote biden harris
What would you know about unity? ‚ÄúDivide and conquer‚Äù were your words. As general Mattis pointed out, they were also the words used by the Nazis. Admit it: if Trump had given Covid to Joe Biden you‚Äôd be asking Biden to pull out of the race.
The Chauncey Gardner candidate.
While not quarantining, Biden generally displays very Covid-safe behavior and I'm sure he's doing even more now.  I trust his judgement that he won't be flippant about it.
Political gangbanging is all around Arizona right now lol one side of the street banging Biden the other side is banging Trump ü§£ü§£ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Love you Joe Biden!  Go get em!
AND he was most dangerous as a spreader of COVID on TUESDAY. He figured he'd take a shot at killing Biden.
Paula-confusion the norm for Trump White House. Why would we expect something different? Looking üëÄforward to calm, truthful leadership w Biden admin. Sick of chaos/lies ü§¢.
Sorry, that comment was towards Biden, not you. My mistake. Stay safe my fellow patriot.
We need a video on this..promptly!.No Mr.Nice Guy!!.he HOPED he could get Biden sick. DONT honor the devil.
And the Trumps arrived late to the debate and did not get tested. There wasn‚Äôt enough time. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that it was not purposeful. Prating the Biden‚Äôs are safe. Trump didn‚Äôt even call Biden to tell him he was positive!üò°üò°üò°
Honestly you are an idiot.  The President, your friend is in the hospital, possibly far sicker than his docs or the White House admits and you are tweeting about what wussies the Biden teams is.  The country is worried about the leader of the free world.  You?  Debates.
I'm just confused why he hasn't been indicted already on the 205,000 dead but yes this was premeditated and it was against Biden that should be capital murder land it conspiracies about it
Dr. Biden was there, too. Can you imagine endangering not only  but  after their family has already lost so much? Just pure evil.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
Remember that midnight flight him in the wifey took maybe they got some blood transfusions or something to keep them going so they could infect the debate that's all I can think of they wanted to get Biden sick
This is about as silly as the ridiculous Biden had an earpiece nonsense.
Yes! Please look! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
Womp womp womp! When you have no legitimate argument, attack with analysis of the choice of words. Your boy Biden never gets the words right though you know what he ‚Äúmeans‚Äù right? Fine, he put his life of the line for the freedom of you and me...complete strangers!
And it would have tried to infect Biden again or Harris or any of us
Can‚Äôt think you would like to live in a government socialist country. With Biden and especially Harris you will be doing that.
He tried to kill Joe Biden.
Even Joe Biden at the debate, said a quick PRAYER to Trump, and Joe didn't know at 1st, hehehe. Take look at the paused 54th minute (My energy orientation is Right to Left= 54...45)  Joe uses a hand gesture known as the 221 Factor to symbolize God  Take a look &amp; see for yourself
No, Trump and the Radical Right are  trying to pull a fast one. The Radical Right won't have enough votes to put it through. With all the GOP senators (and more to come) becoming ill, no vote will take place until Pres Biden takes office and the Dems rule.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
I watched and it was Biden who interrupted 1st.
Trump himself was a biological weapon against Biden. Sick.
Trump purposely arrived "too late for covid19 check" and exposed many people including Biden etc
Because he is an Ardent Biden supporter and if you watch him he doesn't even pretend to remain neutral he is as biased as they come. Everyone knew he wouldn't be fair. Trump has to interrupt to point out all of the lies being spit out.
All my prayers go to the families for dealing with that one extra or maybe two extra seats at their table when Biden said that I burst into tears girl it's the worst feeling ever and me and you know how it feels how could they not
We will never know if and when Biden gets the virus since he‚Äôs permanently quarantined in his bunkers..we may have to trust his handlers - NOT!
Your husband mocked Biden‚Äôs son who has an addiction.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
I'd say that accusing Trump of attempted murder is just a little strong. Trump isn't that smart. Gross negligence, I can buy -- but a deliberate, specific attempt to kill Joe Biden? Dramatic much?
You know didn't we say that that Biden should stay safe and they use the Honor Code system at the debate Are you seriously kidding me and they purposely took their masks off to try to infect Biden
Because lockdowns just don‚Äôt work.  But that doesn‚Äôt stop Biden ‚Äú...I‚Äôll shutdown the country.‚Äù
Proof Alinski Marxist Democrat Operative Chris Wallace is promulgating fake news to help Biden during the debate
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely. More by
Oh, but we WILL vote for Biden!!
I‚Äôm just gonna say it: Biden needs to seriously consider quarantining himself. He‚Äôs done everything right so far; this is not the time for him to not follow public health guidelines.
He was positive Wednesday morning, yet never reached out to the Biden campaign to inform them. They were informed at the same time the rest of the world was: late Thursday night. He is a psychopath
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump knowingly exposed people to a deadly virus. In Minnesota and New Jersey. Biden better up the negative ads. Immediately.
Trump Vs Biden Debate, Our Thoughts  via  #WalkAway #VoteRed #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
Honestly ,I feel like this is a play to first try and get rid of the president and Vice president which would immediately put Fancy Nancy as Acting President which open doors for Biden to win then after the first year Biden resigns ,which makes Kamala President and Nancy VPü§îü§îü§î
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
Bigly. Why should Biden stop his campaign? Trump did this to himself  &amp; literally infected people himself. He knew in Jan and Thursday morn.209k people are dead. He is a murderer. Whatever Joe Biden does, he will be doing it with a mask on. #TrumpHasCovid #VetsAgainstTrump
The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76.3 years and 81.1 years for females. Pelosi - 80 Bernie - 79 Biden - 77 Trump - 74  Why are we still voting people in that are likely to die soon?
Biden lies everyday and Boone calls him out. I love the light that he attended the black college. Did you see the people looking at each other like yeah sure!
No Biden shouldn‚Äôt cancel anything.trump would be making fun of him just like he did Hillary.
JUST IN: VP Mike Pence is returning to the Valley next week to host a campaign rally, on the same day former VP Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris will be here.  #abc15 #election2020

CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Cuts Interview With Trump Spokesman After He Brings Up Biden‚Äôs Record On Racial Issues
My understanding is that Trump and Biden were supposed to be tested before the debate. But, Trump arrived late and he was not tested before the debate!!!
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
In Arizona, countless elected officials wished President Trump a speedy recovery Friday. The president‚Äôs campaign announced changes to his planned visits to the state next week. And some grumbled about the lack of safeguards at previous Trump rallies.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
Also promoting that Biden will win according to stocks buys and the GOP will lose the Senate. Resulting in higher taxes and much more regulation which will upset everything but that‚Äôs ok because it will all calm down in the long run. Geez.
#newsmax Quite a bit has been written about #chriswallace and his obvious anti-Trump bias exhibited during the Trump-Biden debate. But I haven't seen anything written about this exchange: Wallace asked #potus45 if he was willing to "condemn . . militia groups". &gt; &gt; &gt;
Of course he would.   He‚Äôs celebrated when Hillary Clinton had pneumonia. Vice President Biden has taken the highroad. If the situation were flipped there‚Äôs no road too low for Trump!!!
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Have you actually followed the policies he‚Äôs supported? He‚Äôs a terrible speaker and no clue how to use tone, but we all watched Biden blatantly lie and exaggerate to us during the debate over and over... but his tone of voice was consoling.
ü§£ Biden supporters are literally the scum of this planet.
Biden/Harris are visiting AZ this week sooooo this seems like a poorly planned attack
Nancy Pelosi  Chuck Schumer  Biden Muslim Brothers stop spreading lies fake rumors  all foreign countries except for  Iran wished  him wellness  .
Biden better be #maninabubble
No notice to Biden. WH  is one sick group
Do you want humanity back? Work to get Joe Biden elected president. Maybe we can restore some of it.
I don't care about Trump. What was Biden's test result today??
Wallace promulgated false statements &amp; debunked fake news as fact, then stepped in to debate Trump on his false premise stories. He should have joined Biden, at his podium. Wallace exposes the disguise of previously fair &amp; balanced Fox News, now just more scripted leftist MSM.
Only of Tulsi, unfortunately.  Biden could almost literally eat babies for breakfast and be OK in their book just for Not Being Trump.
Trump knew he had it. He was hoping that Biden would get it. Evil at its best.
Hey Arizona ‚Äújournalists‚Äù, ask Mark Kelly about his position on guns and Biden‚Äôs tax hikes, in between sessions of rooting for our President to die, of course.  Just a thought. #DoYourJob
The current news cycle focused on Trump‚Äôs prognosis and the numbers of infected Republicans from last week‚Äôs super spreader events is the most effective negative ad Biden could hope for, and it‚Äôs costing him nothing.
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I am hoping President Biden does not go down the path of "leaning forward. Must heal the Nation." I agree with you. Put in place the team, investigate and prosecute all of those who broke the law.
AgreeüíØüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ. #BidenHarris need to keep moving FULL SPEED AHEAD! Stop being nice &amp; keep moving! tRUMp &amp; his people would taking advantage if it were #Biden that had #COVID19!
Guy acts like the pink Eveready bunny or a Timex watch. Kinda incredible compared to no-show, basement dwelling Biden. Sharp contrast!
I just read an article the whole family at the debate refuse to follow any guidelines except Melania find that very interesting dot-dot. I truly believe they were trying to give Biden the virus on purpose
I hope he does, at least with him, we know what we‚Äôre up against and know we can beat him. I don‚Äôt want to lose all the Republicans for Biden.
Is he voting for Biden?
You seem a little angry there that I was able to so easily knock down the ‚ÄúJoe Biden gave the eulogy of the head of the KKK‚Äù lie.   A person should not be judged on what they once did but on what they currently consistently do and say.  has ALWAYS been a racist
1.  It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, it‚Äôs the Constitution, meaning 2.  Biden doesn‚Äôt have any power to delay the election, so 3.  Being a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù has nothing to do with anything.  If the situation was reversed, no way tRump delays the election.  He won‚Äôt even stop negative ads.

BIDEN WINS ELECTION!
Democrats are liars and cheaters so naturally you would think that because all you have to compare it to is the most dishonest of human beings. I love all the polls about Biden being aheadü§£ just like killary was in 2016 right. DJT will be your president until 2024. ü§£ü§£ü§£

Biden steals the show with homerun amid bombshell news of Trump‚Äôs infection  via
Biden oversaw the longest stretch of job growth in American history. Obama/Biden added more NEW jobs in their last 3 years than Trump did in his first 3. Then he crashed the economy and will leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. Get your facts straight.
Biden &amp; Harris also in Arizona on Thursday
I have no fucks to give to Trump, Biden needs to double down and destroy #IdiotInChief Trump. We need a leader in this country not a fucking self centered micro Dick motherfucker.
No doubt, Trump would ridicule Biden as weak, just as he did Hillary Clinton, when she had pneumonia.
You coached Trump to scream at Joe Biden to rattle him. It didn‚Äôt work. #Karma
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
You really are not top of the gene pool with tweets like this. Did Trump also create the COVID cocktail in China and spread it to the world? He acted quicker than the WHO who told him not to overreact and shut down flights. As you Biden would say, c‚Äômon, man!
I often wonder where these people will go after 2020.   Trump won't hire them if he wins. Neither will Biden.   Are they hoping to wait for another GOP president in 2024 who might hire them, or are they done with Gov't service and are just YOLO-ing?
BIDEN SAID HE WILL FUND HAMAS!! BIDEN SAID NO MORE FUNDING TO EGYPT !! BBIDRN SAID HE WILL RAISE TAXES ! THINK WGEN GE FUNDS HAMAS HE IS PLANNING TO HO BACK TO ME TO KILL FOR #NWO HE HAS TO DEPOPULATE!
He is an orange treason weasel who somehow got COVID.
I could link a lot to you that would conflict with your conclusion, including his work with (and $ support for) Jesse Jackson.  But you aren't even interested in the evidence I've already offered, refuting a MAJOR Biden/DEM accusation about  Trump's "very fine people" statement.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering
Biden is the¬†‚ÄúPresident Most Likely To Keep Me Alive‚Äù.  Answer to If Trump recovers from COVID-19 with no issues, won‚Äôt he be broadcasting to the whole nation that it‚Äôs not as big of an issue as it seems? by Sandy Patterson
I know he'd make a commercial saying how weak Biden was and how he was lying about being sick because you know it's a hoax and that's how they were going to get more votes and the Sons would be high as a kite all over the news right now
Biden is a dirty low ball Democrat to take money from Rothschild just like Woodrow Wilson and many others to Vote Trump out ! Trump does not follow #NWO like Obama Biden Hillary ! So you want death stupid Democrats you vote for Biden there is a hell and God !
Do you know who the guy is holding Biden's hand Eddie? He fought against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was a longtime member of the KKK. You sure you want a guy who's buddies with someone like that as your president?
Just finished watching the DL; what a lyin‚Äô bigot  is! Both Biden and Trump equally responsible for the failed debate?
This is not Biden‚Äôs problem. trump wouldn‚Äôt suspend his.
Biden should ask for that test now.. You ready Lil Donnie?
I honestly regret voting for Hillary. She was so fucking bad that she still lost even tho many like myself held my nose. At least she said the right things. Biden can give two shits about my views ... So again, no thanks to any shit sandwich.
Well, I will take another 4 years of that since the policies are far better than the alternative socialist model we will get with Harris/Biden. Is that what you are advocating?
They did have it totally under Control.McConnell cutting entitlement's.Both Parties Loot the Treasury and go on Vaca,Blame it on Trump. So Biden gets elected and use him to Screw US on the other end.Putting a stop on Wages and Benefits for 10 years at least. And nothing changes.
Reminder: GOP put us into the Great Recession: Obama/Biden saved us even with GOP resistance
I no longer play along to this game that allowed Republicans and corporations to win for decades. Let Trump win. Dems can either whine like babies and blame voters or take responsibility for chosing shit candidates like Hillary and Biden. I think the former will happen.

No problem. Just vote for Joe Biden.
Trump is also positive with covid when Biden isn‚Äôt. Trump is also in the hospital when Biden isn‚Äôt. Dumbass republicans had to have their event where no one wore a mask and now look at the outcome. I don‚Äôt give a damn who‚Äôs tested daily.
Trump will win in a landslide as long as we get a fair vote. More Trump supporters line the roadway that Biden drives down to reach one of his rallies then attend. Biden isn‚Äôt just bad, he‚Äôs pathetic.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
I bet it is one of the same people who tried to debunk Biden wearing a wire during the debate! üòÇüòÇ
Just found a street in my neighborhood with 5 Biden signs and 0 Trump! My faith in Scottsdale is restored!
Even Joe Biden is sympathetic towards President Trump. I‚Äôve seen so many ‚ÄúDeath to Trump‚Äù tweets. Grow the fuck up!!
Simple as this. How about trump shows up when he‚Äôs supposed to so he can get tested? Trump is a buffoon, a con man, a narcissist and a pathological liar. He has no ‚Äúhonor‚Äù and if were Biden‚Äôs campaign I would‚Äôve told him to fuck off and get tested.

I know this is a year old but the fact that most people don‚Äôt really pay attention to it is interesting. You really think he has changed?
Sorry, I have to say that this graph could be misleading.  The aerosol particles may not drop to the floor due to gravity.  Think about the ventilation system that might have carried them to where Biden stood.  Any future debate events should be cancelled.
Chris Wallace spoon fed Biden answers and repulsed me with his Trump attacks! Can‚Äôt go through this again.
Only if Biden wins
VP Pence will be in #Arizona hosting a campaign event on Thursday - the same day as Biden and Harris - after the campaign said #POTUS won‚Äôt be at the rallies scheduled for Monday and Tuesday (and those are postponed/virtual)    #Election2020
Getting a little ahead of yourself there, or are you as delusional as Biden is? I guess his supporters don't fall far from the same tree.
The Party really wants him to lose to Biden.
Pray for Trump and vote for Biden.
He was mocking  VP Joe Biden and not only for wearing a üò∑ but try to humiliate him whit his Son ‚Äòs  Donald Trump Deserves everything that is happening to him he has put this nation In hell this very moment the American people are looking to a total LOOSER EVIL ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•.

needs to declare a war on covid. If Trump doesn‚Äôt die he will come back as the ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù and commit to fight covid. His ratings will  go up. Who cares if you already gave a plan Biden, do it again and make it sexy.

He shouldn't have done that, disagree strongly with him trying to show sympathy for Chump when Chump would absolutely NOT do the same back for Biden!
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.
The Bible tells us not to lie. You are not pro-life if you vote for Biden.
That's a crock of shit. The show must go on! Chump wouldn't stop the election for Joe Biden-- you can bet on that!
From  Why   can't expect to automatically get the Latino vote.
Read this thread, and then tell me how Democrats are not the party of hate.  Biden says he represents all people.  Don't believe it!
The virus infected ‚Äú7,000,000‚Äù people, not the president. CDC never claimed no one would get infected, look at the rest of the world.  Biden and Pelosi fought against the quarantine when the president tried to protect the country.
He absolutely should be on full court press. Biden should not suffer the foolish decisions of Trump.
If Biden wins you will be one of the first they come after. You just couldn‚Äôt wait until after the election
Trump chose to put himself and others at risk, adults understand they must face the consequences of their actions. Biden chose not to put himself/others at risk and Trump belittled him for this. Vote Biden/Harris.
Walking my rottweiler atm. Seen this baddie probably 40ish running. She was rocking a Trump hat. We good üá∫üá∏üôè seen one neighbor with a Biden sign.

Go Joe Biden for President üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
Joe Biden and most of the Democrat party are blatant hypocrites.
I would never wish anyone get COVID or sick- but do not think for a second that If the roles were reversed, that our President would be sympathetic or civil to Joe Biden. He‚Äôs mocked sick, disabled and more. He would NOT take the high ground on this.
He was the one that put together the report on Biden‚Äôs corruption. Suspicious? You betcha!!
The Trump-Biden Stakes: Your Life Savings
Vice President Biden &amp; Mrs. Biden you are so much above trump, that it's nice you can give empathy to him and his family. God Bless you and keep you healthy and safe. Pls don't go in harms way again, please.
think about all the ‚Äúquiet professionals‚Äù whose jobs and livelihoods have been sacrificed because Biden and Barry did nothing in 2013 when we had the flu epidemic. And Biden called trumps travel restriction from china ‚Äúracist and xenophobic‚Äù
The Chinese have Biden in their back pocket.
Lets see, #Trump-Russia was fully debunked, but #Biden-China appears to be factual. Hmmmmm. Yet the #Stupid still insist on believing in the former. Go figure?
It potentially benefits him. But this is too elaborate and risky to be a hoax. It actually hurts him politically also. He loves to tweet, and hold rallies. He loves to be in front of camera. He's a narcissist. No way he'd be okay hiding out while Biden campaigns.
Here is my question for  and  et al ... let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that Trump is not the candidate for whatever reason.  Are you still for Biden or will you reward Pence, who has enabled and covered for all this bullshit?  Legit question.
This is why Trump most win! This freak should be in jail!!!!! Biden counter part supports this!
This is correct, media is prepaid. When you buy time online or TV you reserve space on that media. When you cancel you tend have a few days of pre paid media play out while those affiliates resell their ad space. But since this is a headline media only I guess Biden is lying.
A move that shows Biden‚Äôs character, but one, I‚Äôm afraid, that will be interpreted as weakness.
Biden won that debate!
Hey Don, I found this article about how good you are at covering things up, except your mouth of course. #Mask #TrumpHasCovid #MAGA #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #Biden
That‚Äôs actually such a good question because Joe Biden is a leader &amp; a good man &amp; is further demonstrating this by deciding to pull ads. His ads are truth. They expose truths. I personally feel no need to respond to trump‚Äôs Covid w/ compassion, but Joe is a leader &amp; a good man!
Corporation admits in court they
Gov. Christie spent four days indoors with an unmasked Trump team preparing for the debate. VP Biden spent 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump. The WH didn't bother to contact either after Hicks tested positive. They both learned about the outbreak on social media.
Instead Trump catches the Wuhan and Biden  leaves the basement?  That‚Äôs weird : almost like a plan?
Does seem strange huh. Plus Biden didn't get it.
Why wouldn't they test negative for this virus Joe Biden has basically spent this entire campaign in his basement. I don't believe there's a Democrat out there that can tell you the Democratic party's agenda
Chris Wallace is an embarrassment to himself and Fox news. He overshot his self-importance by debating the president of the United States. He was polite and soft on Joe Biden and nasty and rude to my president
For 47 years Joe Biden has accomplished very little, AND THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES.   Thank you for sharing your opinions. I do respect your opinions; however, I do not agree with you. We will just ‚ÄúAgree to disagree‚Äù..
It's been over a year I said,  "under my Command, every Avenue North through Mexico would be annihilated, impassable"... As Biden said, "it's not gonna stop, they're just going to keep coming".
No ones demanding Biden suspend his campaign except maybe Pelosi &amp; other Dems bc they're worried his dumb ass will say something stupid.
This kind of ¬´fact checking¬ª is actively harmful.  He called it a ¬´Democratic hoax¬ª     et al are committing journalistic malpractice and actively spreading disinformation and muddying the waters with a ¬´well akcuslly‚Ä¶!¬ª herr

Prosecuting Hunter Biden, he was going to HOLD THEIR $1B?  Biden is crooked,  he is suffering dementia, and we CERTAINLY DON‚ÄôT NEED A WOMAN LIKE HARRIS RUNNING OUR country.   No, in 47 years, Biden has NOT made many accomplishments. Look again. Biden cannot serve  4 yrs in office
Look what he has done for this Nation. The list is to long to mention.  Please look it up. Again put away your thoughts of the mans attitude, focus on what he has done.  Have you watched the video where Biden told Ukraine if they didn‚Äôt fire the prosecuting attorney ......cont.
So tRump has COVID now?!All these months of POTUS ridiculing us, down playing the virus, crowding in small areas, NO MASKS!   So I wonder if tRump was late to the debate on purpose knowingly knew he had COVID and wanted to give it BIDEN so he could laugh in Biden‚Äôs face #FDT MUW?
Uh, did Biden mention any plans to implement single-payer, universal healthcare coverage for ALL during his first 100 days in office in response to a disease that's claimed nearly a quarter-million lives? If not, shame on him!!!
I wonder why no law enforcement supports Biden?
Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room. He's always the news. In fact you rarely hear anything that Biden is doing while campaigning. I'm sick of this damn monster and want him gone!

Trump hasn't stopped his attack ads.  Why should Biden?
Except his negative ads are still going out, despite Biden campaign pulling their negative ads
Have to believe Biden has an equal bot network. His campaign is dumb as dirt if they don't match fire with fire.

Exactly! The GOP wouldn‚Äôt let up. How do I know? Because they are asking Joe Biden to let up. And they are hypocrites. Look what they did to Obama‚Äôs SCOTUS pick. And look what they are doing now. Lying hypocrites. Don‚Äôt let up, Joe.
We know who Trump is.‚Äù  and we know who Joe Biden is he‚Äôs a man of integrity and respect. that will never change regardless of any racist evil man.‚Äù
Because Joe Biden is a decent,compassionate man and trump is trump.
There won't be any more debates. I can see the audience and Biden ruthlessly going after Trump for knowingly endangering everyone in the first debate.  He can't survive 90 minutes of that.
Another reason this is wrong move.  The very day the Biden campaign did this, the Trump campaign BEGAN running new negative ads against Biden on the Facebook platform .... more are certain to come
Suspicious indeed! That is how bad the Dems want to win, so they can stop all investigations of Biden &amp; Son, so they can dismiss Durham before he can release his report....
U literally complained that he didn‚Äôt stop for questions  Biden‚Äôs had maybe 5 press conferences, but u want Trump with COVID-19 to approach the press with a virus?   You‚Äôd then claim he tried to infect u   You‚Äôre the most incompetent ‚Äújournalist‚Äù ever  #JimAcosta  #Trump2020
She didn't say they should do it, only questioned whether they would? Love the picture of Biden wearing the biggest mask Trump has ever seen.
Nope. CNN did report that Biden removed negative ads while Trump says he won't do the same.
So after attacking his son Hunter &amp; completely dismissing his deceased son Beau, STILL sent this Twt,wished Trump &amp; fam well while spkng in MI,&amp; pulls negative campaign ads.Biden TRULY is a classy,empathetic, genuine human being.While the other isn‚Äôt EVEN a human beingüò°
Not ONCE did i say supported biden But keep deflecting üòÇ. It‚Äôs pathetic and funny
The right brags about not being politically correct and they also wished death on Biden. Saying he was going to die and Trump mocked his dead son and his other sons addiction. But you want me to feel sorry for any of you lmao
Then why do they allow armed idiots like Proud Boys to issue threats to anyone who voted for Biden?
I hear ya, but if you want Biden in the whitehouse be careful what you wish for, because it wouldn't be good
And it gets him out of debates that he simply will never stand up strong against of Biden. And notice trump taxes is out if the headlines. His sinking campaign is the third
The Obama Admin did the same thing w the Bush Admin. Who's to say the Biden Admin wouldn't do the same thing for the Trump Admin? They will!
Hold up... You‚Äôre whining about mask advice given in May, and it‚Äôs Oct 2nd?  If you can remember way back to five days ago, Donald J Cunt was still making fun of Biden‚Äôs mask on sept 29th during the debate Can you honestly call that leadership?
He never said that. Smh geez take a simple statement make it a mountain.    Biden does grab lil girls with no boobs and growing ones. The freak
Biden is a responsible man who follows the advice of scientists. It‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs fault Trump is an irresponsible person who risks his life as well as the live of millions of Americans.
Who cares what Fox News  demands? Biden for President!
Very nice. Please ask her to pray for Joe Biden and his family, who the trump crew may have infected.
I didn‚Äôt vote for Biden in the primary either, but more and more I believe he is what America needs right now.
I mean, he has already been calling Biden that for some time now. My, how the turn tables.
Going well? More than 200,000 dead because of your criminal, incompetent handling of this crisis, and you think it's going well? No. It will be going better, though, after Joe Biden is our President.
The thought of Biden in the presidency tho.. I hope that fuck ass predatory ass bitch die too ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
if i hear someone call biden a radical leftist one more time i SWEAR
And that's not happening. First of all, Biden doesn't determine when or whether the election goes forward. The House does. And the House has no reason whatsoever to postpone the election, especially since early voting has already started.
Literally boasted during the debate (if you can call it that) about how he wears a mask less then Biden
That‚Äôs not an ‚Äúattack‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a recall to reality.  Biden‚Äôs platitudes are noble but completely impossible given the reality of the party he leads.
The Trump campaign just sent out a fundraising email with the subject line "Lyin' Obama." The email goes on to mock Joe Biden for being "asleep in his basement." The Biden campaign, meanwhile, has pulled all negative ads.‚Äù

Trump wouldn't be as gracious if Biden had been positive for covid. The sooner Trump is gone the better we'll all be.
Hell no. Trump wouldn‚Äôt change the date for Biden or anyone else. The date is set for Nov 3rd.
Chris Wallace should never host another Trump/Biden debate! Wallace should go to work for CNN. And Donna Brazile was invited on Fox News after the debate?? She gave debate questions to Hillary..before that debate!! Fox News..are you crazy?!
Joe Biden is a pervert and has dementia. He will not be president. He is a shell of a man and was a horrible Senator and a crappy VP. GIVE IT UP JOE.
Biden is going to wear our his basement!!!!
I am still seeing the neg ads from Biden constantly in Arizona ABC, CBS, &amp; CW
Apparently it was Christie's idea to prevent Joe Biden from speaking. If you've ever watched him talking to the people of New Jersey, the idea is totally believable.
Right. Trump has denounced the White Supremacist and KKK in 2016. They are trying to make Proud Boys to be racist which they are not. But Biden gets a free pass. It is double standards.
Dinesh D‚ÄôSouza on Biden‚Äôs Elizabeth Warren moment

This is exactly the reason Joe and team need to keep their foot on the gas pedal now more than ever and NOT let up!!! Trump will do whatever he can to win, Biden MUST do the same!!!
Seriously! Fuck Biden
I watched the entire thing... Not ONE time did Biden ever mention/say anything about healthcare covering pregnant men. Good lord. Nor did he have a chance to say anything. What a crazy claim.
Biden is the one doing the half quote.
This is hypocrisy at it‚Äôs finest - Trump would never suspend! We suspended on the Supreme Court nominee with Obama, yet when the shoes on the other foot Trump does the opposite?!! Biden should keep his foot on the gas pedal!! FOX News is worthless!!!!
These theories are so incredibly stupid.  It‚Äôs depressing to think that there are the same conspiratorial mindset folks on the left. I always thought they were few in number, but since last night, I acknowledge there is a low-calorie ‚ÄúQAnon Lite‚Äù in the Biden/Harris camp, too.
Just in***Biden tests NEGATIVE for President!
All tax is passed on to the consumer, Any new TAX is a tax on everybody.   If Joe Biden doesn't understand this he should not be President.

Biden‚Äôs campaign collapsing because his voter base gives Trump a sympathy vote is honestly pretty hilarious
republicans not wanting to pass the stimulus bill and Mnuchin's hullunation of V shape  recoveries is moving people to vote for Biden.
Well well well. Now Trump has the virus due to his ignorant and cavalier attitude toward the pandemic. He and his whole family refused to wear masks at the debate and now look. He made fun of Biden for wearing a mask. It‚Äôs hard to feel a lot of sympathy.
It is a stupid suggestion. Biden took the virus seriously and took proper precautions. Nothing highlights that better than him being able to continue campaigning right now.
So you‚Äôre not voting for that racist biden either. Good for you!
And by the way, there‚Äôs absolutely no doubt it would be Dr. Jill Biden‚Äôs honor to prepare the People‚Äôs House for Christmas. Imagine having a real family there again.
This, after a month of Biden lids...
I just don't see the same "we have to stop Pence" momentum working in Biden's favor as the "we have to stop Trump" momentum. AZ would almost certainly go back to a red state, as would a few others. So, these "new swing states" would evaporate. Idk, just my two cents.
Biden has my vote mainly due to the Trump plan to get rid of the funding source for Social Security/Disability/Medicare, which is all dad and I have keeping us alive and with a roof over our heads...Pence isn't likely to make that same cut. I'd still vote against Pence
and without the fear of Trump, many of us who will vote against Trump, may not feel the same urgency to vote against Pence (I would, He's a theocratic fascist as well), which leaves a lot of people at home instead of voting. Biden threw away any chance with the left other than
Honestly, I think the GOP would stand a better chance in November with Pence as their nominee. Normally, he wouldn't be able to win an election, but with Biden on the other side, Pence would take away any moderate Repub votes Biden has been fighting for...1/
Yeah, pretty close. But if Biden gets it a week before and is in the hospital on election day, that's about the worst case scenario.
Welp...Trump sure owned Joe Biden by mocking Joe's mask and choosing not to  wear one. Trump is infected &amp; sick with the Covid "hoax" virus.  Your health along with others well being is not something you gamble with, as he and his cronies are harshly finding out now.
Everything him and his sycophantic fanboys/girls made fun of Biden for especially that mask comment have come back to bite them in the ass in the most delightful of ways ü§£
They got it backwards; Biden would be the one sneaking up from behind
And increase his poll numbers by getting sympathy. Also helps get the horrible debate behavior he exhibited. It also got Biden to remove all the negative ads about Trump. If the rolls were reversed you know Trump wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
Yep. They specifically said they wanted Biden to win. I think they deliberately gave Trump the virus so he would back out if the election. But our president is a fighter and he will get through this and fight till the very end. Trump2020.
Because Hume is a human colostomy bag, and this BS ‚Äúscience‚Äù from the long-discredited AAPS is his attempt at damage control for mocking Joe Biden wearing a mask earlier during the pandemic.  Nonsense, but it plays well w/ the Fox News mouth-breather and geriatric demographics.
Pulling the neg. ads was brilliant. Nate Silver pointed out The press about that, and how it contrasts with the trump campaign is a bigger benefit to Biden‚Äôs campaign than the ads themselves could ever have been.
All his yelling at Biden was him trying to give it to him

Yeah read my original quoted tweet where he calls me a moron.   I asked him to admit he is wrong that NO WAY Biden does one debate.   Always a way have no idea last presidential election that didn't have at least one debate.
Just watched Chris Wallace on our local Fox news broadcast. They are really trying to rehab his reputation.  He says it was Trump fault, no, the questions were setup to help Biden. Nothing they can do will rehab Chris Wallace, in my mind.
Fight the good fight! Good things are coming Nov. 3rd! Biden 2020.
That Trump is being released from hospital because he never tested positive for Covid. It was staged to get people to forget his debate with Biden &amp; gain sympathy to gain in the polls.

Hillary won the college educated white women in 2016 &amp; Biden is increasing that gap. So suburbs are more at ease with Biden. Non college educated white women saw him as the noise and feel it‚Äôs not worth it with him being at the helm. What jobs he brought back from China?
Fuck him. Maybe after 8 months, 208,000 deaths, him mocking Biden for wearing a mask, ignoring Fauci, holding maskless rallies, and putting Americans at risk - him catching COVID will make him take it seriously. Maybe. Possibly.   Suffering is the only way he‚Äôll learn.
Well yeah he did won less votes because most people thought he‚Äôs insane and didn‚Äôt like him. Same was the case with Hillary. IMO polls are underestimating Biden and this isn‚Äôt a close election. Many people just didn‚Äôt turn out last time as they thought Hillary had it in the bag
And Biden attack ads Still running in Arizona against Trump even though he touts they  were pulled
Biden is so frail, he would never make it past COVID. I see the his obvious signs of dementia
He can't "reset the campaign" because Biden is still moving full speed ahead. And only the House has the authority to postpone the election. Oh, and don't mistake simple courtesy for sympathy. What are people supposed to say in response, "Die the most painful death imaginable!"?
Only Fox and Republicans would call for this. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault. He didn‚Äôt follow CDC guidelines. Biden did.

Exactly!  A number of his die-hard supporters voiced dismay after the first debate, some saying they will not vote/vote 4 Biden.
Makes you wonder what was in Joe Biden's "wiring" during the debate.
I would not be surprised.  Hicks tested positive on Thursday. On Wednesday he arrived late to the debate. It seems a convenient excuse not to submit to a test. If this is true, he didn't care if infected Biden.
Based on what Biden said he would have been even two months later than trump - any comment on that Rulon?
Why do you assume Biden had any role in the economic recovery after the real estate collapse? I am sure that Obama claimed the recovery for himself!!!

I‚Äôm actually wondering: was this calculated? Did they know they were infected and decide to try to infect Joe Biden to even the playing field?
I can't imagine telling a Biden volunteer that...
I don‚Äôt care if they all want to go down in one ship but they never should have been allowed to put Joe Biden at risk.
Based on the  all access app, Trump is still a scorching Biden with totally dishonest, negative ads.
China did not allow anyone into China , get it ? They were too busy trying to cover their tracks on their own mess. Biden does not think very clearly and make ridiculous assertions like this one.
This is the Democratic Party!  This is what Biden brings to our America. #Trump2020Landslide
I also think the debate commission should be held liable if Joe Biden is infected since they did not uphold the rules of the debate.
Fair question. I'm a centrist dem. If they were going to turn on Biden, they wouldn't have run ads attacking  *Susan Collins *Lindsey Graham *MitchMcConnell  etc.  They know that the Republican party needs to be burned down.  That's all I'll accept.  PERIOD.  They enabled treason
Give Biden all the ‚Äònone of the above‚Äô votes and the ‚Äòunsure‚Äô votes and it still doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to Trumps WINüòÇ Love this push pole.
Nope. He continues to run negative adds against Biden. Trump would never do that
AZ residents getting these texts. Should be able to stop them. The answer is the most important issue is the fact that Biden is corrupt, senile and an imbecile. Fact, not an opinion.
Biden  choose  the safe, sound and scientific approach towards pandemic precaution. Whereas his opponent chose reckless disregard  of the risks and for the safety of Americans. Bad choices have bad consequences. Case closed. Wall Street is going to love Biden by the way.
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia are tricky states. In my opinion they can either way but I feel Biden has an advantage in Florida and Ohio  and Trump has an advantage in Georgia . Texas in my opinion can very likely go for Biden but I may be completely wrong

BREAKING: Americans involved in early voting said it would not stop voting for Joe Biden. #ImVotingForJoe  #ImVotingForBiden
Absolutely. I just watched on the news how he made fun of Biden at the debate saying wherever you see Biden he is wearing the biggest mask that he has ever seen. Karma. He should have put that mask on and not kept it in his pocket like I said and you said Karma
guess i‚Äôm voting joe biden
She would be out telling the public what those two did to Middle East and home  False flag shootings  . She hates Obama and do did I Biden was a side kick so NO BIDEN you don‚Äôt know him !
Yeah, just like Biden would be if he ever got elected. PUPPET MAN!
Such assholes. The truth is that Biden will win no matter what. Murdoch needs to shut his network down and retire somewhere.
Kick the Virus's ass so you can come back and kick Biden's ass
If my mom were alive she would be out publicly speaking against Biden Cue to Obama Administration I don‚Äôt know why anyone would vote for a VP who  talks evil against President Sisi . That is a  a deep hurt to me.
Did he know he was already infected but wanted to do the debate and "kick Bidens ass"? Well he failed to kick Biden's ass and now he is very ill. The timeline is too tight.
Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Who Tripled and Still Lost the Afghan War, Endorses Biden, Says He Listens to His Military Betters Better  via
For any liberal , leftist, moderate or any Biden voters or supporters remember that Trump and his base are relentless . They are unapologetic about attacking , harassing , being racist, sexist, cruel. So.. NEVER FEEL SORRY FOR TRUMP OR HIS SUPPORTERS. He gets what he deserves
Hey you know who didn‚Äôt get airlifted to a hospital today ? Joe Biden
After all of the hypocrisy and evil coming from Trump and his supporters, should Biden and his supporters play nice or play dirty like Trump has?
Prove it! I have statements from Biden that show he is a racist. Go look up and follow Leo Terrell, David Webb, Larry Elders or Candace Owens. Ask them if they are racist and weather or Trump is a racist. By the way, they are all black. Do some research, you might learn something
Clearly Biden is the better human, but we knew that
But it also shows at Joe Biden is a very classy man and is a true leader
I believe it‚Äôs very simple.  The Biden campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to move is empathy.  The Trump campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to moves are mockery and self-adulation.
Of course. It makes Biden look tougher than the fragile ego of the President.
Ok well said Mr. Biden
Omg I they text me today and I told them never support a Biden/Harris ticket and voting Mcsally as she should have beat Sinema!
you know Trump is lose on early election number. Trump 38% and Biden 55% and the  will put you down and in jail
While Biden has said he hopes Trump gets well, &amp; pulled "contrast" ads, on this day 4 years ago Trump &amp; his supporters mocked Clinton for getting pneumonia.  But, of course, Trumpanistas today are demanding we show respect to Trump because he's made himself sick.
Trump has always been a bully. He deserves NO SYMPATHY or special treatment in the final month of the election. He wouldn't give Biden any special treatment. #VoteHimOut  (I have to say I'm disappointed that Ivanka &amp; Jared tested negative.)
Oh you want us to pretend Trump supporters didn‚Äôt laugh at the idea of Biden dying before Election Day. Or how he was not going to make it and be replaced. Is that what you want us to do karen
Why should Biden suspend ?. He took all precautions wearing masks and maintaining social distance etc while the President of the US was actively disparaging Biden for campaigning from basement and wearing masks .
Agreed! The Trump campaign said they‚Äôre not stopping, so why should Biden!
The same way the right was laughing at the idea of Biden dying before Election Day. Give it to the Right for being a bunch of hypocritical sissies
Don't forget the shit he said about Hunter at the debate while Biden was talking about Beau. They are so disrespectful, even through times like this.
Biden is a good decent classy man. He‚Äôs exactly what we want for President. I ain‚Äôt mad at him.
This makes me even more enthusiastic for Biden for this moment. His focus on relationships. Bringing people together.
You mean how the Right was literally saying Biden was going to die before election. You guys are morons. Now that Trump is the one at risk of lying you can‚Äôt handle the backlash
Oh stop. The right has been wishing For Biden‚Äôs death. Saying he wasn‚Äôt going to make it to election. Karma you snowflake. Now you can‚Äôt handle the comments. What are your feelings hurt
As Biden and his team go high, you go low...class act üëé
Hell no. Biden should not suspend anything. No retreat. Never surrender.üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
I miss the old Biden/Obama memes from the 2017 transition.
The dummies are showing biden with a ‚Äújesuit‚Äù. Every evangelical living will never , ever vote for him.  The jesuits are at the top of the food chain for the left. Morons, absolute morons!
This might help explain why Biden tested negative, while Trump is in a hospital bed at Walter Reed.

You crazy Biden campaign even pulled their negative ads about him right now. #realpeople #empathy #DonaldTrump #BidensUnitingUS #GetWellSoon
that's great joe biden.  don't forget we want M4A, GND and debt forgiveness.
I just saw a negative Biden ad.
Joe Biden looked up and thought it was Uranus...üòú
Stupid. His negative adds aren‚Äôt pulled vs Joe. Running ever 2 seconds in AZ. Got a lady hiding under the bed calling 911 in Joe Biden America. All footage courtesy of current Trump America.
I think it's smart. He knows Trump wouldn't pull his. It makes Biden look like the adult, a leader.
Request to Biden. Can he please start wearing an n95? The surgical masks and cloth covers have less protection against airborne particles. It might have been mocked by Trump before, but now it seems necessary considering Trump x2, Hicks, Conway, McDaniel, Lee, Tillis, and more.
My opinion: with Trump sidelined for the next two weeks, Biden has a golden opportunity over the next week to really hammer home his vision of a post-Trump America and meeting the national challenges that go beyond repairing our divisions and the damage of the past few years.
Clearly Biden's a far better human than anyone in tRump's campaign.  Given that campaign's response, I say put back those negative ads!
But Biden has stated clearly his condemnation of the violence associated with any peaceful demonstrations
I Watched the debate. What part of my comment do you disagree with? I was answering why they call Biden by his former tithe title of VP. I also eluded to the fact he has stated more than once he is running for Senator. I tied it together to say VP reminded Joe who he is.
Biden would never agree to it. But I would love to see each person forced to answer every question one t a time non loaded questions.
You mean the one that Biden confirmed and said, "he will make a fine AG"?
Hey asshole, Biden's not laying in Walter Reed either!
Joe Biden looked up and thought it was Uranus....üòú

Yes. Despite everything they've done and all the rigging, they would mean he would have run a different campaign. as Biden said "I'm the Democrat party". Progressives might actually realize their leverage / power. They could restructure. Definitely move in the right direction
Trump should repay taxes and penalties, appear in all court cases, appear before congress, stop trying to steal another justice appointment, give DNA in sexual assault cases, face charges for not divesting his businesses. Etc.  Then we'll talk to Biden. Oh, and quit lying!

Nope. Personal irresponsibility by Trump &amp; his policy makers during a deadly pandemic is very much a matter of politics. Biden/Harris must win to defeat the coronavirus &amp; restore our democracy. Keep being aggressive politically. Victory is a must.
Live updates: Trump at hospital after positive coronavirus test; Kellyanne Conway, two senators test positive - The Washington Post
Why does Biden need to keep going on the attack 24/7 when the T---p campaign keeps making error after error? Time for the Biden campaign to play up what it wants to do for 2021-2024.
Biden chose the safe, sound and scientific proven pandemic precautions. Trump chose recklessness. Bad choices have bad consequences. Chris Wallace is a man. How about start acting like Americans for crying out loud?
Former Vice President Joe Biden and others around President Trump have tested negative for COVID-19 ‚Äì but that doesn't mean they're totally in the clear, experts said Friday.

But Trump was disrespectful to Biden as well and he is a Vice President. I don‚Äôt understand
There is a long history showing Biden has a speech impediment, a stuffer. To reframe it as dementia is ableist and goes to show how low Trump and his supporters will go because they are desperate and can't argue on the facts.

Biden would have rolled out in a wheelchair and the left would have cheered him on for being brave. Fuck that. Trump 2020
yet the Trump campaign continues to post fake videos of BidenSure you would.......you have Biden/Harris in your profile.
It‚Äôs clear that Fox News wants your viewers to completely turn you off. Chris Wallace talks about transparency and honesty. Why was he playing cover for Joe Biden at the debate interrupting the president. He knows the history of Joe Biden how he interrupts lies
Maybe you can start by denouncing Biden for speaking at an ‚Äúexalted cyclop‚Äôs‚Äù funeral.. Democratic senator Robert Byrd. Everyone is aware the Democratic Party is the party of the KKK.
Looks like a White House guy, quick get more pics...vote Biden!
At least Biden isn‚Äôt out spreading virus like Trump did.
You knew you had virus on Wednesday morning. Did you find out even earlier like before debate?  Did you hope to give it to Biden?  Asking for 80 million Americans
I don‚Äôt think he needs to tell you does he.. why don‚Äôt you tell us about Biden‚Äòs health. If Biden were president right now if he catches Covid it will kill him instantly. We don‚Äôt need a man as president who could die at the drop of a hat
These failed propagandists at the Lincoln project ask a very important question. The Lincoln project is pushing to have a 78yr Biden run our country. Who at  the drop of a hat could die push our country into chaos. Chaos they‚Äôre claiming right now. See how they lie!

What‚Äôs even stranger is 11 people who were at the debate have tested positive for COVID-19. Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt tested positive he is the one person at the debate with all of his pre-existing conditions that should‚Äôve caught it if it was naturally being spread!
11 people at the debate that were supposedly tested before hand. Have now tested positive for COVID-19. One of them is not Joe Biden who is the target of this disease he should be the first one coming down with it if it was spread naturally.. Who administering these tests
Every time reporters point out different aspects of how this could‚Äôve possibly happened to the president and first lady. You are pointing out that there are gigantic flaws in testing..mask wearin..distancing..mainly testing darling. This is exposing Joe Biden‚Äòs mantra is crap
You do know what a secret service agents job is correct? Everyday their life is on the line ..you are a moron you write moronic garbage to the lowest form of life! There‚Äôs a secret service agent that just about punched Joe Biden out for trying to feel up his wife..explain that!
Jill Biden wearing a mask today speaking fiddling with mask entire time, so if she touches her eyes, face, etc, before a good cleanse or sanitize, what a waste, you can only put it on, take off, no touching when on, dumb dems
Coronavirus ain‚Äôt going away until we change president. This one we have is clueless. Joe Biden will do the work and follow the scientists advise.
She seems to be suffering from the same mental declines as Biden. She had a difficult time expressing why they were there. Now we‚Äôre seeing that #Liberalism destroys compassion as it destroys the brain. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
And It's Biden with dementia, shouldn't he resign? You're kind of yucky, huh?
Remember when Hillary fell while getting into her campaign bus? Trump campuses that for propaganda. So I think Biden is a decent person but should still campaign with caution and run ads.
Joe Biden is smarter not to listen to their stupid demands. Who is Fox News again? Come again Please!
Joe Biden needs to understand that science is discovery never ending discovery. You don‚Äôt yell sirens at a virus and make it go away.

If Joe Biden caught COVID-19 with all of his call morbidities his multiple aneurysms his asthma and God only knows what else is wrong with him. He would be one of those in the 200,000 category deceased! Thank God he is not our president during this pandemic

Donald Trump won the debate. Donald Trump has numerous times rejected white supremacists. Joe Biden would not reject the terrorists in our street or name any law-enforcement that support him. Any reporter that complains about interrupting and speaking over someone is dishonest

Smart 4D chess move. Trump has obviously contracted COVID to take out Biden tonight. #Debates2020
Let's be honest - so is Biden.  They're both geriatric AF. Past bedtime.
Trump four years of history..Hillary/Joe Biden have at least 100 yrs combined. They are the government they are the tax laws they don‚Äôt like.. they are the racist discrimination people marching in the streets against.. the government t the lawmakers!!They are the scum!
Crazy Trump Alert for an hour and the half. Watch out Biden. Crazy Trump is coming with Lies.

Drinking game:  Take a shot whenever Trump sniffs or Biden stutters.  We'll be dead 10 minutes in!
Biden will have to wear earmuffs tonight, everyone will be starring at his ears.
Set up an S Corp. to hide a half mil..how does one  get $16 million in two years? How do you do that when you‚Äôre in government your whole damn life? When did Joe Biden create anything that helped anyone? We know about his crime bill that ruined the black community what else jimbo
You'll never see a clip of Biden longer than 3 seconds than all are spiced together.  Try it, watch and count.
We will hold Trump feet to the fire tonight. Trump is a kitten for Biden. Aspects more lies and misinformation from trump tonight.
Joe Biden has released his 2019 tax returns. C‚ÄôMon Crooked Trump show us your real tax returns if you have balls. Real Balls!!! ü§£üòÇ
Joe Biden needs to be treated just as he treated Clarence Thomas disrespectfully. Called out on his touching and feeling of women and children. He‚Äôs a disgusting disgrace!
Joe Biden wasn't President for the last 4 years, Trump was and look at the state we're in.
Joe Biden is requesting a break every 30 minutes in a 90 minute debate. He needs a break every 30 minutes to get rehydrated because the stimulants he‚Äôs on will dehydrate him very quickly especially under the lights of a stage. Drug test him!
Looks like to me ppl seeking opportunity with clear eyes clear mind. The fog of the leftist propaganda garbage lifting from minds as they see you push the racist bigoted segregationist Biden try to pretend he‚Äôs honest. Known plagiarist liar!
this fake conversation about how Joe Biden should be treated and should he be respected how many opportunities should he be given. This is how Joe Biden should be treated the exact way he treated Clarence Thomas he‚Äôs a disgusting disgraceful racist..
I understand that the streets in Cleveland Ohio are vacated wboarded up windows in anticipation of the  Democrats Joe Biden‚Äôs violent tribes comng downtown to destroy  burn loo murder...
Flashback: Clarence Thomas responds to Anita Hill  via            everyone speculates how Biden should be treated in these debates? Answer
Joe Biden will do any disgusting disgraceful thing to be admired by the worst of us!
Joe Biden is going to spend the day hooked up to IVs vitamin B 12 hydration hangover drips. Before he takes his anti-depressants stimulants!
Joe Biden‚Äôs thinks that little girls are there for him to touch fondle molest in front of their parents
You have no credibility visiting Angel... Joe Biden‚Äôs will need his meds about 7:30 PM sharp
Ur questions to Goodwin about schools opening during this pandemic. The swine flu attacked children specifically pregnant women the elderly with pre-existing conditions. My children were in school Barnicle they didn‚Äôt close nobody stayed home Biden a complete fail!
G Kyle. How interesting that the president would share information with the public that has to do with our department of justice and the criminal activity that took place with the Obama Biden administration and the FBI. What‚Äôs your profession again? Deceiver propagandist?!!
I loved your visiting angels moment with Joe Biden. I‚Äôm just glad he didn‚Äôt ask you to bathe him on television..Dispense medications. Your helpful hints were quite entertaining! That‚Äôs what we will call you from now on ..helpful hints!
The interesting part of that story is Donald Trump is a businessman. Hunter Biden is a drug addict
When was the last time Biden was forbidden from operating a charitable foundation in the state of New York?
Do you approve of Joe and Jill Biden setting up an S Corp to hide a half million from their book sales?!!! Does that meet with your standards?
Somebody‚Äôs got to pay Putin back they‚Äôre giving all their money to Hunter Biden.. see how that works they use our tax dollars to give to foreign countries as aid. Then Joe flies around with Hunter and Hunter takes all of itNo sympathy votes for Trump. Wish him well but vote Biden. EVEN if Pence is the nominee , vote Biden!!
No, here‚Äôs the truth. Your boy Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a large bathroom with supporters. Yes there were empty seats but he still outdraws Biden a thousand to one. How do you like that fact?
Your boy Biden can‚Äôt fill a large bathroom  with supporters. Every Trump rally has been gigantic. That‚Äôs what worries you. What worries me is... you think ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again‚Äù and respecting the flag by showing it... is propaganda. Spin that A hole.
Biden and his Wife tested negative for covid. Trump and his wife didn‚Äôt. So Trump is at a hospital with covid and his wife is home with hers. Sad
You are blaming COVID on Trump?  Trump stopped travel from China is January and was called a "Xenophobe" by you leftists, Pelosi and Biden.  What say you about Pelosi inviting people in her district to parade in Feb?
Also, go look up some of the stuff Biden has said about people of color. You'll be mindblown
So vote Biden and Co in so we can enjoy more months of lockdowns and also socialism.
And this is why Biden must continue to show he is better. The racist are still energized
Kyrsten.  Please talk to GOP Senators.   Use your bipartisan skills.  Convince GOP senators to endorse Biden, and vote against Trump.  You‚Äôre too nice to Trump and McConnell.  Don‚Äôt be.  Get mean.
He would increase them and Call Biden weak for catching it.
The Biden‚Äôs are almost to the White House!!!üòÑüòÑüëçüòõ
Joe (Ann Green / Biden)
Why Joe Biden can't expect to automatically get the #Latino vote  via  Just don't get why any Latino, person of color or woman, would vote for Trump. Are they not paying attention?
The Republicans will be too busy jamming Corey Barrett on to the supreme court before they are defeated bigly Nov. 3.  So much for democracy.  Biden will have a tough time repairing the damage that has been done in the past four years.
If you can't vote this year just vote for Joe Biden in 2024.
Tbh I still think Hillary lost more than Trump won. I don‚Äôt think Biden has that same hate but who knows
How much do you want to bet that the Trump administration knew Trump was infected with the vrius before the debate and decided that if Trump already had it, might as well infect Biden with it as well. Cuz you know thats how Trump's brain works
This is a lie...
More likely they know Biden is just a figurehead for Nancy Pelosi to use as a puppet for her own evil wishes. We all fell for California‚Äôs peace and love hippy bs never realizing they were a liberal Trojan horse
You don't think Basement dweller Biden isn't "RACIST" üò°
These people have no scruples, they would absolutely lie under oath. Frankly who gives a damn? Either biden wins or we're fucked. We can return to this distracting bs after the election.
The pot calling the kettle black. Biden is the one who needs to denounce white supremacy.
Did you all hear no one showed up in Nevada today for the Harris/Biden event to get out the vote??  Nevada is going red!  Sick of these DEMONrats like that Sissy Governor ruining the economy!
This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.
In your humble opinion is Joe Biden a Globalist or America First?
Let‚Äôs remember to keep Biden and his campaign Top priority! #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020 #BidensUnitingUS
Because shitty people stick with shitty people. And Biden, Obama, Hillary, Harris offered their condolences right away.
Why your family does not do anything nice for people. Name calling, smears, lies, maybe if the Trumps were nicer it would help. Donny j. Trump has no empathy.  If it was Biden wonder what mean thing your daddy would say.
I would not doubt that Trump tried to infect Joe Biden and his wife. Combined with his sense of invulnerability it seems entirely possible.
Traitors. If our country goes down if God forbid Biden wins. You can add your names to the list of traitors responsible for our downfall.
And my best friend, her daughter, and her husband all registered and are voting Biden. First time for all of them- and the husband was a Trump supporter...
I am nervous about Biden. The more news we get about how Trump and his staff handled this  ugh.
That‚Äôs what class looks like Mr. Trump. Take notes now or from your hotel when Biden moves into the White House but please take notes!!
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
If this thing was actually highly contagious don‚Äôt you think Biden would‚Äôve gotten it or is going to get it? This should be an eye opener
The man who tried to invoke Biden‚Äôs stuttering through cruelty earns him zero sympathy. Get the ventilator ready for the big man.
Hope you guys added Biden to list. Looking like he could very well have been exposed w Trumps avoiding pre debate test, # of debate workers now sick. Registered GOP, who will be unglued if Simon the Sorcerer (Trump) negligent attitude costs Biden.
Lol, get serious. Trump has been campaigning for four years. Biden has three years to go to catch up. Hypocrisy rules Republicans!
The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Richard Spencer Reiterates Support for Biden, Disavows 'Useless' and 'Traitorous' GOP  #DNCPolicies
Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
just saw video of Boris Johnson sending well wishes to Trump, and he was wearing a "Build Back Better" hard hat. That was also on the equipment in the background. Biden stole their slogan from London!
Why does the media continue to cover Trump‚Äôs condition when all they can say is that they have no information? Please cover Biden all day and cut in with breaking news if they release anything concrete!  Dear Lord! How many times can they say they don‚Äôt know?
just saw video of Boris Johnson on jobsite wearing a Build Back Better hard hat.  that was also on the equipment in the background. Biden Campaign stole slogan from London!
You don‚Äôt get it do you? Trump just took any and all attention away from Biden. He will dominate the news with this and Biden will fade.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
I would be the first to say that Dem party overall needs to find commom cause with pro-life/anti-abortion folks.  Despite that, these pro-life evangelicals for Biden understand that soooooo much more is on the line this election.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
That debate should have been stopped because of that. If Biden gets sick, whoa Nellie. I think the country will become unglued. This selfish selfish selfish man has been COVIDs #1 supporter thru his handling and minimizing of this crisis.
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
About same troop levels, no major new wars, and failing coups.   My thought was where do we want our problems.  Home:Trump  Abroad:Democrats  Not voting for Trump or Biden but I still think it holds true and would rather have to face our problems here
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Biden wasn‚Äôt going to say anything about his plan, Wallace hates Trump, how do you prepare? Trump got Biden to denounce the violence and say he doesn‚Äôt support the NGDü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biden should lose 1/3 of the DNC support for those 2 things, the new taxes should do the rest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
Expanded Hours! Our office is open today and Sunday, Oct. 3-4, from 9 to 4. Pick up yard signs (out of Biden/Harris) and please consider doing a no-contact lit drop for candidates. We're at: 290 S Alma School Rd, Suite 15, Chandler (please wearüò∑)
While not quarantining, Biden generally displays very Covid-safe behavior and I'm sure he's doing even more now.  I trust his judgement that he won't be flippant about it.
Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Sorry, that comment was towards Biden, not you. My mistake. Stay safe my fellow patriot.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
This is about as silly as the ridiculous Biden had an earpiece nonsense.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump Vs Biden Debate, Our Thoughts  via  #WalkAway #VoteRed #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
No Biden shouldn‚Äôt cancel anything.trump would be making fun of him just like he did Hillary.
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Biden better be #maninabubble
The current news cycle focused on Trump‚Äôs prognosis and the numbers of infected Republicans from last week‚Äôs super spreader events is the most effective negative ad Biden could hope for, and it‚Äôs costing him nothing.
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I hope he does, at least with him, we know what we‚Äôre up against and know we can beat him. I don‚Äôt want to lose all the Republicans for Biden.
Biden oversaw the longest stretch of job growth in American history. Obama/Biden added more NEW jobs in their last 3 years than Trump did in his first 3. Then he crashed the economy and will leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. Get your facts straight.
I have no fucks to give to Trump, Biden needs to double down and destroy #IdiotInChief Trump. We need a leader in this country not a fucking self centered micro Dick motherfucker.
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering
The same day Biden and Harris are here. So very cute of Mikey
Trump campaign will keep posting negative adds about VP Biden. No class from Trump, none at all. Vote nov 3rd.
Even Joe Biden is sympathetic towards President Trump. I‚Äôve seen so many ‚ÄúDeath to Trump‚Äù tweets. Grow the fuck up!!
Go Joe Biden President üòÅ
I know this is a year old but the fact that most people don‚Äôt really pay attention to it is interesting. You really think he has changed?
Chris Wallace spoon fed Biden answers and repulsed me with his Trump attacks! Can‚Äôt go through this again.
Only if Biden wins
Lots of people hoping trump dies BUT what I‚Äôve been hoping is both trump &amp; biden test positive, neither of them die but they get pretty sick and realize the stress of the presidency is not worth the physical toll on their bodies.  Bernie then steps up. We live happily ever after.
. if Putin is a Trump surrogate how come Biden's son is the one getting paid by Russia, China and the Ukraine?  Sounds to me like you're running cover for Biden's corruption so how much is your "take"?
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.
Fact check: Trump campaign runs Facebook ads featuring fake image of Biden wearing earpiece

The Trump-Biden Stakes: Your Life Savings
It potentially benefits him. But this is too elaborate and risky to be a hoax. It actually hurts him politically also. He loves to tweet, and hold rallies. He loves to be in front of camera. He's a narcissist. No way he'd be okay hiding out while Biden campaigns.
This is why Trump most win! This freak should be in jail!!!!! Biden counter part supports this!

Why didn't they show the crowd in Biden's grand Rapids rally?
Both Cindy and John are voting for Biden
So tRump has COVID now?!All these months of POTUS ridiculing us, down playing the virus, crowding in small areas, NO MASKS!   So I wonder if tRump was late to the debate on purpose knowingly knew he had COVID and wanted to give it BIDEN so he could laugh in Biden‚Äôs face #FDT MUW?
Here is a thoughtful and prayerful reflection from the bishop of El Paso, Texas. Bishop Seitz: Single-issue voting has corrupted Christian political witness
Except his negative ads are still going out, despite Biden campaign pulling their negative ads
Have to believe Biden has an equal bot network. His campaign is dumb as dirt if they don't match fire with fire.
Exactly! The GOP wouldn‚Äôt let up. How do I know? Because they are asking Joe Biden to let up. And they are hypocrites. Look what they did to Obama‚Äôs SCOTUS pick. And look what they are doing now. Lying hypocrites. Don‚Äôt let up, Joe.
Because Joe Biden is a decent,compassionate man and trump is trump.
I hear ya, but if you want Biden in the whitehouse be careful what you wish for, because it wouldn't be good
The Obama Admin did the same thing w the Bush Admin. Who's to say the Biden Admin wouldn't do the same thing for the Trump Admin? They will!
Who cares what Fox News  demands? Biden for President!
Going well? More than 200,000 dead because of your criminal, incompetent handling of this crisis, and you think it's going well? No. It will be going better, though, after Joe Biden is our President.
And they say boy what a great job your doing. You could have invaded oregon and killed millions but you didnt. Dems whining about 210,000 dead from covid and Hunter Biden is getting money from Russia.More than Putin give me or my campaign.
This is exactly the reason Joe and team need to keep their foot on the gas pedal now more than ever and NOT let up!!! Trump will do whatever he can to win, Biden MUST do the same!!!
Seriously! Fuck Biden
Biden is the one doing the half quote.
This is hypocrisy at it‚Äôs finest - Trump would never suspend! We suspended on the Supreme Court nominee with Obama, yet when the shoes on the other foot Trump does the opposite?!! Biden should keep his foot on the gas pedal!! FOX News is worthless!!!!
This, after a month of Biden lids...
Yeah, pretty close. But if Biden gets it a week before and is in the hospital on election day, that's about the worst case scenario.
Everything him and his sycophantic fanboys/girls made fun of Biden for especially that mask comment have come back to bite them in the ass in the most delightful of ways ü§£
And increase his poll numbers by getting sympathy. Also helps get the horrible debate behavior he exhibited. It also got Biden to remove all the negative ads about Trump. If the rolls were reversed you know Trump wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
All his yelling at Biden was him trying to give it to him
Yeah read my original quoted tweet where he calls me a moron.   I asked him to admit he is wrong that NO WAY Biden does one debate.   Always a way have no idea last presidential election that didn't have at least one debate.
That Trump is being released from hospital because he never tested positive for Covid. It was staged to get people to forget his debate with Biden &amp; gain sympathy to gain in the polls.
You were never voting for Biden. #WearADamnMask
Hillary won the college educated white women in 2016 &amp; Biden is increasing that gap. So suburbs are more at ease with Biden. Non college educated white women saw him as the noise and feel it‚Äôs not worth it with him being at the helm. What jobs he brought back from China?
Well yeah he did won less votes because most people thought he‚Äôs insane and didn‚Äôt like him. Same was the case with Hillary. IMO polls are underestimating Biden and this isn‚Äôt a close election. Many people just didn‚Äôt turn out last time as they thought Hillary had it in the bag

Really no way Biden gets on stage and debates?
Based on what Biden said he would have been even two months later than trump - any comment on that Rulon?
Fair question. I'm a centrist dem. If they were going to turn on Biden, they wouldn't have run ads attacking  *Susan Collins *Lindsey Graham *MitchMcConnell  etc.  They know that the Republican party needs to be burned down.  That's all I'll accept.  PERIOD.  They enabled treason
Nope. He continues to run negative adds against Biden. Trump would never do that
Way more than Obama and Biden ever gave out in Economic Relief payments,.
Maybe this is why they want Biden to stop campaigning.
Biden ain't Trump. But I hear you.
You mean, if Biden were an idiot. He is not.
Kellyanne Conway?  Is this an alternative fact?  Live updates: Trump at hospital after positive coronavirus test; Kellyanne Conway tests positive
guess i‚Äôm voting joe biden
Yeah, just like Biden would be if he ever got elected. PUPPET MAN!
Prove it! I have statements from Biden that show he is a racist. Go look up and follow Leo Terrell, David Webb, Larry Elders or Candace Owens. Ask them if they are racist and weather or Trump is a racist. By the way, they are all black. Do some research, you might learn something
I believe it‚Äôs very simple.  The Biden campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to move is empathy.  The Trump campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to moves are mockery and self-adulation.
Of course. It makes Biden look tougher than the fragile ego of the President.
Don't forget the shit he said about Hunter at the debate while Biden was talking about Beau. They are so disrespectful, even through times like this.
I miss the old Biden/Obama memes from the 2017 transition.
that's great joe biden.  don't forget we want M4A, GND and debt forgiveness.
I just saw a negative Biden ad.
Stupid. His negative adds aren‚Äôt pulled vs Joe. Running ever 2 seconds in AZ. Got a lady hiding under the bed calling 911 in Joe Biden America. All footage courtesy of current Trump America.
I think it's smart. He knows Trump wouldn't pull his. It makes Biden look like the adult, a leader.
Clearly Biden's a far better human than anyone in tRump's campaign.  Given that campaign's response, I say put back those negative ads!
Hey asshole, Biden's not laying in Walter Reed either!
.  if joe biden won the election he would be inheriting a white house full of covid19 to welcome him.  .
.  why did joe biden pull out his negative ads?  .
Yes. Despite everything they've done and all the rigging, they would mean he would have run a different campaign. as Biden said "I'm the Democrat party". Progressives might actually realize their leverage / power. They could restructure. Definitely move in the right direction
Trump should repay taxes and penalties, appear in all court cases, appear before congress, stop trying to steal another justice appointment, give DNA in sexual assault cases, face charges for not divesting his businesses. Etc.  Then we'll talk to Biden. Oh, and quit lying!
Dear God, you people are vile and every day you show us how great Biden is by comparison.
Live updates: Trump at hospital after positive coronavirus test; Kellyanne Conway, two senators test positive - The Washington Post
Why does Biden need to keep going on the attack 24/7 when the T---p campaign keeps making error after error? Time for the Biden campaign to play up what it wants to do for 2021-2024.
But Trump was disrespectful to Biden as well and he is a Vice President. I don‚Äôt understand
Pure. Class. #JoeBiden2020 #TrumpCovid   Joe Biden Pulls Campaign Ads As Donald Trump Heads to Hospital for COVID-19 Treatment
Biden don‚Äôt stop your path to be president. Keep your focus and win. Trump is a liar and a racist. Remember he will sting you like the snake that he is..
Cos Biden has class!
Agreed! I cant stand Biden, or Obama. But would never wish ill health on them. I hope Trump has a speedy recovery.
Interesting that you believed the lies lol.  The men he allegedly said this about stepped forward and said no such thing happened. Nothing on video or recording. But we do see and hear Biden calling them stupid bastards and dull
to say she's defending white supremacists just shows how ignorant and uneducated you are. You are aware of Biden's racism problems? Strom Thurmond, Robert Byrd both klansmen, 1984 crime bill, calling black kids roaches...
I live in blue midtown Phoenix, and just drove to the red ‚Äòburbs for wedding. Saw two Republicans for Biden billboards fr. two different orgs. No Trump.   There is board in central Phoenix which says ‚ÄúTrump will stop the rioting &amp; looting.‚Äù There‚Äôs no rioting/looting here. Dumb.
Trump has denounced White Supremacy over a dozen time. You guys are bent on a failing talking point. Give it a rest already. It's not like Trump called a klansman a mentor (nope, that was Joe Biden who did that)
Been seeing negative ads about Biden all day in AZ. Sick of the high road, fight back!
British member of Parliament nominates Biden for a Nobel Peace Prize | TheHill
Seriously and fuck both Norquist for spreading it and Biden for taking up the mantel
Interesting question!  What about all the ‚ÄúRepublicans for Biden‚Äù voters, too. 100% of the ones I know would prefer Pence over all others, but their votes could be locked into ‚Äúnot Trump‚Äù space ü§î
Biden is out campaigning. Don isn‚Äôt. Win.
Of course they did . . . .
You too , it was actually good to hear your POV and barrel back and for, we do have a choice like 2016 of who is the better of 2 evils.  I‚Äôm pretty sure Biden lost the election in the debate by not supporting the NGD, his statement on the violence,saying he will shut US down
Joe Biden will get the virus under control, save lives and bring back our economy. Pass it on.
All because President S**t-for-brains didn't wear a mask and taunted Biden for wearing one???      Fox News ain't thinking this one through (as usual). Trump's numbers will go up if he has a thermometer in his gob and not flapping his gums.
curious question  suppose trump dies from this and i dont wish it, obviously pence would become president but would the election go on with pence as the R nominee? Also would this mean you would throw biden under the bus and back pence since its no longer trump?
I am a real, imperfect Catholic. I am voting for Joe Biden. This sums up so much of how I feel about those who make abortion the litmus test for a candidate. | Jeannie Gaffigan: My loved ones told me ‚Äòreal‚Äô Catholics vote for Trump. Here‚Äôs my response.
Translation, calculated negative ads would hurt Harris-Biden ticket
Then Biden‚Äôs ‚Äústaff‚Äù should keep the negative ads on the air.
who do you think those ads appeal to? we know the base is set. Biden is making the right call imo, but I get where you are coming from.
Karma. He stood at the debate making fun of Joe Biden for the large size mask that he wears and that he wears it even when he doesn't need to. Clearly, Trump should have been appreciative of this. And Trump weighs 244 lb not the weight that was quoted at his so-called physical.
It also does not mean they are taking down advertising period. The ads are still there just the positive Joe Biden ones.

The difference is that there‚Äôs really nothing negative in Biden ads, they‚Äôre facts.  Trump ads are based on conspiracy theories and spin
Name one thing Biden has done in 47 yrs in govt to help the American citizens, other than enrich his family
you do realize I'm vehemently anti Biden, correct? #NeolibsAreTheDisease #TrumpIsTheSymptom #EndTheDuopoly #NeverBiden idk how someone can be #BLM and advocate for Captain Crime Bill and the Cop.  But if you're cool with it I dont mind the follow.
Biden has pulled all negative ads. Trump released one today about the conspiracy that Biden wore a mic during the debate. Fox can demand whatever they want, but they will get nothing.
While Biden takes down negative adds regarding Trump's handling of the virus, Trump campaign continues negative after negative add against Biden regarding law and order.  I am seeing 10 a day here in Arizona full of reps of police unions.
Donald Trump has put antifa and the KKK as domestic terrorist organizations. You can repeat the lie as many times as you want but facts don't care about your feelings. Trump never paled around with klan recruiters unlike Biden.
Disregarding the Constitution is Trump's game, not Biden's. Glad to see you care nothing at all for the Constitution of the U.S.
Biden nobody wants to hear from you!
Biden was a citizen moron.
when you're done with Michael Moore  go back and do some Hunter Biden,  then we'll switch to HRC and Benghazi
This also disturbed me a great deal. It also disturbs me that Biden called the late KKK leader Robert Byrd his friend and mentor. I wish great candidates could emerge that would unite us. How nice to anxiously go vote without plugging our noses!
Biden is a disgusting human as well. Why do you care? You're from Austrailia. I wish I had a better candidate. But I don't so I will go for a businessman, not a loser in politics for 47 years.
We used to eat up those Biden and Obama memes and now we hate him. Growth.
Biden needs to put them back up.
Mine did. And, I went back to sleep and got the best rest in nearly 4 years.  My thoughts? Tube him, let him lay there until after the election when we can get Biden voted into office. The nation would do just fine, without his tweeting and divisive words.
Biden absolutely need to stay the course
Watch "Former VP Joe Biden pulls all negative campaign ads" on YouTube
Maybe Wallace thinks Biden will win now that Trump has Covid? Wallace is a yes man to the liberals. Disgusting human.
With Joe Biden, China Is In Charge  via
He just had to find some criticism.  In the words of Joe Biden, come on man!
biden tested negative

And made fun of Biden for wearing a mask.
He'll hand the presidency over to Pence due to Covid related health concerns so that Pence can pardon him off all federal crimes just prior to Biden becoming president.
Makes sense, he can work out of the presidential office there while he takes it easy for a few days - although I'm sure his idea of taking it easy is busier than Biden hiding in his basement üòÖ
Biden is suspending all negative ads.  Big mistake.
Biden should be punished FOR TAKING Covid seriously, AND, cause Trump tested positive for something he claims doesn‚Äôt exist?  RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Would Trump do the same for Biden?
I think it‚Äôs fine if the Biden camp wants to be somber but they can‚Äôt act like he‚Äôd do the same for them.
That‚Äôs obvious, Biden in his infinite wisdom just thought of it!
Joe Biden doesn't need the likes of Fox News to tell him what is right to do. He has good instincts because he is a good person.
Biden pulls all negative ads about Trump but U  know Trump wouldn‚Äôt do the same for Biden.  I‚Äôm not an uncaring person but with all Trump has done 2 our country, the unnecessary deaths due to his lies about Covid.  He‚Äôs trying to end our democracy. All‚Äôs fair in love &amp; war.
#BidenHarris2020  Biden had a great speech today.
Look at that. #biden campaign just stop all negative advertising.  Class...nothing but class... #TrumpHasCovid  #FLOTUS  #BidenHarris2020  #BidensUnitingUS
Donald Trump to be hospitalized following Covid diagnosis, White House says ‚Äì live | Donald Trump | The Guardian
Biden And Trump Campaigns Pursue Different Strategies In AZ | KJZZ
I don‚Äôt think Pence can run. He can be acting President thru the 25th amendment. Biden would be President in Jan which will be end of Trump‚Äôs term.
Fair, but continuing to shit on trump while he‚Äôs sick will only dissuade Border votes from choosing Biden.
I think it‚Äôs respectably classy for Biden to let up a little bit, but they need to be careful to not lose ground for no reason
has anybody expressed concerns about Biden having been breathing the air so close to Trump when he was yelling and hollering at the debate?
Biden launches ads touting his faith after cardinal says he's 'not a Catholic in good standing'  #FoxNews #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
(...I do wish him well...for reals...)  What would FoxNews do...if this were Biden?
Imagine what tRump would be saying if this was Biden.
This is such a silly question to pose? Why should Biden halt his campaigning just because Trump got Covid-19?  You reap what you sow.
Absolutely not. Biden has been smart and following guidelines while Trump has been reckless and making it worse. Also, if Rs can push Judah‚Äôs appointment while Trump is sick, Biden can keep campaigning.
Live updates: Trump to head to Walter Reed after positive coronavirus test - The Washington Post
The problem is that Biden can say anything because MSM never fact checks him
I am begging all legislators and other leaders--please take this opportunity to RECANT your lies about #COVID19, admit you were wrong, and save the lives of your constituency.
State of the Union 2022: Kamala Harris: *declares unlawful assembly and unloads 8 clips into the audience for clapping* Biden, like Porky the Pig: That's all folks!
Live updates: Trump expected to head to Walter Reed hospital after positive test; Biden tests negative for coronav‚Ä¶
üëç so after saying Biden was hiding in his basement, Trump will be hiding in his bunker.
The world would breathe a sigh of relief. Then Biden would be elected and normalcy will return.
Biden is going to win. He was going to win before this. He'll win after this.
The white supremacy narrative, Biden's misunderstanding of the constitution &amp; a discussion on socialized medicine
So if Biden wins is there a way to sterilize the White House?
Yes especially since  is airing a Biden speech.
BIDEN: "We're going to bring Jack brack jobs"
Biden scores points with this one.
No. He made his bed so now he has to sleep in it.  He chooses not to wear a mask, participate in rallies, and making fun of Biden for wearing masks &amp; social distancing.  If I go party all night knowing I start a new job the next day,  should they hold my job?
It's important to keep in mind that most of what Trump says is projection. When he says Biden will be a puppet to the extreme left, what he really means is "republicans are going to put sunglasses on my bloated, orange corpse."
Lol - Biden Interrupted Trump first... 34 minutes into the debate. Trump is a street fighter... and he‚Äôs challenging the ‚ÄúHolier than thou‚Äù mentality of lifetime politicians. That‚Äôs why many do not like his presence - his foot is not in his mouth it‚Äôs in their arse.
He would demand that Biden drop out of the race.
Donald trump is the president until Biden is inaugurated
And all this prior to COVID    Since then he's brokered deals between three Arab countries and Israel. Something Joe Biden's administration insisted was IMPOSSIBLE.
excited for  SNL as Biden. don't forget he basically played him on In Living Color decades ago.  And when will  get to host!?? In fact,  Bring in the cast of In Living color to host. Carrey, Grier, Wayans's's, Davidson, Fox
Trump's campaign would double up on the negative ads, plus they'd capitalize on Biden's sickness. Wait, I thought this was "just like the flu"? Why all the worry, Republicans?
Agree with those saying this is a bad tweet. Biden didn't pull out his mask at the debate. If anything, it was Trump who was signaling his (false) virtue by pulling out his mask--a mask he doesn't wear in public.
pence if something happens to pence then pelosi but if biden also has it and they both go down what the hell would happen
"This is what will happen in Biden's America!"  (Footage taken in Trump's America.)
‚Äúfuel to the fire‚Äù is another one of those vague metaphors that means nothing in this political context. y‚Äôall were terrified they would call bernie a communist during the campaign. now they‚Äôre calling biden a communist anyway. because they‚Äôre liars and you‚Äôre bad at politics.
sorry but wouldn't you guys agree that if you claim to be neutral in Trump vs Biden , you either wouldn't care or you wouldn't support one over the other ? like if you want one over the other , then that's who you support ? like cmon guys this is 6th grade vocabulary
You know why I vote for and believe in Trump? Bc if Trump continues to succeed then other businessmen will be emboldened to run for POTUS. That he will end the endless cycle of career politicians lining their bank accounts with Backdoor deals and yes I‚Äôm looking at u, Biden
Joe Biden is older, and weaker.
And you think Biden isn‚Äôt ü§£Biden has spent his entire career ‚Äúenriching‚Äù himself and his family, and dam right I want to know why a Russian oligarch paid hunters company 3.6million, it‚Äôs important, Hunter is a security risk to US and Biden is to bc of him
Biden‚Äôs outreach has been to lock us up, call us predators, tell us if we don‚Äôt vote for him ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù. What are you saying?
My feelings are Joe may be sincere, but it‚Äôs also a way of them to say ‚ÄúSee what happens when you don‚Äôt wear a mask!‚Äù  Bingo:  Joe Biden I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.
I‚Äôm looking for the danger? How has killed anymore blacks than the previous 4-5 administrations? What are we scared of exactly? I did not say I support Trump. I‚Äôm pushing back on the narrative that Biden is better. Frankly, Trumps record is better for black people than Biden‚Äôs üëÄ
"Democrats" is a blanket statement.  Biden made a very solid message hoping Trump had a recovery.  Don't confuse "Democrats" with everybody registered to that party affiliation
Inauguration day: President Pelosi until Biden wins, watch.
Trump he hired excellent accountant. Now let see Obumer taxes, he came with less than 1 mln and left with 40mln. Let's see Biden's taxes, I wonder if he paid taxes for the bribes he got from Russian billionaire for human trafficking.
Bull--Biden took appropriate precautions, trump didn't so his bad!
Strawman my ass. People are acting like Biden/Harris are gonna be the cure to all of our ills. I‚Äôm stating they are objectively just as much a cause of them too. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúHere take this pill. It will kill you in 4 days instead of 3‚Äù. How about I don‚Äôt take any ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This issue is acting like Biden is somehow a better choice for black people over Trump. They are both clowns. But at least Trump has tried to reach out to blacks. Kamala is even worse. So voting 3rd party is a much preferable option than choosing any the mainstream party choices
So a lot of politicians like Biden are gonna be like "Thoughts and prayers are with them for a swift recovery" yada yada because yeah, if you're gonna be in charge of a whole country you have to show you won't pull a Trump and let the people on the other side die just becuz.
Outside force, Biden couldn't stop him.
Thank God you &amp; Doctor Biden are alright. I hope your team is safe as well. #WENEEDYOUüá∫üá∏
Does anyone think if the situation was reverse trump would stop?He would make fun of Biden for wearing a mask and still getting sick.
Instant Karma: Trump bashing Biden for wearing a mask wherever he goes and gets coronavirus the very next day. Love it. ü§£ #Debates2020
"His campaign is not happy."  That's hilarious.  It's been the case for at least several weeks.  Biden knows who his base is: antifa.
one of my friends that has never registered to vote and he is 28 just texted me and said he will be registering this year to vote for Joe Biden after the debateü•∫ü•∫ I‚Äôm such a proud friend rn
Umm this ain‚Äôt happening no more. I don‚Äôt know what y‚Äôall are talking about Biden ain‚Äôt taking that risk for muthafucking what ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah they don‚Äôt tell you which is great shows they are the weakest of the weak . They haven‚Äôt been anywhere. Just watch Biden will catch it real soon
Say what?  Challenge for Biden hmmmmm. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll take that challenge and win because we know who wears the clown shoes.
Joe Biden tests negative for coronavirus
Yeah I can‚Äôt even imagine what the comments would be from the right if it was Biden who had come down with covid.  They would be even more relentless just like they are with everything else.  Don‚Äôt play the victim!
That's what the Right insinuated Biden would do. It was laughable.   Trump faking Covid would be politically damning. It would have been the end of the campaign for Biden.   That being said, Lorraine is promoting Qanon and it deserves to be called out.
Jim Carrey as Joe Biden I cant fucking wait.
There's no reason to believe that Walter Reed staff are not compromised as well. I don't believe that there's anyone at all that's going to be solidly reliable about this. Maybe we'll know someday if Biden is elected and there's a clean sweeping out of cult members.
I love Joe Biden
Who is Alex Jones ? In case you missed it I listen to music all day not the media.  Bottom line Joe Biden is an incompetent ‚Äúpublic servant‚Äù whose only accomplishment has been to make himself and the people around him rich, trump has driven the economy and employment to records
So Biden AND Chris Wallace had the kobiashimaru , there was NO WAY they could succeed with the king of crap.  Now miraculously he has COVID! Just in time to distract from what he said in debate and time to gain sympathy donations - solicitation online now.  Sick #TrumpFakesCovid
Why would he want to get out of the debate ? Biden is a tool and he chewed him up and spit him out . What a bunch of idiots you know
You‚Äôre not wrong. Look at all the ‚Äúoff the cuff‚Äù racist remarks Biden has made; not just over the years, but most recently, too.
I'm sure you'll be 'fine' in a few day and you'll go about biz as usual proving a distraction to America for your husband's iditotic debate, white supremacy advocation and a time out for news on Joe Biden.  Did I miss anything?
Stay healthy Joe Biden XOXO
You seem to pay close attention to what happens with the NPP. So I figured i'd let you know
Low key Trump and Biden both getting Rona really would‚Äôve been a best case scenario for America
oh man, I bet Trump would feel really stupid right now for making fun of how much Biden wears a mask during the debate if he wasn‚Äôt a soulless narcissist who is incapable of any humility or self reflection... #TrumpHasCovid
Speedy recovery.  However, I don't like Presidents who got sick.  Or let's see your past tweets where you were sick in the head and telling Pres.Obama hug ebola patients.  Or not advising Biden hicks had tested positive. That they learned via the news. That's deplorable.
Donny j. Trump Would not wish VP Biden to get well if he had Covid. Trump could care less about the truth. He does not even believe in his own administration or CDC. Is this fake news from the Trumps. Vote nov 3rd.
Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice for a candidate but now he‚Äôs the only option.
Very nice of VP Biden. Willing to bet if it was reversed Donny j would not say a thing.
This coming from the people that said Biden was gunna ‚Äúget COVID‚Äù so he didn‚Äôt have to debate, now all of a sudden it‚Äôs unthinkable to joke about. Y‚Äôall are the biggest babies I‚Äôve ever met
like when i'm scrolling through my tl i see more posts attacking biden than i do posts attacking trump. in general, i don't really see a lot of criticism of the gop, but plenty of criticism of dems. maybe my tl is just fucked up though
Trump has tested positive for COVID. Biden has tested negative for COVID.  Let's hear it for the scientific method!
Good. Keep going. Trump wouldn't slow down and he'd be out there mocking Biden like he's been doing all this time anyways.
-Refused to encourage mask wearing by insulting people for wearing them, most notably earlier this week when he mocked Biden for his mask wearing at the debate. -Has been in several arguments against his own task force members AND the CDC. He thinks he knows more than doctors.
I know I've been contributing to Biden and to the opponents of nasty Republicans wherever I can find them. That's what happens when your lot is so completely despicable.
I‚Äôm sorry but Biden isn‚Äôt going to end racism and climate change and sexism and police brutality. Trump can‚Äôt either. Stop thinking that the president will save us. They‚Äôre puppets. How many elections do we have to go through before we realize our system is too archaic?
Lmao at the people with brain worms wondering if Biden should suspend his campaign while Trump is sick and can't campaign. Y'all realize that Trump campaigned through the entire democratic primary when nobody could campaign on our side yet because nobody had won, right?
The only way it goes down significantly is if Biden contracts COVID, as it is generally presumed he'll be elected next month and Trump's time is over anyway
especially making fun of Biden for always wearing one... is it a hoax now?
Trump: *Makes fun of Biden for trying to stay say safe by warring a mask and social distancing *  Trump: *Gets Covid-19*
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tests negative for COVID-19
Biden tests negative for COVID-19
Biden tests negative for COVID-19.
Biden tests negative, we know who‚Äôs alpha now
My prayers ain‚Äôt with that nigga yo ass trippin , go Biden
I am betting way too close to the election. I‚Äôm basically hoping that Biden doesn‚Äôt get covid
Chris Wallace: The Trump family was not wearing masks at the debate and they actively waived off aids who tried to give them masks.  Fox News Response:  Don't you think it would be hypocritical if Biden went door to door campaigning today?
With trump having covid, don‚Äôt let the media only focus on trump. This is the time where we bring awareness to his campaign, what he HAS NOT done &amp; why Biden is better for America. He used the word ‚Äútogether‚Äù in his tweet. Even though in 4 years he created an even deeper divide.
Awesome, speedy recovery, now go give Biden a big kiss for me!  LOL!
what dose the RNC do for a Presidential replacement for president should the Trumpster become unable to run for office. Maybe the race comes down to choice between Biden and West; that is a sobering thought
The President and First Lady will get through it and recover well.   Trump can now say something Biden and Harris can‚Äôt; ‚ÄúI had COVID19.‚Äù
Wow so Biden says he attended a delaware university and gets attacked because he didn't use the right order or words. The scotus nomination is touted as a rhodes scholar because they went to a place with a similar name? The hypocrisy is dripping.
200k+ dead Americans(and counting) plus another economic recession bc of your inability to protect and serve &amp; the audacity to still believe that this WORLDWIDE pandemic is a political hoax... you even mocked Biden for advocating to wear masks. If anyone deserves it, its you.. üò§
I'm waiting to see what Biden puts out. He has empathy so will see
For all those Democrats cheering - Biden can't hide from the crowds for ever, let alone run a country.
He was right . He didn‚Äôt get it at an event . Biden can go screw himself
Biden üò∑ should march on since the Trump virus is a hoax
Sadly in reality he‚Äôs been waitin for these debates because Biden won‚Äôt be able to keep up with him
It will be ok . Keep up the fear mongering so we don‚Äôt have to have Biden here . I love it .
Ok !! So . This is nothing and you know it . Most of the tests are the ones from before . Nobody is dying in the streets . Arizona has this . Keep reporting the fear , maybe Biden won‚Äôt come .
‚Äúvote for biden or DIE‚Äù *desperately, passionately kisses trump to his ouchies better*
Joe Biden, Kamala Harris to make campaign appearance in Arizona
Trump campaign calls out second debate moderator who interned for Biden, worked for Ted Kennedy  #FoxNews #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
it‚Äôs performative decency.  you absolutely fucking cannot simultantaneously believe trump is running concentration camps, destroying democracy, and going to create a fourth reich if biden doesn‚Äôt win the election, but also want to kiss it and make it better when he gets hurt.
That's so true. Biden didn't say it. But I'm sure he thought of it.
Don't know, when pressed Chris Wallace nor Biden couldn't even name a ' white supremist ' group, any decent moderator would have been more specific with the question.
False. Trump is pro life. Biden isnt.
He is lying! He is trying to control the media so you and Biden can not get your message out before the election! He will claim the virus is no more than the flu right before voting....
It will make him stronger, even more resolve to beat Harris... I mean Biden üòè
But Biden is what??? For wearing what???? HAHAHAHA
Let's all donate to Joe Biden campaign and democrat senators.
And this is why I wanted any debate to be virtual. Trump spewed and spit all over Biden.
Does it matter what Biden says? No. Look man, Trump is the president and had knowledge of everything. A true leader would have made the call before he did...like oh I don‚Äôt know...when he found out about it? And he didn‚Äôt even ban travel. He let 40k fucking repatriate.
If both Trump and Biden were infected with Covid, who do you think would be most likely to survive?
Trump knew about Hicks as he was trying to demean Biden about wearing a mask.  #TrumpVirus #SuperspreaderEvent
How is wishing someone death somehow a party-specific position?  It‚Äôs just the tasteless opinion of Americans whom see the POTUS with morbid irony. Biden isn‚Äôt responsible.  Individuals are.
. just crushed CNN!  Powerfully laid out the facts &amp; refused to play CNN‚Äôs games  Biden‚Äôs track record on race is disgusting  President  has a record fighting for &amp; helping all Americans regardless of race  This may be the best exchange on CNN of 2020
We don‚Äôt have to be gaining jobs, we can still be going losing them....made 0 sense.  But no trump has turned it around. Again...nothing. I understood the sentence about Biden...but I‚Äôm not voting for him either so contextually, it holds no weight.
God bless Biden, such a humble man! We need this man in the White House!!
1st the loudest Trump supports I know are POC. There is a Trump clothing stand outside my neighborhood ran by POC. 2nd I heard 3rd party get blamed for Hillary losing, so people have had at least 4 years to warm up to 3rd party. If someone doesn‚Äôt like Biden don‚Äôt vote for him.
Biden's social media peeps took the high road so some of you wouldn't have to.  That seems nice.
Biden: Damn, rough blow Donny. T&amp;P.
it‚Äôs almost as if we‚Äôve been saying this since 2016!!!ü§°are the american people REALLY letting these stupid bastards get away with things like this? Obama, Biden, and Killary for prison.
He has it. He lied and called the virus a hoax. He makes fun of Biden for wearing a mask, and for holding small campaign events. He tells reporters to take off their masks. He still holds large rallies where mask-wearing is not required. He says it affects virtually no one. 1/
Donald Trump's Family Ignored Mandatory Mask Rule at Presidential Debate With Joe Biden
I think Biden should act like Trump would act.
During the debate, it was sure amusing to Trump to make fun of Joe Biden and the size of the mask that he wears and that he doesn't need to wear it. Karma!
It could still have spread through contact, to both #Biden and #Pelosi
Total class from our next President of the United States of America üëçGo Joe Biden
If Biden positive, they should be forced to quarantine together with live cameras covering the action.
I can‚Äôt help but remember a point in the debate the other night where you roasted Joe Biden for wearing a mask too much
Imagine not understanding the left forces him to continue doing rallies but two Biden not to debate him in oct 15. HE HAS THE SAME VIRUS IF THEY WERE 8 FEET AWAY NOT WEARING MASKS THAT ARE INFORCED
Well John where‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs condemnation of BLM and Antifa? Saw a montage on OAN where Trump has denounced white supremacy dozens of times.
Trump's Supreme Court gambit could benefit Biden: Reuters/Ipsos poll  REPUBLICANS WILL PAY DEARLY AT THE POLLS IF THEY PROCEED WITH SUPREME COURT PIC DURING ELECTION! WE WILL VOTE AS MANY OUT AS WE CAN TO PROTECT OUR RIGHT! VOTE BLUE, MAKE THEM PAY!
Ask him to denounce his ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù from the past even. Byrd for one. Biden IS the white supremacist in the room!
Remember when you said Biden was wearing his mask ‚Äútoo much‚Äù? Maybe wanna follow his lead now?
You're right.  That is a far worse, uglier message, used by Biden in debate, which is why they'll run with it.  They won't be happy till there's a 2nd civil war.
WAAAAA! John Roberts check back in the hundreds is times prior he denounced white supremacy on every level. What is wrong with you ‚Äòcome on man‚Äô. Let‚Äôs try asking a tough question to Biden:Why was he spewing praise onto Byrd? Or the other times he spoke in favor of segregation?
2 days before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump mocked Biden for wearing a face mask  TRUMP SHOWS HE CAN'T HELP US OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. MASKS SAVES LIVES NOW TRUMP &amp; FAMILY HAS VIRUS. SHAME ON TRUMP. TRUMP KILLS PEOPLE VIA HIS IGNORANCE! DUMP TRUMP!!!!
Good sign. Go Joe Biden!
Biden's lead over Trump holding in battleground Arizona as voters see US on wrong track  VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS TO SAVE JOBS, LIVES, ECONOMY, SOCIAL SECURITY, HEALTHCARE, &amp; MEDICARE. TRUMP IS A LIAR AND CON MAN CRIMINAL. WE MUST VOTE REDS OUT. SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY
Glad he refused to shake Biden's hand.
If #Biden got #COVID19 you cretins would be either A) declaring it a farce to gain sympathy votes or B) dancing in the streets and praying to the bloodthirsty ‚ÄòGod‚Äô you worship that he dies an agonizing painful death. Spare us your indignation and outrage. üôÑ
I hope they didn't give to Joe Biden who has followed scientific advice.
Sen. Sinema, and before that Sec. Clinton. I'm more excited this year to vote for Sen. Harris than VP Biden this year.
anyone have word on biden getting tested

Fuuuuuck. Now I feel bad cause that bastard wouldn't wear a mask and even mocked it (Biden for wearing one) during the debate.   Seriously, this fucker gets worse and worse.
Biden interrupted first.
What if Trump ‚Äútested‚Äù positive to avoid the debates with Biden? Although they both suck he took the L in my opinion.
And his maskless groupies sat near Dr. Biden. Pray for Joe and Jill!
How far was Biden standing from Trump at the debate
S&amp;P futures now rebounding from the news. The market might get excited over Biden
Trump was already sweaty, mom‚Äôs spaghetti. I only wish Biden had a mask and shield on.
Will Joe Biden publicly denounce pedophilia?
I had respect for your father and also for you until you aligned yourself with Biden‚Äôs socialist handlers üò°
Or racism.. Remember that KKK guys funeral... Oh yeah.. Fellow senator of Biden..
#TrumpHasCovid so what does Biden say? If I were him, I would say, "The President now has Covid. He finally is an example to the nation of why we need to wear a mask and socially distance." And then just move to other things and policy. Don't talk about it.
GOD I PRAY YOU WILL PROTECT JOE BIDEN AT ALL COSTS!
And you can disagree with Biden's policies, and still respect him, but we cannot respect an irresponsible manbaby who thinks there are good people on both sides of a white supremacist rally who is a bully and a cheat. One is a decent human being. The other is an indecent monster.
Trump will be calling every Fox show and tweeting all day. He‚Äôll show up at next debate in exactly 14 days looking great. Biden is going to look weak and old.
Noone on you half has courage to face things personally. And when they do they blame things that I guarantee biden has this virus
Now he and how wife gave covid. Compare that to why the left is telling biden to not devate
He also closed our boarders, which Biden wouldn't have done. Who are you voting for in the next election???
I hear this might help people not get sick ...
Trump closing our boarders most definitely helped. Which Biden called xenophobic, therefore he wouldn't have done it for a while. Trump saved many lives with that.
Mind ya.....Trump about 48 hours removed from making comments about Biden‚Äôs kids, now look at em
TRUMP GOT RONA JUST TO AVOID DEBATE WITH BIDEN! Please see past the lies
Biden would have waited nearly two months before closing our boarders. Trump saved many lives with that.
So Biden has no symptoms but gave covid-19 to trump while trump was known to be around other covid-19 positive patient. Did I understand the conjecture right
Y‚Äôall Biden supporters just as ignorant as the Trump supporters
remember when he was making fun of joe biden for wearing a mask too often
Exactly why I am voting for Biden.
if joe biden gets covid too can we all please just vote for Kanye üò§
Watch "Donald Trump mocks the way Biden wears his mask" on YouTube
imagine making fun of Biden for wearing a mask and then GETTING COVID... AS THE PRESIDENT
He can't stand to lose. He can't beat Biden in a debate. Pence will pardon him for all present and future federal crimes. Best part for hi., he can blame the virus and other people who have the virus.
Pray Biden is safe
Good chance Trump &amp; Melania announcing testing positive for Corona virus is a Hoax! A diversion tactic!  He‚Äôd do anything to not have to debate Biden again!
Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask and being extra cautious was one of the most infuriating things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Would dt do that if Biden tested positive for Covid-19?  No, not a chance, he would use it to his advantage. Joe wouldn‚Äôt do that, he is an ethical and compassionate person unlike dt, Joe will announce his heartfelt best wishes for a speedy recovery for both of them + HH
My best friend is 45. She registered to vote this year. Her 22 year old daughter registered to vote this year. She just helped her 45 year husband register to vote. He was solidly Trump earlier this year and now all 3 are voting Biden.
Biden needs to be tested though. He was 15 feet away Trump without masks for 90 minutes at the debate. That is my one and only concern. If Trump gets sick, so be it. He put himself in harm's way repeatedly without care for himself or others.
This is the reason I did not want Biden to debate Trump. Biden is careful and Trump is reckless. I hope The Bidens did not get too much exposure!
He was talkin all that shit about how Biden wears a mask. I guess he spoke too soonü§≠ü§ßüò∑ü§£
This was like watching a horror movie. Asking myself, ‚ÄúWhy do keep watching?‚Äù But not being able to move from the edge of my seat. I hate that Joe Biden had to respond in an undiplomatic way, but how else do we handle a two year old bully. Shut off his mike.
Question:  How can any Black American really believe Biden is on their side?  Answer:   They have not educated themselves of the Negative Black facts of Biden's WHOLE LIFE.   Biden supports SEGREGATION.  Hehasin the 70's, the 80's, the 90 and now. #WalkAway
Remember that one time Trump made fun of Biden for wearing a mask? #TrumpHasCovid
I'm praying for Joe Biden who was on stage for 90 minutes with that idiot spewing his lies and probably the virus. And for Dr. Biden sitting in the audience with the tRump groupies not wearing masks.
Dude - what if he gave it to Biden
I bet you feel stupid for making fun of Biden for wearing a mask now dont ya?
If Biden did win (which he wont) he wouldn‚Äôt be sworn into office until January just like every other president
I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU GAVE BIDEN THE VIRUS
*patiently awaits Biden‚Äôs response
Bet you wish you were a big Biden mask now!
Yeah I was thinking that. In the debate they maintained distance but who knows ! FWIW don‚Äôt remember Trump coughing even once in the debate so I hope Biden is safe as far as debate exposure is concerned even though it can spread through aerosols while one speaks !
this mf trump was talkin about biden and his mask lmaoo now look at you
Guarden a Biden!
Y‚Äôall check on Biden please
trump getting covid is what we deserve after having to settle for biden &lt;3
the fact trump made fun of biden two days ago at the debates for wearing a mask is so satisfying rn ü•∞
I hope Biden has been tested. He was around the Big Moron.
trump should ask biden where he got his mask from he‚Äôs gonna need it
Two days ago he was steps from Joe Biden for 90+ minutes. This is horrible.
You forgot Biden
i‚Äôm convinced that if biden gets covid it‚Äôs because trump wouldn‚Äôt shut his damn mouth at the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù
pretty high tbh because they got tested before the event Trump and Biden both had masks on so i‚Äôm willing to bet they got it during the event so yea Biden needs to get tested asap
Before Tuesday. I would have bet $1,000,000 it would have been Biden that ‚Äúcaught‚Äù it just so he could avoid the debates.
Also PROTECT JOE BIDEN. that means he was contagious at the debate üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨ #Debates2020
Our country does not need this. I hope he gets better quickly so the election goes through as scheduled. And then I hope Biden wins.
But the Right said Biden would fake a positive test to get out of the debates.  The irony makes you wonder üßê
The way trump was literally JUST making fun of Biden for wearing a mask everywhere and now has covid........ what an idiot ü§£
I am worried for Biden. Hopefully he is okay.
Wishing him a speedy recovery from Covid-19 or "the hoax" as he calls it. That mask doesn't look so dumb on Biden now does it!
You know how bernidiots love to talk shit about "establishment Dems"?  Guess who would choose the backup nominee if the worst case scenario happened and Biden wasn't able to run.  Hint: It would NOT be members of the DSA or Green Party.
Several things on my mind.  He‚Äôs ‚Äútoo sick &amp; resigns‚Äù, Pence takes over as write in &amp; eventually pardons trump.  Trump actually sick a&amp; govt is at a standstill even through Biden wins.  Trump wants sympathy votes among his debacle at debate along w/Melania showing her ass today.
Chris Wallace blames Trump for chaotic debate: He 'bears the primary responsibility'
I just don‚Äôt want Trump to be replaced by *anyone against Biden so I am hoping that he stays healthy.
Imagine Biden and Trump both get COVID and die within the next 30 days
In the mean time, here are my questions:  1) Will he die? 2) Is Mike Pence the President now? (via 25th Amend.) 3) Is Joe Biden doing okay?
Your such a mega colossal fuckboi thankfully biden and his wife do follow the protocols although they should be tested just in case.
Question for my constitutional colleauges. Supposing both Trump and Biden are positive, and either severely incapacitated, or, heaven forbid, die from covid: what‚Äôs the proceedure? Does it depend if it happens before or after the election?
the media needs to stop referring to Joe Biden as Vice President. The Vice President of the United States, right now, is Mike Pence. Joe Biden‚Äôs stint is over.

isnt this the same man who was teasing joe biden for always wearing a face mask
I hope he didn't give to Biden. He screamed at him for 90 mins.
Do you guys need a laugh. Watch till the end  #happyplace #stephencolbert   Watch "GOP Worries They Backed The Wrong Horse As Biden's Lead Grows Following "Embarrassing" Debate" on YouTube
Uhhhhhhh...... has Biden been tested???? They just shared a stage!
What‚Äôs crazy to think is that if Biden and Trump shook hands, we would essentially have two candidates with Rona at the same time, that‚Äôs crazy
HOAX INFECTION! You just want 14 days to go golfing. And you are afraid to debate Biden again.
No way!!! And the SOB made fun of Biden for wearing a mask.
ads claim he will end the division in this Country. If he continually defends it he obviously wishes a return to the violence of Obama/Biden years or he would be calling George Soros and tell him to pull the plug on the #BidenRiots. You have your own denouncing to do.
First off, the governors don‚Äôt work for the president, secondly, it‚Äôs a long shot that Biden has a job in politics anytime soon.
I don't ever talk politics on social media, but I feel like I need to right now. I just saw an add on YouTube from Biden begging voters to vote from home and mail in their ballots...PLEASE DON'T! It's just a way to rig the election. Vote in person, or don't vote at all. Think!!!
Gen Xers have the absolutely stupidest ideas for things Biden could do in the next debate to insult Trump lmao
My comment - I am voting for Biden and Harris on October 8 in person in the state of Arizona .., we don‚Äôt need weirdos like the trump clan in our government anymore !
I sincerely believe that Biden and Harris will rid us of the trump virus
Pffftttt... hahaha   ... currently redirecting to Joe Biden for President.   Some MAD LADS out there.
America is strong under Trump.  America will be wimpy under Biden.
Who had "CNN will bring up an old video from 2018 1 month before the election when Biden's ratings are down" on their bingo card?
When Wallace asked Trump to denounce white supremacy, &amp; Trump kept asking to name one, Biden said ‚ÄúProud Boys‚Äù 3 times &amp; Trump heard him say that so Trump said Proud Boys. Look at the tape and watch Biden laughing after Trump said proud boys.
I don‚Äôt care about trump ,I want Biden and Jill to be ok.

I hope he didn't give to Biden. Trump screamed at him nonstop for 90 min.
1,000% True VP BidenGuy acts like the pink Eveready bunny or a Timex watch. Kinda incredible compared to no-show, basement dwelling Biden. Sharp contrast!
When Biden is elected do I personally have to burn my American flag or do I have to call a bureaucrat to come do it for me?
I'll let the President research Biden and hold us to researching the battle in the streets.
Of course not. Joe Biden has more class and compassion in his little finger than Trump has in his big, fat body.
I think your point is mute. If Biden wins, Willies knee pad trollop win ascend the Presidency.
Trump and Biden don‚Äôt really get along
This f****** moron Joe Biden he's talking about masks when they were allowing all these rioters and protesters to run around the streets without mask and then he worries about the great president not wearing a mask go figure typical Nazi.
I've read Biden's; haven't seen anything from Harris. Guess some folks are still into knee-jerk reactions instead of waiting a bit to see what actually happens.
I would rather have a president that has China virus which is 99.9% curable then a president with dementia and is a Nazi who only cares about lining his own Pockets like Joe Biden and Joe also wants to destroy America for China.
Good. Because those idiot Trump supporters refuse to wear a mask.    is one of the worst, and she's supposed to be a Nurse. Let Biden come!!!
When are you hacks going to ask Joe Biden to denounce white supremacy?  Who gave the eulogy to the grand cyclops Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan ?  Who wrote and passed Jim Crow laws? Who fought for segregation so his kids didn‚Äôt have to go to a jungle?  Oh yea that was Joe Biden

Mr President U never cared about the people. U were evil as evil as can be &amp; made fun of Biden 4 wearing his mask all the way up to his eyeballs.. remember during the debate? Now look at u &amp; your wife. Over 219,000 deaths. RECKLESS &amp; IRRESPONSIBLE and you didn't give a s*ü§¨t!!

It's Thursday and Biden still doesn't accept the reality of ANTIFA nor does he condemn the mayhem of BLM except in the most general of terms.
If you want respect, you need to show respect. As a Catholic, I am sure Biden has heard that you can only reap what you sow. I guess he figures he can pray for crop failure and be blessed by God. Doesn't work like 'magic', Joe! God knows your heart.
Like John King says, Hunter Biden is a swamp creature, but at least now, he can afford all that sweet expensive blow that his military salary couldn't cover.
RSBNetwork look at it showing Biden wearing a wire
Maybe Biden needs to go back &amp; listen to himself. He was hardly 'Presidential' in what he said &amp; how he said it. I'm not sure he knows what truth is or he has a worse memory than Trump.
What is up Joe Biden‚Äôs sleeve? I don‚Äôt care what the media says. I see what my eyes can see!
If Joe Biden were to bow his head in prayer, besides not being sincere, he would probably rip the sutures from his last face lift.
Biden did not do one bit better looking 'Presidential'.
What I learned from last night's debate is that Biden insists on lying no matter how many times or how many sources have debunked what he keeps saying. Conversely, he refuses to accept as valid any criticism of his son's behavior.
Even with the help of Chris Wallace, Biden could not win the debate, what a 47 year disgrace to America
With Chris Wallace allowing Joe to blatantly lie, by not questioning or calling Biden out one can hardly blame Donald for speaking out, Chris Wallace should be ashamed by his bias and weak attempt  at moderating
Obama can control Biden. This will be Obama‚Äôs and Hillary‚Äôs second shadow presidency. Obama committed treason!
And as far as the debate they're saying the biggest moment was Trump's taxes. The biggest moment should have been asking Joe Biden why he accepted millions and millions of dollars from China and pocketed it for himself.
Before we didn't know what a Trump presidency is like until this election cycle. So the dems know what to expect in the coming 4 years. So, its tou either hate Trump enough to vote for Biden or hate the establishment enough to vote for Trump. It depends on who you hate more.
No doubt Hunter Biden will be WONDERFUL as the United States Advisor and stand in for the President.  In fact, it will be a Biden dynasty with Hinter as the next POTUS, then his kids will carry on.   Are you looking forward to that? No? No worries.  It's only Trump who does it
Are you saying all your issues with Hunter Biden will disappear the moment he gets his own office in the WH? Because then he'll be an official  Advisor just like Jared and Ivanka
Well, how bour this...  Joe Biden can just install Hunter Biden in the WH, let him handle middle east peace, overrule his security clearance denial, and sit on Twitter all day.   That way, ya'all will have nothing more to complain about!!  It'll be JUST LIKE JAVANKA
There will freaking be no dragging Biden's CHILDREN into this election.  Quit your fake outrage and pick another reason to attack Biden.   Once Trump's CHILDREN are out of our WHITE HOUSE, thank GOD our nation can go back to normal.   Real Presidents keep their kids OUT
As I see it, Pres. TRUMP HAD to fight back against all the LIES Biden was spewing, which were exactly like all the LIES the media has been spewing. BIDEN was just repeating all the media lies
You‚Äôre the greatest President ever. Praying for your re election. Biden is a part of the Cabal, he wants to destroy our country
Biden wore a wire in the debate. I thought he had that look üëÄ like he was listening. So  debated Biden, Wallace &amp; the DNC!
I think most people watched the first 30 minutes. Wallace lets Biden respond Trump can‚Äôt. Biden is rude. I think we know how capable Trump is. Biden just spews lies. Wallace fact checks Trump not Biden &amp; is rude to Trump.
Did you not catch when Trump protected your reporting on him at Joe Biden?
Yes ma‚Äôam! It got ugly but....Lying Biden!
He also projected the   article onto Biden tonight. Did nobody else catch that?
Yes but Biden was worse! Clown ü§°?!? üò†
#PresidentialDebate2020 Takeaway.  Joe Biden wouldn't bring himself to say the 3 words Rally the Right chanted that night in Charlottesville.   Donald Trump willingly let the words "Stupid Bastards" and "Military" escape his mouth in the same sentence.
Yup, and Biden thinks ANTIFA is an idea, not an organization. Wow.
If I had a dollar for every time Trump interrupted Biden tonight, I would get more than what Trump paid in taxes üòÇ
Voting. Biden\Harris
Chis Wallace was obviously in the tank for Biden and  had to debate 2 on 1. Disgraceful. I turned to #OAN for truth.
Listening to Biden in this debate is like listening to CNN headlines... so loaded with absolute bullshit.

Well, I cannot compete with you youngsters; I'm older than Trump or Biden.
Wow i really hate to omit this but Biden is winning the debate. I am still Trumper 100%
Wonder if anyone is really surprised HRC was behind this Russian conspiracy hoax from the beginning? It's also pretty obvious Obama &amp; Biden both knew what was going on. Even if they did not initiate or oversee it, neither did they stop the abuse of government resources.
Wallace is fukn this up in Biden‚Äôs favor
Wallace is on Biden‚Äôs side
It‚Äôs not going good for trump, Wallace is on Biden‚Äôs side
It‚Äôs not whether you or I think it‚Äôs right or wrong. These years they are claiming to have his tax information for are under the ‚Äúlegal tax code deductions ‚Äú that the Obama-Biden administration put in place. If it‚Äôs so wrong why didn‚Äôt Joe do something about it, he had 47 years.
That's probably true. However, he is President until Biden gets elected or Trump's 2nd term ends, whichever occurs 1st. His debt; his problem to solve. Ours is to watch what he does; cry foul if he steps over the line &amp; actually does something criminal, not just what we dislike.
Big mistake! I'm pretty sure our MSM has already written the 'news' that Biden won the debate and destroyed Trump.
Joe Biden Sniff and fondle this.
I‚Äôd like someone looking at the podium and ears
Chang ot? Obama &amp; Biden saw the current loopholes put into the taxe code. So now you expect them to rescind their own legislative initiative?
Apparently, Obama's IRS didn't find anything wrong either; they've frequently audited Trump's tax returns. I'm sure had the IRD found something illegal during the 8 years of Obama-Biden they would have acted, but nothing happened!

We all know Trump would be all over how weak Biden is IF he had the COVID. Please note: SCOTUS nomination... there are NO VALUES with
The thing that sucks is that I feel some people who do even more nice things for Trump then Biden is now. But at the same time trump would be gloating right now.
Why is biden acting like goku when he gave cell the senzu bean? Bruh, this is the perfect time to airing these anti ads! He's literally got the thing!
I agree, DO NOT delay the election! Trumpenfuehrer wouldn't, if it was Biden, who was sick! We need to keep going! Biden needs to take this time to double down, on his campaign efforts! We need to fight dirty! Gods know the GOP Cult is!
Biden is a moron, what's he gonna do? ü§™
If we want a President Biden to restore the dignity of the Office of the President, then he needs to start now. Besides, we must get beyond thinking of political opponents as enemies. If we continue that, eventually they will be.
Not a Biden fan at all, but credit should be given were it is do. This is classy üëèüëè
I keep thinking about Trump admonishing Biden: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever use the word ‚Äòsmart‚Äô with me.‚Äù

Sure'd like to know what u'd have done differently. No one knew what Covid was or how to deal w/it but Trump jumped right in to help all who asked for it, issued effective travel ban, followed advice of experts. Contrast: Obama/Biden took 5 months to deal w/ H1N1 and did so badly
Biden as President?  OMG the U.S. is ruined - a corrupt, weirdo who makes my spine crawl.  NO!
Very much in line with Biden‚Äôs character. He‚Äôs not the kind to kick a man when he‚Äôs down. Could you imagine if the roles were reversed and Biden had covid? Trump would be capitalizing on it to the max!

WHAT? Biden spent debate snickering/laughing his s-eating grin laugh to mock Trump; he name-called: liar, racist, clown and other.He was the 1st to interrupt - on the 1st question! Biden set the nasty tone. Trump there to debate on issues but Biden cannot so he went to his TELL.
Wallace is a registered Democrat who fronted for Biden. It was obvious in how he covered for him and in the questions he did ask and those he did not. He never pressed Biden on anything but was rude &amp; interrupted Trump at least 35 times. Wallace is scum and an embarrassing shame.
The 2nd moderator needs to be replaced immediately and all of RNC should be up in arms. Wallace was an obnoxious disgrace to journalism not trying to cover himself by blaming TRUMP!!!  This guy, a Biden friend, should never be a moderator. We MUST FIGHT THIS. Tell us how....
The  crowd on FB is still making fun of Biden for being safe and wearing a mask...
Yet I‚Äôm STILL seeing people ripping on Biden for being safe and wearing masks. Are you serious?? This country is in big trouble.
This is ALL bull, Chris. U lost control of debate in the 1st question; it was Biden who started interrupting, Joe who name-called and neighed his s-eating laugh to mock Trump.Your q's were ALL biased &amp; worded precisely to show ur prejudices. It was unfair &amp; a setup &amp; all on you.
Thank the Lord. Continued good health and safety to you and Mrs. Biden, Joe.
Since so many are asking, of course Biden shouldn't suspend his campaign. Trump wouldn't.
The president did not disclose the information he had! How was Biden suppose to know the extent of the virus? He‚Äôs not in office. Trump sent 18 tons of medical supplies to China in Feb!  I would think he would replenish the stock pile. I could go on but you clearly don‚Äôt see It.
only had Biden +2, I mean I agree its not going to be 11 points, but Ernst is in trouble
I worship God and support trump. There are more Christian Trump supporters then biden supporters since the left wants to get rid of God.
He would love to stomp all over biden again in the next debate like he did on the last one. Only thing that saved Biden was Wallace.
The worst case scenario would be that COVID doesn‚Äôt materially impact  but he gave it to  it kills Biden, and nobody votes for  because of her gender and race. That outcome would fill me with despair. #WhiteHouseOutbreak #AmericaOrTrump
Honestly Biden should get tested too because he was in the same area as trump and he didn‚Äôt have a mask on (but This was probably due to debate) hope Biden is ok and his wife.. Virus sucks either way
Evan Biden has deals with corporations and foreign businesses and leaders. He won‚Äôt talk about but we know is happening. This world we lived in is evil and corrupted and the hard working Americans have to deal with it while the rich sit back and relax. God is being removed from..
I hope Joe Biden and Chris Wallace are fine after the 90min barrage.
Bet his guys are saying, our boy is doing this because of politics, standby if biden wind let's start a war.... Oops already videos of that üòÇ
That was a ridiculous question and I was shocked John would stoop to the level of CNN reporters. How many times does he have to say he denounces them. Biden is the one with a strong KKK tie.
Ain‚Äôt u the bitch who made fun of biden for always wearing a mask
What way would that be Magic?, I hope you don‚Äôt mean the idiocy which is Biden-Harris ticket, I hope you‚Äôre not yet another elite misled that has drunk the radical cocktail which is the Democratic Party
No  joe Biden was right for telling trump to shut up trump wasn‚Äôt following the rules and was relentless with his interruptions
And what research would that be? You probably didn‚Äôt even know who Biden was before he became a VP under Obama.. but now you‚Äôre an expert and anti joe?
I'm so glad that idiot didn't get close to Joe Biden at the debate
Did he call Biden a clown, fool, racist or tell him to shut up?
If Biden can handle Cornpop, Trump shouldn't be a problem.
Can you tell me the racist things Trump said/did as opposed to Biden's very long and deep dive into racism? I can list Biden's but the long list won't fit here.
And I understand You. All of Us are Not to Blame. Blame Government and Huge Corporations that Run our Cities and Towns.... People didnt do it. Some rednecks and BLM and rioters did, but not the People Standing Up for the Rights of Others. Biden Bad, Trump Worse...You are amazing!
And will throw your votes at these morons because Kamilla is a black woman and biden isn't Trump.  Same goes for Trumpsters that will vote for him because he isnt biden.  Everyone needs to pull their heads out of their collective asses and start looking at facts on both sides.
You realize, of course, that Biden lies about everything. His tell when he can't respond: laugh and snicker his s-eating laugh and name-call.  He's best at both and good at little else.
You realize, of course, that Biden lies about everything. His TELL when he can't answer or is cornered: snicker that s-eating laugh of his and name call instead of respond.
I'm gonna say some shit you dont like, but I hope you listen.  Biden is a fucking idiot, Trump isnt wrong about him.  That's just facts.  I bet you support BLM right? (Yes I am assuming) Did you know Bidens 94 crime bill directly influenced police behavior to target POCs?
Biden had no specifics for his "plan," goes to his TELL: name calling(liar, clown, etc.) &amp; snickering his lunatic laugh when caught at something he said or couldn‚Äôt expand on.  Trump was debating the MSM , the establishment and Biden. That was unfortunate.
Fortunately there are many more who see the total disaster Biden is, even w/his cheating. Note: the Biden lucid during debate and the mumbling, stumbling, forgetting Biden the next day on his whistle stop train tour! Tell you Dad to rethink this. He was right the first time.
Did you go into the debate knowing how partisan you were going to be?  No matter. You lost control from the 1st question and got worse from there. You are at fault for your obvious biases-not challenging Biden's lies and interrupting Trump over 35 times. A debacle, terrible job.
Are U really such a dishonest partisan Dem that u allowed urself to openly side w/ Biden by not challenging all his lies and missteps and name-calling in the debate? U used charged left-phrasing in questioning Trump and softball half questionsw/ Joe. You've lost your credibility.
Biden not answering question on stacking supreme court, couldn't name one police union that endorses him....not worthless by a long shot
Why did Joe Biden get out of paying $500,000 in taxes himself?  The man is a liar and fraud, a panderer who will say/do anything for a vote. Do not trust him.
Ur defense of Biden's extreme racism is disgusting. That repugnant man is now pandering for votes from Blacks pretending he never made racist "jokes", never aligned himself with KKK Cyclops Byrd or George Wallace or opposed school integration or anything so repugnant.
As a life-long Republican, I cannot believe where you have taken the party. I will vote Biden and local Democrats until the Republican Party gets their act together. People over power!
And I‚Äôm convinced everyone voting for Biden is a pedo, seems legit right?
Yeah, I doubt Biden (and all Dems for that matter) will go quietly. Also a big concern of mine!
Time to turn off Fox News. They have move far left joining the MSM political bias agendas. Chris Wallace interrupted President Trump 75 times and Biden 15 time. I‚Äôm watching NewsMax and OANN.
This is coming to your neighborhood soon. If you watch MSM you are being censored from Democrats leadership lack of actions to stop rioting.  Biden and Harris are exposed for fund raising for bailouts money to rioters. BLM and Antifa are burning and looting businesses.
Biden appears to have gotten quite the bump from the debate.  He's speaking to at least 50 people at a time now.
‚ÄúI know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times ‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt mind apologizing over and over again. I can‚Äôt erase what happened.‚Äù after he left the klan and pos or not still don't mean Biden is hand in hand with the cult right? ü§î
This is Joe Biden‚Äôs last chance to run for Presidency, so expect lies, Broken promises, lies from the media  and  Flip / flopping on subjects or promises and strait up cheating to get in the White House.    sees the battle with evil he‚Äôs up against.
whenever asked, Trump switched to Biden's college, our how smart he was
Sleepy joe biden
Maybe Wallace and Biden need him to be more clear?!?!
Welcome back! We all become misguided in life but it‚Äôs how we dust ourselves off and get back up and on our feet again. No hate for this guy! let‚Äôs show him how Biden supporters treat people and just say Welcome Back
The difference imo is we can shape and manipulate Biden's position whereas Trump is DEAD SET on white supremacy and he can't even try to deny it when given the opportunity
ü§£ü§£ü§£ id pay money to watch but it would be short Biden would pee his pants and run off crying he almost did last night
I agree with Michael Steele:  we don't need anymore debates except the Biden/Pence Debate.  People just need to vote.  After last night's bar brawl, if you're still undecided, you are clueless!
My hope is there will be a Sino-Russo base in Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua........sooner than later. The possible Biden regime will revive the Obama/Hillary (R2P) Responsibility to Protect imperialist tactic.
OMG!  Looks like Biden wanted a photo of!  Chris Wallace should be fired!
It's true, President Trump did say this, yet Biden and the MSM still ignore this quote because it doesn't their narrative.
Awesome!  I just read on Facebook that a friend of a friend who voted for Trump is voting for Biden and so are her 15 family members who also voted for Trump!!
He's no Bernie Sanders, trust me I get that, but how are y'all gonna compare Biden to a xenophobic, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, WHITE SUPREMACIST wannabe dictator who doesn't pay taxes and is fighting to take away ppl's healthcare in the MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC???
As Biden did the same about the BLM or Antifa. I see Antifa destroying our city‚Äôs and streets and you folks ask about denouncing White Supremacy?? Why? Help me understand!
Keep Biden Away from the Kids. Dont let Dad Near the Ladies..... They said Noooooo guys.....
Crazy Uncle Donald Always getting Drunk at Christmas and a bit too rough with Aunt Ethel. Uncle Joe...... Hide the kiddos. He thinks he's an 8 year old boy. Sorry   I dont like Biden anymore than Trumptard himself! LOL
Trump acted badly,both spent most of evening talking about themselves,only thing that stuck on Biden was when Trump asked him to name a police depart endorsing him, niether of them gave a vision for america to define, Trump hurt himself but wont matter,Biden is not up to job

We only disagree on Biden Being Better, Bro. Neither is Better. We are wasting Our Vote Voting For Either One. What about the Other Candidates? We are Only Red and Blue? What happened to White? We are All Colors, From All Nations. Indivisible. Except divided..... by the elites..
Should all Be in Prison for Crimes Against Humanity.. Unless You all that voted for theses Idiots that waged War in Name of Democracy..... #fuckbothofthem vote for Yourself or Me.
Feckless Biden who had no specifics for his "plan," goes to his TELL: name-calling &amp; snickering his lunatic laugh when he was caught at something he said or couldn‚Äôt expand on. Future Idea: have "Other than Press" as moderators.

Biden got away with endless lies &amp; cheap shots. Questions were asked from a left perspective("science of climate change," what's wrong with "critical race theory" training," etc.).Biden went unchallenged by CW (at least 6 Big Lies Wallace passed on while interrupting Trump 35 Xs.
Chris Wallace's liberal bias was on full display. Disgraceful that VP Biden was allowed to ask the President to shut up, call him a clown and, with Wallace's help, a racist and white supremacist.
You asked Pres.Trump to"denounce white supremacists &amp; militias"  He already has and even put them on our terrorist list. Why didn't you ask Biden to denounce BLM and Antifa for their REAL destructionmof lives/property, looting, arson, beatings, killings? U=despicable yet again.
Biden stumbles and it‚Äôs funny. I‚Äôm not a pro trump or pro anyone for that matter, so quit getting sensitive and offended over every little thing.
You have one follower and came onto my post thinking you‚Äôre doing something. I never said a word about Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù and you took offense to my joke I was making. Quit thinking everthings so serious and take your sensitive self elsewhere bc it doesn‚Äôt belong on Twitter
I want details. I have never seen Trump be racist.  Biden, all the time: You can't go to a Dunkin Donuts or 7-11 w/o an Indian accent, constant racist jokes, pandering and patronizing to Black ppl. pro-segregation: school would be a "jungle" bff w/ KKKByrd, so much much more...
Biden did. It's on Twitter. You're terrible at journalism.
Biden did NOT grow up in Scranton-lie like all those about class standing, schools attended, 1st wife's death...When he can't answer a Q or is stuck, Joe has a TELL:He snickers w/ his s-eating laugh.Repulsive. I cannot imagine him in WH. Call out his other Whoppers, why don't you
At 12:01 PM on January 20, 2021, the Secret Service will no longer be taking orders from Donald Trump. They will be taking orders from President Biden.  I‚Äôm sure they will escort Trump to the door.
President Trump wins debate against Chris Wallace and second debate against Biden who didn‚Äôt answer any questions
Not sure but I think Wallace and Biden may have some history
Wrong!! Trump interrupted Biden 76 times! Nice try!!
Trump &amp; Biden are dumb &amp; dumber.
Here‚Äôs to you:
You are ok with Biden saying Antifa is an idea???
No because how else would he get in his points? He nailed it right from the get go stating he thought he was there to debate Biden not Wallace but turns out it was both. When else has a sitting President been treated so badly!!
Calling a sitting President a clown, telling him to shut up and calling him a liar in debate is far from winning..... Trump was on offense against two opponents üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏  when will Biden ever be asked the hard questions and answer then???

Trump was debating the MSM , the establishment and Biden. Unfortunate. Then asked if he denounces white supremacy when he already said he was placing them on the terror list. Biden can't answer w/facts so his TELL: name-call or laugh that (ugh) lunatic snicker. Joe in WH? NO!!!!!

Trump debated MSM, the establishment AND Biden. Joe went unchallenged by the moderator far too often (at least 6 Big Lies Wallace passed on challenging) while interrupting Trump 35 times!  Biden's Tell: can't answer with facts so name-call or laugh that (ugh) lunatic snicker.

The left talks a lot about #Trump‚Äôs misuse of words/misstatements yet when the misuse benefits their narrative they lose their üí©. read the transcription of the exchange. people hear what they want to hear. meanwhile #Biden gets a pass saying #ANTIFA is an idea.  #Hypocrisy
Joe Biden spotted wearing a wire during presidential debate  via
i changed my last name to biden now cuz i‚Äôm married to that sexc man
And yet, most people who responded to a Marco Rubio post on Facebook about the debate said that Trump won the debate and had a far better showing than Biden.
Whose joceyn Biden ?
Exactly. Narcissistic compulsive liars tell you what they‚Äôre planning when they accuse other people of things too. Everything he accuses the Democrats or Biden or the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù about is telling us his plans.
Anyone else having issues watching any of the Biden campaign videos? Mine just stall.

If Biden had stood there politely and allowed Trump to steamroll over him, you would have called him weak. There are no winners here.

I disagree, though Trump should of quit interrupting and let Biden bury himself .... it was a shit show .... all 3 of them
Biden, the puppet, you mean?  Stuffed with cotton batting and offering Nothing of substance, no details, facts --name-calling when he couldn't answer a question? that monster?  And you'd want that lunatic in the WH?!

You made 35 interruptions of Trump but none of Biden who lied at least 6 Big Ones u did not challenge. Obvious whose side you took. You lost control w/the first question but wouldn't have had you insisted on details/facts from hapless puppet Joe&amp;allowed Trump to fully answer his.
Considering that Biden lies like he breathes--I counted at least 6 big ones that Wallace failed to challenge Biden on.  No surprise from the Liberal moderator! Biden lies go back to childhood, schooling/class standing/scolarships, segregation sympathies, even 1st wife's death.

You mean it's impossible to get a true word out of Biden who lied at least 6 Big one Wallace failed to challenge. Nor would he give details on any "plans" and resorted to name-calling when asked for specifics. Biden is a hapless loon..someone you want in the WH? Despicable man.
Biden guilty!! He lies like he breathes.Counted at least 6 big ones Wallace failed to challenge. No surprise from the Liberal moderator! Biden lies go back to childhood, schooling/class standing/scolarships, segregation sympathies, even 1st wife's death. Congential liar hypocrite
A great line considering that Biden lies like he breathes-  counted at least 6 bigs ones Wallace failed to challenge him on. No surprise from Liberal moderator! Biden lies go back to childhood, schooling/class standing/ scolarships, segregation sympathies, even 1st wife's death.
If I were Biden fan, I'd want him to stay away from finances. B neglected to pay $500K+ taxes himself via loopholes. He AND family r opportunists linng their big pockets while Biden was in office.Truth? Trump prepaid his taxes in the $millions which the NYT now has to confess.
Bidens failed to pay over $500,000 in taxes. If I were a Biden fan, I wouldn't want to get into Biden finances...Hunter, his brothers (both of them) all shady opportunists while Biden was in office.
Proud Boys celebrate Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòstand by‚Äô remark about them at the debate.  #RacistTrump
Way to promote joe Biden  and  this morning on outnumbered by bashing the president and you did everything to could to label him as a racist. For shame
Biden lied continually (I caught at least 6 times that Wallace did not challenge) and when he could not answer a question, he resorted to name-calling. He did not detail one plan, backed off every time he was asked specifics. That brain dead lunatic is what you'd want in the WH?

Chris Wallace lost control from the first question. He was not a good moderator, refused to challenge at least 6 lies Biden made yet raked over Trump every opportunity. This debate was not informative and lost it for all 3 men.
As disgusting as the proud boys comment is, I think it's equally disgustinghe besmirched Biden's military vet sons, including highlighting Hunter's cocaine use and Biden giving him a job like he hasn't been paying his own daughter to ogle over her daily for years.
Biden NOT serious about anything. He didn't come across as really wanting to do anything, refused to detail any "plans" and resorted to name-calling when he couldn't answer the harder questions. Come on, Man, Biden is a disastrous joke.
Biden has NO plans; he will do what his puppet masters want him to do. He proved he is a feckless, brain dead bully last night. He couldn't even stand up for what he says he has plans for. Obama/Biden took 5+ months to come up w/ plan for H1N1 and only by Grace of God did it stop
This is the moment that made me want to kiss Joe Biden on the mouth.
Biden lies the way he breathes, constantly.
I live in the suburbs and after that debate I am doubling down on Joe Biden! Biden seemsto offer a plan to make Law and Order Great Again!
If you think that Hunter Biden is the problem you may want to do a bit more research into the family you‚Äôre supporting.
Lol...clearly based on the disaster that Portland has become due to the lack of law enforcement...you are a big Biden supporter. My guess is the people that work for you have a much different opinion than you.
2 things about last nights debate, that I watched very late last night, after I had heard all of the post game commentary (figured I better watch it)..... Thought Biden did much better than some were saying, thought Trump looked lost
I didn't watch it live, then I saw all the commentating so figured I better watch it in case I get asked questions in my government class, I thought Biden did quite well, about as well as he could in that environment; thought Trump looked lost, angry, aloof
Y‚Äôall, if after last night you are still equating Biden and Trump, I‚Äôm just gonna block your ass, because you‚Äôre too stupid to leave the house unaccompanied.
watched the debate late last night, after listening to analysis of the debate. Thought Chuck Todd's it was a trainwreck but a trainwreck of ones doing was on point. Thought Biden did pretty well, Trump looked like a 6th grader who can't read, can't write, but can yell and scream
I agree....Biden is dangerous!
NO! Joe Biden said, ‚ÄúOf course I want law &amp; order. Every one does. I simply want law and order WITH JUSTICE FOR ALL PEOPLE‚Äù  WE HEARD JOE SAY IT.  if you weren‚Äôt so busy being a loud obnoxious brat you might have heard his response too.
Biden inflicting train stories on us now for the 700th time.

How many Republicans will condemn what Trump said. I made it easy for you:  1. I'm concerned.  2. I didn't hear it  3. That's not what he meant 4. Fake news 5. I didn‚Äôt watch it 6. Well Biden said... 7. What about..... 8.  I‚Äôm convinced Trump is not the answer. I was wrong.
Biden cheats during debate and lies on national TV.  Yes Democrats will cheat with voting ballots
Joe Biden promise to take Trump out back and deal with him
Trump had to win against two, Biden and Chris tried but both to weak for President Trump.
President Trump won the debate with Chris Wallace as Biden moderates. Chris now a leader in the Democrats party gets high marks from Schumer and Pelosi. Unfortunately Chris Wallace will not be at the next debate to be wing man for Biden.
Except that Biden is correct. Jesus, Megyn, have some self-respect.
Trump interrupting both the moderator and Biden
I‚Äôm not here to back up any of these chumps. But Biden first and trump second sounds dumb af when there‚Äôs a thing called the position of honor üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you could just look at it that way? Lmao
Watching the debate now, was at practice during, Biden was solid, Trump looked lost during most, made some points but overall looked like a fool
Mom when the tangerine asshole goes after Biden‚Äôs SON: GO OVER THERE AND KICK HIM IN THE NUTS, JOE.
Biden doesn't have to pick one.  Wallace said that.  Is this nonsense all you guys have?  Good luck winning an election with this.
Biden didn't bring it up. Trump did. Unbelievable. Biden then defended his son. That's a real man.
Biden is a liar and Wallace is in the tank for Biden.

Why wld joe do that when trumps negative ads are running here in ARIZONA non stop all day and night Joe Biden needs to go full force but we all know he won't why? Cause he's an actual gentleman and human being but Me #ZeroSympathyForTrump #FlushTheTurdNov3rd
-Joe Biden, probably
All I've got to say is currently they offer more policies Biden supporters want than Biden offers you, like police reform, defunding, demilitarization, end no knock raids, end war on drugs etc. No candidate is perfect, but all Biden offers is $15/hour and "I'm not Trump"
With how many Republicans we have in there now I doubt it will happen. Even if Biden wins they're going to fight him on any gun control.
If Biden creates an unconstitutional law, he's the one breaking it. If people fight back, they're enacting the 2A.
Yeah the problem is Biden policies aren't reasonable. 2A is about preventing the rise of a tyrannical government by giving the people firepower to keep the power in check. Banning just about everything isn't reasonable, that's how you end up like China.
It be like that. It's ridiculous. Biden doesn't even want pistols with over 10 round mags. My CCW has 12 and 15 round mags they don't even make a 10 round for it.
Go read Biden's website man. It's all on there. He wants to ban all future purchases of the majority of weapons and make you have to pay $250 NFA tax stamps for your existing ones AND the magazines. No gun owner can afford that during these times. There will be non-compliance.
Even banning the new purchase of weapons without taking the ones already owned is technically Biden breaking the supreme law of the us and violating our rights. If my future children can't buy weapons, I'm fighting for their right to be able to with the ones I got.
You need to get enough states to agree to do that. Otherwise it would be Biden who is breaking the law and violating citizens rights. That's the exact tyrannical government the 2A was written to prevent. If people fight back they're justified in doing so.
Yeah. Imo if Biden wins, Trump supporters will start the war.  If Trump wins, Biden supporters will start the war.  Libertarians will just let them fight it out and loot all their gear üòÇ  If Jorgensen wins, both sides get some policies they both really want. No war.
On my way to get my hair cut, I have to drive through Trumpville. All those damn trumppence banners flying bigger than our nation's flag. I couldn't stop myself yelling, "Trump is a traitor, go Biden Harris", lol. FYI I made it home, lol.
So if Biden wins then enacts a mandatory buyback of weaponry without amending the Constitution and people fight back, they would be justified. The blood from both sides will be on the hands of Biden and his supporters.
Hasan doesn't like biden
Voting against myself would be voting for Biden or Trump.  Jorgensen is the only candidate I'm excited to vote for that will give real change, for real people.  You're the one voting against yourself. Just remember when the drug war &amp; no knock raids kill more people, it's on you.
Well I'm not trying to tell you how to think or vote, just offering different viewpoints.  Jorgensen = Demand a living wage yourself and pay less taxes.  Biden = Just another inadequate minimum wage increase.  Ultimately the decision is up to you.
Yet you Biden supporters complain about peaceful protestors being gassed and fired upon by the government for a photo op.  The 2A is about fighting a tyrannical government.  How about all of you arm yourselves and actually do something about it?
I've never personally been opposed to that, but Biden isn't even going to give you a living wage.  Biden proposes $15/hour but the reality is a living wage in modern times should be $25/hour.  I'd rather take my chances with Jorgensen, I can demand more AND pay less taxes.
That's another reason why I'm voting Jorgensen.  Trump promised to repeal unconstitutional gun laws but he didn't and he never passed any Pro-2A bills.  Jorgensen will actually do it. Trump will continue to just ride the line and with Biden well...see the cowboy meme.
Will Biden defund/demilitarize the police that gassed and fired on your neighbors for a photo op?  No, Biden won't. He actually supports giving more funding to the police.
He doesn't wear them, he made fun of Biden for it!!  üòÇüòÇ  He gets what he deserves
No we do care about Trump but if Joe gets it we won‚Äôt give a F!!!!. He is a pansy woos...hopefully Trump spit on him during the debate that he destroyed Biden in.
Looks like a Biden supporter found us.  So when the ATF shows up to conduct a no-knock raid, shoots your dog on the way in, then finds absolutely no illegal firearms anyways and just tells you to deal with it that's all fine with you?  Because that's a REAL story, bro.
Even if he did mean "Trump" and "Biden", what kind of HORRIBLE person have you all elected?  Who does this?  I haven't wished death on anyone.  I want justice, but that's coming.   Enjoy gitmo when we get to justice.  Pure evil.
HELL NO!! BIDEN AND HARRIS SHOULD GO FULL FORCE #FlushTheTurdNov3rd #VoteHimOut #TrumpLiedPeopleDied
Biden has to be strip searched and xrayed.
Yeah. People aren't buying all the ammo up for no reason. I feel like if Trump or Biden wins the the losing side will start it. If Jorgensen somehow managed to win I feel like both sides would get some of the policies they both want and the left/right wouldn't go to war.
just held a Trump sycophant to bringing evidence of a false claim about Biden and I am all about it. This is what needs to happen EVERY TIME!
Yes &amp; she corrected herself....so what's your point? She's human? We all make mistakes? Joe Biden lied on that stage on every issue. So there's a "bid" diff between a mistake &amp; a LIE!
The funniest part is when Vice President Biden called you a clown on national tv. We laughed our asses off.
Tim was ALMOST as disgusting as the jerk in the Oval Office! The LOSER of the debate were Americans! We learned 45 has NO plan, just HATE. When Biden tried to talk, #BullyInChief came on like a f‚Äôing blow horn! #45NeedsAShockCollar #45NeedsZoomWithMUTE #NotSoPresidentialDebate
It's one of the dam if he does can if he doesn't! As a plain old We The People, I would have walked out after about 30 minutes! I was a victim of abuse &amp; trump was in full blown attack modeüò¢ I think that's why Biden got a big from his wife &amp; trump forcefully held his wife's hand
Biden is living in Trumps head rent free
A moderator that debated Trump &amp; asked him combative questions! Go soft on the corrupt &amp; I mean corrupt Biden...wire, contacts &amp; all!
Morning Marine,  I love how Trump got biden to say he doesn't support the Green New Deal.  It's on his website!  What a lying sack of sharts!
Hmmm 47 years.....what has Biden done?
I've never seen anything so disrespectful as tonight how Joe Biden talked to the President of the United States!
His plan is the Biden plan instead of the Green new deal.
anyways, aside from Trump being a child, let‚Äôs talk about how Biden never brought up trumps family, but Trump continued to talk about Biden‚Äòs dead son and make fun of the living one üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Are you kidding me??? Joe calls him the President a clown twice &amp; tells him to "Shut up Man!" Very very disrespectful &amp; all the lies Biden was telling! Pathetic!
did Biden stutter? yes. yes he did, but remember that he leGITIMATELY HAS A STUTTERING DISORDER!! STOP MAKING FUN OF HIM FOR IT,  THAT IS ABLEIST!
It was horrible but I have to give it to Biden, because for the most part I felt he kept his cool.  I don‚Äôt know if many people could have done better with the nonsense coming out of his opponents mouth.
Probably because The Biden's paid him
FOR REALS!! Biden should have went off when that happened!!
That was dirty. Biden should attack his ass next time! Keep mentioning Putin and trump gets weak..
Being honest. The only things I remember Biden saying were the snappy one liner cut downs.  #USdebates
Now we know Biden has someone tweeting for him. Can‚Äôt even manage his own twitter account. How can we trust him to manage our country.
I OUT OF MY OWN POCKET have spent more on school supplies for my wife‚Äôs students than this man has paid in federal taxes. That‚Äôs unacceptable. #BidenHarris2020 #fucktrump #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday #biden #biden2020

I think without some FOX News Hosts/Entertainers &amp; without #TrumpRepublicanEnablers Biden would be ahead by 30 points too!

You guys really need to wake up. The dems are passing this around right now before the debates so Biden can change the subject and get the light off all the corruption he has been involved with while he was a part of the government.
Enough is Enough! Lift the Restrictions and the Bondage our society and world is in. Free the World from this scheme!! Joe Biden and the Democrats want to keep this thing going and going with no end in sight and some of you folks actually think that‚Äôs a great idea?????
I say we ask Biden what he wants to do , not what Crazy Nancy wants.
WHOOPSY---GOP report claims Hunter Biden paid women linked to ‚Äòprostitution or human trafficking ring‚ÄôNot even worth replying to you. Biden gets elected we will all get a  crash course on socialism. Stupid people don't even realize it
Pro biden will do
Why would he want to avoid another debate when he owned biden in the first one. Makes zero sense to avoid it. He'd want to debate him again just to kick his ass more.

Biden is a puppet. He will be a president for no one. He will be however the mouth piece for marxism
Hunter biden says fuck off.
If Biden steals this election, we all may be screwed
Felt the same way initially but; Trump got biden to say he is anti green new deal, dissed sanders, anti defund police. Claimed he is the democratic party but went against some major planks in their platform. He refused to answer questions and was carried by wallace. Be vigilant
The more corruption of Ilhan Omar that is exposed, the more emboldened she becomes. The same is true for Joe Biden. The more his lies go unchallanged, the more emboldened he becomes. This is the democrat party, strenghtened by lies and corruption.
You're either voting for American Democracy (Joe Biden) or white supremacy (Trump). The choice is clear.
Wallace probably read biden a bedtime story before he left!
Right Johnny lets hope all logical thinking ppl got the picture of Biden at debate arguing,name calling belittling,giving wrong answers,not answering questions so unprofessional of a 47yr political passed leader President Trump will lead Our USA 2 victory
He didn't lie.  Why didn't Wallace ask Biden to denounce the riots?? Denounce antifa??  Oh wait, antifa is just an idiology...right
No kidding. Thank God obama and biden were voted out
Woulda, coulda, isn't there, so Biden got crushed
You are right! I refered to it as a cluster. The more i think about it, the more i see President Trump's strategy. He got Biden to deny the lefts positions and lied non stop.  Well done Mr. President!
But did that come up as a question to Biden?
If President Trump did what Biden wanted 400 k would be dead.
I think draw. Because not a lot of questions were really answered in my opinion anyway. I hope the President lets Biden talk in the future. His ideas are so far out there he will hirt himself.
Sorry to say this but I think because the POTUS was not allowing Biden to talk. I am voting Red but I don't think the President did much to really help himself this time. Maybe I don't know how debates are run but I thought that both sides should be able to voice their opinions
It was a cluster.  President Trump did interupt alot, Biden lied like always, and Wallace ran interference for lying Joe. President Trump did get some good points in though.
If biden wasn't given the questions then why did he keep referring to notes? He didn't walk on with them so obviously someone put them there  #ChrisWallace
I guess I missed a lot. I was laughing because of President Trump was not letting Biden talk amd Chris was trying to stop him. Not much got done in this debate. I am voting for the POTUS but I wish he would have not interrupted as much.
Hiden Biden I mean cmon man is lost
I thought biden was going to wink at wallace at one point
Debate outcome:  Trump- "I support freedom, the people are smart enough to do what needs to be done." - american freedom.  Biden- "I will mandate everything, the government will make you to what your told." - Communism #Trump2020 #BidenTrumpDebate  #BidenLies #voteforfreedom
Joe Biden was a little to prepared. He must have had the questions prior.
Biden stumbled everywhere, admitted Hunter had a drug problem, was the only one throwing insults around, overall embarrassed himself!!  #Trump2020 #TrumpWon
What does it matter? PDT is always treated unfairly.  #JoeBiden was wearing an earpiece. 3 against one! #chriswallace #biden and #EarpieceJoe There's your 3   #debate
Hunter Biden, had a drug problem...  (Well played Trump!)   #Trump2020  #BidenCorruption #Biden #realDonaldTrump
Biden got away with telling the same old lies
The only name calling, came from Biden.  The only insults, came from Biden.  Anyone here bought insulin recently? Pretty sure that was the first "lie" Biden claimed.  Also, I have seen Biden calling the troops "stupid bastards". I saw that and it wasn't even hard to find!
You don't care about Beau Biden?
And how tf would we be poorer under trump? I‚Äôm not lying when I say that I am in the best financial situation I have ever been in. And if Biden is elected then my taxes will be so high that it would be unaffordable for me to even live. I‚Äôd lose my job and my employer said so.
Funny, an audience member called into Rush's show today and said #ChisWallace helping #JoeBiden is what will turn the debate around to Biden's favor. #RushLimbaugh didn't seem to bye that theory... seems he had his own. ü§î
Bro. Now Biden is just straight lying too! And everytime he gets caught he just says he doesn‚Äôt want to answer the question!üòÇ
How could you possibly vote for Biden? Socialism is his entire platform
Important unanswered question, will Joe Biden pack the court?
Oh and that shoe fits Biden OH so well, hate that man with a fiery passion lmao.
How is joe biden tweeting during the debate??
Biden just created a meme with the Will you shut up, man.   #BidenHarris
He‚Äôs making a lot of sense. With Biden lying about obama‚Äôs and his shitty economy by saying it wasn‚Äôt that bad, that really says a lot. Under trump, wether you like it or not, has made this countries economy the best it has ever been and Biden doesn‚Äôt want to accept it.
Did Hiden Biden really come out on stage and say to our President... How you doin man ?  What a bafoon
No one, even Biden supporters, believe the polls
You just said moron in democrat...Joe Biden
You must be talking about Biden.
Biden can't/hasn't worked two days in a row. How can he run the country?
No drug breaks for Biden
Why does he need 2 breaks for a 90 minute debate? Ut oh, looks like the biden people are looking for a way to back out, especially making this request today
Remember Oct. 2019 when Biden was on the campaign trail in SC. While giving a speech he said he attended a HCBU, Delaware State University. He lied. Biden was never a student at DSU. Biden has no shame lying to the black community for votes
Joe Biden will do just fine tomorrow night.

Numbers are right there. That's reality. But you just wanna jump on trump for having huge rallies while biden hides. That's the reality. üòä
Why because you don't have confidence and Biden?
Are you just saying that because you're afraid that Biden will blow it?
declares we are in a climate emergency. Last time govt declared a fake emergency (covid), they put citizens on lock down and destroyed the economy. Dont give Biden the opportunity to force green new deal on us. Vote Trump! Vote red!
Bummer. I thought he was sending cash. I was going to split it between Joe Biden and Mark Kelly.
Biden is barely alive..1. Biden himself admitted taxes will raise 2. There is a difference between knowing how to take advantage of the tax codes obama implemented and cheating 3. Trump doesn't pay income tax because he has no income. He puts the money back into his businesses. It's completely legal
Except trumps tax cuts have value. The point of them was to allow corporations to do more in country manufacturing, etc. Creating more jobs and higher wages, covid interrupted that. Also, what do you think will happen if biden wins? Taxes will skyrocket...for everyone
Anyone that says they like The Racist Pedophile Biden is lying, he‚Äôs done absolutely nothing for 47 yrs.
Stop spreading your fear mongering lies of projection and deceit! And furthermore, WHO ARE YOU to determine whether Joe Biden should or should not debate any further!?  You imply he‚Äôs not able to make decisions on his own! STFU!
‚ÄúYou stupid bastards‚Äù a Joe Biden doozy.
Nope I got nothing! All Biden has ever done was create roadblocks, more taxes and hate
Biden had 47 years to do this, not to mention from 2008-2016
Not true. Biden's fans were on the opposite side of the audience...wearing masks!
Trump paid little in taxes because politicians like Biden wrote the tax code.
Neither'll listen though; even if Biden is better than Trump, if you seriously think we're going to get meaningful change from a neoliberal blue dog like him then you're mistaken.
Yes in Arizona - same as Biden and Kamala  As an Arizonan - we‚Äôre doomed (again) by this jackassery

Of course they did. He wanted so much to debate Biden that he came late and could not be tested.
He can do more that way than Biden in person. At least he can finish a sentence and convey an idea. Biden not even sure where he is.
Biden isn't president you're still free

I agree.  Biden seems more fragile.  If either died before, would their party go ahead with election as is and then go to the backup in place, or would another election be done since the person running as president wouldn't have been actually sworn in?  Probably a simple answer.

Is this Trumps escape plan? Too sick to continue or be prosecuted then talk about how he would have won? Then his cult can claim Biden gave it to him at the debate and shit will really hit the fan
Praying you and the first lady get better soon.  We need you in this country... We can not be left with Biden he is not good for the people in this country, it scares me thinking of him as the president.  We need a president who loves this country and the people in it. üá∫üá∏üëç
Trump pushes for RBGs replacement while her body is still warm, and you‚Äôre wanting Biden to show empathy for a man that just put him and his wife‚Äôs life in danger by suspending his campaign? Hell no it‚Äôs time to put a real President in the White House.
Had he not, those same people would be saying "I don't know about Biden, he seems a little weak,he didn't stand up for himself much."
What if this is a chess move to then have Biden test positive, drop out of the presidential election and nullify all the mass mailed ballots and stop the Dems from stealing the election?
trump got covid hopefully biden next
The worst part was he was at an indoor fundraiser today and didn‚Äôt have a mask and an outdoor rally last night with thousands of people and no masks. I hope he didn't give it to Joe Biden!

Will biden denounce black lives matter and Antifa for all the assaults, murder, propert damage in the billions. These are his base.
Now this is interesting to discuss because when the moderator asked trump if he condemned white supremacy he said ‚Äúsure‚Äù and then he asked them to name a group. One of the videos picked up someone or Biden over all the ruckus say ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù and that‚Äôs when he made that comment

Especially when Biden has NEVER condemned Antifa. Not once.
Biden won‚Äôt answer questions. Dumb dumb
Would have been a total knockout had Wallace not run to Biden‚Äôs corner to give him so much aid. He evaded most questions.
How about fair moderation first, then Trump won‚Äôt have to point out Biden not answering questions. Wallace was like a referee trying to keep Biden on his feet.
It is extremely clear Joe Biden has no clue who ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù are, that how they told him to deflect anything regarding Antifa. It‚Äôs interesting that they pick Proud Boys denouncing as the Trump Bash Topic of the Week- Riots and Looting and Fires and Shooting-proud boys? ü§î

CNN ‚Äúfact checked‚Äù and claimed that Biden NEVER claimed that the China travel ban was xenophobic.
Diamond and Silk made a great point.  Why don‚Äôt the Democrats denounce White supremacy?  They are the party of KKK. Mr. Biden is in pictures and videos with a KKK leader.  PLUS denounce Antifa and BLM.   Remember their game: to blame &amp; accuse R, it‚Äôs what D‚Äôs are doing &amp; believe.
Considering Biden‚Äôs performance in the last debate where his normal defenders would say stuff like ‚Äúthis is the worst debate ever‚Äù and ‚Äú This is the best our country can come up with.‚Äù We are going to need a better explanation than ‚Äúdebate prep.‚Äù

Wouldn't call myself a Biden supporter, but don't think the country will survive four more years of Trump. The divide in this country is massive and he's a big cause of it.
Neither. But I'll be voting Biden simply because I don't think the country will survive another four years of Trump.

I guess everyone forgets what Biden says! Just a reminder!
Wait a minute, what I saw last night was Chris Wallace giving everything including a binky and blanket to Biden. Totally disrespected the President!  Worst mediator ever! Did not give him respect enough to answer or refute questions like he did for a Biden. My vote for Trump!
It's not ignorance if I have spent hours multiple days researching which candidates i will vote for, not just for president, but every other position too. There is maybe 1 thing i like about biden at most. If anything, some of the libertarian views i like more than democratic
Good catch Red. I like the fact that tweet was march 18th when Biden claims "I told him what to do then and then again in July".
Sun City AZ is hardcore Trumpville. There are more Biden signs. Not enough.
bull shit he was was totally for Biden never made him answer the questions ask of him.. they both didn't let the president answer anything
I saw this just from the highlights... some would say well biden this or that... its like a fight.. the champion has to show why he's the champion and trump did not do that... its why biden actually looks good cause of it
In the next debates Joe Biden needs to say. Now that you are informed who the proud boys are, well you in front of America denounce them

Shouldn‚Äôt you be mad at Joe Biden and Obama for their tax laws they? From the looks of you I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd take advantage of any loop hole you could. It‚Äôs funny the  leftist bitch about the system and supports the two people that have been the system for 47 years. Makes sense?
It's simple. President Trump will be reelected and the policies that have helped to revive this economy from the stagnant years of the Obama/Biden administration will continue to bring growth and good paying jobs. And that Greta is what the middle class(and I'm one of them)wants.
Mine has been up for 2 weeks. My wife felt uncomfortable too. But I will not live in fear. We own guns too, you trespass or try to steal, face the consequences
The thing is Biden saying he doesn‚Äôt support the green new deal might hurt him with his base and Lower enthusiasm. If Bernie was the nominee, there would be much more enthusiasm
I am sorry if you don‚Äôt understand this but they aren‚Äôt changing the rules to help Biden because he did a great job. They didn‚Äôt lower the mound in baseball because bob Gibson‚Äôs opponents did a great job hitting his pitches.
Hell yes I do. He should have also brought up the rest of the Biden Mob Family that has profited off Pedo Joe's 47 year career!
Dan Bongino sees last night as a big win for Trump in that his goal, was to divide and conquer. He skillfully drove several wedges into the Biden coalition eg by having Joe admit he is against the Green new Deal. The Trump people love him even more while the Left was sold out.
No joke, Biden standing up for Hunter was the first time I ever liked him.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more with you. And set aside, his own kids are this and that. Because they are. It shows how there is absolutely no connection to humanity at all.   And when Biden talked about his son, Beau. And this is the person America wants their kids to look up to?
Biden is attempting a coup by being compassionate, speaking in complete sentences, and having concrete plans to enact policies that help--not harm--Americans.

You don't.  I think Biden should cancel the rest of the "debates" on the basis that Trump won't shut up.
Can you still say that after Wallace interrupted Trump 75 times and Biden only 16?  Wallace was awful and I would like to see his cronies at Fox call him out on it. #ChrisWallaceIsAJoke #TrumpWon
So basically Joe Biden has no problem destroying the economy of the USA for a leftist pipe dream. Just say no go Joe. #NOGOJOE
Can we please remember that Biden has over come his stutter. He‚Äôs not slow, it‚Äôs the remnants of his affliction.
He got biden to distance himself with the AOC/bernie crowd which will hurt voter enthusiasm for him. That is actually very big but no one wants to talk about because it's not flashy.
Looks like Biden is speaking to about 20 people in Alliance OH.  Big crowd for him. Occasionally losing his place.
Wallace baited Trump and gave Biden hugs and kisses. Forget every other moment in last night's debate except this one Jedediah. If Chris Wallace is such a stand up journalist then why would he bring up the Charleston White Nationalists lie?
Did you hear Biden call the President a clown and told him to shut up and the military stupid. What do you think he would call the everyday people? He does not have respect for people and all of these are on video, you have to wonder how he treats people that is NOT on video.

You are right, a friend texted me last night during the debate. She is not a Democrat. She was horrified watching Trump in action and angry how he hijacked the debate and interrupted Biden the whole time. She never saw what a complete nut case Trump is until last night.

He lobbed soft balls at Biden all night.  Trump wound up asking Joe all the tough questions that liberal Wallace refused to ask.  Chris is a biased joke.
That was such a confusing interchange. He really needs to be decisive about his answers. Considering how Trump was such a bully and lacking in dignity and intelligence, Biden came off better than I thought he would. I was pissed from the first minute.
Chris Wallace: Truly awful job as moderator. You lobbed the usual soft balls at the VP, and you shushed at POTUS' interruptions, but not Biden's. Thankfully, POTUS asked Joe questions that you refused to. Judging by your co-workers' faces, they weren't impressed by you either.
I noticed the difference. Trump and melania barely touched each other, she even tried pulling away from him. Joe &amp; Jill Biden were affectionate towards each other.

Biden was never president so...
So all of the stores that were looted and burned is just an idea of what the antifa was thinking about doing.  I guess it really didnt happen.....it was just an idea.  WOW....biden is on top of our crises and has all the answers.....we are all in deep shit if he is elected.
China is so hoping that biden is elected......they will have control of America if biden is in the white house.  Biden is weak and our enemys will run all over us if biden gets elected......

Trump is President of the United States.....he is here to run our Nation and follow the constitution.....Not to fulfill a wish of a justice that has become a hater. AND.....if the tables were turned and biden were president....he would do the same thing.

I think Trump was very perceptive early on to sense he was debating Chris Wallace, not Biden and call Wallace out for that.
Trump wasn‚Äôt the one calling Biden a clown, or saying shut up! You call that a person of sound mind!
Biden has been running on the ‚Äú I will bring back norms and decency‚Äù platform. Tonight while trump made some nasty attacks Biden did way more and that hurts Biden‚Äôs main platform. Even if they did the same amount it would look bad for Biden since he is supposed to be for decency
.....Chris wallace was clearly bias in his moderation of the debate........helping biden to keep on track and basically acting as bidens teleprompter.  At times it appeared Trump was debating wallace and not biden.  wallace argued with Trump as much as biden.

Here's the thing Red. Trump needs to focus on the camera. That's the American people. Biden did exactly that by reaching out where Trump focused on Wallace and Biden. There were so many opportunities to hit hard and he missed them. Trump scored some points but I was not impressed

Hunter Biden is a real person with real earned jobs. No Trump child could make that assertion.
I am glad Biden held it together. You could see him taking deep breaths when you know he wanted to lash out. And, I am here for the zingers that Biden got in!!!
Debate comments: there is increasing evidence that the Democrats continue to define Donald Trump in their own image. I.e.Biden told multiple whoppers while accusing DT of lying.
Why is it Chris Wallace never letting our President finish what he wanted to say. He constantly let Biden say anything he wanted. Wallace gave Biden his binky and blanket for most the night. Disgraceful of FOX and Chris Wallace!!!
I think Trump.                              Pres. Trump was also debating Chris Wallace. Negative lean questions towards Trump- coaxing questions towards Biden. Many more interruptions for Trump with Chris Wallace. Not a huge win, but a lot chaotic.

That Joe Biden should not debate Trump again. Chris Wallace was a terrible moderator. He allowed Trump to hijack most of the debate. Every single time Biden spoke, Trump interrupted. Chris Wallace would just go on to the next question. Just awful.

Well they should because our constitution makes it a crime to actively make death threats or make attempts to kill the President. I think out of the respect for the position of POTUS if you can't say something positive just don't say anything. Have class like Joe Biden showed.

I remember watching this debate with my parents. I thought about it during the Biden Trump debate. What a difference.
The only reason you asked Trunp to denounce Whyte Supremacy (after he has done so 18+ times) is because Joe Biden has been running a factual lie of an ad) why didn't you ask Joe about his slanderous ad? You let Joe slide on Blatant lies #JournalismIsDead
The Democrats are now playing a 'Good Cop Bad Cop Routine' to Make Joe Biden look like a nice guy.  Nice guy's do Not condone Murdering Babies and all their Party's other Destructive Policies.  If, Joe Biden did not believe in all the Democrat Policies, he would Not be Democrats.
Who is saying this? This is very important, because it involves possible exposure to the Bidens at the debate! They need to go on the record. This explains Kayleigh McEnany's evasiveness yesterday. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deserve the truth! Mike Pence needs to hold a presser.

All the DEBATES, are and will be done by the Democrat Media, always favoring Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  All the follow-up coverage will always favor the Democrats.  Still President Trump, has to put himself out there for more abuse from these Treasonous Democrat Liars.
Votes don't default to Biden, "a vote for not Biden and not Trump is a vote for Trump" is an incoherent argument.  Stop spouting your illogical bullshit and stop vote shaming, Libs!
Votes don't default to Biden, your argument is invalid. You are illogical.  Stop vote shaming!
Votes don't default to Biden, your argument is invalid. You are illogical.  Stop vote shaming!
The Hillary Song  via  so the rock does this but endorses Biden and Harris
Actually they are probably expecting Biden to need votes.
I guess the biggest issues for me  Biden didnt condem Antifa Biden didnt answer if he would pack the court Biden lied about Hunter getting money from Russia Biden said he doesnt support Green New Deal, but his website says he supports it. Biden cant answer for the 300k vet deaths
Yea the left is pushing that hard but if you actually read the transcript wallace said stand down then biden said proud boys, than trump said stand back and stand by. He was trying to use the lingo that wallace used.
And I'm so mad 45 scares ppl with unrealistic scares like Biden wanting to close the economy, mail in voting fraud, violence by protestors, getting rid of police, it is all lies and bs and Biden has stated his stand but the Family can't comprehend truth.
Yesterday I was mad at work bc a tRumpette was saying the debate was going to be funny bc Biden has a gaffe. Ignorant ass, they are all bullies. Today a tRumpette was saying how awful that Biden called 45 a clown and how he lies. Delusional idiots.
Talk about a reverse GOTV strategy. Hey, thx for the uptick, Donnie. üëç Women will decide this election. I have often wondered if my blood pressure rises every time I see Dear Leader on TV. I find myself shouting at the screen. I absolutely LOVED it when Biden called him a clown.
Highest rating for Biden you idiot
And what does Hunter Biden know about the oil industry? Okay, I'll tell you, Ukraine. He knows how to read labels on the shelf. There comes another few million his way. Good for him.
I seriously don't blame Hunter Biden for taking millions out of the Russian Oligarchy / Treasury,  but next time send someone qualified to serve in the Military or at least qualified to make a hamburger at McDonalds.
In 1977, Joe Biden warned that without ‚Äúorderly integration,‚Äù his children would grow up in ‚Äúracial jungle, with tensions built so high that it is going to explode at some point.‚Äù  He was against court-ordered busing to desegregate public schools.
The reality Debate for America is Trump's Policies that work, or Biden's Policies that are a Disaster for our Country.  I will take Trump's policies every day of the week.  President Trump is a passionate President, that truly loves this Country and every patriotic American.
Good analogy, Jason. And Biden dealt with it head-on last night, looked right into the camera and talked about it on a personal level.
Didn't Richard Spencer recently support Joe Biden?
Biden never condemned Antifa or BLM rioters Unlike Trump has condemned KKK, NAZIS and white nationalists on multiple occasions.
Roe versus Wade is what Biden is running on...  Baby Killers are not even Human...
That was the moment I went from supporting Biden to being grateful for Biden.
I almost decided to vote democrat so my business would improve because I know they will fu$k up the economy but no amount of money is worth living in a Biden/Harris USA. TRUMP 2020.
My business was booming under the Obama administration. My business makes money on a bad economy. The first year of trump I lost 10% of my business. The last few years not counting Covid I lost another 60%. That only happens on a good economy. Biden is full of crap.
How many times does he have to do it? You know no matter how many times he does it, they will ask again and again, but Chris Wallace let Biden Slide with Antifa is an idea, not an organized group?
Will that be to FAct Check Joe Biden as well?
I know he isn't a dictator. That is my point. He would have to have an act of Congress to do so. Please work on your English Comprehension.
Desperate Donnie is nothing more than a carnival barker.  How Biden stood up for his son was the memorable moment.
I told russia to cut it out.  Remember that. There are records showing him and Biden agreeing to go after a 3 star general with a great record because he was on team Trump. How is that accepting to transition?
I doubt you will actually read this. Biden never condemned Antifa or BLM rioters Unlike Trump has condemned KKK, NAZIS and white nationalists on multiple occasions.
Content or context? Not really,  I thought both  and  did well, especially at smashing  like an ant on the sidewalk. But pro-abortion Catholic Biden came out a lot stronger than I expected. He should still call for a tee time.
It was not pretty, but the President was being Double Teamed, and Biden is full of Lies.
So I gather Biden did not run the Baudrillard kritik I suggested?
Biden REFUSED to use the orange foundation. STRONGLY no HALLOWEEN for the suburbs.
Biden needs to quit acting like he is one of the people. I have talked to a bunch of different soldiers and VETS that when they heard him say it, they were just like, STFU.
Funny how BIDEN is the one who said it first  It was a Direct QUOTE.
Even the Fox News poll showed that Biden won.
Dignity in America, where Presidents literally drone bomb American citizens without a trial? Where your president is a snake oil salesman that talks nice but is dirtier than septic tank cleaner? Biden did 47 years &amp; "his best" thing jailed 100 of thousands of black men.
I'm up 22 hours a day, and I rarely ask what I'm doing up. And  less than half of it is to promote  - half of what is says is nonsensical, especially in tweets. But he gets re-elected and I'm fine with that hope Biden enjoys his golf courses.
Not disagreeing at all but Biden Standing up Hunter was for me some form of antidote. It was the only moment of tonight's circus fire that I'll remember fondly.
I'd guess no. I would say Biden did a good job keeping his cool but definitely lied a lot and I hope people see that and TBH I'm disappointed in Chris Wallace he should never do another debate.
You are stuck on stupid cause Trump tried to talk over VP Biden all during the debate and over Wallace too!
I'm exercising my right in our democracy to vote for what I believe so I don't understand your point. I hate trump and have no faith in Biden. So why should I be bullied into voting for one of them.
When you as President have done a Great Job, like President Trump has.   It is hard as President to stand there and have everything Good you have done Twisted around.  I give our President Trump, a lot of credit for hanging in there while being Double Teamed by Wallace and Biden.
I believe Joe Biden uses Bo for pity, since he was a decorated war hero who died from a brain tumor... Which is sad that his good son died...  Joe Biden and Hunter are Not that good Son, and they have to be brought to Justice...  The only way to Question Biden is in a Debate...
I understand where you are coming from. I can't stand Trump and have zero faith in Biden. My views align with Jorgensen so that makes it easy for me. Political parties have changed quite often throughout history actually. Whether by name or ideology.
I'm not really locked in until I cast my vote.  I'm waiting to see what Arizona does. If it looks like a Biden win I'll go that way. If it's looking Trump, I'm voting Green.  Also, I might hang out on my roof and watch a poling place.
The Pandemic On Biden‚Äôs Watch Killed 13 Times As Many Children As COVID
Ann Coulter and Ben Shapiro are still who they are. They're still loathsome.  They were right about something.  Their underlying principles and assumptions and selves are still shit.  Biden's no different, right?
The next one is a townhall. Those are Biden's strong suit. 1 more.
Only that Chris Wallace is pro Biden
Aside from disputing the lies, Trump said about Biden's plans and policies.....?  Despite his stuttering disability Biden spoke more intelligently and presidential than the narcissistic con-artist representing himself and the REAL filthy rich.  Trump went LOW!
Then you better vote for Biden because Trump is owned by the Soviets.
Biden did nothing else for 47 years. Trump helped people of all races. Trump has 2 peace treaties in the making. North Korea to the table. Walked into the DMZ zone Replaced old derelict fence posts with 20 foot Bollard fencing. What has Biden done besides say racist stuff
Biden put more Black men in Chains than we have had since the civil war with his 94 crime bill. He wrote it. 3 strikes, drug possession and all. Biden is suffering from Alzheimer's
I thought Biden handled that very well tonight. He responded very matter-of-factly. I like that in a president. üëç
BIDEN NEVER DID  Rioters say we are ANTIFA means it is more than just an idea.  Keep shoveling your bull
The only Pressure Joe Biden is under right now, is remembering what to say.  President Trump has the whole USA and the WORLD on his shoulders in a Covid 19 crisis and trying to save our Economy.   Shutting-down America again or implementing Biden Policies will cause a DEPRESSION.
How about try to fact check Biden on the things about his son.  Hunter got $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow
When BIDEN IS LITERALLY LYING about all sorts of things. Wallace is not trying to correct him or interrupt him like he would try to interrupt Trump
Chris Wallace was a horrible moderator. Very pro Biden.
Trump 1, Biden 0, Wallace -0
HE has already done it multiple times before Biden tried to claim the Proud boys are White supremacists  They are over 20% racial mix
Joy Reid is right. Why would Joe Biden do another debate after trump‚Äôs clusterfuck tonight?
Joe Biden did have one Good Son in the Military.   That does not make the other Son or him good guys.
Just like Biden side stepped antifa and blm
Biden wouldn‚Äôt say Black Lives Matter
And Biden should have hit back with Ivanka‚Äòs dealings
45 can bitch and moan over votes all he wants, but I am voting Biden/Harris proudly. I'm also so mad at these damned Republicans that no matter what they stand for, I am voting Democrat straight down the line.
That voting statement is Biden's best moment of the night. #Debates2020
Trump's answer in one word: "coup".  Biden's answer in one word: "concede".
Biden is getting in the punches too, told him to ‚Äújust shut up man‚Äù and called him a clown ü§°
This Debate and the Questions asked are leading Trump into being Double TEAMED by Chris Wallace and Joe Biden.
I don't like Biden.  The only reason I am considering voting for him is to troll Trump.
Why didn‚Äôt Biden ask about Ivanka when Trump asked about Hunter?
FIRE CHRIS WALLACE FOR HELPING BIDEN MORE THAN A HOOKER GIVING A HANDY

Trump vs Biden best comedy special of 2020 #PresidentialDebate2020
There're awful, but fuck, I'll vote those guys any day over Trump or Biden.
And how many inaccuracies have Biden and his party said?
I want Biden to sniff Trump's hair.  I want Biden to chug a long neck, break the bottle over Trump's head and then stab him repeatedly.  I want Biden to tell Trump to "clap for me you dumb bastard."  I want Biden to proclaim a Socialist platform.  I will be disappointed.
Last debate thought before I log off: we need to force Joe Biden to punch a man to make sure he isn't a robot (and then check the man he punched to make sure *he* isn't a robot).
Only took them knowing Biden is going to lose. Lol this should of been months ago.
Roll a d6 for the R_T experience  1) We could have had Mitt 2) I appreciate that Joe Biden is wrong within normal parameters 3) We Could Have Had Mitt 4) I will pay Andrew Yang a basic income to shut the fuck up 5) This is just like Season 4 of PLL 6) WE COULD HAVE HAD MITT
Hopefully President Trump will ask Biden that question at tonight‚Äôs debate.
Biden advocating for apartheid to win Republican votes.  It would be funnier if it didn't seem so believable.
They and the Republicans are the ones that made the system that way. Joe Biden was in congress that ENTIRE time. Why didn't he stop any of it then?
Joe Biden was in congress the entire time the tax codes were changed to be used and possibly abused. How would he fix it now, when he didn't stop it then?
Biden, you claimed the travel bans would do nothing, and then claimed you would do a bunch of things Trump already did to help people. How would you have done anything different with the information you would have had at the time?
They complain about his business acumen. He was good enough that he used the system to pay less. Do I like that? No. Joe Biden had been in office 47 years while they made tax codes that way.
Trump wants the Trumpers watching the debate tonight to fixate on Joe Biden's perceived weaknesses. Some catchy phrase they'll remember tomorrow. It doesn't matter to any of them that it's not true. Deflection and targeting. Character assassination. False accusations and LIES.
Donald Trump should insinuate that Joe Biden is wearing adult diapers for incontinence and demand that they both be inspected nude by a neutral third party.
I promise: I'm a busy camper. I've already gotten 1,000+ locals to sign up to register and to vote. Around here, Biden doesn't stand a slowball's chance in hell. So you'd better watch out I'm a war machine.
Hey  does Alyssa mean "Vote Early" because she wants to avoid the October Surprise, or because she's worried by Nov. 3rd'd Biden will be in an Assisted Living Facility?
I'm voting, I'm debating from mail in to voting in person all because I don't want my vote to be invalidated. I'm voting for Biden and I want it to count. It is time for the  fraud and horrendous experiment to be over.
I'm voting Biden because I want to see Arizona flip blue.  Also, part of me is apparently a sado-masochist who wants to see the shit going down that I expect a Biden win to bring.
This response by Joe Biden is one for the ages. I love his sometimes-cutting wit. #Debates2020 #DrugTest #Vote #BidenHarris2020
Just watched a Biden Ad on TV. After 47 years in Politics his Motto should be "PROMISES MADE; PROMISES UNKEPT."
Liberalism will continue to push the US towards Fascism. A Biden presidency will not change this. At the best it will buy a little more time to prepare ourselves. It may also trigger Trump to launch a coup.  There are no good choices for President in 2020.
Showing true colors: That Time Joe Biden Called Members of Military "Stupid Bastards" - Was it Really a Joke? - Coal Region Canary
Imagine voting for Biden lol
One-fourth of it will be lies. Three-fourths of it will be repeats of those lies, chanted over and over again. I bet this presser will be about his latest fixation - the Joe Biden pre-debate drug test. Trump is scared sh**less about Tuesday.
Oh My! You Obviously got hit in the head a few too many times to endorse Biden/Harris! I know everyone is entitled to their opinion.... my opinion of yours is ü§¢ü§Æ
Trump is creating an excuse not to debate Vice President Biden.

What's wrong with wanting to focus on the welfare of your country? And kamala harris is identity politics, Biden is on record saying that people like me should feel validated now that she is on the ticket. As if I wasn't valid before.. Btw. Biggest flop in history, kamala went
By your logic, anyone who supports Biden, supports segregation, anyone who supports harris supports identity politics over logical politics.

He Advocated that Sanders was all for what he was wanting to do for the people, then turned around after trump hit him with what his real agenda was That Biden supported, increase taxes and raising minimum wage only for biden to "save" himself and
Thank you Joe Biden for putting on your mask, standing against ignorance and setting an example for the entire nation. Great leadership means being humble enough to listen to others &amp; respect their expertise. Thank you Dr. Fauci. COVID is real. Mask up.

Bingo.  Biden should attack Trump's failed coronavirus response that killed 204,000 and infected over 7 million.  In particular the medical access Trump has versus medical access for the general public.
Happy now? Biden has more class than Trump!
And HOW many Times Trump has made fun of Him ... Calling Him ‚ÄúSleepy Joe‚Äù and then attacking Biden‚Äôs Sons .... Biden is showing that He is much BETTER HUMAN BEING then Trump
Exactly, remember Trump stated if you vote for Trump you ain't black. Oh, that's right, that was actually Biden. My mistake.  It must have been Trump that called blacks super predators. Oh, that was actually Biden as well.  Hmmm, looks like Biden's the real racist. LMAO ü§£

You know he‚Äôs going to run over to interrupt Biden
lol bro i‚Äôm watching this debate. it‚Äôs hilarious how trump just tries to pwn biden no matter what. too bad this is reality bc it would be funnier as a movie.
Because when I think about LGBTQ rights I think of Jill Biden. Just like when I think of gangsta rap I think of Tipper Gore.
What's the verdict &amp; TRUTH ?  Joe Biden says in Debate  he doesn't support Green New Deal, but his website says otherwise,  the $110 Trillion dollar Green deal is unbelievable,  US Citizens couldn't pay for it individually or Govt wise without major TAX Increase on Everyone
:us: Go #Trump2020 Biden lied about a good economy under Obama, lied about #Trump not #Corona sinking explosive #job growth, lies about intent on #Healthcare, etc. He failed America over 40 years in congress. If he could do anything he promises why didn't he do any of it then?
:us: Go #Trump2020 Biden lied about a good economy under Obama, lied about #Trump not #Corona sinking explosive #jobs growth, lies about intent on #Healthcare, Lies about his support of black people,... Posted via Webtalk
Biden glossing over his son having a cocaine problem like he isn't directly responsible for the incarceration of thousands of Americans for drug charges
But. Vote for Biden. He‚Äôs not perfect, none of us are, and most would take the opportunity, if given, to call Trump much worse things then a clown. I just want to see him rise above. We are done with cry baby racists. Go high.
Joe Jorgensen is a better option than BOTH of the main party candidates. Biden and Trump are both pathetic and embarrassing.
He is not wrong and Biden can change that.
Just me but Biden seems to have rehearsed answers and every time Trump interrupted he just paused so he wouldn‚Äôt forget where he was in his scripted response. He would just stop and continue with his scripted response
And it showed.  Joe Biden did not wear a wire to aid him in the debate, Lead Stories and PolitiFact confirm
Sometimes to get rid if an illness we have to use an unfavorable treatment. Although Biden is not on my list of favorable choices I'll take that chemo to eliminate a cancer.  #Election2020
People will say Biden got dragged into the mud, but if he didn't fire back at all, the networks would say that he was weak and let Trump run over him.
The violence is coming from Biden voters.
Hillary, Trump or biden should‚Äôve either interrogated me or killed me while I was in Yuma county detention center back in November last year. Had all the time to do so.
We all want Joe Biden as a leader.  As Biden said, you are Putin's Puppy.
I'm a Biden supporter and I  support law enforcement.   Everyday!

President Trump.  You need to be calm at debates.  Ask Biden about national mask mandate if he wins??
And Biden called ANTIFA an idea. These are the people burning cities every night
Biden called Antifa a idea.  That‚Äôs a lie but you don‚Äôt bring that up
Trump won. Biden was led by both fear and anger. Trump is getting stuff done and has actual proof. I have seen it. Biden is a shell of the man he once was.
#PresidentTrump was not wired nor did he use an #IPad and what‚Äôs that thing inside #Biden‚Äôs left cuff - #Fishy
What‚Äôs in #Biden‚Äôs left üëÄ hand ‚Äî his pen is in his right hand ‚Äî

We need an explanation about the wire sticking out of #Biden‚Äôs jacket ‚Äî #Biden stuck his hand inside his jacket when he withdrew his hand the wire popped out - #Biden tried to tuck the wire back in ‚Äîplease explain üëâ  üòÇüòÇ

Biden skipped $100,000‚Äôs in payroll taxes.  Why don‚Äôt you talk about that?
trump when he didn‚Äôt listen to biden
It was hard to watch Chris Wallace take no control... Trump was a bully , didnt change our Vote Joe Biden for President!!!!!!!
I didnt hear none of that ... Joe Biden for President
If biden win's You guy's better be the 1st one's To give up to the Russian's
Megyn-you can't be so out of touch as to actually think this.  Why would Biden want to control Trump?  An out of control Trump is a prime reason why Joe Biden will be our next president.
Biden and it wasn't even close.  Trump was a total trainwreck.
Biden couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag...
On the other hand, Trump listed a whole lot of enemies to the state that lined Biden's families pockets and instead of condeming communists fessing up Biden just kept yelling "he's lying"
It was the biggest Clown ü§° show from Clown ü§° world, Chris Wallace and Biden for that matter is a joke
For Biden of course not for the racist orange clown killer.
So Biden get zero and Trump gets negative one so Biden wins. Or is that Biden starts with zero and then subtract Trumps negative one which means Biden gets one and Trump gets zero, a binary scoring system.  Hmm, Biden won either way.
I'm tempted to say Biden won the debate because he didn't die, which is way more than I expected of him.
Telling the president to shut up three times is definitely not presidential on Joe Biden‚Äôs part
Trump‚Äôs people got out ahead of that this morning, already alleging that Biden would want to cancel the last two.... so it‚Äôll be a victory for Trump if it happens.
Wallace needs to get off Biden‚Äôs dick
Chris Wallace babied Biden throughout the entire debate!
Why is Chris Wallace hand feeding Joe Biden? Has Fox News gone over to the Biden camp.!  Biden should be ale to think his answers and respond without coaxing from Wallace!
The people who were Pro Trump at the beginning will say he won. The people who hated Trump at the beginning will say Biden won. There‚Äôs no objectivity anymore. It‚Äôs all emotion.
POV: Joe Biden before he kills all the cows
Joe Biden needs a factory reset. His files are corrupt. #Debates2020
Biden‚Äôs meds are wearing off
Hahaha so true.  So wild that these are the only two to choose from.  But honestly if anyone thinks Biden should win over Trump then I‚Äôm confused big time

Biden really trying to play the minority card with that irish catholic line
A little late to the debate but Biden literally just threw sanders under the busüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump is not even answering the damn questions and keeps interrupting Biden. Wtf.
and the fact that when he told trump that he‚Äôs interrupted Biden more than Biden has him and he still can‚Äôt accept responsibility ü§£
I don't like Trump at all. But when he called Joe Biden a number 2 I cackled. #PresidentialDebate2020
Annnnd 45 just stopped his interrupting of Biden to make a poop joke. What a fucking infantile moron. "You're the number two." - The 45th President Of The United States.
The worst part os that the DNC chose......Biden......to change the tide.
I hate Biden‚Äôs teeth
lmaoooo i gasped when he came for biden

Make it sound like Biden speaks only the truth when just a few days ago he claimed to go to a school he never attended
I'm thinking its gonna be just like his rallies and pressers.  I hope Biden presses him hard.
In the debate tonight I want to see Biden overwhelmingly expose Trump's lies and failures.  Am I expecting too much?
Lisa.  A real transparency issue would be Joe &amp; Donald both take Official Drug test &amp; physical medical exams.   Why is the a Biden campaign So AGAINST that ?   Why Against a Ear piece listening device before going live on stage ????    Proof is in their accepting or Denying too.
If this is a bet ... I'll give you 20 to 1 odds that Biden will be biden &amp; fu*k it up!!! Joe Biden will look ‚Äòpresidential as ever‚Äô at first debate, former DNC press secretary predicts
Is the mainstream media ( cnn, msnbc, abc, cbs ) going easy on Joe Biden? Study provides insight on how he's treated compared to Clinton, Trump..
Boy  Joe then you will have to LEAVE ALL THE TRUMP ORDERS IN PLACE THEN,  YOU CANCEL THEM YOU ARE ATTACKING THE 99% OF AMERICANS.  OH BTW  YOUR ADMIN IS THE  BERNIE /  HARRIS / BIDEN/ AOC ADMIN
Doing everyting possible INCLUDING  Wearing a EAR PIECE to get the Answers to Questions in tonights Debate.   Not his own comments but from Biden Team who will give Joe the answers to reply on ..   Phony Transparency.   Fact is he and Campaign WILL NOT allow a Ear piece Check !!
WHY IS THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AND JOE NOT WILLING TO ALLOW A SEARCH IN HIS EARS FOR  LISTENING DEVISE EAR PIECES THAT WILL TELL JOE WHAT TO SAY ??   WE SAW THE EAR PIECE IN THE CNN TOWNHALL MTG.  HE WORE A EAR PIECE AND HIS CAMPAIGN TOLD HIM WHAT TO SAY. !! NO TRANSPARENCY TO TRUTH !
I AGREE THERE IS " NO " WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION THAT KNOWS OR HAS REAL PROOF OF THIS CHINESE VIRUS SPREAD ALL OVER THE WORLD TO CREATE A PANDEMIC..  ONLY THEY &amp; THE BIDENS KNOW WHAT THE CHINESE ARMY DID IN CHEMICAL DISEASE WARFARE.   ASK HUNTER AND JOE BIDEN.
The Liberal Socialist Democratic Media ( CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS ) Won‚Äôt Let Biden Lose the Debate Against Trump.  They have their racing tires on to SPIN and SPIN and SPIN their opinions ..  Circle Spinning ..  All Smoke but no traction.
CNN,  YOU CAN TELL MR BIDEN IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS WEARING A EAR PIECE,  WE WILL GO LIVE ON THE STAGE AND TAKE IT OUT OF HIS EAR FOR ALL WHO ARE WATCHING WHAT HIS PHONY TRANSPARENCY OF ANSWERING ON HIS OWN IS NOT HIS REPLIES.   WE WORK FOR THE DOJ / NSA DIV.
How many foreign potentates is Biden beholden to?
Joe: Biden Campaign Requests For Breaks Every 30 Minutes During Debate..  NEEDS 30 MINUTE BREAKS BETWEEN THE DEBATE SESSIONS
UPDATE: Biden Campaign Agreed Earlier to Electronic Ear Inspection at Tonight‚Äôs Debate ‚Äî BUT NOW HAVE BACKED OUT OF AGREEMENT   !   NO tRANSPARENCY  NOW !!  JOE CAN'T ANSWER HIS OWN ASKED QUESTIONS WITH HIS ANSWERS..
Sen Coons,  Former VP Biden is a 47 yr. Politician that in all those years didn't do a darm thing for Black folks in USA,  even with Pres Obama, neither did good programs, investments and so much more for Blacks &amp; Minorities but PROMISE at Election time.   Promised NEVER KEPT !!
Bernie Sanders,  Dianne Feinstein, Elizabeth Warren,  AOC, &amp; Nancy Pelosi are really about besides being Hypocrits on Religion they say they are .. Cindy McCain will be the Dark memory in History books opposite her Husband.. Biden's future will go down as Deep State operatives.
Cindy McCain joins Joe Biden's presidential transition board If Joe wins Election and the Socialist Democrats start tearing down the US Constitution,  Mrs McCain will be remembered much differntly than her Husband John who fought against Socialism and Communism which is what

Maybe Zucker will make him a sweetheart deal to be a CNN contributor and he can spend 4 years calling in to rant about what Pres. Biden is doing wrong.
The president should bring a jammer to the stage. If Biden can have an ear piece, Trump should be able to block the signal
Tell it like it is. Go Bernie. Voting BLUE across the board. These tyrants have to go. BIDEN HARRIS 2020
Not just that but it‚Äôs becoming impossible to defend the lies. He has 2 options tonight:  1. Get so drugged up he can‚Äôt see straight and middle through 2. Be the loud, obnoxious hype machine we know him as and open himself up for Biden to counterpunch for 60 straight min.
Biden‚Äôs tax returns are posted on his website. Read &amp; you will discover.
It's Tuesday, September 29th 2020, and Joe Biden was the most corrupt Vice President in US history!
How many times will Biden put his foot in his mouth or forget what he's talking or tell the audience,  "Clap you bastards." lmao
Because Joe Biden is a failed corrupt candidate that can't even get through a written statement without a gaff and his campaign has alienated young progressive socialists for a few moderate votes he was going to get anyway.   "People stupid, Trump bad" analysis is week.
QUESTION: IF Joe Biden, did have something  haywire with his body, that would  take special medicine but kept this information to himself.Then got into office &amp; could not handle the job.Wouldn't it mean a revote? Basicly would have lied 4 the job.
Does that apply to all of the Biden family‚Äôs foreign financial entanglements?
OHIO SENATOR BROWN HASN'T SEEN ANY OF THE FACTS,  NYT THREW THIS STATEMENT OUT IN A PANIC TO TRY AND HELP OR DEFLECT FROM THE CORRUPTION OF JOE AND HUNTER BIDEN WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN..  NYT IF HAD TAX RETURNS WOULD PRODUCE THEM BUT THEY DON'T HAVE REAL FACTS.   LIES AND MSNBC
LIAR Biden says he went to Delaware State; school begs to differ.   JOE WAS THAT WHEN YOU  WERE WEARING A BLACK FACE  ??   YOU ARE A LIAR AND A HYPOCRIT !  YOUR SON AND YOU ARE BOTH CORRUPT WHO SOLD OUT TO THE CHINESE AND IRAN.
#Jill Biden has that same clingy possessive suffocating icky control of her husband  ‚Äî as does #MeaganMarkle
Joe didn‚Äôt fight those tax loopholes. He Used them as did Speaker Pelosi.    Fact checked on that.  Hunter Biden used them plus even did money laundering with 3 Foreign countries.
why did you LIE Joe. You never attended Delaware State College a ALL Black College when you started College &amp; YOU Joe Biden have never done anything to help FUND Black Colleges !  That‚Äôs A fact Check Joe ! Pres Trump has done more of that in the first 3 years in WH !
If Biden wins prepare for a worst Trump in 4 years.
Cindy McCain will advise Joe Biden's presidential transition team as it prepares for the former vice president to take office if he wins in November.

you Joe used the Tax loopholed in the USA tax system to avoid paying millions$$$$$ of dollars in Taxes.  Your Biden Cancer Foundation you raised has only based on facts checked given to Cancer a whole 12%  of the $6.5 Million. The rest you declared expenses per IRS ...
Just stop.  You have no clue.
I also support Biden for president, But before and after that I support people like you because I see and hear of your hardwork and kindness

Bombshell: Biden Knew Hunter Was Corrupt ‚Äî And Lied About It Yahoo Proves it
Two days before the presidential debates begin, President Donald Trump has mentioned again about the possibility of Joe Biden taking performance-enhancing drugs.
Two days before the presidential debates begin, President Donald Trump has mentioned again about the possibility of Joe Biden taking performance-enhancing drugs.
After the announcement of the new nominee for the Supreme Court, Joe Biden spoke against that decision inciting a plan made by the Republicans, he says, to "dismantle the Affordable Care Act."

It stinks when they endorse Biden!
Lindsey Graham talking about Biden....
All of the illegal acts that Biden‚Äôs son has done with SleepyJoes knowledge should disqualify Biden for  President.
insistence on drug testing Joe Biden leads me to believe that you have been taking performance drugs.  Why else would you believe that Biden has been using them?
Joe Biden is lost in space. Wants the President to withdraw Supreme Court nominee! He‚Äôs such a moron. Why would we want him as President?  He‚Äôs being used by dem party.
Elizabeth.   Americans are seeing just how Sleazy. You &amp; the new Socialist Communist Far left Radical Democratic Party  have gone  under the campaigns of You , Bernie , Harris Buttigic &amp; Now guiding Sick old feeble Joe Biden.  Joe is not Joe since he was VP w Obama.   He is ill
Dov, don't hold your breath. Joe the Nazi Biden can't even remember if he is awake or asleep!
Dan I would like to add to that by saying: It's Sunday September 27th, 2020 and Joe Biden was the most corrupt Vice President in US history!
That was the second part. So he jokes about how long he was in the senate but doesnt about his tenure as VP. When Biden screws up he makes it look like it was a joke. He has done this several time‚Äôs. Watch Biden of 4 years ago and compare him to what he is today. Somethings wrong
Trump talks to reporters every single day. Biden isn‚Äôt allow to talk to any reporters outside a scripted and controlled conference where he is told the questions in advanced. Want to know why? Outside of a teleprompter his age is showing. Watch videos of Biden from 8 years ago
Once again if Trump wins it's the Democratic party's fault for having Biden as their nominee
I guess the Debate might show or give some indication as to how his "Handlers" will work with him like they would have to do with heads of FORIEGN COUNTRIES. I can't believe the leaders of the greatest nation in the world, would allow this 2 go on. It makes Biden look terrible.
This is Ludacris, Joe Biden BEING POTUS. He can't even read, concentrat or talk right. One person  has the job &amp; only one can be in certain places to hold the job. Nobody can be with him all the time at certain meetings. Only POTUS can know secrets
When Biden wins and is sworn in on January 20th, he will be president no matter what Donald says.

JOY JOY,  you need to have the Tapes replayed of what Joe Biden,  Speaker Pelosi said back in Jan, Feb Mar, April &amp; May. ??  Just a New Flu Bug, Don't worry,  No issue.  Don't close the  Entry to USA from China .  President asked for $$$  Speaker &amp; Democrats said NO &amp; more.
Hunter Biden Report Bombshell: Joe Biden Was Briefed About Son, Caused Problems In Obama White House as report found released that had been denied by Joe.  Joe  so what do you have to say NOW about this ?   You were questioned by Congress under Oath and Denied knowing.
CNN &amp; MSNBC media people who we know hate &amp; lie &amp; taken you attacks could do the incitement of Major violence on Election night or day after.  Also could Kamala Harris who has stated  Harris / Biden or Violence will not Stop.
93% of protests are peaceful you‚Äôre only shown the 7% in what they call Biden‚Äôs America yet he‚Äôs not the president ü§Ø
The current occupant of the White House is not a good debater given his juvenile grasp of the issues.  His approach is to lie, deflect, and name call.  If VP Biden doesn‚Äôt fall for the okee doke and swing at pitches in the dirt, he should mop the floor with the wannabe dictator.
Yes and the John Durham Investigation &amp; criminal charges are coming to MSM lije You &amp; other Democrats &amp; Hillary &amp; Comey McCabe &amp; SoyGate Obama / Biden.
Yes Mr Joe Biden ... our Next President of The United States!!We all love Biden, he's the best man for the time. üíô
And if you mean to tell me that he wasn't doing that, then all it would have taken was a simple word from him to make them start wearing them. Even on debate night he was mocking Biden for wearing a mask.
President Trump has covid-19 and it looks like they can cure it Biden has dementia no cure
One reason is none of them get tested!! Biden was angry he was even asked and said no he doesn't get tested. Now conveniently he gets one to use against Trump like he suddenly cared.
Because people really don't care about real racism,  only selective when it supports their narrative.  They will literally let all the racist things Biden has done to hate Trump for all the good things because they are lifetime victims for Democrats.
You don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been called horrible names? Biden called him a clown at the debate. the  President of the United States, a clown. People need to stop and realize that Trump is not a politician, that‚Äôs what people love about him, and he gets things done!
Too bad Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt support the Green New Deal.
Yeah Obama did a great job. His district had the most black on black crime  gave Biden time to get his family tons of money
Wallace should have told Biden that it says on your website you DO support it??
Anything to suppress the vote my guy, and I don't even like Biden. A lot of them think COVID is a hoax, so they'll be going to die at the polls. Recently lost someone to COVID. We just picked up his ashes last week. I don't usually hate people, but I hate those people.
Also someone needs to ask Biden if he denounces Antifa and Black Lives Matter!!!
And Sen. Kamala Harris, D.-Calif. ‚Äî Biden‚Äôs vice-presidential running mate ‚Äî ¬†¬†followed in his footsteps in 2018 when she tried to smear now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh with similarly baseless and absurd allegations at Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.
Biden, now the Dem pres nominee, claims to work with Republicans. But his vicious conduct as a Dem senator from Delaware in the conf hearings for Robert Bork (whose nomination was not confirmed) and now-SCOTUS Clarence Thomas is a permanent stain on the Senate‚Äôs reputation.
Probably an outlier, I just don't see how that debated would help either of them. I'm sure Biden is still +7, however, I'll wait for more data before anything.
Quick Rant - I still feel like the fact the trump attacked Biden's son for battling addiction and when confronted with the death of Biden's other son said these heartfelt words, "I don't know him." What kind of shit human being do you have to be to say and do that? 1/2
That's why you should vote for Trump!  You literally just described Biden in your Tweet üò≥
Biden makes a ‚Äògaff‚Äô but if Trump is even sarcastic it‚Äôs a lie.   I think most of Trumps problems are he exaggerates or believes others. Politicians are just good at lying
Wallace should have reprimanded Biden last night for his nasty remarks.
Wallace should have reprimanded Biden last night for is nasty comments.
They rejected Hillary Clinton.  Not Biden
Biden will not raise taxes on those making $400000 or less.  Quit lying.
Thats hilarious if you think Trump was sweating . Biden calls him a clown tells him to shut up and refused to answer questions. He has no policies he wont say who his nominations would be but tells Trump to be transparent.  That was a complete shit show Chris was a joke
Dammit, at the next debate, either the moderator or Joe Biden need to ask trump to say the phrase Black Lives Matter. No let up, no copping out and say All Lives Matter. That would be sweet.
Are you serious? If Biden wins Harris will be President within 6 months. She is who they will be dealing with, not Biden.
How can you blame the man for his sons actions? Unless Biden told him to do whatever he did. Believe me I wish parents were held accountable for their grown children‚Äôs actions.
I heard even Melania is voting for Biden!!!
Sorry that‚Äôs not how it works. And Biden has yet to give me a reason to vote for him. He‚Äôs nothing more than a career politician out for power. And he‚Äôs a racist too.
Mr. President, since you were debating Chihuahua Wallace and demented Beijing Biden simultaneously, you did fine in the "debate".  We the People get it and stand with you no matter what.  Let God deliver you from this evil and we will MAGA!
Mr. President we love you, your better then what we saw last night. Next time, answer the questions and do not allow Biden to push buttons. Your record speaks for itself.
6/ Sometimes you got to tell some dirty bird man just shut the hell up I stand behind Joe Biden because he‚Äôs is taking on the worst our country is a mess we‚Äôre in a pandemic people are dying by the thousands people are unemployed people are hungry people are being evicted.7/
2/ kept insulting insulting Mr. Biden. I found it a palling mom she‚Äôs only 20 years old. I said yes honey it was wrong. I think a person reaches their point of I had enough. She said I agree with you Mom Joe Biden had reached his point of having enough. Mom? Yes honey?
Out of the 200K that have died from  COVID it is reported 97% had other morbidities. A cold or flu could have ‚Äòcaused‚Äô death. Biden was luring quite a bit.
Just got into a fight with my own father because he‚Äôs mad that Biden called Trump a clown I told my dad he is a clown he‚Äôs a liar a cheat and he divides people just like he‚Äôs dividing us tonight basically blocked my father.

Is it me or is  Chris Wallace helping Joe Biden and seems like he is trying to make President Trump look bad and wont let him finish. Man its so obviously corrupt when will the people actually get represented and helped the poor and middle-class need help.
So Biden, who  pays the salary for all the Govt new jobs ?
not once did u say how ur going to make our lives better. Not once ur plan to save us from Covid. Not once how ur going to bring us together to make our country less decisive no plan for new jobs. All you did was try to insult Joe Biden son. You have no plan.
Biden didn‚Äôt say anything bad about soldiers, he defended them
Biden responded that his son was addicted but he beat it and was a stronger person after.
Trump repeated the same fake garbage about Biden‚Äôs son, and in response Biden raised his voice and screamed that his son was a war hero, and called out Trump‚Äôs comments about how soldiers are losers.
Biden made sure to take his  this morning
Biden. "He wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn."    BOOM...
Biden doesn't even know where he is right now its past his bedtime!
Because Biden doesn't have any policies so he doesn't answer anything. Only policies he has is Trumps that have already been done! He is corrupt along with his son!

Tonight as I talk to Joe Biden through his earpiece I‚Äôm going to tell him stay calm stay focused and you can do it rip him through the heart of the matter. You got this am riddin with Biden.
Biden observers can't go into the polling location and look around either. Just more hypocrisy from the trump campaign.
Am voting for Biden no matter what Ratliff or Lindsey say or do
Biden is the presidential candidate I don‚Äôt care what Radcliffe whom is a trump flunky says today or any day at this point he is part of the Trump lying campaign
Not happy about it. But if it pulls whatever republicans off the fence to vote for Biden then, I'm okay with it.
please Mr President tonight focus on the American people don‚Äôt let Biden get to you also when he brings up your taxes tell him you were just following the laws the democrats put into place üëçüèª good luck tonight make American great again 2020
Hey doofus  When was the last time Biden charged the American taxpayer $75,000+ for haircuts? When was the last time Biden charged American donors to defend him with expensive lawyers? When was the last time Biden overcharged campaigns for hotel uses? #crookedconTrump
Every time Biden stutters, you take a shot. You‚Äôll be drunk in half an hour.
Biden is incapable of making a coherent sentence. And he would trip in front of the podium.
CNN CBS ABC NBC and the rest of the fake news I‚Äôve already declared Biden a winner
Trump and Biden really the best options we got???
Biden should quarantine for 2 weeks.
When can we see Joe Biden medical records
It‚Äôs OVER he needs to Resign. There is no way he is getting out of this enough is enough. Hello my future president Joe Biden could u start ASAP as a nurse I need the covid taken serious thank you. Every single nurse doctor healthcare provider.
Wouldnt be surprised if Trump announces today that he wont debate Biden unless he takes a drug test.
Today let me make something clear for others here on twitter. Why? Is the President says demecrats are cheating if Biden wins? Questioning voter fraud? This is his big push to divide us all more. Not to trust our electoral process?
These aren‚Äôt gaffes and you know it. I don‚Äôt know how anyone can support this poor man (Biden) with a straight face.  It‚Äôs quite sad.
As a Republican am voting for Joe Biden he did not kill 200,000 plus of my fellow Americans. 40 days until freedom and then you all can stand in line as ur put before courts and convicted for conspiracy against the United States of America for treason against our democracy
Again you both know you can not use an executive order to change a law passed by Congress. All your lies is why am voting Mark Kelly and Biden
I don't think people understand my POV.. I won't be voting for anyone. I don't believe in either. I despise Trump and I don't like Biden. I'm not going to try to convince people not to vote for Biden, but I will not. I'm entitled to not vote for either of them.
Remember when "We are not endorsing   was trending? It's getting closer and closer to change those minds and it doesn't look good for November. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #Biden #BernieSanders #CorruptDNC #BernieBros
Trump has spent the last four years claiming that he built a great economy that he actually inherited from Obama-Biden.  Now he wants to claim he created the provisions in the Obama-Biden ACA.  His bs never ends.1. Biden himself admitted taxes will raise 2. There is a difference between knowing how to take advantage of the tax codes obama implemented and cheating 3. Trump doesn't pay income tax because he has no income. He puts the money back into his businesses. It's completely legal
I will respect your commitment to health &amp; making good flicks. Your Biden choice is unsettling &amp; I believe you are thinking about which side of the bread is buttered for you. Congratulations you have lost a lowly deplorable as a fan.
Except trumps tax cuts have value. The point of them was to allow corporations to do more in country manufacturing, etc. Creating more jobs and higher wages, covid interrupted that. Also, what do you think will happen if biden wins? Taxes will skyrocket...for everyone
Are you serious?!! That is just about the most selfless act ever. God bless Joe Biden. #VoteBiden
No one from the Biden campaign should agree to be in the same room with a single person from the Trump campaign. They lie about everything. It isn‚Äôt safe.
And rump made fun of Biden for keeping a far distance.
Anyone that says they like The Racist Pedophile Biden is lying, he‚Äôs done absolutely nothing for 47 yrs.
Stop spreading your fear mongering lies of projection and deceit! And furthermore, WHO ARE YOU to determine whether Joe Biden should or should not debate any further!?  You imply he‚Äôs not able to make decisions on his own! STFU!
‚ÄúYou stupid bastards‚Äù a Joe Biden doozy.
I'm so upset about the Commission on Presidential Debates not holding Trump to the agreed upon rules! It's unconscionable they failed to test him prior to the debate, endangering Biden, bc DT &amp; his clan arrived late &amp; then they didn't enforce the mask mandate for Trump's side!?!?
And if he does did you go to jail simple as that far as I'm concerned him and his family to be arrested for attempted murder on Biden
Nope I got nothing! All Biden has ever done was create roadblocks, more taxes and hate
Biden had 47 years to do this, not to mention from 2008-2016
It‚Äôs not paranoia when no 1 can get their story straight. not even the doctors.  He still got Biden to remove his adds, gets to skip the debates, gets to avoid malaria‚Äôs hate recording AND can say it‚Äôs not bad.I REALLY hope I‚Äôm wrong. I would be much happier if he actually has it
Not true. Biden's fans were on the opposite side of the audience...wearing masks!
President Trump has done more in four years then Joe Biden did in 47! Biden is just like every other politician, a liar and a crook!Trump for President AGAIN!!!
Vice President Pence will campaign in Arizona on Thursday, the day after the VP debate with Sen. Harris.   Biden and Harris will also be campaigning in Arizona on Thursday.
When you don‚Äôt adhere to the science this is what can happen. I guess Biden spending time in his basement wasn‚Äôt such a bad idea after all!
This whole thing was made up so he can get away with not doing anymore debates, get off the topic of malanias hate recordings, and come out in 2 weeks and say the virus is nothing to worry about. And he got Biden to remove all his adds. You‚Äôre right I think it‚Äôs BS.
We need to elect a vigorous, healthy person as President of the United States. Compare Joe Biden on his bike with the overweight (6 ft, 244 pounds) Donald Trump riding his Golf cart. That's especially true after his Covid19 diagnosis
Trump/Pence have worked harder on behalf of the American people that Obama/Biden ever did. They were too busy corrupting America‚Äôs institutions and enriching themselves.
President Trump never said he was going to.  Joe Biden, however, did say he would pull his negative ads, but he did not.
Trump paid little in taxes because politicians like Biden wrote the tax code.
Oh my blood pressure went way up when I read this but the best part is Biden never faltered
He's on oxygen and he's exhausted he can't breathe somebody yesterday a doctor on here said that when you're winded you can't even hold up a phone they're lying I think he has a virus days before they said he did and he tried to infect Biden at the debate
Not a suicide manslaughter but then he needs to go to jail for trying to kill Biden with the virus because that was all pre-planned and we know that now
Yes I saw the sweating in the cottonmouth I thought it was from all the drugs which again such an addict on top of everything I think he purposely went to infect Biden no doubt in my mind
Neither'll listen though; even if Biden is better than Trump, if you seriously think we're going to get meaningful change from a neoliberal blue dog like him then you're mistaken.
I'm just confused why he hasn't been indicted already on the 205,000 dead but yes this was premeditated and it was against Biden that should be capital murder land it conspiracies about it
Remember that midnight flight him in the wifey took maybe they got some blood transfusions or something to keep them going so they could infect the debate that's all I can think of they wanted to get Biden sick
And it would have tried to infect Biden again or Harris or any of us
Yes in Arizona - same as Biden and Kamala  As an Arizonan - we‚Äôre doomed (again) by this jackassery
All my prayers go to the families for dealing with that one extra or maybe two extra seats at their table when Biden said that I burst into tears girl it's the worst feeling ever and me and you know how it feels how could they not
Show us where Biden has dementia. I don‚Äôt want to hear from right wing rags or trumps accusations, I want actual proof.
You know didn't we say that that Biden should stay safe and they use the Honor Code system at the debate Are you seriously kidding me and they purposely took their masks off to try to infect Biden
Biden is ill, how so?? She‚Äôs a doctor of education.
Of course they did. He wanted so much to debate Biden that he came late and could not be tested.
No notice to Biden. WH  is one sick group
We all know Trump would be all over how weak Biden is IF he had the COVID. Please note: SCOTUS nomination... there are NO VALUES with
He can do more that way than Biden in person. At least he can finish a sentence and convey an idea. Biden not even sure where he is.
I just read an article the whole family at the debate refuse to follow any guidelines except Melania find that very interesting dot-dot. I truly believe they were trying to give Biden the virus on purpose
Biden steals the show with homerun amid bombshell news of Trump‚Äôs infection  via
No doubt, Trump would ridicule Biden as weak, just as he did Hillary Clinton, when she had pneumonia.
I know he'd make a commercial saying how weak Biden was and how he was lying about being sick because you know it's a hoax and that's how they were going to get more votes and the Sons would be high as a kite all over the news right now
Reminder: GOP put us into the Great Recession: Obama/Biden saved us even with GOP resistance
. In txt exchange w/Biden cmpgn wrkr, got this txt "I think it's time 2 address the racial, gender, &amp; income-based disparities across our laws &amp; policies" Sounds t like Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©¬†of French Rev which -&gt; Reign of Terror &amp; Napoleon
Biden isn't president you're still free
Trump is also positive with covid when Biden isn‚Äôt. Trump is also in the hospital when Biden isn‚Äôt. Dumbass republicans had to have their event where no one wore a mask and now look at the outcome. I don‚Äôt give a damn who‚Äôs tested daily.
Days ago, Trump attempted to make fun of Biden for wearing "The Biggest Masks."...  Irony: One happens to have Covid, the other doesn't. Guess those Yuge masks are working. üò∑ üò∑ üò∑
Simple as this. How about trump shows up when he‚Äôs supposed to so he can get tested? Trump is a buffoon, a con man, a narcissist and a pathological liar. He has no ‚Äúhonor‚Äù and if were Biden‚Äôs campaign I would‚Äôve told him to fuck off and get tested.
VP Joe Biden. No weapon turned against you will Succeed My Lord My God Will Silence Every Voice Raised To Accuse you these benefits are enjoyed by the Servants of the lord their vindication will came from me  I Lord , Have Spoken! This is the massage for You Joe Biden. God bless
He was mocking  VP Joe Biden and not only for wearing a üò∑ but try to humiliate him whit his Son ‚Äòs  Donald Trump Deserves everything that is happening to him he has put this nation In hell this very moment the American people are looking to a total LOOSER EVIL ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•ü§•.
If Biden said ‚Äúthe sky was falling‚Äù would you believe that too?
The virus infected ‚Äú7,000,000‚Äù people, not the president. CDC never claimed no one would get infected, look at the rest of the world.  Biden and Pelosi fought against the quarantine when the president tried to protect the country.
Walking my rottweiler atm. Seen this baddie probably 40ish running. She was rocking a Trump hat. We good üá∫üá∏üôè seen one neighbor with a Biden sign.
That‚Äôs actually such a good question because Joe Biden is a leader &amp; a good man &amp; is further demonstrating this by deciding to pull ads. His ads are truth. They expose truths. I personally feel no need to respond to trump‚Äôs Covid w/ compassion, but Joe is a leader &amp; a good man!
This kind of ¬´fact checking¬ª is actively harmful.  He called it a ¬´Democratic hoax¬ª     et al are committing journalistic malpractice and actively spreading disinformation and muddying the waters with a ¬´well akcuslly‚Ä¶!¬ª herr
Trump hasn't stopped his attack ads.  Why should Biden?
You know if Biden was sick they wouldn't
Between the two candidates Biden already is the gentleman. Do you honestly think Trump would postpone it was the other way around? Give me a break üôÑ
Biden is a gentleman but if the roles were reversed, I‚Äôd ask #WWTD ? Answers?
Well well well. Now Trump has the virus due to his ignorant and cavalier attitude toward the pandemic. He and his whole family refused to wear masks at the debate and now look. He made fun of Biden for wearing a mask. It‚Äôs hard to feel a lot of sympathy.
My. Joe Biden shows his respects and regards, yet you flap your mouth and do the opposite? It‚Äôs no wonder you failed to attain nominee for presidency twice. Go rest, Bernie.
Tell me again,  how Biden should suspend his campaign for 14 days, while the #Trump campaign refuses to remove negative ads, in kind, &amp; #Pence continues his previously scheduled campaign events.
And STILL there are idiot hyper-lefties on FB trashing Biden. Seriously, STFU, children. Just this once. Put out the dumpster fire before you start bitching about the firefighters using plastic utensils at the firehouse. #Priorities
no if ands or buts. We GOTTA VOTE BIDEN! #dontlettrumpbackin
And Biden attack ads Still running in Arizona against Trump even though he touts they  were pulled
Biden is so frail, he would never make it past COVID. I see the his obvious signs of dementia
Only Fox and Republicans would call for this. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault. He didn‚Äôt follow CDC guidelines. Biden did.
I would not be surprised.  Hicks tested positive on Thursday. On Wednesday he arrived late to the debate. It seems a convenient excuse not to submit to a test. If this is true, he didn't care if infected Biden.
I can't imagine telling a Biden volunteer that...
If we want a President Biden to restore the dignity of the Office of the President, then he needs to start now. Besides, we must get beyond thinking of political opponents as enemies. If we continue that, eventually they will be.
F/O why should he. He's stopping his negative ads toward trump. That enough. Joe Biden didn't make trump sick, trump did.
Trump catching the virus isn't Biden's fault. Fox News can take a flying leap.
Joe Biden is setting the tone for decency, once again. He‚Äôs modeling gracious behavior toward an adversary. The country needs this to heal.
But it also shows at Joe Biden is a very classy man and is a true leader
Ok well said Mr. Biden
This makes me even more enthusiastic for Biden for this moment. His focus on relationships. Bringing people together.
I keep thinking about Trump admonishing Biden: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever use the word ‚Äòsmart‚Äô with me.‚Äù
Biden is a bigger man than I, fuck trump and Cruella. Lie in state for America.
yet the Trump campaign continues to post fake videos of Biden
Once again, Dems always have to be the moral ones while Republicans can get away with saying/doing anything. Flip the scenario and see how they would have talked if Biden had COVID.
Lol you guys. This is the liberal ‚Äúfriend‚Äù I tried to make amends with last month. She got mad about me playing Biden bingo ü•¥ü§£ü§£
don't know what debate you were watching but Biden got put away like dirty socks
oh I could see smirks on all those trumpster women faces when they took off their masks because they all knew they had and they were trying to get Biden sick they all make me sick
Hiden with Biden.
NO FREAKIN WAY.  DO you think tRump would stop his if the roles were reversed? I REALLY don't think so.    I don't think BIDEN should have removed ALL his Negative ads!     You can bet that tRump would have used Biden's being sick with COVID all day and night.  So,  NO WAY
Biden a ped
Thank you and yes put some leashes on your bitches or at least some masks stop trying to infect everybody I bet you're real pissed off you didn't get Biden sick
Nah lol. Foh with that Michelle Obama ‚Äú when they go low we go high ‚Äú bullshit lol. They would be hammering the fuck out of Biden being ill
Too bad Biden reportedly pulled all of his negative ads due to Trump being sick. From your behavior, we can see how the  would act if things were switched. You really are a bunch of reprehensible people.
Needs to just put a commercial that says Joe Biden wore a mask and does not have the virus Joe is smart and be like Joe
Sidebar: Joe Biden is a Scorpio.
Yes forget about it ships sailed no tears for this son of a bitch I've been crying for so long and I'm saving them also he did not remove one shity commercial and Joe Biden dead and I told VP Biden and put them back up all's fair in Love and War my friend
sometimes sir you got to get down and dirty and this is one of them their times
Cardboard cutout: while watching the Padres playoff game at Petco, one of the cardboard fans was Joe Biden.  Seems About right.
Biden is not running negative ads. However, Trump is still running negative ads in AZ. I just saw one with flagrant lies about Biden.
Joe Biden just proved that he is a caring honest man. Because of #45 is not well (???) he has cancelled ALL disparaging political ads about him.
You know what this is bullshit I'm going to send this to Biden and Harris we're not going to postpone anything
Only Biden not getting snippy
Obviously you've been missing all the things going on my friends they don't do anything right and all Biden is doing is virtual anyway why should he cancel his campaign when he followed the rules sometimes it's just not fair my friend and this is one of them times
It took Obama/Biden 43 months to get unemployment under 8%. It took President  5 months to bring unemployment under 8%. Who do you want as your President the evidence is in everyone should be voting on November 3rd for  again he is fighting for u
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE BIDEN SAID INSHALLAH
He was shaking like a virgin on prom night. He interrupted Trump 77 times and Biden 15. What a tool
Unfortunately I think you're giving too high of hopes I feel like they're going to blame Biden or us Democrats maybe in their hearts &amp; their minds &amp; their souls they'll know and be scared and hopefully secretly vote for Biden I wish they show him being sick so they could believe
Why should Biden reward Trump for being ignorant?
Sharing. Why is it you Joe Biden, you act human and say kind words to your opponent, but your supporters do not?
Trump has shown no concern for others health &amp; welfare. I have little sympathy for those who disregard protocols to protect themselves and others.  If this situation were reversed, Trump would double down to defeat Biden. #Biden is a descent man &amp; will always do the right thing.
If it were flipped, Trump and his cult would behave badly. I don‚Äôt think Biden should suspend his campaign.

Listening to Biden pretending like he gives a damn about American jobs while spending half a century shipping them overseas for personal profit is the most disgusting part of my day.
The Squad is speaking up now, trying to help Biden. The Democrats in Congress went wrong when they  let the Squad take over to completely go left to socialist.

We'll get to talk to President Biden about getting rid of these control freaks who have all this control on a freaking social media site
Clearly Biden is the smart one.
I just pray he lingers until the election. I want  Biden to run against Trump, not Pence.
With Patriots in control, this would be a beautiful time for President Trump to tout the effectiveness of HCQ against the virus &amp; for Biden to test Positive to show the world that masks &amp; social distancing is not a fool-proof answer to stop the virus! END the FEAR!!!!

Because holding rallies with thousands of people without masks wouldn‚Äôt cause it. Plus he didn‚Äôt even notify Biden‚Äôs team. It is what it is.
Do you not know the drug laws Biden has passed ? Like he has incarcerated more minorities than you can ever imagine!!!
It's too late? it was announced less than 10 hours ago. Kick his ass, Did you see those two clowns, bickering like small children. Trump was an idiot and Biden was an idiot. He has to have a microphone just like Trump. And there were no breaks that I saw. Did you see a break?

No! Trump knowingly knew the risks &amp; didn‚Äôt wear one, but Biden did.
We might be better off if he lingers in office until the election. That way Biden will run against Trump. That is better for us in my opinion than Biden running against Pence as Pence hasn‚Äôt personally pissed off as many people. So, for now, let us pray for President Donald Trump
Tbh if joe biden got it I'd be doing the same thing.
Since so many are asking, of course Biden shouldn't suspend his campaign. Trump wouldn't.
I think this situation only increases the chance of a Biden win. #Election2020
He better not suspend his Campaign,Trump still had all kinds of things going on while being tested &amp; exposed people so he doesn‚Äôt care about American people so as long as Biden is healthy I hope he campaigns until he can‚Äôt campaign no more which is hopefully after the election

Trump is the stupidest president  He cheated on SAT test for admission so his bought and paid for diploma is not valid just like his presidency. Trump has lower grades than Biden and a 95 IQ just like Al Capone
Weird how my family who are extreme trump supporter said Biden would be the one to ‚Äútest positive‚Äù for Covid during the debates.. but here we are.
What if this is a chess move to then have Biden test positive, drop out of the presidential election and nullify all the mass mailed ballots and stop the Dems from stealing the election?

His "lack of action" has nothing to do with protecting HM, going out for Biden would help us not hurt idk what your logic is.

Biden must denounce Marxist and violent BLM!!!
I don't like it that we have a racist pig trying to undermine the constitution by false claims of voter fraud as a President. I'll deal with it by voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden has very empty eyes, meaning his mental condition and possibly physical. He does not know the truth. Sad. Our President is the best and totally on top of all.

that‚Äôs funny.. that‚Äôs what I was thinking about Biden. After seeing the debate I completely do not understand how stupid you have to be to want Biden as your president
I agree with you on that one. The more Biden is allowed to talk, the more weak he seems.   Biden did interrupt Trump first though. Three times. But then Trump interrupted more. That was his biggest mistake.
Face it, if you can just turn around and vote for Biden, you never were behind a  true revolution!  The (D) is all that matters to you! ü•¥

If Trump was a white supremacist, Spencer wouldn‚Äôt endorse Biden.
Sorry, hypocrisy is relative. You‚Äôre right Biden said some inappropriate things. He did so after Trump continuously interrupted, degraded and even made fun of Biden‚Äôs sons addiction. Maybe rewatch and just focus on who said what and how often. Trump set the tone, made it a farce.

Lol, did anyone ever think he did support it?  Joe Biden is just a figurehead for the Democrats!  I'm sorry, I can't share in the delusion that Joe Biden is for the people!

True, true. Both candidates clearly had stuff they lied about In the debate. I‚Äôm just scared if Biden is elected, taxes will go up and you really think him and Kamala will defund the police? Appreciate your respect for discussing our opinions on this..
You mean like Biden answered packing the court or gettiNG tid if the filibuster? Or how about him not denouncing BLM &amp; Antifa?
But the point you make of Biden being the better candidate, that‚Äôs true but in all honesty, none of them should be in office
Will biden denounce black lives matter and Antifa for all the assaults, murder, propert damage in the billions. These are his base.
Now this is interesting to discuss because when the moderator asked trump if he condemned white supremacy he said ‚Äúsure‚Äù and then he asked them to name a group. One of the videos picked up someone or Biden over all the ruckus say ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù and that‚Äôs when he made that comment

How about fair moderation first, then Trump won‚Äôt have to point out Biden not answering questions. Wallace was like a referee trying to keep Biden on his feet.
It is extremely clear Joe Biden has no clue who ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù are, that how they told him to deflect anything regarding Antifa. It‚Äôs interesting that they pick Proud Boys denouncing as the Trump Bash Topic of the Week- Riots and Looting and Fires and Shooting-proud boys? ü§î

Sorry America, I can't make the entire video more serious, because to me Joe Biden is a joke, and his refusal to answer questions because that answer will become an issue or a headline is a cop out. He's a coward and RED CHINA is using him as a PAWN in their plan to dominate us

Arizona was key to Trump‚Äôs electoral college win in 2016. The president and his surrogates have been spending a lot of time here in this election cycle to try and prevent Arizona from slipping away to his opponent former Vice President Biden.
More likely they know Biden is just a figurehead for Nancy Pelosi to use as a puppet for her own evil wishes. We all fell for California‚Äôs peace and love hippy bs never realizing they were a liberal Trojan horse
You don't think Basement dweller Biden isn't "RACIST" üò°
‚ÄúSome Democrats apparently find it hard to understand how ruthless and dictatorial their communist Chinese business partners are‚Äù via    Marx Kelly is a PUPPET of China! Vote  for Senate. #LeadRight üá∫üá∏
And the US blames Trump for something that was beyond his control. Biden says he would handle it better...well hindsight is 50/50. My vote is with the man that has built our nation's economy back up after Obama/Biden failed.
These people have no scruples, they would absolutely lie under oath. Frankly who gives a damn? Either biden wins or we're fucked. We can return to this distracting bs after the election.
Let‚Äôs do this! Stay safe and well Vice President / soon to be President Biden!
The pot calling the kettle black. Biden is the one who needs to denounce white supremacy.
Now we just need Joe Biden to get the rona ü§£üò≠üíÄ
Did you all hear no one showed up in Nevada today for the Harris/Biden event to get out the vote??  Nevada is going red!  Sick of these DEMONrats like that Sissy Governor ruining the economy!
Stop speculating Chris Wallace tell the facts or don't talk at all. You instill fear in the American people as much as anybody else. Yet all you can do is talk crap about the President Trump. But go easy on Joe Biden and trust me there's plenty of to talk about. Fox News Now fake
... ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever use the word smart with me‚Äù üòÇüòÇ   üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£
Bro you are so far up Biden‚Äôs ass, no republican has ever said covid wasn‚Äôt real, it‚Äôs just not a dangerous disease, masks won‚Äôt do anything and there is no reason to shut down the economy or the country
would you believe me if I told you that I just got quite literally trapped in a 5 mile long Trump truck parade down the freeway (?) in my little hyundai elantra with a rainbow Biden sticker on my bumper.... you can imagine the gestures that were thrown my way!! This week dude...
Ok Biden you get my vote
This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.
And debated and could have potentially harmed Biden, biological warefare! TERRORIST!
Let‚Äôs remember to keep Biden and his campaign Top priority! #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #BidenHarris2020 #BidensUnitingUS
Because shitty people stick with shitty people. And Biden, Obama, Hillary, Harris offered their condolences right away.
Joe Biden is pulling his negative ads. The Trump campaign, of course, will do no such thing
Why your family does not do anything nice for people. Name calling, smears, lies, maybe if the Trumps were nicer it would help. Donny j. Trump has no empathy.  If it was Biden wonder what mean thing your daddy would say.
NYT (Maggie)cont: ‚ÄúAfter efforts to dismiss the disease as a threat...his(Trump) diagnosis confirmed with a NEON exclamation point!!!! the IMPOSSIBILITY of that GOAL!‚Äù My take on this is Trump‚Äôs judgment is BAD and Biden knew the only topic important was the VIRUS!ü¶†ü¶†ü¶†ü¶†ü¶†
Chris Wallace  why don't you have your own twitter account?  Hiding just like your new best friend Joe Biden.  I AM DONE WITH FOX - I WILL CHANGE THE CHANNEL IMMEDIATELY ANY TIME I SEE IT BROADCAST - INCLUDING LOCAL CHANNELS.  FIRE CHRIS WALLACE AND I MAY RETURN
Voters Believe Winner of Election Should Fill Court Vacancy, Poll Shows
Yea. You mean Biden.
I would not doubt that Trump tried to infect Joe Biden and his wife. Combined with his sense of invulnerability it seems entirely possible.
Let‚Äôs keep talking about Biden. He who shall not be named is soaking up the publicity.
This tells me Trump and possibly his family had it on Tuesday night, they refuse to wear masks, and they spread it to other people even possibly Joe Biden.
Trump wouldn't pause for a second if Biden were ill.
I've made jokes about Biden and dementia, don't get me wrong but I'm careful since it runs in my family. But yeah, I don't want anyone to die. I just try to be a good person, and go from there. I hope as a society we can get back to that you know?
Joe Biden has taken those CDC changes, incorporated them into his public behavior, and led people thru example. The hallmark of an effective leader.  Trump sneers at masks, in turn, encouraging his knuckle-dragging base to mimic his poor behavior. The hallmark of a shitty leader.
The Trump campaign said Friday that planned events in Arizona next week will be held virtually or postponed; Democratic challenger Joe Biden is expected to be in Arizona on Oct. 8. #phoenix‚Äã
For people who misreported.  For example the Trump Russia hoax which actually was the  Clinton/Biden Russia crimes that is just starting to come out
He is hated so vehemently by the left because he is slowly but surely exposing their unprecedented corruption - from Obama's weaponizing the FBI/DOJ to Biden's family raking in millions (even $1.5b in once case) from Russian/Ukraine/China leaders.
Biden voters literally have a mental disease
Trump's Supreme Court gambit could benefit Biden: Reuters/Ipsos poll  via
And my best friend, her daughter, and her husband all registered and are voting Biden. First time for all of them- and the husband was a Trump supporter...
I am nervous about Biden. The more news we get about how Trump and his staff handled this  ugh.
That one woman by the way was a Hillary person. Not Biden or Obama
That‚Äôs what class looks like Mr. Trump. Take notes now or from your hotel when Biden moves into the White House but please take notes!!
Plague?? I thought it was no big deal just the flu? Remember he made fun of Biden for wearing a mask lol.
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
And if Biden is planning any big gatherings in Arizona, he should be told the same thing.
Biden isn‚Äôt Hillary
Karma for going after Biden‚Äôs stutter. Hopefully you‚Äôll suffer
The man who tried to invoke Biden‚Äôs stuttering through cruelty earns him zero sympathy. Get the ventilator ready for the big man.
Hope you guys added Biden to list. Looking like he could very well have been exposed w Trumps avoiding pre debate test, # of debate workers now sick. Registered GOP, who will be unglued if Simon the Sorcerer (Trump) negligent attitude costs Biden.
Hi Dr. Biden, please implore Joe to put all of his ads, including the negative ads, back up and in rotation. All guns blazing. For the love of God and country.
Lol, get serious. Trump has been campaigning for four years. Biden has three years to go to catch up. Hypocrisy rules Republicans!
If the #publicoption were imposed on the #American public, everyone could lose their private healthcare plans. #MarkKellyforSenate
And didn't have the common courtesy to inform the Biden campaign despite being in close contact with them just a few short hours prior to his diagnosis.
The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Yah thats no issue. If Trump were to die Nov 4, then Pence just becomes the most lame duck lame duck of all time and keeps the seat warm until Biden.  The nightmare is if Trump dies before Nov 3 and somehow still wins. Then what?
Biden should put his negative ads back up, for the simple reason. Trump would do the same.
I think your anti-Trump paranoia is getting to you. How do you explain the 23 other people who also tested positive following the Rose Garden ceremony? And Biden didn't remove ALL his ads, only the negative ones.
#TrumpIsKillingUS Biden needs to keep ads airing AND media needs to get mad like Van Jones did after debate. Nice doesn‚Äôt work against this administration of small pox blanket givers. Get Mad. Enuf with nice. I‚Äôm MAD. GET MAD. #TrumpIsATraitor
Biden campaign drops negative ads after Trump tested positive
It‚Äôs time for Joe Biden and a United Democratic Party to promise that when given full control of Congress and the WH they will enact and deliver Medicare for All, in addition to covering medical expenses retroactively. 1/2
If he infected Biden he should be arrested for assault.
Beautiful morning showing support for Biden Harris 2020. #RidinWithBiden #StahlForAll #Yeson208
Biden says thousands of healthcare workers are being laid off... so which one is it?
Richard Spencer Reiterates Support for Biden, Disavows 'Useless' and 'Traitorous' GOP  #DNCPolicies
Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
(2) If Biden and DEMs admitted what Trump actually said and didn't make a major ongoing project of maliciously twisting it, but simply said they doubt Trump's sincerity in saying it, I could respect that.  That's NOT what they're doing.  This is about THEIR level of integrity.
just saw video of Boris Johnson sending well wishes to Trump, and he was wearing a "Build Back Better" hard hat. That was also on the equipment in the background. Biden stole their slogan from London!
After biden first said he wants the green new deal then he said he hated it and would never put it in place, yes, he did in fact lose the radical left...
Politics has taken over my life the past few months. It's been great and I can't wait for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to take their place in the White House, but...  I MISS HAVING A SOCIAL LIFE!!! üíÉ
Why does the media continue to cover Trump‚Äôs condition when all they can say is that they have no information? Please cover Biden all day and cut in with breaking news if they release anything concrete!  Dear Lord! How many times can they say they don‚Äôt know?
Literally you post an article about what Trump's company was accused of doing in 1973 when his father was still running it, and count that as more relevant than a smoking-gun video to a claim that DEMs are distorting Trump's words.  Almost as far back as Biden fighting Corn Pop!
just saw video of Boris Johnson on jobsite wearing a Build Back Better hard hat.  that was also on the equipment in the background. Biden Campaign stole slogan from London!
They announced he tested positive as soon as they received the results. Biden was in bed.
The Lincoln Project Releases the Pro Biden ad ‚ÄúHeartland‚Äù
Biden aides suspect that Trump had already contracted the virus by the time of Tuesday‚Äôs debate &amp; they are angry that members of Mr. Trump‚Äôs family refused to wear masks in the debate hall, and rebuffed the efforts of an employee of the CC to wear one.
If they had any self-respect, they‚Äôd go public, rescind their donations and re-direct them to Biden.
True even if Biden wins.
If by dying in this hospital bed, then yes you are correct. Joe Biden has never done that
Whoa: Did Joe Biden Falsely Smear the Truck Driver Involved in the Car Crash That Killed His First Wife and Daughter?
Reading all those left uninformed people really makes me cringe.  They have no clue what they want.  If Joe told them to go jump off a cliff they would.  Reading their comments saying Biden will/would do better is funny and scary because they actually believe the lies. #TRUMP2020
This January 20th, Joe Biden is going to be the 47th President, not the 46th.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
Even IF you were making a persuasive, objective argument that Trump has always been a racist (you aren't), you're still flagrantly moving goalposts on this. The issue is DEMs all the way up to Biden systematically, maliciously misrepresenting what Trump SAID; the video proves it.
‚ÄúStimulus‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt this just because they want adoring crowds? Then again, in my north-central-Phoenix neighborhood, Biden signs outnumber Trump signs 4 to 1.
Just like the Trump camp continues their Biden bashing with their commercials
Even if your Gish Gallop of unproven claims here proved Trump is a "RACIST", it is beside the point that DEMs all the way up to Biden are LYING about what Trump SAID. BTW, Trump "attacks" a lot of people of any color/gender; why not  too if he just hates black women?
I would be the first to say that Dem party overall needs to find commom cause with pro-life/anti-abortion folks.  Despite that, these pro-life evangelicals for Biden understand that soooooo much more is on the line this election.
(2) Again, my point was about the wholesale malicious distortion of what Trump SAID, going all the way up to Biden himself. If you want to ADMIT what he said but doubt he meant it, that's one thing. Repeatedly and deliberately distorting what he DID say is inexcusable.  Period.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
That debate should have been stopped because of that. If Biden gets sick, whoa Nellie. I think the country will become unglued. This selfish selfish selfish man has been COVIDs #1 supporter thru his handling and minimizing of this crisis.
Basement Biden is fine and will be in great health to lose this election. #Trump2020
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden is a much better man! A man of empathy is what this country needs to help us heal!!! I‚Äôm so proud to be voting for
Wow, just wow!  31 days until President-elect Biden is all can say to this.
You‚Äôre in for a really rough year buddy everything and believe is incorrect.  HRC &amp; Biden we‚Äôre in cahoots with Russia and, much worse, China.  It will all be exposed soon. #Trump2020
They are speaking the truth though. You know you'd be dancing on Biden's grave, we all know that.
This should highlight the main difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  States should be able to decide what is best for them.
About same troop levels, no major new wars, and failing coups.   My thought was where do we want our problems.  Home:Trump  Abroad:Democrats  Not voting for Trump or Biden but I still think it holds true and would rather have to face our problems here
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, didn't notify Biden (whom he shared an indoor debate stage with on Tuesday night), and continued onto a fundraiser and rally in Minnesota. On Thursday, he started an antibody therapy and went to a fundraiser in New Jersey.
The rope hangs empty awaiting conviction death sentence on Brotherhood Obama Biden and Hillary  genocide artists on Arab countries . Last report was 5 million Arabs murdered by their terrorists all for Israel Rothschild‚Äôs !

Biden has stopped his attack ads, so it‚Äôs up to me:   Trump seems like the kind of grandpa who gives his grandkids a handshake for their birthdays. Joe Biden probably buys them a trampoline. Fun Grandpa 2020!
Tough call, although I‚Äôve seen no fewer than three Republicans for Biden signs in Laura‚Äôs neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want us to get complacent
Did Chris Wallace wear a mask. No!!! Did he get a Covid 19 test before the debate. NO he arrived too late. You say " Follow The Science" Take your own damn advice Chris Biden I mean Wallace.
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
Expanded Hours! Our office is open today and Sunday, Oct. 3-4, from 9 to 4. Pick up yard signs (out of Biden/Harris) and please consider doing a no-contact lit drop for candidates. We're at: 290 S Alma School Rd, Suite 15, Chandler (please wearüò∑)
üëÄ Buried in the middle of this article: An Arizona NYT/Siena (A+) poll is underway. Friday polling (after Trump‚Äôs positive Covid disclosure) was beneficial to Biden. This will be a good nonpartisan quality poll result just before AZ ballots mailed on Wed.
Trump and his administration will effect everyone as long as he stays in power, we must vote him out and remove GOP too, vote vote biden harris
What would you know about unity? ‚ÄúDivide and conquer‚Äù were your words. As general Mattis pointed out, they were also the words used by the Nazis. Admit it: if Trump had given Covid to Joe Biden you‚Äôd be asking Biden to pull out of the race.
The Chauncey Gardner candidate.
While not quarantining, Biden generally displays very Covid-safe behavior and I'm sure he's doing even more now.  I trust his judgement that he won't be flippant about it.

Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Love you Joe Biden!  Go get em!
AND he was most dangerous as a spreader of COVID on TUESDAY. He figured he'd take a shot at killing Biden.
Paula-confusion the norm for Trump White House. Why would we expect something different? Looking üëÄforward to calm, truthful leadership w Biden admin. Sick of chaos/lies ü§¢.
We need a video on this..promptly!.No Mr.Nice Guy!!.he HOPED he could get Biden sick. DONT honor the devil.
And the Trumps arrived late to the debate and did not get tested. There wasn‚Äôt enough time. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that it was not purposeful. Prating the Biden‚Äôs are safe. Trump didn‚Äôt even call Biden to tell him he was positive!üò°üò°üò°
Honestly you are an idiot.  The President, your friend is in the hospital, possibly far sicker than his docs or the White House admits and you are tweeting about what wussies the Biden teams is.  The country is worried about the leader of the free world.  You?  Debates.
Dr. Biden was there, too. Can you imagine endangering not only  but  after their family has already lost so much? Just pure evil.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
Yes! Please look! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
Womp womp womp! When you have no legitimate argument, attack with analysis of the choice of words. Your boy Biden never gets the words right though you know what he ‚Äúmeans‚Äù right? Fine, he put his life of the line for the freedom of you and me...complete strangers!
Can‚Äôt think you would like to live in a government socialist country. With Biden and especially Harris you will be doing that.
He tried to kill Joe Biden.
Even Joe Biden at the debate, said a quick PRAYER to Trump, and Joe didn't know at 1st, hehehe. Take look at the paused 54th minute (My energy orientation is Right to Left= 54...45)  Joe uses a hand gesture known as the 221 Factor to symbolize God  Take a look &amp; see for yourself
No, Trump and the Radical Right are  trying to pull a fast one. The Radical Right won't have enough votes to put it through. With all the GOP senators (and more to come) becoming ill, no vote will take place until Pres Biden takes office and the Dems rule.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
I watched and it was Biden who interrupted 1st.
Trump himself was a biological weapon against Biden. Sick.
Trump purposely arrived "too late for covid19 check" and exposed many people including Biden etc
Because he is an Ardent Biden supporter and if you watch him he doesn't even pretend to remain neutral he is as biased as they come. Everyone knew he wouldn't be fair. Trump has to interrupt to point out all of the lies being spit out.
We will never know if and when Biden gets the virus since he‚Äôs permanently quarantined in his bunkers..we may have to trust his handlers - NOT!
Your husband mocked Biden‚Äôs son who has an addiction.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
I'd say that accusing Trump of attempted murder is just a little strong. Trump isn't that smart. Gross negligence, I can buy -- but a deliberate, specific attempt to kill Joe Biden? Dramatic much?
Because lockdowns just don‚Äôt work.  But that doesn‚Äôt stop Biden ‚Äú...I‚Äôll shutdown the country.‚Äù
Proof Alinski Marxist Democrat Operative Chris Wallace is promulgating fake news to help Biden during the debate
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely. More by
Oh, but we WILL vote for Biden!!
I‚Äôm just gonna say it: Biden needs to seriously consider quarantining himself. He‚Äôs done everything right so far; this is not the time for him to not follow public health guidelines.
He was positive Wednesday morning, yet never reached out to the Biden campaign to inform them. They were informed at the same time the rest of the world was: late Thursday night. He is a psychopath
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump knowingly exposed people to a deadly virus. In Minnesota and New Jersey. Biden better up the negative ads. Immediately.

if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
Honestly ,I feel like this is a play to first try and get rid of the president and Vice president which would immediately put Fancy Nancy as Acting President which open doors for Biden to win then after the first year Biden resigns ,which makes Kamala President and Nancy VPü§îü§îü§î
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
Bigly. Why should Biden stop his campaign? Trump did this to himself  &amp; literally infected people himself. He knew in Jan and Thursday morn.209k people are dead. He is a murderer. Whatever Joe Biden does, he will be doing it with a mask on. #TrumpHasCovid #VetsAgainstTrump
The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76.3 years and 81.1 years for females. Pelosi - 80 Bernie - 79 Biden - 77 Trump - 74  Why are we still voting people in that are likely to die soon?

CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Cuts Interview With Trump Spokesman After He Brings Up Biden‚Äôs Record On Racial Issues
My understanding is that Trump and Biden were supposed to be tested before the debate. But, Trump arrived late and he was not tested before the debate!!!
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
In Arizona, countless elected officials wished President Trump a speedy recovery Friday. The president‚Äôs campaign announced changes to his planned visits to the state next week. And some grumbled about the lack of safeguards at previous Trump rallies.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
Also promoting that Biden will win according to stocks buys and the GOP will lose the Senate. Resulting in higher taxes and much more regulation which will upset everything but that‚Äôs ok because it will all calm down in the long run. Geez.
#newsmax Quite a bit has been written about #chriswallace and his obvious anti-Trump bias exhibited during the Trump-Biden debate. But I haven't seen anything written about this exchange: Wallace asked #potus45 if he was willing to "condemn . . militia groups". &gt; &gt; &gt;
Of course he would.   He‚Äôs celebrated when Hillary Clinton had pneumonia. Vice President Biden has taken the highroad. If the situation were flipped there‚Äôs no road too low for Trump!!!
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Have you actually followed the policies he‚Äôs supported? He‚Äôs a terrible speaker and no clue how to use tone, but we all watched Biden blatantly lie and exaggerate to us during the debate over and over... but his tone of voice was consoling.
ü§£ Biden supporters are literally the scum of this planet.
Biden/Harris are visiting AZ this week sooooo this seems like a poorly planned attack
Nancy Pelosi  Chuck Schumer  Biden Muslim Brothers stop spreading lies fake rumors  all foreign countries except for  Iran wished  him wellness  .
Do you want humanity back? Work to get Joe Biden elected president. Maybe we can restore some of it.
I don't care about Trump. What was Biden's test result today??
Wallace promulgated false statements &amp; debunked fake news as fact, then stepped in to debate Trump on his false premise stories. He should have joined Biden, at his podium. Wallace exposes the disguise of previously fair &amp; balanced Fox News, now just more scripted leftist MSM.
Only of Tulsi, unfortunately.  Biden could almost literally eat babies for breakfast and be OK in their book just for Not Being Trump.
Trump knew he had it. He was hoping that Biden would get it. Evil at its best.
Hey Arizona ‚Äújournalists‚Äù, ask Mark Kelly about his position on guns and Biden‚Äôs tax hikes, in between sessions of rooting for our President to die, of course.  Just a thought. #DoYourJob
The current news cycle focused on Trump‚Äôs prognosis and the numbers of infected Republicans from last week‚Äôs super spreader events is the most effective negative ad Biden could hope for, and it‚Äôs costing him nothing.
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I am hoping President Biden does not go down the path of "leaning forward. Must heal the Nation." I agree with you. Put in place the team, investigate and prosecute all of those who broke the law.
AgreeüíØüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ. #BidenHarris need to keep moving FULL SPEED AHEAD! Stop being nice &amp; keep moving! tRUMp &amp; his people would taking advantage if it were #Biden that had #COVID19!
I hope he does, at least with him, we know what we‚Äôre up against and know we can beat him. I don‚Äôt want to lose all the Republicans for Biden.
Is he voting for Biden?
You seem a little angry there that I was able to so easily knock down the ‚ÄúJoe Biden gave the eulogy of the head of the KKK‚Äù lie.   A person should not be judged on what they once did but on what they currently consistently do and say.  has ALWAYS been a racist
1.  It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, it‚Äôs the Constitution, meaning 2.  Biden doesn‚Äôt have any power to delay the election, so 3.  Being a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù has nothing to do with anything.  If the situation was reversed, no way tRump delays the election.  He won‚Äôt even stop negative ads.

Democrats are liars and cheaters so naturally you would think that because all you have to compare it to is the most dishonest of human beings. I love all the polls about Biden being aheadü§£ just like killary was in 2016 right. DJT will be your president until 2024. ü§£ü§£ü§£
If Biden wins Florida, it‚Äôs done,
Biden oversaw the longest stretch of job growth in American history. Obama/Biden added more NEW jobs in their last 3 years than Trump did in his first 3. Then he crashed the economy and will leave office with fewer jobs than when he started. Get your facts straight.
Biden &amp; Harris also in Arizona on Thursday
I have no fucks to give to Trump, Biden needs to double down and destroy #IdiotInChief Trump. We need a leader in this country not a fucking self centered micro Dick motherfucker.
You coached Trump to scream at Joe Biden to rattle him. It didn‚Äôt work. #Karma
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
You really are not top of the gene pool with tweets like this. Did Trump also create the COVID cocktail in China and spread it to the world? He acted quicker than the WHO who told him not to overreact and shut down flights. As you Biden would say, c‚Äômon, man!
I often wonder where these people will go after 2020.   Trump won't hire them if he wins. Neither will Biden.   Are they hoping to wait for another GOP president in 2024 who might hire them, or are they done with Gov't service and are just YOLO-ing?
BIDEN SAID HE WILL FUND HAMAS!! BIDEN SAID NO MORE FUNDING TO EGYPT !! BBIDRN SAID HE WILL RAISE TAXES ! THINK WGEN GE FUNDS HAMAS HE IS PLANNING TO HO BACK TO ME TO KILL FOR #NWO HE HAS TO DEPOPULATE!
He is an orange treason weasel who somehow got COVID.
I could link a lot to you that would conflict with your conclusion, including his work with (and $ support for) Jesse Jackson.  But you aren't even interested in the evidence I've already offered, refuting a MAJOR Biden/DEM accusation about  Trump's "very fine people" statement.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering

Biden is a dirty low ball Democrat to take money from Rothschild just like Woodrow Wilson and many others to Vote Trump out ! Trump does not follow #NWO like Obama Biden Hillary ! So you want death stupid Democrats you vote for Biden there is a hell and God !
Do you know who the guy is holding Biden's hand Eddie? He fought against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was a longtime member of the KKK. You sure you want a guy who's buddies with someone like that as your president?
Just finished watching the DL; what a lyin‚Äô bigot  is! Both Biden and Trump equally responsible for the failed debate?
This is not Biden‚Äôs problem. trump wouldn‚Äôt suspend his.
Biden should ask for that test now.. You ready Lil Donnie?
I honestly regret voting for Hillary. She was so fucking bad that she still lost even tho many like myself held my nose. At least she said the right things. Biden can give two shits about my views ... So again, no thanks to any shit sandwich.
Well, I will take another 4 years of that since the policies are far better than the alternative socialist model we will get with Harris/Biden. Is that what you are advocating?
I no longer play along to this game that allowed Republicans and corporations to win for decades. Let Trump win. Dems can either whine like babies and blame voters or take responsibility for chosing shit candidates like Hillary and Biden. I think the former will happen.
Riots for dead felons Wishes death to President  Defends Joe Biden not taking drug test Demands to know minute details of President's COVID treatment.  #TrumpCOVID
Oh you silly silly son of a bitch   "In fact, Trump pronounced Democratic criticism of his pandemic response a hoax."
A hhh, no. Why should Biden pay for Trump being an idiot.
Trump campaign will keep posting negative adds about VP Biden. No class from Trump, none at all. Vote nov 3rd.
Hells NO ... There's NOTHING in the Constitution that would justify this. Trump gets no special treatment, ESPECIALLY since we ALL know he wouldn't do it for Biden. No way. Nice try, though.  #TrumpIsALoser
No problem. Just vote for Joe Biden.
Trump will win in a landslide as long as we get a fair vote. More Trump supporters line the roadway that Biden drives down to reach one of his rallies then attend. Biden isn‚Äôt just bad, he‚Äôs pathetic.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver

I know this is a year old but the fact that most people don‚Äôt really pay attention to it is interesting. You really think he has changed?
Sorry, I have to say that this graph could be misleading.  The aerosol particles may not drop to the floor due to gravity.  Think about the ventilation system that might have carried them to where Biden stood.  Any future debate events should be cancelled.
Chris Wallace spoon fed Biden answers and repulsed me with his Trump attacks! Can‚Äôt go through this again.
Only if Biden wins
VP Pence will be in #Arizona hosting a campaign event on Thursday - the same day as Biden and Harris - after the campaign said #POTUS won‚Äôt be at the rallies scheduled for Monday and Tuesday (and those are postponed/virtual)    #Election2020
Getting a little ahead of yourself there, or are you as delusional as Biden is? I guess his supporters don't fall far from the same tree.
The Party really wants him to lose to Biden.
Pray for Trump and vote for Biden.
USC tracking poll has Biden +3... was Biden +15 months ago...
Would Biden and his comrads be tested positive in a few days?  Betcha there were many dropplets flying both directions during the debate.

Hunter Biden Report Bombshell: Biden Was Briefed About Son, Caused Problems In Obama White House  your a scumbag

If Biden is a Christian I am an angel! What an evil man!
Bs! He wouldn't show grace for Biden or anyone--why should he get special treatment for his own stupidity?
Half full though of empty Biden talking points
needs to declare a war on covid. If Trump doesn‚Äôt die he will come back as the ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù and commit to fight covid. His ratings will  go up. Who cares if you already gave a plan Biden, do it again and make it sexy.
Biden‚Äôs promises are all great sounding lies for the ignorant masses!
White Supremacist Who Organized Charlottesville Race Riots Endorses Joe Biden
Biden quits aggressive election ads against President Trump üëç BUT Trump continues his anti Biden ads üò°.. Just shows who's the adult here in this election... Trump is truly a bad person.. so if his followers agree they are no better than he is
He shouldn't have done that, disagree strongly with him trying to show sympathy for Chump when Chump would absolutely NOT do the same back for Biden!
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.
The Bible tells us not to lie. You are not pro-life if you vote for Biden.
That's a crock of shit. The show must go on! Chump wouldn't stop the election for Joe Biden-- you can bet on that!
From  Why   can't expect to automatically get the Latino vote.
Read this thread, and then tell me how Democrats are not the party of hate.  Biden says he represents all people.  Don't believe it!
He absolutely should be on full court press. Biden should not suffer the foolish decisions of Trump.
If Biden wins you will be one of the first they come after. You just couldn‚Äôt wait until after the election
Trump chose to put himself and others at risk, adults understand they must face the consequences of their actions. Biden chose not to put himself/others at risk and Trump belittled him for this. Vote Biden/Harris.
Fact check: Trump campaign runs Facebook ads featuring fake image of Biden wearing earpiece
Pundits assume that because Trump has insulted Mexicans, Latinos are a sure vote for Biden. A recent survey of Arizona Latinos suggests otherwise.Are you fucking kidding me? Would Trump postpone if Biden was sick. Hell no. GFYS
40 homes in our community - three of us have Biden and Kelly signs....
So too therefore, Shouldn‚Äôt we have all of Biden‚Äôs health records too! Start calling for Biden to be tested for dementia. You have influence..
Bernie is campaigning for Biden HARD this weekend, has a ton of rallies scheduled. Biden is more of a "behind the scenes" candidate, wish he'd transition to being more visible.
And when your done, think of the more than 300k that died waiting to be seen by the VA while Biden was VP.
I want trump to get well so he can face justice after Biden wins the election.
As opposed to l Biden who was mentored by a grand wizard, pushed for segregation, and only significant bill in 47 years  locked up minorities for too long to make sure the ‚Äúpredators‚Äù didn‚Äôt create a ‚Äúracial jungle‚Äù? GTFO üòÇ
The problem is Biden &amp; the Democratic Party are just fine with this Justice pick. Republicans win &amp; Democrats don‚Äôt have to do anything about it. They can just blame Trump &amp; the Republicans while they spend the next 50 yrs fighting social justice wars all over again.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely.
Sorry.. voting Blue kills us ALL!  You don't let an OLD man, like Biden, who has DEMENTIA have his finger on the nuclear button!
Biden won the last debate though
No sympathy votes for Trump. Wish him well but vote Biden. EVEN if Pence is the nominee , vote Biden!!
I will vote Biden
"You should be more curious about Biden/Harris‚Äôs refusal to answer basic policy questions that will change this country forever"
It seems so probable that "Pompeo" and "pompous" come from the same root word, but I haven't found any verification of that.  Then again, it's interesting that the DNC is "Biden' its time" until its own version of Konstantin Chernenko drifts away and  Kamala takes over.  Names...
Bloomberg hoping Trump is "unable to govern" because of Covid, while wanting Biden elected, a man with DEMENTIA, who is unable to govern.  It's comical.
It‚Äôs easier to make voting change the system when we don‚Äôt have someone in charge who is actively trying to destroy our democracy. The plan should be to get trump out and bully Biden to the left.
I am voting for Biden and we will have humanity back! Its going to happen. üíô
Biden reminds me of an 80 yr old man trying to look young. The jog from behind the poster is a nice touch!
Before you fill your ballot out, think about how Trump lied about the dangers of this virus from the very beginning. Mocking others like Joe Biden for wearing masks.  Holding maskless rallies and W.H. events has endangered members of the GOP. #VoteHimOut2020
Every day we talk to hundreds of voters, and one thing is clear: we need elected leaders like Mark kelly and Joe Biden. In Arizona, there are 2 days left to register to vote, and voting begins in 4 days
Same here in AZ, we're afraid to see what would happen if we put out Biden signs. Several Trump signs on our street.
We were driving around Paradise Valley in AZ ( wealthiest in AZ) and 4 Biden signs for every dump signüá∫üá∏üëèüèΩ
Yes, Biden should run all his ads. Trump is running some of the biggest lie ads I've ever seen, here in AZ. I feel like we should kick his despicable ass while he's down.
Who knows maybe he‚Äôll make another Joe Biden blunders and really vote for Trump üòÇ
Just an opinion so I don't want people to take my tweets to serious. We would have to be there to know what is really going on but it just seems odd that's all. He usually is spouting out something nasty about Biden or Obama. So I will just continue to watch the news for updates.
1. Biden himself admitted taxes will raise 2. There is a difference between knowing how to take advantage of the tax codes obama implemented and cheating 3. Trump doesn't pay income tax because he has no income. He puts the money back into his businesses. It's completely legal
At least Biden supporters are practicing social distancing unlike the supporters of the other guy...
I will respect your commitment to health &amp; making good flicks. Your Biden choice is unsettling &amp; I believe you are thinking about which side of the bread is buttered for you. Congratulations you have lost a lowly deplorable as a fan.
In other words lets wait and see if Biden wins the election cause if he does then all of this will get swept back under the rug.
Except trumps tax cuts have value. The point of them was to allow corporations to do more in country manufacturing, etc. Creating more jobs and higher wages, covid interrupted that. Also, what do you think will happen if biden wins? Taxes will skyrocket...for everyone
Joe Biden Campaign Scrambles to Adjust to New Uncertainty in Race  via
Biden and his Wife tested negative for covid. Trump and his wife didn‚Äôt. So Trump is at a hospital with covid and his wife is home with hers. Sad
Neither is Biden unfortunately. All we can do is wait. Negative test results so close to possible exposure aren‚Äôt really diagnostic. He needs to be retested and if a week, 2 weeks from debate night he‚Äôs still negative then he‚Äôs probably ok. Pins and needles until then.
‚Ä¶and I'm demanding that Trump remove his negative ads about Biden
Are you serious?!! That is just about the most selfless act ever. God bless Joe Biden. #VoteBiden
Sorry America, I can't make the entire video more serious, because to me Joe Biden is a joke, and his refusal to answer questions because that answer will become an issue or a headline is a cop out. He's a coward and RED CHINA is using him as a PAWN in their plan to dominate us
I can do this too. A high level DEM source told me Joe Biden is stopping  his campaign because his mental capacity has become a serious concern.
This is the British Prime Minister wishing President Trump a speedy recovery. Notice the signs on the backhoe and his hard hat then notice the Biden Harris slogan. I wonder. Of course I believe that dark hill behind him is a pile of cow manure so there is that!!!
They weren't strokes, they were aneurysms.
No one from the Biden campaign should agree to be in the same room with a single person from the Trump campaign. They lie about everything. It isn‚Äôt safe.
You are blaming COVID on Trump?  Trump stopped travel from China is January and was called a "Xenophobe" by you leftists, Pelosi and Biden.  What say you about Pelosi inviting people in her district to parade in Feb?
Learn to read. It's going get worse when Biden is elected because the thugs are gonna be mad. Got it?
#Biden vs #Biden. Which side wins?
Imagine if we had an honest media.
Also, go look up some of the stuff Biden has said about people of color. You'll be mindblown
So vote Biden and Co in so we can enjoy more months of lockdowns and also socialism.
And this is why Biden must continue to show he is better. The racist are still energized

Yeah Biden evolved after he benefitted. Please don‚Äôt try selling that pig in a poke. It makes you look uneducated.
I think Biden is familiar with Laura Mercier.
And rump made fun of Biden for keeping a far distance.
Joe Biden said he decided to run when President Trump said inside both groups there's good people.  And if Joe doesn't understand what the President meant by that he doesn't qualify to take my order at McDonald's.
Immediately,  I want Biden impeached for all his notorious crimes.  But then Kamala would have the presidency.
25% have moved to Biden the terrorist!  I pray for it too it looks very grim now

Biden seems to observe the basic precautions about spreading the virus.
Well, because that's exactly what Biden wants to do and he's said it. Bernie Sanders has his hand up Joe Biden's rectum that he's telling him what to say and directing all of his movements.
If Biden wins, he may make us. That's who DemonCraps are.
How is Pence Not sick? I‚Äôm so worried about Biden!
Biden‚Äôs team should come back with updated ads that show Trump‚Äôs reckless behavior &amp; then his trip to the hospital. Trump can‚Äôt be trusted.
I‚Äôm in Arizona and negative ads against Biden/Harris are running full steam ahead.
Anyone that says they like The Racist Pedophile Biden is lying, he‚Äôs done absolutely nothing for 47 yrs.
Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt be reacting to Trump news. Biden and the Dems need to focus on their own race. As far as ads go, if they are true and accurate, why take them down?
The Biden‚Äôs are almost to the White House!!!üòÑüòÑüëçüòõ
Unless you know something that FBI Director Wray does not, Antifa, which stands for anti fascism, is an ideology, not an organization.   However, Biden, Harris, Schumer, &amp; Pelosi have repeatedly issued public statements condemning violence/violent protest of any kind by anyone.

It was Christie's strategy to scream over Biden while he was trying to speak. If you've ever heard him address the people of New Jersey, it's totally believable.
I guess Fox only wants Biden to suspend campaign.
I am a lifelong Dem and supporter of Biden, but I don‚Äôt know how we can complain about Qanon and then tweet something like this from ‚Äúa GOP source.‚Äù It‚Äôs irresponsible, IMHO.

The Republicans will be too busy jamming Corey Barrett on to the supreme court before they are defeated bigly Nov. 3.  So much for democracy.  Biden will have a tough time repairing the damage that has been done in the past four years.
Okay I didn‚Äôt think about it that way, I was thinking that he is not going to be able to do rally‚Äôs and stuff unlike Biden but I forgot technology runs 2020.

That just seems like peak 2020.  Pence takes over, the RNc announces that Trump‚Äôs electors will back Pence, and independents decide to vote for him over Biden because at least Pence isn‚Äôt senile...
So you will demand Biden‚Äôs cognitive tests results then?
If you can't vote this year just vote for Joe Biden in 2024.

This is what we‚Äôve all been wanting, a leader.  I‚Äôve had some harsh words to say about Biden, but the President should bring us together. We are broken, shattered, and need to find a common ground.  It may not be easy, but we are all Americans and need to start acting like it.

I would not doubt that Trump tried to infect Joe Biden and his wife. Combined with his sense of invulnerability it seems entirely possible.
Let‚Äôs keep talking about Biden. He who shall not be named is soaking up the publicity.
This tells me Trump and possibly his family had it on Tuesday night, they refuse to wear masks, and they spread it to other people even possibly Joe Biden.
Trump wouldn't pause for a second if Biden were ill.
I've made jokes about Biden and dementia, don't get me wrong but I'm careful since it runs in my family. But yeah, I don't want anyone to die. I just try to be a good person, and go from there. I hope as a society we can get back to that you know?
Joe Biden has taken those CDC changes, incorporated them into his public behavior, and led people thru example. The hallmark of an effective leader.  Trump sneers at masks, in turn, encouraging his knuckle-dragging base to mimic his poor behavior. The hallmark of a shitty leader.

It‚Äôs not paranoia when no 1 can get their story straight. not even the doctors.  He still got Biden to remove his adds, gets to skip the debates, gets to avoid malaria‚Äôs hate recording AND can say it‚Äôs not bad.I REALLY hope I‚Äôm wrong. I would be much happier if he actually has it
Plague?? I thought it was no big deal just the flu? Remember he made fun of Biden for wearing a mask lol.
Yep but it‚Äôs a whole lot less. He‚Äôs the most protected person in the world but couldn‚Äôt protect himself, his wife, or the people around him. Pathetic. Then mocks Biden for wearing a mask. What a tool.
And if Biden is planning any big gatherings in Arizona, he should be told the same thing.

The Great American Comeback already happened, when Obama/Biden launched the longest stretch of job growth in US history. More jobs were created in their last 3 years than in Trump's first 3--then he crashed the economy, &amp; will leave office with a negative jobs number.
Yah thats no issue. If Trump were to die Nov 4, then Pence just becomes the most lame duck lame duck of all time and keeps the seat warm until Biden.  The nightmare is if Trump dies before Nov 3 and somehow still wins. Then what?
Biden should put his negative ads back up, for the simple reason. Trump would do the same.
President Trump has done more in four years then Joe Biden did in 47! Biden is just like every other politician, a liar and a crook!Trump for President AGAIN!!!
Vice President Pence will campaign in Arizona on Thursday, the day after the VP debate with Sen. Harris.   Biden and Harris will also be campaigning in Arizona on Thursday.
I think your anti-Trump paranoia is getting to you. How do you explain the 23 other people who also tested positive following the Rose Garden ceremony? And Biden didn't remove ALL his ads, only the negative ones.
#TrumpIsKillingUS Biden needs to keep ads airing AND media needs to get mad like Van Jones did after debate. Nice doesn‚Äôt work against this administration of small pox blanket givers. Get Mad. Enuf with nice. I‚Äôm MAD. GET MAD. #TrumpIsATraitor
Biden campaign drops negative ads after Trump tested positive
It‚Äôs time for Joe Biden and a United Democratic Party to promise that when given full control of Congress and the WH they will enact and deliver Medicare for All, in addition to covering medical expenses retroactively. 1/2
If he infected Biden he should be arrested for assault.
Beautiful morning showing support for Biden Harris 2020. #RidinWithBiden #StahlForAll #Yeson208
Biden says thousands of healthcare workers are being laid off... so which one is it?
Richard Spencer Reiterates Support for Biden, Disavows 'Useless' and 'Traitorous' GOP  #DNCPolicies
Totally agree Trump would be doing it. But the media would be attacking him for it. And Biden was not wearing a mask at the debate.
When you don‚Äôt adhere to the science this is what can happen. I guess Biden spending time in his basement wasn‚Äôt such a bad idea after all!
This whole thing was made up so he can get away with not doing anymore debates, get off the topic of malanias hate recordings, and come out in 2 weeks and say the virus is nothing to worry about. And he got Biden to remove all his adds. You‚Äôre right I think it‚Äôs BS.
That liar biden denies that what he is saying in this video. And people want to vote for this socialist untruthful damn fool.
(2) If Biden and DEMs admitted what Trump actually said and didn't make a major ongoing project of maliciously twisting it, but simply said they doubt Trump's sincerity in saying it, I could respect that.  That's NOT what they're doing.  This is about THEIR level of integrity.
We need to elect a vigorous, healthy person as President of the United States. Compare Joe Biden on his bike with the overweight (6 ft, 244 pounds) Donald Trump riding his Golf cart. That's especially true after his Covid19 diagnosis
Trump/Pence have worked harder on behalf of the American people that Obama/Biden ever did. They were too busy corrupting America‚Äôs institutions and enriching themselves.
just saw video of Boris Johnson sending well wishes to Trump, and he was wearing a "Build Back Better" hard hat. That was also on the equipment in the background. Biden stole their slogan from London!
After biden first said he wants the green new deal then he said he hated it and would never put it in place, yes, he did in fact lose the radical left...
Politics has taken over my life the past few months. It's been great and I can't wait for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to take their place in the White House, but...  I MISS HAVING A SOCIAL LIFE!!! üíÉ
President Trump never said he was going to.  Joe Biden, however, did say he would pull his negative ads, but he did not.
Why does the media continue to cover Trump‚Äôs condition when all they can say is that they have no information? Please cover Biden all day and cut in with breaking news if they release anything concrete!  Dear Lord! How many times can they say they don‚Äôt know?
Literally you post an article about what Trump's company was accused of doing in 1973 when his father was still running it, and count that as more relevant than a smoking-gun video to a claim that DEMs are distorting Trump's words.  Almost as far back as Biden fighting Corn Pop!
just saw video of Boris Johnson on jobsite wearing a Build Back Better hard hat.  that was also on the equipment in the background. Biden Campaign stole slogan from London!
They announced he tested positive as soon as they received the results. Biden was in bed.
The Lincoln Project Releases the Pro Biden ad ‚ÄúHeartland‚Äù
Biden aides suspect that Trump had already contracted the virus by the time of Tuesday‚Äôs debate &amp; they are angry that members of Mr. Trump‚Äôs family refused to wear masks in the debate hall, and rebuffed the efforts of an employee of the CC to wear one.
If they had any self-respect, they‚Äôd go public, rescind their donations and re-direct them to Biden.
Actually, Biden had it and gave it to Trump.
True even if Biden wins.
If by dying in this hospital bed, then yes you are correct. Joe Biden has never done that
Whoa: Did Joe Biden Falsely Smear the Truck Driver Involved in the Car Crash That Killed His First Wife and Daughter?
Reading all those left uninformed people really makes me cringe.  They have no clue what they want.  If Joe told them to go jump off a cliff they would.  Reading their comments saying Biden will/would do better is funny and scary because they actually believe the lies. #TRUMP2020
This January 20th, Joe Biden is going to be the 47th President, not the 46th.
Our great country needs a new president that‚Äôs not a racist dictator. Please vote for Joe Biden..
Even IF you were making a persuasive, objective argument that Trump has always been a racist (you aren't), you're still flagrantly moving goalposts on this. The issue is DEMs all the way up to Biden systematically, maliciously misrepresenting what Trump SAID; the video proves it.
‚ÄúStimulus‚Äù is code for ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt this just because they want adoring crowds? Then again, in my north-central-Phoenix neighborhood, Biden signs outnumber Trump signs 4 to 1.
Trump paid little in taxes because politicians like Biden wrote the tax code.
Just like the Trump camp continues their Biden bashing with their commercials
Even if your Gish Gallop of unproven claims here proved Trump is a "RACIST", it is beside the point that DEMs all the way up to Biden are LYING about what Trump SAID. BTW, Trump "attacks" a lot of people of any color/gender; why not  too if he just hates black women?
I would be the first to say that Dem party overall needs to find commom cause with pro-life/anti-abortion folks.  Despite that, these pro-life evangelicals for Biden understand that soooooo much more is on the line this election.
(2) Again, my point was about the wholesale malicious distortion of what Trump SAID, going all the way up to Biden himself. If you want to ADMIT what he said but doubt he meant it, that's one thing. Repeatedly and deliberately distorting what he DID say is inexcusable.  Period.
(Just to clarify, I am anti-Trump *and* anti-Biden) Why does nobody care that Biden continues to campaign after being exposed to Trump? One negative test doesn‚Äôt meant he won‚Äôt become infectious. Shouldn‚Äôt he quarantine?
That debate should have been stopped because of that. If Biden gets sick, whoa Nellie. I think the country will become unglued. This selfish selfish selfish man has been COVIDs #1 supporter thru his handling and minimizing of this crisis.
Basement Biden is fine and will be in great health to lose this election. #Trump2020
That‚Äôs what class looks like! Take notes Mr. Trump and your blind base! Vote Blue! Biden/Harris 2020
Biden is a much better man! A man of empathy is what this country needs to help us heal!!! I‚Äôm so proud to be voting for
Oh my blood pressure went way up when I read this but the best part is Biden never faltered
Wow, just wow!  31 days until President-elect Biden is all can say to this.
You‚Äôre in for a really rough year buddy everything and believe is incorrect.  HRC &amp; Biden we‚Äôre in cahoots with Russia and, much worse, China.  It will all be exposed soon. #Trump2020
They are speaking the truth though. You know you'd be dancing on Biden's grave, we all know that.
This should highlight the main difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  States should be able to decide what is best for them.
About same troop levels, no major new wars, and failing coups.   My thought was where do we want our problems.  Home:Trump  Abroad:Democrats  Not voting for Trump or Biden but I still think it holds true and would rather have to face our problems here
He's on oxygen and he's exhausted he can't breathe somebody yesterday a doctor on here said that when you're winded you can't even hold up a phone they're lying I think he has a virus days before they said he did and he tried to infect Biden at the debate
He‚Äôs not fucking tweeting. Just  like they had Cain still tweeting after he was fucking Dead! I‚Äôm sick of this Evil Conman! I don‚Äôt care about him. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs real or a Con! We need to push for Biden hard and kick it up a notch while this Sicko plays his fucking Games!
Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, didn't notify Biden (whom he shared an indoor debate stage with on Tuesday night), and continued onto a fundraiser and rally in Minnesota. On Thursday, he started an antibody therapy and went to a fundraiser in New Jersey.
The rope hangs empty awaiting conviction death sentence on Brotherhood Obama Biden and Hillary  genocide artists on Arab countries . Last report was 5 million Arabs murdered by their terrorists all for Israel Rothschild‚Äôs !

Not a suicide manslaughter but then he needs to go to jail for trying to kill Biden with the virus because that was all pre-planned and we know that now

Biden has stopped his attack ads, so it‚Äôs up to me:   Trump seems like the kind of grandpa who gives his grandkids a handshake for their birthdays. Joe Biden probably buys them a trampoline. Fun Grandpa 2020!
Yes I saw the sweating in the cottonmouth I thought it was from all the drugs which again such an addict on top of everything I think he purposely went to infect Biden no doubt in my mind
Tough call, although I‚Äôve seen no fewer than three Republicans for Biden signs in Laura‚Äôs neighborhood. I don‚Äôt want us to get complacent
Did Chris Wallace wear a mask. No!!! Did he get a Covid 19 test before the debate. NO he arrived too late. You say " Follow The Science" Take your own damn advice Chris Biden I mean Wallace.
He only spoke to dozens though, Mike. And they bag on Biden not being able to draw a crowd...
Biden/Harris follow responsible guidelines. Pence works at the White House Covid Factory.  should ban his event.
Expanded Hours! Our office is open today and Sunday, Oct. 3-4, from 9 to 4. Pick up yard signs (out of Biden/Harris) and please consider doing a no-contact lit drop for candidates. We're at: 290 S Alma School Rd, Suite 15, Chandler (please wearüò∑)
üëÄ Buried in the middle of this article: An Arizona NYT/Siena (A+) poll is underway. Friday polling (after Trump‚Äôs positive Covid disclosure) was beneficial to Biden. This will be a good nonpartisan quality poll result just before AZ ballots mailed on Wed.
Trump and his administration will effect everyone as long as he stays in power, we must vote him out and remove GOP too, vote vote biden harris
What would you know about unity? ‚ÄúDivide and conquer‚Äù were your words. As general Mattis pointed out, they were also the words used by the Nazis. Admit it: if Trump had given Covid to Joe Biden you‚Äôd be asking Biden to pull out of the race.
The Chauncey Gardner candidate.
While not quarantining, Biden generally displays very Covid-safe behavior and I'm sure he's doing even more now.  I trust his judgement that he won't be flippant about it.

Listen to this episode of my podcast: E20: The First Presidential Debate - Trump vs Biden, My commentary and listeners' comments
Love you Joe Biden!  Go get em!
AND he was most dangerous as a spreader of COVID on TUESDAY. He figured he'd take a shot at killing Biden.
Paula-confusion the norm for Trump White House. Why would we expect something different? Looking üëÄforward to calm, truthful leadership w Biden admin. Sick of chaos/lies ü§¢.
We need a video on this..promptly!.No Mr.Nice Guy!!.he HOPED he could get Biden sick. DONT honor the devil.
And the Trumps arrived late to the debate and did not get tested. There wasn‚Äôt enough time. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that it was not purposeful. Prating the Biden‚Äôs are safe. Trump didn‚Äôt even call Biden to tell him he was positive!üò°üò°üò°
Neither'll listen though; even if Biden is better than Trump, if you seriously think we're going to get meaningful change from a neoliberal blue dog like him then you're mistaken.
Honestly you are an idiot.  The President, your friend is in the hospital, possibly far sicker than his docs or the White House admits and you are tweeting about what wussies the Biden teams is.  The country is worried about the leader of the free world.  You?  Debates.
I'm just confused why he hasn't been indicted already on the 205,000 dead but yes this was premeditated and it was against Biden that should be capital murder land it conspiracies about it
Dr. Biden was there, too. Can you imagine endangering not only  but  after their family has already lost so much? Just pure evil.
Trump is clearly seriously ill and should withdraw from the Presidential election. We cannot have a President who has a chronic illness from which he may never recover. The election should be between Pence and Biden.
Remember that midnight flight him in the wifey took maybe they got some blood transfusions or something to keep them going so they could infect the debate that's all I can think of they wanted to get Biden sick
This is about as silly as the ridiculous Biden had an earpiece nonsense.
Yes! Please look! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
Womp womp womp! When you have no legitimate argument, attack with analysis of the choice of words. Your boy Biden never gets the words right though you know what he ‚Äúmeans‚Äù right? Fine, he put his life of the line for the freedom of you and me...complete strangers!
And it would have tried to infect Biden again or Harris or any of us
Can‚Äôt think you would like to live in a government socialist country. With Biden and especially Harris you will be doing that.
He tried to kill Joe Biden.
Yes in Arizona - same as Biden and Kamala  As an Arizonan - we‚Äôre doomed (again) by this jackassery
Even Joe Biden at the debate, said a quick PRAYER to Trump, and Joe didn't know at 1st, hehehe. Take look at the paused 54th minute (My energy orientation is Right to Left= 54...45)  Joe uses a hand gesture known as the 221 Factor to symbolize God  Take a look &amp; see for yourself
No, Trump and the Radical Right are  trying to pull a fast one. The Radical Right won't have enough votes to put it through. With all the GOP senators (and more to come) becoming ill, no vote will take place until Pres Biden takes office and the Dems rule.
Would anyone appreciate a Joe Biden prostate commercial meme? I've got a few others I'm working on but found one that might work.
I watched and it was Biden who interrupted 1st.
Trump himself was a biological weapon against Biden. Sick.
Trump purposely arrived "too late for covid19 check" and exposed many people including Biden etc
Because he is an Ardent Biden supporter and if you watch him he doesn't even pretend to remain neutral he is as biased as they come. Everyone knew he wouldn't be fair. Trump has to interrupt to point out all of the lies being spit out.
All my prayers go to the families for dealing with that one extra or maybe two extra seats at their table when Biden said that I burst into tears girl it's the worst feeling ever and me and you know how it feels how could they not
We will never know if and when Biden gets the virus since he‚Äôs permanently quarantined in his bunkers..we may have to trust his handlers - NOT!
Your husband mocked Biden‚Äôs son who has an addiction.
Trump getting C19 is like the parable of the ant and the grasshopper. The Biden‚Äôs followed the CDC guidelines (thanks Dr Jill!) and the Trumps threw a party. If memory serves, the grasshopper dies. Aesop wasn‚Äôt fooling.
I'd say that accusing Trump of attempted murder is just a little strong. Trump isn't that smart. Gross negligence, I can buy -- but a deliberate, specific attempt to kill Joe Biden? Dramatic much?
Show us where Biden has dementia. I don‚Äôt want to hear from right wing rags or trumps accusations, I want actual proof.
You know didn't we say that that Biden should stay safe and they use the Honor Code system at the debate Are you seriously kidding me and they purposely took their masks off to try to infect Biden
Biden is ill, how so?? She‚Äôs a doctor of education.
Because lockdowns just don‚Äôt work.  But that doesn‚Äôt stop Biden ‚Äú...I‚Äôll shutdown the country.‚Äù
Proof Alinski Marxist Democrat Operative Chris Wallace is promulgating fake news to help Biden during the debate
If that's true, why were more new jobs created dyring the last 3 years of Obama/Biden than the first 3 years of Trump? Why did Obama start the longest stretch of job growth in US history? We know who the job killer is, and it's Trump.
The Trump campaign said Friday that all future campaign events ‚Äì including one planned Monday in Tucson and another in Flagstaff on Tuesday ‚Äì will be performed virtually or postponed indefinitely. More by
Oh, but we WILL vote for Biden!!
I‚Äôm just gonna say it: Biden needs to seriously consider quarantining himself. He‚Äôs done everything right so far; this is not the time for him to not follow public health guidelines.
He was positive Wednesday morning, yet never reached out to the Biden campaign to inform them. They were informed at the same time the rest of the world was: late Thursday night. He is a psychopath
You‚Äôll never see a confederate flag and a Biden flag together just saying...
Trump knowingly exposed people to a deadly virus. In Minnesota and New Jersey. Biden better up the negative ads. Immediately.
Trump Vs Biden Debate, Our Thoughts  via  #WalkAway #VoteRed #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat #WalkAwayFromDemocratsForever
if biden won, he would have these virus to welcome him. isnt that wonderful?
Honestly ,I feel like this is a play to first try and get rid of the president and Vice president which would immediately put Fancy Nancy as Acting President which open doors for Biden to win then after the first year Biden resigns ,which makes Kamala President and Nancy VPü§îü§îü§î
And did not let the Biden campaign know they had potentially been exposed.
Bigly. Why should Biden stop his campaign? Trump did this to himself  &amp; literally infected people himself. He knew in Jan and Thursday morn.209k people are dead. He is a murderer. Whatever Joe Biden does, he will be doing it with a mask on. #TrumpHasCovid #VetsAgainstTrump
Of course they did. He wanted so much to debate Biden that he came late and could not be tested.
The average life expectancy for a male in the US is 76.3 years and 81.1 years for females. Pelosi - 80 Bernie - 79 Biden - 77 Trump - 74  Why are we still voting people in that are likely to die soon?

CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper Cuts Interview With Trump Spokesman After He Brings Up Biden‚Äôs Record On Racial Issues
My understanding is that Trump and Biden were supposed to be tested before the debate. But, Trump arrived late and he was not tested before the debate!!!
But the Biden camp tweeted all the right words yesterday...  We need four more years of President Trump more than ever.
In Arizona, countless elected officials wished President Trump a speedy recovery Friday. The president‚Äôs campaign announced changes to his planned visits to the state next week. And some grumbled about the lack of safeguards at previous Trump rallies.
If Trump tested positive on Wed morning, he was positive at the debate (where he arrived "too late" to be tested before entry). Even if asymptomatic then, on Wed AM the Biden camp should've been informed of possible exposure.  bring those negative ads back.
Also promoting that Biden will win according to stocks buys and the GOP will lose the Senate. Resulting in higher taxes and much more regulation which will upset everything but that‚Äôs ok because it will all calm down in the long run. Geez.
#newsmax Quite a bit has been written about #chriswallace and his obvious anti-Trump bias exhibited during the Trump-Biden debate. But I haven't seen anything written about this exchange: Wallace asked #potus45 if he was willing to "condemn . . militia groups". &gt; &gt; &gt;
Of course he would.   He‚Äôs celebrated when Hillary Clinton had pneumonia. Vice President Biden has taken the highroad. If the situation were flipped there‚Äôs no road too low for Trump!!!
We were very concerned that Biden Harris name ID was low in our D +100000 precinct
Have you actually followed the policies he‚Äôs supported? He‚Äôs a terrible speaker and no clue how to use tone, but we all watched Biden blatantly lie and exaggerate to us during the debate over and over... but his tone of voice was consoling.
ü§£ Biden supporters are literally the scum of this planet.
Biden/Harris are visiting AZ this week sooooo this seems like a poorly planned attack
Nancy Pelosi  Chuck Schumer  Biden Muslim Brothers stop spreading lies fake rumors  all foreign countries except for  Iran wished  him wellness  .

We all know Trump would be all over how weak Biden is IF he had the COVID. Please note: SCOTUS nomination... there are NO VALUES with
Do you want humanity back? Work to get Joe Biden elected president. Maybe we can restore some of it.
I don't care about Trump. What was Biden's test result today??
Wallace promulgated false statements &amp; debunked fake news as fact, then stepped in to debate Trump on his false premise stories. He should have joined Biden, at his podium. Wallace exposes the disguise of previously fair &amp; balanced Fox News, now just more scripted leftist MSM.
Only of Tulsi, unfortunately.  Biden could almost literally eat babies for breakfast and be OK in their book just for Not Being Trump.
Trump knew he had it. He was hoping that Biden would get it. Evil at its best.
Hey Arizona ‚Äújournalists‚Äù, ask Mark Kelly about his position on guns and Biden‚Äôs tax hikes, in between sessions of rooting for our President to die, of course.  Just a thought. #DoYourJob
The current news cycle focused on Trump‚Äôs prognosis and the numbers of infected Republicans from last week‚Äôs super spreader events is the most effective negative ad Biden could hope for, and it‚Äôs costing him nothing.
President Trump has already won this election.  He would do a better job of running our country from a hospital bed than Biden would in top top health, which we know he‚Äôs not.
I am hoping President Biden does not go down the path of "leaning forward. Must heal the Nation." I agree with you. Put in place the team, investigate and prosecute all of those who broke the law.

I just read an article the whole family at the debate refuse to follow any guidelines except Melania find that very interesting dot-dot. I truly believe they were trying to give Biden the virus on purpose
I hope he does, at least with him, we know what we‚Äôre up against and know we can beat him. I don‚Äôt want to lose all the Republicans for Biden.
Is he voting for Biden?

1.  It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù, it‚Äôs the Constitution, meaning 2.  Biden doesn‚Äôt have any power to delay the election, so 3.  Being a ‚Äúgentleman‚Äù has nothing to do with anything.  If the situation was reversed, no way tRump delays the election.  He won‚Äôt even stop negative ads.

Biden &amp; Harris also in Arizona on Thursday
I have no fucks to give to Trump, Biden needs to double down and destroy #IdiotInChief Trump. We need a leader in this country not a fucking self centered micro Dick motherfucker.
No doubt, Trump would ridicule Biden as weak, just as he did Hillary Clinton, when she had pneumonia.
You coached Trump to scream at Joe Biden to rattle him. It didn‚Äôt work. #Karma
Thanks to  we now have a quickly escalating Biden Harris yard sign / other publicly displayed Biden Harris swag battle in our neighborhood. I think it‚Äôs safe to say Parada precinct will go blue yet again this year.
You really are not top of the gene pool with tweets like this. Did Trump also create the COVID cocktail in China and spread it to the world? He acted quicker than the WHO who told him not to overreact and shut down flights. As you Biden would say, c‚Äômon, man!
I often wonder where these people will go after 2020.   Trump won't hire them if he wins. Neither will Biden.   Are they hoping to wait for another GOP president in 2024 who might hire them, or are they done with Gov't service and are just YOLO-ing?
BIDEN SAID HE WILL FUND HAMAS!! BIDEN SAID NO MORE FUNDING TO EGYPT !! BBIDRN SAID HE WILL RAISE TAXES ! THINK WGEN GE FUNDS HAMAS HE IS PLANNING TO HO BACK TO ME TO KILL FOR #NWO HE HAS TO DEPOPULATE!
He is an orange treason weasel who somehow got COVID.
I could link a lot to you that would conflict with your conclusion, including his work with (and $ support for) Jesse Jackson.  But you aren't even interested in the evidence I've already offered, refuting a MAJOR Biden/DEM accusation about  Trump's "very fine people" statement.
. . . considering some of the biggest donors to the Democrat party are on Wall Street, I think their negative response has everything to do with Biden's evasive answers and poor performance. They love the swamp, the status quo and Joe is faltering
Biden is the¬†‚ÄúPresident Most Likely To Keep Me Alive‚Äù.  Answer to If Trump recovers from COVID-19 with no issues, won‚Äôt he be broadcasting to the whole nation that it‚Äôs not as big of an issue as it seems? by Sandy Patterson
I know he'd make a commercial saying how weak Biden was and how he was lying about being sick because you know it's a hoax and that's how they were going to get more votes and the Sons would be high as a kite all over the news right now
Biden is a dirty low ball Democrat to take money from Rothschild just like Woodrow Wilson and many others to Vote Trump out ! Trump does not follow #NWO like Obama Biden Hillary ! So you want death stupid Democrats you vote for Biden there is a hell and God !
Do you know who the guy is holding Biden's hand Eddie? He fought against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and was a longtime member of the KKK. You sure you want a guy who's buddies with someone like that as your president?
Just finished watching the DL; what a lyin‚Äô bigot  is! Both Biden and Trump equally responsible for the failed debate?
This is not Biden‚Äôs problem. trump wouldn‚Äôt suspend his.
Biden should ask for that test now.. You ready Lil Donnie?
I honestly regret voting for Hillary. She was so fucking bad that she still lost even tho many like myself held my nose. At least she said the right things. Biden can give two shits about my views ... So again, no thanks to any shit sandwich.
Well, I will take another 4 years of that since the policies are far better than the alternative socialist model we will get with Harris/Biden. Is that what you are advocating?
Reminder: GOP put us into the Great Recession: Obama/Biden saved us even with GOP resistance
I no longer play along to this game that allowed Republicans and corporations to win for decades. Let Trump win. Dems can either whine like babies and blame voters or take responsibility for chosing shit candidates like Hillary and Biden. I think the former will happen.

Trump will win in a landslide as long as we get a fair vote. More Trump supporters line the roadway that Biden drives down to reach one of his rallies then attend. Biden isn‚Äôt just bad, he‚Äôs pathetic.  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
I bet it is one of the same people who tried to debunk Biden wearing a wire during the debate! üòÇüòÇ
Just found a street in my neighborhood with 5 Biden signs and 0 Trump! My faith in Scottsdale is restored!
Simple as this. How about trump shows up when he‚Äôs supposed to so he can get tested? Trump is a buffoon, a con man, a narcissist and a pathological liar. He has no ‚Äúhonor‚Äù and if were Biden‚Äôs campaign I would‚Äôve told him to fuck off and get tested.

Sorry, I have to say that this graph could be misleading.  The aerosol particles may not drop to the floor due to gravity.  Think about the ventilation system that might have carried them to where Biden stood.  Any future debate events should be cancelled.

The thing that sucks is that I feel some people who do even more nice things for Trump then Biden is now. But at the same time trump would be gloating right now.
Getting a little ahead of yourself there, or are you as delusional as Biden is? I guess his supporters don't fall far from the same tree.

He shouldn't have done that, disagree strongly with him trying to show sympathy for Chump when Chump would absolutely NOT do the same back for Biden!
I got a few things to say.   1. Imagine what Trump would be tweeting is Biden contracted COVID 19 and was sent to the hospital.   If you think it would resemble any good will don‚Äôt kid yourself, stop it.
The Bible tells us not to lie. You are not pro-life if you vote for Biden.
That's a crock of shit. The show must go on! Chump wouldn't stop the election for Joe Biden-- you can bet on that!

The virus infected ‚Äú7,000,000‚Äù people, not the president. CDC never claimed no one would get infected, look at the rest of the world.  Biden and Pelosi fought against the quarantine when the president tried to protect the country.
He absolutely should be on full court press. Biden should not suffer the foolish decisions of Trump.
If Biden wins you will be one of the first they come after. You just couldn‚Äôt wait until after the election
Trump chose to put himself and others at risk, adults understand they must face the consequences of their actions. Biden chose not to put himself/others at risk and Trump belittled him for this. Vote Biden/Harris.

I would never wish anyone get COVID or sick- but do not think for a second that If the roles were reversed, that our President would be sympathetic or civil to Joe Biden. He‚Äôs mocked sick, disabled and more. He would NOT take the high ground on this.
He was the one that put together the report on Biden‚Äôs corruption. Suspicious? You betcha!!
The Trump-Biden Stakes: Your Life Savings
Vice President Biden &amp; Mrs. Biden you are so much above trump, that it's nice you can give empathy to him and his family. God Bless you and keep you healthy and safe. Pls don't go in harms way again, please.
think about all the ‚Äúquiet professionals‚Äù whose jobs and livelihoods have been sacrificed because Biden and Barry did nothing in 2013 when we had the flu epidemic. And Biden called trumps travel restriction from china ‚Äúracist and xenophobic‚Äù
The Chinese have Biden in their back pocket.
Lets see, #Trump-Russia was fully debunked, but #Biden-China appears to be factual. Hmmmmm. Yet the #Stupid still insist on believing in the former. Go figure?
It potentially benefits him. But this is too elaborate and risky to be a hoax. It actually hurts him politically also. He loves to tweet, and hold rallies. He loves to be in front of camera. He's a narcissist. No way he'd be okay hiding out while Biden campaigns.
Here is my question for  and  et al ... let‚Äôs say, for the sake of argument, that Trump is not the candidate for whatever reason.  Are you still for Biden or will you reward Pence, who has enabled and covered for all this bullshit?  Legit question.
This is why Trump most win! This freak should be in jail!!!!! Biden counter part supports this!
This is correct, media is prepaid. When you buy time online or TV you reserve space on that media. When you cancel you tend have a few days of pre paid media play out while those affiliates resell their ad space. But since this is a headline media only I guess Biden is lying.
A move that shows Biden‚Äôs character, but one, I‚Äôm afraid, that will be interpreted as weakness.
Biden won that debate!
Hey Don, I found this article about how good you are at covering things up, except your mouth of course. #Mask #TrumpHasCovid #MAGA #COVID19 #COVIDIOTS #Biden
That‚Äôs actually such a good question because Joe Biden is a leader &amp; a good man &amp; is further demonstrating this by deciding to pull ads. His ads are truth. They expose truths. I personally feel no need to respond to trump‚Äôs Covid w/ compassion, but Joe is a leader &amp; a good man!
Corporation admits in court they
Gov. Christie spent four days indoors with an unmasked Trump team preparing for the debate. VP Biden spent 90 minutes on the debate stage with Trump. The WH didn't bother to contact either after Hicks tested positive. They both learned about the outbreak on social media.
Instead Trump catches the Wuhan and Biden  leaves the basement?  That‚Äôs weird : almost like a plan?
Does seem strange huh. Plus Biden didn't get it.
Why wouldn't they test negative for this virus Joe Biden has basically spent this entire campaign in his basement. I don't believe there's a Democrat out there that can tell you the Democratic party's agenda
Chris Wallace is an embarrassment to himself and Fox news. He overshot his self-importance by debating the president of the United States. He was polite and soft on Joe Biden and nasty and rude to my president
For 47 years Joe Biden has accomplished very little, AND THE VIOLENCE CONTINUES.   Thank you for sharing your opinions. I do respect your opinions; however, I do not agree with you. We will just ‚ÄúAgree to disagree‚Äù..
It's been over a year I said,  "under my Command, every Avenue North through Mexico would be annihilated, impassable"... As Biden said, "it's not gonna stop, they're just going to keep coming".
No ones demanding Biden suspend his campaign except maybe Pelosi &amp; other Dems bc they're worried his dumb ass will say something stupid.

Look what he has done for this Nation. The list is to long to mention.  Please look it up. Again put away your thoughts of the mans attitude, focus on what he has done.  Have you watched the video where Biden told Ukraine if they didn‚Äôt fire the prosecuting attorney ......cont.
So tRump has COVID now?!All these months of POTUS ridiculing us, down playing the virus, crowding in small areas, NO MASKS!   So I wonder if tRump was late to the debate on purpose knowingly knew he had COVID and wanted to give it BIDEN so he could laugh in Biden‚Äôs face #FDT MUW?
Uh, did Biden mention any plans to implement single-payer, universal healthcare coverage for ALL during his first 100 days in office in response to a disease that's claimed nearly a quarter-million lives? If not, shame on him!!!
I wonder why no law enforcement supports Biden?
Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room. He's always the news. In fact you rarely hear anything that Biden is doing while campaigning. I'm sick of this damn monster and want him gone!

Trump hasn't stopped his attack ads.  Why should Biden?
Why is biden acting like goku when he gave cell the senzu bean? Bruh, this is the perfect time to airing these anti ads! He's literally got the thing!

Have to believe Biden has an equal bot network. His campaign is dumb as dirt if they don't match fire with fire.

We know who Trump is.‚Äù  and we know who Joe Biden is he‚Äôs a man of integrity and respect. that will never change regardless of any racist evil man.‚Äù
Because Joe Biden is a decent,compassionate man and trump is trump.
There won't be any more debates. I can see the audience and Biden ruthlessly going after Trump for knowingly endangering everyone in the first debate.  He can't survive 90 minutes of that.
You know if Biden was sick they wouldn't
I agree, DO NOT delay the election! Trumpenfuehrer wouldn't, if it was Biden, who was sick! We need to keep going! Biden needs to take this time to double down, on his campaign efforts! We need to fight dirty! Gods know the GOP Cult is!
Another reason this is wrong move.  The very day the Biden campaign did this, the Trump campaign BEGAN running new negative ads against Biden on the Facebook platform .... more are certain to come
Suspicious indeed! That is how bad the Dems want to win, so they can stop all investigations of Biden &amp; Son, so they can dismiss Durham before he can release his report....
U literally complained that he didn‚Äôt stop for questions  Biden‚Äôs had maybe 5 press conferences, but u want Trump with COVID-19 to approach the press with a virus?   You‚Äôd then claim he tried to infect u   You‚Äôre the most incompetent ‚Äújournalist‚Äù ever  #JimAcosta  #Trump2020
She didn't say they should do it, only questioned whether they would? Love the picture of Biden wearing the biggest mask Trump has ever seen.
Biden is a moron, what's he gonna do? ü§™
Nope. CNN did report that Biden removed negative ads while Trump says he won't do the same.
So after attacking his son Hunter &amp; completely dismissing his deceased son Beau, STILL sent this Twt,wished Trump &amp; fam well while spkng in MI,&amp; pulls negative campaign ads.Biden TRULY is a classy,empathetic, genuine human being.While the other isn‚Äôt EVEN a human beingüò°

The right brags about not being politically correct and they also wished death on Biden. Saying he was going to die and Trump mocked his dead son and his other sons addiction. But you want me to feel sorry for any of you lmao
Then why do they allow armed idiots like Proud Boys to issue threats to anyone who voted for Biden?
And it gets him out of debates that he simply will never stand up strong against of Biden. And notice trump taxes is out if the headlines. His sinking campaign is the third
The Obama Admin did the same thing w the Bush Admin. Who's to say the Biden Admin wouldn't do the same thing for the Trump Admin? They will!
Hold up... You‚Äôre whining about mask advice given in May, and it‚Äôs Oct 2nd?  If you can remember way back to five days ago, Donald J Cunt was still making fun of Biden‚Äôs mask on sept 29th during the debate Can you honestly call that leadership?
He never said that. Smh geez take a simple statement make it a mountain.    Biden does grab lil girls with no boobs and growing ones. The freak
Biden is a responsible man who follows the advice of scientists. It‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs fault Trump is an irresponsible person who risks his life as well as the live of millions of Americans.
Who cares what Fox News  demands? Biden for President!
Very nice. Please ask her to pray for Joe Biden and his family, who the trump crew may have infected.

Going well? More than 200,000 dead because of your criminal, incompetent handling of this crisis, and you think it's going well? No. It will be going better, though, after Joe Biden is our President.
The thought of Biden in the presidency tho.. I hope that fuck ass predatory ass bitch die too ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
if i hear someone call biden a radical leftist one more time i SWEAR
And that's not happening. First of all, Biden doesn't determine when or whether the election goes forward. The House does. And the House has no reason whatsoever to postpone the election, especially since early voting has already started.
Literally boasted during the debate (if you can call it that) about how he wears a mask less then Biden
That‚Äôs not an ‚Äúattack‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a recall to reality.  Biden‚Äôs platitudes are noble but completely impossible given the reality of the party he leads.
The Trump campaign just sent out a fundraising email with the subject line "Lyin' Obama." The email goes on to mock Joe Biden for being "asleep in his basement." The Biden campaign, meanwhile, has pulled all negative ads.‚Äù

Hell no. Trump wouldn‚Äôt change the date for Biden or anyone else. The date is set for Nov 3rd.
Chris Wallace should never host another Trump/Biden debate! Wallace should go to work for CNN. And Donna Brazile was invited on Fox News after the debate?? She gave debate questions to Hillary..before that debate!! Fox News..are you crazy?!
Joe Biden is a pervert and has dementia. He will not be president. He is a shell of a man and was a horrible Senator and a crappy VP. GIVE IT UP JOE.
Biden is going to wear our his basement!!!!
I am still seeing the neg ads from Biden constantly in Arizona ABC, CBS, &amp; CW
Apparently it was Christie's idea to prevent Joe Biden from speaking. If you've ever watched him talking to the people of New Jersey, the idea is totally believable.
Right. Trump has denounced the White Supremacist and KKK in 2016. They are trying to make Proud Boys to be racist which they are not. But Biden gets a free pass. It is double standards.

Biden is the one doing the half quote.
These theories are so incredibly stupid.  It‚Äôs depressing to think that there are the same conspiratorial mindset folks on the left. I always thought they were few in number, but since last night, I acknowledge there is a low-calorie ‚ÄúQAnon Lite‚Äù in the Biden/Harris camp, too.

Biden‚Äôs campaign collapsing because his voter base gives Trump a sympathy vote is honestly pretty hilarious
republicans not wanting to pass the stimulus bill and Mnuchin's hullunation of V shape  recoveries is moving people to vote for Biden.
Well well well. Now Trump has the virus due to his ignorant and cavalier attitude toward the pandemic. He and his whole family refused to wear masks at the debate and now look. He made fun of Biden for wearing a mask. It‚Äôs hard to feel a lot of sympathy.
My. Joe Biden shows his respects and regards, yet you flap your mouth and do the opposite? It‚Äôs no wonder you failed to attain nominee for presidency twice. Go rest, Bernie.
It is a stupid suggestion. Biden took the virus seriously and took proper precautions. Nothing highlights that better than him being able to continue campaigning right now.
So you‚Äôre not voting for that racist biden either. Good for you!
And by the way, there‚Äôs absolutely no doubt it would be Dr. Jill Biden‚Äôs honor to prepare the People‚Äôs House for Christmas. Imagine having a real family there again.
I just don't see the same "we have to stop Pence" momentum working in Biden's favor as the "we have to stop Trump" momentum. AZ would almost certainly go back to a red state, as would a few others. So, these "new swing states" would evaporate. Idk, just my two cents.
Biden has my vote mainly due to the Trump plan to get rid of the funding source for Social Security/Disability/Medicare, which is all dad and I have keeping us alive and with a roof over our heads...Pence isn't likely to make that same cut. I'd still vote against Pence
and without the fear of Trump, many of us who will vote against Trump, may not feel the same urgency to vote against Pence (I would, He's a theocratic fascist as well), which leaves a lot of people at home instead of voting. Biden threw away any chance with the left other than
Honestly, I think the GOP would stand a better chance in November with Pence as their nominee. Normally, he wouldn't be able to win an election, but with Biden on the other side, Pence would take away any moderate Repub votes Biden has been fighting for...1/
Yeah, pretty close. But if Biden gets it a week before and is in the hospital on election day, that's about the worst case scenario.
Welp...Trump sure owned Joe Biden by mocking Joe's mask and choosing not to  wear one. Trump is infected &amp; sick with the Covid "hoax" virus.  Your health along with others well being is not something you gamble with, as he and his cronies are harshly finding out now.
Everything him and his sycophantic fanboys/girls made fun of Biden for especially that mask comment have come back to bite them in the ass in the most delightful of ways ü§£
They got it backwards; Biden would be the one sneaking up from behind
And increase his poll numbers by getting sympathy. Also helps get the horrible debate behavior he exhibited. It also got Biden to remove all the negative ads about Trump. If the rolls were reversed you know Trump wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
Yep. They specifically said they wanted Biden to win. I think they deliberately gave Trump the virus so he would back out if the election. But our president is a fighter and he will get through this and fight till the very end. Trump2020.
Because Hume is a human colostomy bag, and this BS ‚Äúscience‚Äù from the long-discredited AAPS is his attempt at damage control for mocking Joe Biden wearing a mask earlier during the pandemic.  Nonsense, but it plays well w/ the Fox News mouth-breather and geriatric demographics.
Pulling the neg. ads was brilliant. Nate Silver pointed out The press about that, and how it contrasts with the trump campaign is a bigger benefit to Biden‚Äôs campaign than the ads themselves could ever have been.
All his yelling at Biden was him trying to give it to him

Yeah read my original quoted tweet where he calls me a moron.   I asked him to admit he is wrong that NO WAY Biden does one debate.   Always a way have no idea last presidential election that didn't have at least one debate.
Just watched Chris Wallace on our local Fox news broadcast. They are really trying to rehab his reputation.  He says it was Trump fault, no, the questions were setup to help Biden. Nothing they can do will rehab Chris Wallace, in my mind.
Fight the good fight! Good things are coming Nov. 3rd! Biden 2020.
That Trump is being released from hospital because he never tested positive for Covid. It was staged to get people to forget his debate with Biden &amp; gain sympathy to gain in the polls.

Hillary won the college educated white women in 2016 &amp; Biden is increasing that gap. So suburbs are more at ease with Biden. Non college educated white women saw him as the noise and feel it‚Äôs not worth it with him being at the helm. What jobs he brought back from China?
Fuck him. Maybe after 8 months, 208,000 deaths, him mocking Biden for wearing a mask, ignoring Fauci, holding maskless rallies, and putting Americans at risk - him catching COVID will make him take it seriously. Maybe. Possibly.   Suffering is the only way he‚Äôll learn.
Well yeah he did won less votes because most people thought he‚Äôs insane and didn‚Äôt like him. Same was the case with Hillary. IMO polls are underestimating Biden and this isn‚Äôt a close election. Many people just didn‚Äôt turn out last time as they thought Hillary had it in the bag
And Biden attack ads Still running in Arizona against Trump even though he touts they  were pulled
Biden is so frail, he would never make it past COVID. I see the his obvious signs of dementia
He can't "reset the campaign" because Biden is still moving full speed ahead. And only the House has the authority to postpone the election. Oh, and don't mistake simple courtesy for sympathy. What are people supposed to say in response, "Die the most painful death imaginable!"?
Only Fox and Republicans would call for this. It‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault. He didn‚Äôt follow CDC guidelines. Biden did.

Exactly!  A number of his die-hard supporters voiced dismay after the first debate, some saying they will not vote/vote 4 Biden.
Makes you wonder what was in Joe Biden's "wiring" during the debate.
I would not be surprised.  Hicks tested positive on Thursday. On Wednesday he arrived late to the debate. It seems a convenient excuse not to submit to a test. If this is true, he didn't care if infected Biden.
Based on what Biden said he would have been even two months later than trump - any comment on that Rulon?
Why do you assume Biden had any role in the economic recovery after the real estate collapse? I am sure that Obama claimed the recovery for himself!!!

No, it was really just one side acting terribly and the other side being dignified and presidential. Now the bad side might even have given good Joe Biden COVID by not following rules for testing and masking before the debate too. Only one side was awful there.
Fact Check:  Gallup Question:   Regardless of whom you support and trying to be as objective as possible, who do you think will win the election in November?   Total:  Trump 56%, Biden 40%.  GOP :  Trump 90%; Biden 9%.  Ind   :  Trump 56%; Biden 39%  Dem:  Trump 24%; Biden  73%
We are at war. Ted Nugent said wars are won with relentless superior firepower. I do believe Jesus possesses such firepower. God bless you Lin. Make $Billionaires out of them both taking every last dime of all those that lied, especially Biden. Leave that family worse than Job.
I‚Äôm actually wondering: was this calculated? Did they know they were infected and decide to try to infect Joe Biden to even the playing field?
I can't imagine telling a Biden volunteer that...
I don‚Äôt care if they all want to go down in one ship but they never should have been allowed to put Joe Biden at risk.
Based on the  all access app, Trump is still a scorching Biden with totally dishonest, negative ads.
If we want a President Biden to restore the dignity of the Office of the President, then he needs to start now. Besides, we must get beyond thinking of political opponents as enemies. If we continue that, eventually they will be.
China did not allow anyone into China , get it ? They were too busy trying to cover their tracks on their own mess. Biden does not think very clearly and make ridiculous assertions like this one.
This is the Democratic Party!  This is what Biden brings to our America. #Trump2020Landslide
I also think the debate commission should be held liable if Joe Biden is infected since they did not uphold the rules of the debate.
Fair question. I'm a centrist dem. If they were going to turn on Biden, they wouldn't have run ads attacking  *Susan Collins *Lindsey Graham *MitchMcConnell  etc.  They know that the Republican party needs to be burned down.  That's all I'll accept.  PERIOD.  They enabled treason
Give Biden all the ‚Äònone of the above‚Äô votes and the ‚Äòunsure‚Äô votes and it still doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to Trumps WINüòÇ Love this push pole.
AZ residents getting these texts. Should be able to stop them. The answer is the most important issue is the fact that Biden is corrupt, senile and an imbecile. Fact, not an opinion.
Biden  choose  the safe, sound and scientific approach towards pandemic precaution. Whereas his opponent chose reckless disregard  of the risks and for the safety of Americans. Bad choices have bad consequences. Case closed. Wall Street is going to love Biden by the way.
Texas, Ohio, Florida and Georgia are tricky states. In my opinion they can either way but I feel Biden has an advantage in Florida and Ohio  and Trump has an advantage in Georgia . Texas in my opinion can very likely go for Biden but I may be completely wrong
Way more than Obama and Biden ever gave out in Economic Relief payments,.
I still find it absolutely hilarious that the Dems don‚Äôt like Biden bc he‚Äôs too center-right and the Republicans don‚Äôt like Biden because he‚Äôs too far left. We‚Äôre all so far down the politics rabbit hole we can‚Äôt even agree on why we don‚Äôt like the man lol
F/O why should he. He's stopping his negative ads toward trump. That enough. Joe Biden didn't make trump sick, trump did.
Isn't this what Biden had promised would be his COVID response?
My tech found a lot back in 2013 all implemented by Obama the biggest terrorist dirtiest president ever in history my to murder innocents for Rothschmhild #NWO  Obama Biden Hillary =PRISON THEY WERE HATED AND  STILL ARE TODAY!
Maybe this is why they want Biden to stop campaigning.
Funny. Biden called people who supported the confederate flag ‚Äúfine people‚Äù
Biden‚Äôs campaign should reinstitute the negative ads. The Trumps and their enablers are all trash.
Biden ain't Trump. But I hear you.
Not a Biden fan at all, but credit should be given were it is do. This is classy üëèüëè
Trump catching the virus isn't Biden's fault. Fox News can take a flying leap.
Joe Biden is setting the tone for decency, once again. He‚Äôs modeling gracious behavior toward an adversary. The country needs this to heal.
And you are for Biden because? I‚Äôm curious.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Gonna Whip His Butt‚Äù: Progressives Are Going Rogue to Flip Pennsylvania for Biden  #SmartNews
You mean, if Biden were an idiot. He is not.
No chance and you know that. They do not have the moral fortitude to apologize. Trump owes Biden a major apology for the cheap shot at his son but it won't happen. Scum do not apologize.
$750 question for you, Mr. Trump: Out of respect, the Biden campaign has pulled all negative ads. Meanwhile, your campaign has produced more (see attachments). Will you follow suit during your convalescence?
If Clinton or biden were president I‚Äôm sure we would 1,000,000 deaths from the Chinese virus and the press would burry the whole thing.
when Trump goes out organizing super spreader events, he complained about Biden staying in basement?   The world doesn't go around about Trump!
Jim Carrey is going to play Joe Biden. That ought to be easy. All he has to do is forget his lines.
Lmao the right was cheering on for Biden not making it to Election Day. So stfu
So it‚Äôs vanity, it‚Äôs optics, it‚Äôs we‚Äôre smarter than everybody else, . . .We all have choices in life. Biden chose safe, sound and proven scientific pandemic precautions. Trump chose to be reckless. Reckless disregard is the opposite of leadership.
My thoughts, #SuperSpreaderTrump and crew knew they were positive. They were late to the debate so no one could be tested. It was intentional to try and infect Biden and the rest. The next few days will be rough
Kellyanne Conway?  Is this an alternative fact?  Live updates: Trump at hospital after positive coronavirus test; Kellyanne Conway tests positive
Secret Service Agent Comes Forward About Joe Biden's Creepy Behavior Ruining His 2020 Chance  Wow!! Biden really is a groper of woman!! Where is the #MeToo movement or was it just formed for Kavanaugh? Liberal HYPOCRITES!!
BREAKING: Americans involved in early voting said it would not stop voting for Joe Biden. #ImVotingForJoe  #ImVotingForBiden
Absolutely. I just watched on the news how he made fun of Biden at the debate saying wherever you see Biden he is wearing the biggest mask that he has ever seen. Karma. He should have put that mask on and not kept it in his pocket like I said and you said Karma
guess i‚Äôm voting joe biden
She would be out telling the public what those two did to Middle East and home  False flag shootings  . She hates Obama and do did I Biden was a side kick so NO BIDEN you don‚Äôt know him !
Yeah, just like Biden would be if he ever got elected. PUPPET MAN!
Such assholes. The truth is that Biden will win no matter what. Murdoch needs to shut his network down and retire somewhere.
Kick the Virus's ass so you can come back and kick Biden's ass
If my mom were alive she would be out publicly speaking against Biden Cue to Obama Administration I don‚Äôt know why anyone would vote for a VP who  talks evil against President Sisi . That is a  a deep hurt to me.
Did he know he was already infected but wanted to do the debate and "kick Bidens ass"? Well he failed to kick Biden's ass and now he is very ill. The timeline is too tight.
Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Who Tripled and Still Lost the Afghan War, Endorses Biden, Says He Listens to His Military Betters Better  via
For any liberal , leftist, moderate or any Biden voters or supporters remember that Trump and his base are relentless . They are unapologetic about attacking , harassing , being racist, sexist, cruel. So.. NEVER FEEL SORRY FOR TRUMP OR HIS SUPPORTERS. He gets what he deserves
Hey you know who didn‚Äôt get airlifted to a hospital today ? Joe Biden
After all of the hypocrisy and evil coming from Trump and his supporters, should Biden and his supporters play nice or play dirty like Trump has?
Clearly Biden is the better human, but we knew that
But it also shows at Joe Biden is a very classy man and is a true leader
I believe it‚Äôs very simple.  The Biden campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to move is empathy.  The Trump campaign is lead by a person who‚Äôs go to moves are mockery and self-adulation.
Of course. It makes Biden look tougher than the fragile ego of the President.
Ok well said Mr. Biden
Omg I they text me today and I told them never support a Biden/Harris ticket and voting Mcsally as she should have beat Sinema!
you know Trump is lose on early election number. Trump 38% and Biden 55% and the  will put you down and in jail
While Biden has said he hopes Trump gets well, &amp; pulled "contrast" ads, on this day 4 years ago Trump &amp; his supporters mocked Clinton for getting pneumonia.  But, of course, Trumpanistas today are demanding we show respect to Trump because he's made himself sick.
Trump has always been a bully. He deserves NO SYMPATHY or special treatment in the final month of the election. He wouldn't give Biden any special treatment. #VoteHimOut  (I have to say I'm disappointed that Ivanka &amp; Jared tested negative.)
Oh you want us to pretend Trump supporters didn‚Äôt laugh at the idea of Biden dying before Election Day. Or how he was not going to make it and be replaced. Is that what you want us to do karen
Why should Biden suspend ?. He took all precautions wearing masks and maintaining social distance etc while the President of the US was actively disparaging Biden for campaigning from basement and wearing masks .
Agreed! The Trump campaign said they‚Äôre not stopping, so why should Biden!
The same way the right was laughing at the idea of Biden dying before Election Day. Give it to the Right for being a bunch of hypocritical sissies
Don't forget the shit he said about Hunter at the debate while Biden was talking about Beau. They are so disrespectful, even through times like this.
Biden is a good decent classy man. He‚Äôs exactly what we want for President. I ain‚Äôt mad at him.
This makes me even more enthusiastic for Biden for this moment. His focus on relationships. Bringing people together.
You mean how the Right was literally saying Biden was going to die before election. You guys are morons. Now that Trump is the one at risk of lying you can‚Äôt handle the backlash
Oh stop. The right has been wishing For Biden‚Äôs death. Saying he wasn‚Äôt going to make it to election. Karma you snowflake. Now you can‚Äôt handle the comments. What are your feelings hurt
As Biden and his team go high, you go low...class act üëé
Hell no. Biden should not suspend anything. No retreat. Never surrender.üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
I miss the old Biden/Obama memes from the 2017 transition.
The dummies are showing biden with a ‚Äújesuit‚Äù. Every evangelical living will never , ever vote for him.  The jesuits are at the top of the food chain for the left. Morons, absolute morons!
I keep thinking about Trump admonishing Biden: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever use the word ‚Äòsmart‚Äô with me.‚Äù
This might help explain why Biden tested negative, while Trump is in a hospital bed at Walter Reed.

If the roles were  reversed,  I shutter to think what nasty  remarks would come out of Trump's mouth toward Biden.
You crazy Biden campaign even pulled their negative ads about him right now. #realpeople #empathy #DonaldTrump #BidensUnitingUS #GetWellSoon
that's great joe biden.  don't forget we want M4A, GND and debt forgiveness.
I just saw a negative Biden ad.
Joe Biden looked up and thought it was Uranus...üòú
I think it's smart. He knows Trump wouldn't pull his. It makes Biden look like the adult, a leader.
Request to Biden. Can he please start wearing an n95? The surgical masks and cloth covers have less protection against airborne particles. It might have been mocked by Trump before, but now it seems necessary considering Trump x2, Hicks, Conway, McDaniel, Lee, Tillis, and more.
Biden is a bigger man than I, fuck trump and Cruella. Lie in state for America.
My opinion: with Trump sidelined for the next two weeks, Biden has a golden opportunity over the next week to really hammer home his vision of a post-Trump America and meeting the national challenges that go beyond repairing our divisions and the damage of the past few years.
Clearly Biden's a far better human than anyone in tRump's campaign.  Given that campaign's response, I say put back those negative ads!
I Watched the debate. What part of my comment do you disagree with? I was answering why they call Biden by his former tithe title of VP. I also eluded to the fact he has stated more than once he is running for Senator. I tied it together to say VP reminded Joe who he is.
Biden would never agree to it. But I would love to see each person forced to answer every question one t a time non loaded questions.
You mean the one that Biden confirmed and said, "he will make a fine AG"?
Hey asshole, Biden's not laying in Walter Reed either!

Yes. Despite everything they've done and all the rigging, they would mean he would have run a different campaign. as Biden said "I'm the Democrat party". Progressives might actually realize their leverage / power. They could restructure. Definitely move in the right direction
Trump should repay taxes and penalties, appear in all court cases, appear before congress, stop trying to steal another justice appointment, give DNA in sexual assault cases, face charges for not divesting his businesses. Etc.  Then we'll talk to Biden. Oh, and quit lying!

Dear God, you people are vile and every day you show us how great Biden is by comparison.
Nope. Personal irresponsibility by Trump &amp; his policy makers during a deadly pandemic is very much a matter of politics. Biden/Harris must win to defeat the coronavirus &amp; restore our democracy. Keep being aggressive politically. Victory is a must.

But Trump was disrespectful to Biden as well and he is a Vice President. I don‚Äôt understand
There is a long history showing Biden has a speech impediment, a stuffer. To reframe it as dementia is ableist and goes to show how low Trump and his supporters will go because they are desperate and can't argue on the facts.
