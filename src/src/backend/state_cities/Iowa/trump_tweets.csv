This is exactly like Germany, as the nazi party secured full control using violent, racist, nationalist "law enforcement" that seems to be the rule not the exception.  Layman, Trump deputized thugs who enjoy inflicting pain, terror &amp; suffering on innocent peaceful protesters.
He's not wrong. #JoeBiden2020  Give us reasons to vote for you, besides your not trump? I reccomend focusing on 1. Healthcare as a human right 2. Fighting systemic racism by legalizing marijuana, ending qualified immunity  #BLACKLIVESMATTER 3. Safe housing is a human right.

Evict Trump and vote for Joe Biden in November!!   #DumpTrump2020
Proba-bly. Here is Trump wanting to keep everyone out of the US and now we are not welcome in many countries. Go figure. LOL
You‚Äôd think so but I knew many Bernie supporters who voted for Johnson last time despite them having mostly opposite views aside from maybe foreign policy. Those democratic votes lost to the libertarians were in the end votes for Trump
Other countries have parliamentary systems... third parties can have a voice by joining with larger parties. We have a presidential system. If Jo gets 20% of the vote and Trump wins, Jo gets nothing except the part of a spoiler. It‚Äôs a flaw in our system but it‚Äôs what we have

Trump is such an idiot. This is the law already thanks to ACA which was passed by Obama and Biden.
No, we don't want Trump in Iowa. This is a perfect example of your hypocrisy. You put out statements &amp; commercials about being bipartisan, then you want to pull the biggest partisan into our state. Have you forgotten they intentionally ignored Dem states w/ virus?
Absolutely, it sure looks like Trump &amp; Dejoy are conspiring to suppress massive numbers of mail in ballots.
Sorry laura. Trump locked this down way before you became blonde.
OMG Trump is amazing.  I feel.kind of dirty like after signing up for Trump U or Trump Condos or his Steaks or allowing him to be President. Showers won't wash this stench off of America for a long  time.
Everyone who is wondering when Jewish people knew to leave Germany. That moment has come &amp; gone. Welcome to the trump empire. Donny has ended free &amp; fair elections by rigging mail in ballots, installing Ivanka patented ballot voting machines nation wide. Democracy dies silent.

I think we're more then half way. We can't leave the country, the postal service is being destroyed 88 days before an election, during a pandemic, after trump declared he wouldn't recognize a Biden win. The election has already been rigged by trump.
Trump's Mind-Numbing Interview with Axios | NowThis  via
Trump is already the best President the USA has EVER had.  I love him.
Trump's inability to pronounce "Yosimite" is not surprising.  He reads so little he's never before seen the word in print. Earlier this week he told an interviewer that he's a voracious reader. When asked what he reads he said "Oh everything." Reminded me of Sarah Palin!
Full stop. #TrumpHasNoPlan Actually he does, it is called election fraud, &amp; it's in progress. This is not a drill. Trump said not to trust the mail then gutted the leadership right before a general election. It doesn't take a stable genius to know he's rigging the election.
. , after all the Trump time you donated before the 2016 election, you do owe us this:
Trump has repeatedly bragged about cleaning up on real estate during the 2008 financial meltdown. He has openly hoped for another crisis--like the one he's currently creating. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
Trump is a racist  Pass it on
Not this country. Trump's country. We take it back and right the ship in November come hell or high water.

That may be something a Biden presidency would go along with but not in a Trump presidency.
For real. There is almost nothing worth redeeming of Biden.   Just that he isn't trump. And even then the caveat is that US politics suck so much ass that he's the only legitimate contender.  He fuckung sucks.
This is a full criminal attempt to cheat democratic elections, that trump knows he will lose. This is no brainer. Even  can't hide this one.  do your damn job, it's time to arrest trump &amp; barr. There won't be fair &amp; free elections. Democracy hangs by a thread.
That's already the law though. So what did Trump accomplish?
Sorry bro...you have no credibility.  Last I saw you....you with Trump in Texas at a campaign event in the middle of a pandemic not wearing a mask.
Trump's the enemy of the people.
Trump keeps pushing the payroll tax cut...that tax help fund social security and is a back door way to justify to cutting or eliminating benefits.

The #ACA (#Obamacare)  ALREADY DOES THIS  And the Trump administration is suing to get rid of it.  How stupid does he think the American people are?
We do believe. I‚Äôm a conservative who was against Trump from the start. I will vote for Biden. The house is on fire. We can put the fire out and then argue about how to rebuild.
There is that big bruise we keep seeing on the back of Trump's hand--just where you'd expect it to be if he were getting regular transfusions.
Maybe the Trump administration could just drop their lawsuit in the Supreme Court to TAKE AWAY our pre-existing condition protection -- which we already have with the ACA?!

I truly feel if the Dems replaced Sleep Joe with a moderate, likable candidate with Barack endorsing and calling for national unity, Trump would be in trouble.  There's a reason he's choosing not to.
Barack Obama is just as white as he is black.   Right now he has a chance to put politics aside and unite the country. He's one of the best orators of our time. He could be the bigger person than Trump.

Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered corporate and estate taxes permanently, and lowered most individual income tax rates temporarily while increasing them for some.
A key part of President Trump's economic strategy during his first three years (2017‚Äì2019) was to boost economic growth via tax cuts and additional spending, both of which significantly increased federal budget deficits.
Maybe if the  figures out that China helping Biden could negate Russia helping Trump and they will finally take foreign intervention in our election seriously.

could start by seeing if Mary Trump would give some DNA to prove a familial match. Would make a much more compelling case.
But that's what the corporate wing said the Republicans would call Bernie, thus Biden was the "safe" choice (nevermind the fact his numbers vs Trump were the lowest of all running at the time) if Biden is a socialist,  words don't have meaning anymore.

Following trump's orders by opening schools, kills children &amp; makes the teacher shortage much worse. Everyone following trumps incompetence, because "it's the law," is marching off the cliff knowingly. These are our kids. Stop doing what that fucking moron says.
Absentee ballot already requested, plan to drop off completed ballot early, in person, at county election admin office.  Hopefully safer than Election Day lines &amp; avoids Trump/Dejoy Post Office mail delay debacle which has clearly been set up to suppress votes.
You REALLY think NC, FL, and AZ are going red this year? I could see 1 of those going red, but it's very possibly going to be worse for Trump.

Trump is in charge and botched the pandemic response.  That‚Äôs on him.
The attack took place after Soleimani was killed.  Iran called his bluff and Trump cowered in his bunker.
Meanwhile Trump has done nothing to advance the pro life movement.
Another four years of Trump and the country will be begging for anything else and that includes Marxism.  Biden is not a long term solution but better than what we have now.
And when Iran injured a hundred soldiers in the rocket attack on the embassy in Baghdad...Trump did nothing. Same with North Korea. We have a Code Pink pacifist sissy for president.  North Korea could nuke L.A. and Trump would blame the libs and do nothing

You‚Äôre right Biden‚Äôs tough on crime bills were atrocious for black communities because lots of crimes that were victimless got the maximum sentencing but whites in America get far less time in jail for the same crimes why hasn‚Äôt trump tried reforming that?
You know what a trend is right? And you know the civil rights act was signed in 1964? That was one of the biggest things for blacks since slavery and the right to vote and it literally ended segregation youre literally quoting trump tweets üòÇ
It‚Äôs a new disease he was literally releasing stuff before it was even able to be tested. Fauci worked with the last 5 presidents including trump and has been bipartisan with all of them but trump literally hates anyone in the limelight but him
1. If you go to New York and ask people about trump they hate him there 2. Trump got taken to court twice on not renting to black people 3. The unemployment rate is at a huge low 4. The economy sucks and he is doing exactly what Obama did with his numbers
They should've ran a better candidate then. They didn't learn that lesson this time either but Trump's so bad people will vote for half a bowl of shit.
He literally inherited a good economy from Obama while Obama had the 2008 depression to work from. Plus he just grew the economic bubble by printing more money instead of using taxes. And that website says lowest unemployment rate for most minority groups but trump did nothing1/2
Yeah I do not to mention he doesn‚Äôt have millions of brainwashed followers like trump who can‚Äôt even acknowledged when he‚Äôs in the wrong and instead lies. Bunker boy only cares about himself and he knows he‚Äôs tanking, voter fraud has nothing to do with it
We all know Trump‚Äôs election tweet was meant to serve as a distraction. But I will not stand by and let the #NBA‚Äôs return be obscured.
Uh oh...what more has she done to Iowans to prove her loyalty to Trump?
Herman Cain dies from COVID-19 which he caught it at the Trump rally wearing no mask üò∑
Fun fact:  We can vote from a voting booth if schools and economies are open this fall.  Don't listen to Trump today. He's failed, getting trounced in the polls, and now he's saying in-person voting isn't safe?  I call BS.
Don't forget to add that Mr. Cain caught COVID_19 while working for Trump in preparation for the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Trump just had to pump his ego during a pandemic, failed, and people died.
A person doesn't need Trump to tell them anything. President Chickenshit just withdrew from Germany, and gave Europe to Putin.  He is a scared little boy trying to do a man's job.   #MAGA #VoteBlue2020
From the FAKE virus? How is that possible?? Trump said it "disappeared like magic".  How could it kill anyone if it disappeared???
You just lost Europe! Russia will take over now that you have pulled our troops out   Trump is the WEAKEST president, biggest COWARD ever.
Actually we ARE able to vote in person, and WE WILL! Trump will have his ass handed to him and he knows it!
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
JFC! I thought the most important thing was to defeat Trump?$300,000 for trump golf club NJ per Wikipedia
as a  you have my vote regardless. You promised to pick a VP by the end of the week. It would be great to have a politician keep their promise. Show Trump what that looks like! Again... you have my vote as does  - LIFELONG REPUBLICAN VOTER
There's a difference though: What we say of Trump is something he hates...the TRUTH.  Trump's statements on the other hand, he's lied so much to us, I am convinced his name isn't actually Donald Trump.
Donald J. Trump is the Clown Prince of Queens.
Yeah, not our best running against each other. Hopefully this is the last election where Boomers have a large say in. See  Trump's interview on Axios? I'll still take Biden this time around. Then Mark Cuban in '24!
The absolute hilarity of #DonTheCon questioning anyone's faith is mind-boggling. This guy has to worry about bursting into flameif he goes near a church but Biden is going to destroy Christianity. But then people who think  somehow Trump is religious are the ones who will do that
gets my vote.  didn‚Äôt even allow or want witnesses at the impeachment hearings. She is a member of the Trump party not the
He isn't a god. He is a good man, but not a god. He has flaws like us all. We must not deify any single person or you get Trump or Mao.
the people of TikTok know you‚Äôre a fucking loser. Peoplr dying of Trump Virus, unemployment soaring &amp; you‚Äôre fucking worried about a social media app. #goodluckdonniedumbfuck No company &amp; no one can be forced to sell a company let alone because you say so.
Yes, yes- the FBI, the American IC, the American military are all corrupt. We should just trust Putin and Trump, right?
Yes!  On this, we can agree! The truth will come out. Just like the truth that Trump took WAY more trips than Obama.  Just like the truth that Trump golfed more than any other president.  Just like the truth that Trump and his family cost the taxpayers WAY more in 4yrs than O n 8
More lies from a Trump member. Like father, like son.
Trump has gone full Cam Brady with his recent claims of Biden being against god.
Trump or this guy? Cool cool cool
Drove through rural Polk County today and saw signs for    and #VoteByMail signs from  #ruralDems REPRESENT!! (Also saw a Trump sign with a whole lot of BB holes. üò¨)
I've been using Twitter very infrequently lately. Using it now to make sure that  saw this segment from yesterday's  show.  Complete with X-files spoof at the end!
This is how Trump thinks when he‚Äôs pandering to 1A and 2A supporters simultaneously.
Trump is a talking potato. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be prudent to pursue this angle.
Simple enough: ‚ÄúHere LIES Donald Trump‚Äù
Pres. Trump does not need a test.  Look at all he has done for us,  too bad those Democraps have put him through He_ _.
President Trump is awesome.
Iowa will go Trump on November 3rd #Trump2020
The only thing Donald Trump and the Catholic Church have in common is they both have sexual relations with non-consenting persons, then cover it all up, and still claim to be following God.
President Trump. We can make America great by finding and prosecuting those involved with sex trafficking. Facebook hid a post for #savethechildren . Is Facebook involved with pedophilia?
"Yeah, Trump was bad but you have NO IDEA how crazy Pence was."
Pro-life Republican encouraging mistress and ex-wife to get multiple abortions between them, admitting to six affairs, handing out opioids like Trump‚Äôs own ‚ÄúCandy Man‚Äù did. No wonder Trump so heartily endorses this POS.
I‚Äôm worried about your husband-bipolar/maniac/depression/he is being used by trump/republicans to run for president/please for his mind &amp; health get him to stop-you know how celebrity can fuck with your mind/end up destroying a good soul that‚Äôs in him-he doesn‚Äôt need to be hurt
Trump may have heard Yosemite plenty over the years, but he‚Äôs too incurious and poorly read to have ever seen it in print.
You got it bud they just don‚Äôt want trump tried to take him down ILLEGALLY bunch of times it ain‚Äôt working!!
Imagine that, Trump supporters lying. I am shocked!
Ohhh?  $138,000,000 is substantially less than Obama?  Does that include the $$ spent on Secret Service during hunting trips to Africa? Skiing trips to Vail? Trump Organizations' trips to South America?  How much did Obama's 54 official, government business, trips cost?
Well, Fox News counts 275...
Trump has taken over 300 trips to his own properties in the last 3 years.
Well, the Clinton's and the Bushes have ties with Trump... The American taxpayers fund the military and the US Army is the OG Antifa.
Trump PROMISED he would give up golf, if he was elected.  Promises MADE, Promise....? Why did you insinuate that it was China's fault he went golfing, then say it was all part of the plan?  Do you know about some Democratic Party plan with China to Make America Great Again?
You said "no one blames China" for Trump golfing.  We don't know how much Trump has spent on fast food (hamberders and such) We DO know he's spent more than $150,000,000 of taxpayers money on "trips" while president, which is more than the last president spent in 8 years.
You know, I never said anything about protestors... are you saying they are ALSO part of the Democratic Party's plan to Make America Great Again while China forces Trump to golf?!?!?!
I, also, hope Kanye gets 107K votes in WI.  That should be enough to put Trump in 3rd place, in WI, right?
And since Trump was a registered Democrat, until he ran for president AND everything he sells is manufactured in China... I can see how you believe it.
Ahhhhhh, that's why you think Trump is kowtowing to China.  We should blame China for him going golfing because the pandemic and his response is all part of China and the Democratic Party's plan to Make America Great Again. It's starting to make sense.
That's what you said.  Trump went golfing while 2 hurricanes were hitting America, we are in a depression, there's a viral disease ravaging FL, armed insurgents, 20M are unemployed, millions infected, 150K dead... blame China, it's all part of the plan.
Today I was served a sponsored ad on Facebook for gold-plated Trump playing cards.  I can't decide if I should tell Facebook to stop serving this ad to me or to let these grifters continue wasting their ad money.
I ALSO hope Kanye gets 107K votes in WI. That should be enough to put Trump in 3rd place, in WI, right?
The Iowa GOP sends out an absentee ballot request form (even through Trump says voting by mail is fraudulent) and calls it an OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN ABSENTEE BALLOT APPLICATION. Because that‚Äôs a thing?
For Trump going golfing?  During 3 simultaneously occurring disasters? (Not including the 2 hurricanes) AFTER directly promising to give up golfing for four years if he was elected president?  Why would anyone blame China for that? Are you saying.... China controls Trump?
I... work. That's what I do when I'm under stress.  Of course Trump, has never worked a day in his life, so what can you expect from him?
*shrug* Trump has WAY more issues in this than Joe and it's only getting worse.  Have you watched any of his recent attempts at speaking?
? It starts with a video of Trump mumbling gibberish, then someone says "I'm with Joe". Then you comment on the video "He can't even form a coherent sentence".... And here we are.
Wow... You were talking about Biden, in reference to a video featuring Trump not speaking in coherent sentences?  Isn't that a little like... saying there's too much water in your glass after looking at the ocean?
If "Blunders errors in speaking are normal." Then why are you making fun of Trump not being able to form a coherent sentence?
He does!  Not coherently though.  I always feel like Trump could use some ESL classes.  He rarely answers questions. He doesn't say no, he just can't understand the question and is not able to answer.
You know.... I wonder about that.  With all the Americans Trump is killing, shouldn't the GDP per capita be growing?
That, that CAN'T be true- can it? I mean, the only one Trump destroyed in that interview- was Trump.
Nope, not just you.  I'm becoming more convinced that Trump, and the GOP, are campaigning for Biden.
Maybe that explains why Hinson called herself a ‚Äúrecovering journalist‚Äù when she introduced Trump at a local rally two years ago. That‚Äôs a good line for a budding Trumpista, but it tells too much about what we‚Äôd get if she won.
Is that worse than an omnipresent empty suit like our President? Trump has proven his lack of fitness for serving the American people multiple times daily for every single day of his term thus far.
Pretty sure the only reason Trump would have to fight human trafficking is so he doesn‚Äôt have competition.
She‚Äôs just like trump she doesn‚Äôt care about the deaths are about the virus she just wants everything to go back to normal and pray she can get reelected
We are not.  We are not going to watch the idiots that take a knee. We have Netflix and listen to our President Trump speak.
Anyone else surprised by the lack of outrage for Obama saying last week that the filibuster is a Jim Crowe relic?  It"s because basic Congressional procedural rules are too complicated for most Trump supporters to understand and get upset about.
What about punishing Trump for his trafficking?  ü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶ó
Trump reading ‚ÄúYosemite‚Äù from prepared speech pronounces it ‚ÄúYo, Semites.‚Äù  Trump is the most poorly educated and lowest IQ of any US president.
Yep, that's #CovidKim. She's dressed and ready for prison in that striped blouse. Joni should get one like it so they can all join Trump in the Big House.
So this came in the mail today. No registered Republicans live here. So is this mail-in voting or is it absentee voting? But Trump doesn‚Äôt want mail in voting. But his party sent this to me? Or is it not his party? Funny but my party hasn‚Äôt sent me anything yet.
An easily avoidable flub if Trump ever bothered to prepare for anything or give the speech a dry run in front of aides. Plenty of people around him that could correct him. Save him (and us) the embarrassment.
Trump is a buffoon. No wonder the world no longer respects us.
had a buddy post about Trump's axios video and called it "Tom goes to the President". HA!
That striped blouse that #CovidKim was wearing in the news conference would look good in prison alongside Trump.
Now #CovidKim is at 28%. Maybe not a mobster like Trump, but a retard like Trump.
This entire reply is just a cluster of bad faith. Good black people?  Nina Turner. Bree Newsome. Benjamin Dixon. Cornel West. Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X.  Terrible white people? Donald Trump. Jeff Bezos. Tom Cotton. Steve King.  That wasn't so hard.
"It is what it is."  is Trump.
There is no limit to the harm  will cause to our state and our public schools to advance her political agenda to please Donald Trump.
Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush are the only 1 term presidents within my lifetime.  The only thing bad about Trump losing is he will be among these honorable men, all much greater than him.
There's a couple of moments where he argues in favor of the point Trump tries to make as a way to circle him around to what he's talking about. But, yeah. That's a losing battle because Trump only hears "I was right!"
Ahead of the 2016 election, the phrase "If someone shows you who they are, believe them" was a common observation in my circle.  Trump's been working since 2015 to show people the ways he's not qualified for this position.
It's all projection.  It's why you hear Trump sycophants floating that Biden wants to duck out of the debates.  Biden has committed to three. Trump's committed to zero.
I get the feeling that Twitter is going to be nigh-unusable at least until 1:00 PM CST - because everyone will be sharing clips of that Axios interview with Trump.
Senator, with all due respect, but thats a load of BS and you know it. President Trump doesn't want to hear both sides but one side - his! Its never been what the facts but he believes the facts are.
Bottom line: Trump didn‚Äôt attend Lewis‚Äôs funeral because Lewis didn‚Äôt attend Trump‚Äôs inauguration or State of the Union address. He is the pettiest person to ever occupy the Oval.
The thing I keep noticing in this clip is the frequent, utter look of confusion Trump has on his face.   He has a talking point and a four-bar graph. That's it. He doesn't read the briefings, doesn't do his homework, doesn't prepare. It's all bluster.  And it's killing Americans.
Yeah, it's like NASCAR.  They all think it's "competition" and racing... people only watch to see the wrecks. A Trump press conference is a slowmo train wreck on live television.
The Trump lickspittle who turned his head while boys were being sexually abused is asking why someone else isn‚Äôt in prison. Peak GOP.
Mr. Trump, that's how we have done it since our country's inception.  Technology has made it easier.  Not necessarily perfect, but easier.  That's democracy.  Everyone's voices are taken into effect.    You will NOT cheat your way to a win.  End of story.
Sarah outsmarted Trump by setting her location to Canada
Goes to show, Trump's only support is from the "coastal elite" Those boat owning leftist radicals don't know anything about REAL Americans or REAL America!
Obama &gt; Trump.    ALWAYS!
Worst case scenario, November 4th.... Trump won?  Luckily, I already have a Canadian girlfriend and she's, like, totally hot and she's totally going to marry me and I'll just go and live with her.
Is it because Trump supports abortion and Biden is a Catholic?
I have been screaming since early January that the virus had taken over Italy/vile trump &amp; republicans knew it was coming then/being a infection control geriatric nurse/they yelled HOAX/Dem conspiracy-now she can‚Äôt get her shit together to actually function-test Utah wasted tax$$
You are TDS. A walking, talking definition of Trump Derangement Syndrome.
Trump‚Äôs three wives
Trump has principles?? üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Your president still calls Covid-19 the ‚ÄúChina Virus.‚Äù And you bitches will do anything to say he‚Äôs not racist. Trump supporters are a different fucking breed. Open your eyes. #Biden2020
Less than two dozen is ‚Äúout in force?‚Äù I know you‚Äôre used to blowing sunshine up Trump‚Äôs ass, but you know we have eyes and can count, right?
I couldn't help but notice that other had pedophile in his handle but a picture of Trump as his profile picture. Irony much
Surely Trump will fully accept the results and won‚Äôt have to be forcibly removed from the White House
I heard Hillary and Obama created the virus and have been waiting to release it when it would hurt Donald Trump the most. They‚Äôre just waiting for George Soros to give them the OK
# Jim_Jordan  I‚Äôm running for Senate in my home state of New Mexico because I know that the working families of our country deserve a leader who actually cares about their futures -- but Trump and the RNC have a big red target on this seat as a potential pickup for Republicans i
I hereby officially declare that the COVID-19 virus is named the Trump Virus after  who did nothing to contain it, and let over 150,000+ die from it.
I still like the idea of sending them all to a reservation and put Trump in charge.  Then, it wouldn't matter so much.
Ummm, can't you read?  Trump's suits, ties, golf clubs, hats (MAGA), banners, posters are all made in China.
Ummm...  China doesn't pay us. China hasn't been banned, ever.  Trump protects China because all his products are made there.  Heck, didn't Trump have the US send China money to save one of his businesses last year?
Felons are felons because they were found guilty at trial. Being impeached does NOT equal guilt. Being impeached just means being charged. Trump was charged by a partisan vote in the House and then found not guilty by a partisan vote in the Senate. Not guilty means not guilty.
China for virus and pandemic for Trump .  Poor leadership  Arrogance and refused to to expert.
You‚Äôre a useless congressman and not man enough to stand up for Trump.  He did grab you by the P‚Ç¨#%6
You're calling Donald Trump "far left" or is he THE far left?
I think that's understood, Donald Trump makes everything in China as does Kushner.  That's a big reason why Trump kowtows to China on everything.
Are you saying- they're discriminating against Trump supporters?
"Legitimate" "Disturbing" Yes, when he looks up- those soulless, cold eyes- Legitimately Disturbing.  The despair on his face "will this please Putin? If I don't please Putin, Trump will be so mad." Legitimately Disturbing.
You do realize, Trump LOST the popular vote- right?  He needed to PROVE his legitimacy. He's had 3 years, we're still waiting.
#realDonaldTrump,  Get more ads that tell the people to go vote and go out and celebrate for Trump.  Of course wearing mask.
Can you not read?  The economy has shrunk since 2016- the country is LITERALLY worse off, today, than on 1/19/17. Trump's obeisance to China, Russia, and North Korea has destroyed our military, economy and international standing.
Every time I imagine that- it looks like Trump, taking a soccer ball from Putin.  Then I remember, it's actually Trump bowing to Xi. Do you think the Russians and the Chinese fight or him or do you think they share?
Except that none of the manipulated images are to be found via any White House social media. Which means Trump isn‚Äôt the only one who lies. So do you, sir.
TRAPT is really trying to be ‚Äúthat band‚Äù that makes a comeback (when they were never truly relevant) by supporting Trump. y‚Äôall are horrible and always have been lmao. one hit wonders and that‚Äôs emphasizing it
I, also, signed up for some Trump stuff.
Absolutely Brutal Biden Ad Scorches Trump On Covid Failures  via

Yes!  Good!  Trump is a Russian asset.  It is known.
The Republican Party used to run about 40% of the population, now self-identified Republicans are at 30%. They number in their ranks gohmert, Graham, Jordan, Duke, Trump, Ryan.... People they don't have in their Party? Patriotic Americans.
yes... that‚Äôs what it is. trump smart
Trump‚Äôs pandemic
maybe if we all just go back to  trump won‚Äôt notice
Drunk Twitter isn't a good look. Have you been asleep the last 3 and a half years? There hasn't ever been a President as reviled, as clueless, and  as corrupt as Trump. It more an implication against  the people who voted for him in their gullibility and stupidity.
I think Trump and his allies must be thinking:  ‚ÄúHitler and Mussolini made it look so easy! Fascism is so much work to get started!‚Äù #thereidout
Alyssa, don't forget the Orange Horrible man also promotes doctors who talk about Alien DNA, astral projections, and demon sex.    Yet people continue to say "Trump is so great!"    No.  He's not.  He's as stupid as s**t!
Rolling back the "Made in America" taxes that Trump placed on American businesses, might be a better place to start.
And was it before or after he tipped the delivery driver who brought her in?  Just kidding, just kidding.  Trump never tips.  (Totally stole that joke from
Child care?!?!? What about JOBS?  Roll back the destructive Trump Tariffs!  ü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶ó
SHE IS TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR VILE TRUMP STILL IN OUR WHITE HOUSE ü§¨
I'm not sure who you are talking to but you MAY want to take a look at the approval numbers- most Americans hate Trump.
Yes, that is one of the reasons why America hates Trump so much.
Isn't it great when the WH, the GOP and Trump's campaign come out in favor of Joe Biden?
#AmericaOrTrump  Trump is a Socialist,  It is known.
But I was told the protestors would burn the courthouse down once the Feds left. Turns out, the protests died down when the agitators - the Feds - left. It's almost like Trump was the chaos agent.
Because Trump destroyed the international market for Iowa farmers. Maybe you should work on the root cause of this issue- Republicans in office.  ü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶óü¶ó
He is a husband , a father, grandfather and friend . No one in their right mind will rejoice over the loss of life.  Like many of you guys , he refused to wear mask. I blame that to Donald Trump. But hey, he might have signed the contract not to sue.
You mean the Covid that caused the Trump Pandemic?
No you are stalking President Trump
Fantastic job! Reply then block, so brave. Also, in case you are wondering- YES! Nancy is shredding Trump and she will protect America.
The Trump Administration keeps throwing great big softballs right over the plate to the  and they keep shelling them back at him.  #TheReidOut
Just being diplomatic. Maybe he could say "I'm glad that former President Trump is still here to help with the transition to the Biden presidency."
Why remove him from the premises? The Constitution doesn't even mention the White House.   Biden can just take the oath and set up shop with Trump still in there. He can call Trump an honored guest.  #thebeat
It's like Trump didn't know enough about the office to know its many many limitations.  #MTPDaily #MSNBC
CHUCK DON‚ÄôT COME BACK WITHOUT A DEAL BECAUSE TODAY WE HAVE THE WORST GDP SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION NOT KIDDINGü§¨&amp; vile trump wants to cancel our NOVEMBER ELECTION/it‚Äôs obvious he has NO CLUE ABOUT OUR CONSTITUTION BUT YOU NEED TO TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL ü§¨
Hey, has President Trump learned his lesson yet? I‚Äôm sure you are very concerned!
Scott and Donald Trump have zero grasp of reality and have no idea what they‚Äôre doing but hey! Great job guys
If you think Trump's suggestion to "delay" the election is in any way defensible, you can go ahead and unfriend me now.   It's anti-democracy. Full stop.
OK this shit is getting real.  Trump is seriously suggesting we delay the election.
Lol!!!! Demons what Demons? Oh Trump!!!!
You, you are talking about Trump there- right?  Except your numbers are a little off- he killed 30,000,000 jobs, not that piddling 25K you listed.
Awwww, shit. Trump has awakened "The Ancient Ones". There's no getting out of this now.Because from Pompeo and bot Trump it is meaningless. We don't really know it's true! The CIA is an oxymoron. And we know they lie to us all the time! Iraq and WMD? And while I feel for the troops if true, we did the exact fucking thing when Russia was in Afghanistan!  Stingers?
trump is the biggest danger to the security of a free state in america. the tiktokers are our militia, whose most famous victory was the sabotage of the tulsa rally. they should retain the right to bear arms (tiktok) to continue to wage war against our corrupt government
This is a hilarious tweet. Thanks for the üòÇ . During the Obama administration  every month of job growth always said negative news. Love when you complain other media gives coverage of Trump.
I had a dream that Trump just wrote a bunch of executive orders on stuff that was already passed by congress and signed into law by past presidents.  Wait, that actually happened???
Absolutely brilliant policy making here from Trump....except this is already a law under Obamacare from Obama....
U.S. intel: Russia acting against Biden; China opposes Trump
So preparing for Friday night show. I wonder if it will get mentioned that Trump is going to sign Executive Order that insurance companies will cover preexisting conditions? Which are already the law. Trump saying Thighland wasn‚Äôt ever mentioned this week.
So they want America to get back to help Trump, but only a few of them are working at  Isn‚Äôt that interesting?
No. Not just Trump. Aurora Colorado a black woman, her teenage niece, another black woman and the driver‚Äôs young daughter where in a car. Cops pulled them over because they thought it was stolen. By gun point they took them all out of the car. Cops didn‚Äôt check the plates or
Are we not going to talk about how Kanye West‚Äôs attorney getting signatures in Wisconsin to put him on the ballot, is also Donald Trump‚Äôs attorney in Wisconsin fighting his frivolous law suit against a small TV station that ran a damaging ad in March? How stupid is the GOP?
Cause most people want their kids back in school and keeping them closed for political gain helps Trump.
I can't vote for Trump or Biden with a clear conscience and there are many down-ballot races that are equally important. Also, what better way to work toward change than actually voting for something different? Oh, and KISS wasn't a viable option before you MADE it one!
All of my African American business friends are voting for Trump. They want to bring their community up not down!
Dr Fauci said it two nights before Trump said it!
Because they are doing better than the Obama years. Obama talked a lot but never did anything for African Americans. Trump has funded black Colledge programs and job training which has helped their community better them self!
Cover up for the Democrats.  isn‚Äôt mainstream media? Then what are they? Who says she is fair and balanced? Co-workers? Before Trump I thought Harris was great. A little bias towards Republicans. Now after two interviews with Trump she is not fair and balanced.
I call bullshit. If your not doing better under Trump your not working. Best economy of 40 years!
Because the think Biden is going to hurt God. Trump said so
This is NOT the &lt;insert party here&gt; States of America.  It's the United States of America.   can't lead this nation, only the parts who agree with him. It's time for Trump to make a Presidential decision in 4 years and resign. Let the  put forth a Republican.
Trump wins again.
So the article says that things Trump did could improve manufacturing jobs. So before the pandemic manufacturing jobs were on a decline. Steve didn‚Äôt mention that in his article. So you have to succeed with success. Trump didn‚Äôt have any success. Fake facts
This idiot from the Trump campaign had tweeted an article of a Trump supporter. He ripped on policies that said hurt American workers in the past that Biden voted for. Touting things that could improve with things Trump did. No improvements that Trump did.
Agree. But your former employer makes a big case of Biden gaffes and Biden‚Äôs mental health. When people talked about Trump‚Äôs mental health they would always say, well is that person a doctor? Did they examine Trump? But they make health analysis. Just hilarious I think.
Ya, superstar is correct. She is fiery and won‚Äôt let anyone Republican or Democrat get by with not answering her questions. Even the Trump campaign after her interview had to try to tweet facts to her. That is why I watch her because she is great.
Juliet it is interesting watching your old employer. Trump‚Äôs gaffes you see zero coverage. Biden‚Äôs gaffes and it‚Äôs on for a day or two. Thanks for posting it.
You just tweeted lots of the same questions. Not all. So you made my point that she could give Trump softball questions. Thanks
Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
So, Trump might have just inadvertently banned League of Legends and Fortnite...
Trump smokes mids
Facebook and Twitter Censor President Trump for ‚ÄúFalse Claims‚Äù About Coronavirus. What our President said is correct according to the figures.
Trump is doing something right then.
People laugh with Trump and at Biden
Yeah why are they going after fraud instead of valid charities! This is against Trump's agenda of allowing fraud! How dare they!
So when Trump loses Republicans will say that China was behind spreading the virus to hurt Trump in the election and to hurt the economy. You think I might be wrong?
It‚Äôs already starting. Conspiracy theories.  is starting with it this week. Blaming Democrats for closing the economy and having people relying on stimulus checks. Blaming Democrats that Trump can‚Äôt have rallies. So when Trump loses that will be why.
What is our kind of energy? Is Trump referring to oil and coal?
So the Trump administration doesn‚Äôt want mail in voting, but Chief of staff Mark Meadows said have drive up ballot drop off according to  Thursday. She almost acted like it was a good idea. I don‚Äôt get it.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tests positive ahead of Trump visit
Actually not. In a debate they can ask a candidate a certain question. I don‚Äôt remember  asking all the Republican candidates what they said about women. She just asked Trump that question. But nice try.
So now your scared? Biden‚Äôs double digit lead is wasting away. Maybe you should have put forth a decent candidate. Trump might be the worst candidate EVER and yet you Dems have fucked up the race so poorly you are hanging on by a thread.
Reporter is to tell the truth, right? When you had before the pandemic manufacturing jobs on the decline and now in less than 5 months 150 thousand dead from a virus you can‚Äôt tweet me and say Trump is doing a good job?
I guess you haven‚Äôt watched her on  and  the past four years. Trump gave her two interviews and Harris won‚Äôt say anything displeasing about the Trump administration or his policies.
If the name Eric Trump or Don Jr. are mentioned it will be a awesome day. I believe daddy can‚Äôt pardon state crimes. Hopefully America learned a lesson and never try the experiment again of electing a reality tv idiot rich guy for President. Look what happened.
Amazing how dumb tweets Katie tweets lately. Protest outside and an hour or a little longer. Trump even said being outside is ok because the breeze will blow the particles away. School inside for about six hours.
What? Sorry, she is way to bias for Trump. She would be giving Trump softball questions the whole time. Then give Biden difficult questions. At one time I would‚Äôve agreed, but not now.

While I think Trump need a to go, I personally believe Pence is more dangerous. They are both whack jobs, but Pence is a religious whacko! And Pence as President could unite the evangelicals that Trump is losing. The best way is to overwhelmingly defeat them all come November!
I think he should just say that he refuses to debate a con man and a liar. That a true debate on policy and issues is impossible with somebody who has no policy. And Trump's grasp of the issues is tenuous at best

Traditionally, when disasters occur in other countries the international community offers support. Given Trump is the President, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable to expect him to make a statement.
So is anyone from your former employer going to ask anyone from the Trump campaign about Trump mental health or just Biden‚Äôs like  did yesterday to Dr. Jill Biden.

Trump has done more for the the African American people than any other president! Obama talked a good story but never did anything!

Trump also had the right foils. The media is biased. The parties are corrupt. He also held Republicans hostage. For example, I can't in good conscience, vote for the baby killer party. As one voter said: 'He dislikes the same people I do.' Trump is the ultimate Rorschach.

‚ÄúSwing‚Äù Voters Are Staying With Trump, Says Liberal Pollster
HEIL Trump
Trump signed Executive Order suspending immigration into the United States three months ago. So no mention about that in this story Friday night. So are they crossing illegally?
So this is the narrative  is using for the increasing cases of the virus. They are coming across the border. So Shannon just made the point that people are crossing the border. I thought Trump closed the Southern Border.
So what do you think of Trump doing this?
First 3 gif were trump, Steve Austin and hogan
Democratic cities such as Portland and Minneapolis destroys their cities, request hundreds of millions of dollars from President Trump and they get upset when he declines it.. don‚Äôt destroy your town? Also don‚Äôt wanna hear complaints when your taxes go up as well.
Now this tweet surprised me. This is totally going against Trump and her employer narrative.
Why are you and a few of your co-workers always making the excuse for Trump? Oh, he‚Äôs joking. He‚Äôs just throwing ball of catnip in the grass. Not even all Republicans are thinking he is joking. Didn‚Äôt Sean Spicer say Trump‚Äôs tweets are official White House communications?
no matter what they will back whatever Trump will do or say. Even though that article said Trump was going to have the Federal Government negotiate drug prices. Trump signs another Executive Order and Fox News eats it up.
Wow. Just this week on   was going over Trump‚Äôs campaign promises kept. Getting out of NAFTA she gave a green check mark. Ya, I believe healthcare a red check x. Didn‚Äôt mention the drain the swamp.

Your are absolutely correct, President Trump! Pelosi &amp; Schumer are truly traitors to our great country. Please hold all of these enemies to America accountable. Especially that stain who has the office before you. Disgusting display making a funeral a political statement.
So I don‚Äôt get it Friday on  you had  say Trump tweet about maybe changing election was catnip. Why are more people on  defending Trump then Republicans it seems like?
Ya, I turned back after Trump got done talking. Disappointed in your interview with  You let him ramble on with nonsense about absentee ballots and you didn‚Äôt have any facts to push him on. Please do better next time.
Trump only wants to delay it because his ass is getting smacked right now by a dude that doesn‚Äôt even know what his name is anymore lol
What happens to these type of people when Trump is no longer president? I like to imagine that they literally explode.
Trump has been there for them. Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and others that been killed by the police. Great Trump is for keeping bad cops on the job. Keep America Great Again.
Great. When you see cops not being charged for Breonna Taylor murder after four months, Trump can have all the police unions back him. They are responsible for the bad cops still having jobs. This is from someone raised in a union household.
Ya, let here from the experts. So it seems the CDC Director didn‚Äôt know that COVID information wasn‚Äôt going to be sent to the CDC. So what is the Trump White House covering up?
Perfectly round eye sockets to match the eyes. Genetics?
Some type of medical or genetic issue?
I guarantee you that if Trump or other conservatives were mentioned in this deposition, it would have been breaking news and all day coverage by the two of you. Instead, bury it below 18 new TDS stories.

That from Tucker. Really. He thinks Trump is honest and not corrupt. Wow.
Just an excuse Trump is doing. Saying that he got the media to talk about it. Ya he did because he tweeted it and one of his Press Secretary‚Äôs said his tweets were official White House communications.
The 2011 White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner used to be notable for Obama dunking on Trump over the birth certificate thing mere hours after authorizing the operation to take out Osama bin Laden.  Now we have this:

You have no right calling anyone racist when defending the ultimate racist trump. You are utterly delusional and it makes me sad.  I feel sorry for you.

That is rediculous. That should be covered by military funds not to help we the people. Or maybe out of that slush fund the demanded last time. I think there needs to be transparency as to where all that allocated last was spent. I bet Trump and his goonies received a huge chunk.
Are you feeling the same about the Biden v. Trump commercials?  Or is it just the 'ladies' you dont like hearing from?  It's just the beginning of the political ad season so I suggest you get used to it, gentleman.
Were*. Ever since Trump, they‚Äôre attacking legal immigration as well.
Yes I don‚Äôt listen to epidemiologists, doctors, medical experts, and public health experts because MSNBC said quoted Trump correctly when he said something stupid.
Imagine trying to vote for one of these people. I'm considering not voting. Trump and Biden are both terrible. Plus lets be honest, popular vote doesn't count anyway. Electoral college wins elections. We need to educate people on this.
Trump just said CSGO or you‚Äôre all bitches.... thoughts?
And then Biden will say that Trump will put Black people back into chains, like he said to the last Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.
I'm sure Trump sees this as a two birds, one stone situation.
Exactly who could Biden pick that would force you to vote for Trump?
Me too.  Too bad IA Senators   continue to look away as laws are broken by Trump.   I'm horrified that they are supposed to represent me and other Iowans.  Ernst &amp; Grassley can't be trusted to uphold laws.

This, in a nutshell, is why Richard Nixon, by all accounts a very distasteful individual, was a two term (well, almost anyway). President. The public distrusted his opponents even more than him. Also why Trump beat Hillary &amp; has a sliver of a chance of winning again.

I watched their tag show where they had a huge promo about how they‚Äôre finally going to do something for women in wrestling and I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. Considering what WWE (and even TNA before) have done, Trump sounds more logical.
Trump took his because the media kept saying he had cognitive issues.  The results proved them wrong.  Joe...has shown signs of severe cognitive issues among other things.

The more senile Biden gets the more ‚Äúlook how dumb Trump is!‚Äù stories we‚Äôll get.
It's so cute when logicless people get argued into their sad corner and all they can do is pout and cry.  Again, it doesn't matter to you what Biden does or doesn't do. Because Trump. That's all you've got. Because Trump. Stick to that and you'll have a much easier time here.
I mean, it's a list of things you believe to be incrementally better than Trump.  Here's the deal: I agree with Biden that healthcare is a human right. The problem is that he wants to keep that human right from Americans. That's ghoulish.  And I know your response: BUT TRUMP!!1!
Umm... You could do this with Trump.  He appoints Pro-adoption judges, blah blah blah.  All of these are still... "but Trump!"
Actually, I'm just jumping to the end. Ask conversations with your type are the same.  You are wrong, you are refuted, you deny, proof is given, you lie to save pride, it's shown to be wrong, you say it doesn't matter anyway "because Trump".  So I'm saving a lot of time.

If you‚Äôre still buying into this moronic grift, it‚Äôs on you now. We can no longer blame Trump. His imbecility is as obvious as the sun on a clear day. Idiots staring at the sun are the problem.

What some people don't realize is if Trump wins, it's not just Biden who loses.  It's the whole country losing against a person who only cares about having himself come out ahead.
Guys, Bush was a great President compared to Trump.
I see your list below (all easily refutable), but here's my prediction: you don't actually care.  If he came out right now with a speech containing full-throated support of war and segregation and cutting the safety net to pay for more officers, you'd still say "but Trump".
Trump Supporters, I tell ya. Hahahahah
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Truly facts just don't matter.  It would just be so much better if they'd just suck up the truth and stick with the "but Trump" argument. It's not enough fur me, but at least it's true.  Instead they just lie lie lie.
if that's the game, and it is, then trump should stop doing interviews altogether.  rely on social media, ads, surrogates highlighting his good works for the american people. compare/contrast to biden's dismal record.

His policy agenda is further left than Trump's. He has at least "promised" free college and some other reforms. I don't even believe he will do everything he says, but the base he has to answer to wants a lot better things than the Trunp base.
I think it is a lot easier to push a Biden administration to do the things I want than a Trump one.
Lol, I feel it's pretty hypocritical to vote shame people after hating on blue no matter who (rightfully) for months. There are a lot of valid reasons why Biden is better than Trump, and people aren't evil for making that calculation.
Fighting tooth and nail for Iowa families by calling for a violent crackdown on anarchists protesting 1,800 miles outside Iowa
I will NEVER wear a mask, but I WILL go out and vote for the GREATEST President of all time!! Trump 2020!!
I think it is an EXCELLENT idea!! We need to keep Trump in office, if delaying the elections accomplishes that I'm all for it!!!
No if he delays elections then again it should be automatic win for President Trump!! NOONE wants that idiot Biden in office!!!
You support Donald Trump. Everyone knows most of what you just said is blubber and nonsensical and 100% hypocritical because.. you support Donald Trump. Literally everything he claims about Biden is simply a projection of himself. He makes you look stupid and you willfully oblige
This may be the dumbest tweet of the day.  And yes I have looked at Trump‚Äôs feed.
Seriously why do all Trump supporters dress so BADLY. The only ones who sort of skate by are the ones who wear suits and even then they usually fit like shit as well. As he would say. Sad.
What about Baron‚Äôs school or you and the trump brain trust could tutor him
If you wanna try to diss people - I suggest that you do it correctly. Otherwise, you‚Äôll look stupid. Also, if you defend Donald Trump, you‚Äôll also look very stupid.
Don't vote shame us, screams the lefty perpetually vote shaming people who hate Trump more than Biden.
It‚Äôs actually shrewd, albeit highly cynical, political gamesmanship. Trump hiring &amp; believing Fauci is the single costliest political blunder in the history of the planet. Democrats are just capitalizing on it.
Trump is out there floating trying to push back the election, and Biden is out there claiming the COVID vaccine, when it comes out, might not be "real."  They are both terrible
Be sure to do a better, more angrier dance when Trump wins again. Good luck finding an alternative to TikTok though.
Donald Trump is purposely screwing up the USPS and it‚Äôs ran by one of his donors
It's going to be extraordinary to look back on the Trump era and see the full view back on just how willingly so many like Reynolds, Grassley, and here Ernst bent to the president's plainly incompetent whims virtually every step of the way.
Accidentally put on a 20 year old movie that literally threatens President Trump. üò±üò≠üò±üò≠
The Twins look really good.   If COVID cancels this season, there I no way I am voting for Trump.
Interesting documentary. Worked for Joseph McCarthy, Mob lawyer, Trump lawyer, friend to the famous &amp; powerful, closeted homosexual who died of AIDS.
I refer to the Trump offspring as the Stepford Children. Change my mind.
Trump deleting tik tok from America is a major blessin. That shit was stupid anyways with those dumb dances
my question:  what's up with  /chris wallace?  he pushes trump and those associated with trump around like a polite bully and lets the dems skate.  just about every time.  not cool.  at all.
Encouraging people to vote for trump is voter suppression? By the way Biden did promise an African American VP.
here is the most divisive person in government.  the trump virus?  how dare you?  and i say that in the most prayerful way.
Joe, you're confused again. It's the Dems that seek to fundamentally change the nation taking us away from freedom and democracy to Marxist totalitarianism under dictatorship rule. I will vote Trump because I don't want the US to become a China-North Korea hybrid style country
'Wrong!' Trump Rips Fauci After He Touts Europe's More Effective COVID-19 Tactics
So many people think they're voting against Trump.  In reality, they're voting FOR the Dems to keep forwarding the oligarchy.  Don't vote for a party that ignores what the voters want. Don't support the two parties hurting citizens.  Learn from other countries: vote other party!
Yeah bro I'm sure Trump will arrest all the pedos any day now. Just like he locked Hillary up
Trump himself pushed the conspiracy theory that Obama was not an American citizen lol
Didn‚Äôt trump use Cambridge Analytica to do the same thing in 2016?
If you try to defend Donald Trump, you deserve it every time he then immediately makes you look really stupid.
Trump will do everything he can to try and steal the election.
A whole ass Trump rally just drove down my street. That was uhhhhhhh interesting to say the least.
Donald Trump Ripped After Calling Surprise Press Conference During Barack Obama‚Äôs Eulogy For John Lewis
Biden Faces Pressure From Left Over Influence Industry Ties - The New York Times.   Please Mr. VP- this resembles Trump‚Äôs swamp. #JoeBiden
the huffpost folks will do ANYTHING to promote the democrat narrative about vote by mail.  duh, absentee ballots are mailed in because the voter requested the ONE BALLOT.  Trump Urges Voters To Use Absentee Ballots, Which Are, Uh, Mailed In
I wish Trump would ban all social media so some of you fucks would get a life
Trump is bad at work golfing today. No urgency on his part as thousands of our neighbors die today.
Trump is creating a false reality through disinformation via state media.   I refuse to let our nation crumble because of one orange jackass.
America: We need social justice, equality, and regulations that make us safe during a viral pandemic.  Trump: I'm gonna try to ban TikTok because they hurt my feelings üò°  #DownWithTrump #OurPresidentIsAnOrange
Trump supporters literally think they‚Äôre smart when they bring up these ‚Äúarguments‚Äù lol
No I literally from 2days ago. You retweeted trump a couple times 2 days ago. Didn‚Äôt go far.
we are going through a literal pandemic and trump is worried about banning tiktok I wish I was surprised I really do
Trump literally votes by mail in ballot. So does his cabinet. So did his press secretary. These are known facts. What does that tell you? Haha
From CNN: McConnell signal to Republican Senate candidates: Distance from Trump if necessary McConnell signal to Republican Senate candidates: Distance from Trump if necessary
Good to see Trump is making decisions about the country off how many retweets he gets.....
Trump is one of the most decent people that have been president.  Obama on the other hand one of the worst snakes we've had in a while. Spying on Trump,fake dossier,Russia investigation coming up with zero. And more.  MAGA 2020.
I say we try it. I mean, the trump admin is only going to attract fake Christians
Wrong. 1. Not all Dems support Defund the Police. 2. Defund the police doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it does.   Also, pretty funny hearing about ‚Äúhead in the sand‚Äù from fucking conservatives/trump supporters.   151,000 dead Americans from Covid 19 and y‚Äôall can‚Äôt put on a mask.
Yep totally dude. Totally brainwashed. Anyone who disagrees with trump is obviously brainwashed by reading the news.
Thanks Britt for your enlightening post. Today, in Iowa, we buried a friend who died of COVID.  Her entire family are registered republican,  but all 20 plus friends will be voting Democrat.  They are done with the Trump &amp;GOP BS.
You know that trump and his cabinet all vote by mail right lol
They‚Äôre desperately trying to deflect.  There‚Äôs evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton, no evidence of Trump doing anything in fact there‚Äôs evidence that clears him, yet they still make it about trump.   This is why he‚Äôll win in November, people are tired of these shenanigans.
"It's 50-3 in the 3rd quarter."   on where Biden vs Trump stands at the moment. Biden has 50.
... we know you only care about $$$, but really?  Asking you #losers to lead you State out of #caronavirus2020 and economic disaster is like asking #trump to complete a full sentence.   Every minute an American dies.   #WearADamnMask

üí© Job&lt;--- how I'll think of Trump from now on everytime I hear his name üòÇ
Not fighting with a trump supporter. you tried it thoüòÇüòÇI‚Äôm losing brain cells just chatting with youü§¢
Sometimes I get mad and report all of trump's tweets that are racist or share misinformation about about voting/elections. Spoiler alert: there are a lot of them
Joe Biden‚Äôs America is 1000x better than Trump‚Äôs America.
Texts from Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign team makes me feel like I‚Äôm failing a mission from an early 2000s video game. Just imagine each little character popping up with the blurb.
Hmm, I moved into this apartment a few months before trump was elected in 2016, and now I'm moving out a few months before the 2020 election. COINCIDENCE? You're welcome in advance, libs
If you buy the argument that the virus is more likely to scare Biden voters from going to the polls than Trump voters there is no need to consider moving the election.
Oh of course, you can chat about baseball, but you can‚Äôt comment on Trump trying to destroy democracy by calling to cancel the election. Resign!
I am not a George Bush guy but at least he has some amount of decency and I feel he is capable of compassion. I think it would be great for our country if he took a more public approach to opposing Donald Trump. He lacks both of those things.
Letter: "Equal justice requires that all people - whether Trump friend or foe - are treated the same under the law."
The politics of the American right and the RepubliCON party will get appreciably worse beginning now and until Trump loses on Nov. 3, 2020.  Thank me later.
Oh Mike.  Posting this on the day we bury an icon, John Lewis, on a day when Trump wants to illegally postpone an election, let's talk "coddling".  Restoring law and order starts Nov 3.  FYI, 59 yr old white Iowa female. You've lost the heartland.
That's lovely but both Grassley and Cornyn have no spines, so if Trump tries to move or delay the election, they will do nothing.  If we were a country based on rule of law, Trump would no longer be president.
Oh course he did.   Trump is such a whiny toddler.   I suggest no one show up.
listent to this shit.  "trump is going to prison".  in your dreams mr. palmer report.
But appointed by who?  If they appointed by Bush, then I'm not as concerned as if they are new appointees by Trump
Trump demands kids go back to school because it's safe.   But insists on delaying the election because it's not safe?  What am I missing here?   Trump Suggests Delaying Presidential Election Due To Mail-In Voting
He was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and it was in remission. He possibly contracted Covid from the Trump Rally in Tulsa he visited 11 days before he tested positive.  Covid killed him, and I feel awful for his family.
Herman Cain, who contracted the Trump virus at the Oklahoma rally is dead...maybe you can put that in binder
Obviously he doesn‚Äôt believe the narrative that Trump is a racist.  Is it okay for him to have that opinion?  Just because you think he‚Äôs a racist doesn‚Äôt mean the rest of us have to...
Trump You are a great embarrassment to the USA. Almost everything out of your mouth is INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT. The most historical part of your presidency will be the number of voters demanding your removal from office in 2020. Do yourself a favor and resign.
Donald Trump already knows that he is going to lose and is trying to discredit the election.Kanye West's unlikely White House bid is getting help qualifying for presidential ballots in key states from Republicans around the country, fueling suspicions he's being pushed to run by allies of President Donald Trump
I sure hope we can make Trump a one term president, TOGETHER! üëç
I think trump should fly in and have a rally!  I mean they aren‚Äôt billionaires stealing our taxpayer money, but they love him just the same.
Yet they are putting out daily anti-trump content reaching how many thousands? You're right they're complicit in how we got here, and may not be allies after the election, but I believe they're having a positive impact now. Use them.
New jobs? Losing a lot and gaining back some is not progress, it‚Äôs just less shitty than before. Trump logic: If I lose $100 and find $30, I‚Äôve gained $30ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I sincerely hope someone is telling Biden to shut the hell up &amp; let Trump hang himself. There is plenty of rope. We don‚Äôt need Biden saying something stupid now, or inadvertently touching someone in a suspicious manner. Pick a female VP, and let‚Äôs get on w it.
So Trump does not practice racist ways and tendencies?
So trump is Not a racist?
They'll probably start opening Sundays so Trump can call it "job creation."
#Dinesh Mr. Trump paid someone to take his SATs.  He won't release his transcripts--odd, isn't it, when they SHOULD be proof of his 'very stable genius'?  And people who have followed his finances for years agree he is nowhere NEAR a billionaire. Cosmopolitan? The world laughs.
Absolutely get rid of Crazy Trump!
Is there anyone better? Hell yes I'm voting for Trump!
unless you're at Trump's Country Club.
#EndTheNightmare Trump is the nightmare.
Well since you are going to takeaway incentives for people to hire people and/or pay people more.....i will ensure that i vote for trump. Oh who am i kidding i was voting for trump before you decided to try another failed run at the presidency. Ha ha ha ha!
NEW: China wants President Trump to lose the 2020 election &amp; Russia is trying to harm Joe Biden's chances, the head of the National Counterintelligence &amp; Security Center says.  Details:
The one fact in all this is that God knows the truth. All judgement is His! That fact is really all that keeps me from going off the deep end with Trump's madness.
Reddit says it's investigating an attack that flooded the site with pro-Trump content - MSN Money  via
Same damn old story, different verse, anti-immigrant, socialism sucks and now you want trump to come the state of Iowa.  It is now abundantly clear that your business supporters(Big Ag for one) and trump is all you care about.  I just can't believe your so ignorant about this.
well it looks like Trump is winning on the issue
But 'alien' is a pretty good descriptor of Mr. Trump.  You have some experience in higher education, don't you, Dinesh?  Why, again, were you asked to resign from the presidency of The King's College?
Mr. Trump had to pay someone else to take his SATs, &amp; refuses to allow the release of his academic transcripts-which seems odd if they would confirm his wild boasts about his 'very stable genius'. Those familiar with his $$ over many years scoff at his claim to be a billionaire.
Just imagine where Trump would be now, without Russia's help. I'll give you a hint, a very small room with no window and bars across the front of it!
I bet there will be alot of it and did you know that the Trump administration goes by another name, in my opinion?? THE BS ADMINISTRATION! ü§£üòÇ
looking desperate when you have to use Biden's yesterday comment as 75% of your reporting today. #Biden2020  it's refreshing every once in awhile I get nervous that trump will scam his way to re election
The people saying "A vote for a third party is a vote for Trump" are, ironically, helping Trump.
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Donald Trump does not win reelection, while Russia is working to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden.
This pure Bullshit as remember when  trump said he didn‚Äôt like POWs?  That was it for me although I was disgusted with him since day one.  You simply can‚Äôt believe ANYTHING trump says and that includes good morning if he does use those words which I doubt.
The fact he isn‚Äôt Trump is a big part of it. My antipathy to Trump is deep. Otherwise, I‚Äôd note that he was for gay marriage way ahead of anyone else, including BHO. Good relationships in both parties, not a radical, speaks in complete sentences. Not perfect. My 280 are up.
A lot of us pray fervently...but for different things.  Such as for a president who is NOT the most ignorant, most dishonest, most incompetent, most corrupt...and least compassionate in our nation history.  We pray this national Trump nightmare will end in 3 months.
No.  The Democrats built the economy.   Trump just rode what was in place, until he crashed it.  Now Biden will have to start over
#Biblicalidiot President Trump demonstrates this on a near-daily basis.
Putin has Trump in his pocket. That‚Äôs all I need to know.
This isn't actually a bad idea.  Trump's beliefs towards equality and justice are straight out of 1919.
What Holy Scripture has President Trump shared?  He finally (after much pressure) revealed what his 'favorite' Bible verse is:  'an eye for an eye'.  (See Matthew 5.)  He argued w/ the moderator at the Nat'l Prayer Breakfast in Feb. about 'loving your enemies'. (Again...Matt. 5)
I think this is the right way to go.  You can‚Äôt bully trump. He‚Äôs just gonna do whatever the fuck he wants. But we can bully Biden, break him down, and force him to adopt progressive policies. He‚Äôs already given a few conssesions. It‚Äôs obviously not ideal, but idk what else to do
*barf*  What have you been smoking out in those fields Chuckie?  Another 4 years of Trump would destroy this country.  Just ask the families of the 160,000+ dead Americans.
Time to retire    If you can‚Äôt see the massive damage Trump has done to our norms, our system of government, our position on the international stage, and the Constitution itself, well ... ‚ÄúGod, Chuck, I don‚Äôt even want to know you.‚Äù
IMO, There is only ONE who is BAD (Trump) and one who is GOOD (Biden) GO JOE GO!!! üòÉüëçüá∫üá≤üåé
You are speaking of trump, correct?
(3) ... when a US company like  or  buys  outright and addresses the concerns expressed by the Trump Administration and federal government. #tiktok #tiktokban #trump
Must be taking tRump lessons.
It's literally what they do.  The norms of what are legit accusations to levy at your opponent are out the window with them.  I mean, Trump just accused Biden of trying to "hurt God" yesterday - and the ridiculousness of it aside, that's a really bad thing to say about any one
Unemployment still over 10 percent and another 1.2 million first time Unemployment claims last week.  All because of tRump and the GOP.
Compared to who? Compared to Ike, FDR, JFK? Sure. Compared to Trump? No way.
Except for maybe Donald Trump. It may be a shame he hasn't been locked up for life. (I'm willing to make an exception for those whose thievery was not a crime of poverty. Then again, even selfish people really should have the opportunity for rehab.)
I say this all the time! Trump looks like a cardboard  cutout when he grins for a photo op and gives the thumbs up.
The arsenal is so full of vile shit Trump has done. Post it all!
I say that every time. If almost anyone this side of charles manson had run opposite Trump, they would have won. Hillary, right or wrong, is just not a likeable person.
What exercise helps you the most with relieving stress and clearing your mind of Trump, Covid and all of the other things in life that upset you? For me, just getting outside and walking seems to help.
It looks like Trump is beating Huawei
Sounds similar to the tactics of Trump Foundation. On steroids.  Not to mention all the Russian $$$ that flowed thru NRA to support Trump and GOP candidates in 2016 elections. Disgusting!!   #GOPBetrayedAmerica  #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Yep. I'd like these people to tell me what, exactly, are Trump's policies? They seem to be 1) enrich myself, 2) racism, and 3) get re-elected. Biden may be seeking office when he should fricken and he clearly has racial bias he hasn't dealt with, but he's nothing like Trump.
National Park should pay attention to how tRump has shrunk some areas and tried to allow drilling in others.  That's NOT preserving.
I'm more worried about after the election,  if tRump loses.  He'll do his best to take the entire country down.
It‚Äôs glad to hear, I voted for him in 2016 but there just comes a time when you know something isn‚Äôt right with this guy.. and now the whole ambassador with the golf bribe for Trump. It‚Äôs one corrupt thing after another..
It‚Äôs glad to hear, I voted for him in 2016 but there just comes a time when you know something isn‚Äôt right with this guy.. and now the whole ambassador with the golf bribe for Trump. It‚Äôs one corrupt thing after another
I think understanding 40 years of hollowing out our industrial, manufacturing, and mining industry would help. Free trade is fine but when it‚Äôs not fair there has to be counter measures. Trump stated many times he is for no tariffs and completely open free trade.
True but it was Trump who made the absurd comment.
We've been told plenty of times to realize what Trump was trying to say as opposed to what he actually said. That being said, I claim the same rules for Biden.
That interview wasn't great but you can make anyone look dumb if you confront their lies (I know Trump does lie) I am not saying Trump is perfect or even great but he is a hell of a lot better than the guy who thinks he is running for the senate
but again how does that relate to the KKK he is just increasing the livability in suburban areas which will raise property values and if we talking about black poverty pre corona I think Trump was beating Biden on that front
Come November 3, 2020.....the silent majority will speak loudly at the polls.....TRUMP 2020!!!
I would presume Trump but I can't speak for all of them
Three teenagers are accused of jumping a wall to get into President Donald Trump‚Äôs Mar-a-Lago resort. Palm Beach Police say they had an AK-47 with them.
Actually Trump has helped the black community significantly  pre-presidency and while president if you would like examples I would gladly tell you and Biden well he has done his best job to cripple the black community through his 50 years in politics
The irony of a Trump supporter telling the Obamas they need to be more Christian... there are no words.
I hate Mitch McConnell more than I hate Trump.He pretended to have voters‚Äô best interests in mind. Trump never did.
It depends if they are black or white because a black antisemite would most likely be anti Biden and Kamala  a white antisemite is most likely a neo nazi version and they probably are pro trump
Cult of Trump. Disgusting.
Not me, don‚Äôt get your lips chapped kissing tRump‚Äôs ass.
‚ÄúTikTok is spreading conspiracy theories about COVID. That‚Äôs my job!‚Äù shouted Trump, vigorously signing his executive order with his massive black Sharpie.
WHY would they choose Trump??
She will do what she always does, clutch her pearls and vote with Trump.
Any thoughts on this? I don't see any good with anything he signs. IMO.  Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok
President Trump ordered a ban on 'transactions' with Chinese owners of TikTok and WeChat
But I think those voters who are closeted antisemites are anti kamala and anti Biden they probably are going to vote with trump cause he is pretty  straightforward
Every move Trump makes, that makes no sense in timing, is a diversionary tactic. Always. Think about it!
This is one example of Trump not using military force.  He has been the most hesitant to use force.
This dude is the CNN national security reporter and he hasn't a clue about Trump foreign policy.
This is CNN.  Hey guys at CNN, this is the same President who called off a raid against Iran due to possible excessive citizen casualty.
Here's what's at stake if Congress can't make a deal: -$100 billion to help reopen schools -Another round of $1,200 direct payments to most Americans -Hundreds of billions of dollars for state a local governments to avoid furloughing more workers.

I don't know who needs to see this, but if this isn't Trump and kushner I don't know who it is. üòÇ
Biden said today that he would not stop a past president from being prosecuted. Today Trump said Joe Biden could hurt god.  Pretty good day for Biden.
Never Trump pretty much means ‚Äútraitor‚Äù considering what is at stake in this country at this moment.
How will you feel when the first child is hospitalized or dies because of your need to support Trump's back to school experiment? What will you say to the parents? They will be mad and may go to media. Will you regret your decision?   It will happen.
Biden has bowed his head in prayer more times in the past couple of months than Trump has in his entire life.
Is that why you keep voting against the ACA and SNAP?  Is that your idea of help?  Where were you when it was time to uphold our constitution during the impeachment trial?  Oh yeah, sewing your lips to Trump's backside.  #PhonyJoni #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

So you‚Äôre proud to be a trump republican?  Good to know who the racists are.
and that demographic is mostly ..... white, middle-later aged voters.  hmmmm...  Not sure what it finally took for them to sour (list is too long)... but my faith in them voting for a person who can beat trump is small.

Your source is Donald Trump Jr. it‚Äôs the stupid leading the stupid.
Guess you were too busy being tRump's buddy to notice that the Democrats in the house passed one 7 weeks ago.  Get busy.

dems gotta run thru the tape but I think these pocketbook issues isn‚Äôt going to allow some people the luxury to vote for trump cause they hate PC Liberals or SJW. the economic pain is too widespread and deep for people to vote based on those issues  people voting on survival
Wait till he looses the election. The secret service will have their hands full protecting Biden from gin toting Trump guy.
Because whoever he announces he is going disappoint portions of his base and why take the attention off trump and the republicans in Congress and how they have stabbed working people in the back after raiding the treasury for trillions in tax cuts for the 1 percent
Trump encourages mail voting in Florida but sues in Nevada
you must be talking about Trump's lies. He is no longer able to lie to the public......we see those lies as real facts.

Would SOMEBODY please shut Trump up.
That is three things in fifty one years. Trump has done more in three years.
Yes, the coup has been talked about for 3 1/2 years, had proof even for 2+, many have lost hope for justice..those that even know.  had barely any live coverage of the hearings today. The MSM never covers any anti-Dem findings, only anti-Trump, now only God can save USA!
I can't wait! I'm tired of Trump, I'm tired of quarantine, I'm tired of campaign ads, hell I'm just tired.
How are you holding up against Trump!?
I'm sure Lisa, that neither of us wants another four years of Trump's America! üò∞
no, I am saying Trump was caught saying manipulative stuff like we are lower than the world that isn't anything new Trump always does this just like other politicians
The Trump campaign used an unauthorized and altered Gazette photo in an attack ad against Biden -
The only positive in it is I can walk away, my husband couldn't. Long story short he was raised to be very kind to his elders to the point he listens to this BS and just bites his tongue. He hates Trump, and has told them all this and why.
Facebook deleted a post from President Trump Wednesday saying it violated its policy "around harmful COVID misinformation."
TRUMP IS DEPLORABLE!
that was just Trump bragging about himself and getting caught in manipulation whereas Joe well we don't even know if Joe knows he is running for president
Tonight my husband was talking to his aunt, a MAGA, she told him God spoke to her and said Trump was the Chosen One and she is to vote Republican to save the world.  And she believes this. üôÑ I just walked away have had too many of these pointless convos w/ his family
I shouldn't laugh at this but I did. It goes to show how gullible Trump voters are.
I can not believe  airs these lying sessions at all. As soon as you cut to Trump, I cut to Motor Trend channel.
The real reason Trump is obsessed with TikTok has nothing to do with security
Facebook has deleted a post by President Donald Trump for the first time, saying it violated its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.
Pure Bullshit lady.  That is totally wrong. But go ahead and vote for trump .......
Me too! I'm sure Leslie, that Trump is using him to defeat Biden! That is why we must ALL vote for biden. It will take every vote out there.
I wondering if you can say that you need to go out every night to protest and promise you will visit BLM in front of Trump building, they will let you out.
Trump may think Biden praying in church makes him look weak and alone, but those of us who know God ourselves know the opposite is true.
Donald Trump‚Äôs three and a half years in office have been a relentless assault on the foundational principles of American democracy.¬†He has driven the divides within our communities, undermined our ability to stand as an example to other nations, 1
I know.  Most seem to get 'proliferation' right.  My example was that Trump said 'proriferation'.
I did.
GOOD FOR FACEBOOK AND TWITTER!!!üëç  Facebook, Twitter remove Trump coronavirus posts of Fox interview about kids being 'almost immune'
It really disappoints me that Liberal news networks decide to be *barely* critical to Trump in interviews, and milquetoast libs go crazy.   Like you waited 3.5 years for CNN and fox to push back like THIS??
And  for that prayer photo, and, well, my paper, for this.
Hi  - I took this photo here in Iowa for  . We have a story up about it:
Citing pandemic, Trump campaign asks for earlier presidential debate
Dear Kevin McCarthy: This is a mega health crisis created by Trump with no value on human life. Keep country and human life above Party.
I don't think there has ever been a less pro life, less justice oriented president. Wtf is he going on about? This Catholic does not have to be and is not with President Trump.
President Trump asserts AGAIN today that the virus is 'just going to go away'.
You might want to do a LITTLE research on some of the white supremacists who have been arrested for fomenting riots.  Oops.  But we agree on ONE thing:  President Trump has ZERO integrity.  And ZERO credibility.
I‚Äôm a liberal and don‚Äôt see you as a villain at all. I like hearing your opinion, but it does help that you think Trump is a complete moron. ‚ù§Ô∏è
President Trump, again trying his best to read, just mentioned 'medical personal'.  I believe he may have meant 'medical personnel'.
Mr. Trump just referred to 'medical personal'.  I believe he may have meant 'medical personnel.

Gazette says photo they took of Biden airbrushed and used by Trump campaign without permission
Bernie was robbed (again). Biden won't save it. I am thinking.  I'm thinking of what actually *corrects the problems* that led to tRump in the first damn place, &amp; Joe "Nothing will fundamentally change" Biden ain't it! Neither is whoever they intend to replace him with.
And Biden stops the fire? No, he just pulls a curtain over it. Trump is a symptom of problems that have existed, not their cause. If we allow nothing to change, we will end up with another "tRump" in 4-8, &amp; likely a more dangerous one. Green gets tRump out, too.
Without permission? THAT'S going to be the mistake that costs corrupt traitor Trump the presidency. Get 'em, Cedar Raids Gazette!
You have no idea what you are talking about. President Trump doesn‚Äôt even take his salary. You must be referring to the Obamas who became mult-millionaires in the White House. Trump doesn‚Äôt fly to Hawaii to golf, but I hope he does take a break once in a while, though.
I fear our country and our people cannot withstand another month of trump gop terrors. The pandemic is kicking our ass because the TGOP are obstructing relief efforts at every level.  is out of control. Trump must be unseated somehow.
Our democracy is already screwed up. That preceded Trump, he just made it worse. And we have never been a "great nation". We could be. We should be. But until it's great for everyone, it will never be great.
And yet, you will. And if, by some miracle, Joe manages not to fuck it up (or just hides long enough for Trump to destroy himself), then changes nothing (like he promised his billionaire donors), it will only open the way for another Trump down the road. I accept no blame for it.
Ah, yes, "next time". Literally the argument that we're given every single round. üôÑ  No. We're not giving in just to excuse your weakness, anymore. If you think we were joking when we said "fuck around &amp; find out", you're in for a rude awakening. You want Trump gone? Join us.
So join us in voting Green for policies that actually benefit the People. Then the president would be Howie Hawkins, which also gets rid of Trump. Problem solved. There is literally no argument for capitulating to the duopoly except for fear &amp; apathy. The choice is not binary.
Nancy Pelosi? Seriously?!? She who has approved Trump's budgets, argued against the GND &amp; M4A, let Trump off scot-free from most of his crimes to pursue that joke of impeachment lite? THAT Nancy Pelosi? But, oh yeah, she tore paper &amp; clapped sideways. That helped. üôÑ
Or... We could start saying fuck that &amp; actually voting for our own interests instead of continually capitulating to the corporatocracy. Lesser-evilism is what got us Trump to begin with, but sure, let's continue that losing strategy. üôÑ
...even the best-case scenario (for Trump) would be that prosecution gets deferred until he leaves office, which would still leave him cornered from a legal perspective and raise the likelihood of impeachment.
...Justice Department‚Äôs policy against indicting a sitting president: There is nothing under current law that would prevent a state from charging Trump himself with a crime. Such an action would be unprecedented and inevitably result in a major constitutional showdown, but...
‚ÄúOnce Mueller wraps up his investigation, the path will be clear for bringing state charges against people who have violated state law. This could be bad news for Trump. His pardon power cannot reach state crimes, so there is no get-out-of-jail-free...
Joe Biden will bring lobbyists &amp; bankers to the table, the same as both Clinton &amp; Obama did. At this point, they're literally trying to lose. They have given the People nothing to vote for. All they have is "better than Trump"; a bar so low I'd have to dig a hole to trip over it.
Hey 'Rich' guy!  Why don't you use all that wealth to simply BUY the platform?  I guess you owe FAR TOO MUCH money to DeutscheBank!  #TrumpStain
We've had 3+ years of wishcasting to that effect. Maybe this time the wishes will come true. I'm just suggesting that persons remain calm, in case their dreams of putting Trump in jail don't come true.
Of course, it's possible that the numerous governments have given Trump a free pass until now, or that they just didn't notice massive criminal wrongdoing for decades. Stranger things have happened. But I'd suggest some caution.
New York must already have (or must have had) decades' worth of Trump's taxes. Similarly, the Obama IRS must have had those returns. Many states must have Trump Org returns.  I'd have guessed that if those returns showed massive fraud,  something would've been done by someone.
Interesting that a subpoena that was complied with last year - and regarding which nothing has apparently happened - would make so many persons excited about serious criminal charges.   I'd have guessed that non-action would lead to the opposite inference.
Worrisome... ‚Äúin 2012, Vance ordered his prosecutors to drop a promising criminal-fraud investigation against Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., who were suspected of misleading potential buyers...the order came after their father‚Äôs attorney, Marc Kasowitz, paid Vance a visit.‚Äù
It's a speculation that that is the announcement. But two or more major felonies by two or more conspirators = RICO. Many before me have compared Trump to a mob boss.

Nice grammar and sentence structure. It‚Äôs called leadership and a national plan. Trump has nothing. Other countries were able to get a handle on Covid. We aren‚Äôt.
Idk how you can claim that Trump started family separation when he didn't. You aren't linking any articles to prove that and are making yourself look like a fool.
You've yet to link an article proving any of your claims lol. Find me the article that shows Trump began putting kids in cages. I'll wait.

I don't think so. I think we might flip Joni's Senate seat, and if Kim was up for reelection she'd lose (but she's not) but Trump himself remains fairly popular here.
Biden has always been really unpopular here, even though Obama is popular (Illinois). We almost killed his campaign in the caucuses. Another Dem (Sanders, Warren, Pete) might have had a chance to beat Trump but once Biden was nominated that notion went 100% out the window.
Wonderful. Good way to make sure we get to keep Trump. Vote for nobody. #dontwastetime
It's also a complex question similar to 'have you stopped poisoning cats?'. The two questions: (1) Was the Obama administration engaged in surveillance of the Trump campaign? and (2) If it was engaged in it, when did you become aware of it?

In person because #Trump is delaying the mail after taking over the Post Office. I am concerned about Ivanka having trademarks for voting machines but it seems the lesser of the two evils. So depressing.
Thank God Kanye pulls votes from Trump, not Biden. This is excellent work. They just can't stop the suicide cult thing, can they? #GOP

Fact-checking Donald Trump‚Äôs Axios interview:    #facts #politics
As a person of science who has been paying attention since December I now believe the only way we can survive this is to unseat/remove the prime source of all disinformation, Trump. Iowa Governor adheres to the #GOPTerrorists agenda of obstructing all necessary aid!
Weirded out by how calm folks seem to be about Trump ending the census early so as to enhance already-disproportionate white electoral power. If nothing else there must be some campaigns to get folks signed up that I'm not seeing as a white guy in Iowa, right?
It is so clear Trump‚Äôs campaign team told him that he needs Florida mail in ballots (because they‚Äôre mainly red), so he‚Äôs trying to amend his aimless conspiracy. Like, you can see his political motives so easily it seems that he‚Äôs not even trying to cover them.
An important comparison of where we could be going...Is this the beginning of Trump's Dirty War? by
Interesting. The author notes that this trend seems to be rather new. I hope we don't see a similar trend emerge on the other ideological side (e.g., Trump-appointed judges routinely using judicial opinions to give long, heated essays on abortion and Roe/Casey).
(And, just for the record, I'm skeptical about Trump's authority to turn off payroll taxes, just as I was skeptical about Obama's authority to turn off ACA taxes.)
Trump had previously tweeted about revoking tax exemptions for schools because of their "Radical Left indoctrination" practices.  In response to  request, Treasury/IRS say they have not tried to implement that directive. [No one could've predicted that.]

Trump is already the best President the USA has EVER had.  I love him.
Trump's inability to pronounce "Yosimite" is not surprising.  He reads so little he's never before seen the word in print. Earlier this week he told an interviewer that he's a voracious reader. When asked what he reads he said "Oh everything." Reminded me of Sarah Palin!
Full stop. #TrumpHasNoPlan Actually he does, it is called election fraud, &amp; it's in progress. This is not a drill. Trump said not to trust the mail then gutted the leadership right before a general election. It doesn't take a stable genius to know he's rigging the election.

Trump puts children in cages and retreats this? He sexually assaults women. He's friends with a pedo ring. He has no idea what consistency or values are.

Sooooo....they say Trump is politicizing politics.  Kinda like water is wet.
Trump is evil and everyone knows evil
Has anyone realized, we can not leave the USA, because of our #COVID19 infection rate. We are literally trapped with trump.  But yeah, keep opening the economy and schools. I'm sure "this government" knows how to mitigate a pandemic with 160 thousand deaths so far.

Dude, if Trump is Cancer, Biden is chemo. Not a great thing, as you're essentially trying to kill the cancer before the chemo kills you. But we still need it. At least Biden will know to pick competent cabinet members that won't kill their departments from the inside.

Among the national coronavirus news of note on Friday: A new forecast predicts the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 could hit 300,000 by December. However, that number could be reduced by 70,000 if people consistently wear a mask.
There's a difference though: What we say of Trump is something he hates...the TRUTH.  Trump's statements on the other hand, he's lied so much to us, I am convinced his name isn't actually Donald Trump.
Another campaign rally funded by the American tax payers.  Why is Trump so afraid of women in office?  AOC seems to have taken up permanent residence in his massive brain.

Spurious claims below aside - Take note, blue collar voters: Trump is NOT one of you, never has been, never will be, doesn't want to be; sees himself as aristocracy, smelling a bit sweeter than the plebs. He has always been an elitist using working class prejudices for power.
It is almost like they are deliberately trying to lose this election... what are they going to do next to send more democrats towards Trump?

Following trump's orders by opening schools, kills children &amp; makes the teacher shortage much worse. Everyone following trumps incompetence, because "it's the law," is marching off the cliff knowingly. These are our kids. Stop doing what that fucking moron says.
Absentee ballot already requested, plan to drop off completed ballot early, in person, at county election admin office.  Hopefully safer than Election Day lines &amp; avoids Trump/Dejoy Post Office mail delay debacle which has clearly been set up to suppress votes.
You REALLY think NC, FL, and AZ are going red this year? I could see 1 of those going red, but it's very possibly going to be worse for Trump.

Trump is in charge and botched the pandemic response.  That‚Äôs on him.
The attack took place after Soleimani was killed.  Iran called his bluff and Trump cowered in his bunker.
Meanwhile Trump has done nothing to advance the pro life movement.
Another four years of Trump and the country will be begging for anything else and that includes Marxism.  Biden is not a long term solution but better than what we have now.
And when Iran injured a hundred soldiers in the rocket attack on the embassy in Baghdad...Trump did nothing. Same with North Korea. We have a Code Pink pacifist sissy for president.  North Korea could nuke L.A. and Trump would blame the libs and do nothing

Your missing the point, his actions in signing the civil rights act did more for African Americans than trump has ever done. Nothing about LBJ changes that.  Also trump is the guy you're going to bat for? The guy who discriminated against AA with housing?
So your alternative is the idiot Trump. Fuck you then. I will vote for Joe if he has a gorilla for a running mate.
So Trump says ... Indiana ... has palm trees everywhere.
LBJ's racism is besides the point, him signing the CRA is a far bigger deal than anything trump (the guy that called for the central park 5 to be executed) did.
If they aren‚Äôt voting for trump, they‚Äôre likely aware of the fact the NRA isn‚Äôt the 2nd amendment.
He apologized for that comment.  I've yet to see trump apologize for claiming he's done more for AA than LBJ signing the civil rights act.
Why? When has a VP pick ever mattered before? Everyone in contention has the experience and skills needed.   And ANY vote that's not for Biden is a vote for Trump.
I'm seeing a lot more support for Biden here than Trump. It's annedotal but I wouldn't be surprised to see Biden win by a slim margin.
Yeah I know Trump has done that.  You've clearly missed the point. If you honestly think what Biden has done is worse than trump then you suck at critical thinking.  Trump saying he's done more for AA than LBJ signing the CRA is delusional and offensive.

Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad  #SmartNews
If vaccine is available around the election, Pres-elect Biden will really appreciate all the work that went into making it happen. He may even thank Trump to shut him up and let him snap his suspenders about what a hero he is. Because there‚Äôs work to be done. And SDNY is waiting.
Well, yes. To your point, for a variety of reasons, I'd *expect*, demographically, many felons to vote for Democrats, but, there are more felons from 2016's Trump campaign staffer, than on Secretary Clinton's.

Part of getting older is understanding what battles to choose and also the art of compromise. Is Biden a compromise from Bernie or Warren or Yang? 100%. But it doesn't mean that a Biden admin wouldn't be vastly different from a Trump admin.
I understand the perspective of my young progressive friends who feel like voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump. I encourage you to think about what the next four years will look like under the current administration and ask yourself honestly if you believe that.

Don't debate Trump. He said he didn't want them months ago. Let him implode.  Just keep uniting people Joe so that when this is over we can rebud this nation together. Vote blue early!
Sad part is you‚Äôre mistaken.  America has always been rampant with these issues.  Only before the disease was just corruption and it was all slathered in a veneer of grace.  honestly the US hasn‚Äôt changed much. All trump did was strip the veneer and wallowed in the layer beneath.
Trump is a talking potato. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be prudent to pursue this angle.

Trump said he wasn't doing debates. So Biden doesn't have to do jack - except letting Trump implode.

Trump violated the 2nd Amendment with his illegal bump stock ban. Regardless of how you feel about bump stocks, that was something Congress had to take up and not by EO. Also, Trump has done nothing but provide lip service to the pro life movement.
They can tell it to their priest because I will never believe a word a they say ever again. We have a chain of succession. The mechanisms are there. They had a clear chance in January. 250k dead Americans by the end of the year is on them as much as Trump.
Country over party.  I was looking for change, to me the Obama years weren‚Äôt working. Trump had an opportunity to make history. He did alright and pissed down his leg in the process. You were taken by a progressive liberal NYC con man.
Trump is the biggest whiner of all.  And he hasn‚Äôt done anything to advance the conservative movement.  He might talk tough but that‚Äôs all it is, talk. We are not better off than we were four years ago.

Joe Biden won't be going to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic nomination, while President Trump's considering giving his acceptance speech at the White House.
We don't have Joe's ads here yet. Where Trump's ads left off, Joni Ernst has picked up and started covering.
As if that somehow absolves you from guilt. Stop lying and there won't be a problem. Same with digitally altering Biden photo's and LYING about where they were or what was  happening. If Trump can't win fairly, he doesn't deserve to win. Full stop.
Watched the Dave portnoy interview where he gave trump sloppy toppy for 30 mins
And Trump keeps wishing the accused enabler of child rape well. One that he's been closely tied to for years. When someone lies as much as Trump, you can't believe a word he says.
That part baffles me.  I watch a ton of anti-Trump stuff. Why are you giving me HIS ads, that try to get me to fill out surveys to stroke his ego?  You‚Äôre wasting his ad money, which, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt mind that, but why would you give that ad to ME?
He's a pathological liar. Here's more facts from extremely reputable sources you will deny.
Unless you're talking about Facebook. They don't care what Trump posts. And they've censored pro-Biden posts.
We hope so because Joe is sadly under-represented in the TV ads here in Iowa. Trump has over a dozen/station/day. All lies. Much of rural Iowa relies on TV, especially the news. That's when Trump ads hit.
And Trump and McConnell. She's set women's rights groups back decades.
Fingers are crossed! Believe me, I've argued down Trump supporter numerous times. Trolls are a different story. I ignore them. But a true Trump supporter needs to explain to me (and show evidence) why they should vote for him.

This is the best tweet of the day!  is just running on words; Trump has really taken action on this subject. Building the wall was one of the best actions taken to end this problem. Yet Dems condemned it, but now they want to speak about taking action? ü§î
I think it backfired spectacularly for Trump. Listening to President Obama‚Äôs articulate, passionate speech honoring John Lewis, and then hearing Trump barely able to read the words in front of him. It‚Äôs embarrassing.
You know Trump has no control over postponing the election that would be Congress! He just got you fools trapped into giving him some more coverage! He‚Äôs a few steps ahead of all of you!!
It's been going on way before and will be going on way after Trump

President Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
I can't vote, but with our choices in at peace with that. I'm a conservative, but I don't care for how Trump treats women. And at the same time every time I see Biden groping and sniffing little girls my skin crawls. I don't know how one of those dad's hasn't knocked him TF out.

Criminal Trump ass kisser!
so I get this right, let me recap. Russia has turned to Chuck Grassley with info to help Trump. What happened to you? I guess Russian money. You both need to go!!!!!!!
Trump dismantled pandemic team. That put us way behind recovery. It could be debated if deaths could have been prevented but certainly diminished.
WTF is Trump talking about?   Pre-existing conditions are already covered by Obamacare. It doesn't make sense that he would destroy the ACA, which covers pre-existing conditions, in order to sign an EO guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions.
President Trump said he's not worried about the legality of the executive order.
President Trump announces he's working on an executive order that will require health insurances companies to cover all pre-existing conditions for all customers. He said it could be coming as soon as two weeks from now.
I honestly feel like both sides are taking it down to the wire in a dumb game of political chicken. When passed, the extra $$ will be retroactive. If not, our only other hope is to rely on a Trump executive order.
Just sayin‚Äô.

Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
I fully believe this. Every single thing Trump does is intentional. And if he flubs something silly, like misreading/mispronouncing words of a speech, his sycophants cover for him.

LOL! Try again, felon. His supporters are those afraid of their own shadows because they've never left the state they live in. Probably not even the county they live in. Those who despise Trump are more well off, more educated, and have traveled. A lot. We see why he is a monster

Are we going to talk about the fact that Trump actually just laid a MASSIVE shit on the gaming industry indirectly when trying to get rid of Tik Tok lol
He did not write this because he does not know what he said.  Trump can drive a steam-driven engine through the King‚Äôs English, but at least he doesn‚Äôt portray Black Americans as a simplistic swath of voters who should vote for him because he‚Äôs a D.
President Trump puts pressure on TikTok owner ByteDance to sell. They have 45 days to make a move.

Ronald Reagan massacred the LGBT community with *his* non-response to AIDS, Richard Nixon beat and brutalized his political enemies and minorities with the War on Drugs, and Trump has failed us all by letting 150k Americans die in a preventable pandemic.
Regardless of how ludicrous the smear, it needs to be pointed out that by repeating it, you‚Äôre just furthering the smear and doing Trump‚Äôs propaganda work for him.
Simple question to ask your MAGA friends.   Why does Trump always take the side of criminals?  Examples: -NRA -Ghislaine Maxwell  -Epstein -The people he has pardoned -Putin  They should be able to answer this simple question without blabbing about QAnon conspiracies or Fox News.
Yes and he keeps shuffling through the papers, trying to find one that proves his point. Maybe Trump should go back to school when they open. Then he can test if it's safe!
But will Trump's  appointee do it, probably not because he  works for Trump?!
Of course he didn‚Äôt. Trump team = lies and smears obviously

Today, if you can't decide between Joe Biden and Pres. Trump, stay home on Nov 3.
That looks like Trump mocking someone in a debate.  If he and Biden end up debating (and I think it's doubtful) then we'll probably get to see much more of this when Biden stumbles all over himself.

I‚Äôm worried about the election. My sister meets a lot of people and is saying many are still voting for Trump. You need to get out there more. Do free virtual meetings in diff cities or talk to reporters in every state. Battle Trump‚Äôs daily coverage
A little something to brighten everyone's day:
Republicans that didn't like trump commissioned it, then dems took it over
Trump and the GOP are actively undermining all effective efforts to combat the virus. All facts point to this truth.
Who would have that make America great again was the exact opposite of what Trump had set out to do.
Trump Still Defers to Putin, Even as He Dismisses U.S. Intelligence and the Allies
You will be remembered as a partisan disaster. No statues for you, Trump supporter.
Yes! If they debate, Trump will just spew more lies. I‚Äôve already heard enough to make my head explode. Biden all the way, debate or no debate!
The vote to renominate President Donald Trump is set to be conducted in private later this month, without members of the press present, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Convention, citing COVID-19..
Is Trump slurring his words because he's having a mini-stroke? Is he dehydrated?   As a CNA/PCT I'm trained not to diagnose only bring it to my nurse's attention so she can call the doctor.   I don't see any proof he went to a Walter Reed.
We‚Äôve been asking Trump the same thing for months.
No not really besides Trump just calls everybody names. He never says anything about the plans for the country.
He really said ‚Äúbut y‚Äôall want a guy that be touching kids and is a racist to be the next president‚Äù like that‚Äôs not what Trump is too plus more üòÇ
Ha, you were standing next to Trump there and didn‚Äôt even know it! ü§°
If you call telling the truth corruption then what the GOP and Trump administration as well as Trump himself is doing?, Obviously your idea of corruption and mine are two different things, I believe in what I see and read and you  in what you‚Äôre being told to believe
Are you aware if the fact that trump recently had over 8 tons of items sent from China to his hotels? Did you also know that Ivanka has received 36 patents from China since the orange man moved into the WH?
That's Trump!
What are they afraid of, bad press? What do they expect with Trump? Now what will I have to laugh at and tell at, the lies,nonsense, lack of compassion,blame democrats. It  they don't want it where everyone can see them kiss ass!
I didn't  realize how lucky I was to live in this country until Trump came along, we had problems but not like this. We can defeat him and take our country back!
I am sure you got that from ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù Unlike Billy boy the media would had crucified Trump if this was true.!!!!!
New Disclosures Confirm: Trump Himself Was the Target of Obama Administration‚Äôs Russia Probe

Please.  It's an excuse for the tiny crowd size.  If it had been a TRUMP RALLY, the crowd would have been HUGE.Knoe how people are saying Trump's going to refuse to leave office?  You remember four years ago when people said Obama was going to abuse the constitution to stay in office?  remember 12 years ago when people said Bush was going to use the Patriot Act to stay in office?
Good thing Trump signed an Executive Order allowing me to type this.  #BREAKING
TRUMP
It's August 8, 2020, and Trump is still saying COVID-19 will "disappear".  I guess kinda like the debt that led to his many bankruptcies.
However we can rely on Putin helping Trump. You ok with that? You seem to be.
I would like all the teenagers of Cedar Falls and Waterloo to start collecting Trump signs and painting them and turning them into Black Lives Matter signs and returning them to the racist owners yard
Lol the spike was from Covid related business closures and layoffs- Not Trump. But choose to disregard facts and keep tweeting to your whopping 1 follower man.
My mother told me she wrote all of Trump‚Äôs transgressions into an email to her brother and he wrote back instantly without time to read the email and wrote, ‚ÄúLies.‚Äù Then her sister sent her a message thanking God for Trump during this Covid crisis. #ihateithere
Yeah and Last I check Donald Trump was president in 2019...which was before Covid. Here‚Äôs a chart year by year...unemployment has gone DOWN since trump got in office.
So GOP, still think its ok for foreign countries to interfere in our elections? China wants Trump out...
trump is such a dumbass and if you support him you‚Äôre a dumbass too don‚Äôt even try to argue
Can somebody keep this tweet so when trump loses we can throw it back in GRs face?
Like, her blowing Trump because she got her citizenship is the equivalent of me thanking the prosecutor because I got found not guilty. This video surprises me, because usually people who aren't from this country tend to know more about it.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs crazy‚Äô: Trump brags ‚Äòa lot of people‚Äô have thanked me for fixing showers so they have enough water   #whereIstheWater

The people that don‚Äôt want the debate know that Trump will make more of a clown out of Biden.  If you can‚Äôt see that then you‚Äôre a clown ur self.
I need to be clear on the fact that nothing will have me vote for trump. If Biden come out and say ‚ÄúNIGGA NIGGA NIGGA‚Äù I just won‚Äôt vote at all. MAGA idiots think everytime Biden fuck up it‚Äôs a vote for their overlord
Typical that Biden can get away with implying the African-American reporter should be tested for cocaine use And President Trump‚Äôs economy brings about the lowest unemployment rates for African-Americans and he‚Äôs called the racist.  Something wrong with this picture
someone needs to check into Trump college enrollment. Did he actually qualify, or did his dad pay his way into Harvard?
Trump signals he'll do anything to win the election. Just like his daddy did to get him in Harvard.
Axios interview. Admirable but still no true cross-examination test.  This is like an evasive witness on the stand.  Trump said, "there are good and bad governors, I can tell you."  Interviewer was misdirected.  No, no.  You wait for the BS.  Then ask, what's the list?  CX 101.
Found this brief synopsis of Trump‚Äôs #AxiosInterview .... (it works on a lot of levels.) #Trumpinterview
Senator Kennedy. No one hates President Trump. Hate is a deadly sin for which one burns in hell. I am a democrat and would never hate any President. I don‚Äôt respect his manner of treating the highest elected position in our government but I do pray for him every day.

Can you explain the difference between  death/case and death/population? How one can be low and the other can be high.  Any why Trump is saying we should use death/case and the other guy is saying death/population?
This is such a misleading headline  is a picture of Ivanka Trump with the headline  "Trump gives 35 million to aid human trafficking victims" It was the administration, not Trump.   It was the TAXPAYERS money... HUGE difference
No surprise. A Trump surrogate. She and all other GOP should be tethered to Trump disasters and run out of office. I don‚Äôt see why the Greenfield campaign doesn‚Äôt do this to Trump enabler Ernst.
Trump surrogate. No surprise. All of the Iowa GOP should be tethered to Trump‚Äôs disasterous results and run out of office.

I will never vote for another Republican as long as I live. I dont care what their gender is or how much I like them. Republicans are the party of Trump and that says it all about them. They haved sold their souls to the devil
This new power given to the #Iowa governor to stop our AG, who is a DEMOCRAT and has served for over 30 years, to join other AG's in bringing suits against law breakers is an abuse of power
I wasn‚Äôt aware that Trump had already given his deposition. I‚Äôm not surprised, Bill and Donnie used to be tight.
Have you read Mary Trump‚Äôs book yet?
Vote Greenfield for U.S. senator from #Iowa We deserve better than Ernst who is a Trump enabler and voted against  convicting Trump in the impeachment trials. She had an oath to the constitution. Just think how much better our lives would be if she had followed her oath
Trump would later ban Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the exact timeline‚Äîwhether this was before or after Florida police began investigating Epstein in 2005‚Äîis unclear.
Trump could shoot a member of your family in the face right in front of you and you would still find a way to defend him mom dad cousin auntie I‚Äôm still voting for Trump I love him your voice Uncle C
Who knows if that is the truth or if Trump told that story as a matter of convenience. It was obvious to all that, after Epstein‚Äôs‚Äô conviction, Epstein would be watched. It served a purpose for making THAT the reason, and not saying he was mad about a real estate deal.

And yet Trump continues to worry about his polls.
Every Trump appointee had an agenda to destroy the institution to which s/he was appointed
Just 28% of Iowans approve of Reynolds‚Äô handling of the crisis, good for dead last among all U.S. governors. She is only one of five governors in the country who holds a worse approval on the pandemic than Trump in their state, the poll states..
Trump cant move back the election. That is illegal.  If the Congress changes a constitutional law then we have more than a presidential crisis.

idk how it‚Äôll all go down but Microsoft said they wanted to buy Tik Tok but trump said he was against that so if trump is against a US owned company owning tik tok for no reason , that essentially goes against the first amendment so i meanüòù
It's nice to be informed on what the president is thinking. It's entertaining and Trump actually uses technology in an effective way. It is really really annoying at times, but hey I'll know when we start a war with China or North Korea instantly.
I'm still planning on writing in Andrew Yang for President. Too many people are going to vote AGAINST Trump rather than FOR someone they believe in. Joe Biden doesn't have too many years left, and it's hard to believe that he'll do anything impactful for the future generations.
donald trump will single handedly ruin my mental health if he bans tik tok. that‚Äôs my only coping mechanism
Banning tiktok should be our top priority at this time, good job Trump you're a hero üëèüèΩüá∫üá∏
ain‚Äôt it funny how tik tok has been around for 2 years now and trump is now paying attention to it even though we are in a pandemic

And for that matter when Trump says he closed the border to China saved lives maybe he didn‚Äôt realize the virus was already here so CLEARLY closing the border to China was ineffective and to late Republicans consistently try to let themselves off the hook only to look more guilty

Good luck. She will only do what trump tells her. Instead of leading the country we will be following! Your life is not worth the money someone is giving her is the truth!
Ugh. Living in Iowa has been such a drag lately. After you feel like you survived the Trump news of the day ya gotta fight the Iowa news.
I‚Äôm with Steven Calabrisi. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to call Trump a fascist. He loves other fascists, he supports fascistic policies and loathes democratic institutions. All of these things are objective truths that even his most ardent supporters cannot deny
3 war criminals is all I see. Just like Trump
They should've ran a better candidate then. They didn't learn that lesson this time either but Trump's so bad people will vote for half a bowl of shit.

I sincerely doubt Biden is gonna disappear people in the U.S. This equivocation seems either ignorant or dishonest.
I'm angry at #Biden but I'm still going to vote for him.
This is the best argument I‚Äôve heard for voting for Biden.  Unsurprisingly it comes from Noam Chomsky who is brilliant.

Health care for all (especially during a pandemic) and recognizing climate change would be bad for America? We are the only civilized nation not to do so. You grandpa are to old and feeble to see the future. Biden and Harris will restore the country. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Your head would jerk so fast the other direction if your vaunted police union had endorsed Biden instead.....#defundAOC
One year ago, Kamala "Heels Up" Harris believed Joe Biden's sexual predator accusers. Something changed????
It would be hilarious after Trump said it was unfair to men for Biden to pick a woman that he would dump Pence for Noem.
Maybe with a glass of wine...or a bottle.

This is very important to me. Hey, my portfolio is fine too. It will be fine under Biden. Right is right. I‚Äôve spent my entire life trying, the great majority of the time doing the right thing. The current potus is so far past wrong, the decision is so easy. Some are so selfish.
If your justification for voting is but Biden or but Trump, you have to realize that something is very wrong right?
But but but ... Trump calls on state media like OAN and he runs away--literally--if someone asks a question he doesn't like.  One thing, Biden would never lash out insults to women who ask him tough questions!

1. Well, Biden isn't the president, so endorsing a candidate rather than the one in power sending a Gestapo into his own cities is a little different.  2. I would, too  3. I was without power for half of the week. I'm well aware of the outside world.

Why would they since the Trumper and his GOP are doing a great job helping Biden/Harris get elected.
I agree.  I know they have something planned we are not going to like, because Biden certainly is not it.
I double dog dare the Biden campaign to release this "Parks and Rec" gag prop as a real book. Because I genuinely believe that  could have written 1,001 poems, and that's a positive character trait.
He also admitted to me it was mainly about hurting Biden, I know Kanye himself said it, but it's wild how these guys have zero concience, promoting a Trump admin through sheer manipulation.
I‚Äôm proud of Virginia. Looks like it will go to Biden. Wish I could say the same. My state is so close it‚Äôs embarrassing. The criminal actually leads the pollsü§¨
I do not disagree with you. That person is clearly a fanatic, so I would challenge her to explain why she thinks her 401k will go to crap if Biden wins. My point is that the person is just parroting what Trump says.
I have an idea... let's elect Joe Biden, (and Kamala Harris), instead!  Just an idea.
There's like a 5% shot Biden even knows who this is, right?
I've noticed SO MANY as I've ridden my bike around DSM this summer and they're usually in clusters. I wonder if they're waiting until Biden accepts the nomination, and then they'll accept reality?!

YOU said that Biden choosing Harris as VP would insult men. Are you kidding me? This is another sexist statement out of your mouth. Real men will not say this.

Cool. Go look at them then. Biden's taxes are widely available. Trump's aren't, certainly hiding his conflicts of interest, grifting, and probably years of financial impropriety, if not crime.
Would be cool if she told her impressionable progressive zombies to shape up and vote for biden/harris too

Have to also credit the Biden people for obfuscating the search just enough to make Harris seem like a surprise pick as well.

Joe Biden says no one should go outside without a mask for the next three months.  If you water your lawn you better have a mask.  Wow.  What a cutting edge idea.  I‚Äôm gonna vote for Joe.  He is sooooo smart.Biden actually works, unlike Trump, the yam man, who rambles on endlessly in front of a crowd just to hear the sound of his own voice.

I extremely dislike #Biden and corporate Democrats, However, I'm still voting for #BidenHarris2020 because trump is really that evil.
I sincerely doubt Biden is gonna disappear people in the U.S. This equivocation seems either ignorant or dishonest.
I'm angry at #Biden but I'm still going to vote for him.
This is the best argument I‚Äôve heard for voting for Biden.  Unsurprisingly it comes from Noam Chomsky who is brilliant.
Can‚Äôt decide which DFL quote is better:   ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt able to do questions now because of technical difficulties.‚Äù OR   ‚ÄúAt times I feel like we have one hand tied behind our back in a fight with a guy who‚Äôs fully armed in a way we haven‚Äôt seen before.‚Äù

Well it‚Äôs a good thing Biden doesn‚Äôt unless the mother‚Äôs life is at risk or the fetus‚Äô life is at risk.  In the 3rd trimester, any abnormality results in full medical effort to save both the mother and fetus.  You‚Äôre pretty ignorant,
Health care for all (especially during a pandemic) and recognizing climate change would be bad for America? We are the only civilized nation not to do so. You grandpa are to old and feeble to see the future. Biden and Harris will restore the country. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Your head would jerk so fast the other direction if your vaunted police union had endorsed Biden instead.....#defundAOC
One year ago, Kamala "Heels Up" Harris believed Joe Biden's sexual predator accusers. Something changed????
It would be hilarious after Trump said it was unfair to men for Biden to pick a woman that he would dump Pence for Noem.
Maybe with a glass of wine...or a bottle.
80 days to November 3.  Stay caffeinated!
Trump is the president. He's supposed to be having press conferences. Biden isn't the president....yet. See the difference?

MSNBC, CNN mostly ignore Trump's major Israel-UAE peace deal during prime time. Both networks are increasingly avoiding favorable headlines for #Trump and unfavorable headlines for Biden.  #FoxNews
This is very important to me. Hey, my portfolio is fine too. It will be fine under Biden. Right is right. I‚Äôve spent my entire life trying, the great majority of the time doing the right thing. The current potus is so far past wrong, the decision is so easy. Some are so selfish.
If your justification for voting is but Biden or but Trump, you have to realize that something is very wrong right?
But but but ... Trump calls on state media like OAN and he runs away--literally--if someone asks a question he doesn't like.  One thing, Biden would never lash out insults to women who ask him tough questions!

But it was mild. Just said he was the one ripping off the country in a reply to his tweet which is exactly what he said about Biden. It‚Äôs very weird.
1. Well, Biden isn't the president, so endorsing a candidate rather than the one in power sending a Gestapo into his own cities is a little different.  2. I would, too  3. I was without power for half of the week. I'm well aware of the outside world.

Yes, it is. As soon as Biden is sworn in in January, Trump will be led away in handcuffs.

Why would they since the Trumper and his GOP are doing a great job helping Biden/Harris get elected.
I agree.  I know they have something planned we are not going to like, because Biden certainly is not it.
I double dog dare the Biden campaign to release this "Parks and Rec" gag prop as a real book. Because I genuinely believe that  could have written 1,001 poems, and that's a positive character trait.
He also admitted to me it was mainly about hurting Biden, I know Kanye himself said it, but it's wild how these guys have zero concience, promoting a Trump admin through sheer manipulation.
I‚Äôm proud of Virginia. Looks like it will go to Biden. Wish I could say the same. My state is so close it‚Äôs embarrassing. The criminal actually leads the pollsü§¨
I do not disagree with you. That person is clearly a fanatic, so I would challenge her to explain why she thinks her 401k will go to crap if Biden wins. My point is that the person is just parroting what Trump says.
I have an idea... let's elect Joe Biden, (and Kamala Harris), instead!  Just an idea.
There's like a 5% shot Biden even knows who this is, right?
I've noticed SO MANY as I've ridden my bike around DSM this summer and they're usually in clusters. I wonder if they're waiting until Biden accepts the nomination, and then they'll accept reality?!

So if Biden says I am against abortion, but I am not for forcing my belief on this subject to others (pro choice) is he excommunicated?  Or is ok for all religions to mandate and force their beliefs on others?
She's not my favorite choice and neither was Biden. But everytime the president doesn't like a woman Rep or Dem he calls her nasty. Its obvious :Nasty"means bitch. If she was a man we wouldnt be having this conversation. This isn't presidential.

So Biden just gave the presidency away. Calling it now he wins the the popular vote in a landslide. IF he wins its gonna be close. But the man did say all black people think the same......  Or are we gonna ignore that?
Joe Biden or Donald Trump vs "Titan" or "Gemini" would liven things up this coming political season to be sure
Of course they will. Joe Biden would force them all off their land
As a born and raised Buckeye, the smartest thing that Democrats can do is to nonstop connect Trump‚Äôs handling of the Coronavirus to the loss of OSU football. That will guarantee a win for the Biden Harris ticket.
He goes even lower by accusing her of ignoring the debunked false charges against Biden. (The fact he would go THERE blows my mind!)
The Oval Office occupier accused  of treating  badly during the contest for the Nomination. He claims she "mocked" VP Biden. He is trying to tear her down by throwing around accusations about what her policies will be.
The fact they keep saying we can push Biden/Harris farther left afterwards is absolutely childlike naivety, and really quite insulting, as if the Democratic Party hasn't been telling progressives to fuck off for 4 years.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
I completely agree with you Sam. The only rational thing to do is vote for Biden. That being said I think there are a good amount of actual criticisms one can make against Biden and Kamala, but I‚Äôm still voting for them.
What? You chose Biden, that has to tell you how insane this statement is.
The way you phrased it seemed like you were you blaming people who aren‚Äôt involved in politics for the ticket. Any democrat with half a brain is going to vote for Biden. I assumed you were talking about people not being actively involved and not just like people tweeting lol

I am beyond grateful to the  campaign for affording me the privilege of working, and representing this campaign during the Iowa Caucus. My role going forward may not be needed as much as before, but one thing that‚Äôs for certain is Biden/Harris has my vote &amp; full support.

Congratulations, Biden. You've made Cinnamon Bun angry and swear on the timeline, you asshole.
One: Being better than the nazi candidates is a VERY low bar to meet  Two: There were far more options than just senators.   Biden's biggest weakness is his stance on progressive issues, and he picked the least progressive running mate of the ones being vetted

Karen Bass was contacted by Biden to let her know that she was NOT selected.   I'm guessing an announcement will come at the 5pm EST news cycle for max exposure.  #JoeBiden
Reporters were stationed outside Biden's house (and I think Bayh's house) and there were minute by minute updates on what they were doing in their personal lives.
I am amazed at the response of voters in my state of Iowa. Every week I pass by a house of a person who has always been a staunch Republican. Their yards are always plastered with R. Yard signs. Yesterday I drove by, and saw a United for Biden sign. ‚ù§Ô∏è America is ready for change

I took exception with something posted by a FB friend recently and was piled on by him and another person that I am part of the sheep that follow the communist liberals basically and how Biden will destroy America. No chance of talking reality or logic with some of them.

Same boat, but in reverse.  I think my initial excitement/relief was that at least Biden didn't pick Rice.   Now I'm thinking about her record.   The ticket isn't the one I would have preferred and pragmatism isn't much of a balm.
What's shameful is someone who literally lived in an american concentration camp fighting tooth and nail to protect a system that regularly murders minorities and extorts the poor for basic healthcare. Biden would gladly put you in a private prison if you sneezed on a cop.

Happy to hear Biden went with Harris. She was one of my favorites during the primaries and the dynamic is an interesting echo of that between Obama and Biden insofar that she was a tough critic.

Well then maybe the DNC should have put Medicare for All into the platform, or had Barbara Lee as Biden's running mate, or not had their propaganda arm blackout Sanders then commit a concerted hit on Sanders when the blackout wasn't working, or have Republican lobbyists on DNC...
Bye. Biden/ Harris 2020. The first woman black VP.
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden. Birds of a feather flock together.
Neither does voting.  Progressives are ousting some establishment dems, Sanders took about 30% of delegates, Democrats support M4A at 81%, we're in a pandemic, and Biden still says he'll veto the bill if it hits his desk.
Watch Joe Biden give an endless hug to Hillary Clinton  via    CNN STOCK FOOTAGE LOL. Surprised they haven‚Äôt pulled it yet!!
No, but saw Kamala Harris speak twice in Dubuque and met her at a small gathering after the second event. Heard both her and Joe Biden speak at the Iowa Liberty &amp; Justice dinner. Perhaps next Pres and VP?
Ya, also on  today  and  also criticized Biden for suggesting the mask wearing. Thanks for acknowledging what Fauci said in this tweet.

That seems like a stretch. We can find plenty of ppl in the world far more evil than trump.   Either way, Biden could be considered ‚Äúevil‚Äù. His own VP said she believes his rape accusers and she also called him racist. His VP believes he‚Äôs a rapist and racist. That‚Äôs pretty evil.
This morning I seen  have a video of her tearing up over Biden picking Kamala Harris. I heard other people tearing up. When Kamala gave that speech with Biden Wednesday night I almost had tears in my eyes. That was awesome speech.
I knew when Biden mispronounced Kamala Harris‚Äôs first name I was wondering who was going to mention it. Katie doesn‚Äôt disappoint.
I know you do lol and that‚Äôs okay. Everyone can have their opinion and dialogue is so important. I question whether or not Biden could be any better, that‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt want our generation to continue on with this ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù crap
That‚Äôs your opinion. Can you tell me how Joe Biden is going to make that any better? The man is an outspoken racist and is trying to cover that up to win the black vote.   And I‚Äôm not trying to encourage you to vote Trump lol. I‚Äôm just saying you don‚Äôt have to vote Biden
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick
So then Pelosi becomes President if Biden is removed.
I've gotta' give Biden credit. He's really good at reading a teleprompter.
So when Biden says something that is unpleasant to her to the black community she mentions it. Trump made comments about African Countries S holes and when Trump made comments about Omarosa Harris said nothing. So, ya bias.

He‚Äôs the nominee for the Democratic Party and he just isn‚Äôt on the progressive end.Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that ‚Äúno one will be safe in Biden‚Äôs America‚Äù if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
She sold herself in the debates. And she shouldn‚Äôt outshine Biden over the next 80 days.
You are crazy! Obama, worst President in history. He did nothing! He gave Iran billions in CASH. Wasn‚Äôt even a legal American! He totally divided the country, increased racism ten fold! On and on. Nothing when Biden made huge deals for family, millions with Ukrane and China.
This photo is really popular, it‚Äôs in ads and has been used by the Kamala campaign and now by the Biden campaign.   The guy in the background has not been talked about but he‚Äôs a really great guy, his name is Lemi
This should be Biden‚Äôs go to saying, followed by person, woman, man, camera, tv and drop the üé§
Nothing is more ironic than seeing Trump supporters talking about Biden/Harris/Dems and saying things like "they tell lies" or "can't they be liable for telling lies?" or "fact check showed 5 lies in that speech!"
I believe that I'll be voting for  I keep hearing that we must vote Biden to keep Trump out of the white house. I've struggled with this ideology a lot and it's never rubbed me the right way. I'd much rather vote for something I actually believe in
This is dumb. Biden is up 12 points. Trump is so desperate, he‚Äôs doing everything possible to cheat and steal the election. I would say Biden‚Äôs strategy is working perfectly and he should just keep doing what he‚Äôs doing
IMO, BIDEN AND HARRIS WILL TAKE AMERICA TO NEW HIGHTS!üëçüá∫üá≤  Where does Kamala Harris‚Äôs toughness come from? The two indomitable women who raised her.

There were no alerts. People have lost their homes, have had no power for 5 days now, no cell service, no air conditioning in 80-90 humid weather, some of us don‚Äôt even have water. Be more sympathetic towards us, had nothing close to do with Biden and this other bullshit.

Some of y‚Äôall are convinced Biden/Harris would be just as bad or even worse than our current presidential situation.   Let me make this clear.   Our democracy CANNOT survive another four years of Trumps presidency.

Good job pointing out that we don't agree. You want a cookie? Trump has destroyed our country as anyone can clearly see. Just because you are guessing Biden might do so doesn't mean anything.

I live in Iowa and it‚Äôs trump country. So My vote feels consequential  what would be your advice to me what would be better long term a trump presidency reaffirmed in the middle of world wide protest in support of BLM or joe Biden fmr. Segregationist and Obama‚Äôs VP
I‚Äôm sorry but the Democratic Party isn‚Äôt a person it‚Äôs just a faction of individuals with different interest and concerns and those base voters choose Joe Biden the problem is progressives have more disdain for the base than moderates which why they keep losing primaries
This is what happens when one lives in the extreme: the mean is seen as the opposite extreme. Something slightly more moderate than your extreme is seen as the mean. Thus, Biden is the exemplar for devout Catholicism.
Look at the Russian bots out here  talkin that joe Biden is racist  talk. Like black people don‚Äôt know a old white dude might have been racist (could still be) like that‚Äôs a surprise. All U gotta do is see, who is on who side, and that will tell you who is for U, and against U

I get it. Biden was not my 1st choice-or even my 4th. But the Trump nightmare has to end. I am actively supporting the Lincoln Project, RVAT, Meidas Touch, 43 Alumni for Biden, etc. I believe the president-to whom I try to refer with respect (f/the office)-is dangerously ill.
No.  Its because Biden is stable.  tRump is unstable and somehow his negotiations with China always leaves his own company  without the tariffs he brags about.
GOOD: Biden showcases how wearing a mask doesn't stop you from doing recreational things such as riding a bike.  BAD: No helmet?  I'll admit, I never wore a helmet in my youth, but times  change.  And I guarantee when my wife sees this that'll be the first thing she notices.
Still 55 million less cases than H1N1 during Obama/Biden admin!
Vote.  Campaign for Joe.   Support the Lincoln Project, RVAT, Meidas Touch, and 43 Alumni for Biden.

So if you were in democratic politics you wouldn‚Äôt want to be on the VP list I bet people are begging to be included knowing they not getting picked. Y‚Äôall hate Biden so much y‚Äôall can‚Äôt think straight.
I don‚Äôt really agree that Biden is a bad candidate, relatively speaking. But assuming you‚Äôre right,  there‚Äôs nothing wrong with voting the lesser of two evils. Given the current state of affairs, we could do much worse than Biden.
No.  The Democrats built the economy.   Trump just rode what was in place, until he crashed it.  Now Biden will have to start over
I think this is the right way to go.  You can‚Äôt bully trump. He‚Äôs just gonna do whatever the fuck he wants. But we can bully Biden, break him down, and force him to adopt progressive policies. He‚Äôs already given a few conssesions. It‚Äôs obviously not ideal, but idk what else to do
IMO, There is only ONE who is BAD (Trump) and one who is GOOD (Biden) GO JOE GO!!! üòÉüëçüá∫üá≤üåé
It's literally what they do.  The norms of what are legit accusations to levy at your opponent are out the window with them.  I mean, Trump just accused Biden of trying to "hurt God" yesterday - and the ridiculousness of it aside, that's a really bad thing to say about any one
Your guns will be taken away immediately? By Joe Biden? Who is this raving lunatic?

So...no. üñïüèº  #GoingGreen
Yes. Again, politics is contextual. Biden probably does not make sense in a "normal" political environment. But he makes a decent choice given the political landscape.
That's exactly what the voters are saying. Hence why Biden is up 8+ points nationally.
This is running for POTUS. This is the big leagues. Who gives a shit about some candidate running at 5% talking? We are juggling multiple crises and need the adults in the room to speak. EZ to burn Biden/Trump but their platforms are what Americans want.
Yes., I am aware. I also know that this does not guarantee anything. Biden has run before, and bowed out when he had no shot. So has Bernie. So has Cruz, Rubio, Clinton, etc...It can be true that she has done much for LP and has no shot at winning.
Yes. Biden has been a politician for 3-4 decades. His announcement probably came at the end of internal polling, exploratory committees, and speaking with confidants/ party leaders.
Platforms &gt; People. Biden/Trump having age risk doesn't matter much. This is already baked into the voters' calculus. It comes off as an indictment of JJ. If voters, knowing these old men have this risk, STILL prefer them over JJ, then woof.
my TL is getting a little bit too pro-Biden so i‚Äôd like to remind people Joe Biden has been worse to black people than Donald Trump presently. albeit, not by much.
That's simple. It's the concept of addition through subtraction. Voters feel that removing Trump from office is such a net positive, that other issues pale in comparison. Not exactly an indictment of Biden. Just that Trump is so bad the other issues fade.
Again, it's math. Biden gave the Democrats the best chance with polling among the candidates that ran. Bernie has a ceiling problem, the same problem that Trump has.
Might require a Biden Presidency, too, it‚Äôs not too late to hop on the No Malarky Bandwagon!
That doesn‚Äôt surprise me. It obviously didn‚Äôt fit the caption but people believe anything that fits their narrative, especially when it comes to Biden‚Äôs health
When I say that  is the hardest working volunteer-made-intern-made-organizer I have ever met, I'm not exaggerating. He picked up his life, moved to Iowa, and proceeded to volunteer 70+ hours per week to elect    Team Biden is beyond lucky. LFG!

No way Joe Biden wrote this
After Biden wins, he should use  schedule, and whenever Trump wants to appear somewhere, Biden should make a Presidential visit down the street.  It'll gridlock anything Trump wants to do.  The legality?  The sitting President's security, of course!  Classic!
When Biden wins, he should reduce USPS service to Republican areas to a 5% level from 2017.  Those Republicans aren't objecting when Trump cuts service for political reasons, so they will have no basis to complain!
if you‚Äôre not voting Biden just to stick it to the DNC you‚Äôre a fucking idiot   NO ONE (except old conservative white ppl who pretend to swing liberal) is happy about this, suck it up and have a transition president rather than a (soon to be literal) dictator
And if Trump can unilaterally force a private business like Tiktok to close or divest without Due Process, imagine what Biden could do to all the patents and trade Ivanka does with China!  I mean, game on, right?
Since Trump has already done this, and his party won't condemn him for it, I think the next Democratic President (Biden) needs to take action that hurts the Republican party.  The game is already on, right?
After Trump got elected in 2016, I knew everything would get worse. It certainly has. I have way more confidence in Biden leading our country now than Trump. It isn't close. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica

I‚Äôd like to say, i‚Äôm disappointed about the VP choice. But, I‚Äôm also disappointed about Biden. Both seem like half-assed attempts at being a democrat. I‚Äôm done with the party, they‚Äôve failed me, &amp; others.  That DOESNT mean I won‚Äôt vote for them. I am not stupid. #SettleForBiden

Really glad I watched the Biden/Harris event - it‚Äôs a great pair of speeches, especially from Kamala, and it made a nice, neat case for why they work well together. Neither were my first choice for either role, but I feel really good about this ticket.

It's so nice hearing Biden and Harris speaking like real leaders rather than ranting about toilets and endorsing food products.
Biden and Kamala are nailing this event IMO. Very, very excited for their White House.
why must joe biden have press conference while i am trying to watch jeopardy????? i am OPPRESSED
Or when they try to say Biden isn't mentally competent. Meanwhile, their guy can't form a coherent thought.
Biden is so much better when he gets mad. It clearly focuses him and reminds him of the stakes of the situation. Even in this speech he improves the second the topic turns to trump. I think he‚Äôll kick butt in that debate.
Biden kind of has the founding father look going on with the white hair.
Same for Biden. Says a new racist thing every week. Black people ain't black, poor kids are just as bright as white kids, etc.
Why won't Biden debate Trump?
Voting for Biden/Harris is like paying an insurance bill. You don‚Äôt WANT to do it, cost is high, payout is low, the ppl in charge are rich corrupt sleaze balls, you know it‚Äôs a scam that only makes THEM richer, but if you DON‚ÄôT do it, ur fucked. This is democracy/capitalism üôÉ
I didn‚Äôt vote for Kamala. I think some (not all) of the critiques of her track record are warranted. That can be true AND I can be happy Biden picked her over others. I can think critically about her politics (as we should for all politicians) AND appreciate this historic moment.
Yeah, that's gonna be a 'No' from me, brah. I can't vote for Biden if he won't debate Trump.

the candidates need to earn the vote of the ppl then. instead of ppl shaming those with criticism of the candidates. we should show them how they have changed. but ignoring criticism adds to toxic rhetoric. i already plan on voting for biden/ harris.

It‚Äôs hardly the number one reason to vote for them, but Biden-Harris is one of the most religiously diverse tickets ever. Harris is Christian but grew up with heavy Hindu influences and her husband and children are Jewish. Biden would be the second Catholic President.
This suburban housewife is voting for Biden and Harris because I want equity in our schools so I want low income housing scattered around town instead of concentrated in a few schools. #VoteBidenHarris2020
It‚Äôs ridiculous that we actually have to make a law like that. Trumpmerica Gone Wild. Biden/Harris.
You should know by now that politicians will say whatever they think will gain votes. What they do with power is the true test. Both Biden and Harris failed those tests.
This is why Biden/Harris 2020 is the deal. They will be able to be held accountable in ways Trump (so far) has managed to run away from faster than we can sue him.
LOL. Biden also believes in jailing nonviolent drug offenders. What do you say to those people?  Regardless, both admins will continue bombing brown people across the globe. Supporting the USA empire is immoral. Undermine it instead, through agorism.
What do you think of Biden's choice of  Join me at noon #RivertoRiver  for analysis from political scientists  and Donna Hoffman
For example - Trump may try to declare victory on election night even when there are many absebtte ballots left to be counted in key states. But that will be much harder to do if those states with outstanding ballots are already reporting for Biden.
Plus she and Biden despise each other
It's never been a binary choice. Your lazy acceptance of such does not make it fact.  You claim you supported Bernie. Why? Policies, right? (Just like rest of us) So how precisely does Biden benefit you? He doesn't. Electing Hawkins gets rid of Trump, too, &amp; gets the policies.
I'm gonna listen to my Black, queer, fat,  nonbinary, deeply informed friend on this one, but I guess y'all progressives who think you know better, go off. üòÇ Biden ain't great, but at least he listens to the country. Kamala is a solid pick, and either way, Trump is outta there.
There should be a reporter in the same room as Joe Biden sleeps in tonight. When he first wakes up, the reporter should ask him if he remembers who he nominated as his VP today. Would he answer correctly?
Is that seriously all you people can do? Spew Party propaganda &amp; talking points? Let's try something. WITHOUT MENTIONING TRUMP, tell me what a vote for Biden/Harris is actually a vote FOR (not against; for). They've already turned down every policy that the People support.

Wow. It seems that Joe Biden is more Catholic than you claim to be. #nograceatall
The only thing conceivably better than this country getting to tell  "you're fired" in November is doing so with a landslide victory for Biden &amp; Harris with a margin so large, so huge, so beautiful.  The biggest margin.  Man.  Woman.  TV.  Camera...
For everyone on the left saying Ds should just nominate whoever b/c look Rs are calling Biden and Harris socialsts etc. anyway - the problem isn't what Rs say but how it sticks. And it doesn't stick for either candidate (esp. while trying to paint Kamala as a cop also)
The Harris-Biden debate, in fact, is going to be boring
progressives trying to be enthusiastic when they go to the polls to vote Biden/Harris
Biden has 570k+ likes on his Kamala Harris announcement. How does it feel to know that in less that an hour more people said fuck trump with a like. Far more than your supporters have liked any of your tweets to date?
Settle for Biden and you will lose the respect of myself, and countless other freethinking black people in the world. Stop.
If you vote for Biden/Kamala. You are not allowed to vocalize support or allyship towards BLM or any other people of color. You are on the same level as those who vote for Trump/Pence. Please vacate.

I can't say I'm surprised by Biden's pick of Harris for his running mate, but I don't think it was the pick that would be the best for his campaign.
Of all the possible people he was looking at down the final stretch, I think this was probably the right pick - she‚Äôll be a great campaigner, a good VP, and she‚Äôs well positioned to pick up the torch when Biden‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm happy with this.
I love the Kamala Harris running mate selection from Biden
My hot take: The benefit of electing "mainstream" or "centrist" Democrats is that if you've pushed the party left in the meantime they'll tend to reflect the work that you did, and their reputation can serve as cover for your agenda. Thus Biden running left of Obama, Clinton, etc
Gentle reminder that either Biden or Harris would‚Äôve let fewer than half as many citizens die since March
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be a solid team and a necessary counterpoint to 'Starchy and Husk' aka Trump/Pence.  It has been an exceptionally long few years and government doesn't work when  authoritarians are at the helm. A good team is neded.. Harris is a very good choice.

This is about the normal time a VP is announced.  But this isn‚Äôt about that. The only thing that matters is the math. Biden‚Äôs got scoreboard. Jorgensen‚Äôs got excuses.
So how many of the silent majority are going to take part in these polls? Of course Biden is leading in every poll, no republican is picking up the damn phone ü§£
Couldn't care less. There is not a single thing the media can bring out about Biden that will be even come remotely close to the least-terrinle thing Trump has done.
Of course, that assumes Biden wins.  Being the VP candidate on a losing ticket might not do much for career advancement, so it depends a bit on how confident one is of victory.
Brown's basic argument in this article is that the VP is a dead end job and Harris could do more as AG or some other cabinet position. It's possible, however, that Biden's VP might be a more important job than many expect.
Donald Trump &gt; Joe Biden. Is it really much of a compliment? I don‚Äôt care. They both suck.
Also how are your states being run? Look at the southern states. They take more money from the federal government than California. Also why are your states always ranked lowly? Biden most definitely knows where he is. He might just misspeak, but he‚Äôs very intelligent.

Were there any Biden boat parades today?  I didn‚Äôt think so.
Biden's been touched by these issues personally, having lost his first wife and daughter to a car crash. Based on that and his record, I'm optimistic about what his administration would do on auto safety.
The Sting Ray is sweet, and the ad is cool. While Biden can drive stick, can Trump even drive?  The Sting Ray predated NHTSA; we can't hold classic cars to the safety standards of today. Of course, no one does‚Äîbut nor do they try to shame those who drive them. Worth pondering.

If I were Biden, I'd shut down this whole conservative "Harris called out his racist policies" talking point like this: "Hell yes she did and was right. I want that kind of voice helping me lead and that's why I chose her. Unlike Trump, I prefer criticism to boot licking."
How are we doing right now? Basically Trumps only message is that if we elect Biden the country will still be better off than it is under Chump? Works for me and 70 million others.
Democratic ticket announced this week, not lost on Republicans -&gt;  Iowa GOP Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann at Pence event:   ‚ÄúIf there is anything that keeps me up at night‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the thought of a clueless Joe Biden and a California left-winger at the head of this country‚Äù
Looks like Biden-Harris are locking down the Hindu vote
Reminder: President Trump carried Iowa by 9 points in 2016. Some counties voted twice for Obama and then flipped. Republicans swept the state legislature that year, too.   Now polls show a tight race here between Trump/Biden. This is Pence's third trip to IA since May.
And I‚Äôm not excusing Biden but when someone only hammers one side I feel the need to point it out
When  is too scared to tell Iowans she supports her own Dem ticket, I guess that should tell you just about everything you need to know about how well Joe Biden is doing in Iowa.
One more thing;  Establishment conservatives/liberals. We have seen your hand. This poker game is over. You win. However, It has cost you the future. A real progressive party is coming after election.  I will vote Biden, stop asking for $, go ask your criminal corporate donors.
To #MAGA, #Trump2020, #QAnons or whatever your name is. GET THIS STRAIGHT! #Biden is a Lincoln conservative. #Harris is liberal-ish?  Your conservatives, have flooded the  Aka "New Republicrat Party"  Progressives will help #JoeBiden, while we form a real progressive party.
Do they think this will be a negative to anyone who was considering voting for Biden, or is it just more drum up the base?
Kellyanne Conway complained yesterday that instead of criticizing Trump‚Äôs handling of the pandemic he should share his own plans. Biden has done so repeatedly:  facial coverings, social distancing, unified messaging from the WH and ample testing. He repeated it yesterday! Duh!
Every Democrat in America rushed to praise the Biden-Harris ticket, yet we've heard nothing from    Has word not reached her windowless basement yet? ü§î #IASen
I haven‚Äôt had one with a Biden supporter. How can you if they are dumb enough to be supporting an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient that can‚Äôt speak more than 2 minutes
Kamala Harris' Favorability Rating Higher Than Trump, Pence and Biden's: Poll
The point is Biden made a big stink about his VP being AA female to gain votes. Says he will represent AAs. She‚Äôs not, he didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs all so phony and pandering for votes.  I don‚Äôt care either. #Trump2020
YOU said that Biden choosing Harris as VP would insult men. Are you kidding me? This is another sexist statement out of your mouth. Real men will not say this.
That fact that we've seen Biden in office for decades is all the reason I need to vote for the other guy.
Her mother chose Kamala‚Äôs name as a nod both to her Indian roots. Kamala means  lotus &amp; is another name for Hindu goddess Lakshmi and the empowerment of women.   #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Biden for President statement on Mike Pence‚Äôs visit to Iowa today &gt;&gt;
Yeah! Really United! 46 days ago, Kamala nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies ‚Äî noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden‚Äôs racist actions were thrown out the window...
Wasn‚Äôt this you?  Oh, by the way! 46 days ago, Kamala nearly choked up on the debate stage, attacking  for his racist policies ‚Äî noting the personal impact they had on her childhood.  But the door to power swung open, and Biden‚Äôs racist actions were thrown out the window
I'll tell you what's nuts.  The ghost of Herman Cain is tweeting about the Biden/Harris ticket.  That beats Mr. President yelling at cable news all morning, and Betsy DeVos ordering her yacht crew to fire up her internet machine.  Herman Cain is tweeting from the great beyond!
She's awesome. A great, stark contrast to what we have now. The same with Joe Biden.
Tucker Carlson endorses Joe Biden!
&gt;Push for criminal justice reform &gt; vote for Biden/Harris   You must pick one. You cannot have both.
Yes, we get it. Joe Biden sucks. Not voting for him is still stupid.

Biden and Harris spoke Wednesday at a high school in his Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
Makes us wonder how many of these Biden/Harris bashing accounts are fake
If you vote for Joe Biden your Voting for Communism In America , Which is very Disrespecful to our Vets ,  can back this up and   am I right #Trump2020
How many of those has Joe Biden ‚Äúsniffed‚Äù? Of those, how many did you SAY you believed and then discarded when they had no further political value for you?  Asking for a Nation...
It is true tho. Biden and Harris both üöÆ but ima vote for em as well. #lrt
Martha &amp; Snoop‚Äôs Potluck Dinner Party but it‚Äôs just creepy Biden feeding Kamala roofies and unwanted butt pats.
The Joe Biden campaign said it more than doubled its previous one-day fundraising record after announcing Kamala Harris as his running mate.
He better hope he doesn‚Äôt get elected - if he does he won‚Äôt last a month. Actually, after Trump is elected, Biden will immediately disappear.  They will find him in a nursing home somewhere.
Random 11:16pm why can't I fall asleep thought: If Biden wins, what will happen to the Space Force do you think? ü§î
This is your choice Trump or Biden ? The change comes from all of us . Vote the responsible people in the congress.
The last election had more to do with a hatred of Hilary vs people liking Trump. That same hatred does not exist for Biden.
Join me in supporting Joe Biden via
Amen! Go team Biden/Harris! I am so excited, I am counting the days.
YOU are lower than whale poop on the bottom of the ocean floor. YOU are trying to make that postal service less efficient with the hope of the many votes for Biden/Harris don't get counted. YOU and Pence have your hands full w/ Harris. She will eat you guys up!!!
Tronsot should run the Biden campaign
Biden wins by doing absolutely nothing!
I hate Trump so much but Biden is such an easy victim
I've seen 2 Trump signs. That's it.  One was on a farm fence. The other was a Trump flag across someone's front door. But, I've seen a lot of Biden signs.
This. Is. Brutal.
I had such hope for Beau Biden being President in about 2032. Damn. SUCH a loss to all of us!
Second stimulus check: Where Biden, Harris stand on COVID payment proposals
Biden goes to church on Sundays &amp; prays, Trump golfs! Then there was this too...when asked if that was his Bible he was holding he just replied "it's a Bible"
I'm going to try to make up a conspiracy theory here: "Lizard people sabotage radio telescope to prevent people realizing that they are importing aliens to vote for Biden/Harris."
If you aren‚Äôt excited about the Biden/Harris ticket, then just understand that trump MUST lose!
I enjoy watching the right pretend Trump is not President. How about this? You were given 4 yrs to show you could handle important business and you messed up-AGAIN. You offer nothing but excuses. Biden-Harris in 2020.
Some of y‚Äôall really see people criticizing Biden/Harris and the first thing that comes to your mind is ‚Äúso you‚Äôre telling us to vote for Trump‚Äù..............
1) Biden/Harris announcement  2) Scotland train derailment 3) 1100 new cases of COVID-19 in NC 4) return to learn impacts.   That‚Äôs just the A-Block
So if Biden says I am against abortion, but I am not for forcing my belief on this subject to others (pro choice) is he excommunicated?  Or is ok for all religions to mandate and force their beliefs on others?
She's not my favorite choice and neither was Biden. But everytime the president doesn't like a woman Rep or Dem he calls her nasty. Its obvious :Nasty"means bitch. If she was a man we wouldnt be having this conversation. This isn't presidential.
-AOC given 60 seconds to speak -Andrew Yang not given speaking spot -denied Young Turks press pass -Kasich has speaking spot -Harris/Biden ticket
I‚Äôve seen a couple castrate/kill pedophiles posts circulating here and on Facebook in the past week and I‚Äôm sorta wondering where that came from. I feel like it‚Äôs a 2 part interactive social campaign and the next part is evidence that Trump or Biden are pedos.
Hillary Clinton or her good family friend and donor Donald Trump were not acceptable options in 2016 and voted 3rd Party.  Seeing what Trump has done the last four years it‚Äôs apparent he is not a choice this time around either. I‚Äôm voting Biden/Harris in November. #LincolnVoter
That‚Äôs a good thing, isn‚Äôt it?  ‚ÄúTucker Carlson warned his viewers last night that if Biden is elected, everything Trump has done to this country will be reversed! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù
Joe Biden is a radical leftist? And yet he‚Äôs opposed to Medicare for All?  Show your work and back up your argument because it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt stand on its own.
running Biden and Harris because Sanders or hell even Warren are too "extreme" meanwhile media has already painted both Biden and Harris as revolutionary Marxists
I heard Beau Biden speak in an Iowa backyard over 10 years ago introduced by  and I thought he would run for president one day. After today's speech by  he is on the ballot in a sense. Photo for  in 2019.
You would think all Biden/Harris would need to do would be to just give speeches that are inspirational and coherent a few times a week with decent coverage and that should nail the win. #BidenHarris2020
All of the women on Biden‚Äôs potential V-P candidate list have outstanding credentials. All of them are a major improvement over what‚Äôs been going on with the executive branch since 1/20/2017.
That was a great get-together.  Biden and Harris are definitely on their A game.
Our power is out so I couldn‚Äôt watch the rollout but it sounds like Biden‚Äôs speech went well.
No crowd, plenty of history as Biden introduces Harris  (from
I agree with most of what you said. But, dems made her ethnicity and gender an issue when Biden said he would pick a black female.  They grandstanded on the importance diversity and promised to represent black Americans.  That goes out the window when they pick an Indian/Jamacan

Why are none of the pollsters tracking the boater vote? Trump appears to be *WAY* ahead with the boater vote. I've yet to see a Biden Boat Parade.  Because, MAGA, or whatever.  #RidenWithBidenAndHarris2020
This is Joe Biden's party now. No one should be surprised.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
I trust the Biden/Harris Ticket. I am voting a straight Democratic We need it.üóΩü¶Öüá∫üá∏üôã
I just said she's not "helping with the progressives" - because most of the progressives I know (Warren supporters) are not thrilled. But they also were (for the most part) determined beforehand to vote for Biden regardless of who he picked. I can't speak for Bernie fans.
I like the Kamala Harris choice because I feel like if Biden fucks up and does something creepy she'll throw his ass in a retirement home and get the job done herself.
Okay, I fucking hate Biden and Harris but you know that's the pair I'm voting for. I'm sad too but can you stand another 4 years of whatever the fuck THIS was?
Far from my first choice for the ticket but this video has me hyped to vote for Biden/Harris in November.
as someone that has not been hyped to vote for Biden this announcement and video has gotten me hyped
If biden were to adopt these 2 bills as planks in his platform it would garauntee him the election
*checks notes* Under the rules... that means you should be voting for Biden/Harris. At least, I hope you'll consider it.
That right there, tells you everything you need to know about   party. Not being sarcastic, just literal. Oh, &amp; shut up about joe, of course we're voting for Biden. Quit being dicks about it, you're scaring potential votes away. Honey not vinegar.
Also pretty surprised at Gov. Kelly's approval compared to Biden.
Biden being perceived as moderate gives cover for his campaign to move left. In the way that some said only Nixon could go to China, Biden may have room to welcome in the more progressive wing as he keeps the party together.
Ummmm, ah, Sir? There's no sleep, no rest, none, till Biden/Harris. There's a republic to save.
The annual event will be adapted to meet social distancing guidelines, and masks are required to move outside vehicles.
"Biden‚Äôs biggest advantage over Trump is the perception that he can bring people together. I suspect the Harris nomination is designed to help him make that case more strongly," writes
Dude, I wish Biden/Harris were as radical left as they‚Äôre being made out to be in these ads. Direct action in the streets is still our best option for progress &amp; change in this country. Keep electing true leftists into office, &amp; continue the fight regardless. The people will win.
Biden wasn't even in my top ten Democratic candidates. I'm not saying he's a great or even a good candidate. It's a binary choice now and for me the choice is easy. You may prefer to indulge a sense of moral superiority. Remember RBG will not make it through another four years.
It's not an excuse to point out that Bernie was wrong to it vote for it (especially because he said at the time he disagreed with the vast majority of the provisions of the bill) but Joe Biden is more wrong for writing, championing, and bragging out the bill.
If you can't see why Biden is the lesser evil then I can't help you. Enjoy your feeling of superiority when Republicans keep packing the courts.
I'm saying "it's ok" in the sense that many many many many many Bernie fans make excuses for that vote. Yet for some reason it's a deal breaker and they are too morally pure now to support Biden against fascism.
Republicans want to help a black guy who has admitted he wants to hurt Biden. Keep up.
It's not okay! He has faced a lot of criticism for his vote and he has always acknowledge that it was a flawed vote for a deeply troubling piece of legislation that Joe Biden *wrote*! No one gave him a pass for it!
I'm voting for Joe Biden because I have to but I'm Voting for Kamala Harris because I want to
It's a bait and switch. Biden will step down sometime in his first term, and Harris checks the right identity boxes to carry the left's agenda forward as president.
He will get my vote given the alternative, but I just can‚Äôt get excited about Joe Biden being the democratic nominee... I would love to hear honest opinions from legit Biden supporters on why he‚Äôs their guy?
You got us fucked up if you do... he admitted he was running to divide Biden votes giving his best friend TRUMP votes... smh you feeding into his delusion and gonna fuck us over more than we are rn
This article helped me understand some of the issues people are having with Kamala re transgender rights.

I‚Äôm so pumped for Biden/Harris!!! Most progressive ticket ever! #VoteBidenHarris2020
Lol the Dems really think we‚Äôre all going to get cozy with them &amp; be complacent if Biden/Harris wins in November. A rude awakening is heading their way; these protests won‚Äôt stop, the movement won‚Äôt slow. We‚Äôll just fight that much harder for progress. We gotta put the foot down.
I literally LOL when people assume that liberals think Biden will be a good president. We know he‚Äôs shit, love. Literally nobody has any genuine support for him. We think the whole system is trash. Find a different argument.
I understand what you‚Äôre saying - but if elected she‚Äôll be in position in 2024 to be at the top of the ticket. Personally I don‚Äôt see Biden running for a second term.
‚ÄúWhen I vote for Biden and Harris, I‚Äôm voting for my family to securely continue our long lineage as family farmers. Biden and Harris have a vision for rural America that I‚Äôm proud to embrace.‚Äù
We don‚Äôt know. We have to wait until November 3rd to find out. I think Trump could win another term and I also think Biden could beat him. We won‚Äôt know for certain until it happens.

Feel like I really missed out on the VP discourse because my fucking power has been out for 2 days now but I just wanted to say fuck kamala harris fuck joe biden fuck and fuck the democratic party that‚Äôs making me vote for them
I'm so old, I remember that only Nixon could go to China.... so, I'm gonna vote for Biden and his running mate in order to end the current nightmare.
No matter how much you Bernie Bros may not like Kamala Harris because she can't pass your precious purity tests you have to concede at least one point: Joe Biden is much worse.
Yesterday, Democratic nominee Joe Biden chose Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP for the November ticket. Find her bio, voting records, positions, ratings &amp; endorsements, statements &amp; funding HERE:  #KamalaHarris
For those of you keeping score at home: the waves of dissonant bullshite coming from the Party of Trump over the "inadequacies" of the Biden/Harris ticket are a sign of how utterly panicked they are by that ticket. They understand, they're losing.  #TrumpHasNoPlan #TrumpIsLosing
Obama/Biden?
My number 1 hope for a Joe Biden administration is cross-country high-speed electric trains. Let's make this happen. #zeroemissions #noplanes #seethecountry
Biden and Harris will appear together Wednesday at a high school in Biden‚Äôs Delaware hometown to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
The problem with electoral forecasts is that it can't take into account late-breaking events such as Clyburn endorsing Biden. You always need to bake in some uncertainty for those situations.
I really like Joe Biden's choice for a running mate!
Hi Gabrielle, hope all is well ma‚Äôam.  Saw the discussion on SWs reacting to Harris as VP for Biden. There won‚Äôt be a sweeping roundup of SWs, the issues we are facing right now are far more pressing. Besides, Trump has done far more damage.
I stand behind my assessment that Joe Biden will not be on the final ticket in November - and that Hillary is out there waiting in the wings #Election2020
Joe Biden being ‚ÄúJoe Cool‚Äù üòé
Shout out to  who on Monday morning submitted a post on how VP picks affect presidential races. I was copy editing when the derecho hit and we lost power. Dan revised the text to take into account Biden's pick, &amp; I'll publish in a few (from outside a coffee shop).
I posted an 18 minute video of Biden‚Äôs gaffes
Biden can‚Äôt go 2 minutes without being racist or coherent
I did answer. He makes an occasional gaffe but he isn‚Äôt completely demented like Biden. He can speak on stage for 2 plus hours. Biden can‚Äôt go 2 minutes
Might be meh about Harris; still going to vote for Biden. Also: I‚Äôm not suddenly wearing a MAGA hat because I‚Äôm not ecstatic about our Democratic candidates.  Absolutism is the language of the party we‚Äôre trying to beat, and it‚Äôs disgusting when I see it in our own.
Yeah I don‚Äôt see anyone switching from Biden to Trump. But I can see people who were going to vote for Biden no longer vote at all bc of Harris. I hope not tho
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so horrible, but I do believe enough of these tweets gon lead to mfs not voting at all. Bc not everyone can think for themselves. I have seen people already saying they not voting at all(and they HATE trump) so in some cases, it can work against Biden/Harris
I‚Äôd prefer to judge her on what she can bring to the table as VP instead of racial background.  Considering that is competence and intelligence, it just further cements I‚Äôm voting for Biden and her.
and a majority of Americans know Joe Biden is who we need as President to repair the damage of the last 4 years
Whataboutist much? Fuck Biden
Hell no I want to see Joe Biden DEBATE TRUMP
Biden is not anti integration today.  Doesn't respect women? Writer of the VAWA?  üôÑüôÑüôÑ
There's progress forward with Biden who would be tougher on tackling pandemic &amp; he would listen to progressives.  Trump won't do either.  Everyone else is not in a position to make a difference.
Same boat, but in reverse.  I think my initial excitement/relief was that at least Biden didn't pick Rice.   Now I'm thinking about her record.   The ticket isn't the one I would have preferred and pragmatism isn't much of a balm.
Watching this put into words why I was so emotional when Biden announced his VP pick. My eldest son couldn't contain his joy &amp; I fought back tears becuz I am a strong woman in a male dominated field &amp; had been thrown under the bus at work and was needing a reminder of my strength
What's shameful is someone who literally lived in an american concentration camp fighting tooth and nail to protect a system that regularly murders minorities and extorts the poor for basic healthcare. Biden would gladly put you in a private prison if you sneezed on a cop.
Too bad Biden just nominated one to be VP ü§∑
Trump, Biden who cares? Two bowls of dried out old shit the only difference is the smell.  I thought Vixen was talking Trump.   Even if Repubs lose the house and chunks of the senate, Washington will still drag it's bloated ass to get ONE thing done. NO THING.  Stimulus 2 anyone?
More tangibly, suppose (pulling this out of thin air) that "Joe Biden" is more common on adversarial writing, "Biden" on neutral writing, and "Joe" on friendly writing. The form you limit yourself could exhibit such biases.
If you just use [last] or [first], you might run into misattribution and other biases. For instance, Biden is usually referenced by last name but Harris by first name. There could be a bias behind the reason or behind using the less common form.
As we get closer to debate season, I want to remind everyone of this article. Say what you want about Joe Biden, but think about if what you‚Äôre saying may be deragatory towards the stuttering community. Also it was so cool to meet  via zoom yesterday with  :)
I‚Äôm not asking about trump. We shall see in the debates
Here's an inside look at the vetting process that led to Joe Biden picking Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.

I didn‚Äôt get to go to my grandpa‚Äôs funeral and I literally have nightmares about going to the grocery store, pls vote for Biden and contribute to or volunteer with local candidates or organizations you like more!
The people had her and went with.... Joe Biden
Fair enough. Neither she or Biden were in my top 5 of the field.
hey, you can like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or you can not but please vote for them in November because I am at least optimistic enough to believe they care if the pandemic keeps killing us all and it‚Äôs clear that Trump doesn‚Äôt
It‚Äôs lies like these that make me feel sick to my stomach. Derecho happened yesterday but lies are being told that it happened as soon as Biden announced his VP?! Like some sort of Biblical warning?? You are a false prophet ma‚Äôam.
Joe ‚ÄúWhat Are We Doing With Our Hands?‚Äù Biden
Any Biden supporters/Anti-Trumpers wanna explain this one, or we just gonna stick with ‚ÄúOrange Man Bad‚Äù all the time? Call it both ways, and demand better candidates.
I‚Äôve been so zoned in on storm coverage that I didn‚Äôt even notice all of the Tuesday news dump around me   -no big ten football - as Biden‚Äôs VP pick  Did I mention today is TUESDAY and this week has been as long as 2020 has
Joe Biden would be a better President than the current ONR. That‚Äôs the choice you have before you.
This is delusional. Biden May well be a one term president. To ignore the incredible damage a second Trump term would do so you MIGHT get a candidate you like in 4 years is immoral.
There is no progress possible in the current structure. Biden is a better chance. These things aren‚Äôt easy. Do the politics but sitting on your hands at this point is a moral choice. Too much is at stake.
Sure. He said that in the primary. And his decades long career has been about making deals. You‚Äôre not going to get M4A from Trump. If you want it, get Biden in office with a Democratic majority in both houses, and apply pressure. Do the politics.
With a gun to my head I'd vote for Hillary before Kamala Harris.   She's a wannabe tyrant who will do anything for power.  Biden better hire a food taster.

Joe Biden selects Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate today
Joe Biden could have picked John Kasich for VP &amp; called it a ‚Äúunity ticket‚Äù and the Trump team/Republicans would have said it represented a radical socialist takeover of the USA. They‚Äôve got nothing. #KamalaHarris  #BidenHarris2020
Pro tip: with a Biden/Harris 2020 ticket, the Dems have effectively said NO to cannabis legalization.
Jill or Hunter Biden
take: The selection of dynamic and path-breaking Kamala Harris shows Biden is confident in his own skin.
I‚Äôm so disgusted and torn over this whole thing. For all the obvious reasons. Only time Kamala shined was her grilling of the piece of hair encrusted shit, Kavanaugh. She‚Äôs still a fking cop and Biden is expertly using her as a pawn to keep the status quo bc she‚Äôs a Black Woman.
She‚Äôs not going to help you outlaw abortion or gay marriage, so you would never vote for her anyway.  Don‚Äôt worry about it.  If Biden loses, it won‚Äôt be because of her. It will be because of the American voters.
I pledge that I will commit to do WHATEVER it takes to putting Biden/Harris in the PEOPLE‚ÄôS HOUSE.  Who‚Äôs with me?
And to think she accused Biden of being racist and out of touch...ü§î
Lol...please Mr. Russian bot. Quit passing yourself. Biden picked the woman who beat him in a debate. That tells you what kind of person they both are.
In a time with black lives matter saying defund the police. Biden chooses a cop as his VP. Really stupid.  Should have been    But.... Biden would never choose Nina Turner as VP. That would make too much sense and get Bernie people to vote for   #BidenHarris
President Trump wasted no time attacking Sen. Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. But in 2014, he was donating to her political campaign.

So it begins...! Trump attacks Kamala Harris over Kavanaugh hearings in first remarks since she was named Biden's running mate
When was this? Biden certainly never nailed anything in 8 years with Obama....
When was this? Biden certainly never nailed anything in 8 years with Obama....
Also, I do think it‚Äôs important to draw this distinction: Kamala Harris never accused Joe Biden of anything. She said she believes the women who have done so. Might seem like a small difference, but it leaves quite a bit of grey area where they could have found common ground.
Influential Iowa activist (obviously  calls Biden-Harris ticket historic
So it's Biden/Harris vs TP.
Biden didn‚Äôt even recognize his sister and wife.
Not to delegitimize your anger, but a lot of people have it far worse than you and their situation will be made no better and possibly worse under Biden.
I understand the mentality of the lesser of two evils that we keep getting stuck with. I‚Äôm also genuinely worried that if Biden somehow wins, social movements will be pacified and it‚Äôll be just as hard to enact change that positively effects the people. We‚Äôll be back in the loop.
She‚Äôs not Saint Bernie and will never be Saint Bernie and Biden also is not Saint Bernie. We all get it.
Biden: Just raise your hands and look to the sky Harris: No, Joe, I have my own style
Congrats to Kamala Harris, great pick Joe Biden! A historic day for the Democrats and America!
It‚Äôs now time to unite, work, support &amp; vote for Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris!

I cannot believe Biden actually picked Copmala as his VP... 2020 is truly unreal
A Biden administration would not be better for the people.
yeah he‚Äôs not great in lots of ways but i would rather organize against biden than trump.
if y‚Äôall think a biden administration wouldn‚Äôt be easier to win demands against you need to really reevaluate what trump has done in response to movements.
Ask your self if the system will actually change for the better under Biden and Harris. Plug into a community and build power and safety outside of the fucked up system, if we really want to change the way America works and treats people we have to stop playing its game.

Did she not vote for Biden or something?
As a life long Catholic, this is fucking enraging. Joe Biden is a devoted baptized Catholic you can't take that away from him because you dislike his politics.  come get your boy Providence, RI needs a new Bishop.
Has he heard what he has said about Joe Biden?  Seriously, can some journalist please ask him why it‚Äôs ok for him to say the stuff he says about Biden but somehow Kamala Harris is nasty for saying far, far less?
Nothing says Catholic hierarchy more than thinking child sexual abuse is totally fine, but then slandering a devout Catholic like Joe Biden because of politics. This bishop is the embodiment of everything wrong with the Catholic Church. Sad.
talk is cheap. did you vote for McCain/Palin or Obama/Biden?
I‚Äôm so hyped, going to put a Biden/Harris bumper sticker on my car which thus far in my 66 years has only been honored with a herkey!
For those who say don‚Äôt vote for Biden. Who am I supposed to vote for then? You realize it‚Äôs him or trump.
Spend some time and drive around the Midwest. Let me know how many Biden signs you see lol. Trump isn‚Äôt losing Iowa, Mo, Kansas, or Wisconsin
This is such a rewrite of history. Joe Biden was in 1st when all the other candidates dropped out. He had a deafening victory in SC and most of the candidates that subsequently dropped out didn‚Äôt even reach the delegate threshold there. üòÇüòÇ
Trump or Biden
Do not fucking vote for Joe Biden.
Biden committed to a woman vp, there is organization in Iowa, I have written lots of emails and made lots of calls about UBI to all my representatives.
Who y‚Äôall voting for now that Biden has an evil cop as vp?
Very motivated to support the Biden/Harris ticket. Senator  is an experienced leader, and a first-class, delightful human being. Well done, Joe Biden! Can't think of anyone more qualified to help cart the entire Trump enterprise to the curb.
Let‚Äôs see...it‚Äôs been 30 hrs without power, my dad‚Äôs corn crop was flattened by a hurricane in fucking Iowa, my work increased but my pay was cut, I can‚Äôt find childcare for my daughter this fall, and my grandfather died last week. And I should be worried about Biden‚Äôs America?!
Congratulations!   I‚Äôm so excited for Biden/Harris.  You‚Äôre going to absolutely kill it as VP.  I need a yard sign and bumper stickers!!!
Where did Biden say that?
The activist left would've found anything to bitch about the VP pick. You said it yourself, Biden didn't get this far by taking the ineffectual whiners of the activist left 100% seriously.
It is official! Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his Vice Presidential pick. Here she is meeting Griff on our very own campus!

biden picked kamala to appeal to blue lives matter fuckfaces let‚Äôs be real
Biden is probably really glad he picked an articulate woman like Tulsi as his running mate...OH&gt;&gt;&gt;WAIT....#nevermind
I picked up a night time 12 hour shift at work last night, and then came home to nap. When I woke up, I saw all the posts that Biden had picked Harris to be his running mate.   BahahhaahHhHHahahahHhahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahah
Made it before 5PM Central...  The Business News Headlines: Mortgage issues. More of these are closing but nobody knows how many. Former Vice President Biden names his running mate. What happened on Wall Street and more:
So I‚Äôm guessing the Biden/Harris campaign slogan is gonna be:   ‚ÄúBailing out one ‚Äòsuspect who shot at police, a woman accused of killing a friend, and a twice-convicted sex offender‚Äô at a time.‚Äù
How many middle fingers does the DNC &amp; Biden campaign even have?? I‚Äôve lost count at how many they‚Äôve thrown up towards the Left.
‚ÄúBiden Taps Kamala Harris‚Äù may be the most truthful headline the MSM has published all year.
Question why vote for the same ppl who have kept minorities down for years with there policies? Do you really think anything‚Äôs gonna change? It didn‚Äôt get any better under obama and Biden was a part of that train wreck. The real question is do you want change or more of the same
I am happy with Biden‚Äôs selection. I really like her! Now let‚Äôs rally around the ticket. Be nice, be supportive, be focused. Be ready to üó≥ üåä Ôøº#BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
My fondest political wish is for Biden to win and immediately retire, because fuck yeah president Harris.
If I'm a Trump supporter, I'm thrilled with Biden's VP pick...but that's because I'd be a freaking idiot.
All I gotta say is don‚Äôt stop rallying in the streets, we will have to ramp up the fight ten-fold if Biden wins. Keep your anger, hold that rage in and use it to mobilize for actual systemic change. We can‚Äôt let the establishment win &amp; put us to sleep again. #VoteThemAllOut
I think the big win here is that this meme can make a comeback now that Biden chose her as his runningmate. AMIRITE OR AM I RIGHT?
How do you feel about Biden's VP choice?
I‚Äôm not shocked at Biden‚Äôs pick. This country is a hell-scape after all; but it‚Äôs just sickening the disdain corrupt, corporate &amp; establishment ghouls openly have for any sort of progress in this pathetic excuse of a ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù nation. It‚Äôs beyond infuriating.

It‚Äôs beautiful Trump doesn‚Äôt need to figure out new campaign ads he Biden Harris already made all the henwill ever need
Too bad Biden openly said he isn‚Äôt going to reign in any fracking.
Watching #Rosetwitter and #Maga react identically at the news about #BidenHarris reaffirms my hatred for both groups and the fact Biden made a good choice.  #Rosetwitter meltdowns give me life.
Biden Chose Harris. Let the gate keeping by white peoples begin.
Ya mean hold Biden‚Äôs hand
Never forget #Kamala  #Biden
Joe Biden made a really strong choice picking #TulsiGabbard as his V P Nominee....OH...WAIT A MINUTE!!!   #nevermind
This is literally my stance.  I'm gonna crack jokes. I'm DEFINITELY going to listen to all of the POC &amp; other disenfranchised voters who have valid criticisms of both Biden &amp; Harris' voting records.  But we need AT MINIMUM a reset. And this is the only viable option now.
And here‚Äôs the one  and I did with  in September 2019 for that same series.
Lmao people really thought Biden would be different than Trump.
Progressives: ACAB  Biden: you mean "police officer"
gonna enjoy the tidal wave of ‚ÄúACAB! but we stan our woke poc kween! biden/harris 2020!‚Äù posts. im gonna have to go offline permanently
Honestly though, they think the Left will get complacent and quiet if Biden wins; like during the Obama years. They‚Äôre in for a rude awakening, these protests &amp; direct actions will only continue and ramp up further the longer we go without change. We can‚Äôt give up the fight now.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not voting third party but before all of you fake BLM supporters get excited about the Kamala VP pick, remember she and Biden both are a huge reason there is a police brutality and private prison problem.
Initially, my desire to see Joe Biden elected was based on reversing the ugliness and stupidity of the last four years.  The possibility of four years of   sketches is now a very close secondary motivator.  C‚Äômon America - let‚Äôs make this happen!

Gotta refer to black people in the third person because according to Joe Biden, im not black because I refuse to blindly vote for him or any other Democrat for that matter
Oh heck yeah. Even if he‚Äôd picked Ted Cruz I‚Äôm voting for Biden.Accused of being a serial harasser in 2019, Joe Biden did what comes naturally. He apologized for perceived past misbehavior, and, to appease his accusers, pledged to choose a woman for a Biden ticket.
In the midwest we call a loose meat sandwich - Slow Joe. Ironic isn't it you have Mike Pence wanting to give V.P Harris his red meat and Donald Trump nicknaming President Biden after a meat sandwich

"This is not about rights. It's about responsibility"  Biden says that every governor in the nation should put a mask mandate into effect to slow the spread of the virus and open schools faster.  What's your take on this?
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Insane....  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. ‚ÄúHey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúReady to work! Let‚Äôs go (Dr. Jill Biden)!‚Äù he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
How about giving attention to the current administrations dehumanization of women and minorities. Catholic‚Äôs silence on the way the last 4 years have gone is far worse than any position taken by Biden Harris.

I have as many critiques of Biden as I do Harris. But she made Kavanaugh cry, so she‚Äôs a goddamn hero in my book.
You would say that about any pick that Biden made for VP.. Biden will be his own man, doing what's best for THE PEOPLE.. Which is a stark contrast from our current pile of shit leadership
Kamala Harris? Really Biden? That‚Äôs the best you could find? The woman who got absolutely annihilated on national television against Tulsi Gabbard for being a shitty person?
Watching BBC World News   now, and it full-time discussion of Biden's selection of Kamala Harris. Seems it's also a BFD in the UK and around the planet.

Police unions endorse candidates all the time. If they endorsed Biden you sure as fuck wouldn't be saying stupid sgit like this.
I know the birther crap is crap, but Kamala Harris is not a queen. Most DEMs especially young progressive ones can't stand her politics.  I'm having a hard time voting for Biden because of her Wall Street connections &amp; minority prosecuting record. Her flip-flops are intolerable.
Joe Biden is a good and decent man &amp; has many other qualities needed in a POTUS. trump is everything we never want to see again in a POTUS.
Trump just lost the support of the USPS union. They have officially endorsed Biden. Trump isn‚Äôt doing himself any favors by alienating voters.   those are voters in Iowa that  will be losing too. #BidenHarris2020

Harris talking about Biden's deceased son is kinda hard to watch
Joe Biden's VP pick of Kamala Harris is all about Obama's legacy &amp; less about beating Trump. What it ignores, Harris is not liked by young black voters &amp; MOST Latino voters.    Why is this an issue? Latinos are the largest minority voting group in America.

someone came less than 24 hours after they announced the vp and wanted a biden harris sign   i love the enthusiasm
I agree.  VP Biden does not need the debates.   Demand he released his taxes,  an on site fact checker,  &amp; if he interrupts,  he loses his response time.

It should be clear to all that this country is beyond repair and will need to be rebuilt from the ashes.. A Biden presidency is simply delaying the inevitable.. I know that‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow.. but hey.
So fucking what if Trump wins again.   I am dead if Biden wins and I'll be dead if Trump wins. After five damn years fighting inside the Dem Party and on Twitter, I AM OVER CARING!   I DON'T FOCKING CARE ABOUT POLITICS.
You should be in that Biden spot.  You should be our next President, but I guess I will just have to look forward to 2028.
Stop saying she's progressive. Hillary tried to pull that shit and we destroyed her argument and exposed her for the filthy Neolib she is. Kamala is a Hillary clone and is as neoliberal as they come. Joe Biden is worse. He is a Conservative Dem. Progressives are Dem Socialists.

Don't tell me I'm being a dick after you say I'm being dense. If you can accept Biden for as flawed and awful a candidate as he is then you shouldn't have any issues with Kamala.
I would like to believe he is smiling down at Biden/Harris.

WRONG. Trump turned anybody with a respectable bone in their body Biden voters. Harris is a very moderate person. She is a former AG that is respectable. Trump can't compete. Keep spreading your LIES and FAKE NEWS. Nobody believes you.
She is a former AG that served real law &amp; order. She doesn't spend her time wasting away bitching and moaning on twitter. Good for her. Biden/Harris 2020
Biden/Harris over here serving that election erection.
I don‚Äôt think they gain any votes on the ticket with this move The kids that hear ‚Äúfree college‚Äù were already going to vote for Biden, and this move doesn‚Äôt do anything to gain the middle aged that actually understand what it takes to give free college, and Kamala doesn‚Äôt do that
Obama / Biden were in office for 8 years, and your organization continued to make it possible for disturbed teen-agers and abusive men to get guns and shoot innocent people.

Biden choosing Kamala for VP means two things: 1. He‚Äôs targeting the woman vote b/c he knows the rape allegations against him will soon come to fruition.  2. He‚Äôs targeting minority vote because he‚Äôs a liberal &amp; CAREER liberals take marginalized communities &amp; further marginalize.

Didn‚Äôt  call Biden a racist and say she believes his rape accusers??? Interesting choice
Joe Biden had a number of Midwest options for VP. Ultimately he chose a liberal career politician from California. Who‚Äôs standing up for our Midwest values? The #GOP team is committed to protecting what‚Äôs most important to maintaining our quality of life in America‚Äôs heartland.

Harris,¬†a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
UPDATE: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Biden/Harris... lets gooooooooo
Joe Biden's Vice President will be Kamala Harris not Susan Rice. Here's how I responded.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
Monday: Biden is not Trump Tuesday: Biden is not Trump Wednesday: Biden is not Trump Thursday: Joe Biden is not Trump, oh, I'm Joe Biden, ice cream   "Best convention ever"
It is NOT The vice presidential nominee will be speaking right before Barack Obama. Who has the best relationship with Barack Obama and Joe Biden because she worked with them in the Obama White House, Susan Rice.
Val is not a person friend of Obama and Biden's Rice is. She was always a top two pick.
Wrong! They would never leave Susan Rice off. She is a HUGE friend of Obama and Biden. This is the schedule and Rice is the VP.
If Kamala Harris was a VP she would not be speaking twice. I don't see Susan Rice there.   It's obvious she's Biden's pick. Sorry KHive your Queen will never be VP or President
OVER MY DEAD BODY!   I'm only voting for Biden to get rid of Trump.  Biden and his VP will be defeated by a progressive in 2024. Biden better focking not all of a sudden be declared incompetent in middle of his term. If he is, they knew about it before and it was a cover up.
How about we say we disagree with her policies and would never vote for her or Biden if it wasn't for the fact Trump is so dangerous.
He's covering for her. She'll be mad if he doesn't pick her and KHive will be Swarming and ready to mass sting anyone who comments that Biden made the right choice not picking her.
Are you insane? They are the only reason I'm still on Twitter. Silence them and I won't vote for Joe Biden.
Laughable... how convenient to say that when Biden has lost his marbles
Pandering is Biden‚Äôs mantra...
Joe Biden's campaign seems to be going well
Go riden with Biden!
Donald Fucking Trump, I will be glad when you are dead and gone! You are a worthless piece of shit! Joe Biden is going to kick your worthless ass!!!!  You are a sorry excuse for a human being!!!!!   When you die I will piss on your grave, maybe shit on your tombstoneüòÇüòÖü§£üï∑‚ò†Ô∏èüíÄ
The Democratic Party has an embarassment of riches. I will vote for Joe Biden no matter what. All of the women floated as potential VP picks are outstanding. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Shapiro did a whole show on Covid, shreds Trump regularly, and says Biden should keep doing what he‚Äôs doing. Questioning his competence is out of line? This is a lie just like everything else said about Shapiro.
Biden: Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.
I'm not voting against donald. I am voting for Joe Biden because I value all life. I value the rule of law.  I value our constitution and I value myself.  Btw, there are no Republicans in congress.  There are no Republicans in the White House either.
Hillary was a dumpster fire. Biden‚Äôs better but my post was more or less saying that Polls don‚Äôt matter. At all really. It‚Äôs happened before and overconfidence is a dangerous game.
People like her turn a blind eye to Biden‚Äôs racist past and his inappropriateness with little girls. Orange man bad!! Love to know how Trump supports racism...I‚Äôll wait.
Gonna be real weird when Kamala starts trending and everyone thinks Biden‚Äôs chosen his running mate.

It has come to my attention that the Biden campaign is using the slogan ‚ÄúBuild Back Better.‚Äù As a person who over-relies on alliteration in my own article titles, I generally like it, but I feel sad that they didn‚Äôt use what I consider to be his signature word: Malarkey.
Do you want to know what Biden stands for?? Biggest. Idiot. Democrats. Ever. Nominated.

But Rice could be tasked with dealing with international front (foreign policy) will Biden deals with the domestic front!
I just about had enough of the DNC. Can't wait to keep on destroying them by helping to fund progressive primary challenges of Neolib incumbents.   Special note: My anger doesn't mean I won't vote for Dementia Joe Biden because Trump is an insane maniac that needs to be in prison
Yes he needs help not social media posts calling him a con man. Just another reason why I can't stand resistors.  Just a bunch of freaking Biden bullies.
Trump obviously doesn't want to get elected. He just garrenteed that Biden will win. My Social Security benefits in eight years mean everything to me and I'm Ready to fight a Civil War to keep it and have it increased.
Don't use voter shaming on me.  I don't believe in 3rd parties in GE. I would never criticize your right to vote 4 them.  Who said I was voting for Trump or Biden? It is perfectly acceptable to refuse to vote for either of them. In Iowa u can mark on ballot a no vote for POTUS.
I vote the way I want, you vote yours. I either vote for Biden, Trump or refuse to pick and log a no vote for President. Option 3 is a protest vote.  I don't support 3rd party runs for President. Nothing or no one can EVER make me do that.
It‚Äôs insane that Biden‚Äôs bike ride excited me. The simplicity of every second of it spoke volumes.
Harris is using the opposition research she gathered. She is a very evil woman. I will never vote for Biden if he picks her. I don't like eat-mongering Susan Rice, but she's better than Kamala.   Karen Bass is the best and safest choice.
Thats why I said alone, sadly. We are not getting a much more selfless candidate like a Bernie, and we may never in this country. But I will take Biden over that orange slime any day.
And did you also see that Instagram, owned by FB, was suppressing suppressing negative Trump hashtags but not Biden ones. None of it is accidental.
JOE  BIDEN  needs your help. The United States Needs Your Help.
Rates have nothing to do with the ACA. Republicans refuse to cap premiums.   Trump cannot get rid of the ACA and then Rename it as Trumpcare. He is such a total insecure loser.  FYI - I'm not a fan of Barack Obama, Joe Biden or any Repub or Dem. I don't like either party.
Joe Biden should pick Lori Lightfoot as his VP so she can just yell at us and shame us into making better decisions.

Joe Biden hates black people. Donald Trump loves black people. Yet blacks will still vote for biden
Joe Biden's dangerous liberal agenda would upset god and bring a plague upon the earth. And you are helping it CNN so shame on you.
That's exactly why I am not watching that crap. I have no desire to see Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren or even Joe Biden and his VP speak.   I don't give a fock about the convention.
Yes I agree, but how can we convince people to get out and vote? Russia is working on tRump‚Äôs behalf by denigrating Biden and sowing seeds of doubt about the election.
It will be Susan Rice who has a really good working relationship with Joe. Kamala Harris attacked Biden. She's too ambitious And will try to overshadow Joe, which won't be hard. Harris would be willing declare Joe incompetent just to be president. #NeverKamala
When Joe Biden loses in a landside and the Black vote for Trump is 90%, I wonder what their excuse will be
Joe Biden is the obvious presidential candidate to lead our country!!!!!
I don‚Äôt have a problem with honest criticism, but so much of the attacks on Biden seem utterly contrived and propagandistic.
I am with you but Biden will make it even harder for me to vote for him if he picks Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I might have to get drunk and stoned before I fill out my ballot if they are on it.
just because biden says he will DOESNT MEAN HE'LL DO ITBiden is
Do you want a president who spends his time tweeting or golfing or holding press conferences which actually are a campaign rally...or would you like a president who is empathetic, engaged in the good of the country and focused...vote Biden. You may just need some help..
Karmallow Biden 2020 ‚ÄúWe Gitch Ya‚Äù
I‚Äôm not telling you to vote for Biden I don‚Äôt think I mentioned Biden I‚Äôm telling you to vote period Vote when the choices aren‚Äôt Biden vs trump  vote for cori bush vote for Bernie vote for AOC but vote and out vote the old people and you might actually see some change
If young people actually voted Bernie would have won in 2016 and we would have Medicare for ALL and free college and this pandemic wouldn‚Äôt be kick this country‚Äôs butt like it is right now so if you didnt want Biden or Hillary the time to vote was January
That makes no sense.   If you would rather have a racist, misogynistic, inept criminal who is murdering 1,000 Americans every day with his incompetence in the White House than Biden and Harris, then I feel very sad for you and for our country.
On August 20th, Joe Biden will accept the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Don‚Äôt miss it.  #DemConvention
Dear Sir, I'm a democrat n wanted to  mail in my vote for Biden/Harris, but will go vote at the polls since you've rigged the post office system.
when Obama...O I mean Biden squints his eyes raises his chin and gives his best presidential gaze of fortitude just doesn‚Äôt drive the momentum that Trump gets with some off the wall bizarre rant Obama...oops I mean Biden has noooo energy
That's your takeaway? Did you even hear the very real audio of Biden?
presidential elections are always about a symbol a statement momentum Biden literally represents someone else‚Äôs symbol someone else‚Äôs vision and it‚Äôs a black guy how ironic a white guy taking credit for a black man‚Äôs accomplishments Biden is a fraud
Whatever ‚Äúracial gaffe‚Äù Biden made pales in comparison to  decision to attend Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa with no mask and no social distancing
Joe Biden or Donald Trump vs "Titan" or "Gemini" would liven things up this coming political season to be sure
Of course they will. Joe Biden would force them all off their land
As a born and raised Buckeye, the smartest thing that Democrats can do is to nonstop connect Trump‚Äôs handling of the Coronavirus to the loss of OSU football. That will guarantee a win for the Biden Harris ticket.
He goes even lower by accusing her of ignoring the debunked false charges against Biden. (The fact he would go THERE blows my mind!)
The Oval Office occupier accused  of treating  badly during the contest for the Nomination. He claims she "mocked" VP Biden. He is trying to tear her down by throwing around accusations about what her policies will be.
The fact they keep saying we can push Biden/Harris farther left afterwards is absolutely childlike naivety, and really quite insulting, as if the Democratic Party hasn't been telling progressives to fuck off for 4 years.
I completely agree with you Sam. The only rational thing to do is vote for Biden. That being said I think there are a good amount of actual criticisms one can make against Biden and Kamala, but I‚Äôm still voting for them.
What? You chose Biden, that has to tell you how insane this statement is.
The way you phrased it seemed like you were you blaming people who aren‚Äôt involved in politics for the ticket. Any democrat with half a brain is going to vote for Biden. I assumed you were talking about people not being actively involved and not just like people tweeting lol
After the "If you don't vote for me, you ain't black!" comment, Joe Biden goes full "I'm not racist, I have a Black Friend!" for his VP pick.  Raise your hand if you saw this coming... üòí
Yea, drain the swamp. Vote Biden.
I am beyond grateful to the  campaign for affording me the privilege of working, and representing this campaign during the Iowa Caucus. My role going forward may not be needed as much as before, but one thing that‚Äôs for certain is Biden/Harris has my vote &amp; full support.
Very confused. I thought there was nothing wrong with Joe Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇ
'Well now I'm definitely not voting for Biden" says person who wasn't going to vote for Biden regardless.
Biden has broken Cinnamon Bun. Fucking Biden...
Congratulations, Biden. You've made Cinnamon Bun angry and swear on the timeline, you asshole.
One: Being better than the nazi candidates is a VERY low bar to meet  Two: There were far more options than just senators.   Biden's biggest weakness is his stance on progressive issues, and he picked the least progressive running mate of the ones being vetted
Let‚Äôs Do This! Biden-Harris!

Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots
Reporters were stationed outside Biden's house (and I think Bayh's house) and there were minute by minute updates on what they were doing in their personal lives.
I am amazed at the response of voters in my state of Iowa. Every week I pass by a house of a person who has always been a staunch Republican. Their yards are always plastered with R. Yard signs. Yesterday I drove by, and saw a United for Biden sign. ‚ù§Ô∏è America is ready for change
I think, should VP Biden win, that he will have a cabinet opportunity
I held my nose and gagged as I voted for Hillary last election. Biden is so much better than Trump or Hillary.
WORST TALK SHOW HOST EVER  Hannity supports Joe Biden for president!

All this because I suggested multiple Biden race related gaffes points to something deeper.
In my personal conversations with the VP during the Iowa Caucus journey I can say  has a genuine &amp; enthusiastic heart for the AA Community. The many AA staffers on his campaign proves that. Don‚Äôt believe the hype. My people are riding with Biden.
Just a reminder   That you cosigned a letter with then VP Joe Biden to fight corruption in Ukraine. #RussianAsset Stop this madness and follow your oath to the country
Its a long way till Biden takes over and he will say and do anything to hang on to the presidency
