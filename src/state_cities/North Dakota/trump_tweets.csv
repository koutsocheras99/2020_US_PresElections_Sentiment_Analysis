Sometimes I feel like us U.S. citizens are the kids in between Trump and the media, the parents that don’t get along and play emtional games with each other and only the kids feel the effects
Remember when Trump grotesquely asked black voters what they had to lose by voting for him...this is what was lost, crime increased because the issues weren’t even looked at
Capitalism is boss, but go ahead &amp; vote for Socialism and then see how much your party gives a crap about you. One more thing...why is that only Democrats are against a photo ID to vote? Why do they want mail-in instead of absentee voting? I think we know who cheats. Trump 2020!
I had a feeling she wouldn't vote Biden, despite how much she says she doesn't like Trump. Now she's setting up her reason, just like Trump saying the election will be rigged. She's still party over country. A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.

I'm so sick of these Magas claiming that nothing was found during the Russia investigation. The only reason Trump is still in office is because 52 Republican Senators decided to ignore the evidence. Many are on record admitting just that.
I will never forget the time I was in Cork Ireland, in a swanky hotel, in a lux hot tub, with two very attractive James Bond type looking men, who asked me point blank “why in gods green earth did the U.S pick Trump“I slid under the water.

I can think of when I hear that Trump has criticized Deborah Brix is this scene in Captain America World Police:
I rarely see anyone claim Donald Trump works tirelessly. No pay? Trump properties like his Washington hotel, Florida resort and assorted golf properties benefit greatly from his presidency. His constant lying, name-calling, etc. is proof to me that he doesn't respect the office.
OK, I respectfully disagree. Where is your evidence that Donald Trump wants to help all Americans? Roughly two-thirds of Americans aren't seeing it. Again, where are my insults? Where's my denigration? Yes, people are angry at this administration. And for some very good reasons.
Where's the insult? Where's the denigration? Donald Trump is in this for himself, his family and the Trump organization. That's about it. He wants to get re-elected. Or, maybe he doesn't.
Yes, and since you believe that, I have some real estate to sell you in Queens. Donald Trump wants to help himself. He doesn't understand the office or what it's supposed to stand for.
Your argument only goes so far. You hit a snag, you compromise and try again. Even though the Trump Administration has been trying to chip away at it now for years, the ACA has helped 20-million Americans get healthcare insurance. To me that Obama = 20-million. Trump = nothing.
Have 157,000 Americans died in the pandemic because of the press?  No.  They've died because of TRUMP.  He's the enemy of the people.  #TrumpIsLosing #DearMichigan #ElPasoStrong #ReplaceEllen NASDAQ Barron Frorida Birx Peter Navarro Nevada
Donald Trump campaigned on repealing and replacing the Affordable Healthcare Act starting on his first day in office, or some such nonsense. He has been president 3 years 195 days and NOTHING. YET. Hard work, indeed.
Donald Trump is against State's Rights. This is what he literally says.
Promises or not, Donald Trump has put forth NOTHING on healthcare.
Here’s an issue that worries me about Fox News. The headline states “Biden should not debate Trump, then you go to the story and it continues with Clinton people said. Wrong wording and backwards. Fox is not who they used to be
But Donald Trump isn't putting forth ANYTHING!
Well, Donald Trump has promised to release his healthcare plan right about now. So, we'll be ok!
Trump has no soul.
To me, "settling" means voting for the candidate likely to win your state/area. Like, since I live in ND, I would have to "settle" for Trump because what's the point of voting for any other party since 60-70% of the state is Republicans? I would hate that.
when Kevin and Senator Heitkamp were debating, Kevin said it was silly to think Trump would kill the post office, and yet --- now he is, remember, it's not a new phenomenon. A rural-state Senator should want citizens 2b served well; his real ruler wants to hurt the #postoffice.

What she said is that voter fraud is statistically insignificant.  The odds of voter fraud is 0.00006%.  You have better odds of getting hit by lightning than voter fraud.  Plus you and trump aren't even quoting the nevada law correctly.  Get your facts right and stop lying.
He’s staying quiet so all the focus is on the idiotic things Trump is saying. He doesn’t even have to try to win at this point.
I am embarrassed for the idiots like April Ryan et al who suggest that Trump won't leave the White House they just make this time 💩 and up! but their ignorant viewers believe them.
They will go down with the tRump ship and continue  gurgling their support for their orange fuhrer

Of course Biden is in mental decline...he's a terrible candidate to run for POTUS.  Which is WHY Trump should be ahead in every poll, but he's not.  The handling of COVID will play a big factor in determining this election, whether Trump fans want to admit it or not.
Trump has turned them into a cult. My  replies been flooded since last night because I simply said Biden is probably going to win.  They have to be blind to see they are jeopardy of losing in Nov.
Trump's Schick is his constant bragging and self praise.  We've been dealing with a pandemic for months now, with no end in sight.  Let's get rid of COVID, before we brag about "poll numbers". That's what turns ppl off.

Sorry but U.S. Politics is a two-party system. A no-vote is just as good as a vote for someone who supports abortion up to the point of birth. Trump may not be a stand-up guy..But abortion has no grey area. So every prolife person can either choose a vote for life or for murder.

Just another Trump supporter trying to make everyone question the election results this November. If we lose faith in our elections, then there is no USA. This is exactly what our adversaries want and we have people in the U.S. doing their work for them.
My thoughts as well, there are enough things to hit Trump with, this ain't one of them
I have no idea where people come up with the idea that Trump will "destroy" Biden in a debate. Trump says stupid and insane 💩 repeatedly and almost every day.
The even cringier part of that is when he says he will let the American people judge his "physical and mental fitness" and can't even get the words out of his mouth with bumbling. It's even worse that Trump isn't much better.

Exclusive: President Donald J. Trump tells Gray Television Washington Bureau Chief Jacqueline Policastro he’s ready to step in to provide another stimulus to Americans struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.
I think President Trump makes a great point here, if the reporter weren't so rude. We should be THANKING the President for inventing the COVID-19 test, which didn't even exist until he took office!

There's big government, a limited government, or a government that applies lessons from outside government sectors to improve government. There's still the conceit that it's to make government work. The Trump administration is simply an exercise in having bad government.
President Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat. But what is WeChat, and why is it so controversial?

The Trump Virus, he owns it now!
Hey, the anti-anti-Trumpers come out to defend Trump suggesting we tear up the US Constitution.
With Trump showing that the President is above the law complete latitude is available for President Biden. If he wants a more Progressive Supreme Court, he tweets that he will pardon anyone charged with "eliminating" a Conservative judge. Total Fascism.

Place you bets: How long before Trump throws Herman Cain's body under the bus? "He was pretty old, and had a lot of health problems..." He'll say it. Anything to not admit that Cain got the virus at the Trump rally in Tulsa June 20. Cain beat stage 4 colon cancer 9 years ago.

President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a “delay” to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.

Not that he cares, but Herman Cain, who attended Trump's Tulsa rally maskless, has died of Covid-19.  Trump's reckless demand for attention may have been the cause of Cain's death.

Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
No. Biden said the name three times in the clip I saw. He pronounced it correctly once. And corrected himself once. For Pence and Carlson the mispronunciation is intentional.
Herman Cain died on 30 July but tweeted this out on 12 Aug.  And he is calling the Biden campaign "completely nuts".
He's a former New Castle County Council Member and a public defender. No prosecutorial experience for Biden that I am aware of.
Nice to see that you and  are still trying to push narrative by blatantly lying to the people of this great nation. If both of you spoke the truth you wouldn’t have a platform!! Good ol’ Lying Biden !
That doesn't mean he's going to resign on day 1 though.  Biden and his circle have been aiming for the Presidency for 40+ years. Why people think he'll easily relinquish that job now is beyond me, unless his health literally gets to the point where he cannot do it.

Biden should name some cabinet members and start having daily press conferences.
I mean, I get it. It’s not exciting and is disappointing that this is what the ticket is. But I didn’t expect more from Biden in his choice.
I give it about 3 campaign rallies before Biden starts calling her 'koala'?  #KamalaHarris
I give it about 3 campaign rallies before Biden starts calling 'koala'.
She’s not my top choice, but I don’t see cause for alarm either. We’re weathering through Biden getting the top nod, so I’ll take what I can get here.
We all know about the Democratic Presidential Nominee's age. One could just say that Kamala Harris is just Biden her time for a while till she gets a chance.
It isn't just Joe Biden now. It's #BidenHarris2020 now. Team effort, and between the two of you, we can get back to restoring this nation!
One could say Harris is just Biden her time for a few years.
Yeah, I think Harris was a great pick to even Biden out. She takes far less shit than Biden does.
I would, but I'm afraid my co-workers may do something to my car lol. Pretty sure I'm the only one voting Biden where I work. Dreading to hear all the bitching tomorrow too. I need a new job, anyone hiring in a warmer state? 🤪

Wonder who broke the news to Biden that she’s the pick?
Both Clinton's, Pelosi, and Jill Biden instead of Yang. The  is doing absolutely everything to make sure young voters don't vote
Biden preparing to announce running mate by mid-week - NYT
Since Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, and Karen Bass have been discussed, if Biden is elected with one of them:  Harris or Bass would be just the second VP born west of Stonewall, TX (error in my original tweet) after Nixon. Susan Rice would be the second VP born in DC (Gore).
Re-upping this since we are in the middle of the Veepstakes for Joe Biden right now. Birthplaces of Vice Presidents. Strong preference for swings states (which NY once was) and also the state of Vermont.

Bigger than the collapse of Wall Street fix by Obama and Biden, bigger than the Great Depression, bigger than WWI where 116k americans lost their lives. Trump has us on a rocket to break WWII deaths by spring. 416800 is the number of deaths he is tracking and trying to reach. SOS
Fuck biden and trump all we need is ratings   Vote for the Masterater in Novemeber
Almost apple season. How you like them apples? What’s up with you and your willie. Nobody has cared about that for ages lol.  Sit back, relax, the big man, Mr. Biden, is almost in the drivers seat. There could be little turbulence initially but it will smooth out to a nice flight
Pick a poll, any poll. Biden Harris are pulling away with it. America is so tired of all the lies, the torture of anyone’s children, the overt racism and the goose step toward Facist strongman with tiny hands. The crooks he cant get past senate approval and did I mention lies?
Well over the last 35+ years both progressives and liberals have proven to me why I never will trust them or even respect them. I see Harris to be a pro-abortion Nazi-feminist. Biden is seen as a worthless Asshole. That was based on their political views and what the they support
Biden is an alt-left wing lemming. Harris is a pro-abortion Nazi-feminist. That is based off first impressions and knowledge of their political leanings on issues. That means they are untrustworthy and I can never respect them.
Dr.  Do you need a safe space?   Biden hasn’t done a thing in 40’years.  Also do t you think it’s a joke to be in Washington that long.   Maybe term limits?   Notice how I didn’t call Biden names because I don’t agree with his policies.  Maybe try that iapproach.
Harris trashed herself by being a pro-abortion Nazi-feminist. I have always seen Biden and Obama to be untrustworthy and not to be respected. Trump did nothing to sway my opinions about those three.
Saw a MAGAt argue that we can't have mail-in voting because the Postal Workers Union endorsed Biden, the candidate who’s not actively trying to dismantle their organization &amp; hijack an election. This is their twisted logic in a nutshell. #TrumpForPrison2020 #SaveThePostOffice
China wants Biden so you can start paying back your loans or they can foreclose. Plus they're exhausted dealing with an imbecile that makes no sense.

BaBye.  46+47=Biden Harris Maybe in 12 years what’s left of the GOP will put up drunky Matt.
Voting for Biden and Kamala is not going to erase the irreparable damage they have already done. It not only justifies their shitty stances but does very little to change systemic problems.
Dude was in some horror movie my grandmother told me about. I’d imagine his aides have his twitter account and goof on some fools. 46+47= Biden Harris
I felt so much hurt though your poem. U can go to any fire station  4 help. 1st begin to love yourself, not just using your left hand because it feels like you are with a stranger, your heart can open to the Biden Harris equation 46+47= USA wins. Even his “ballandchain” feels it
I feel like you didn't read my response since I'm saying I'm not even convinced Biden/Harris is progress if all they do is bring the Dem party to the right; Mass incarceration, pot criminalized, still ICE, no univ healthcare, etc. It's gunna be BS ID politics. Hope I'm wrong.
it would actually slap if Biden could be construed as a socialist in any meaningful way
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have nothing to run on except being for law breakers at the expense of the law abiding
Biden has a very long history of plagiarism, back to his early days in Congress.  He probably hasn't had an original political thought, ever.  But his racism shines through every single time he speaks!  But, he's a Dem, so that doesn't matter.
Internal Documents Circulated To DNC Delegates Hint At Why Biden Picked Harris  via
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
Trump is an unmitigated disaster. The GOP should own that. Instead, the Democrats have invited them to headline the DNC, form a superpac to support Biden, rehabilitate their reputations, and pull the party even further to the right than it already was. This is "resistance"?
I'm trying to stay out of political posts but imagine being the person that die hard supports Trump and also posts about Biden making women uncomfortable. I mean c'mon guys and now I'm seeing stuff about Kamala not being from here like where do we draw the line?
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow pandemic
I swear to god if I wind up voting for Biden &amp; he fucking loses or takes the US farther down the shit hole we’re going down, I’m blocking all you “blue no matter who” bitches. Y’all give me the option of pedo/rapist A or pedo/rapist B &amp; expect me to vote with a clean conscious??
I’ll stress Trump 2020 b4 I let Joe Biden run black ppl into da ground.
After watching Hamilton again, I think that Trump and Biden should duel and whoever wins will be our president.
Once Biden defeats you in November, someone is going to cold clock you sooo effin hard 😆 Your fat ass is going to be lying on the ground crying like the little pansy you are 😂 😂
There is an Australian new channel that has done a segment on Creepy Joe’s memory loss. It’s scary! The title is Biden’s cognitive issues can no longer be ignored.
if anything, one of the reasons a Biden win is important is so there'll be some bipartisan support for restricting executive power- the Ds aren't going to do that when a R is in power, that'd be Going Against The Process, but they might vote for it for a D pres for Bipartisanship
Normally I'm not againsts masks but this coming from Biden? No.
no, what happens in 2024 after a Biden win is that the dems go "oh, that worked" and run another conservative.  and we're *getting* four years of GOP, if not in 2021 then relatively soon. if your strategy is "win every time and change nothing", that's bound to fail eventually
Former Vice President and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden says he wants a three-month nationwide mask mandate. What do you think?
New IV Words – One Berner to others, I’m asking – again – please do not enable Trump. That means voting Biden/Harris rather than staying home or voting for a 3rd-party, no-chance-in-hell candidate. Read the post:  #environment #ClimateCrisis #TrumpOut2020
Biden is responsible for a lot of hardline criminal justice policies that targeted people of color. He's a VERY oldschool democrat. He's no Strom Thurmond that's for sure but he's not what we're looking for progressively. I'll just tell people i'm voting for Harris.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
I assume you're donating all the profits to the Biden/Harris campaign.
C'mon already. I can't stand the fake judge, but she's obviously echoing Fox's lame talking points about Biden not being healthy/fit for office here.   Can we stop being outraged by the worst bad-faith interpretations of EVERYTHING?!
Biden's campaign is incoherent nonsense.  He's holding a knife to stab religious in the back if elected.
also lots of trump signs obviously but i just mean that in the places where you might think you'd see a biden sign, you didn't
drove across northern minnesota recently and saw lots of blm yard signs and state &amp; local DFL candidate signs but not a single biden sign... makes u think
New math   46 + 47= Biden + Harris you will have at least 8 years to comprehend this equation.
God willing BIDEN AND HARRIS WIN and UNDO 45'S TRAITORUS ACTS.THIS INCLUDES REPUGS IN SENATE/AND HOUSE
The country COLLAPSED under you.  The world is laughing at us because of YOU.  Russia and China are taking advantage of us NOW.  Biden/Harris will unite us and make us stronger!
I’m a Christian.   Please stop talking for all “christians”, if your party is really ‘pro-life’ why the vehement stance against masks, against science &amp; for opening the economy &amp; schools without a plan except “thoughts &amp; prayers”.   Asking for a friend!
If y’all idiots vote for Kanye instead of Joe Biden . Trump will win mark my words 🤦🏾‍♂️
I wonder if Kamala will make that same smug, incredulous look on her face when Joe Biden manages to lose against the most unpopular candidate in history.
Biden &amp; Harris sitting in a tree burning America first came crime then came terror then the branch broke and they were eaten by cannibals
I'm confused. Are we talking Trump or Biden?
Nothing that Kamala Harris has said or done in the past is going to matter at this point. Only thing that matters is what she does and says over the next 3 months. Same goes for Biden, unfortunately.
Joe Biden eats little boys , prove me wrong
Who are you voting for &amp; how do you NOT understand that any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump? Like it or not, that’s a fact you can rely on. All this talk to organize, overthrow &amp; protest doesn’t change that &amp; is tangential to the election. Takes a multi-pronged approach.
Cancel Biden!
I disagree. It's the moderates and independents that are going to decide this election and getting as many Republicans as possible to disavow Trump is the best way to get their vote. AOC supporters are voting for Biden anyway except for the few Bernie whiners who are sitting out.
Biden &amp;Harris  Obama &amp; Biden  Third term
Fox News host baselessly claims that 'something's going to happen' to Joe Biden, forcing her colleague to walk her comment back  via  Trump and company only wish something would happen to Biden.
That train about to run into a wall!!! It's called Biden/Harris.
Biden is a lying piece of shit and his running mate is a corrupt ex cop. These are all problems we have with Trump. Picking the lesser of two evils isn't progression. I know it seems bleak, believe me I considered voting Biden too but I'm going green this year.
Well Trump has done more for this country than Biden has and it’s not even close. 3 1/2 years to 50.
So what’re y’all going to wear to Biden’s inauguration? I think I might stick it casual with black and white
It pretty obvious who we’re forced to vote for at this point but people are allowed to air their legitimate grievances with the candidate that’s been forced upon us. I don’t think it’s fair to try to shut down how people feel about Biden.
So people get pissed at Biden
What the hell is wrong with you people? First, Biden is a Catholic.  Second, why would that MATTER???????????
Whoa, boy.  You don't dare go up against Kamala Harris.  She'd eat you alive. As will Joe Biden.  You're failing fast.
Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump  #FoxNews
it’s as if they think the conditions that led us to Trump will disappear by voting in Biden. it’s not gonna get any better and Biden 2020 is gonna set up something psychotic like a Gaetz/Cotton ticket in 2024.
Be careful she panders to the alt-left wing lemmings. According to her and Biden's political leanings on many issues, they are untrustworthy and earned my disrespect.
Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP is like the sound of a starters pistol. It's time. Time to end this horrible joke of a presidency, time for a return to decency, and most importantly, time to kick Covids ass
It’s off and on, site is crashing, but if you go to the antifa website, and click on the “take action link”, it also takes you to the Joe Biden campaign page
And kill the energy economy. Oddly without the growth from the oil industry the   Biden administration would have had a worse economic record. And they still want to destroy the coal, oil industries and the millions of jobs that go with it.
Pro-life groups denounce Biden-Harris as ‘most pro-abortion ticket in history’ -  -
wrong.  Biden said he would appoint Beto as his gun czar.  Just google Beto and guns and see what he has said.
David, I can name several policies but in place by the Trump ADM to improve minorities lives.  What policies have Harris and Biden done in their years in the Senate.  Let me save you the trouble  NADA  zero zip   they talk a big game but don't deliver for minorties ever
Pretty simple, Biden and Harris are spend spend spend, open borders, they are both against fracking and cheap energy.   Both are for higher taxes.  Also both are phonies.  Their policies have done nothing to help minorities and Trump has.  Biden has done nada for 40yrs
what actual alternative is there to Biden though, i don't want to vote for the guy but i just see a bad choice and a worse one
Some things, not everything, will get better if Biden wins. Nothing will get better if we give up and let Trump win.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s VP Pick — Here’s What It Means For The Election And Beyond | FiveThirtyEight
Yes but, if you vote for Biden and live somewhere like California where he's  guaranteed to win, you won't be doing much. But if enough people vote third party, we may see one party adopt their values. This isn't as good as getting a third party president, but it's something.
I seen that lmao plus who use to play footsies with Ghiselle and Epstein!? I am so excited that Biden picked such a strong woman!!! I could tell he was shaking in his  Shoes he took 2 minutes to insult her! It's ok Kamalas a big girl she definitely can handle those twats!

This person is clearly talking about how insane it would be to back Biden right now
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
It's an important and valid question. Joe Biden admitted he probably wouldn't live until the end of his first term. #KamalaHarrisVP #JoeBiden2020
Bill.   What happened to you?    Debates show the difference in policy.  Thinking on your feet.  How you handle pressure.   Only reason you made this idiotic post is yku know Biden would embarrass himself like he did in the Democratic debates and he’s a lot farther gone now
Wow, nothing slanted here from the “impartial media”. She actually says, that it’s likely that Biden won’t be able to fulfill his term. That’s where we are? The left is going to vote for a guy that isn’t going to make it 4 years and will be replaced with a failed candidate.

Well now we know for certain that the Democrats want alt-left wing evil. Harris is a pro-abortionist, and is also known for incarcerating many blacks. I have yet to hear anything positive about her or Biden.
For some strange reason I read your tweet as saying :”Harris will blow Joe Biden.” Weird.
Along with the fact that she called out Joe Biden on his BS on national TV. also, she is the perfect VP to go against the party of "Law and Order" when those fucks wanna try to be like "she is too harsh in constitutes" when they have LITERALLY BEEN PUTTING KIDS IN CAGES
The turn around dialogue gets everyone farther from reality and the reality is BIDEN VS TRUMP. So, to me, while Biden is a fucking nightmare unto himself, tearing down anything anti 🚽 speaks for itself
During his time as Obama's VP, when did he ever show he was a "Uniter"? When did he ever express an appreciation for the local police forces? Didn't ANTIFA and BLM start their roots under the Obama/Biden administration? Biden is now a tool of the Socialist/Communist Left.

is a cop, all cops are bastards. Biden has officially lost ALL of my support. This decision lost him his election.
Biden could just as well have chosen Bernie, since he's adopted Bernie's agenda anyway. They could have made AOC an overlooking presence to secure the young commie vote.
If you're still playing the game that Kamala didn't call Biden a racist than you probably believe Joe had something to do with picking her as his running mate.
Biden just accurately conveyed the basic difference b/w strategy &amp; tactics, and while shocked I'm legit happy when any politician gets it correct.
Curious about Biden's Kamala Harris VP pick? See how she measures up on Rights For All.
Former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has chosen U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American woman on a presidential ticket.
Kamala Harris basically called Biden a rapist and then Joe Biden offered her the vice presidency which she accepted. Huge sellout move on both ends and y’all are eating it up (even though most of you don’t know who Kamala Harris is) because she’s a black woman.
Not sure if Dr. Jill Biden can be Secretary.
Biden doesn't know the difference
We have buttons too!
Trump being a proto-fascist doesn't mean we should allow our leaders to react without scrutiny. Biden could have picked anyone. He picked Kamala Harris.

Great not only do I have to vote for Joe Biden, now I also have to vote for Kamala Harris????? Fuck
Not that they aren’t out there   But there’s an agenda and politics is typically straight pandering to black people.  Sadly population is quick to eat it up   They did it with Obama which is the only reason Biden has a chance at all

More than 100 Black leaders and celebrities urge Biden to pick a Black woman as VP"... I don't think these "Black leaders" will vote for Joe Biden; I don't care what the color of the VP is, BUT! if there are plans to hold the WH in 2024 than I think the answer is obvious.
Joe Biden in the morning without his drum of lotion
Biden won't fix anything
How could you have a ballot already? They are not finalised, Biden hasn't pick his vp yet
You think it’s funny they cover up Biden’s coma?
You can not like trump, vote for Biden and still see that he isn't going to be in charge of anything.
Wait, I thought Joe Biden was still camping out in his basement. 😉
Believe in Life After Biden
It’s just a Joe Biden clone, but a little smaller
So Biden is secretly in charge.  Got it.
You damn right fool! We ask questions. We see whats wrong. And let people know, their common sense is is not the problem. Morons voting for Biden with no clue of where he is. That's the problem. Not Trump. Trump 2020!!
As it stands now, I do not like Trump, but I dislike Biden too. Biden has proven he has an alliance who I describe as the alt-left wing evil lemmings. Trump has proven he doesn't care what the alt-left wing lemmings think about him.
as if I would pay money to vote for Joe Biden lmao
Hillary Clinton: Biden has 'great choices' for running mate to help defeat 'wannabe authoritarian'  via
Biden isn’t powerful. He’s impotent. Acting like he is is just deflection
So it’s ok for trump to be racist bc Biden used to be like Trump. Works at a MAGA rallies of the intellectually deprived
Predictably, the "science" won't be taken as fact unless Biden wins
What? I'm saying it will cease to be a story if Biden is elected
The irony is both of those are going to disappear if Biden wins
Duh.  Nearly everyone prefers Biden....only Russia and maybe Israel prefer Trump.
#Health Biden campaign, women’s groups are working to blunt sexist attacks on his vice…
You picked two gay men who don’t hold office. I’m not gay, and I “understand” perfectly. They have way less than influence over the FDA than Joe Biden would as President, or whomever he picks as secretary of HHS, or literally any sitting member of Congress, for example.
Anyone with a brain in their head could figure out that he is running for President as some ploy to get voters away from Biden. And for no other reason.   He is no more qualified to be 'President' than the current bozo Cheeto Jesus in the White House
But also, I’m fairly certain that a landslide victory for Biden doesn’t remove trump from office…
Damn good piece. So a line got worded wrong, but Maureen included both Hillary &amp; Sarah Palin in their struggles with white male bullshit.  No Wrist Corsages, Please

This is what I hear all time. His followers, the cult. Yet Biden followers arent turning a blind eye?
And Biden isnt?
No stories on the Fox reaction to Biden's "blacks are all the same" comments? I suppose you'd have to admit it happened first.
No, PR person, you didn't make those comments. Biden did. He needs to address them personally, not hide behind a tweet written for him by his handlers.
I never said I support Trump. I also do not support Biden. I want a true strict conservative option. As an independent with mostly conservative ideals, I found I can not trust or respect liberals and progressives.
Maybe Biden will reverse a wrong. Taiwan was settled 6000 years ago by indigenous people. Not Chinese. Recognize Taiwan as an independent country. What’s China going to do, really. Our economies are codependent. F em. A bad decision a few many years ago needs reversing. Our Ally.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot   You know what makes me moist? Campaign funding request emails. Get the special sticky feeling every time you open your Gmail by throwing some coin Uncle Joe's way. Together we can depose Donald
You get on Rogan and seem normal. Then you do a 180 on fox and friends and speak hyperbole. Biden doesn't believe in de-funding the police nor will anyone get their taxes doubled. What are you talking about?
Get Trump out of office. I support Biden
You're not alone this older woman in Fargo, ND , is voting Biden and blue all the way.
Trump lost all three debates to Hillary. They were not close.  #Debates2020He thinks he's talking about Biden.
It's understandable that Mr. Biden has no idea of the stark difference between absentee and bulk-mail voting. But the people running his Twitter feed certainly do and are trying to confuse the issue for Americans who, by large majorities, want honest, safe, in-person balloting.
If Joe Biden wins this November, what about everyone who feels Hillary Clinton is their president?
Neighbor. Voted for trump 2016. Now he's voting Biden, and he's talking to his family about Biden. And he asked me how to pronounce Kamala's name.  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Oh, so your "poll" shows Biden winning? I'm sorry, I thought you said "pole", as in North Pole, where an imaginary Santa lives in children's imaginations, completely made up, just like Biden winning in your so-called #poll!!

Do you think having Kamala Harris on the ticket helps or hurts Joe Biden’s run for president?
C’mon Kev.....I’m no Trump supporter, but do you really think Biden/Harris can beat him? The Dems should have spent the last years putting together a ticket that had a chance. This ain’t it, and you’re looking at 4 more years of Trump. Sorry
Craziness. Biden looks weak and pitiful.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum."
That’s cute stole it from a Biden fan page probably and still couldn’t show me the evidence where Trumps an atheist. That’s what a matter with liberals
You must not remember in 2016 when Trump was elected and all you liberals were crying and protesting because y’all are the losers and Biden will be defeated in November
There are too many supporters of trump that are capable of looking past the wrong things he does and either make things up or deny he does anything wrong.  And too many still are content with allowing these aggregious acts so long as it allows that darn Biden not to win.

Biden’s not gonna do anything because he won’t be president
Exactly why testing for H1N1 was suspended back in the Obama/Biden years.
People thinking Biden is gonna be President is pathetic.
So he is saying Biden is more active than him?
I knew I was going to like a Biden/Harris ticket, I did not know I would love it this much!
To my Christian followers, don't be fooled by "Catholic" Biden or "Baptist" Harris. You only have to take a look at Trump's history and track record to know that he is the candidate that Jesus would endorse.  #TrumpIsTheRealChristian #Jesus4Trump
Biden did not kill himself, just like Epstein
So your hoping Biden can’t for fill his duties as president due to cognitive deterioration? Hmmm...
Hopefully, with a new Biden/Harris ticket, we can start to tackle global warming...and keep it going into the future.
LIKE and RETWEET if you agree that Biden's choice of Kamala Harris just proves how desperate he is to win.
She sold out your race. Supporting her and Biden is a clown move.
I AM BEHIND YOU BIDEN/HARRIS 100%.
My personal preference for VP was  but today's announcement gave me the first bit of excitement I've felt toward this election/the Biden campaign.
Joe Biden has officially picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.   I can get behind this.
This looks like GREAT news for Trump! I'm assuming that the +7 Biden means that's how many Biden electoral votes have gone over to Trump, right? If so, that's fantastic!!  #goTrump #RedWave2020
I meant Biden. I'm talking about Biden.
JUST IN: Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his VP, making her the first Black woman on major party presidential ticket. #Decision2020
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate and has started telling people close to him as he nears the most consequential announcement of his political career.
The presumptive Democratic nominee in this year’s presidential election has previously said he will choose a woman to be his running mate.
I hate Biden and the establishment Democrats so this isn't what you think it is. But I applaud your effort for trying. 😆
You might be surprised by Joe Biden's pick for VP, but you won't be as surprised as Joe Biden.
Exactly!! Why do men always get shut out of political discussions? It's time for us to take our power back!
In a 2011 op-ed, then-Vice President Joe Biden was extolling payroll tax cuts as "real money for real people," calling the cuts "extra money" that Americans "can use to help with bills...Biden wrote that payroll tax cuts will fuel the economy, "spurring growth and creating jobs."
HE KNOWS THAT. Of course he knows that. How much do you want to bet that most of Trump's supposed "gaffes" are just him really subtly poking fun at Biden not being all there?

I think as soon as Biden announces his VP, trump is going to dump you and pick a real "wife" person to back him up.
Two hours Joe Biden won't waste while President.
If you want a good laugh just watch all of Biden’s speeches and interviews. Biden is a clown 🤡

Might be a bad comparison. Let’s ask Biden “daaaaabaaaaa hydroxicorawho compared to payroll rakes..... maybe aaaaa and in fact aaaaaaa, I better not say anything cause biyicle might fall with alligators in the aaaaaaaaaaa.....” never mind! 😂
You must be related to Biden.I live in Bismarck.  Go Biden!!!
I will vote in person. Normally there are about 4 or 5 people voting at about 6pm where I vote. I will wear my mask and vote. God be with us and please help Biden wins.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤞🏻
Paycheck Protection was not your plan. Congress Passed it. Donnie you take US all as fools.   You did not build the greatest economy in history. You rode on the great economic foundations of the Great Obama &amp; Biden Team!  Trump is going to ride the market down! It is way too high
Donald Trump and Mike Pence have been terrible for the past 4 years! You allowed them to run this country down to hell. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have to repair all the damage you allowed!! So sit down and be quiet.
My dream is that at Biden's inauguration, Trump is handcuffed and perp walked off the stage right after Biden swears in.
I guess I'm alright with Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris as his running mate.   If I'm being completely honest though, she wasn't my first choice. I was hoping he'd pick Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

I’m glad to report that this will cost her the 2024 election even if she wins with Biden. Time to start fighting for a strong progressive challenger is now!

Our Country is Collapsing under Trump's Total LACK OF LEADERSHIP! If Biden loses, America DIES! (The man below Knows this is TRUE, but he will 🔥 burn this country Down to try to finish his Demolition of the USA!)
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum."

I think you miss spelled expansion. You meant depression right? And yes he did run the poor policies that Biden and Obama implemented into the ground.

Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
As VP nominee she has to get her own. Besides, I doubt she wants to be groped by Biden.
Woke up to your tweet about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s running mate. Was once told to think of the Boy George song, to pronounce her name correctly 1/2
Woke up to a tweet by Kara Goldin about Kamala Harris. She is now Biden’s running mate. Puts me in mind of the Boy George song ‘Kama Kama Kama Kama Kama Chameleon’ 🎶
You mean Erick Erickson wasn’t going to vote for Biden?
I hope they perp walk Trump off the stage at Biden's inaugural?
You're right, Trump/Biden is a throwback to Harding/Coolidge, except Harding was smarter and much less corrupt than Trump and Coolidge had more personality than Mikey.
And while VP debates rarely matter that much, this one, with Biden picking more of a successor than a typical Veep, demands a performance that far outclasses those that underscored her failed attempt at securing the Democratic nomination in the first place.
While she might well outperform him on the debate stage, this idea that she’ll give him the ol’ one-two “as a prosecutor” is a stretch. It didn’t work against Warren, or Sanders, or Biden, or even Gabbard.
What it does show is that if Biden would win the real power would be in the shadows, not sure who it is but it’s not Harris.
This was my take no matter who Biden picked as VP.
Welcome to Joe Biden's America . . . .
"Ms. Harris, a pragmatic moderate....."
in 2019 you stated that you believe the victims of Joe Biden. Do you not believe them anymore or are you just immoral?
I just think she’s inappropriate for the position when her state is in chaos. If you think Biden &amp; Harris are the best the DNC can do then there’s an issue. 😳
Whoohoo! Biden/Harris 2020! Great choice  Happy dancing about
Glad your happy...as a lifelong Democrat, I am so disappointed in Joe picking her. I will vote for Biden but later I refuse to vote for her...she will not bring this country together anymore than Trump has

Really disappointed in  . With clips of his speeches of him falling asleep and messing up words this is not what America needs. We need the Joe Biden that was VP of Obama not this guy I see all the time. I like Joe Biden but not like this.
I want to put up a Biden yard sign but honestly worry what kind of bullshit that might be inviting this year.
Anyone find it absolutely ridiculous that the media is whining about  doing a presser from his club and are totally ok without Biden not leaving his basement.  He still invited the entire press to be there and took more questions from the left media than others
