Biden is definitely not that candidate. There's a huge chunk of people turned off by Biden's history. Those people will either go grudgingly to Trump or not vote. That's who Jorgensen wins. This election is too important to split the vote with Biden. Maybe he can run in 2028.
Biden didn't write it, but he claims credit for it and he laid the groundwork.   And Trump signed its renewal this year. They're both awful candidates.
You're not too familiar with Biden's career before Vice President, are you?
Some guy on Twitter would almost certainly be a better choice than Biden.
Why do you think she has no chance? If it's just because you think not enough people will vote for her, then you should be committing to vote for her to help fix that.  It's not a protest vote. If she weren't running I wouldn't vote. Trump &amp; Biden are both threats to our country.
No, but I would gladly wait much longer to vote FOR  Trump and Biden are both awful candidates. I'll be voting for an excellent one instead.  #LetHerSpeak #EndQualifiedImmunity #EndTheDrugWar #EndTheATF #VoteGold2020
This began pre-2016. Trump rallied people mad at how Obama ran things. Many are rightly upset but deceived about who/what Trump is/does. If we elect Biden or reelect Trump we're going to continue this toxic cycle because neither has anything good ideas except "not the other guy".
should we question if Biden is more sane than trump
Don't vote for either, vote for  Biden isn't just a fiddly old man who says silly things, he wrote, supported, and still defends some of the most harmful legislation passed during his 40 years in Congress. He shows us who he is, we should believe him.  #JoNotJoe
is the only viable candidate who's a good person. Many people will be peacefully protesting this weekend to get her into the debates with Trump and Biden. America deserves a 3rd party, especially this year.    #VoteGold2020 #LetHerSpeak
this was the good part; you wore a mask...then it went crazy wen you basically said Biden was the antichrist
joe biden is an idiot,,, go back to the basement
I did not realize there was so much anti-Joe Biden sentiment in the leftist community. I think with all of the social movements happening and his flexibility and compassion, he could make a great president.
....and "all your guns will immediately taken away without warning".... how can anyone on his team attack Biden for mental issues?
Here's the full context:   Trump doesn't care about the 2nd or 4th amendments. He's an awful candidate just like Biden.
I'm fed up with people flashing the Ron Paul badge like it means they're an authority on something. No, your past support of Paul doesn't mean you're right about supporting Biden. It means you gave up and ran back to the problem parties. I don't take winning advice from quitters.
We need to stop voting for bad candidates, not continue like an addict saying they can stop whenever they want but they just need a hit to get through work.  Stop voting for bad candidates. Is Biden a bad candidate? Yes he is, so don't vote for him. Same with Trump.
It will never be "the year". We're going to continue on the death spiral until we start voting 3rd party en masse. If Biden gets elected we'll see Trump 2.0 in 2024 &amp; it won't be the year. If Trump wins we'll have Mega Biden to "fix" 8 years of tantrums &amp; it won't be the year.
No police and no guns? Is this an ad in favor of Biden?
Biden is a devout catholic. Trump can‚Äôt name a single verse in the bible and says he‚Äôs never asked God for forgiveness. Who do you think is the real Christian?
Still not calling out Biden‚Äôs racist comments eh
Yes it is. Dr. Jorgensen is on the ballot and you're free to vote for her.  We'll never have real change without changing how we vote. Biden and Trump have shown their true colors, and millions of Americans don't want either. This election is too important to vote for them.
Biden &amp; Trump are terrible candidates. I'm voting for  She won't try to "put our country back together": how it was before Trump is the reason we got him. She would make real change for real people, chiefly by restoring the fed. govt to its constitutional limits.
Nobody should waste their vote on Trump or Biden.  is the only viable candidate who's not a creep or a pedophile, and her policies are great too.
Why would you waste a vote on Trump or Biden? They're both awful candidates. Do you think Republicans won't try to impeach him over something just concerning enough to be impeachable but then fail to get sufficient evidence? We're going to keep oscillating between bad candidates.
"Let‚Äôs not mince words, a vote for Biden is a vote for seeing the dentist twice a year."
Horrible job of president tweety'sthat Joe Biden is beating the crap out of him in every relevant poll.  Trump is a clown.  Go Joe!
Victims won't pay for my right, because I won't shoot them unless they try to harm me or someone close to me. Stop trying to abridge civil rights because of criminals.  Besides, where would you keep the oracles for your Minority Report program where Biden won't fondle them?
My 10/22 has a folding stock. Biden's going to Minority Report me, isn't he? üò∞
Not only that, but during Obama‚Äòs administration the H1N1 virus had over 60 million cases. Way more deaths too. Yeah, let‚Äôs put Biden back in office. It went so well the first time
if Biden can pronounce Yosemite on the first or even second try, he's got my vote
I bet Biden can pronounce Yosemite on the first try
I bet Biden can pronounce Yosemite on the first try
I bet Biden can pronounce Yosemite on the first try
No, I'm not OK with that. Electing the architect of the police state just isn't the solution. We're going to keep oscillating between awful candidates of different parties until we stop voting for awful candidates.  Why do you think a Biden presidency would magically fix things?
Biden wrote &amp; voted for the laws, confirmed judges, &amp; sat idly as VP for the precedents that are enabling Trump's overreaches. Why in the world do you think a Biden Presidency would improve anything?  I'll be voting for  to use my little influence for real change.
Biden is an authoritarian who doesn't respect the Constitution &amp; its limits on the federal govt. He's an awful candidate. I don't agree with or trust him.  Dr. Jorgensen has great ideas &amp; no muddy past. Getting the LP to 5% will be a greater victory than electing Biden or Trump.
They need to discuss letting  into the debates, whether  likes it or not. Utahns want choices. Biden and Trump do not represent our values. #LetHimSpeak #LetHerSpeak #LetHerDebate
‚ÄúWhat do you mean by strategy? I don‚Äôt think Donald Trump wakes up and says, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs my strategy. Let me tweet out something.‚Äô ... He believes the way he interacts and communicates is what got him elected and he‚Äôs going to continue to do that.‚Äù  ü™Ñ
It would just be an exhausting slapfight without  and other candidates there. I won't even watch it if it's just Trump and Biden. Nobody wins that debate, they both just look awful. #LetHerSpeak #OpenTheDebates
Most of what Dr. Jorgensen has promised to do could be done unilaterally by the President, like auditing the Pentagon, abolishing ATF, withdrawing the troops. She actually understands the limits of the office, unlike Trump and Biden. I would never waste my vote on either of them.
I'll be voting for  The big 2 parties shouldn't get our votes just for not being the other guy. Biden and Trump are both awful.
Getting Trump out is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden, and if we do we'll just see Trump 2.0 running in 4 years.  This election is too important for either to be running. We need real change to break this abusive cycle. I'll be voting for  #LetHerSpeak
is the best candidate, by far. I won't be giving Trump or Biden my vote just because the other guy is awful. #LetHerSpeak #VoteGold2020 #OpenTheDebates
No,  is the only candidate capable of helping us recover and become more robust so a simple virus doesn't do this to us again. Don't believe it? You should pressure Trump and Biden should debate her to prove it. #LetHerSpeak
That wouldn't matter if we had 3rd party candidates there to wreck his policies despite his platitudes.  would destroy Trump and Biden in a debate, even if they had teleprompters, because their policies and records are real bad. #LetHerSpeak #LetHerDebate
Haha and Biden is?  You just get to this planet?
Biden wrote the laws, voted for the judges, and was VP during the precedents that enable Trump's authoritarian overreaches. Why do you think a Biden presidency would be any better?  I'll vote for Jo Jorgensen, who committed to veto deficit spending and stop abusing the 2001 AUMF.
and what was it your were accusing Hunter Biden of....? profiting on his family name I think it was
Biden wrote the laws, voted for the judges, and sat as VP for the precedents enabling Trump's authoritarian overreaches.  Why do you think a Biden Presidency would be any better?
It's ironic that you're letting someone you view as a fascist have total control over your vote.  Do you think Biden is a good candidate? He wrote the laws, voted for the judges, and sat as VP for the precedents enabling Trump's authoritarian overreaches. He's a bad candidate.
Sure, and how did he get there? People kept voting for worse and worse candidates. Don't trade your water bucket for a gas can just because other people are adding to the fire.  We would be worse off after a Biden Presidency.
She's not even included in most polls, or they misname her as "other". That's the problem we're fighting  If we reelect Trump, we'll just face Biden 2.0 in 2024. This election is too important for either of them to be running. Vote for real change to end America's death spiral.
There's loads of time. #LetHerSpeak in the debates and millions of people will know who she is and appreciate her policies.  But if she can't win, she can get us to 5% of the vote to secure FEC funding for the Libertarian Party. That's a greater victory than electing Trump/Biden.
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after we scale back the federal government so much that it doesn't matter who the President is.
Umm. Just say okay. She need that light. Cover your face.
A vote for Dr. Jorgensen is a vote for Jo Jorgensen, not Trump or Biden. Your math is way off.  Trump voters got us Trump, not anybody else.
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028.
How come you don‚Äôt have shit to say about Clinton or Biden I mean are F‚Äôn serious
Biden isn't good by any reasonable standard, and Trump's authoritarian rampage is made possible by Biden's bad bills and fanning the flames of war. They're both terrible, terrible candidates.  It's time for real change. We need  in the White House.
Biden &amp; Trump are both horrendous candidates and this election is too important for them to be running.  Vote for  Dr. Jorgensen is the only candidate who's commuted to reducing the power of the President while in office so who gets elected can't hurt us so much.
Getting Dr. Jorgensen 5% of the vote would be a much greater victory than electing Trump or Biden.
No. He and Biden are terrible candidates who don't value human rights.  Vote for  instead. Dr. Jo Jorgensen is committed to protecting all of your rights, all the time, instead of selectively ignoring or prioritizing them for political gain. #VoteGold2020
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr. Jorgensen shrinks the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who wins can't hurt us all so much. Biden is an awful candidate, change my mind.
Ugh..drunk. stupid autocorrect. Now I actually SOUND drunk...üòÇ
I'm currently passed out from being blackout drink, apparently...
Biden will never tie his own hands.  is the only candidate who has promised to limit her own power while in office. She's the only viable candidate that will bring lasting change. #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica
You know Biden wrote or was VP for the passage of the laws enabling Trump's authoritarianism, right? Obama's NDAA, Biden's Tough on Crime bill, the Patriot Act, the open-ended 2001 AUMF. All have Biden's name on them. It's silly to think a Biden Presidency would be really better.
It's not one less for him, because he's an awful candidate. I would never vote for him. He's not entitled just because the Republican candidate is awful too.  Stop voting for bad candidates. If we get Trump again it's Trump voters' fault. If we get Biden it's Biden voters' fault.
Even if you live in a swing state, your vote can count toward the 5% needed to get the Libertarian Party federal funding. If we elect Biden this year we'll get Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years unless we have a healthy 3rd party to fight for us.  Let's all stop voting for bad candidates.
No, vote for Libertarian candidates. If you favor limited government and personal responsibility that's the only consistent choice. Biden is a warmongering authoritarian who inflated government power tremendously during his career. He's not a good candidate.  is.
SUR is silent about endorsement but McMullin implies support for Biden, and the Lincoln Project shills for him proudly. That's not a conservative, limited government position. If the plan is to replace the GOP with something Bidenesque it's a bad plan. Join  instead.
If we elect Biden instead of a good candidate this year, we're going to get Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years. The only way to stop the cycle of abuse is to stop voting for it.
Plus you're saying it takes votes away from Trump and Biden like that's a bad thing. They're the people I'd trust the least to act well with my vote.  Stop voting for awful candidates and encouraging people to waste their votes on the duopoly. There are options.
Joe has had his day in the sun. I'll be voting for  Not only is she not Trump, she's also an awesome candidate unlike Biden.  #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica #JoNotJoe #LetHerSpeak
and they are complaining about Hunter Biden?
That's not how math works. Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating, just vote for good candidates.  But even if Dr. Jorgensen doesn't win, getting her 5% of the vote to secure FEC funding is much more of a victory than electing Trump or Biden.  #VoteGoldToSaveAmerica
Getting Jorgensen to just 5% of the vote to get FEC funding will be a huge victory. That's much more important than electing Biden/Trump, two sides of the same awful coin.  And if we can get as much as 34% there's a chance to have a good President. Join up and make real change.
She's gonna be pulling Tulis Gabbard's left and right all night. Trump and Biden have awful records.
And Biden is still an awful candidate.  I'm going to take this as an endorsement for  the Libertarian candidate that your guy is too scared to debate. #LetHerSpeak
if you are an ally to those who have experienced sexual assault and still plan on voting for trump OR biden... i- i don‚Äôt care if u think writing in or voting for a third party ‚Äúis a vote for trump‚Äù u are contradicting yourself
Biden does support Trump, that's why their presidencies would be so similar.  Vote for  if you want real positive change.
I sent you video of evidence to the contrary. Trump (like the NRA) is full of platitudes but when push comes to shove they compromise. He's a New York liberal through and through.  And yes, Biden is also awful.
Many were left scratching their heads by "Trump‚Äôs decision to brag about killing a regulation that few voters have [ever] heard of....[at the same time he's trailing] Joe Biden by 10 points."  House adopts Ocasio-Cortez housing bias amendments to block HUD
Straight from the donkey's mouth:   Donald Trump doesn't care about our rights. Like Biden, he gives lip service and occasional platitudes and "what about the other guy?" Vote Libertarian if you really value your rights. Dr. Jorgensen would abolish the ATF.
Why is nobody talking about the missing 11%?   is out there for everyone who wants a good candidate to vote for instead of warmongering, debt-happy, corporatist, constitution-hating Trump and Biden. This election is too important for them to be running.
"This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running" -    Libertarians will make waves this year. Why not endorse a good candidate instead of an octogenarian warmonger who fanned the flames of mass incarceration and endless war and debt?
This election is too important for Trump and Biden to be running. Maybe they can try again in 2028 after Dr.  scales back the federal government to its constitutionally enumerated powers so who wins the Presidency can't hurt anyone so much.
Nah. We only "don't have a chance" because defeatists and shills keep saying so and don't report on our candidates or include them in polls. I'm going to use my little vote to move the Libertarian Party closer to 5%, a far greater victory than electing Trump or Biden. #VoteGold
No. Duverger's Law is a self-perpetuating historical observation, not a rule. If enough people vote for a candidate she will win.  But even if she doesn't, getting the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can have a level playing field is more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
Biden would probably pull an FDR knockoff and try to new deal us out of it. No thank you.
Let‚Äôs just wait and see the debates...if they are held...Biden has been in politics 50 years and has done üí©
Try to list some reasons we should remove Trump without touching federal powers enabled and supported by Biden.  The problem is how much power the Oval Office has, not who sits in it. Dr. Jorgensen would scale the federal government back to its constitutionally enumerated powers.
Getting the Libertarian Party to 5% of the vote would be a far greater victory than electing Biden or Trump.  When do we stop crawling back to our old masters and start voting for good candidates? I say now. Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating.
Getting a 3rd party to 5% would be a much more significant victory than crawling back to D or R yet again. Biden and Trump are both awful candidates, one is just awful more loudly than the other. There's a reason they're keeping Biden locked up.
GND is absolutely unsustainable economically, making it impossible to implement. Simply allowing nuclear would do far more.  When, during his vice presidency, did Biden speak up against the warmongering? Hindsight is 20/20, I want someone who can see wrongness in the moment.
* GND is awful and unrealistic * Iran deal is interventionism, no thanks * Biden claims proudly to have written Patriot Act &amp; voted for the 2001 AUMF, &amp; was VP while Obama expanded our wars- he will not scale them back * Jorgensen would remove all restrictions on voluntary unions
It's literally not. If she gets enough votes, she'll win.  But even if she doesn't win, I won't regret voting for her to help get the Libertarian Party to 5% so we can get federal funding next election. That's much more of a victory than electing Biden or Trump.
Can you step me through that math? Duverger's Law is not math, it's a historical observation. This year is like no other year in history and people are fed up.  Biden wrote and/or voted for the worst legislation we had in his tenure. He's not a good candidate. #VoteGold2020
Why would someone support Biden?
If you want Biden, then put together a better campaign in the next 4 years to contend with Jorgensen.  The buck stops with you when it comes to your vote. Don't blame others if you vote for a bad candidate, &amp; don't blame a bad candidate winning on those that didn't vote for them.
It's almost like they're from the same party as Biden ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  If you stop voting for the same 2 parties, we won't have a 2 party system.  Duverger's Law is self-perpetuating. Stop enabling the broken system and vote for real positive change.
Your opinion is wrong but I respect your right to have and share it üòâ  Dr. Jorgensen is a great candidate, or at least streets ahead of Biden or Trump.  Stop supporting the duopoly. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump and this election is too important.  Vote for real change.Come on, President Trump is fine regarding his cognitive skills.  Why do you refuse to acknowledge Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline?  Track how many times he says ‚Äúanyway‚Äù and get back to me.
You didn‚Äôt respond to my observation regarding Biden.  It is a sincere apolitical question.
anyone gonna talk about how trump doesn‚Äôt even have a reelection plan? straight up he‚Äôs just like vote for me again ‚Äúmaga‚Äù like you do realize that you didn‚Äôt make America great again the first 4 years right? That‚Äôs embarrassing. Biden is out here with 40 planned out plans
ashamed to be from Utah sometimes. If you think this is right, you love dictatorships! You're a fake patriot who picks and chooses amendments. Are you cool with Biden making life sentences for not wearing masks when he's elected?
Please be objective.  And I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre buddies even if we see things differently. I have a question for you.  Are you at all concerned about Biden‚Äôs decline in his cognitive skills?  He‚Äôs a nice guy, but it concerns me.  I wonder if the Democrats made the right choice.
At this point, Biden could choose Goofy and I'd still vote for him. We'll all be dead or be wishing we were under 4 more years of Trump.
I don‚Äôt use the AP as my news source.  Biden apologized to President Trump for criticizing the President‚Äôs China travel ban.
I don‚Äôt get it! He claims Biden is against religion while at the same time calling Biden deranged for praying?! ü§î
Why? Is it because he's the great Statesman, Joe Biden, or because he's not Trump. Can't fathom the former, so it must be the latter.
Can‚Äôt seem to recall Biden saying he was against God.  My guess is Biden has read more of the Bible than Trump.
hey Bo, ask Rush who he thinks the notable exceptions Biden was talking about are.
Lol. Last thing trump wants to do is debate. That‚Äôs why they keep putting out the lie Biden won‚Äôt debate, when in fact he‚Äôs agreed to 3.
My grandma, who has been gone 14 years, will be voting for Biden again. The retirement home she lives at is very nice and they go ahead and vote for all 500 of their residents. It is. Ice because the residents don‚Äôt have to be bothered. Also, their vote keeps counting after death

You are out of touch.  President Trump lead the passage of criminal justice reform which resulted in the release of many Black Americans from prison.  By the way, it was Joe Biden‚Äôs actions as a Senator which got many of them locked up for years and years.  Check your history.
The only way Biden wins is if trump drops out lol. Oh wait, you forgot about  who will definitely win if trump drops out lol.
Funny how you guys make such a big deal about a mark on Trump‚Äôs hand but stay totally silent about Biden‚Äôs mental decline.
Why am I squirmingly embarrassed every time I watch one of Biden's word salads? LOL  Yet, here I sit, squirming.
üòÇ Biden is hiding out in some basement somewhere and can barely eat pudding at this point ( a little exaggerated but not by much)
Can we just stop for a moment and appreciate the fact that we are back to arguing with morons about basketball again and not arguing about masks, or Trump, or Biden...
And Hillary Clinton &amp; Nancy Pelosi just endorsed Biden. Can any of them be trusted???
Imagine being so shitty at your job that you get fired and replaced by Joe Biden...
Watch Biden‚Äôs press conference. But you gonna say ‚Äúrigged‚Äù, right? I‚Äôm happy he ‚Äúrigs‚Äù better than this fool. Ok with that: it‚Äôs planning.... something only Putin dies in this admin.
We expect an early night, with president elect Biden taking a victory lap.
Wait, are you insinuating that poor people are minorities? Is that a Freudian slip like when Biden said ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù?Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
It‚Äôs a great point. And it‚Äôs obviously one that Joe Biden understands well.....wait....

Why is Joe Biden allowed to go to the games?
"did you hear the gaffe that Biden said yesterday?" Have you not been listening to our current president for the last 3+ years?
Just read his clarification on what he really meant.  Is it just me or did he just reiterate his initial statement? Haha reading a Joe Biden quote is way harder than hearing him say it.

Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
If Biden's VP pick is not Kamala, you'll vote for Trump?  That's not a very smart plan.   Just thought you should know.
Does he remember who it is? #Biden
So did you not vote for the green tax incentives that helped his company grow, or did you forget, like Biden
I am beginning to think Biden does not have a stutter or cognitive issues.   He has a shock collar on and his handlers are zapping him every time he is about to say something stupid.     Sometimes they miss though
The right person for the job. The right pick for the times.   CNN: Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs.   via
Wait!!  Did Joe Robgan switch sides??? Is he voting for Biden now??
Umm. You need to research Biden‚Äôs previous comments
Plus - does she have any name recognition at all? Seems like a lose-lose for Biden
Biden must be a pretty powerful Titan If he has the ability to hurt a god. Zeus blood in those genes????
If he wins the nation as we know it is over, I really believe that. Not because of Biden, but because the far left own Biden. Assuming democrats win that also means they hold the house and win the senate (most likely) green new deal, single payer, abortion at birth it‚Äôs coming
Every American should vote for Biden. How could there be any other option?
Joe is an expert at the whole ‚Äòsneak up behind you and shamelessly smell you technique‚Äô.  Trumps a bit taller than Biden‚Äôs usual victims though.
One of Biden‚Äôs potential running mates is Tammy Duckworth.  If we ever have a President Duckworth it will be the first President to have a name from Ducktales since President Mallard Fillmore. ü¶Ü

Negative. Sweetheart your incorect.   B o.  Biden is Marxist  socialist communist if want a Marxist president he the for love  vote Donald j. Trump he for constitution  nationalism   real freedom that s Donald trump
Haha well that‚Äôs kinda what Joe Biden implied, if you know one you know them all.  So it makes sense he thinks like that. Haha your comment is too good 10/10.
My clinical director just said that she can‚Äôt stand to listen to Biden speak and that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something wrong with that guy. All of this will clear up in November.‚Äù Wait...WTF?! I think I have to resign now.  #Biden2020
Who does Biden want to vote for him? Genuinely... Whose vote has he tried to earn?
Oh, and a Biden administration would throw a fit over RBG's replacement (or one of the others) ruling against their political agenda as well. I totally get that.   Maybe if both sides got better at writing laws/orders......
Low information voters will fall for things like this, when the report is dropped by Barr it will be untrue, misleading and downright disgusting. But this is going to happen with both investigations before November 3rd, we should be prepared! That is why Biden needs Harris as VP.
Actually the Democrats because they have nothing but corruption to hide. Biden is a part of that. Trump certainly did not need to take a cognitive test because he plays 4 dimensional chess. If Biden wasn‚Äôt afraid of having a cognitive test he would take one but he won‚Äôt.
Yes for sure.  That is what they are doing!  Trying to take black votes away from Biden!
lol texas would only have been a swing state with bernie as the nom. Biden doesn't have that crossover appeal
They should have called this video Ridin‚Äô with Biden  I‚Äôll see myself out
Was it the APWU that endorsed Biden?
Oh I totally get that. I just look at it as who can I vote for and feel good about it. That‚Äôs not Trump or Biden.
I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
Are you even aware that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are two different people?
So either you‚Äôre ridin‚Äô with Biden or you‚Äôre hitchhiking with MAGA. One is working toward a racist, fascist state and the other is not. The choice is not fair, but it is absolutely clear. /rant
Be honest that you‚Äôre okay with kids in cages and unmarked vans disappearing protestors as long as YOU don‚Äôt have to say you voted for Biden
I realize that ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt a fascist‚Äù is not a great reason to vote for him. That‚Äôs a reallly low bar we‚Äôve set. But he‚Äôs the candidate we have right now. There isn‚Äôt another candidate who has a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell  at taking the White House
Biden has MANY FLAWS. But he is someone we can work with. He is someone who can be pushed further left once he‚Äôs in office (especially if we can hold the house and flip the senate!)
Seriously. I understand Biden is not the leftist candidate many of us wanted. But do you think that another 4 years of T*ump is going to achieve the ends you want? You think T*ump is going to legalize marajuna and give everyone free college tuition?
I‚Äôm so sick of this shit. Republicans are actively building a fascist state and stupid motherfuckets are like, ‚Äúyeah, but Biden doesn‚Äôt believe in Medicare for all...sO iT‚Äôs tHe SamE.‚Äù Fuck you and the privelidged horse you rode in on.

Why would delaying school in Utah have any impact on the presidential election? All church leadership could come out and say to vote for Biden and Pres. Trump would still win here. This type of stuff just serves as a rallying cry for the ‚Äúother‚Äù side.
And, Joe Biden had literally a lifetime in government and still complains about the same problems.
I'm not even a Trump supporter but if he would've just made that cocaine comment to a black reporter, he'd never hear the end of it.   Face the truth, Biden is a creep and has said plenty of racist things over his career and the last few months.

At the airport, in the past month...0 Biden logos, at least 10-15 Trump each day.
And I would vote for a potted plant before voting for Joe Biden. üéçüåæ
All Biden has to do is let your old man keep talking.
Well I donated $1000 to Joe Biden.
Don, your comment sounds like it came from Joe Biden. The Pebble project poses no harm to Bristol Bay. China would love us to shut down mining in America!
Biden will win Florida.
Noticing an interesting trend in bots both here and on my FB TL that they're not just attempting to sway moderates in support of Trump, but now also looking to sway progressives away from voting for Biden.
Biden vs Trump 2020. The dementia Olympics. Who will win the gold medal!?
I‚Äôve seen so many people saying they‚Äôll vote for Biden based only on the fact that he‚Äôs not trump it‚Äôs insane.

Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
he‚Äôs running against tRump. but I‚Äôve always liked Biden and he‚Äôs for people
I didn't vote for anybody. Kinda feels the same way with Biden, but WTF I can't let one of the worst people stay president. I will vote for Biden, but not because I like him, support him but because my arm is being twisted. This is not a viable long term solution for the country.
honestly...it seems like he's trying to fuck biden up. whoever this endorsement was supposed to draw in to support Biden, the backlash from the right will be disproportionate
Just because wall street is doing well doesn't mean main street is. You've mishandled the virus and tanked the economy and Biden is the only hope we have right now.
As you know, #BenedictDonald isn't going to say anything about it on day 39, 40 nor on the day Biden is inaugurated.   Such is life in America while this serial traitor is stinking up the Oval Office. #DonTheConRussianPawn!
No matter what u feel... Trump is loosing with landslide margin. He is a psychopath... Go biden go
I vote for total humiliation of Trump.  Just wish I was more confident Joe Biden is the man for that job.
And it's not like there is anyway Biden will win over Trump. Even if he magically gets the popular vote, the electoral college will likely prop up Trump again. The DNC doesn't care if Biden gets elected or not.
I'm not gonna fucking vote for Biden either. I have a tough time that shit will matter soon.
I will crawl through the Sahara Desert without a drop of water or walk through a snake filled swamp to vote for Biden!
And btw, Trump signed into law a bi-partisan bill that reversed some of the worst parts of the Biden bill.
That's why everyone is going to vote for Biden
Maybe Biden's slogan should be Make America Great Again.
LCD? Yeah, I hated when he said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Oh, wait, that quote was from Biden, who wrote the law that increased black incarceration  2 1/2 times and did nothing to reduce black incarceration as VP to a black president
You'll see Biden's base on November 3rd
Biden has literally promised that nothing will change.  We are pretty much screwed.
If we can swallow Biden as the nominee, we might as well accept anybody he picks for VP and cabinet members.  But really, no Medicare for All?  Seriously?  In a pandemic?
This Republican is voting for Biden! #YesWeCanAgain
She seems to be even further left than Biden, so that affects my choice.
OK, who knew that Biden grew up in the same town as The Office?
What keeps me up at night? Joe Biden‚Äôs name appearing in an Epstein document a few weeks before the election. I really don‚Äôt want Trump to win, and don‚Äôt think he will, but we‚Äôve got to adopt a better way of choosing our overlords than who (of 2) separated fewer kids from parents
And vote for Joe Biden
What could possibly go wrong there?  Is Biden that intent on telling progressives to go away and get lost?
Biden head shake is a gift and we will tell you Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Clinton was more competent but was viewed in a negative light by more people. Conservatives don‚Äôt view Biden as much of a threat.
It always shows "this tweet is unavailable." Did Joe Biden block you????
Why did you stop the audio.  Had you continued: Stern: Did you want to bang her? Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôve never been into that. They‚Äôve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category. There's more but out of words...
The election between Hillary and Trump and Biden and Trump is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
Sounds like  owes Joe Biden an apology.
Trump better have his bags packed by Inauguration Day.   Biden‚Äôs White House doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúextended checkout time‚Äù
Biden would have been a 90‚Äôs Republican
Joe Biden needs to go and announce his VIP pick so we can vote for her already
Biden ought to commit to establishing a task force to energetically undo every one of Trump's executive actions that can be reversed.
Let a Trump run your company, but I‚Äôll vote Biden to run the country.
Still not going to vote for Biden.
And I'll unmute others when they stop trying to convince me that Joe Biden is the savior.   BTW, our tomato plants are fucking amazing.Defenders of Two Corinthians, unite!
They are aggressively shoring up the pro-life/pro-gun vote by sowing fear amongst them about #2A (falsely claiming Biden/Dems will ban guns) and abortion (while allowing 1,500 people a day to die through inaction and blame)  Fear is their ONLY tool Fear is not leadership
Yeah i watched that,, #foxnews love for #trump is nauseating. They will get anyone on the show to say anything bad about #Biden and praise #Trump.  Fox news is #FakeNews

Theres nothing in the constitution that says that BIDEN could not pick OBAMA for VP
Of course not!   Biden can hardly carry on a conversation with himself.   O'Biden administration was the most secretive in recent history because they had to hide their efforts to sell out America for personal gain and hide Obama's Marxist agenda.   #ObamaBidenGate
I have not seen any Biden bumper stickers either.  Perhaps Biden is waiting until he declares a VP running mate. My choice is a Biden/Bass (100% Communist, Defund the Police) ticket.  Prepare for a RED tidal wave in Nov.
If all the Democrat Vice Presidential candidates are women, is Biden sexist? If top candidates are all Black, is Biden racist? Should the most qualified person be selected? MartinLutherKingJr said, "not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character".
I bet Biden is the redacted name....
Lol trump hasn‚Äôt done much to embarrass himself and that‚Äôs not even the issue BIDEN IS A POLITICAL CRIMINAL that‚Äôs the issue here
I'm not at all excited for  but I eagerly await the respite of boring, mediocre competency that we can all start ignoring again.   Biden is not our savior, but he's our best chance to return to some kind of normalcy,  take a breather and all calm the hell down.
Fox hosts previously dismissed the idea that Trump would delay the election  via  Just watch  bunch of the Fox News anchors laugh at Joe Biden for saying that Trump is going to try and push back the election.
No, he got impeached because the Liberals are panicking. He is exposing their corruption. What we SAW and HEARD Biden do was actual ‚Äúdirty game‚Äù. But, you see what you want to see - meaning you too are corrupt. There you go.

Like of course China and Iran would prefer Biden. Virtually every country if pressed would certainly say they prefer one or the other. Interference is possible, like in last election, but that interference last election was "This Facebook event was made by some Russians." We've
I mean it's not that Russia, China, and Iran are secretly manipulating things so Trump and Biden face off (no matter how many big-brained Dems claim otherwise), just that out of those two they have their preferences. This is not as big a story as some think it is IMO.
Presuming the Lincoln Project is rational, both of these sentences are lies. Biden believes in abortion. *Devout* Catholics do not. Trump has never gassed peaceful Americans.
The October Surprise for the Biden campaign will be his VP pick.
Kanye has graduated from a piece of shit to a MASSIVE piece of shit

Biden has access to God and he will heal America.  Joe, do not upset God by dating Karen Mc Dougal or Stormy Daniels, okay! ... and do not open up an investigation about Epstein suicide file either!  It is what it is!
Trump is still using taxpayers money to subsidize his political campaign while denying an extension to 45,000,000 of Americans their unemployment benefits.  Trump had a vision that Biden will upset God by having an affair with Karen Mc Dougal and Stormy Daniels.

There is no "i"in trump. There is much more integrity, genuine caring, &amp; there is an "i" in BIDEN.
OHIO, U care more about principles THAN even money. Don't you deserve a morally selfless PRESIDENT? A PRESIDENT who will respect ur individual FREEDOMS &amp; UR ECONOMIC prosperity? There is NO "I" in trump. He talks about himself, tweets about himself, etc. There is an "i" in BIDEN.

The depressing thing is if Biden wins he will be taking over just as the worst economic impacts of Covid hit us. This will play 2 the super unimaginative nature of his  corporate Democrat wing and we will get austerity. All progressive policy proposals will b declared impossible.
During the debates there were many tRump supporters who registered Democrat and signed on as Berners try and get him as the nominee. They felt he was the weak link. I like Bernie's platform and ideas. Biden has a father figure demeanor I think. Either way there is division.

Based on polling right now, Solid and lean toward votes give Trump 170, Biden 268. Battle-ground states total 100 more votes. Meaning Trump must win every single one of those votes to get to 270 and be re-elected. Biden needs to win just 2. But 3 months is eternity.
I agree.  How much do you miss a President like Barak Obama?  How much did we do to silence the Birthers and Obamacare Death Pannels conspirazy theory?  We left President Obama alone and he and Joe Biden were bullied by Hannity, Limbaugh, Trump, Mc Connell, and Alex Jones.
They don‚Äôt want Biden to debate Trump, as Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence. Dude has no chance of becoming president
Then, as Joe Biden would put it, you ain't queer.
They‚Äôll never give Trump the opportunity to call Biden a coward and afraid to debate. Can you imagine an enraged Biden slipping in and out of lucid thought while attempting to defend his courage.

Biden and the DNC are trying to manipulate the whole race on the other hand.  You don't have an issue with that?

This convinces me that you know NOTHING about what‚Äôs at stake in Nov. You think liberals have your best interests at heart? Progressives, so called, are nothing but communists who don‚Äôt have the guts to come out of the closet. Joe Biden is unfit to serve that will be clear soon.Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.

At the airport, in the past month...0 Biden logos, at least 10-15 Trump each day.
And I would vote for a potted plant before voting for Joe Biden. üéçüåæ
All Biden has to do is let your old man keep talking.
Well I donated $1000 to Joe Biden.
Don, your comment sounds like it came from Joe Biden. The Pebble project poses no harm to Bristol Bay. China would love us to shut down mining in America!
Biden will win Florida.
Biden vs Trump 2020. The dementia Olympics. Who will win the gold medal!?
I‚Äôve seen so many people saying they‚Äôll vote for Biden based only on the fact that he‚Äôs not trump it‚Äôs insane.
honestly...it seems like he's trying to fuck biden up. whoever this endorsement was supposed to draw in to support Biden, the backlash from the right will be disproportionate
I vote for total humiliation of Trump.  Just wish I was more confident Joe Biden is the man for that job.
And it's not like there is anyway Biden will win over Trump. Even if he magically gets the popular vote, the electoral college will likely prop up Trump again. The DNC doesn't care if Biden gets elected or not.
I'm not gonna fucking vote for Biden either. I have a tough time that shit will matter soon.
I will crawl through the Sahara Desert without a drop of water or walk through a snake filled swamp to vote for Biden!
And btw, Trump signed into law a bi-partisan bill that reversed some of the worst parts of the Biden bill.
That's why everyone is going to vote for Biden
Maybe Biden's slogan should be Make America Great Again.
LCD? Yeah, I hated when he said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Oh, wait, that quote was from Biden, who wrote the law that increased black incarceration  2 1/2 times and did nothing to reduce black incarceration as VP to a black president
Biden has literally promised that nothing will change.  We are pretty much screwed.
If we can swallow Biden as the nominee, we might as well accept anybody he picks for VP and cabinet members.  But really, no Medicare for All?  Seriously?  In a pandemic?
This Republican is voting for Biden! #YesWeCanAgain
She seems to be even further left than Biden, so that affects my choice.
OK, who knew that Biden grew up in the same town as The Office?
What keeps me up at night? Joe Biden‚Äôs name appearing in an Epstein document a few weeks before the election. I really don‚Äôt want Trump to win, and don‚Äôt think he will, but we‚Äôve got to adopt a better way of choosing our overlords than who (of 2) separated fewer kids from parents
And vote for Joe Biden
What could possibly go wrong there?  Is Biden that intent on telling progressives to go away and get lost?
Biden head shake is a gift and we will tell you Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Clinton was more competent but was viewed in a negative light by more people. Conservatives don‚Äôt view Biden as much of a threat.
Didn't James and his wife donate 1.3 million to Biden camp?
It always shows "this tweet is unavailable." Did Joe Biden block you????
Why did you stop the audio.  Had you continued: Stern: Did you want to bang her? Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôve never been into that. They‚Äôve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category. There's more but out of words...
The election between Hillary and Trump and Biden and Trump is one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen.
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
Hard to blame him. It‚Äôs hard to be motivated to go out &amp; vote when voting is what got us Trump vs Hillary in 2016. &amp; Trump vs Biden 2020. Of course voting is important, I don‚Äôt disagree with that. But I don‚Äôt blame anyone one bit for not being motivated to vote for politicians.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
Sounds like  owes Joe Biden an apology.
Trump better have his bags packed by Inauguration Day.   Biden‚Äôs White House doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúextended checkout time‚Äù
Biden would have been a 90‚Äôs Republican
Joe Biden needs to go and announce his VIP pick so we can vote for her already
Biden ought to commit to establishing a task force to energetically undo every one of Trump's executive actions that can be reversed.
Let a Trump run your company, but I‚Äôll vote Biden to run the country.
Still not going to vote for Biden.
And I'll unmute others when they stop trying to convince me that Joe Biden is the savior.   BTW, our tomato plants are fucking amazing.So basically you‚Äôre saying #Biden will build our economy, help low income families, &amp; send energy, construction, &amp; companies souring.   has increased government overreach through the #AffordableEnergyRule  #TrumpLiesAllTheTime #WeAreExhausted
Biden was at the Royals game!!
I hate that Biden felt like he needed to apologize. I wish the right didn‚Äôt use faux outrage like the left does. Biden‚Äôs comments were harmless. He shouldn‚Äôt need to apologize.
Sounds like he‚Äôs going the way if Biden. #Dementia
The only reason Biden wins is because enough people are sick of Trump. No one, let me repeat, no one is voting for Biden because they like him or want him to be President. They simply don't want Trump.
He has much higher than a zero percent chance. I won't vote for him, but I also won't vote for Biden
Nope. Dems aren't smart enough. They put all their best blood up in the primaries. And they've all been doubling down on Biden ever since. Trust me. They don't have a knight in shining white armor.
It‚Äôs perfectly safe to question trumps ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. If someone says ‚Äútwo Corinthians‚Äù or Joe Biden will hurt god and hurt the bible the guy has no idea what any of it means he‚Äôs just regurgitating words
Fake news ... again.  Clinton didn‚Äôt take em, Obama didn‚Äôt take em, Biden isn‚Äôt going to take em. You just keep ‚Äúsaying stuff‚Äù but it has no bearing on reality
And #Biden is a close friend of her family! But her hubby is a Federalist soooo she probably has to see what he advises. Gotta look after herself don‚Äôt ya know.
Biden has been racist for several decades. This isn't a revelation.
Not many Biden voters is there?
Biden: globe? I thought we were on the planet earth.
#Trump is lying about #SallyYates, #Obama, #Biden &amp; #Flynn. #TrumpHasNoCredibility
Ok slowly now Biden said you‚Äôre not black if you aren‚Äôt voting for me.
This is the best candidate the Dems can get?  In response to question about cognitive tests, Biden asks if his interviewer is on cocaine
Maybe he just realized what the rest of us have known all along. Democrats can‚Äôt cheat enough to help Biden.
Kuz, y‚Äôall can‚Äôt wear Vote Biden during the an NBA game. Huge difference man.
My own questions about Biden's cognitive health were not based on some absolute (he stutters), but on a relative comparison to the past (even 2016). In the same way, in my opinion, Trump's cognitive function has declined markedly over the past 4 years.
Agreed. Fortunately nobody from the Biden or Trump campaigns has invited me to treat either candidate. To be fair, I would have no idea where to begin since I'm not a neurologist, but I'm confident it would be very entertaining. üòÜ
My sources were: First, my own observation that this man appeared to be in steep cognitive decline. Second, asking my neurologist friend if he thought Biden had dimentia and him responding positively in the affirmative. That's all still opinion, of course.
I don't think anyone outside Biden's inner circle actually knows. Outside that, it's speculation and opinion. As for Russian involvement, unless they implanted a microchip in my head without my knowledge, I came up with this theory on my own. üòâ
Is there evidence that Biden has dementia? Reports are that ~40% of voters *believe* that he does, but is there an actual source?
I've seen many Trump supporters claiming Biden is not cognitively well and that they don't trust his mental capacity. How can they feel better about their guy? Neither are strong speakers
Sir, the Postal Union is backing Biden. Mail in voting can't be trusted anywhere.
Where the question was worded as ‚Äúwho should we fill out your mail-in ballot for  ? 1. Biden 2. Joe Biden ‚Äú
Fake news media afraid of letting Dementia Biden debate President Trump.
I‚Äôve never seen one  sign, flag or bumper sticker in real life...ever!  I‚Äôve seen thousands of Trump flags, signs, hats, stickers, shirts...like everything.  Biden is toast!  Or smells toast.  One or the other.
"They‚Äôve become unrevealing quip contests." I'd say "Because you'd be in jail!" was a very revealing quip.
Horrific. The fact that Biden and the rest of the left have so little respect for black lives that they send them out to get Covid in lawless cities is disgusting.
Joe is only there to pick the VP who will then made President.  She would NOT win if she were the candidate! #Trump2020  Dan Bongino: Sources Say Joe Biden Is Reaching the Point of No Return, Democrats Will Have a Decision to Make
Again, y‚Äôall really think Joe Biden will beat Trump in November? Na bruh. Ain‚Äôt happening.
Dude lay off the Biden clips. So confusing.
üñïhere is to Biden
She must be drinking the same shit Biden is......
FBI Investigated Joe Biden‚Äôs Campaign for Corruption! Ultimately, only Christopher Tigani faced charges. He was sentenced to two years in federal prison in March 2012. Worse, it shined a light on the corruption of Delaware politics.  #biden #corruption
Nope that was the Obama Biden Administration!!!
Y‚Äôall really think Joe Biden gonna beat Trump in November? Na
Good news: Biden won't have to worry about anything except his sexual assault litigation after Nov 3.
How could anyone consider voting for someone who can‚Äôt even get onto a debate stage? Kids in high school debate classes would be better than Biden.
I don‚Äôt see how anyone could be excited about Biden or a Democrat platform.
Biden must be headed over to buy something....
I just can‚Äôt stop laughing at all the buffoons with #TDS that are going to vote for Biden anyway. Lol üòÇ  Can you imagine being SO DERANGED that you actually vote for the worst candidate to ever run for political office in any race in history?Do you think making up this list is going to divert the attention of, anybody who has at least a 5th grade education, away from the fact that Joe Biden has dementia? Pop the bubble!
I Agree. Mr Biden is a deeply religious family man. He is a community supporter and a patriotic individual.
üòéüëç I will fight for you either way
I will go where I want.  Voter shaming a leftist-independent is not how you won voters for  or the  A candidate earns my vote through their policy and their character.  is a disgusting, creepy racist whose policy has slowed progress for decades.
I was never going to vote Biden lol  Go phone bank some Republicans, you'll have better luck there.
Joe Biden has the Democratic Party behind him, a lot of Republicans would vote for a crazy person before they would vote for a Democratic candidate
This whole Kanye thing is dumb. Yes things are taken out of context for obvious reasons, but people close to the trump campaign are doing everything possible to split votes to have Biden lose out on votes. Does that not make sense to any of you?
Honestly most of the stuff Biden says confuses me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hmm...hurt God? Mister 2 Corinthians?
Instagram also had a "glitch" where negative Trump posts wouldn't show up in Trump hashtag searches but negative Biden hashtags produced negative Biden posts.
Ya imagine if it was Biden in that interview it‚Äôd be 10x worse I‚Äôll take what we have now. Thanks thoüôèüèΩ
100% agree! I dislike Trump &amp; Biden. I really need to see a debate so I can decide which one is less of an idiot.
And a majority of those democrats still realize that Joe Biden‚Äôs healthcare policy will get the closest to what those 87% support than anyone ever has. Voting for the other guy means you won‚Äôt get it, because the conservative-packed courts will overturn it if it ever gets passed.
It‚Äôs official America has 2 unstable men teaming up to run against Biden! Yup!!! Its going to take more than 2 unstable cables (Trump and Kanye) to play dirty tricks to win. Roll your sleeves boys it ain‚Äôt going to be easy sleezies
OMG. This is Biden's "Harry and Louise" ad. Let's hope it's just as effective.
LMAO disaster? You'll see the real deal if Biden is elected! How will the stock market respond to increased taxes and regulations....answer that dummy
I know its going to tighten up, because right leaning people are gonna hold their nose and vote for Trump.  But Biden would have to really screw up to lose.
Say what you will about Trump (and I do, I‚Äôd never vote for him), but the cool thing about this is that Biden will sleep through it all too!
If Biden has really lost 9 points in the last month ( unlikely), these next 3 months are going to be unbearable
Thanks. As a Presidential Elector, I was fortunate to have special tickets to the inauguration and was in the seats below the balcony. Here are the swearing in photos of President Obama and Vice President Biden.
Yosemight? üßê I swear when we see him and biden at the debates, its gonna look like two old drunk guys slurring and at each other. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I dislike Trump, but he would DESTROY Biden in a debate.
And Joe Biden is a genius üôÑ
Congrats, you are literally the FIRST person to make a point about Biden's policy, instead of just railing about Trump. Or how left independents are ruining a party they aren't even registered to ü§£ you win!
I got email, I thought from your campaign to ask for input, I included some creative ideas and donated money and the send button did not work. Hmm. (Russians?) is it true Biden's and your campaign money collected is down.
You realize the  and  work in concert, right? Biden is just another puppet of the oligarchy.
This is quite the exaggeration. Biden is a right-wing Trojan-Horse. He is arguably the farthest right in the Democratic Party. We all know the  is just the other head of the right-wing oligarchy. If you haven't figured it out by now, I know of 103 fascist billionaire donors
I already know the Obama/Biden admin and their goons DID!
What makes you think Biden and his administration won't abuse that power? Rmember Standing Rock? Who was the Pres. and VP then?
What makes you think Biden and his administration won't abuse that power? Rmember Standing Rock? Who was the Pres. and VP then?
I am not underestimating Trump. Why are you underestimating Biden's right-wing tendencies while exaggerating his progressivism?
It's pretty stupid to ignore the very real possibility Biden will still allow fascism to further take root.
1- not really. Biden has already threatened protesters and "violent anarchists," same language as Trump, and promised nothing will change. 2- 1994 Crime Bill. New Jim Crow. Mass Incarceration. 3- *MIGHT* Biden hasn't come out against the expanded powers he and Obama gave DHS

Do you realize how desperate you sound?? You can't stand the fact that Biden is so far ahead of you that younare dust in the wind....Bye Don.
Have you heard it‚Äôs Biden you‚Äôre up against! Not Obama.
Cute, but no.  Biden‚Äôs not even the real candidate.  Trump 2020.
Are we being gaslit in 2020? Donald Trump in US election polls surge as voters trust him to revive COVID-19 hit economy
Biden can‚Äôt remember what science is.
After you have destroyed everything in America,  it's going to take time to Make our Nation great again. Biden will have a lot on his plate to fix the disaster you left. BIDEN 2020
Sadly, he is running again..Biden is a puppet and it‚Äôs been said he is the puppet of AOC and the Dismantle America Squad BUT.. I am convince BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA has just revealed himself as the Democratic PUPPETMASTER!!!

Joe Biden is a good man and a great American. I don't care if he is surrounded by all of the best Dems who do the heavy lifting and prop him up for 4 years. The sinister POS in the WH now is evil and has done irreparable damage to our country
Could Turley be any more of a hack at this point.  Biden: trump may try to delay the election.  Trump: says it my be time to delay the election.  Turley: they‚Äôre both equally nuts!
I think about this a lot. I think about all the shit we could have pushed just end up with Biden after trump wrecked the country.
How can it be a vote for Trump when the Right says it is a vote for Biden?  Or maybe nobody owns your damn vote but you, and it goes directly and ONLY to who you vote for.  This faulty logic is why we continue to have a two-party duopoly working in kahoots for their donors

The good thing about Biden is that when he makes a mistake, it‚Äôs inadvertent &amp; he‚Äôll correct it. When Trump makes a mistake 160,000 people are dead &amp; the Department of Homeland Security is dragging Americans away in unmarked vans.
Hey!  ! If you‚Äôre going to play a clip of trump attacking  , do a little more than say that Biden fired back in a statement, without enough of the statement to be helpful.
What you mean like Biden saying they're not black if they don't vote for him?
Such a large divide between the progressive left who rallied behind bernie and the straight establishment that forced biden as the candidate from the primaries, obv trump will be the GOP candidate but does the party mostly agree?
Umm twitter guys for Biden -  stfu you‚Äôre boring
Last bastion for patriarchal ideology. It shames Utah to back such a monster. I can't believe there are that many stupidly blind Utahns still willing to support this horrible creature. Get a clue Utah Donald Trump holding on to lead over Joe Biden in Utah
Our beloved, gaffe-prone VP strikes again. This happens when he tries very hard to include as many people as he can in his embrace. He loves Americans no matter what race.  Biden tries to clarify remarks suggesting lack of diversity in the Black community
If Biden is elected the Obama coup will disappear!!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
With Hillary they laid a foundation with Benghazi and the server a year before. The October surprise was Weiner and Comey.   What‚Äôs Trump got for a surprise? Another report on the origins of the Mueller report? If so, what‚Äôs that got to do with Biden?
Yes they sure do! ‚ù§Ô∏è Have a beautiful day everyone!üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
You can‚Äôt be voting for Biden based on policy . right now is the wrong time to let some personal shit get in the way of politics üíØ #CountryOverParty #KeepAmericaGreat
Isn't it odd how Donald can't complete a single thought on TV but when it comes to Twitter he miraculously is the same way?  I‚Äôm not worried about Joe Biden‚Äôs mental capacity. I am however horrified by Donald Trumps obvious lack of mental capacity and aptitude.
What we really needed was Bernie. Needed him 4 years ago, needed him now, but the DNC fucked him in the ass once again, and gave us an establishment puppet. Biden is the status quo for the establishment. Still not as bad as the GOP
I‚Äôm just pointing out why Sanders lost. It wasn‚Äôt any conspiracy, it‚Äôs just simply that not enough of his supporters voted for him. Primary turnout was horrible all around, and I‚Äôm disappointed more didn‚Äôt show up. We do need to get behind Biden, Trump needs to be stopped, now.
Biden picking Susan Rice would be the stupidest thing he's done in his 77 years of existence. I'd rather defend Kamalas record of truancy prosecution than Benghazi and Libya attacks
I love all the incredible, passionate strong capable women Biden is considering for VP. But this here is exactly why she should be his partner in governing. This woman doesn't play around &amp; she's got no time for foolishness. She's exactly what we need right now &amp; 2024 for Pres.
Ooh. Be careful. Biden #hurtgod. WTF?
Wait!!  Did Joe Robgan switch sides??? Is he voting for Biden now??
Vote alphabetically. Biden wins. You‚Äôre welcome. üòÉ
They gave people several choices in primaries, the people voted, and not enough of them. Turnout was terrible, and we got Biden because of it. If more people who tweeted and Facebooked about Sanders all day actually voted, he‚Äôd have won. They didn‚Äôt vote, the numbers don‚Äôt lie.
I‚Äôm wondering how Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù  #TrumpIsNotWell
The news cycle today was supposed to be  focused on Biden's statement on Hispanics and black Americans which honestly isn't that big a deal. Instead we're talking about how Biden will hurt God lol
Biden is a devote Catholic.
But is Biden against baseball, apple pie &amp; ice cold lemonade? #TrumpIsNotWell
One of Biden‚Äôs potential running mates is Tammy Duckworth.  If we ever have a President Duckworth it will be the first President to have a name from Ducktales since President Mallard Fillmore. ü¶Ü
And I‚Äôm different!! Ah to be Latino in A Biden world!! GTFOH you racist puppet!! His tweet staff couldn‚Äôt avoid this one lol!!
I would love it if Biden just decides he isn't going to do any debates. We can just check results of the last 3 and one half years to see what we don't need. Big on talk...bad on results.
IMPORTANT: My scientific *cough* predictions for Joe Biden's VP pick:  Susan Rice, with Tammy Duckworth being a close follow up.  Source: Wikipedia Last Edit time for their respective pages.
Will this bastard ever tell the truth? This is the monster who hurt protestors in order to have a photo op in front of a church, holding a bible upsidedown. He's sweating bullets because he's desperate.  Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible, hurt God,' guns
Trump is close to accusing Biden of being against water
This is why I have no problem with Biden asking that journalist if he's on crack for asking stupid questions
This is why Biden accuses these journalist of being on crack
Joe Biden does not need anyone's help to kill the gods.
"For the first time, the gods knew fear. They tried to flee, but it was too late. Joe Biden's heart destroyed the gods who created him and turned the heavens to ashes. To this very day, no one can oppose the beating of Joe Biden's heart."
"With fire and steel did the gods forge Biden's heart. So fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, 'On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the heavens. None can stand before it without trembling at its strength.'"
Most large groups and businesses are corrupt...lol... nothing new here unless someone is going to do something about it. Not holding my breath on that one. Corruption is running rampant in the GOP and all their buddies' big businesses. Vote for Biden!

Oh, and a Biden administration would throw a fit over RBG's replacement (or one of the others) ruling against their political agenda as well. I totally get that.   Maybe if both sides got better at writing laws/orders......
Trump wouldn‚Äôt know or mispronounce it and Biden would go on a tangent and ultimately ask if you‚Äôre a junkie

Kim, I‚Äôm begging you to encourage Kanye to remove himself from presidential consideration. Trump associates are trying to use Kanye to split the Biden vote. Kim, please, we can‚Äôt endure 4 more yrs of Trump. Please help us stop him.
So you do realize with how weak a candidate and unstable Biden is, a vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump really. Same thing happened in 2016...
Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
I'll go even further. Trump is actually right on alot of things. So is Biden. It's the "how" that makes all the difference. Truth is truth like a vaccine is a vaccine and a virus is a virus. Data is data and science is science. It's what Trump does with the data is the problem.
Are you even aware that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are two different people?
Joe Biden is considering Susan Rice for his VP--which pretty much means the DNC is considering Susan Rice for President. This criminal corruptocrat must never be allowed w/in breathing distance of the White House ever again.
America must re- elect president Trump. If not the Obama gate  and Biden gate will disappear, we must uphold the constitution
Woohoo! This guy validates my own prediction!! You will be OUSTED! It can't happen soon enough for America! Get the f**k out of DC and don't come back! Biden will beat Trump, says historian who predicted every presidential race since 1984
Getting really tired of the misogynistic attitudes of politics. Biden has surrounded himself with men who don't like women advancing themselves. Men can do it, but women? Oh, no, women are insulted and held back. Don't listen to them Joe, listen to your wife! She's your best bet!
Get rid of Dodd and all the other sexist idiots who hate women. If you don't believe that, look another look at what they are doing/saying. Use your own judgement and pick the best woman. Sexism casts shadow over Biden's search for a female running mate
Biden is a terrible candidate, but yes, what's the ham sandwiches policy on climate change and fighting global pedo rings
Our major systemic corruption and dehumanization of BIPOC makes it even harder to grapple voting for Biden. He doesn‚Äôt care about these children. His administration set the precedent for these human rights violations. We need a better option #fuckthednc
Sally Yates is everything your not. Honest, credible &amp; patriotic. You‚Äôre yesterday‚Äôs news, Don. Have you started packing yet? President Biden has real work to do. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Utah is hot as hell too!! Our ski season had started late and ended early for the last 3-4 years !!
It takes a real political genius to tell Biden he needs to suck up to unreliable fringe elements right now. But it's good work if you can get it.
Biden is leading by 8-10. He doesn't need to beg for help from anyone. And he has that lead in large part because he is in fact seen by much of the electorate as a moderate who gives wedgies to both the Bernie dead-enders and the Trump apologists.
#ItIsWhatItIs is inhuman  #ItIsWhatItIs is ice cold  #ItIsWhatItIs is sociopathic  Trump must be voted out. We deserve empathy. We deserve a national plan. We will get both with Biden. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Factions on both the left and right with negative leverage trying to extort concessions from Biden in exchange for a tiny number of votes they will never give is quite the spectacle.
Na,  is correct. Biden IS NOT progressive, he's a fake and a liar, and a Democrat in the center to center-right
Now do Biden and his 872 stumbles and bumbles on camera. Oh yeah, he‚Äôs a dem so he‚Äôs flawless.
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip   this shit is so fucking scary..
Noticing an interesting trend in bots both here and on my FB TL that they're not just attempting to sway moderates in support of Trump, but now also looking to sway progressives away from voting for Biden.
Will  #JoeBiden  Actually #Debate #DonaldTrump  ? Let's get this straight the #MSM #MainstreamMedia are TERRIFIED about having Joe Biden out in public and confronting him in debate! They CAN'T have him showing his "Mental" issues!
Terrible what happened, but Zane would be alive today if he wasn‚Äôt out committing armed robbery and running from police. Most people get it. Defunding the police, the military and ICE, all the institutions that protect us is not the answer. Joe Biden is a mess mentally. Yes MAGA.
Fox news is running with the "Biden is scared to debate" storyline provided by a former Bill Clinton staffer nowhere near the Biden campaign. Amazing
Another election where Black Americans have to pray White voters make the right decision. Black people nominated Biden, calculating that surely an old white man would be more palatable to white voters because black lives are dependent on the decision they make in the voting booth
The only people who think Biden can't debate Trump seem to be highly selective non-U.S. Trumpers and a few Bernie dead-enders.
The health of America hinges on a Biden win. Trump is hideously unfit.
I may have to repeat myself: even if Biden picked me, a working time machine, a necromancer, Jesus Christ, the demon Lilith, Scoony-Doo or the man himself, Bernie freakin' Sanders, I will still vote Green.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man, whereas Trump‚Äôs the worst president of my lifetime. Thanks.
Biden eyes major foreign policy shifts if he¬†wins
Cutting financially desperate Americans off at the knees during a pandemic is unconscionable. Trump blew up the national debt with tax breaks for the ultra rich. Now he needs to step up for the little guy.The Senate needs to pass the Heroes Act. Pres. Biden will sort out the rest
What is the "progressive wing" going to do once they "consolidate" behind Biden? Take him from a 10-point win to an 11-point win?

what is Biden offering? NO Police NO Businesses NO freedom of Religion NO Freedom of speech etc LOL
Or better yet...  ! She‚Äôs the ‚ÄúBernie‚Äù that Biden desperately needs, IMO.
Nope, that's your daddy. By the time Biden gets in office, there won't be any kids left..........
anyone else have zero faith in biden or democrats to actually protect election safety and results? you think biden would challenge the results? if you do, you weren't alive in 1999
I didn't vote for anybody. Kinda feels the same way with Biden, but WTF I can't let one of the worst people stay president. I will vote for Biden, but not because I like him, support him but because my arm is being twisted. This is not a viable long term solution for the country.
Just because wall street is doing well doesn't mean main street is. You've mishandled the virus and tanked the economy and Biden is the only hope we have right now.
As you know, #BenedictDonald isn't going to say anything about it on day 39, 40 nor on the day Biden is inaugurated.   Such is life in America while this serial traitor is stinking up the Oval Office. #DonTheConRussianPawn!
This is a bad idea. Whoever is advising Biden to do this is an idiot. Democrats keep thinking Texas can be flipped. It can't! If Beto couldn't beat Ted Cruz, Biden can't beat Trump here. Focus on Arizona and NC.
No matter what u feel... Trump is loosing with landslide margin. He is a psychopath... Go biden go
Wow. Someone needs a reality check. Have we all been seeing the same guy named Biden?

Jan 3. we‚Äôll have a new Congress. More of an anti-Trump than a clear direction for change majority.  A lot of Biden vs the Dem left wing will try to spell out the new direction for the country.  Jan 20-inauguration!  There will be new pain, but ding ding the witch will be dead!

Bernie isn‚Äôt on the ballot. They will vote for Biden. So, Biden voters burn down federal courthouses where religious freedoms are protected. Most Biden voters are atheists. The DN is naive to suggest Biden has anything to offer real religious voters.
Biden voters burn bibles, burn the flag, tear down statues of religious leaders, use funeral ulogies to divide and denigrate the country and demand late term abortion. Biden has nothing to offer true religious voters.
Have they not looked at Biden? He literally does the same thing. Maybe a slightly less orange shade of spray tan
The Trump campaign are pulling ads because they are waiting for his VP pick. Their reelection case will be a referendum on this VP Pick. Attacks against Biden have failed but attacks against his VP could be lethal especially with their strategy to paint him as a Trojan horse.
So Biden is a sexist now?
I dont get the Kamala Harris hype. I just don't.Her supporters block me for a little criticism instead of defending her record.quick to call me a sexist. Lame. She was a horrible candidate, would have lost California in the primaries. What would she offer Biden outside of optics?
Kamala tried to paint Biden as a racist &amp; printed "I was that girl  T shirts", Bass praised Scientologists &amp; the Castro Regime,Susan Rice went on all the Sunday shows&amp;lied about Benghazi. Its amazing how much harm all these possible VP pick did to their chances of being VP
Kamala Harris dropped out before a single vote was cast, her campaign was a mess, her attack on Biden fell flat, turns out she agreed with his bussing policy, black voters in Virgina &amp; South Carolina didn't like her. She would've lost California. What's so impressive about her ?
If Kamala had stayed in the race, she would have lost California to Bernie. A Democrat from California that can't win the California primaries will help Biden win Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida,  North Carolina and Arizona?

"Legal challenges" to Duckworth's citizenship would help Biden.
I still doubt that. She's  living the high life now, so why give it up? Even of she took the job, we can still beat her and Biden !

So the Joe Biden has Dementia approach isn't working? Shocker
What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
But you won‚Äôt condemn the violence by the Biden voters in Portland. What is wrong with you Ben?
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
now you're just Dem-splaining, the way you win wars, is no mercy, you send messages, you go on the attack. GOP knows Democrats are weak and ineffective, and they choose a centrist Joe Biden, who's old and not all there. I will vote for him in self defense, but we are not winning
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Romney is an idiot. Moving more troops into Poland and two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea is not helping Russia or China. But pompous Romney says nothing about Biden‚Äôs proposed defunding of the military.

Biden should select Gretchen Whitmer.
Biden selecting Kamala will drive down the black vote. Her record as a prosecutor is too much baggage. So far Trump cannot attack Biden but he can lay in wait to attack his VP and use her negative to bring down Biden's positives. Cant take that risk.Educate yourself, no Latino in their right mind would listen to her weak ass opinions. She's not gathering up anyone to vote for Biden.

Right. Right.  I'm, sure Biden is in jeopardy of losing NY because of people voting for write-in candidates.  (He's going to win NY by 20%+).  Even though I'm going to vote for Biden, you should cut some slack for those people who think both are bad options (because they are)

Fair enough, but you'll continue to be disappointed.  If local authorities had the ability to solve more problems (like the Constitution actually requires), Trump vs Biden wouldn't be the end of the world decision it has been made out to be.
Joe Biden can call Black people ‚ÄúNot Black‚Äù and ‚ÄúCulturally not Diverse‚Äù but is still entitled to their vote?  Please show me again where Trump is racist against Black people...
Biden won't save us from Trump. Everyone else in opposition to Trump will save us from Trump. Even Trump is doing a great job of that by alienating as many people as he possibly can. Sometimes I wonder if he is an agent saboteur working against the GOP.

If you don't think that Biden will sign the Sanders-Bowman act if Pelosi and Schumer get it on his desk, you simply don't understand the Democratic party. It's on US, the voters, progressives in congress, to set the 2020 agenda.  I guarantee he'll sign any progressive leg he can.
Biden wasn't my guy either. I am a Harris-Warren-Biden voter. But he's our guy. So we vote for him. And we work through the legislative process, and we get him the most progressive healthcare bill we can get.
So rather than acknowledging that holding onto the Senate for Biden's full term is more important than any one individual political goal, you can demand that Doug Jones endorse legislation that you couldn't even convince Democratic PRIMARY voters of.

Probably both. Biden would have very good reason to be as careful as possible given the strength of the right-wing media, as well as keeping positive media focus on him: it's better to have people gossiping about Kamala Harris rather than Tara Reade, for one example. (1/2)
Biden has to avoid a real debate at all costs.    His only option is to have the questions in advance and let him pre-record his teleprompted responses.
I think the fact it's a forgone conclusion makes a surprise pick all the more possible. Maybe not likely but I could see Biden going with Val Demings.

They gave people several choices in primaries, the people voted, and not enough of them. Turnout was terrible, and we got Biden because of it. If more people who tweeted and Facebooked about Sanders all day actually voted, he‚Äôd have won. They didn‚Äôt vote, the numbers don‚Äôt lie.
I will vote for Kanye. Anything but Biden or Trump. I would roll the dice.
he's racist if Trump doesn't get a good 25% or more of the Black vote...otherwise he's sort of a realist...I think Biden is actually speaking for the alzheimer community although there prob aren't that many votes to get from them...their demo caretakers cast their votes for them
Going after Joe Biden‚Äôs faith is a new level of terrible
Joe Biden can‚Äôt pronounce ‚Äúmental fitness‚Äù who are you kidding??????
I still want Biden to take tRUmp out behind the school and give him a good shellacking.
Smart enough to vote for Joe BidenüòÇ what a stupid thing to say
Classier than Donald "I take my steak well done and with ketchup" sure...  But she's riden for biden because it will get her out of the hellhole she's in.
Is it worse then blaming a pandemic on someone like Biden is unsuccessfully trying to do as he stumbles and mumbles through so called speeches.
I bet the first lady is a secret Biden supporter.
Wouldn't it be nice if  just once, he talked about he's going to do instead of trash Biden for what he thinks he won't do?

‚ÄúThese people are too dumb to not vote for Kanye, monkey see monkey do‚Äù  - Biden if the DNC let him speak publicly for more than 10 minutes without promising him his daily CBT
Please don't talk until November and then after. Let your VP run the nation.

The latest Iowa polls released in the last month:   Data for Progress: Trump +2 RMG: Trump +1  David Binder Research: Biden +6 Monmouth: Trump +2  So, even if you conclude David Binder is a partisan poll, that's three in the last couple days showing Trump's lead no more than two.
Honest question: if you think trump and Biden are so close that the VP will make your decision, who‚Äôs WORSE than Pence? I‚Äôm with  Fuuuck you.

I met with a client once who clearly had dementia and was surrounded by roughly 9,000 post-it notes to remind herself of things throughout the day. She had to give power of attorney to sell her home. Joe Biden reminds me of that client. #sadbuttrue

I would love it if Biden just decides he isn't going to do any debates. We can just check results of the last 3 and one half years to see what we don't need. Big on talk...bad on results.
‚ÄúThighland‚Äù. But yes, let‚Äôs talk about Biden‚Äôs cognizance.
Even though the national media is touting the polls showing Joe Biden up, it‚Äôs not looking good for Joe in the critical areas that he needs to win. With his energy policy, there‚Äôs no way in hell that Pennsylvania votes for Joe Biden. Trump is going to carry Florida as well.
fodder* ... And the right doesn't need any fodder. Any person who's watced Joe Biden over the past few months must be concerned about his deterioration. It's to the point now that he literally can't get through a single interview without it being a complete shit show. Unreal
If God doesn‚Äôt care that babies die of cancer, he sure as hell won‚Äôt care if Joe Biden is the next POTUS.

This is stupid, so if Biden doesn't pick who YOU want you are just going to vote for trump? Great...way to phone that in. All in together to make this right and get this traitorous monster out of our damn house, step up and stop being an entitled whiner.
Pres. DJT: ‚ÄúI had such a great life, but that is ok‚Äù....the POTUS left comfortable personal space to be an even greater patriot. The DC MOB is angry, they can no longer completely sellout Americans for their personal gain. More needs to be done. Sliden‚Äô Biden is an empty suit.
Biden will hurt God? As an Irish-Catholic, I'm pretty sure it's the other way around.
‚ÄúAlso, unlike Biden, many of his supporters aren't due to cult of personality.‚Äù  That‚Äôs laughable. Bernie is the center of a cult of personality so strong, only Trump‚Äôs is larger.

Biden's a racist alright, sincerely a Mexican.
My husband saw a Biden bumper sticker on a car just this morning in our SLC neighborhood! It was such a weird sighting he had to comment on it. Before that we'd only seen yard signs for "Dump Trump" and "Any Functional Adult 2020."
Bbbuuut Trump (pointing at Trump and hating Biden criticisms)
This is news to me. How did they conspire? Everything I saw showed a fair primary. Bernie lost, Biden won. But Bernie is still in office, and still has a significant presence in our government.
But you do live in this country, so help make it better. Voting for Biden, even with his flaws, is a step in the right direction. He will bring a competent cabinet with him, and restore our place in the world.
We knew Biden was going to gaffe and this gaffe is so . . . . terrible and ugh.

First, eliminate all Blacks that aren't voting for him (they ain't Black enough). All the rest with "wrongthink" are the "notable exceptions"   Keep asking questions like this, and Biden will eventually revoke your "Black" card.
IS THIS STILL OK WITH BLACKS?  Biden Says the Latino Community Is Incredibly Diverse, 'Unlike the African-American Community'
That's not true at all. The "Democrat victory plan" image you posted is ridiculous and deceitful. Don't try and paint me as some die-hard democrat conspirator, Biden is a shitty candidate but he is still light years better than Trump. What are your reasons for supporting Trump?
No chance that a white cis female will be Biden's VP and his replacement.  I do agree Warren would be much more competent than Biden who is in rapid cognitive decline.    The DNC stole the nomination from Bernie twice now.
They DO always change the subject. Dont they? This has zero to do with Biden, but since you mentioned it NO he doesn't want us to be Cuba. He wants us to be a safe, free, compassionate USA that isnt an embarrassment to the rest of the world.
a) Biden has always had gaffes b) we literally don‚Äôt care
I don‚Äôt need to see you embarrass yourself in a debate to know I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Most large groups and businesses are corrupt...lol... nothing new here unless someone is going to do something about it. Not holding my breath on that one. Corruption is running rampant in the GOP and all their buddies' big businesses. Vote for Biden!

I'm really happy the NY AG is taking this step but it's terrible timing, this will just fire up the GOP and Forever Trumpers to mobilize against Biden even more so,
Is Trump's narrative taking hold, though?  I don't see the whole "Biden hiding in the basement" gaining any traction outside of the right-wing media sphere.
Democrats platform according to Joe Biden is to RAISE YOUR taxes, thus taking money out of your pocket.
I know the feeling, I think it will be Kamala Harris, Rice is to closely associated with Obama and Biden's former administration,
more Black Lives Matter signs. Only a couple of Biden, I‚Äôm in Salt Lake City.
I expect Biden to pardon them if he has the chance.
Where did you see that? All the reports I can find about the Dem Convention say it will include pre-recorded segments and live broadcasts, but don‚Äôt say Biden will be pre-recorded. And the press release implies he‚Äôll be speaking live from Delaware.

We don‚Äôt need a debate to decide your character. You‚Äôve shown us exactly who you are over the past few years. That said, I‚Äôd love to watch Biden hand you your ass in a debate! #DumpTrump
I get why Biden might not want to travel to Wisconsin. But delivering a "pre-recorded" speech?  Uh, that's not COVID-related. That just pushes Trump's narrative.  #utpol

Also, 35-49 favor Trump by 7% while every other demographic favors Biden. That‚Äôs a pretty big shift.
Biden has agreed to 3 debates. It's quite likely they're setting this up as a way to get him to refuse so they can then say the debates are off because Biden wouldn't agree. They've been lying to their supporters Biden wouldn't debate but this may be an out for them.

Biden likes to sniff females and cornpop was male? Just a guess. Dementia is always difficult to ascertain.
He does not inspire confidence.  I see someone who is past their prime, and I will be there too soon enough.    I understand how someone can hate Trump, but what do they see in Biden.  They might as well put his running mate at the top of the ticket.  RICE - biden 2020

He makes no sense haha zero credibility but ask her about the leaked conversation and oh Obama Biden new? He's a Q tip  ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

DEMS have no talking points! They're failed washed up ambulance chasers collecting their gov't welfare checks! Biden gives away $Billions of taxpayers dollars to bribe his Ukrainian friends &amp; Beijing Joe fraudsters!  DEMS screwed American's &amp; the LOW IQ voters r clueless!
Yes Biden is a old dementia man that can‚Äôt think on his feet  you want that for president
I‚Äôm withholding til Biden drops his VP pick
Sir, the Postal Union is backing Biden. Mail in voting can't be trusted anywhere.
The depressing thing is if Biden wins he will be taking over just as the worst economic impacts of Covid hit us. This will play 2 the super unimaginative nature of his  corporate Democrat wing and we will get austerity. All progressive policy proposals will b declared impossible.
During the debates there were many tRump supporters who registered Democrat and signed on as Berners try and get him as the nominee. They felt he was the weak link. I like Bernie's platform and ideas. Biden has a father figure demeanor I think. Either way there is division.

Horrific. The fact that Biden and the rest of the left have so little respect for black lives that they send them out to get Covid in lawless cities is disgusting.
Did he convince you to vote Biden?
I would vote Biden
Soon Liberals taking over ha ha!! And we can use Trump‚Äôs examples executive orders you conservatives supported to do stuff on guns and right wing hate groups too. Biden gonna love the new powers President Trump established.
Based on polling right now, Solid and lean toward votes give Trump 170, Biden 268. Battle-ground states total 100 more votes. Meaning Trump must win every single one of those votes to get to 270 and be re-elected. Biden needs to win just 2. But 3 months is eternity.
I agree.  How much do you miss a President like Barak Obama?  How much did we do to silence the Birthers and Obamacare Death Pannels conspirazy theory?  We left President Obama alone and he and Joe Biden were bullied by Hannity, Limbaugh, Trump, Mc Connell, and Alex Jones.
They don‚Äôt want Biden to debate Trump, as Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence. Dude has no chance of becoming president
Then, as Joe Biden would put it, you ain't queer.
They‚Äôll never give Trump the opportunity to call Biden a coward and afraid to debate. Can you imagine an enraged Biden slipping in and out of lucid thought while attempting to defend his courage.
It‚Äôs more about anti trump than pro Biden so I doubt it matters at all
fake news is starting to really show their hand now. what's next during a presidential debate baby Biden will be in a plastic bubble. With the oxygen tent nearby. And maybe you some milk and cookies. Q said all assets l deployed.

Biden‚Äôs best shot at the most powerful position in the world involves being barricaded in a basement for nine months, dodging the presidential debates and avoiding any media interviews that require coherent responses. Would be crazy if it worked.
Now is NOT THE TIME to split the Dem Party. A vote 4 anyone but Biden is a vote 4 tRump.
Yes. Biden wants to steal the presidency.
If you support Joe Biden for president I will not vote 4U in the next election. #JoeBiden has been a liar for 40 years. Look it up for yourself. He lied about his college experience, his past and he was a co- conspirator with #BaracObama to ruin America. #Trump2020

Gonna have very mixed feelings when Biden/Harris surprisingly lose in November.
And they will vote for Joe Biden.  Every American who turned 18 years old since 2016 and witnessed their student loans balloon into a huge amount or work for minimum wage while the Trumps stole $160,000,000 of taxpayers money, will vote for Biden ... no doubt about that!
Biden means HOPE.
We are voting for Joe Biden no matter what happens from today to November 3 2020.  While the Trump‚Äôs rewarded themselves with millions of taxpayers money, TODAY there are 45,000,000 unemployed Americans who will not get a $600 unemployment benefit.

Vote for Biden.

Probably will be once Biden gets in office
There is a basement. It's Joe Biden's basement.
Notre dame backed out so who knows if someone else will pick it up. But biden is trying very hard to get them canceled. I don't blame him. I didnt vote for cox and am not a fan of him lately so I agree with you.
YEP and by canceling debates and by hiding Biden from the world not letting him talk. It's all being manipulated big time
Biden and the DNC are trying to manipulate the whole race on the other hand.  You don't have an issue with that?
"Biden...said, ‚ÄúMark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, and come up with some rationale why it cannot be held.‚Äù It is just the type of thing that a crazed guy in a tightly buttoned raincoat whispers to you on the subway." -
Even after the election if Biden wins he wont take office till January 20th, I'm sure it apples there aswell.
Not much good news for tRump.  Biden vs. Trump 2020: Live Updates

I don't c how picking Kamala H offers a real opportunity to expand the base of people who are excited or motivated to vote for Biden. She has little to no support on the left (as opposed to the liberals) and not a fit to the center-right. The only value added seems to be for ...
This convinces me that you know NOTHING about what‚Äôs at stake in Nov. You think liberals have your best interests at heart? Progressives, so called, are nothing but communists who don‚Äôt have the guts to come out of the closet. Joe Biden is unfit to serve that will be clear soon.Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.

Why is Joe Biden allowed to go to the games?
Just read his clarification on what he really meant.  Is it just me or did he just reiterate his initial statement? Haha reading a Joe Biden quote is way harder than hearing him say it.
Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
If Biden's VP pick is not Kamala, you'll vote for Trump?  That's not a very smart plan.   Just thought you should know.
Does he remember who it is? #Biden
So did you not vote for the green tax incentives that helped his company grow, or did you forget, like Biden

Biden must be a pretty powerful Titan If he has the ability to hurt a god. Zeus blood in those genes????
If he wins the nation as we know it is over, I really believe that. Not because of Biden, but because the far left own Biden. Assuming democrats win that also means they hold the house and win the senate (most likely) green new deal, single payer, abortion at birth it‚Äôs coming
Joe is an expert at the whole ‚Äòsneak up behind you and shamelessly smell you technique‚Äô.  Trumps a bit taller than Biden‚Äôs usual victims though.
I would honestly pay good money to see Joe Biden beat the shit out of god.
Negative. Sweetheart your incorect.   B o.  Biden is Marxist  socialist communist if want a Marxist president he the for love  vote Donald j. Trump he for constitution  nationalism   real freedom that s Donald trump
Haha well that‚Äôs kinda what Joe Biden implied, if you know one you know them all.  So it makes sense he thinks like that. Haha your comment is too good 10/10.

Was it the APWU that endorsed Biden?
Oh I totally get that. I just look at it as who can I vote for and feel good about it. That‚Äôs not Trump or Biden.
So either you‚Äôre ridin‚Äô with Biden or you‚Äôre hitchhiking with MAGA. One is working toward a racist, fascist state and the other is not. The choice is not fair, but it is absolutely clear. /rant
Be honest that you‚Äôre okay with kids in cages and unmarked vans disappearing protestors as long as YOU don‚Äôt have to say you voted for Biden
I realize that ‚ÄúBiden isn‚Äôt a fascist‚Äù is not a great reason to vote for him. That‚Äôs a reallly low bar we‚Äôve set. But he‚Äôs the candidate we have right now. There isn‚Äôt another candidate who has a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell  at taking the White House
Biden has MANY FLAWS. But he is someone we can work with. He is someone who can be pushed further left once he‚Äôs in office (especially if we can hold the house and flip the senate!)
Seriously. I understand Biden is not the leftist candidate many of us wanted. But do you think that another 4 years of T*ump is going to achieve the ends you want? You think T*ump is going to legalize marajuna and give everyone free college tuition?

I'm not even a Trump supporter but if he would've just made that cocaine comment to a black reporter, he'd never hear the end of it.   Face the truth, Biden is a creep and has said plenty of racist things over his career and the last few months.
Happy Birthday President Obama! For your birthday, we will vote in President Biden! #PresidentObama #PresidentBiden

I vote for total humiliation of Trump.  Just wish I was more confident Joe Biden is the man for that job.
And it's not like there is anyway Biden will win over Trump. Even if he magically gets the popular vote, the electoral college will likely prop up Trump again. The DNC doesn't care if Biden gets elected or not.
I'm not gonna fucking vote for Biden either. I have a tough time that shit will matter soon.
I will crawl through the Sahara Desert without a drop of water or walk through a snake filled swamp to vote for Biden!
And btw, Trump signed into law a bi-partisan bill that reversed some of the worst parts of the Biden bill.
LCD? Yeah, I hated when he said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Oh, wait, that quote was from Biden, who wrote the law that increased black incarceration  2 1/2 times and did nothing to reduce black incarceration as VP to a black president
Biden has literally promised that nothing will change.  We are pretty much screwed.
If we can swallow Biden as the nominee, we might as well accept anybody he picks for VP and cabinet members.  But really, no Medicare for All?  Seriously?  In a pandemic?

What could possibly go wrong there?  Is Biden that intent on telling progressives to go away and get lost?
Biden head shake is a gift and we will tell you Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Clinton was more competent but was viewed in a negative light by more people. Conservatives don‚Äôt view Biden as much of a threat.
It always shows "this tweet is unavailable." Did Joe Biden block you????
Why did you stop the audio.  Had you continued: Stern: Did you want to bang her? Trump: Well, at 12, I wasn‚Äôt interested. I‚Äôve never been into that. They‚Äôve sort of always stuck around that 25 (years old) category. There's more but out of words...
Don't worry they will certainly also be shocked and upset when Ex President Trump will comment and attack on president Joe Biden or whoever lead the nation. FOR SURE, right?
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.
Trump better have his bags packed by Inauguration Day.   Biden‚Äôs White House doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúextended checkout time‚Äù

Your an idiot biden! Go back to being Obama's shadow
Joe Biden‚Äôs deep, personal faith helped get him through the tragic deaths of his first wife and daughter (that he‚Äôs dishonestly claimed for decades was due to the other driver being drunk).
This is stupid on so many levels. Navarro helping Biden isn't unconstitutional. Obama helping Biden isn't unconstitutional. Besides, who's pulling the strings? Obama or Bernie and the squad? Because the two groups aren't aligned. Pick one.
I don't know which god Biden worships but I suspect it is the God of Mammon.
Yeah, Trump being an ass about John Lewis not attending his inaugural is the same as Biden saying Hispanics have diversity of thought, unlike blacks.
Ban this!  Biden wants assault weapon plan.  I can do some damage with this!
First, I personally do not believe in God or any kind of religion.  I find it all a con on humanity.  But I do believe Joe Biden and his wife have faith and are much more honest than the orange fool currently disgracing the Oval Office.  My vote is for Joe!
Religion is the deepest rabbit hole of all. Eons of ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù negate our way of life.   Believe as you please.   But PLEASE live for the now. This life matters more than a perceived belief in the next. Not everyone shares your faith.  ‚ÄúBiden will destroy God‚Äù.   #TrumpIsNotWell

I have to stay upbeat and optimistic that Biden is going to win. Otherwise my anxiety and depression are through the roof.
Biden is going to win. We have to register and vote.
I just wondered why they have to troll Biden though? Why not just respond to Trump and his tweets?
Why do all of the MAGAs troll Biden‚Äôs tweets? Jealousy? Envy?

Yeah that‚Äôs baloney.  Biden has never said any of that only weirdos like you
I made it thru 2/3rds of the interview. Kudos to ‚Å¶ for not losing it during this rambling interview. trump should keep doing these interviews. Fodder for Biden, the Lincoln Project, Midas Touch, and ‚Å¶

They are horrible. I donated to Hillary‚Äôs campaign in 2016, and some to Biden‚Äôs. Trump‚Äôs reminds me of the school bully, taking kids lunch money.
Somehow the Trump campaign got my cell phone number? I don‚Äôt know if someone is pranking me, or what? Take a look though at the difference between Biden‚Äôs campaign, and the idiot‚Äôs one. Biden‚Äôs is chill and normal. Trump‚Äôs is aggressive and loud and ridiculous, just like him.
And Biden said "if you don't vote for me, you ain't black" ... but he gets a pass right?
I would also like to know why you are targeting Biden when Trump just gave 685 billion for F-35 in a global pandemic and how many people unemployed and going hungry.  Your priorities are so skewed!  WTH dude????
Seriously fight Biden AFTER Trump is out of the White House!  Not before.  Prioritization is key here

Amazing reading comments on this, especially if you are black and trying to defend Joe Biden. Why not show some love &amp; respect for President Trump who is defending you and addressing Biden for disrespecting the entire black community. Biden is not qualified to run for President.
In this case if you are choosing Biden it means never America.

I'll bite. In what way does Biden not display a reasonable degree of competence, character, and commitment to the Constitution? What's your biggest concern here?
Mueler report showed nothing. Waste of our money. Wanna talk about withholding aid? Joe Biden is caught on camera bragging about that same thing they proved trump innocent of.
Seeing the Democratic Party has done everything they can to take Trump down I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll come up with another plan to rig the election. For instance Biden wanting everyone to mail in their ballot to vote. Trump wants it to be fair as do I!OMG....üòÇü§£üòÇ Geraldo doesn‚Äôt know what the Phuck he‚Äôs spewing! üôÑüôÑüôÑ Joe Biden, will kick Dementia Don‚Äôs butt in a debate!  Hell, I could debate Trump and win by a mile, no problem at all! üíØüëç
I donated to Joe Biden today. I know things are tight, please consider donating, do what you can.  #BlueTsunami
The good thing about Biden is that when he makes a mistake, it‚Äôs inadvertent &amp; he‚Äôll correct it. When Trump makes a mistake 160,000 people are dead &amp; the Department of Homeland Security is dragging Americans away in unmarked vans.
Hey!  ! If you‚Äôre going to play a clip of trump attacking  , do a little more than say that Biden fired back in a statement, without enough of the statement to be helpful.
What you mean like Biden saying they're not black if they don't vote for him?
Such a large divide between the progressive left who rallied behind bernie and the straight establishment that forced biden as the candidate from the primaries, obv trump will be the GOP candidate but does the party mostly agree?
Umm twitter guys for Biden -  stfu you‚Äôre boring
Last bastion for patriarchal ideology. It shames Utah to back such a monster. I can't believe there are that many stupidly blind Utahns still willing to support this horrible creature. Get a clue Utah Donald Trump holding on to lead over Joe Biden in Utah
Our beloved, gaffe-prone VP strikes again. This happens when he tries very hard to include as many people as he can in his embrace. He loves Americans no matter what race.  Biden tries to clarify remarks suggesting lack of diversity in the Black community
Sorry Biden is definitely a racist.
If Biden is elected the Obama coup will disappear!!üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
With Hillary they laid a foundation with Benghazi and the server a year before. The October surprise was Weiner and Comey.   What‚Äôs Trump got for a surprise? Another report on the origins of the Mueller report? If so, what‚Äôs that got to do with Biden?
"did you hear the gaffe that Biden said yesterday?" Have you not been listening to our current president for the last 3+ years?
Yes they sure do! ‚ù§Ô∏è Have a beautiful day everyone!üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è
You can‚Äôt be voting for Biden based on policy . right now is the wrong time to let some personal shit get in the way of politics üíØ #CountryOverParty #KeepAmericaGreat
Isn't it odd how Donald can't complete a single thought on TV but when it comes to Twitter he miraculously is the same way?  I‚Äôm not worried about Joe Biden‚Äôs mental capacity. I am however horrified by Donald Trumps obvious lack of mental capacity and aptitude.
I‚Äôm just pointing out why Sanders lost. It wasn‚Äôt any conspiracy, it‚Äôs just simply that not enough of his supporters voted for him. Primary turnout was horrible all around, and I‚Äôm disappointed more didn‚Äôt show up. We do need to get behind Biden, Trump needs to be stopped, now.
Ooh. Be careful. Biden #hurtgod. WTF?
Wait!!  Did Joe Robgan switch sides??? Is he voting for Biden now??
Vote alphabetically. Biden wins. You‚Äôre welcome. üòÉ
They gave people several choices in primaries, the people voted, and not enough of them. Turnout was terrible, and we got Biden because of it. If more people who tweeted and Facebooked about Sanders all day actually voted, he‚Äôd have won. They didn‚Äôt vote, the numbers don‚Äôt lie.
I‚Äôm wondering how Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù  #TrumpIsNotWell
Every American should vote for Biden. How could there be any other option?
Biden is a devote Catholic.

I would love it if Biden just decides he isn't going to do any debates. We can just check results of the last 3 and one half years to see what we don't need. Big on talk...bad on results.

Joe Biden does not need anyone's help to kill the gods.
"For the first time, the gods knew fear. They tried to flee, but it was too late. Joe Biden's heart destroyed the gods who created him and turned the heavens to ashes. To this very day, no one can oppose the beating of Joe Biden's heart."
"With fire and steel did the gods forge Biden's heart. So fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, 'On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the heavens. None can stand before it without trembling at its strength.'"
Most large groups and businesses are corrupt...lol... nothing new here unless someone is going to do something about it. Not holding my breath on that one. Corruption is running rampant in the GOP and all their buddies' big businesses. Vote for Biden!

Biden Backtracks on Cognitive Test, Immediately Has a 'Senior Moment'
Actually the Democrats because they have nothing but corruption to hide. Biden is a part of that. Trump certainly did not need to take a cognitive test because he plays 4 dimensional chess. If Biden wasn‚Äôt afraid of having a cognitive test he would take one but he won‚Äôt.
The Biden presidency can‚Äôt come soon enough. I‚Äôm so exhausted. I just want to wake up &amp; not be afraid. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
Are you even aware that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are two different people?
Joe Biden is considering Susan Rice for his VP--which pretty much means the DNC is considering Susan Rice for President. This criminal corruptocrat must never be allowed w/in breathing distance of the White House ever again.
America must re- elect president Trump. If not the Obama gate  and Biden gate will disappear, we must uphold the constitution
Woohoo! This guy validates my own prediction!! You will be OUSTED! It can't happen soon enough for America! Get the f**k out of DC and don't come back! Biden will beat Trump, says historian who predicted every presidential race since 1984
Getting really tired of the misogynistic attitudes of politics. Biden has surrounded himself with men who don't like women advancing themselves. Men can do it, but women? Oh, no, women are insulted and held back. Don't listen to them Joe, listen to your wife! She's your best bet!
Get rid of Dodd and all the other sexist idiots who hate women. If you don't believe that, look another look at what they are doing/saying. Use your own judgement and pick the best woman. Sexism casts shadow over Biden's search for a female running mate
Our major systemic corruption and dehumanization of BIPOC makes it even harder to grapple voting for Biden. He doesn‚Äôt care about these children. His administration set the precedent for these human rights violations. We need a better option #fuckthednc
Sally Yates is everything your not. Honest, credible &amp; patriotic. You‚Äôre yesterday‚Äôs news, Don. Have you started packing yet? President Biden has real work to do. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpIsAnIdiot
It takes a real political genius to tell Biden he needs to suck up to unreliable fringe elements right now. But it's good work if you can get it.
Biden is leading by 8-10. He doesn't need to beg for help from anyone. And he has that lead in large part because he is in fact seen by much of the electorate as a moderate who gives wedgies to both the Bernie dead-enders and the Trump apologists.
#ItIsWhatItIs is inhuman  #ItIsWhatItIs is ice cold  #ItIsWhatItIs is sociopathic  Trump must be voted out. We deserve empathy. We deserve a national plan. We will get both with Biden. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Factions on both the left and right with negative leverage trying to extort concessions from Biden in exchange for a tiny number of votes they will never give is quite the spectacle.
Now do Biden and his 872 stumbles and bumbles on camera. Oh yeah, he‚Äôs a dem so he‚Äôs flawless.
Trump will use emergency powers to remain in the White House if he loses election, warns House majority whip   this shit is so fucking scary..
Noticing an interesting trend in bots both here and on my FB TL that they're not just attempting to sway moderates in support of Trump, but now also looking to sway progressives away from voting for Biden.
Will  #JoeBiden  Actually #Debate #DonaldTrump  ? Let's get this straight the #MSM #MainstreamMedia are TERRIFIED about having Joe Biden out in public and confronting him in debate! They CAN'T have him showing his "Mental" issues!
Terrible what happened, but Zane would be alive today if he wasn‚Äôt out committing armed robbery and running from police. Most people get it. Defunding the police, the military and ICE, all the institutions that protect us is not the answer. Joe Biden is a mess mentally. Yes MAGA.
The only people who think Biden can't debate Trump seem to be highly selective non-U.S. Trumpers and a few Bernie dead-enders.
The health of America hinges on a Biden win. Trump is hideously unfit.
I may have to repeat myself: even if Biden picked me, a working time machine, a necromancer, Jesus Christ, the demon Lilith, Scoony-Doo or the man himself, Bernie freakin' Sanders, I will still vote Green.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man, whereas Trump‚Äôs the worst president of my lifetime. Thanks.
Biden eyes major foreign policy shifts if he¬†wins
Cutting financially desperate Americans off at the knees during a pandemic is unconscionable. Trump blew up the national debt with tax breaks for the ultra rich. Now he needs to step up for the little guy.The Senate needs to pass the Heroes Act. Pres. Biden will sort out the rest
What is the "progressive wing" going to do once they "consolidate" behind Biden? Take him from a 10-point win to an 11-point win?

what is Biden offering? NO Police NO Businesses NO freedom of Religion NO Freedom of speech etc LOL
Nope, that's your daddy. By the time Biden gets in office, there won't be any kids left..........
I didn't vote for anybody. Kinda feels the same way with Biden, but WTF I can't let one of the worst people stay president. I will vote for Biden, but not because I like him, support him but because my arm is being twisted. This is not a viable long term solution for the country.
honestly...it seems like he's trying to fuck biden up. whoever this endorsement was supposed to draw in to support Biden, the backlash from the right will be disproportionate
Just because wall street is doing well doesn't mean main street is. You've mishandled the virus and tanked the economy and Biden is the only hope we have right now.
As you know, #BenedictDonald isn't going to say anything about it on day 39, 40 nor on the day Biden is inaugurated.   Such is life in America while this serial traitor is stinking up the Oval Office. #DonTheConRussianPawn!
No matter what u feel... Trump is loosing with landslide margin. He is a psychopath... Go biden go
Wow. Someone needs a reality check. Have we all been seeing the same guy named Biden?

Yes it's called water masking. It is designed to reduce blood oxygen to the brain to incedible lows. I have heard after just one week some people have begun to understand Biden news conferances.
Obama and Biden never would have needed a ‚Äúgood big boy! So smart! Wearing a mask!‚Äù
And open slave markets began in Lybia under his watch. (Hillary, Biden, Susan Rice, etc. etc.)
Jan 3. we‚Äôll have a new Congress. More of an anti-Trump than a clear direction for change majority.  A lot of Biden vs the Dem left wing will try to spell out the new direction for the country.  Jan 20-inauguration!  There will be new pain, but ding ding the witch will be dead!
That's why everyone is going to vote for Biden
We‚Äôre going to make America great by voting for Joe Biden. #TrumpIsLosing We‚Äôre done with your COVID disaster. #TrumpIsLosing We‚Äôre done with the economic disaster. #TrumpIsLosing We‚Äôre done with the lying. #TrumpIsLosing We‚Äôre done with the bullying. #TrumpIsLosing We‚Äôre done.

Bernie isn‚Äôt on the ballot. They will vote for Biden. So, Biden voters burn down federal courthouses where religious freedoms are protected. Most Biden voters are atheists. The DN is naive to suggest Biden has anything to offer real religious voters.
Biden voters burn bibles, burn the flag, tear down statues of religious leaders, use funeral ulogies to divide and denigrate the country and demand late term abortion. Biden has nothing to offer true religious voters.
Have they not looked at Biden? He literally does the same thing. Maybe a slightly less orange shade of spray tan
"Legal challenges" to Duckworth's citizenship would help Biden.
I still doubt that. She's  living the high life now, so why give it up? Even of she took the job, we can still beat her and Biden !

What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
But you won‚Äôt condemn the violence by the Biden voters in Portland. What is wrong with you Ben?
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.

Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

I am betting Biden will do better in the popular vote than Hillary but I think Trump will win the electoral college vote, probably by a narrower margin, but he'll probably do it.
Are you even aware that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are two different people?
Joe Biden is considering Susan Rice for his VP--which pretty much means the DNC is considering Susan Rice for President. This criminal corruptocrat must never be allowed w/in breathing distance of the White House ever again.

Woohoo! This guy validates my own prediction!! You will be OUSTED! It can't happen soon enough for America! Get the f**k out of DC and don't come back! Biden will beat Trump, says historian who predicted every presidential race since 1984
Getting really tired of the misogynistic attitudes of politics. Biden has surrounded himself with men who don't like women advancing themselves. Men can do it, but women? Oh, no, women are insulted and held back. Don't listen to them Joe, listen to your wife! She's your best bet!
Get rid of Dodd and all the other sexist idiots who hate women. If you don't believe that, look another look at what they are doing/saying. Use your own judgement and pick the best woman. Sexism casts shadow over Biden's search for a female running mate
Why would delaying school in Utah have any impact on the presidential election? All church leadership could come out and say to vote for Biden and Pres. Trump would still win here. This type of stuff just serves as a rallying cry for the ‚Äúother‚Äù side.
Our major systemic corruption and dehumanization of BIPOC makes it even harder to grapple voting for Biden. He doesn‚Äôt care about these children. His administration set the precedent for these human rights violations. We need a better option #fuckthednc
Sally Yates is everything your not. Honest, credible &amp; patriotic. You‚Äôre yesterday‚Äôs news, Don. Have you started packing yet? President Biden has real work to do. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpIsAnIdiot
And, Joe Biden had literally a lifetime in government and still complains about the same problems.
I'm not even a Trump supporter but if he would've just made that cocaine comment to a black reporter, he'd never hear the end of it.   Face the truth, Biden is a creep and has said plenty of racist things over his career and the last few months.
Happy Birthday President Obama! For your birthday, we will vote in President Biden! #PresidentObama #PresidentBiden
Keep after them. What is frightening is that if Trump and Biden are locked in a tie then Pelosi will be the next President. America will be no more
At the airport, in the past month...0 Biden logos, at least 10-15 Trump each day.
And I would vote for a potted plant before voting for Joe Biden. üéçüåæ
All Biden has to do is let your old man keep talking.
It takes a real political genius to tell Biden he needs to suck up to unreliable fringe elements right now. But it's good work if you can get it.
Biden is leading by 8-10. He doesn't need to beg for help from anyone. And he has that lead in large part because he is in fact seen by much of the electorate as a moderate who gives wedgies to both the Bernie dead-enders and the Trump apologists.
#ItIsWhatItIs is inhuman  #ItIsWhatItIs is ice cold  #ItIsWhatItIs is sociopathic  Trump must be voted out. We deserve empathy. We deserve a national plan. We will get both with Biden. #TrumpFailedAmerica
Factions on both the left and right with negative leverage trying to extort concessions from Biden in exchange for a tiny number of votes they will never give is quite the spectacle.
Na,  is correct. Biden IS NOT progressive, he's a fake and a liar, and a Democrat in the center to center-right
Well I donated $1000 to Joe Biden.

Will  #JoeBiden  Actually #Debate #DonaldTrump  ? Let's get this straight the #MSM #MainstreamMedia are TERRIFIED about having Joe Biden out in public and confronting him in debate! They CAN'T have him showing his "Mental" issues!
Terrible what happened, but Zane would be alive today if he wasn‚Äôt out committing armed robbery and running from police. Most people get it. Defunding the police, the military and ICE, all the institutions that protect us is not the answer. Joe Biden is a mess mentally. Yes MAGA.
The only people who think Biden can't debate Trump seem to be highly selective non-U.S. Trumpers and a few Bernie dead-enders.
The health of America hinges on a Biden win. Trump is hideously unfit.
I may have to repeat myself: even if Biden picked me, a working time machine, a necromancer, Jesus Christ, the demon Lilith, Scoony-Doo or the man himself, Bernie freakin' Sanders, I will still vote Green.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man, whereas Trump‚Äôs the worst president of my lifetime. Thanks.
I‚Äôve seen so many people saying they‚Äôll vote for Biden based only on the fact that he‚Äôs not trump it‚Äôs insane.
Biden eyes major foreign policy shifts if he¬†wins
Cutting financially desperate Americans off at the knees during a pandemic is unconscionable. Trump blew up the national debt with tax breaks for the ultra rich. Now he needs to step up for the little guy.The Senate needs to pass the Heroes Act. Pres. Biden will sort out the rest
What is the "progressive wing" going to do once they "consolidate" behind Biden? Take him from a 10-point win to an 11-point win?

what is Biden offering? NO Police NO Businesses NO freedom of Religion NO Freedom of speech etc LOL
Nope, that's your daddy. By the time Biden gets in office, there won't be any kids left..........
I didn't vote for anybody. Kinda feels the same way with Biden, but WTF I can't let one of the worst people stay president. I will vote for Biden, but not because I like him, support him but because my arm is being twisted. This is not a viable long term solution for the country.
honestly...it seems like he's trying to fuck biden up. whoever this endorsement was supposed to draw in to support Biden, the backlash from the right will be disproportionate
Just because wall street is doing well doesn't mean main street is. You've mishandled the virus and tanked the economy and Biden is the only hope we have right now.
As you know, #BenedictDonald isn't going to say anything about it on day 39, 40 nor on the day Biden is inaugurated.   Such is life in America while this serial traitor is stinking up the Oval Office. #DonTheConRussianPawn!
No matter what u feel... Trump is loosing with landslide margin. He is a psychopath... Go biden go
Wow. Someone needs a reality check. Have we all been seeing the same guy named Biden?
I vote for total humiliation of Trump.  Just wish I was more confident Joe Biden is the man for that job.
And it's not like there is anyway Biden will win over Trump. Even if he magically gets the popular vote, the electoral college will likely prop up Trump again. The DNC doesn't care if Biden gets elected or not.
I'm not gonna fucking vote for Biden either. I have a tough time that shit will matter soon.
üé∂ Biden can‚Äôt even run his own life, I‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôll run mine. üé∂
Yes it's called water masking. It is designed to reduce blood oxygen to the brain to incedible lows. I have heard after just one week some people have begun to understand Biden news conferances.
Obama and Biden never would have needed a ‚Äúgood big boy! So smart! Wearing a mask!‚Äù
I will crawl through the Sahara Desert without a drop of water or walk through a snake filled swamp to vote for Biden!
And open slave markets began in Lybia under his watch. (Hillary, Biden, Susan Rice, etc. etc.)
And btw, Trump signed into law a bi-partisan bill that reversed some of the worst parts of the Biden bill.
Jan 3. we‚Äôll have a new Congress. More of an anti-Trump than a clear direction for change majority.  A lot of Biden vs the Dem left wing will try to spell out the new direction for the country.  Jan 20-inauguration!  There will be new pain, but ding ding the witch will be dead!
That's why everyone is going to vote for Biden

Biden has worsening cognitive issues. They will have to change this up soon.
LCD? Yeah, I hated when he said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black.‚Äù Oh, wait, that quote was from Biden, who wrote the law that increased black incarceration  2 1/2 times and did nothing to reduce black incarceration as VP to a black president
You'll see Biden's base on November 3rd
Biden has literally promised that nothing will change.  We are pretty much screwed.
If we can swallow Biden as the nominee, we might as well accept anybody he picks for VP and cabinet members.  But really, no Medicare for All?  Seriously?  In a pandemic?

Bernie isn‚Äôt on the ballot. They will vote for Biden. So, Biden voters burn down federal courthouses where religious freedoms are protected. Most Biden voters are atheists. The DN is naive to suggest Biden has anything to offer real religious voters.
Biden voters burn bibles, burn the flag, tear down statues of religious leaders, use funeral ulogies to divide and denigrate the country and demand late term abortion. Biden has nothing to offer true religious voters.
OK, who knew that Biden grew up in the same town as The Office?
What keeps me up at night? Joe Biden‚Äôs name appearing in an Epstein document a few weeks before the election. I really don‚Äôt want Trump to win, and don‚Äôt think he will, but we‚Äôve got to adopt a better way of choosing our overlords than who (of 2) separated fewer kids from parents
Have they not looked at Biden? He literally does the same thing. Maybe a slightly less orange shade of spray tan
What could possibly go wrong there?  Is Biden that intent on telling progressives to go away and get lost?
Biden head shake is a gift and we will tell you Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Clinton was more competent but was viewed in a negative light by more people. Conservatives don‚Äôt view Biden as much of a threat.
"Legal challenges" to Duckworth's citizenship would help Biden.

What's more important...correct and fair elections where everyone in our country has an equal chance to vote or a big party on election day. It's not like Biden will start the job on Nov 3rd. He will take office on January 20th.
I hope they at least let Joe Biden pick the design, after all.
But you won‚Äôt condemn the violence by the Biden voters in Portland. What is wrong with you Ben?
It wasn‚Äôt a serious idea. He said it with a question mark. Libs are so gullible. Now if Biden suggests it all the MSM, Dems and Romney RINO‚Äôs will jump on board.
He and Biden are having the same mental breakdown
Sorry but it is an indication of what's going on. And the numbers as predicted are horrible. Sorry this is all in the lap of the failed presidency and the failed Republican party. It is only going to get worse from here. Elect somebody that knows what they're doing vote Biden.
Romney is an idiot. Moving more troops into Poland and two aircraft carriers into the South China Sea is not helping Russia or China. But pompous Romney says nothing about Biden‚Äôs proposed defunding of the military.
Where does Biden has to go to get his apology from you?
Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.

I know I'm a single drop in a giant bucket, but please listen. All of the women Biden is vetting are awesome choices. None of them will harm the country, and all of them will work for positive change.
Fair enough, but you'll continue to be disappointed.  If local authorities had the ability to solve more problems (like the Constitution actually requires), Trump vs Biden wouldn't be the end of the world decision it has been made out to be.
Joe Biden can call Black people ‚ÄúNot Black‚Äù and ‚ÄúCulturally not Diverse‚Äù but is still entitled to their vote?  Please show me again where Trump is racist against Black people...
Biden won't save us from Trump. Everyone else in opposition to Trump will save us from Trump. Even Trump is doing a great job of that by alienating as many people as he possibly can. Sometimes I wonder if he is an agent saboteur working against the GOP.

I‚Äôm a black man in America and I‚Äôm disgusted with what I‚Äôve seen from Joseph  Biden he should not only be restricted from being president but  he should be forced to get A psychological evaluation

is really giving Biden A LOT of power!! According to Pedo-traitor-fuckface-moron Joe Biden could hurt God!!!!! WoW
"Shreds?" Really?  tRUmp made more of a fool of himself than he did of Biden.
If you don't think that Biden will sign the Sanders-Bowman act if Pelosi and Schumer get it on his desk, you simply don't understand the Democratic party. It's on US, the voters, progressives in congress, to set the 2020 agenda.  I guarantee he'll sign any progressive leg he can.
Biden wasn't my guy either. I am a Harris-Warren-Biden voter. But he's our guy. So we vote for him. And we work through the legislative process, and we get him the most progressive healthcare bill we can get.
So rather than acknowledging that holding onto the Senate for Biden's full term is more important than any one individual political goal, you can demand that Doug Jones endorse legislation that you couldn't even convince Democratic PRIMARY voters of.

Joe Biden has a Hanzo sword...

Probably both. Biden would have very good reason to be as careful as possible given the strength of the right-wing media, as well as keeping positive media focus on him: it's better to have people gossiping about Kamala Harris rather than Tara Reade, for one example. (1/2)
Biden has to avoid a real debate at all costs.    His only option is to have the questions in advance and let him pre-record his teleprompted responses.
I think the fact it's a forgone conclusion makes a surprise pick all the more possible. Maybe not likely but I could see Biden going with Val Demings.
Isn't it odd how Donald can't complete a single thought on TV but when it comes to Twitter he miraculously is the same way?  I‚Äôm not worried about Joe Biden‚Äôs mental capacity. I am however horrified by Donald Trumps obvious lack of mental capacity and aptitude.
i'm voting for biden because i myself can't wait for the four years of oopsies we'll be able to witness
Dude for real. First thing I thought when I saw that - ‚Äúwow, Biden wants to fight GOD?! I‚Äôm listening...‚Äù
Do 40k+ people really believe Biden wrote this? We‚Äôre in big trouble
I hear Biden‚Äôs reverse chinlock is solid, but how do bet against God with his corkscrew 450¬∞ splash AND that devastating kneeling figure-four leglock? C‚Äômon!
Does anybody have a god-doll? We need one so that god can show us where Mr. Biden hurt him.
Trump holding onto lead over Biden in Utah, new Deseret News/Hinckley Institute poll finds
Your the second person I've seen that retweeted this and it says the tweet is unavailable. It is not. It has not been deleted. Is Twitter trying to hide Biden's lame apology?
Joe Biden is ‚Äúagainst our kind of energy‚Äù. Is that oil, gas,shell,drilling, fracking energy?
The Media/Democrats are preemptively setting America up for another ‚ÄúTrump cheated‚Äù by putting out numbers like these.   If Joe Biden loses in Nov, they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúBut look at the national support. He had to have cheated cuz its just not possible that we got it so wrong.‚Äù Just wait.
I‚Äôm just pointing out why Sanders lost. It wasn‚Äôt any conspiracy, it‚Äôs just simply that not enough of his supporters voted for him. Primary turnout was horrible all around, and I‚Äôm disappointed more didn‚Äôt show up. We do need to get behind Biden, Trump needs to be stopped, now.
You kidding? You can‚Äôt compare to previous elections. People are not tethered to the media who enjoyed its power in the past. They can‚Äôt control the narrative. Biden is coatless.
Biden picking Susan Rice would be the stupidest thing he's done in his 77 years of existence. I'd rather defend Kamalas record of truancy prosecution than Benghazi and Libya attacks
I love all the incredible, passionate strong capable women Biden is considering for VP. But this here is exactly why she should be his partner in governing. This woman doesn't play around &amp; she's got no time for foolishness. She's exactly what we need right now &amp; 2024 for Pres.

Months ago, Biden said he‚Äôd announce in the first week of August, but on July 31st, they said it wouldn‚Äôt be announced until the week before the DNC convention, which starts on the 17th.
He reeks of desperation. It sounds like he‚Äôs trying to throw everything at Biden, including the kitchen sink, a stray cat, maybe a dirty glove... makes no sense, I know. Neither does Trump.
Imagine thinking that Joe wrote this. At least with Trump you know who you‚Äôre dealing with. Biden is a puppet perched atop a cabal of seruptitious operatives.
As if Joe Biden wrote this lmao
Ooh. Be careful. Biden #hurtgod. WTF?
I‚Äôll bet Joe Biden can pronounce ‚ÄúYosemite‚Äù and ‚ÄúThailand‚Äù correctly.

They gave people several choices in primaries, the people voted, and not enough of them. Turnout was terrible, and we got Biden because of it. If more people who tweeted and Facebooked about Sanders all day actually voted, he‚Äôd have won. They didn‚Äôt vote, the numbers don‚Äôt lie.
I‚Äôm wondering how Biden is going to ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù  #TrumpIsNotWell
I will vote for Kanye. Anything but Biden or Trump. I would roll the dice.
he's racist if Trump doesn't get a good 25% or more of the Black vote...otherwise he's sort of a realist...I think Biden is actually speaking for the alzheimer community although there prob aren't that many votes to get from them...their demo caretakers cast their votes for them
Going after Joe Biden‚Äôs faith is a new level of terrible
Joe Biden can‚Äôt pronounce ‚Äúmental fitness‚Äù who are you kidding??????
I still want Biden to take tRUmp out behind the school and give him a good shellacking.
Smart enough to vote for Joe BidenüòÇ what a stupid thing to say
Classier than Donald "I take my steak well done and with ketchup" sure...  But she's riden for biden because it will get her out of the hellhole she's in.
Is it worse then blaming a pandemic on someone like Biden is unsuccessfully trying to do as he stumbles and mumbles through so called speeches.
I bet the first lady is a secret Biden supporter.
Wouldn't it be nice if  just once, he talked about he's going to do instead of trash Biden for what he thinks he won't do?
You‚Äôve attended DNC meetings, so you know for a fact they choose for Biden?
Defenders of Two Corinthians, unite!
The news cycle today was supposed to be  focused on Biden's statement on Hispanics and black Americans which honestly isn't that big a deal. Instead we're talking about how Biden will hurt God lol
‚ÄúThese people are too dumb to not vote for Kanye, monkey see monkey do‚Äù  - Biden if the DNC let him speak publicly for more than 10 minutes without promising him his daily CBT
Please don't talk until November and then after. Let your VP run the nation.

The latest Iowa polls released in the last month:   Data for Progress: Trump +2 RMG: Trump +1  David Binder Research: Biden +6 Monmouth: Trump +2  So, even if you conclude David Binder is a partisan poll, that's three in the last couple days showing Trump's lead no more than two.

Imagine believing this buffoon that a man named Joe Biden could hurt your god.
I would love it if Biden just decides he isn't going to do any debates. We can just check results of the last 3 and one half years to see what we don't need. Big on talk...bad on results.
‚ÄúThighland‚Äù. But yes, let‚Äôs talk about Biden‚Äôs cognizance.
Even though the national media is touting the polls showing Joe Biden up, it‚Äôs not looking good for Joe in the critical areas that he needs to win. With his energy policy, there‚Äôs no way in hell that Pennsylvania votes for Joe Biden. Trump is going to carry Florida as well.
fodder* ... And the right doesn't need any fodder. Any person who's watced Joe Biden over the past few months must be concerned about his deterioration. It's to the point now that he literally can't get through a single interview without it being a complete shit show. Unreal
If God doesn‚Äôt care that babies die of cancer, he sure as hell won‚Äôt care if Joe Biden is the next POTUS.

Who are these people?! My super conservative lifetime Republican family is voting for Biden.  These people are just plain racists. That‚Äôs it. 50% of white Americans are the KKK.
This is stupid, so if Biden doesn't pick who YOU want you are just going to vote for trump? Great...way to phone that in. All in together to make this right and get this traitorous monster out of our damn house, step up and stop being an entitled whiner.
Pres. DJT: ‚ÄúI had such a great life, but that is ok‚Äù....the POTUS left comfortable personal space to be an even greater patriot. The DC MOB is angry, they can no longer completely sellout Americans for their personal gain. More needs to be done. Sliden‚Äô Biden is an empty suit.
Biden will hurt God? As an Irish-Catholic, I'm pretty sure it's the other way around.
‚ÄúAlso, unlike Biden, many of his supporters aren't due to cult of personality.‚Äù  That‚Äôs laughable. Bernie is the center of a cult of personality so strong, only Trump‚Äôs is larger.
I mean, I think it‚Äôs definitely iffy. But I also hope that Biden‚Äôs time in office is shorter than that of William Henry Harrison, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Unlike you, Bunker Boy, President Biden will uphold the Constitution.  The 1st and 2nd amendments will still stand.  The difference is they will be applied equally to all citizens.  You are desperate and so you are fear mongering.  Pack your bags.
Biden's a racist alright, sincerely a Mexican.
My husband saw a Biden bumper sticker on a car just this morning in our SLC neighborhood! It was such a weird sighting he had to comment on it. Before that we'd only seen yard signs for "Dump Trump" and "Any Functional Adult 2020."

This is news to me. How did they conspire? Everything I saw showed a fair primary. Bernie lost, Biden won. But Bernie is still in office, and still has a significant presence in our government.
But you do live in this country, so help make it better. Voting for Biden, even with his flaws, is a step in the right direction. He will bring a competent cabinet with him, and restore our place in the world.

Biden stuns critics with new pledge to attack and dethrone god
"For the first time, the gods knew fear. They tried to flee, but it was too late. Joe Biden's heart destroyed the gods who created him and turned the heavens to ashes. To this very day, no one can oppose the beating of Joe Biden's heart."
"With fire and steel did the gods forge Biden's heart. So fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, 'On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the heavens. None can stand before it without trembling at its strength.'"
First, eliminate all Blacks that aren't voting for him (they ain't Black enough). All the rest with "wrongthink" are the "notable exceptions"   Keep asking questions like this, and Biden will eventually revoke your "Black" card.
IS THIS STILL OK WITH BLACKS?  Biden Says the Latino Community Is Incredibly Diverse, 'Unlike the African-American Community'
That's not true at all. The "Democrat victory plan" image you posted is ridiculous and deceitful. Don't try and paint me as some die-hard democrat conspirator, Biden is a shitty candidate but he is still light years better than Trump. What are your reasons for supporting Trump?
No chance that a white cis female will be Biden's VP and his replacement.  I do agree Warren would be much more competent than Biden who is in rapid cognitive decline.    The DNC stole the nomination from Bernie twice now.
They DO always change the subject. Dont they? This has zero to do with Biden, but since you mentioned it NO he doesn't want us to be Cuba. He wants us to be a safe, free, compassionate USA that isnt an embarrassment to the rest of the world.

But Biden is going to win.  He will be the next president.  He will turn 80 in the middle of his first term.  His mental state is important to the country.
Trump has to lie. He has no power in the truth. His deflection about Biden‚Äôs capability is clearly a desperate attempt to obscure his own cognitive decline. Trump thinks he can‚Äôt win without lying &amp; cheating, when the truth is that TRUMP CAN‚ÄôT WIN AT ALL. #TrumpThreatensAmerica

I agree. I'm not a big Biden fan either. I'm paying close attention to the VP and cabinet picks, those could help me feel better about it than today.
Wrong again by the in made him change his stance America was an even 50% in support at the time when Obama switched from being educated Eventually because of Biden in a bomber support America got on board in the Supreme Court made it legal
Got you. Unfortunately, one can argue not voting or not voting for Biden is also a vote for Trump. It can also feel like a non-Republican vote in Utah doesn't matter anyway.
Avain because of GOP &amp; alt -left. You blame Biden to fit your brainwashing &amp;  narrative. So muxh for listening. Just want to spread your lies,  misinformation, talking points  &amp; propaganda
Yup. Not defending Biden here, or the Democratic Party for nominating him, but I'll take him over Trump any day.
I see the same political games as 2016 undermining the Democratic presumptive candidate. The DNC needs to stop political infighting when we are 90 days out from the election, and we have a president in the White House who will do anything to win. ANYTHING
I don't think this is going to turn out well for you Joe.
Just put him on the plane and tell him he is in Delaware. People who are abusing Joe Biden, in his condition, have no shame. #FreeJoe

Joe Biden is obviously unable to help himself. What is Jill thinking? Joe should be on a beach or poolside somewhere, telling rambling stories. #stopAbusingJoe
Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.   Yo Semite.   Biden has a stutter but I‚Äôll bet he can say ‚ÄúYosemite‚Äù correctly.
I respectfully disagree. Lincoln Project's ads are hitting home in a way the Biden and the DNC ads aren't.
I'll go even further. Trump is actually right on alot of things. So is Biden. It's the "how" that makes all the difference. Truth is truth like a vaccine is a vaccine and a virus is a virus. Data is data and science is science. It's what Trump does with the data is the problem.
Biden  has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and the VP.  An announcement is coming any day now
Despite being a devout Catholic Biden believes in a strong separation of church and state
Biden has &amp; will protect a women's right to choose &amp; access to healthcare
Although lie to by the Bush Administration, Biden voted to protect America after 911 attack by voting for the Iraq war
Biden has stood up for dreamers &amp; DACA. Will stop mass  deportations &amp; children in cages. Have a pathway to  citizenship

The only people who will vote for Kanye in Wisconsin are disillusioned Trump voters who would never vote for Biden in the first place and teenagers who would have otherwise stayed home. Polls showed Amash wouldn't have moved the needle, do they really think Kanye will?
That's why the youth &amp; POC came out for Biden because he has a universal health plan and hes adopted Warren's plan and stood in debt in a Harris will just add to that momentum &amp; enthusiasm. Its was a total rejection of Bernie, his toxic cult, his ideas &amp; Russian friends
Which president needs to take a cognitive test? Trump is the only president where his actual cognitive ability has been called into question. Of course Biden shouldnt have to take one! Man woman camera person tv!
VP: TRUE PRESIDENT for Biden won‚Äôt last 2 years...
Hmm, where was this neutral meeting with the FBI, AG Yates, Obama, Biden and others held do discuss Flynn investigation? Oh ya, the Oval Office. Either you want the truth or you don‚Äôt. Either you are perpetrating lies or you are not.
Not just any  funeral, but that of a civil rights leader, John Lewis. Biden was there while he  laid in state. Harris, Booker,   Speaker Pelosi &amp; Presidents Clinton, Bush &amp; Obama where st the funeral, where was Bernie? someone who calls himself a civil rights icon would be there
Biden is confused, and It‚Äôs time everyone admits it. Time to put in some else
Joe Biden is considering Susan Rice for his VP--which pretty much means the DNC is considering Susan Rice for President. This criminal corruptocrat must never be allowed w/in breathing distance of the White House ever again.
The DNC has no place in conversation at all. They a great  organization that help lifts up people &amp;  foster  Patriotic leadership. But its fair to talk about a failed insurrection &amp; so one who's actively trying to lie &amp; undermine the progress that's trying to be made by Biden
We're going to elect Biden.
It‚Äôs obvious to me that he‚Äôll make gaffs or be forgetful which our current president has done in multiple scenarios.   This isn‚Äôt a cognitive issue. It‚Äôs normal for people to do this and both Trump and Biden aren‚Äôt infallible in these areas.
I'm sure Biden does have a few shortcomings as everyone does but he has an amazing record &amp; inspiring agenda to move America forward. That the honest truth &amp; facts !
Bernie's disrespect of not bothering to show up while John Lewis was laying in state or his funeral shows a lack of character &amp; leadership. A slap in the face to a major voting block! Biden has an amazing record of service &amp; inspiring  Agendadespote your lies.
Stop the presses! Alert the media! Pigs fly! Hell has frozen over!
You keep bring up DNC, another Trump, GOP, Fox &amp; Russian talking point. It was American Patriots &amp;  educate voters who rejected Bernie &amp;  nominated Biden. A champion of the common person with an inspiring agenda of progress
Sally Yates has great credibility and has ZERO to do with any of your political crimes. Obama &amp; Biden are actually two separate people but yes they are both intelligent. Democrats dont have time for games; they're busy trying to fix the bs your GOP stuffed pockets are pulling.
Did cognitive tests might show Biden‚Äôs dementia has intensified past the point of him being to pronounce ‚ÄúMilwaukee‚Äù?
Why can't you answer a simple question? Guess its not in your cult programing or talking points.  You're inventionis history is wrong as usual. The voters rejected Bernie &amp; choose Biden
Bernie has done nothing, not one thing passed! America will never be  Venezuela. His ideas are not doable &amp; toxic. Biden's are better so he won
More GOP &amp; Russian lies &amp; talking points. Biden  Still Katie to his whole life in-and-out of government to helping people in those without a voice his record speaks for itself in its amazing and inspiring. What has Bernie done, other then become the richest  person in Senate?
Methinks a big reason why some trump voters will be voting for Biden this time around is because Biden is not Hillary.
Biden is not a particularly effective debater, though.
He‚Äôs too üêìüí© to come out from his bunker &amp; let the nation see how #dementia has taken its course! ‚Å¶ | Biden won‚Äôt travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination amid coronavirus concerns
Your  misinformed or  ignorant of Biden's inspiring record of service to helping those who normally don't have a voice. As a member of the alt-left &amp; Bernie's cult you'e extremely gullible. Russians must love you, easy to manipulate. Time to put country 1st
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president. Yeah, he said that. It's Tucker. He's Trump's new best friend. Faux Fox News airs his racism so the rest of Fox's hosts can then fit into their own stuff. Evil!
What are you talking about? Biden won the primary, plenty of hack corporate, centrist Dems. Unfortunately.
My Grandfather loved children &amp; was very affectionate to them, and NO he was not a pedophile, just a loving tender man, Biden lost his daughter at a young age and perhaps that's why.  Its sad these day that good men can't hug kids without people thinking bad things about them.
Joe Biden Will Accept The Democratic Nomination In Delaware
If you worked with oil and gas, you shouldn‚Äôt work in the White House.
Yeah, same here. Rural Nevada. They're just...around.
It's a con. Biden's handlers don't want him to be their prez the just want him to win the election. If he wins Biden will step down within 12 months.
I don‚Äôt like Biden but I support him hiding in his basement...that‚Äôs what I do and I‚Äôm not such a bad guy
America must re- elect president Trump. If not the Obama gate  and Biden gate will disappear, we must uphold the constitution
Health officials in Wisconsin have informed the Dem Convention Committee that speakers should no longer travel to Milwaukee due to COVID-19.

Yep. They tried to smear her last week by accusing her of not supporting Joe Biden which we know is a lie and after all the stuff they did and Cori Bush winning is like a kick in the teeth times 10 to the establishment.

Biden dismissing protestors as anarchists and arsonists is a prime example. This gets people beat up and thrown in prison for felonies
Getting really tired of the misogynistic attitudes of politics. Biden has surrounded himself with men who don't like women advancing themselves. Men can do it, but women? Oh, no, women are insulted and held back. Don't listen to them Joe, listen to your wife! She's your best bet!
Get rid of Dodd and all the other sexist idiots who hate women. If you don't believe that, look another look at what they are doing/saying. Use your own judgement and pick the best woman. Sexism casts shadow over Biden's search for a female running mate
Biden is a terrible candidate, but yes, what's the ham sandwiches policy on climate change and fighting global pedo rings
Polls where right for  Hillary. Russia  interfered &amp; hacked votes. Plus Bernie did everything he could to  undermined her &amp; DNC. Clinton was never as far ahead as Biden, was a very close race in 2016. Why play game? Just admit you're a Trumper &amp; want to re-elect him

I REALLY hope that on election night in November when the state that puts Biden over the top is called (ü§ûü§ûü§û), Trump's campaign peeps turn to him and say "It is what it is." and then walk out of the room. And that someone films it.
Only in appearance, not context. Biden gains by just letting Trump speak his craziness. Biden just needs to looks undead.  Cox is avoiding a strong smart challenger and has the room to fall in the polls. Facing Peterson would expose him.
You're under the great delusion that you're part of many or a large movement you're not you're small &amp; insignificant cult (like Jonestown) your insurrection is dead. Vote or not, just get used to President BidenIm telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.

Just read his clarification on what he really meant.  Is it just me or did he just reiterate his initial statement? Haha reading a Joe Biden quote is way harder than hearing him say it.
Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
If Biden's VP pick is not Kamala, you'll vote for Trump?  That's not a very smart plan.   Just thought you should know.
Does he remember who it is? #Biden
What we really needed was Bernie. Needed him 4 years ago, needed him now, but the DNC fucked him in the ass once again, and gave us an establishment puppet. Biden is the status quo for the establishment. Still not as bad as the GOP
So did you not vote for the green tax incentives that helped his company grow, or did you forget, like Biden
I am beginning to think Biden does not have a stutter or cognitive issues.   He has a shock collar on and his handlers are zapping him every time he is about to say something stupid.     Sometimes they miss though

Biden must be a pretty powerful Titan If he has the ability to hurt a god. Zeus blood in those genes????
If he wins the nation as we know it is over, I really believe that. Not because of Biden, but because the far left own Biden. Assuming democrats win that also means they hold the house and win the senate (most likely) green new deal, single payer, abortion at birth it‚Äôs coming
Joe is an expert at the whole ‚Äòsneak up behind you and shamelessly smell you technique‚Äô.  Trumps a bit taller than Biden‚Äôs usual victims though.

And it's not like there is anyway Biden will win over Trump. Even if he magically gets the popular vote, the electoral college will likely prop up Trump again. The DNC doesn't care if Biden gets elected or not.

Bernie isn‚Äôt on the ballot. They will vote for Biden. So, Biden voters burn down federal courthouses where religious freedoms are protected. Most Biden voters are atheists. The DN is naive to suggest Biden has anything to offer real religious voters.

Trump gets things done. He has held true to most of his promises and I'd like to see what more he can accomplish. Biden is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the left's agenda. If he wins, I don't think it will be him running the show, it will be all of the extreme liberals.

Lol. Last thing trump wants to do is debate. That‚Äôs why they keep putting out the lie Biden won‚Äôt debate, when in fact he‚Äôs agreed to 3.
And a majority of those democrats still realize that Joe Biden‚Äôs healthcare policy will get the closest to what those 87% support than anyone ever has. Voting for the other guy means you won‚Äôt get it, because the conservative-packed courts will overturn it if it ever gets passed.
It‚Äôs official America has 2 unstable men teaming up to run against Biden! Yup!!! Its going to take more than 2 unstable cables (Trump and Kanye) to play dirty tricks to win. Roll your sleeves boys it ain‚Äôt going to be easy sleezies
LMAO disaster? You'll see the real deal if Biden is elected! How will the stock market respond to increased taxes and regulations....answer that dummy
Say what you will about Trump (and I do, I‚Äôd never vote for him), but the cool thing about this is that Biden will sleep through it all too!
Thanks. As a Presidential Elector, I was fortunate to have special tickets to the inauguration and was in the seats below the balcony. Here are the swearing in photos of President Obama and Vice President Biden.
If you want some one like Biden who can't walk or talk then you are nuts

Biden, you‚Äôre the joke.
Congrats, you are literally the FIRST person to make a point about Biden's policy, instead of just railing about Trump. Or how left independents are ruining a party they aren't even registered to ü§£ you win!
I got email, I thought from your campaign to ask for input, I included some creative ideas and donated money and the send button did not work. Hmm. (Russians?) is it true Biden's and your campaign money collected is down.
You realize the  and  work in concert, right? Biden is just another puppet of the oligarchy.
This is quite the exaggeration. Biden is a right-wing Trojan-Horse. He is arguably the farthest right in the Democratic Party. We all know the  is just the other head of the right-wing oligarchy. If you haven't figured it out by now, I know of 103 fascist billionaire donors
I already know the Obama/Biden admin and their goons DID!
What makes you think Biden and his administration won't abuse that power? Rmember Standing Rock? Who was the Pres. and VP then?

It's pretty stupid to ignore the very real possibility Biden will still allow fascism to further take root.
1- not really. Biden has already threatened protesters and "violent anarchists," same language as Trump, and promised nothing will change. 2- 1994 Crime Bill. New Jim Crow. Mass Incarceration. 3- *MIGHT* Biden hasn't come out against the expanded powers he and Obama gave DHS

How can it be a vote for Trump when the Right says it is a vote for Biden?  Or maybe nobody owns your damn vote but you, and it goes directly and ONLY to who you vote for.  This faulty logic is why we continue to have a two-party duopoly working in kahoots for their donors

Got that wrong look into Biden‚Äôs ‚Äútax plan‚Äù yo
Joe Biden's worsed words are a tiny fraction of the hate that boils in your diseased mind 24/7.
- Ban "assault weapons" - Set a harmful precedent with a national mask mandate - Expand our unconstitutional wars - Ramp up the drug war and police militarization - Break healthcare more - Expand anything he wrote bills about badly  Biden is a terrible candidate.
She made a career sending innocent people to labor camps. Close enough.  Trump and Biden are both awful, vote for Dr. Jorgensen.  #LetHerSpeak #SpikeTheDebates
No, but they're both completely awful candidates. Biden has 40 years of bad legislating. Nobody should vote for either of them.
Electing a different "B team despot" is not the solution. Biden is an awful candidate, just as bad as Trump. Maybe worse because he'd face less obstruction from Congress.
With no evidence or discussion? I guess I'm not surprised. If you act according to the Blue No Matter Who trend you'll block me next.  Why do you think Biden is worth your vote?
That's never going to happen without a 3rd party. If we elect Biden we'll just see Trump 2.0 in 4-8 years. Why not vote for real change now instead of kicking the can down the road? Biden and Trump are existential threats to our democracy, neither is worth your vote. #LetHerSpeak
endorses Biden/Harris, which would probably be appalling to Lincoln, as would Trump/Pence. They clamor for the sneeches with stars: Republicrats are all the same now.  Vote Libertarian ( if you want real change for real people. #LetHerSpeak
And the Dems don‚Äôt want her to be POTUS in March when Biden is 25th amendment-ed out of office.
I‚Äôve seen plenty of criticism of her service as prosecutor, the fact that just months ago she fizzled out as a candidate, or that she recently called Joe Biden a racist and believed his accusers but is now running alongside him which makes her phony.  That‚Äôs not sexist or racist.
Joe Biden held a press conference today but took no questions. Instead be said that "every person in the USA needs to wear a face mask when they are outside for the next 3 months". Hmmm ü§îSeptember, October, November. Wear masks until election day?
Man your a hypocrite and her too so it‚Äôs ok for her to say she believes all of the women who accused Biden and now all good what happened to MeToo doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative any longer
If you can‚Äôt even remember what you said then that means 2 things.  1. I see how you relate to joe biden 2. The ‚Äúgifted‚Äù part of your kids must be from your husbands side  (Alternate option 2. Your kids aren‚Äôt gifted, they‚Äôre just smarter than you, which isn‚Äôt saying much)
This is a good list of things to keep in mind when voting comes in November. Supporting Biden has been hard for me because I was so excited to see representation of my progressive views, however I cannot forget the importance of what's laid out here.
this is hilarious, the incumbent say horrible things about almost everyone daily....Harris and Biden made up, he should try it.
Getting the Libertarian Party 5% of the vote and FEC funding will be a much more impactful victory long-term than electing Biden or Trump. It's the only way we're ever going to have more choices in the future. #LetHerSpeak by voting for her this eleciton even if she won't win.
The thing I don't get about "voting for biden is stemming the tide" mentality is ok let's say we get biden in office; then what?? You're being very naive if you believe we can "root out corruption" from the system because the system IS CORRUPTION plain and simple
I'll be protesting in person if they don't include him. Utahns want more voices and more choices. Trump and Biden do not represent most Americans.

Sexist slight? Wow just overlooked ole Biden my man has made lots of slights
Interesting thatTrump said, 1) She has said many thinks that aren‚Äôt true, 2) She was disrespectful of Joe Biden, and 3) She wants to take health care away for millions of Americans. Is President Trump trying to claim that she‚Äôs running as VP on the wrong ticket?
Biden is also an existential threat. Neither has regard for the rights protected by the Constitution. Picking Harris confirms it.  Dr. Jo Jorgensen is the only candidate worth voting for. She gets it and has real solutions that don't involve stripping rights. #LetHerSpeak
I was making a jab at those wanting to defund the police while simultaneously rejoicing in Biden‚Äôs VP pick  But yes, voting for chiefs of police and other high ranking officials could only help with our current situation as well!
You people are missing the point!!!  The biggest difference between Trump and Biden is that Trump is an awful person.  If Biden is gaffing and revealing himself as a racist and picking an awful running mate, that key difference is lessened, even if not overcome. It helps Trump.
You‚Äôre missing the point.   If Biden wants to separate himself morally from Trump, picking an awful, homewrecking skank as VP is a bad move.
Well Biden just ruined my theory about the election and his running mate, kinda pissed I wanted to be rightüôÉ
Haha üòÇ damn just handed the election to Trump...I mean this is the same person who all but called Biden a predator
I'm right of center &amp; I think Kamala is a good selection for Biden. She makes the ticket stronger. Will we see human decency and a return to presidential statesmanship, character and unified leadership that comes with the highest office in the world? I hope so. #GOP #UTPOL
Gee, here's a surprise
That‚Äôs statement would‚Äôve been true no matter who was picked for Biden.
I was out of the country how did all those picks work out?  Biden picks someone who all but accused him of being a predator this is hilarious
This morning Joe Biden announced his VP pick, this afternoon he forgot who it was that he announced. üòÉ
Even if it takes locking people away for life for no reason, or withholding evidence that could prevent someone from being murdered by the government?  I think somehow you might be an even worse candidate than Biden.

Zelda Williams Calls Out Eric Trump For Posting Late Father‚Äôs Biden Jokes To ‚ÄúFurther Political Agenda‚Äù
You‚Äôre already starting from a place of assumption. Biden is ostensibly more racist than Trump. Yes he‚Äôs an idiot, but so‚Äôs Biden. Hunter Biden is as swampy as they get. The tax cut helped nearly 70% of Americans.  Add in abortion, socialism, and the antagonizing...it‚Äôs not hard.
The power tower needs to fall. The office of President is a lightning rod for sociopaths, narcissists, and liars like Trump and Biden. I'm voting for the candidate who's promising to dismantle it instead of just polishing it.
wwwONE and your minions are going after Biden gaffes?
"There's questionable activity" sounds like a loophole to let plant possession replace getting a warrant. Dr. Jorgensen would end warrantless and no-knock raids, especially those only justified by drugs.  If you want prison reform, Biden is absolutely the worst candidate for it.
OK, more recently: Biden helped Obama expand our endless unconstitutional wars, ramp up the war on drugs, put children in cages at the border, sign a harmful NDAA that contradicts the 6th amendment, force poor people to pay for inaccessible healthcare.. He's a real bad candidate.
Yes, not only is there no guarantee Biden would help, there are literally decades of contraindicators. The Democratic Party is just as corrupt, irresponsible, out of touch, and unwilling to account as the Republican Party. It's time for real change for real people.  #LetHerSpeak
I feel like you've got your hands over your eyes. Almost every harmful thing Trump is doing or has done, Biden wrote laws to enable or sat quiet as VP when precedents were set.  Don't vote for a bad candidate. The cycle has to stop sometime because it's just going to get worse.
Biden's been in office for decades and many of his votes and speeches are public record. It's irresponsible to just dismiss alarmed summaries of them as propaganda out of fear. Can you honestly say that you think Biden is a good candidate?
Why do you think that would not happen under Biden? He has a long career of voting for cronyism, racism, and heavy, harmful authoritarianism. He's just a fascist with a smile instead of all-caps tweets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Again, what are the consequences? 4 more years of Trump? That's equally abhorrent to me as 4+ years of Biden. Why do you think Biden should be favored over Trump?
I voted for  in 2016 because Gary said bake the cake, &amp; other reasons I honestly don't remember now. I saw Evan speak in person &amp; he appealed to moderation. I don't like his implicit endorsement of Biden this year, and I regret not helping grow the Libertarian Party.
I'd rather help the LP make real than check a box for a terrible candidate just to spite a different terrible candidate. Biden and Trump both represent the wrong way for America. We need a more constrained executive branch or we'll just keep repeating this cycle.
How would Biden magically fix things if he were elected? And if he has all the solutions, why didn't he let Obama know, or implement them during his 40 years in congress instead of pushing racism, imperialism, &amp; cronyism to hurt minorities and the poor? Biden is a bad candidate.
No he got elected because people are tired of politicians who have been in office for decades and have done üí©....you know like Biden
I see it as a waste in any situation. Why vote for either racist lying clown when you can help the Libertarian Party get at least 5% of the vote and secure Federal Election Commission funding? That's a much more impactful victory than electing Trump or Biden.
is the only candidate worth a vote this year. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump: Biden supported laws that got us so divided and hurt, and he sat idly as VP for more.  Dr. Jorgensen has real change for real people, not more of the broken same. #LetHerSpeak
Lots of people talking abt the political ramifications of Biden‚Äôs VP pick, but I‚Äôm very interested to see how her name is incorporated into his logo and branding ü§î
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I‚Äôm fully aware of the definitions, genius.  Anyway, do you think Joe Biden is racist? There‚Äôs as much or more evidence to suggest that he‚Äôs as racist as Trump.
The democrats wanted those things done too though, Biden is literally running on the basis of some of those.
Getting Trump out is a phyrric victory if it means we get Biden instead, and if Trump or Biden wins we're going to see the same dilemma in 2024. Voting R or D instead of L is like arguing about how to paint the walls when the foundation is cracked and sinking. #LetHerSpeak
He just lost the election...how do you think "defund social security and medicare is going to going to sound when the Biden campaign starts using this?

You've been talking in circles, but I'm glad you can at least admit that Biden is not a good candidate.  Hopefully you'll take the next step and vote for real change this year instead of kicking the can down the road.  Do you think we should #LetHerSpeak in the debates?

LITERALLY all Trump had to do was take the virus seriously, wear a mask, and set strict social distancing measures and we would've seen so many people on the fence vote for him.   Instead he treated it like a fucking joke and now has pushed moderates to Biden's side.  Fuck Trump
You still haven't said why a Biden Presidency would not also lead to that. Why do you think he's a good candidate?  #LetHerSpeak

If the election were today, it would be very likely Biden‚Äôs VP would be POTUS in less than a year.   I‚Äôm not happy about that, but that‚Äôs where we are at the moment.
Biden is slip sliding away. He needs to retire &amp; spend his days fishing and reading to his grandchildren. (Notice how I didn‚Äôt say have his grandkids jumping on his lap?) I cant imagine an America where we elect a man who will choose who the leader will be. He won‚Äôt last a week .
This candidate: - Clearly lives an adventurous life - Has to use the normal healthcare system instead of whatever fluffy stuff Trump &amp; Biden have: she gets it - Is transparent about her personal health &amp; fitness for office - Might be Batman  There's no downside to voting for her.
I hear ya brother! And Biden is from Kenya!
He's not creepy Joe Biden.
Biden is definitely not that candidate. There's a huge chunk of people turned off by Biden's history. Those people will either go grudgingly to Trump or not vote. That's who Jorgensen wins. This election is too important to split the vote with Biden. Maybe he can run in 2028.
Biden didn't write it, but he claims credit for it and he laid the groundwork.   And Trump signed its renewal this year. They're both awful candidates.
You're not too familiar with Biden's career before Vice President, are you?
Some guy on Twitter would almost certainly be a better choice than Biden.
Why do you think she has no chance? If it's just because you think not enough people will vote for her, then you should be committing to vote for her to help fix that.  It's not a protest vote. If she weren't running I wouldn't vote. Trump &amp; Biden are both threats to our country.
No, but I would gladly wait much longer to vote FOR  Trump and Biden are both awful candidates. I'll be voting for an excellent one instead.  #LetHerSpeak #EndQualifiedImmunity #EndTheDrugWar #EndTheATF #VoteGold2020
This began pre-2016. Trump rallied people mad at how Obama ran things. Many are rightly upset but deceived about who/what Trump is/does. If we elect Biden or reelect Trump we're going to continue this toxic cycle because neither has anything good ideas except "not the other guy".
should we question if Biden is more sane than trump
Don't vote for either, vote for  Biden isn't just a fiddly old man who says silly things, he wrote, supported, and still defends some of the most harmful legislation passed during his 40 years in Congress. He shows us who he is, we should believe him.  #JoNotJoe

this was the good part; you wore a mask...then it went crazy wen you basically said Biden was the antichrist
joe biden is an idiot,,, go back to the basement
....and "all your guns will immediately taken away without warning".... how can anyone on his team attack Biden for mental issues?
Here's the full context:   Trump doesn't care about the 2nd or 4th amendments. He's an awful candidate just like Biden.
I'm fed up with people flashing the Ron Paul badge like it means they're an authority on something. No, your past support of Paul doesn't mean you're right about supporting Biden. It means you gave up and ran back to the problem parties. I don't take winning advice from quitters.
We need to stop voting for bad candidates, not continue like an addict saying they can stop whenever they want but they just need a hit to get through work.  Stop voting for bad candidates. Is Biden a bad candidate? Yes he is, so don't vote for him. Same with Trump.
It will never be "the year". We're going to continue on the death spiral until we start voting 3rd party en masse. If Biden gets elected we'll see Trump 2.0 in 2024 &amp; it won't be the year. If Trump wins we'll have Mega Biden to "fix" 8 years of tantrums &amp; it won't be the year.
No police and no guns? Is this an ad in favor of Biden?
Biden is a devout catholic. Trump can‚Äôt name a single verse in the bible and says he‚Äôs never asked God for forgiveness. Who do you think is the real Christian?
Still not calling out Biden‚Äôs racist comments ehIt seemed like they picked her to take the seat when biden inevitiably becomes unfit mentally
For the second election in a row they‚Äôve had a pretty easy opportunity for a landslide victory... and blown it both times lol I still would predict Biden wins, but not by as much as they could‚Äôve won if they nominated someone decent lol
What a load of misinformation. Biden along with the European allies requested a corrupt individual retired. And they got the money. No election interference. Trump tied duties of office (oval office visit) to something of personal value. It is so opposite its funny.
I don't watch any of the cable news channels. Who said your a racist if you mispronounce Kamala Harris's name? Biden mispronouncing her name doesn't surprise me.
All I'm saying is that Trump's entire presidency has signs of senility. Much more than what weve seen from Biden.  I'd take a Biden administration in a fraction of a heartbeat before another Trump administration, regardless of Biden's shortcomings.
And Joe Biden molested one of his staff and you ignore it.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.
Hmmm, trying to keep the focus off of Biden and his diminishing cognitive abilities?
I‚Äôm gop too I talk all the time to some great democrats. And through those conversations I see what teump and his supporters are snd will be voting Biden/Harris.
No thank you.  This republican us voting Biden/Harris
Thank god im not part of that stupid squad!!!  Independent and free women for Biden/Harris.
Kampala, in your own words you have said Biden is a sexual predator, and a racist. Now you‚Äôre his running mate. You can‚Äôt make this üí© up! This is your Democratic Party in all its glory.
If Biden is elected, your health insurance will mirror the failures of the USPS. The government couldn‚Äôt run a hot dog stand efficiently!
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
So untrue, our 401k took off when President Trump was elected after being stagnant under Obama and Biden.  Our retirement income has greatly improved.
Fun fact, trump knew who was the VP pick before Biden even knew. But then Biden forget until he read the teleprompter.
why can‚Äôt you have an opinion without people jumping down your throat and saying well if you support this you DONT support this blah blah blah I don‚Äôt love Kamala she actually isn‚Äôt that great but y‚Äôall we need trump OUT and voting for Biden is the best way out. #wishitwasbernie
Yes. It makes me angry that they ignore the popular candidates and insist on corporate centrists who probably won‚Äôt fix what they need to. I have hope in winning the Senate, and I‚Äôll vote for Biden anyway, but the Dems would‚Äôve done so much better if they‚Äôd just let Bernie win
True on the second part, which is why it‚Äôs such a maddening choice. And I‚Äôm probably too reluctant to believe Utahns can always be so idiotic, but Biden is a centrist and they‚Äôve seen Trump for what he is the last four years
I basically agree with you guys, which makes it even more infuriating that electing the Dems is still critical with Trump and his cronies destroying the country more and more permanently than anyone ever, and Biden probably can be swayed because he doesn‚Äôt really believe in much
Just as NYT Opinion Page spread anti-HRC propaganda in 2016,... Greensit will surely manage the anti-Biden Opinion Page for NYT  this election.  A reputation that took decades to build gone in the matter of 2 election cycles... Guess that's what doing business w/Ru mob can do.
Now do Joe Biden. You people could not be any dumber.
I've been learning about Kamala's smart digital following and ways...
Saw my first post from a Democrat attacking Kamala Harris because she used to be a cop and that Biden had lost their vote. My eyes almost rolled out of their sockets.
What kind of research you been doing? The man touches little kids, can‚Äôt remember what he said 30 seconds ago and once again been in office for 47 YEARS and hasn‚Äôt done shit to BETTER AMERICANS daily lives. Trumps down more in 4 years than Biden‚Äôs done ever
New Zealand hasn‚Äôt had a Rona case in 100 days. Wonder why oh wait hydrocloroquine something trump said worked: I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs perfect but good god if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see the writing on the wall for putting Biden‚Äôs old dumbass in office we‚Äôre fucked.
Lol y‚Äôall brainwashed. Biden‚Äôs been in politics for 47 years and hasn‚Äôt done shit. Trumps been in office for 4 and had the lowest unemployment EVER, that‚Äôs for all races since Black lives matter, put out bills to help child sex trafficking. To be continued
Wrong. We ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äôs‚Äù are a myth you generated in your pea brain. We women are educated, co equals in our families, raise children and bring in the bacon. We‚Äôre voting Biden Harris.
Yes, but Biden will I'll surround himself with qualified, adept, decent humans who will do their best to rebuild what the sociopath and his cabal (&amp; family) of corrupt, racist, entitled monsters have destroyed. Therein lies the difference.
Lol  really backed Biden hoping to be vp shitting on her apparent long time friend  only to not get the VP nom and still shat on Bernie who could have gotten alot garter if she would have backed him lol

I agree she's terrible. I just think she eases some of the hesitations around Biden that most of electorate have in regards to his age, capability, and tenacity.
Kamala Harris's signature moment in the campaign was dunking on Joe Biden. Biden then asks her to be his VP. Say what you want about the decision, but I can't think of anything more Not Trump than that.
I truly think that Biden will pick Susan Rice as his running mate.  She has worked closed to him for 8 years and has all the experience we need right now, in this country and outside this country.
I can't speak to Biden's particulars only that 80% of my clients are over 65 and see these issues nearly every day. I have my worries. But being cruel to the elderly or those suffering age-related  infirmities is still far too common.
If you believe Joe Biden has memory-related issues, then sadness for his plight and worry over the potential consequences for our nation are acceptable responses. Mocking and making light of his perceived cognitive disability is an ugliness that has no place in our discourse.
And the next President of the United States is (insert Biden VP pick here).
Biden-Cone 2020. What a VP pick. History will show this administration was very cool and refreshing.
Apparently Biden does.  But you‚Äôre more ticked off Biden showed he‚Äôs fit, and trump is not
Almost as bad as Biden not finishing a single sentence. Oh wait it‚Äôs not even close.
Nice try, keep swinging.  Just don‚Äôt hurt yourself.  Do you give Biden‚Äôs comments this same scrutiny?  Of course not, surprise, surprise.  Oh, and when was the last time Biden had a real news conference?
Meanwhile in the Biden household
Are you really comparing Ivanka to Hunter Biden?  Absurd!
Thank you!
Old news, Senator Graham is a major supporter of President Trump.  Why didn‚Äôt Obama endorse Biden from the very beginning?
Joe Biden‚Äôs son, Hunter, received special treatment from China.  He is beholden to them.
You are fuckin loopy. You should be Biden's running mate. You two would be the greatest shot show EVER!!
Talk about a complete joke, if your blind you could make these claims, but for the rest of us that watch any Biden video can see it plane as day.
Keep trying, ha, ha.  So are you counting how many times Biden says ‚Äúanyway‚Äù like I asked you to?
#MiaLis79 China would prefer Joe Biden?  Wow
Chins wants stability, and this cycle Biden. They are the current counter to Putin. (Discounting our, you know Allies and Democratic international institutions once revered.)
Bernstien update: Biden biking ably, doing road, roague and riff with ease raises renewed reason concerns about his current most pressing concern: the vote.
You‚Äôve made it clear that you‚Äôre anti Trump, and that‚Äôs it period. You can‚Äôt honestly say that you‚Äôre voting for Biden because of the great accomplishments he‚Äôs had as a 47 year politician. The guys a habitual liar, and has voted against racial equality for decades. Bruh, wtf?
How funny the devil that can‚Äôt quote one verse from the Bible is baring false witness about Joe Biden and his relationship with God. I pray the Lord strikes you down. I hope you return to hell sooner than later. It‚Äôs where you belong. #JesusSaves #ChristiansAgainstTrump #Traitor
Legitimately curious, and would appreciate the LDS perspective on this.  The only reasons out there I‚Äôve gotten back when asking this question point blank on social is Trump is bad, you must vote for Biden or you‚Äôre bad too.  I would love something deeper.  Thx.
good morning, just read the Deseret News article.  I‚Äôm a recently emancipated-from-the-GOP member of the church ... but I‚Äôm not wild about Biden yet.  I‚Äôve read through his site and his positions, but can you please help me see why he deserves my vote?   Not trolling,
Absolutely, President Trump is going to win, he has the momentum.  Joe Biden is slowly slipping away right before our eyes.
Nice try, we all know that it‚Äôs Biden in cognitive decline.  It must be tough to admit.  He‚Äôs a nice guy who should be enjoying his retirement.
Lets not forget Biden's "Poor Kids are just as bright as white kids" quote or his wonderful "7-11/Dunkin Donuts" quote.
You just won‚Äôt face it.  I‚Äôm being totally objective regarding Biden.  Trump is Trump.  He‚Äôs just like when he was elected and he has tremendous stamina compared to Biden, it is obvious to an outside observer.  You are too much of a partisan to admit it to me.
Come on, President Trump is fine regarding his cognitive skills.  Why do you refuse to acknowledge Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline?  Track how many times he says ‚Äúanyway‚Äù and get back to me.
You didn‚Äôt respond to my observation regarding Biden.  It is a sincere apolitical question.
anyone gonna talk about how trump doesn‚Äôt even have a reelection plan? straight up he‚Äôs just like vote for me again ‚Äúmaga‚Äù like you do realize that you didn‚Äôt make America great again the first 4 years right? That‚Äôs embarrassing. Biden is out here with 40 planned out plans
ashamed to be from Utah sometimes. If you think this is right, you love dictatorships! You're a fake patriot who picks and chooses amendments. Are you cool with Biden making life sentences for not wearing masks when he's elected?
Please be objective.  And I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre buddies even if we see things differently. I have a question for you.  Are you at all concerned about Biden‚Äôs decline in his cognitive skills?  He‚Äôs a nice guy, but it concerns me.  I wonder if the Democrats made the right choice.
At this point, Biden could choose Goofy and I'd still vote for him. We'll all be dead or be wishing we were under 4 more years of Trump.
I don‚Äôt use the AP as my news source.  Biden apologized to President Trump for criticizing the President‚Äôs China travel ban.
I don‚Äôt get it! He claims Biden is against religion while at the same time calling Biden deranged for praying?! ü§î
Why? Is it because he's the great Statesman, Joe Biden, or because he's not Trump. Can't fathom the former, so it must be the latter.
Can‚Äôt seem to recall Biden saying he was against God.  My guess is Biden has read more of the Bible than Trump.Biden-Harris 2020 light at the end of the dark tunnel.
Vote for Biden and Harris!
Twitter has added a "manipulated media" warning to this video. Obviously Hannity is intending to talk about Biden here, but it fits #BunkerBoy like a glove, so, uh... it works. Technically also manipulated media. It's both. That is all. #ByeHannity
are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
And Trump can control all his constituents? It's silly to assume a fact, based on a single biased picture. Either way, it's just pandering. I'm sure I could find things that Biden would contradict. None of it is helpful to the American at large..
Biden = Leader. National mask mandate should have been implemented in April.  #BidenHarris2020
I'm unhappy it's never that bad. Even if Biden wins I'll survive. My bank account and equity in my home may take massive hits, but I'll find a way to get through it and have a smile on my face

As a member and a republican this makes me so uncomfortable!! Haha I‚Äôve seen both #LDSforTrump and #LDSforBiden and it makes me cringe. There are great members who will vote for Biden. There are great members who will vote for Trump. It‚Äôs not a church thing üò¨
Biden doesn‚Äôt know or can‚Äôt remember what or who he cares about these days.
I was hoping that she would give me reason to like her and so it would be less painful if biden won, but she hasn‚Äôt given me much.
Vote for Joe Biden is worse than Trump.
Especially you Mr. Biden cuz you would rather sniff them.
It is a caricature now. Anything America like, the Rep says Biden would remove. Meat, apple pie, football, jobs, BBQ, cars, teddy bears, diet soda, grandmas...ANYTHING. Basically it is TRUMP or TOTAL APOCALYPSE.
Yes he does but never held accountable. I hope after Biden-Harris are elected they convict him &amp; all his friends he let out of jail.
I live in Utah, so my ballot for Biden is going in a ballot lock box.

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden‚Äôs Running Mate
Thank you fellow resisters. I appreciate fhe follows. We need to stick together and make sure we put Biden and Harris in office. Otherwise we can kiss our asses goodbye!!! Thanks again.
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
I am patiently awaiting your tweet regarding the way Joe Biden mispronounced his own running mate, I'm wondering if it was intentional by Biden as well?
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
If they get to use this stat, Biden should freely use the current unemployment rate with no asterisk.   I‚Äôm being told that indeed, both wildly misleading stats are being used quite freely. In next week‚Äôs episode of Post-Fact Campaigning....

Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.

The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
#Biden should make a fourth debate contingent on #Trump releasing his #taxes
Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.
There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Biden was just shown in a video riding a bike without a helmet on.   The precedent for his impending accident has been set.
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat

Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Onboard and ready with step one: dump Trump What is step two? Biden is President - how do we have a solid conservative non-Trumpism candidate in four years?
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.
Great combination, her aligning with Biden will ensure Indian-Americans &amp; Afro-American voters.                      Nightmare for opponents !
Sure am! Better dig out the hat and shirts! Would like a new shirt tho maybe with Biden Harris design!
I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES

Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
Baby nut is Biden‚Äôs VP pick
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
Joe Biden and 1995 wants to cut the social security benefits for Americans you got to hear this.

Yeah I think the supremacist and nazi are out in full force supporting trump. I dont see them marching for Biden. Try again.

Yo,  are you one of the traitors working with Russia to get Trump re-elected?
Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
It‚Äôs a great point. And it‚Äôs obviously one that Joe Biden understands well.....wait....

Biden asking Harris to be his VP was so obviously the best decision, I was actually surprised when it happened.
biden did today, in the exact same way
didn't joe biden pronounce it exactly the same way today? um, yeah, he did.
I like how both Biden and Harris refer to their spouses by adding an -y to the ends of their names üòÇ  Joe, Jilly, Kamala, and Dougey.
Y‚Äôall are a little too excited about Biden/Harris for my taste. Remember that we‚Äôre settling for the lesser of two evils. It‚Äôs not a party.
Please don't leave out Obama, Biden, the Clintons, and puppet master Soros from your list of deep-state criminals!  Why don't we just fire all Obama holdovers in government as well as impeach all liberal/socialist federal judges who are proven traitors of the Constitution.
Proof positive that 2 wrongs don't make a right! If they win, which could only be by massive voter fraud, Biden had better get a food taster.
somebody at my work is obsessed with qanon and won‚Äôt stop talking about it after i brought up joe biden once
I thought our dogs were getting them. Are they stealing them from our dogs? Damn! These guys are always a step ahead. We never saw it coming. Like the invisible virus. Some call it COVID-19. I hope they vote for Trump because if Biden is President then we are all going crazy.
You go to war with the army you have. He could have picked so many worse options. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm thinking about the Supreme Court and federal courts when I vote for Biden, and that‚Äôs it! Don‚Äôt be stupid and say ‚ÄúTrump is the same‚Äù because he‚Äôs really not.
Joe Biden has dementia you guys, that would be like electing me to be the President. You know what, if I was the Primary winner, I would get about half the vote too. He can't drive. He got fired from Wendy's. He takes psyche meds. "At least he's not a racist!"
Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and he denied it. Who was right? Who was wrong?
Not the biggest fan of both Kamala and Joe but I look at both campaigns as a bus going in the right direction and the Biden/Harris bus is going to get me a lot closer to my destination than the alternative bus!

Biden's best category is "not being trump." I think that speaks to how Biden doesn't have a specific mandate.   Also speaks to how Trump is not liked in some circles.   Thoughts?

Trump would desperately love to make the media cycle about how desperate the Democrats are because of the new hoax of an impeachment witchhunt. Right now the entire focus needs to be on Biden v Trump. Even a morally correct impeachment would hurt right now. /2
Possibly because it gives Trump yet another vector to distract on. "Oh look, they know they can't win so they're going to try and impeach me again. Witch hunt, hoax, blah blah blah." Nancy wants this to be about Biden and Trump. Not impeaching keeps the focus on the election.
Biden cares
If there are no questions from the press, it is NOT a "press conference." Biden/Harris made a public statement. They did not submit to a press conference.
The difference is that Biden isn't saying anything.
Your going to have a tough road ahead, Joe Biden cannot even finish a complete thought. It‚Äôs sad to watch him. If he was in my family it would break my heart. I say let him enjoy his senior years.
The best part about this statement is that it isn't enough 2 vote for Biden &amp; K, you also cannot criticize them... Holding them accountable is getting off to a GREAT START!

Biden mispronounced it, as well. So have countless others. Why is your outrage targeted at only a single conservative?
You‚Äôre deliberately conflating approval ratings with primary choice (a huge chunk of which was for Biden). This is intellectually dishonest.
when people say they‚Äôre voting for trump because they care about their freedom and they think that Biden is a socialist... its because they‚Äôre afraid of their white cis privilege not mattering as much anymore.

The bigger problem is you treating Trump like an abberation or an abnormality that will simply "go away" eventually. He has done lasting harm in both domestic and foreign policy, and those harms will be amplified if he wins. Biden and Obama suck. Trump is much worse.
Will Joe Biden denounce this, or is he willing to accept anything his supporters do in the name of social justice?

I wouldn‚Äôt say Harris or Biden qualify as middle on police reform.   Trump will argue he has done more for reform then them, and he will have some actual points to make.   They all have invested a lot in our unbalanced justice system.

Biden picking Kamala Harris only makes sense if Biden just gave up and intentionally didn‚Äôt try
Trump is the incumbent. His infidelities are well known and built into his persona. His voters know what they‚Äôre voting for and have made peace with it. Women won‚Äôt move from Trump to Biden for Harris. She is nearly as unliked as Hillary and she‚Äôs proven to be morally bankrupt.
Trump won‚Äôt have to. Willie Brown has admitted that he appointed her to high paying fast-track positions that she wasn‚Äôt qualified for simply because of their relationship. Biden has now alienated a female voter block who despise the image of women moving up from their knees.

OK, I apologize that I misread it.  I am inspired by people coming together to defeat an incompetent, immoral, and divisive president.  Kasich isn't going to talk about his ideas. He's going to make the case for Biden from his perspective; we'll see if it gets votes for Joe.
I don't think that's true.    and  are speaking the same day.  Also, did you read the joint policy recommendations from the Bernie/Biden working group?
Biden promised us a woman
OK yes Biden used the N word. 40 years ago. Why if he's so bad would a black man pick him as VP? And still endorse him now. Biden is the nominee you don't like it. Fine that's your problem. I'm committed in my vote so you are wasting your time and mine.
How is she a hypocrite? She supports Biden. And I take it your not voting. So like not voting STFU. Stay silent. A non vote is a silent voice. Everyone in politics has mud on their shoes if you look close enough.

Still with that shit.  Yes Biden gave support to the war in the beginning. Then he saw where it was really going and changed his mind. What do you care about human life? You support kids in cages at the border. You support suffering in South America and Central America. üñïüèª

Biden means hope.
We can do it after January 2021 when Biden is inaugurated as our new President.
It's almost as difficult to understand as Joe Biden speak.
The GOP wants to give bucketloads of cash to the wealthy who will hoard it. Biden wants to INVEST bucket loads of cash in the public, and when you lift the lowest level, everything above it rises. Biden's investments will return multiple times over the cost, and you KNOW it.
Trump's trillions for the rich don't benefit anyone. Not even really the rich. Biden's benefit hundreds of millions of people. Infrastructure reduces huge costs on everyone SAVING money. Child care and elder care reduce burdens on the health system saving money long run...
Biden means hope.
Nobody is taking Biden signs.

So if Trump can make law and move revenue alone, can‚Äôt Biden by executive order alone cut military 75% and use money for reparations? Think about it conservatives. Presidents should not have this power. Trump unlikely to be president second term.
Put up a Biden sign in yours. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Can‚Äôt wait till Biden uses new presidential authority Trump did stimulus to write his own laws. Declare emergency and take away guns. Cut defense in half and money for reparations. Raise taxes on rich 50% to fund Medicare for all. All by executive order.
So now president‚Äôs alone can write laws and move funding? Biden will love that. Maybe he will sign executive order cutting defense in half and use it to pay reparations? Or raise taxes on rich and fund more welfare, all by executive order. Don‚Äôt sound so good now?
Everyone is like ‚ÄúJoe Biden doesn‚Äôt have dementia. He‚Äôs riding a bike,‚Äù and they quickly look past the fact that he thinks the guy asking the question is Kamala Harris.

BIDEN MEANS HOPE.
It does not matter what the GOP Senate does, 60% of the American voters have already decided to vote for Biden no matter what.  Not a single GOP elected official has mentioned CHILD CARE benefits during a pandemic. Why? Because they do not care about women‚Äôs right to work.

Didn't spell check him, just reporting what he said. ;)  Biden's a shoot a shotgun shell in the air to scare people away kind of guy, as I recall.
Biden just said this past week he'll commit to making AR-15s illegal again. Depending on where people live they have had their guns taken away, or can't carry one. People move and their magazines become illegal when crossing the state line.

I mean it's not that Russia, China, and Iran are secretly manipulating things so Trump and Biden face off (no matter how many big-brained Dems claim otherwise), just that out of those two they have their preferences. This is not as big a story as some think it is IMO.
Presuming the Lincoln Project is rational, both of these sentences are lies. Biden believes in abortion. *Devout* Catholics do not. Trump has never gassed peaceful Americans.

There is no "i"in trump. There is much more integrity, genuine caring, &amp; there is an "i" in BIDEN.
OHIO, U care more about principles THAN even money. Don't you deserve a morally selfless PRESIDENT? A PRESIDENT who will respect ur individual FREEDOMS &amp; UR ECONOMIC prosperity? There is NO "I" in trump. He talks about himself, tweets about himself, etc. There is an "i" in BIDEN.

Thank you fellow resisters. I appreciate fhe follows. We need to stick together and make sure we put Biden and Harris in office. Otherwise we can kiss our asses goodbye!!! Thanks again.
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
I am patiently awaiting your tweet regarding the way Joe Biden mispronounced his own running mate, I'm wondering if it was intentional by Biden as well?
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.

Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.

Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!

Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.
There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.

Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I can't even imagine what they are going through considering his possible debates with Biden. Not too sure they will even happen.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
Sure am! Better dig out the hat and shirts! Would like a new shirt tho maybe with Biden Harris design!
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.

Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.

This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!

Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
Biden is a typical old racist that is amazed that blacks can think. He‚Äôs said Obama was the first smart black. Please someone ask Biden what he would have done better?
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.

It is interesting one Biden commercial counter his other commercial that just showed before it. I find dem ads so twisted with mistruths.
Stuck watching two back to back scripted Biden ads (studio canned edited commercials). Filled with mistruths.  Debates are NOT scripted and allow point and counter points to bring out real positions.  I would settle for a debate a day if they would shut off junk ads.
He has to get elected first and trump‚Äôs approval rating is statutory tick up....Biden needs to announce that you have been selecuas VP so we have some energy and passion in the race. Biden shows no passion and has no energy it is scary.

It's like we're about to see who can fuck with the US more by the outcome of this election. I don't know much about hacking, but if it comes down to Chinese hackers vs. Russian bots; Biden should have this in the bag.
Yeah I think the supremacist and nazi are out in full force supporting trump. I dont see them marching for Biden. Try again.

Yo,  are you one of the traitors working with Russia to get Trump re-elected?
Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
It‚Äôs a great point. And it‚Äôs obviously one that Joe Biden understands well.....wait....
Leave him alone? Give me a break! He is admittedly in it to take votes away from Biden! Hey Kim, as his wife of you want to protect him, have him committed,  otherwise get over your empty pleas!

Just because Biden (and Pelosi) are Catholics, and ‚Äúbelieve in God‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are moral, religious, or even spiritual.  ‚Äú...even the devils believe and tremble...‚Äù  I guess that‚Äôs why my original tweet probably applies to you the most  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

FLASHBACK: Kamala Harris Laughs Off Biden's Rejection Of Gun Control Overreach
This is unfortunately true. Not trump? Not biden? Not harris? Don't care.
I wonder if Biden has a lock of Harris‚Äôs hair in his real mask
Why not forever? Why not a national speed limit of 30?  We'll save thousands of lives. Why not require us to eat 7 servings of vegetables everyday?  We'll save hundreds of thousands of lives!  Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks
So, even if I go outside, by myself, up the canyon?  By myself?  ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÑ
Ever yo about her is fake... her hurt over Biden‚Äôs racism was faked.  She even faked seeking justice as a prosecutor who kept innocent people on death row!!!! SHE IS FAKE!!!!
If #Trump loses, that time between the Election &amp; #Biden‚Äôs Inauguration could be very dangerous for us!
do u think joe biden actually has a chance
Sober up Bobby and make a list of all you can lose under Biden and his 2-faced buddies. Not one coherent thought or stradgety between The Who gang. That‚Äôs not unity that‚Äôs not the United States of America‚Äôs.
I've never seen you criticize Biden's racism. Be consistent.
The next three months are going to be hilarious watching all of the videos of past quotes by Harris and Biden üòÇ
You can bet that if Biden was predicted to slaughter Trump the way Trump is expected to destroy Biden, noone would be calling of the debates.
Weird. Ramses Cat got his ballot from Virginia today. It was even preselected for Biden to make voting easier!
No cause Biden said he would pick a woman!!!
Kamala Harris is the perfect choice. But in reality, I would still vote for Joe Biden even if he selected my granddaughter.
Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching - 'I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it'.  #Biden #accused
Joe Biden: I've chosen Kamala Harris as my running mate.  #Biden #runningmate #KamalaHarris
I doubt she's forgotten anything, including the fact that Biden has learned from past mistakes and perfection is not required before they join forces to defeat Trump.
Biden had a wealth of good choices; he could only pick one. He did well.
So Biden‚Äòs the one who‚Äôs losing his mind, right?
Seriously.  In fact, I‚Äôd bet Biden discriminated against a bunch of eligible candidates that identify as women.
Haha. Biden has lost his marbles and they know it. This is now elder abouse.
And a grand total of zero people are surprised. What happens when Joe Biden resigns from running.
I remember when Harris threw around threats of executive orders on the national debate stage over and over again. She lost any chance at my vote there and then.   Since Biden is essentially just a corpse, voting for Biden means voting for Harris. What a scary thought.
#Trump is lying AGAIN about #Obama &amp; #Biden. And what does #Warren have to do with the #VPPick? He looks ridiculous! #VoteBidenHarris

Lots of excitement around Kamala vs Pence debate. Can you please show the same push to get Biden in the ring with Trump. Now THAT would be a fun round to watch.
She calls Biden a racist then quickly buddies up to him for a shot at President!!!! SELL-OUT!!!!!!!

It's actually hilarious no matter who does it! That was my favorite thing about GHW. Biden is the worst I've seen though and he's definitely not right

Biden was at the Royals game!!
I hate that Biden felt like he needed to apologize. I wish the right didn‚Äôt use faux outrage like the left does. Biden‚Äôs comments were harmless. He shouldn‚Äôt need to apologize.
Here's some humor to start your day off right!  #JoeBidenIsNotWell #SleepyJoeBiden
Sounds like he‚Äôs going the way if Biden. #Dementia
The only reason Biden wins is because enough people are sick of Trump. No one, let me repeat, no one is voting for Biden because they like him or want him to be President. They simply don't want Trump.
#Biden 8/5/2020: "Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly diverse attitudes about different things."  How are people not OUTRAGED by this ridiculous comment!?!
He has much higher than a zero percent chance. I won't vote for him, but I also won't vote for Biden
Nope. Dems aren't smart enough. They put all their best blood up in the primaries. And they've all been doubling down on Biden ever since. Trust me. They don't have a knight in shining white armor.
It‚Äôs perfectly safe to question trumps ‚Äúfaith‚Äù. If someone says ‚Äútwo Corinthians‚Äù or Joe Biden will hurt god and hurt the bible the guy has no idea what any of it means he‚Äôs just regurgitating words
Fake news ... again.  Clinton didn‚Äôt take em, Obama didn‚Äôt take em, Biden isn‚Äôt going to take em. You just keep ‚Äúsaying stuff‚Äù but it has no bearing on reality
And #Biden is a close friend of her family! But her hubby is a Federalist soooo she probably has to see what he advises. Gotta look after herself don‚Äôt ya know.That‚Äôs EXACTLY what the stall is‚ÄîWhen he sees he isn‚Äôt getting elected, the funds will disappear and he‚Äôll blame Biden stating that HE could‚Äôve saved us. Pathetic and infantile brainwork.
Nancy you are so smart and never lose your cool, I think that is why Republicans hate you. Keep it up, Trump is half asleep, slurring his words calling Biden Sleepy Joe, you can see that Trump is desperate
The Biden/Harris ticket is so superior to Trump/Pence. They should not even be in the same election
Which is exactly what Biden said about Universal healthcare so I‚Äôm flummoxed as to your point. Didn‚Äôt your mom ever teach you that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? I‚Äôm about done with your veiled insults. You want to be right. I want to be effective.
USPS, step it up and get it done. be one of the hero's in this   covid season as well as the election. headline "biden/harris win in a landslide-usps delivered all ballots on time."
Exactly! If Bernie were our nominee I sure wouldn‚Äôt be demonizing him right now. This has to work so let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and make some change!
My ex is Australian. I‚Äôm sure it isn‚Äôt perfect but it worked really well for him and his family. My parents are on Medicare and it‚Äôs far from perfect. Surely, the greatest country of all time can come up with something better.
I absolutely agree with this ‚ÄúCorporate influence doesnt belong in the platform or our  healthcare‚Äù but there is an advantage to public/private partnerships. I like Australia‚Äôs healthcare system.
It wasn‚Äôt because of media. People are scared. Stop telling people they are sheep for voting for Biden. There is no way we can go from the far right mess we are in now to a far left agenda and not terrify people. Weüëèüèªüëèüèªhaveüëèüèªüëèüèªtoüëèüèªüëèüèªcomeüëèüèªüëèüèªtogether üëèüèªüëèüèª.
If 90% wanted it then Bernie would have won the nomination.
I hope. In the meantime, a show of solidarity would come a long way in bringing the party together. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean compromising your integrity. We can still hold the moderate dems feet to the fire.
People are creatures of habit. They don‚Äôt understand this can actually be done. Let‚Äôs keep pushing Joe but not lose the majority of the democratic base by scaring them. Let‚Äôs show them how even differences won‚Äôt come between us and that we are committed to change.
And encouraging him to continue that progress into the presidency. And then showing the party that we are going to come together to make real change in this country?  It‚Äôs a missed opportunity just to posture.
This is the point. We all need to come together. Joe wasn‚Äôt my pick. But politics are designed to demonize the opponent. We have to come together. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if Ro had thanked Joe for being willing to come to the table with Bernie to move the platform forward....
And clearly I‚Äôm too fired up to type - ‚Äúhactially‚Äù???
This doesn‚Äôt do that. It doesn‚Äôt incentivize Joe. Sitting down and coming up with the best plan to move the country that direction does. I want universal health care. I work in public health. I lost my 39 year old brother to cancer last year. He had no insurance which delayed tx
Joe is a good person and hactially has a verifiable history of implementing policy change. We don‚Äôt come together by purity bashing.
Biden could run on a platform to dismantle the USPS and Democrats would fall in line and try to justify it just because he isn't Trump.  Change my mind.
Which Biden has adopted much of.... so what is the purpose of this? Nothing except to showboat. It doesn‚Äôt change one thing except give the GOP talking points about infighting.
Perhaps he should listen to his idol. Huh? Talk about insufferable.
I remember you calling someone a "petulant child" because they indicated they won't be voting for Biden.  Pot, meet kettle.
Why should I talk about Trump if we both know how bad he is?  You seem to be stuck under the illusion that Biden is not also a White supremacist corporte extremist. He already promised nothing will fundamentally change and that he will go after "anarchists."
Okay. So the words and actions of the DNC are lockstep with the GOP, and Biden is a right-wing corporate extremist. And you are just gunna go along with it and tell the rest of us to lick the boot with you.  No. Thanks.
While ignoring, entirely, that Biden will perpetuate the Oligarchy and trying to sell him as the most progressive candidate in history (hahahahaha no)  Maybe try being honest.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.

Hearing he is going to prosecute Former President Obama and Former Vice President Biden and Obama for treason for spying on him...
If Biden gets to control his presidency, then it may not go too far left.  I'm not sure how much control he will have
I think if Biden is President like he was a Senator, he will be left/center one.  I don't know if that's the case.  Harris was the 4th most liberal Senator with her voting record. So if she's moderate for the party...then that says something too.
She's even got the "centrist" Biden saying planes will be off fossil fuels in 5 years.  (Incidentially, I think they have the technology to do this already, because they know they have to do it eventually...probably actually not the worst thing in the world)
Even though she's the one setting the party agenda (seriously), the party doesn't want her as visible to the public.  They are framing Biden/Harris as "moderate", when the definition of moderate for progressives seems to mean anything right of Bernie Sanders.
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
Friendly reminder that Biden‚Äôs entire reason for opposing #M4A is literally ‚Äúmy family is rich and we still faced hardship so fuck the poors‚Äù
No, but I'd wait 8 hours in line to keep Biden out.
No. There are plenty of reasons Harris and Biden are awful without resorting to this shit.
Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Well, maybe if you manned up and stayed in the running things could have been different. No one wants Joe Biden.
Let‚Äôs put it this way, I see about 8 or 9 KAG, MAGA and Gadsden flags before I even leave my neighborhood every morning. I‚Äôve seen a grand total of one Biden sign and one Biden bumper sticker in the whole county.
That‚Äôs silly that‚Äôs Joe Biden and his bladder control issue.
Dude voting for Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt about fixing every problem the Trump administration caused. It‚Äôs literally about getting them out of office. That‚Äôs the FIRST step and the ONLY way we can even BEGIN to clean this gd mess up.
I am hoping that he gets beaten so bad that he cant claim he actually won probably about 75% of the vote going to Biden

Absolutely! If anything, the blame is on the DNC for splitting the left vote. Most of the left was NEVER going to vote Biden or Harris, regardless. Bernie was the compromise for many on the left.
Ok never mind, i figured it out.... But dont get your hopes up, it will never happen. Mondale chose Ferraro, McCain chose Palin and Clinton ran as a female candidate against Trump and that failed. So I highly doubt that Biden will win. Trump will be a 2 time President.
imma bring this back bc y‚Äôall workin my nerves lol just bc Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt our first choice doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt vote?! Lmao y‚Äôall the same ppl that failed 16yr old me 4yrs ago by writing in harambe .

Kamala Harris prosecuted over 1,500 people for possessing marijuana as attorney general in California. She also seems to have flip flopped on her previous accusations of Biden being racist. She is running with the man who supported the 1994 crime bill...
The dichotomy between leftists and liberals in my circle on the Biden pick is stark:   Liberals: I love this ticket! Let's beat Trump!   Leftists: Hahahahahahahaha
It really makes very little difference. Trump and Pence are ogres. Biden and Harris will smile nicely as they fuck you over. They're all cut from the same cloth, and none of them will be running the country anyway.
That's of little comfort to the millions Biden and the cop will continue to fuck over.
Biden/Harris....I think it's a win..
I think this VP pick hurts Biden quite a bit.  Not enough to lose the election, but he had better options.

I am offended: Trump thinks that men are upset because Joe Biden is selecting a woman, for Vice President. there are many good men that joe could have picked but the women on the list are all more qualified than them. I think all women should be upset about this

Politics and culture in this era: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and The Making of the President 1972:

If the GOP was running practically ANYONE else I‚Äôd be all in. Romney, Rubio, heck, even Pence would be fine, because it‚Äôs just unimaginable to me that anyone would think Biden would be a great President. Sorry.
Whooooo! Biden-Imminent 2020!
I will vote for  Biden. PERIOD!!

If Biden wins, they will make it law.
If Biden wins, Congress will make it a tax cut. If he doesn't, they won't
No Wrist Corsages, Please
Jerry Falwell Jr., Newt Gingrich, Donald J. Trump-adulterous men. Fierce believers in the Bible, all pretend they love God. Joe Biden first wife died in a a car crash, still married to his 2nd wife goes to church regularly, really loves God-what kind of God would not favor Biden?
Because Biden wants to do push ups, his mind is not right
Do you think making up this list is going to divert the attention of, anybody who has at least a 5th grade education, away from the fact that Joe Biden has dementia? Pop the bubble!
I Agree. Mr Biden is a deeply religious family man. He is a community supporter and a patriotic individual.
üòéüëç I will fight for you either way
I will go where I want.  Voter shaming a leftist-independent is not how you won voters for  or the  A candidate earns my vote through their policy and their character.  is a disgusting, creepy racist whose policy has slowed progress for decades.
I was never going to vote Biden lol  Go phone bank some Republicans, you'll have better luck there.
Joe Biden has the Democratic Party behind him, a lot of Republicans would vote for a crazy person before they would vote for a Democratic candidate
This whole Kanye thing is dumb. Yes things are taken out of context for obvious reasons, but people close to the trump campaign are doing everything possible to split votes to have Biden lose out on votes. Does that not make sense to any of you?
Honestly most of the stuff Biden says confuses me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hmm...hurt God? Mister 2 Corinthians?
Instagram also had a "glitch" where negative Trump posts wouldn't show up in Trump hashtag searches but negative Biden hashtags produced negative Biden posts....or more to the point, you've done more TO women and none of it good, you dirty old man. Get out of DC! Vote Biden and Harris!
And not to forget Tony Blinken, whose ‚ÄòWestExec Advisors‚Äô help companies to get access in China. Take a look at the companies these advisers are associated with and you can get a sense of what kind of China policy they will run
Here is Jake Sullivan, a key Biden Foreign policy adviser, listen to him and compare to Trumps team on China
I don‚Äôt think she will be in charge of foreign policy anyway,  it will be driven by Joe Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisers, the same ones that advised him when he was Vice-President with Ukraine/China portfolio.
are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
People that hate Biden like to claim he's just like Trump which is bullshit. Biden will never seize mail boxes to prevent you from exercising your right to vote, he will never question your Americanness. It's so annoying that people don't understand the stakes smh
Literally someone had a Biden 2020 sign in their porch today and I wanted to throw up.
Biden &amp; Harris are going to restore justice. Tick Tock, Matt.
This is all I need to know.  Trump hats are made in China.  Biden hats are made by Union Members in the USA.
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake  The endorsement comes after the president's resistance to Postal Service funding, amid his fight against expanded mail-in voting.
Get excited about Biden.
Biden didnt say any of that. Wow
So why you voting for Biden?
It's a good question.   Why does Joe Biden want to see his own kind "cleansed?"
Kind of with Biden on this...
Just like how Obama was coming for the guns. Biden‚Äôs is coming for religion.?   Any religion that‚Äôs ok with a man who grabs women by the pussy must have been created by a charlatan even pedophile.
But you're not sure if you vote for Biden against the man who spits on your fathers grave. Great daughter you are
You should vote for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man and will serve us well. #BidenHarris2020
Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
List all the great things about Biden and Harris
Do you think Joe Biden even realizes he‚Äôs running for president or so his handlers have to remind him daily or hourly?
I‚Äôm LDS and Voted trump in 2016 And his handeling of pandemic and his constant shots at low income housing and how it‚Äôs ruined suburbia. And his racist ways I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris
The democratic ticket has to be a joke.  No way are they running with a Biden/Harris ticket.  I am calling their bluff!
I'm to the point of just removing people from my life who tell me Trans Lives aren't enoigh of a reason to vote for Biden/Harris.  My life is all I have. Its plenty of enough reason.
"Trevor Noah Can‚Äôt Tell Whether Trump Is Attacking or Defending Biden" by Trish Bendix via NYT
LET ME EDIT THAT HEADLINE!  Trump clashes with Biden over whether Covid-19 is real or fake news. (Biden insists it's real, backed by scientist/ Trump cites witchdoctors and Qanon cultists that it's not.)  There, fixed it for you üòâ
uhh joe biden
There are no credible facts that Joe Biden is a pedophile.  This is another conspiracy theory. Don't fall for it.
News flash, Spanky, the world already is laughing at us. Well, they‚Äôre laughing at you, but as the supposed leader of this nation, the mocking of you is the same as laughing at us. If anything, a Biden administration will help America regain its standing in the world.
üé∂ Biden can‚Äôt run his own life, I‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôll run mine üé∂
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.
I respect that wholeheartedly. I honestly think Biden will step down if he was to win they needed a familiar name to run &amp; him being Obama‚Äôs VP it only made sense that they would choose him
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
He just said he can deliver a speech ‚Äúviral, as they say‚Äù but Biden is the sleepy one lmao
Here's a radical left agenda for you: vote Biden/Harris, and get rid of the no-mind buffoon.  He can go build a hotel &amp; live in the drug den Philippines where another buffoon likes to threaten the press.  They can take the Russian vaccine together, &amp; live happily ever after!
.....Joe Biden actually wrote the crime bill that allowed mandatory minimums &amp; the 3 strikes rule. He even said out of his own mouth that, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about the conditions that created them all I want is these super predators odd the street‚Äù
Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
I‚Äôm positive that 94‚Äô crime bill . wrote has done more harm to the black community than any conspiracy especially when u take into account Biden worked with segregationists to lock up minorities with tough on crime policies and mandatory minimum legislation
Krystal at this point is a grifter. She has nothing new to offer expect "Biden bad". Her job is to constantly feed her audience the same steady diet that fuels their anger and disgust in the primary outcome while giving ammunition to Trump sympathizers to use against Biden.
I'm kind of surprised that the Republicans' attempt at Othering yet another black opponent is not reportable as an in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
We all know how those debates would go...Trump would eviscerate Biden lol
I said this months ago and I'll say it again...this man is going to ANNIHILATE Biden in a debate lmao
Hey, asshole, it isn't getting better! Nobody has even a marginal grasp on this virus except the scientists. Stop lying to us, bastard! You SUCK! Vote Biden/Harris!  Trump turns toward a third season of coronavirus with a tale of success
However when Joe Biden introduced her as his running mate and mispronounced Kamala he gets a pass! Tucker was following Joe's lead, but typical liberals only report what they want to hear.
Tell us now if Biden plans to raise Americans taxes? I don't know how it works in Canada, but I'm paying enough already without supporting the D's socialistic policy proposals for America.
Tell us what Biden/Harris plan for America? How much more in taxes are you ready to pay for the GND? Slavery reparations? Yes, they support these.
Tell us how Biden/Harris are going to help?
Well I'm hopping china blocks Russia out and helps joe Biden win win win because I still really think trump start this virus thinking it would save him to stay president then it got out of control and he and his family did not know how to stop it that's why he does not want to
If anything like this ever reaches  verification , Joe Biden will be looking for a new VP pick.
That's what Joe Biden has said. Is there anyone out there who thinks that they're taxed too little?
I told you Joe Biden is the modern day Harry Anslinger he has been since the 80s when he introduced Billie Holliday type legislation tough on addicts and the pushers just like Anslingers racist crusade but this time all minorities where Billie Holliday and whites got a taste too
I swear 2020 is worst than 2016 in the "2 party voting system, evil scale style":  Evil scale '16: Hillary 100 to Trump 50 (Trump was evil on words, Hillary was plain evil)  Evil scale '20: Biden 100 to Trump 100 (both equally evil on action and words, non-words for Biden üëÄ)
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs candidacy will be nuts‚Äù says man who died two weeks ago lmao
I'll admit, still better than Trump in the GOP. But like I've said over and over and over and over and over again, it's like having to choose between herpes and full-blown AIDS. Trump and GOP = full-blown aids. Biden/Harris is like herpes, manageable
How about this for a Biden/Harris campaign slogan - "we want to bring back the status quo, we must maintain the status quo, for the greater good"
If they get to use this stat, Biden should freely use the current unemployment rate with no asterisk.   I‚Äôm being told that indeed, both wildly misleading stats are being used quite freely. In next week‚Äôs episode of Post-Fact Campaigning....
The things we have learned from the past whether it's #Democrats or #Republicans #Congress or #BJP, both are enemies of Islam while Trump may be visible and Joe Biden invisible or Amit Shah as Visible and Rahul Gandhi as invisible.  History has proved that.

Sickening at the very least. Please let Kamala know .. Biden is sleeping

Isn't that what Joe Biden is doing now as well?
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
This is literally the message. Not Hillarys emails or Baracks birth place or Kamalas heritage. COVID 19 AND THE ECONOMY. Biden/Harris need to hammer away at this every waking hour

My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.
Biden should win.  Trump's chance of winning is not frivolous.

The Fred election model says:  Biden is materially ahead right now. Biden would be very likely to win if the election were today. There are three months till the election and a lot can change. Trump can still win. This year is crazy.
Was Biden a threat to his standing Arkansas or something?
Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat
Psychopathic Sadist??? Look, being hyperbolic to the point of utter stupidity is a symptom of TDS. OBiden had the House, Senate, and presidency and gave us shit Obamacare. 50,000 people a year die because they have no healthcare. So yeah, go vote for Biden
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....
What‚Äôs remarkable is . actually wrote a Crime Bill that resulted in mass incarceration in the black community üíØüíØüíØ Biden worked closely with his racist colleagues to push crime policy toward mandatory minimum sentences and other ‚Äúget tough‚Äù positions
But did you also know that Joe Biden's ancestors owned slaves? Sauce üëá
tRump isn't simply "an asshole". He's a stoopid SOB whose incapable of managing a pandemic, killing 150,000+ Americans.  Unemployment at historic levels yet somehow Barry &amp; Biden's "socialism" has gotten you into a lather.  WHAT has tRump accomplished in 3 years besides this‚òùÔ∏è?

The choices are clear Trump/Pence or Biden/Harris. You can either choose to cry on the sidelines because you didn't get your perfect birthday present or choose a side. If you decide not to participate, you cant complain about the what happens in the next 4 years.
I love Biden's ability to stay on topic and not get sucked into culture wars and mundane debates about Kamala's racial heritage.
So you are already handicapping Biden's demise? What???!! Why didn't Democrats just choose Harris at the beginning?
You can stand by you decision and not vote for Biden but know this: Your big system-wide change may never occur and the things you want to see may have to come in steps. You can be making a difference now instead of waiting for the the climate to be right.

I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think it's become clear that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to appease our Neighbors To The North and secure the illegal Canadian vote.  I'm looking forward to Bill Barr opening up an investigation on Canadian collusion &amp; interference in this election.
3. Joe Biden's handlers' strategy still going strong, right  Cancel those debates!
2. Joe Biden's racism is baked into the cake. Y'all can stop wasting your breath on it.
Thread  1. How about a thread of tweets that have aged well?  Joe Biden's racism won't hurt him. ‚úÖ
Biden is a Dem
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
If we know one thing about Biden, he'll definitely get behind her üòÆ
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

My political prediction is this: if Biden and Harris win, in four years from now, 30% of the country will still be mispronouncing her first name.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris: "It's not fair to hold us accountable for the 'sins' of our ancestors."  Also Joe &amp; Kamala: "We think all current Americans should be held accountable for the sins of our ancestors."
The Joe Biden twist might be for some, though.
Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.

Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he ran with a can of applesauce, but ok.
"Harris said that she would pass the Equality Act on her first day in the White House.  She also vowed to end the epidemic of violence against trans women of colour, saying there must be ‚Äúserious consequence and accountability‚Äù."
Yeah, but I am wondering how that's going to work out. I would love to see that. Wondering if any Dems will get in the door in a supposed red state. Can't imagine supporting anyone but Biden and Harris! Finally, a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel!
Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.
biden really said, ‚Äúwhat will make everyone hate me more and encourage voter suppression,,,, it can‚Äôt get any worse!‚Äù god i‚Äôm so mad i have to vote for him and a COP A LITERAL COP !!!
Tulsi is such a beautiful, intelligent woman. Why did we, the actual left, get screwed all over again with Biden/Harris when we had incredible candidates like Tulsi, Bernie, and Andrew Yang.
It‚Äôs Biden/Harris or authoritarianism. One step at a time.
Harris isn't perfect, neither is Biden but they come close enough for me. If Republicans and Evangelicals can look past Trump grabbing woman by the pussy then yall should be good on this
This is why Biden picked her. Trump can't figure out how to attack this ticket at all. You can't call Biden anti police with an Attorney General on the ticket
Biden didnt pull a John McCain and pick Sarah Palin, Kamala Harris is ACTUALLY qualified. Even if Biden didn't commit to picking a woman VP, she was the best choice out of everyone that ran this cycle for the VP slot.
If Bernie Sanders supporters were the base, Bernie wouldve won the nomination. Black women are the democratic base, Biden would have been crazy to not pick a black woman in acknowledgement of that. As a man with sisters who I want to see do well, this is a great day.
Imagine being a black man not voting for Biden because he picked a black woman with a white husband. Childish irrelevant mufuckas

My reaction when Biden announced  as his VP: HERcules! HERcules! HERcules! #BidenHarris2020
Biden could pick a table lamp as his running mate at this point and I would vote for him just to get the orange buffoon out of office.#Biden2020

This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
Yes it is an exciting moment when Kamala‚Äôs appetite for political gain is greater than her belief in his sexual accusers and her anger towards Biden for supporting segregation... and the list goes on. Really good for Americaü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden is a tank with low aggro and Trump the damage dealer can't concentrate on a target.
Hahahaha... you're scared silly... which is saying something since you're always running scared. Vote Biden and Harris! Down with tyranny! Get rid of the lemmings and toss the lying Traitor Trump into prison and forget about him. He deserves a cold, dank cell with no privalges!
The Biden camp played this shit perfect
Biden once again ignores the Extremely Online on both sides and does the safe, normie thing.

Kamala came through and saved Biden like how anime characters come in at the last second and block the killing blow. Talking bout "Sorry I'm late....hehe"
Joe Biden and Kamala are the radical left ? Lol
I wonder if they are worried that the accusation Biden is just a socialist Trojan horse has more weight than they want to fight. So they chose a more moderate woman of color.
She will certainly help Biden carry California if he can remember where that is.
Bro you either on board or you not at this point. Go vote Trump since you got a problem with Everything Biden does.
She literally called Biden a racist in the initial debates. So her hunger for political gain erases that now?
I hope the Khive is ready. Biden will need y'all
~Donald Trump doing everything in his power to lose the 2020 election~  Joe Biden: "Hold my beer."  Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his VP.  WE ARE SO SCREWED
Does Biden feel bad that she called him a racist in the initial debates...or is that not matter now?My father in law said that if Biden gets in they will take all of our private land.
...or more to the point, you've done more TO women and none of it good, you dirty old man. Get out of DC! Vote Biden and Harris!
Why is Xi standing next to trump when he wants Biden? Are you really that slow?
Uknow voting fraud system is set2roll....the postal union endorses Biden....postal workers have access to the ballots....good enough to remove ballot access from USPS....a clear conflict of interest...saying postal workers I've talked to are vehemently anti-trump not vilification
we know police are very pro-Trump.....I'm sure from my interaction with postal workers you will find they support anti-Trump or Biden just as much......it doesn't take a majority to do voter fraud....pro-Biden have dominance and access...needs to be taken out of hands of USPS
A) I don't think VP sways votes anyway and B) I don't think there was anyone Biden could pick that would sway a 2020 Trump voter
will Trump debate himself when Biden refuses to show?
Biden isn‚Äôt even good enough for his own hashtag. You have to put Harris on there, he has already lost. ü§£ü§£ü§£
wonderful...yet we hear the postal workers endorsed Biden...those thru whose hand the ballots are allowed to flow...now that's some conflict...very dangerous
There is not one Democrat I know of (correct if I am wrong) that if for any restrictions on abortion.  Which includes biden and Harris of course. The open encouragement of abortion as birth control bothers me even past a religious aspect cause let‚Äôs be real I am bad Mormon
You have made one choice you regret. I regret voting 3rd party last time. It was a waste of my voice. Try option 3, vote Biden-Harris, and see if actual Republicans become a thing again under Biden. They won't under Trump. Check out  ,  ,
Absolutely not. I never voted for Trump before. I don‚Äôt think I will this time. I want to vote for Biden but abortion is a topic that sways me yes.
How do you rationalize abortion when voting for Biden?
#VoteOutRacism by voting in Crime Bill Biden and the cop? Good luck with that!
For LDS people who support Biden, I genuinely and in the most sincere way want to know how your rationalize the abortion issue?  Pls no hate tweets or disagreements. State your case and I will stay out of it unless asked a question
How can you possibly call out Biden on Tara Reade without acknowledging these women?
If you go to his website he has policy proposals bur I have no idea if he is serious about implementing them.  Like Bernie I knew was passionate about Healthcare, Julian Immigration, Elizabeth Wallstreet reform, Tulsi Foreign policy. Biden no idea.
This is funny. I could absolutely see Biden asking this question when reading about #trumpGoldenShower lmao
Reasons why I should actually vote for Joe Biden when he is less than 1% likely to win UT and also I want to bolster third parties READY GO
I have never suggested  Biden is not flawed. He wasn‚Äôt my 1st or 2nd choice. But in our system it is him or Trump and, though imperfect, he is orders of magnitutude better than Trump.
And I'll vote by mail, as I've been doing in Utah for well over a decade, for Biden/Harris, and will know my vote will be counted and not changed because of the plethora of evidence that shows that doesn't actually happen.
It‚Äôs the WORST lol. Like, yeah karen I get it you *really* want me to vote for Biden, but I have a candidate this time that I actually agree with and like, so I find it more important I vote who I want to support lol.

are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
I tried to keep my mouth shut around my more centrist elders re: the election but they kept hounding me. So I told them straight. that I don‚Äôt think biden will win. When I tell you they would rather blame me if that happens rather than idk...a white supremacist government...üòë

I am so glad to see this. Is Obama even able to be his biden‚Äô lol wouldn‚Äôt that be amazing
Yeap unfortunately. I don't remember the last time our country was in such desolate and separatist state. I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, but I think that a Biden presidency will worsen the crime rates, homelessness, and lawlessness in general.
If this was a voter suppression conspiracy, why would they be warning people of a potential problem?  It also assumes that the mail-in votes will favor Biden.  What is the evidence?  Mailed ballots were already a problem in the primaries.  I smell a hoax.
I know the definition. That's my point. It still doesn't say "Biden is a tyrant". It says a cruel, oppressive ruler is a tyrant. It's very generalized and subjective. So if someone thought Trump was cruel and oppressive, then he is by definition a tyrant.
What‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs favorite cum town bit?
Has Biden or Obama done anything like this?
It was only political in pointing out the problem with the term "tyrant" because anyone can use that to justify their crime.   "I don't like Trump, he's a tyrant." Or "I don't like Biden, he's a tyrant."   What constitutes a tyrant that gives someone the right to then shoot them?

If you want me to fight for you, things have to get a little better. They won‚Äôt be all the way better by a long shot. But still. I know that we can‚Äôt trust this ticket to solve real, huge problems. Biden and Harris leave a LOT to be desired.

I‚Äôm black and I‚Äôm just wondering what the fuck the alternatives are? Like I despise the fact that our only options are senile biden and fascist trump but what tf else can we do to get an ideal outcome from this? Not vote? That never works
My biggest issue with the movement. I supported him because at least he was proposing progressive bills with Kamala and Markey. I‚Äôll vote for Biden to fight facism and harm reduction. But I also have faith in Kamala‚Äôs senate record to move Biden left. We aren‚Äôt all that naive.
I‚Äôm pragmatically voting for Biden-Harris for many reasons, but would really have preferred voting for someone without questions about their conduct toward women. You should be free to voice your valid concerns about him. Protecting freedom of speech is one reason he has my vote.
Biden isn‚Äôt proposing universal healthcare either. That‚Äôs the issue. The public option will still leave millions uninsured

Hi Wizard! Just followed you! I am in Utah trying to fight the good fight. Thank you for being a resistor and a champion for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Americans! I am fighting with the democrats and resistors in this state.
So pretty much a symbolic vote all the way. I don‚Äôt really want Biden to win, but I really don‚Äôt want Trump to continue wagging the dog.
So why you voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm from Utah, and as someone who usually votes Republican, I‚Äôm voting for Biden for a couple of reasons:  (1) My vote will have little effect on the electorate. Utah will go red.  (2) Id like to send a message to the GOP to abandon Trumpism and fix some serious party flaws.

Obama and Biden couldn't even conceive a policy that would do so ... by their own admission we were in a new permanent state of decline that was to be managed.
Republicans make want to throw up. Unbelievable. and no I'm not voting for Biden or Trump. Republicans just makes me cringe.
Vote for Biden. Pass it on.

Everyone claiming that voting for Biden is the same as voting for Trump should vote for Biden just to prove to the rest of us that they are correct.

Right...I feel what the president has accomplished just in the past few weeks Is scaring the holy crap Ola out of the Democrats they should be ashamed of how they‚Äôre handling this campaign and using Biden as a stick puppet is frightening as well and Kamala boy she is nasty ‚ÄºÔ∏è

If Biden only receives votes from the people that are crazy about him, Trump wins in a landslide.  If Biden receives votes from everyone that‚Äôs determined that Trump is a danger to democracy, Biden wins in a landslide. And that is what is needed.
This claim of a "Trump Bump" is nonsense. Strong economy was built from 2011 to 2017, trump maintained for  few years then ran the ship aground. Biden will have to clean up his mess.
Difference, Biden's were dropped. Not enough credible evidence. Trump's were settled, with children no less.
Oh sweets,  how vacant your mind must be to surpport Biden.    Been in Goverment for 48 years and his only accomplishment is enriching his family.  Don‚Äôt even get me started on Harris.
Ignore this. Pretend it‚Äôs Biden/Harris at 34%. The US can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of this guy.
In such a time where violence towards Americans is decried, looking at the record of Harris &amp; Biden, one should be appalled. Harris keeping innocent people in prison &amp; other crimes should be shown on corporate media, yet its not. Government should NOT be allowed to commit crimes.
Also weird to think Biden/Harris wouldn't be anti-sex trafficking, since Harris practically wrote the book on fighting sex trafficking.
Also a weird flex to call the guy who started his term with a Muslim ban, &amp; apparently gave his approval to Pres Xi to go ahead with his Uighur Muslim concentration camps, as being for religious freedom. And Biden, who is a faithful Catholic and regularly attends, isn't pro-God?
I definitely follow politics.  I‚Äôm just not brainwashed and deluded.  But since you seem to think Biden Who is deeply religious is anti religion you must not follow politics very closely.
If there was anyone but Donald on their ticket they‚Äôd be attacking Biden/Harris with razor blade precision.
Don't expect any media coverage for this, but the lady who is running against Biden/Trump 2020 posted this:
The church isn't supposed to endorse politicians, so in a way, yes. That's part of my problem with this misappropriation.  Also, an independent evaluation has found Obama/Biden WH told 18 verifiable lies in their 8 years. Trump has told +20,000 so far in his 3.5 yrs.
Listen to the words coming out of Biden's mouth...,
Yep. Also it's a weird flex to say Trump, the dude who had at least 8 extramarital pregnancies ended with abortions, is "the most pro-life." When Biden/Obama literally oversaw one of the greatest declines in abortion rates in 30 years because they made birth control available.
People who live in a swing state/more competitive state should absolutely vote Biden. But I don't think we should urge people to vote blue no matter what in non-competitive states.
The problem is I don't see how we ever break the cycle. Say Biden wins on fear of Trump. The next election, the party and voters become complacent, some other right-wing nutbag wins a surprise victory, and we're right back where we started.
By reminding us of the fact that just a couple of months ago she mentioned that she believed Tara Reade‚Äôs allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. That will get the media off of the story that I called  a segregation sympathizing racist.

Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in voting. For Democrats, Trump‚Äôs new remarks were a clear admission that the president is attempting to restrict voting rights. Biden said it was ‚ÄúPure Trump. He doesn‚Äôt want an election.‚Äù Trump=dictator!
See Biden as a "bridge" to a better future.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in votes, including the false claim that Democrats are seeking universal mail-in voting, specifically to gain an advantage in his November matchup against Joe Biden. EVIL MAN AND WANNABE DICTATOR!

I would offer this counterpoint. The fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is the DNC ticket is a far cry from accepting anarchists overtaking city blocks into the fold.
My issue is with understanding what their goal is. I've gotten a couple people to talk to me about it. It seems that for a lot of people, Biden having been accused of rape is a bridge too far. Harris' record with trans rights and hanging with CBP and ICE in general has them cold.

Kamala should get more credit from progressives. She supports a plan very close to Medicare 4 all and the green new deal. She has a very liberal record in the senate specifically. Biden could have done much worse. Harris is a big win for me üëç
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
The way I see it is progressives can protest and get mad and try to push the party farther left after Biden/Harris are elected. Priority over anything else right now has to be getting Trump and Republicans out of the White House. Nothing else matters if that doesnt happen.

Even people like  whose US citizenship was questioned because he opposes Biden/Harris as do I. They went with hes a Russian troll, even Canadian lol. The desperation.
The Krazy part is, my dad is a biden supporter and I say shit like 'I want candidates who support Medicare for all' and he says 'so do i' then we get in a fight about how corporate dems want to feed their donors all of the resources americans work for and he tells me vote trump
This is exactly why we need to take the 30% of dem voters and start a party, Biden supporters see people like John Kasich and mitt Romney as stronger allies than AOC and Rashida talib

I just don‚Äôt understand this pick. The left have so many wonderful representatives, that could have offset Biden‚Äôs flaws, and they went with the worst possible pick. I don‚Äôt get it

Nobody to the left of Lamar Alexander thinks Joe Biden or Kamala Harris are actually "progressive" let alone a full-blown Bernie leftist.

It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
We're sucking screwed! At least until Biden/Harris wins!!
To me, voting for Biden is just a way to stem the bloodflow while we keep working for *actual* reformation to the system. Trump will negatively impact democracy and free speech (and freedom generally) a lot more than Biden, making the work even more difficult.

Trump would desperately love to make the media cycle about how desperate the Democrats are because of the new hoax of an impeachment witchhunt. Right now the entire focus needs to be on Biden v Trump. Even a morally correct impeachment would hurt right now. /2
Possibly because it gives Trump yet another vector to distract on. "Oh look, they know they can't win so they're going to try and impeach me again. Witch hunt, hoax, blah blah blah." Nancy wants this to be about Biden and Trump. Not impeaching keeps the focus on the election.
Biden cares
If there are no questions from the press, it is NOT a "press conference." Biden/Harris made a public statement. They did not submit to a press conference.
The difference is that Biden isn't saying anything.

Will Kamala Harris make a full commitment to running as Joe Biden's VP and resign her Senate seat as proof of her seriousness, or muh?

You are absolutely wrong Liz. And I for one will do everything I can to help elect her and Biden. It's time this American Nightmare Ends! Our Democracy can't take 4 more years of Trump and his Co Conspirators üò†
Trump Is Very, Very Nasty ‚ÄºÔ∏èüò†
Um other than Kennedy and Biden who else was a Catholic on the ticket? ü§î
Biden and Obama are part of the establishment, but they're better than Trump. But "the establishment" is as a whole worse than Trump how exactly? Because they promote capitalism and imperialism? Trump does too, but he's not "establishment?"
Are Biden and Obama establishment?
The bigger problem is you treating Trump like an abberation or an abnormality that will simply "go away" eventually. He has done lasting harm in both domestic and foreign policy, and those harms will be amplified if he wins. Biden and Obama suck. Trump is much worse.
Will Joe Biden denounce this, or is he willing to accept anything his supporters do in the name of social justice?
lmao at Biden supporters who think that bullying people into supporting their candidate will make leftist voters want to support him if he wants the vote from the left, he needs to earn the vote from the left; simply not being trump isn‚Äôt enough
Just a heads up, Biden has said he will veto Medicare for All if it passes. This is one of the main reasons why I have major issues with him as the nominee
How is it that any level headed, reasonable thinking person would want to vote for Biden/Harris &amp; bring us to the brink of Socialism. Socialism is evil. Think about it people. Do you want Socialism? Look at what the Dems platform is. What do they support?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see this election as being about choosing a candidate who will be able to lead us in the right direction. It will be about choosing a candidate who can be most effectively pressured into allowing more space for the evolving anti-racist movement.‚Äù
This is what CLASS, HARD WORK, &amp; GENUINE LOVE FOR "THE PEOPLE" LOOKS LIKE!!! Biden/Harris for AMERICA
If Biden wins it's a near 100% chance
A President does not need a pleaser as his VP.  Does Pence have the character to contradict Trump? He is a like a submissive wife according to Trump.  Kamala was selected because Joe Biden needs a VP like Kamala who is going to express a disagreement without fear of retaliation!

Tulsi is friends with dictators &amp; has some weird beliefs. She doesn't "play the game" because she doesn't know-how.  I don't think Harris was rough with Biden during the primary and flipped flopped. Obviously, they disagree on details but they can still work together.

With this choice, Biden has ensured not a single conservative will relinquish their vote, &amp; we really needed the Dems to reach across party lines to secure Trump‚Äôs deposal. But she‚Äôs also pissed off enough Dems with her prosecution history. This is just bad. This is a bad play.
Everyone knows this election will be Biden‚Äôs VP vs Trump. He had a chance to add fire to a bland campaign and some electability to his otherwise weak bid for office. He added fire, I‚Äôll give him that‚Äîbut Harris is far too controversial to be electable.
I mean, I was already going to vote Biden. But now I'm 1,000 percent on board. I love  She's going to be an excellent vice president!
For all the user people out there. If your not voting. Not actively involved in making changes. Sitting around complaining because you can. Please just stop. You get what you get because YOU won't make a stand.  I don't agree on everything Biden.  Still voting #BidenHarris2020

Biden has more baggage than Harris. Legit racial baggage from earlier in his time in the Senate and serious financial baggage from his time as VP. I actually feel sorry for the honest people who have been blinded to it all by an incompetent and biased media.
alright folks does anyone actually believe that biden will undo the massive overreaches of executive power that trump caused and if so give me any reason why lol
I wouldn‚Äôt say Harris or Biden qualify as middle on police reform.   Trump will argue he has done more for reform then them, and he will have some actual points to make.   They all have invested a lot in our unbalanced justice system.
No. I'm an American. And I'm not dissenting anything. Or dividing. I'm uniting behind #BidenHarris2020  Im calling out the bot dissenters who are crying and saying they won't vote to try and sway others to do the same. Are you Voting Biden or sitting out?
Biden picking Kamala Harris only makes sense if Biden just gave up and intentionally didn‚Äôt try
Trump is the incumbent. His infidelities are well known and built into his persona. His voters know what they‚Äôre voting for and have made peace with it. Women won‚Äôt move from Trump to Biden for Harris. She is nearly as unliked as Hillary and she‚Äôs proven to be morally bankrupt.
Trump won‚Äôt have to. Willie Brown has admitted that he appointed her to high paying fast-track positions that she wasn‚Äôt qualified for simply because of their relationship. Biden has now alienated a female voter block who despise the image of women moving up from their knees.

Agreed. It‚Äôs wonderful. I‚Äôm even happier about the prospects of KH taking over the reins at some point. I see the Biden/Harris pairing as a competency or power equivalent of the Bush/Cheney ticket. Good news in 2020 is hard to come by, so I‚Äôll relish this until Election Day.
Joe Biden just picked for VP running mate Kamala Harris, a police officer who descended from a slave-owning plantation owner Hamilton Brown, told him to his face on a debate stage that his policies are racist  How could this possibly go wrong with today's Democrats?!
He's spent his life scamming Americans! The truth will come out b/c American's want 2 know where's Hunter &amp; his other QUID PRO QUO's! He &amp; Obama knew abt spying on opposing party!  will fileting Biden &amp; Harris! Just tell Joe it's groundhog day! Sad this is the best DEMS have!

This is the one thing Biden couldn‚Äôt do. The one thing that would show the Democratic Party hasn‚Äôt learned a thing in four years. As of now this is a Trump re-election. We‚Äôll see how they play it over the next two months but honestly I‚Äôm livid.
Regardless of my varying feelings about a Biden Harris ticket, the idea of a Kamala Harris debating Mike Pence is invigorating.
Considering Biden‚Äôs health...

But you don't see any value in him making a pitch for Biden to a segment of the electorate that might help Joe win?  Also, I'd really like to hear how you think he's done "immeasurable amounts of harm?"  Honestly curious.
OK, I apologize that I misread it.  I am inspired by people coming together to defeat an incompetent, immoral, and divisive president.  Kasich isn't going to talk about his ideas. He's going to make the case for Biden from his perspective; we'll see if it gets votes for Joe.
I don't think that's true.    and  are speaking the same day.  Also, did you read the joint policy recommendations from the Bernie/Biden working group?
Biden promised us a woman
OK yes Biden used the N word. 40 years ago. Why if he's so bad would a black man pick him as VP? And still endorse him now. Biden is the nominee you don't like it. Fine that's your problem. I'm committed in my vote so you are wasting your time and mine.
How is she a hypocrite? She supports Biden. And I take it your not voting. So like not voting STFU. Stay silent. A non vote is a silent voice. Everyone in politics has mud on their shoes if you look close enough.
1  a time. A book Trump read and quotes. Biden meeting Putin when VP not uncommon to shake hands. Proof that insurance companies are still fucking us. And Obama on the economy and why it's important to protect the Middle class. He did. Trump has ruined it. He's pres. 3.5 years.
Still with that shit.  Yes Biden gave support to the war in the beginning. Then he saw where it was really going and changed his mind. What do you care about human life? You support kids in cages at the border. You support suffering in South America and Central America. üñïüèª

It's almost as difficult to understand as Joe Biden speak.
The GOP wants to give bucketloads of cash to the wealthy who will hoard it. Biden wants to INVEST bucket loads of cash in the public, and when you lift the lowest level, everything above it rises. Biden's investments will return multiple times over the cost, and you KNOW it.
Trump's trillions for the rich don't benefit anyone. Not even really the rich. Biden's benefit hundreds of millions of people. Infrastructure reduces huge costs on everyone SAVING money. Child care and elder care reduce burdens on the health system saving money long run...

So if Trump can make law and move revenue alone, can‚Äôt Biden by executive order alone cut military 75% and use money for reparations? Think about it conservatives. Presidents should not have this power. Trump unlikely to be president second term.

Can‚Äôt wait till Biden uses new presidential authority Trump did stimulus to write his own laws. Declare emergency and take away guns. Cut defense in half and money for reparations. Raise taxes on rich 50% to fund Medicare for all. All by executive order.
So now president‚Äôs alone can write laws and move funding? Biden will love that. Maybe he will sign executive order cutting defense in half and use it to pay reparations? Or raise taxes on rich and fund more welfare, all by executive order. Don‚Äôt sound so good now?

Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.

Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.

Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.

I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.

The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

Joe Biden picking Kamala as his running mate has sent a surge of excitement into my mind and body that I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. Can‚Äôt wait to get about a bunch of lawn signs , bumper stickers, hats and tee shirts to share with like minded folks. Love this team. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I would vote for a rock before I‚Äôd vote for Trump.  Biden and Harris will bring sanity, dignity, and humanity, back to the executive branch. I‚Äôll vote blue and continue to press for progressive policies. #BidenHarris2020
There are a handful of people I would prefer to be president over Biden/Harris. There are hundreds of millions of people I would prefer to be president over Trump. November is going to be an easy choice.
question that is all on our minds - bigger JB: Justin Bieber (2011) or Joe Biden (2020)?
With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES
This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Looks like #Kamala is ready to get on the #Biden Bus.
BREAKING NEWS: Biden was confused and meant to say Susan Rice! #awkward üòÇ #Trump2020Landslide
Now that sports are basically cancelled, I imagine the Trump Biden debate is going to get super-bowl like ratings. Not
I've been saying this for months. A vote for Biden is a vote for his VP
Tbh I tend to unfollow. Thinking we can pressure Biden is ridiculous on so many levels
No opinion.  Just wish we could get rid of Biden.
To be Biden‚Äôs bitch I mean VP?
Also not to mention the First Step Act, a pipaerisan bill signed by Trump, which reversed part of Biden‚Äôs racist 1994 Crime bill that doubled incarceration of black men.
Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
1 biden yard sign
I drive for a living &amp; have only seen 1 Biden yard sign in my blue city
Sinclair story. Trump has made so many racist comments that pointing at Biden is grasping at straws
Trump is offering payday loans, but Biden will be stuck with the job of getting everybody to pay the money back.
Checks with his giant signature on them.   Just about any previous President would have been been more capable in this situation. As for Biden selling the country to China?  You know our trade deficit with them is larger now than ever. Trump personally owes China $400,000,000.00!
I'm not going to fucking vote for Biden
It shouldn‚Äôt be depleted at all!  That‚Äôs why we need Biden to save it!
That‚Äôs why we have to get Biden in to save Social Security!  My husband and I are receiving all of our social security benefits that we have earned.  The govt. has to quit borrowing from it!
WTH??? Biden can‚Äôt find his ass with both hands. How is he going to lead? Answer: he CAN‚ÄôT!!
Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her | The Babylon Bee
"But but but but but but but but we can pressure Biden to the left" that take has always been absolutely absurd to me it's lib thought.
Biden Train wreck! üò¨ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüá∫üá∏
Fitness  Biden rides a bike. Trump drives a cart. I can imagine Biden driving a cart can you imagine Trump riding a bike?
Okay so fair is fair if you want to unconditionally defend Biden people on the right get to unconditionally defend
People have been defending Biden despite every racist comment he makes?
#Biden rides a #bike. #Trump drives a #cart. I can imagine Biden driving a cart can you imagine Trump riding a bike. #fitnessforpresident
Well, finally I knew there was something to like about Mr. Biden !! A Corvette enthusiast!!!
Yeah I think the supremacist and nazi are out in full force supporting trump. I dont see them marching for Biden. Try again.
But I thought trump was winning? So basically the gop has to run 2 candidates against biden cause you know this whole trumpism is coming down. Get your shit together.
Yo,  are you one of the traitors working with Russia to get Trump re-elected?
Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.
Trump‚Äôs remarks signaled how contentious the campaign may get over the coming months.  via

Why is Joe Biden allowed to go to the games?
Why? You would vote for trump/pence because of Biden vp choice? That is absolutely silly. Look at the state of this country. We have literally become a shit hole country because of trump. And you would vote to keep that? GTFOH
If Biden's VP pick is not Kamala, you'll vote for Trump?  That's not a very smart plan.   Just thought you should know.
Does he remember who it is? #Biden
So did you not vote for the green tax incentives that helped his company grow, or did you forget, like Biden
I am beginning to think Biden does not have a stutter or cognitive issues.   He has a shock collar on and his handlers are zapping him every time he is about to say something stupid.     Sometimes they miss though
The right person for the job. The right pick for the times.   CNN: Susan Rice is the VP Biden needs.   via
Umm. You need to research Biden‚Äôs previous comments
Plus - does she have any name recognition at all? Seems like a lose-lose for Biden
Biden must be a pretty powerful Titan If he has the ability to hurt a god. Zeus blood in those genes????
If he wins the nation as we know it is over, I really believe that. Not because of Biden, but because the far left own Biden. Assuming democrats win that also means they hold the house and win the senate (most likely) green new deal, single payer, abortion at birth it‚Äôs coming
I would honestly pay good money to see Joe Biden beat the shit out of god.More elder abuse.  They shouldn't even let Biden run
Now You Know #3 - Biden is staying in his basement and in the presidential election race in order to keep  away fro DOJ in 2021.  , ,  ,   ,
Biden/Harris 2020... They Don't Believe in Magic, They Have a Plan.
Biden acts and sounds like a Christian, unlike Trump...

Biden had a great week. Who are you bulls hitting?  You guys are losing and you know it
Yep get rid of 45 and Vote Biden. TRUMP LIES AMERICANS DIE
Can't sleep.  I just keep thinking of new Dem ticket as   Harris/Biden Harris/Biden Harris/Biden  Compare: Biden is a teddy bear and she is a rattlesnake.
She was just biding her time, just as Biden did.  Just as Hillary did.
Will Joe Biden or Kamala Harris give up their salaries to run the country?
This message approved by the Hartis/Biden campaign!  Looting is good!  Reparations, you know.
Biden is bullying Americans who have been terrorized by Democrats during the COVID-19 hoax.  You feel good being part of a team of bullies?  I think you fit right in.  You are just like the people who stole my lunch money as a kid.
Biden/Harris...They Won't Try To Kill You.
‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô is the mantra of white supremacy. Biden and Harris are the huge challenge to white dominance as the nation becomes more multiracial and multinational.
Yesterday, one of our priests gave us his pitch on why we don't vote for Biden, especially with Kamala as VP.  I walked out, went into the ladies room, went back into church and made it through Mass.
#Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks #nannystate #feds no legal authority
It‚Äôs just Trump trying to distract from Biden‚Äôs VP pick announcement.
Just a thought...   What you resist persists.  Block the orange turd and give him and all the others no more of your energy.   Focus the love on Biden/Harris! That‚Äôs where our collective energy should be given.   #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
There is no attack on the USPS. Voter fraud will run rampant and illegal aliens can steal mail in ballots and vote and mail them in. Voter security is important to the President as is integrity in the election process. Hey, Atleast Trump isnt getting a fake FISA to spy on Biden.
She mistaking tRump‚Äôs rape charge for Biden‚Äôs glorious hope to the American people.
Dems need to repeal that damn law they wrote in 06, when they take all 3 branches. That should go in Biden‚Äôs list of to-dos. It total b.s. and undermines a constitutional mandate.
I've been camping and missed much of what happened.  Seems Harris is taking over the Biden campaign.  She couldn't make it onto the Presidential ticket just months ago.  What makes her think she can now?
SO WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT, ... BIDEN IS GOING TO COME DOWN WITH COVID ... SO ... OF COURSE KAMALA WILL HAVE TO DO IT FOR HIM .... I guess 1/2 a Brain is better than NO BRAIN AT ALL .... LOL üòù
Remember when you said sexual assault accusations against Biden (that Kamala believes, also) didn‚Äôt matter because Orange Man Bad basically?
None of us have a voice or beaten or locked up will happen to us.  Only the felons can speak. Treasonist people as Biden must be locked up. Must do their job  must make sure or after the next few months will probably stroke out for all the lies already told in ONE DAY
Here starts the lies. IF YOU HAVE THE FIX ON VIRUS THEN DAMNIT, please share it. You don't &amp; you know Obama/Biden did NOT replenish what they used on last flu discovered. But they only had to drop it. It was not even close and you people know it yet you go on &amp; on with the lies.
Opinion | What the Kamala Harris Pick Tells Us About Joe Biden - The New York Times
So Kamala did her candidacy announcement and it was actually, really good? Idk call me a hopeless optimist but my gut is telling me things are looking up should the biden/Harris ticket win
I am SURE the media will come out with a story on this and say Biden supports a domestic terrorist group because they are UNBIASED right? üòÇüòÇ
If you want Mexico and Illegal aliens treated better then LEGAL Americans and military veterand then vote for Biden and Harris. I prefer  he has kept his promises and done more in 3 yrs then Bidens done in 47 yrs in the Senate and as VP. Lol
DOPEY DON IS A LIAR.  VOTE BIDEN
Whatever you think of Harris, it‚Äôs nice of Tulsi to lend her to Biden.
What roadmap we are seeing is a wannabe dictator trying to  punish cities that he doesn't like.  Even though he has sworn to protect all america.  Real leaders like Joe Biden understand that.  whinny little crybaby men don't
Haha good move, lol fuck joe Biden.
As long as she stops Biden it.
Not just women of color, but many of us white women are 100% behind Biden/Harris.  However, I am also overjoyed because my daughter is a woman of color.
Biden is strong enough to move forward and do what is needed to be successful in his bid for president.
If they do it's because media hacks like you keep saying that Biden is a corpse even while he's in better physical health than Trump.
OMG! Biden's Staff Gave Him A Script So He'd Know He Was Calling Kamala
Why do you think women and people of color will vote for Biden? Cause they only vote for people with same genitalia or skin color? Surely they learned their lesson already. And Biden could live for another decade with dementia.
Politics are the worst.   Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
guys joe biden is on this list
It's time to think ahead (pun intended)..If elected, Biden will be removed in a 25th amendment coup led by his VP-"Alien head" Harris in 2021. The year 2020 will look like a Disneyland vacation in comparison, and the dismantling of America will be expedited. ü§¢üí©üëπ
I‚Äôm sorry y‚Äôall but Harris is Biden‚Äôs best bet. He needed to sway that last bit of generation x that was on the fence, and generation x loved Harris. He would‚Äôve lost voters if he picked a candidate too left or too right. She‚Äôs the most middle he could get that would benefit him.
It would make sense to do it today. Within the hour even. It would suck up any media boost for the Biden campaign.
If they have odds out there that Biden drops out in September or October and is replaced with Michelle Obama I would hammer it right now. üòÇüòÇ they are going to pull out all the stops in the next couple months.
I think you mean #HarrisHarris2020. Biden is done. Harris will be calling the shots.
Glad Biden made his selection.  Harris wasn't my first choice, but I'm gonna back her 100%.  It doesn't have to be perfect to be good.    Go Biden/Harris 2020!
Do you think Biden actually had a say in who is VP candidate was going to be? Guy probably doesn‚Äôt even remember he is running for President. üòÇüòÇ #DementiaJoe
I‚Äôm just gonna say I called it right when Kamala dropped out of the race that she was gonna be Biden‚Äôs vp.
FANTASTIC CHOICE!   WE GONNA BLOW IT UP!  BIDEN 2020!!!!!
Same. I'm technically a registered Republican doing my part to defeat Trump, and that includes following the path of least resistance for Biden.
Personally I agree that I will vote for Biden no matter what but I DO believe it's vitally important that she be extremely experienced in government because of Biden's age  and the fact that she could be faced with the presidency at any moment.
Biden 2020...He Won't Shit on America.
In the last few days, I‚Äôve been called a mother f*cker, for asking people to vote for Biden, no matter who he chooses as his VP. I was accused of impersonating myself (don‚Äôt ask) and I‚Äôve been sexually harassed by bots and people. I‚Äôm just a regular guy who wants our country back
I will one hundred percent vote for Biden, no matter who he chooses for his running mate.
..but Biden?? I still got highly inappropriate DMs. SMDH
The sweaty basketball pic, maybe?? Joe Biden, no offense? The football helmet? Please no..
Your stupid biden
I‚Äôm not telling anyone what to do, but that‚Äôs not cool for her to react that way. I was polite to her. She obviously only wants Warren. I‚Äôll support and vote for Biden, and whoever his running mate is.
This lovely lady, just called me a mother f*cker because I suggested that we all get on board with Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. I reported and blocked her. If you‚Äôre friends with her, then I suggest that you ask her to chill, and cut down on her caffeine intake? üôÑüò≥
Be careful of this person. They said F you to the thought of Biden/Harris. They are not a true resister or who we need, especially right now.
Guess what? I received just as many inappropriate propositions, if not more, with my new Joe Biden profile pic, then I did with my sweaty basketball pic. I‚Äôm not even sure what that says? I‚Äôm going to go with whatever makes me happy. I‚Äôm just blocking the pervy people.
Biden is a lying buffoon and you fall for his lies.
The image is definitely not how I would personally describe Biden‚Äôs opinions. It‚Äôs satire - but I don‚Äôt love it.  Your interpretation of the image is entirely up to you. But an image of enslavement has nothing to do with the enslaved‚Äôs mental capacity.
This is a depiction of what Biden literally said last week.
Ilan Omar believes  is guilty of SEXUAL Assault. UNBELIEVABLY She FEELS ‚ÄúJustice can be DELAYED, but should never be denied.‚Äù EITHER #METOO IS A JOKE &amp; needs to be shut down NOW! OR JOE BIDEN SHOULD STAND TRIAL NOW! We didnt wait for a convenient time to impeach
When I look at my profile pic in my circle, I‚Äôm taken aback a little bit. Not because I don‚Äôt love Joe Biden. It‚Äôs more like, who‚Äôs that old guy looking back at me? If you‚Äôre not following    and  you should be. They are all awesome.
The Difference Between Rump &amp; Biden...
Some of you may have noticed that I changed my profile pic to Joe Biden. This was my choice, but I‚Äôm going to navigate my account and profile, however I choose to. Does anyone have a problem with that? üôÑ
Haha!!! Amazing.  Biden is riding a bike.  Struggles to form a sentence, but rides a bike...like a 3 year old and people are sold ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Same situation for me here in Utah.  But I always vote.  Voted for Obama twice, then Hillary.  And I will be voting for Biden.

That's true.  I want a nice guy (Biden).  However, I am looking forward to him picking an ass kicking woman as VP to be our next president after Biden to keep the house clean for good.
A Vote for Biden is a Vote for America. A Vote for Rump is a Vote for Russia.
What sane person would want to play second fiddle to blithering Biden?
Biden 2020...He Won't Fuck You Over Like Rump
CONye deserves to share the same fate as everyone else in tRumps house of cards. Seriously thinking we might need the whole of Leavenworth to house the fallout of Biden's victory!!!
Looks That Way...Vote Biden 2020.
Biden should have gone with "Baby Got Back".
It is a false choice.  American blacks come from many different cultures, not all of which stem from slaves.  If you are talking about diversity of opinions, they are equal in that respect.  Biden doesn't know what he is talking about.
ROFLMFAO, they mention the Black and Hispanic journalists conference but don‚Äôt even bring up the Biden interview FFS.
You know Biden claiming that unlike blacks, Hispanics have diversity of thought is politically radioactive for Democrats when CNN won‚Äôt even complain about Fox‚Äôs coverage of it.
No way Biden could have a come back that quickly!
ROFLMFAO, same people who say Biden has to choose a WOC for VP FFS.
This isn't going to win you the minority vote.  nor is it going to lose it to Biden.  It just shows what a out of touch white supremacist you are.
Joe Biden:  There is no there there.
If we don‚Äôt want Biden, but also don‚Äôt want Trump.....what are we supposed to do?
Vote Biden Before Rump Ruins Earth...
Joe Biden‚Äôs deep, personal faith helped get him through the tragic deaths of his first wife and daughter (that he‚Äôs dishonestly claimed for decades was due to the other driver being drunk).
This is stupid on so many levels. Navarro helping Biden isn't unconstitutional. Obama helping Biden isn't unconstitutional. Besides, who's pulling the strings? Obama or Bernie and the squad? Because the two groups aren't aligned. Pick one.
I don't know which god Biden worships but I suspect it is the God of Mammon.
Yeah, Trump being an ass about John Lewis not attending his inaugural is the same as Biden saying Hispanics have diversity of thought, unlike blacks.
Ban this!  Biden wants assault weapon plan.  I can do some damage with this!
First, I personally do not believe in God or any kind of religion.  I find it all a con on humanity.  But I do believe Joe Biden and his wife have faith and are much more honest than the orange fool currently disgracing the Oval Office.  My vote is for Joe!
Religion is the deepest rabbit hole of all. Eons of ‚Äúbeliefs‚Äù negate our way of life.   Believe as you please.   But PLEASE live for the now. This life matters more than a perceived belief in the next. Not everyone shares your faith.  ‚ÄúBiden will destroy God‚Äù.   #TrumpIsNotWell
Rump is Scared Shitless of Biden...  Trump‚Äôs latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional ‚Äî even for him ‚Äì Raw Story
Watch your back yo! Biden is coming LMFAO!!!You mean Harris/Biden?
8out of 10 people in my state are voting Biden/Harris, they voted Trump 2016, but he didn‚Äôt deliver on his promise , jobs, coal, hurt farmers, and their lives are not better but worse.  Utah has always been Red, but I think it‚Äôs looking pretty purple right now.
No we will not be voting for you!  Your right about one thing though.  We will be voting for Joe Biden because we want a better safer life!  You have provided the exact opposite! #TrumpFailedAmerica
Goes to church regularly? Ha!
"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything."   You idiots created the opportunity for Biden/Harris. Don't go blaming us.
If Biden wins, the Kamala vs. Ivanka 2024 race is going to be just the absolute worst
I realize that many aren‚Äôt happy with a Biden/Harris ticket. HOWEVER it is WAY better than a Trump/Pence ticket. We need to realize that another 4 years with Trump will destroy ALL communities regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender identity or political party. #VoteBlue
The best thing about Biden picking kamala is, he will get to do it again tomorrow#50firstdatespresident
Okay, so based on your line of reasoning, I am super curious. Who are you voting for in November? And please don‚Äôt say Biden, because he doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative either. Maybe we should all vote for President Nelson
This is how liberal press is freaked out by Biden:
If Joe Biden wins I will be praying for the second coming to be here!
You are out of your MIND, Typical Liberal, Truth Means nothing, watch 15 minutes of Joe and 15 minutes of Trump, Biden will be a blathering idiot in places.  Trump is speaking all the time there are hundreds of hours you can pick from.
What? Are the citizens in these countries legally able to vote in the election? What does it mean, "Russia is working against Joe Biden?" Unless these countries are fraudulently voting as American citizens during election, why are they acting as if they get to decide? Nice try.
The October Surprise for the Biden campaign will be his VP pick.
What does Monolith mean?  Let‚Äôs wait and see how long it takes HIS People to get back to me!!
Amazing reading comments on this, especially if you are black and trying to defend Joe Biden. Why not show some love &amp; respect for President Trump who is defending you and addressing Biden for disrespecting the entire black community. Biden is not qualified to run for President.
In this case if you are choosing Biden it means never America.
What a joke! Joe Biden is the liar!...or more to the point, you've done more TO women and none of it good, you dirty old man. Get out of DC! Vote Biden and Harris!
And not to forget Tony Blinken, whose ‚ÄòWestExec Advisors‚Äô help companies to get access in China. Take a look at the companies these advisers are associated with and you can get a sense of what kind of China policy they will run
Here is Jake Sullivan, a key Biden Foreign policy adviser, listen to him and compare to Trumps team on China
I don‚Äôt think she will be in charge of foreign policy anyway,  it will be driven by Joe Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisers, the same ones that advised him when he was Vice-President with Ukraine/China portfolio.
are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
Literally someone had a Biden 2020 sign in their porch today and I wanted to throw up.
Biden &amp; Harris are going to restore justice. Tick Tock, Matt.
This is all I need to know.  Trump hats are made in China.  Biden hats are made by Union Members in the USA.
Postal carriers union endorses Biden, warns that 'survival' of USPS is at stake  The endorsement comes after the president's resistance to Postal Service funding, amid his fight against expanded mail-in voting.
Get excited about Biden.
I'm unhappy it's never that bad. Even if Biden wins I'll survive. My bank account and equity in my home may take massive hits, but I'll find a way to get through it and have a smile on my face
So why you voting for Biden?
It's a good question.   Why does Joe Biden want to see his own kind "cleansed?"
You should vote for Biden. He‚Äôs a good man and will serve us well. #BidenHarris2020
Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
List all the great things about Biden and Harris
Do you think Joe Biden even realizes he‚Äôs running for president or so his handlers have to remind him daily or hourly?
I‚Äôm LDS and Voted trump in 2016 And his handeling of pandemic and his constant shots at low income housing and how it‚Äôs ruined suburbia. And his racist ways I‚Äôll vote Biden/Harris
The democratic ticket has to be a joke.  No way are they running with a Biden/Harris ticket.  I am calling their bluff!
I'm to the point of just removing people from my life who tell me Trans Lives aren't enoigh of a reason to vote for Biden/Harris.  My life is all I have. Its plenty of enough reason.
uhh joe biden
There are no credible facts that Joe Biden is a pedophile.  This is another conspiracy theory. Don't fall for it.
News flash, Spanky, the world already is laughing at us. Well, they‚Äôre laughing at you, but as the supposed leader of this nation, the mocking of you is the same as laughing at us. If anything, a Biden administration will help America regain its standing in the world.
üé∂ Biden can‚Äôt run his own life, I‚Äôll be damned if he‚Äôll run mine üé∂
the fuck is ava gonna say when biden gets elected and people keep dying. doesn't count anymore?
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
I‚Äôm positive that 94‚Äô crime bill . wrote has done more harm to the black community than any conspiracy especially when u take into account Biden worked with segregationists to lock up minorities with tough on crime policies and mandatory minimum legislation
I'm kind of surprised that the Republicans' attempt at Othering yet another black opponent is not reportable as an in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.
"I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message."
Hey, asshole, it isn't getting better! Nobody has even a marginal grasp on this virus except the scientists. Stop lying to us, bastard! You SUCK! Vote Biden/Harris!  Trump turns toward a third season of coronavirus with a tale of success

Tell us now if Biden plans to raise Americans taxes? I don't know how it works in Canada, but I'm paying enough already without supporting the D's socialistic policy proposals for America.
Tell us what Biden/Harris plan for America? How much more in taxes are you ready to pay for the GND? Slavery reparations? Yes, they support these.
Tell us how Biden/Harris are going to help?
Well I'm hopping china blocks Russia out and helps joe Biden win win win because I still really think trump start this virus thinking it would save him to stay president then it got out of control and he and his family did not know how to stop it that's why he does not want to
If anything like this ever reaches  verification , Joe Biden will be looking for a new VP pick.
That's what Joe Biden has said. Is there anyone out there who thinks that they're taxed too little?
I told you Joe Biden is the modern day Harry Anslinger he has been since the 80s when he introduced Billie Holliday type legislation tough on addicts and the pushers just like Anslingers racist crusade but this time all minorities where Billie Holliday and whites got a taste too
I swear 2020 is worst than 2016 in the "2 party voting system, evil scale style":  Evil scale '16: Hillary 100 to Trump 50 (Trump was evil on words, Hillary was plain evil)  Evil scale '20: Biden 100 to Trump 100 (both equally evil on action and words, non-words for Biden üëÄ)
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs candidacy will be nuts‚Äù says man who died two weeks ago lmao
If they get to use this stat, Biden should freely use the current unemployment rate with no asterisk.   I‚Äôm being told that indeed, both wildly misleading stats are being used quite freely. In next week‚Äôs episode of Post-Fact Campaigning....
The things we have learned from the past whether it's #Democrats or #Republicans #Congress or #BJP, both are enemies of Islam while Trump may be visible and Joe Biden invisible or Amit Shah as Visible and Rahul Gandhi as invisible.  History has proved that.

Nah. Biden‚Äôs mind is totally gone.

How sad is it that Dems are more excited about a vice presidential debate than the presidential debate. I‚Äôm so looking forward to the PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE where Trump relentlessly assaults #RacistJoe and ol‚Äô Joe can‚Äôt mutter a coherent sentence. Dems always support Racism #Biden

Does Radical Islam make an appearance during a Biden Harris Presidency?
My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.
Biden should win.  Trump's chance of winning is not frivolous.

The Fred election model says:  Biden is materially ahead right now. Biden would be very likely to win if the election were today. There are three months till the election and a lot can change. Trump can still win. This year is crazy.
Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat
That's sad Joe Biden should know better. Trump four more years God bless you President Trump.
Psychopathic Sadist??? Look, being hyperbolic to the point of utter stupidity is a symptom of TDS. OBiden had the House, Senate, and presidency and gave us shit Obamacare. 50,000 people a year die because they have no healthcare. So yeah, go vote for Biden
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....
What‚Äôs remarkable is . actually wrote a Crime Bill that resulted in mass incarceration in the black community üíØüíØüíØ Biden worked closely with his racist colleagues to push crime policy toward mandatory minimum sentences and other ‚Äúget tough‚Äù positions
But did you also know that Joe Biden's ancestors owned slaves? Sauce üëá
tRump isn't simply "an asshole". He's a stoopid SOB whose incapable of managing a pandemic, killing 150,000+ Americans.  Unemployment at historic levels yet somehow Barry &amp; Biden's "socialism" has gotten you into a lather.  WHAT has tRump accomplished in 3 years besides this‚òùÔ∏è?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.

So you are already handicapping Biden's demise? What???!! Why didn't Democrats just choose Harris at the beginning?
You can stand by you decision and not vote for Biden but know this: Your big system-wide change may never occur and the things you want to see may have to come in steps. You can be making a difference now instead of waiting for the the climate to be right.

I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think it's become clear that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to appease our Neighbors To The North and secure the illegal Canadian vote.  I'm looking forward to Bill Barr opening up an investigation on Canadian collusion &amp; interference in this election.
3. Joe Biden's handlers' strategy still going strong, right  Cancel those debates!
2. Joe Biden's racism is baked into the cake. Y'all can stop wasting your breath on it.
Thread  1. How about a thread of tweets that have aged well?  Joe Biden's racism won't hurt him. ‚úÖ
Biden is a Dem
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.

Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
I‚Äôd vote for Biden if he ran with a can of applesauce, but ok.
"Harris said that she would pass the Equality Act on her first day in the White House.  She also vowed to end the epidemic of violence against trans women of colour, saying there must be ‚Äúserious consequence and accountability‚Äù."
Yeah, but I am wondering how that's going to work out. I would love to see that. Wondering if any Dems will get in the door in a supposed red state. Can't imagine supporting anyone but Biden and Harris! Finally, a light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel!
Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.
Tulsi is such a beautiful, intelligent woman. Why did we, the actual left, get screwed all over again with Biden/Harris when we had incredible candidates like Tulsi, Bernie, and Andrew Yang.
It‚Äôs Biden/Harris or authoritarianism. One step at a time.
My reaction when Biden announced  as his VP: HERcules! HERcules! HERcules! #BidenHarris2020
Biden could pick a table lamp as his running mate at this point and I would vote for him just to get the orange buffoon out of office.#Biden2020
If elected with Biden,  would be two firsts: First woman and first person of color to serve as vice president. Regardless of political preferences, I hope everyone can appreciate such historic firsts.   #TakeNote #BlackLivesMatter #SpeakUpandDribble #JazzNation
I‚Äôm so thrilled. I‚Äôm alternately dancing with joy or crying. I‚Äôm so glad that you &amp; Biden are going         to the White House. The horrible Trump years are about to end.

Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
Yes it is an exciting moment when Kamala‚Äôs appetite for political gain is greater than her belief in his sexual accusers and her anger towards Biden for supporting segregation... and the list goes on. Really good for Americaü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden is a tank with low aggro and Trump the damage dealer can't concentrate on a target.
Hahahaha... you're scared silly... which is saying something since you're always running scared. Vote Biden and Harris! Down with tyranny! Get rid of the lemmings and toss the lying Traitor Trump into prison and forget about him. He deserves a cold, dank cell with no privalges!
Biden once again ignores the Extremely Online on both sides and does the safe, normie thing.

Kamala came through and saved Biden like how anime characters come in at the last second and block the killing blow. Talking bout "Sorry I'm late....hehe"
I wonder if they are worried that the accusation Biden is just a socialist Trojan horse has more weight than they want to fight. So they chose a more moderate woman of color.
She will certainly help Biden carry California if he can remember where that is.
She literally called Biden a racist in the initial debates. So her hunger for political gain erases that now?
Does Biden feel bad that she called him a racist in the initial debates...or is that not matter now?
Honestly it doesn't matter who is choice was. I will be voting for Biden. With that being said, I like the choice.
give up. that was only possible with bernie. Biden has no such crossover appeal to Mexican voters.
Same. Biden was not my choice, by far, however I know how dangerous 4 more years of T is not just for me but for others.

Please vote for Biden.  I won't survive another 4 years. I'm scared.   "Conservatives in America are reportedly hoping Donald Trump will weaponise trans rights in an effort to revitalise his failing re-election bid."
Joe Biden is about as corrupt as they come, and he has been for a long time.  I couldn't care less if he's being exploited now. He spent decades exploiting us.
Now we got sleepy creepy lazy Joe. And brainwashed blond Miss Biden. and I don't know what kind of softball lobs this reporter was doing it was ridiculous. As boring as watching paint dry.
The market will remain bullish as long as Donald Pumpy is in office. IF (big if) Biden somehow takes the seat, I think we are in for a nasty mean reversion. I think we are currently pricing in a Trump victory, so some back door puts may present cheap premiums
It'll give Conservatives something to howl and scream about, after Biden wins and has to reinstate the taxes. Talk about snowflake tears...

Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline worsens every day. His family needs to step in and stop this presidential run. This is senior citizen abuse.
Trump squandered so much time &amp; has sown so much doubt, that I think Biden is going to have a huge uphill battle. But at least we‚Äôll have someone who will listen to science &amp; really care about American lives.
Biden hasn't had a tough question from anyone yet. When is that going to happen?
If  or  say a vote for Joe Biden or anything else is bad, I‚Äôm automatically voting against said advise. Tired of the lies and falsehoods coming out of the once proud and grand GOP.
You might want to get that checked. If dementia can happen to Biden....
Obama and Biden sent a pallet of money to Iran. Remember that?

Haha. You‚Äôll be waiting a long time for Joe Biden to A: become president  B: step in and keep antifa trash out of jail
Don't forget Iran would also prefer Biden. And why was John Kerry visiting with Iranian nationals after he was no longer in a government position?
If people think it's a coincidence that Biden is being seen riding a bicycle and driving a stick shift -- basic virility displays that his opponent could never match -- it isn't.
It's funny that the Biden campaign is now doing the generic virility displays and his opponent can't hope to match them.
Sooner or later, Joe Biden must show himself to the nation. Americans get to decide if this is really a man wh ou can serve as president.
Biden is going to win 65 and older voters by astonishing margins.

Lol Biden has attacked and tried to ‚Äúreform‚Äù Social Security five times in his career, you‚Äôre not fooling anyone cop
It will almost certainly not work and may even suppress his own voters more, and it is not going to change a Biden + 9 result. That is not the point, though, and if the race gets down to Biden + 5 or less, then it is a real problem.

I don‚Äôt think she will be in charge of foreign policy anyway,  it will be driven by Joe Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisers, the same ones that advised him when he was Vice-President with Ukraine/China portfolio.

are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
And Trump can control all his constituents? It's silly to assume a fact, based on a single biased picture. Either way, it's just pandering. I'm sure I could find things that Biden would contradict. None of it is helpful to the American at large..

Despicable.   Will not be voting Biden/Harris
I‚Äôm not sure that is accurate, but he HAS been on the side of most bad ones. Joe Biden‚Äôs 1994 crime bill has incarcerated more Black men than any single othe factor. Could‚Äôve reversed it as VP under Obama. Nope.
It's well known that people will accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. He has brought our country to this point with his lack of leadership and his stupidity. So he accuses Biden of poor leadership skills and poor mental capacity. He fools no one. He's out!
No, being handsy and sniffing hair is not the same as admitting you think it‚Äôs okay to grab women by the pussy. Who are the white supremicists supporting? thousands if not millions of white supremacists are Trump supporters. Find me one single white supremacist Biden supporter.

I told you Joe Biden is the modern day Harry Anslinger he has been since the 80s when he introduced Billie Holliday type legislation tough on addicts and the pushers just like Anslingers racist crusade but this time all minorities where Billie Holliday and whites got a taste too
I swear 2020 is worst than 2016 in the "2 party voting system, evil scale style":  Evil scale '16: Hillary 100 to Trump 50 (Trump was evil on words, Hillary was plain evil)  Evil scale '20: Biden 100 to Trump 100 (both equally evil on action and words, non-words for Biden üëÄ)
‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs candidacy will be nuts‚Äù says man who died two weeks ago lmao
I'll admit, still better than Trump in the GOP. But like I've said over and over and over and over and over again, it's like having to choose between herpes and full-blown AIDS. Trump and GOP = full-blown aids. Biden/Harris is like herpes, manageable
How about this for a Biden/Harris campaign slogan - "we want to bring back the status quo, we must maintain the status quo, for the greater good"
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.
If they get to use this stat, Biden should freely use the current unemployment rate with no asterisk.   I‚Äôm being told that indeed, both wildly misleading stats are being used quite freely. In next week‚Äôs episode of Post-Fact Campaigning....
The things we have learned from the past whether it's #Democrats or #Republicans #Congress or #BJP, both are enemies of Islam while Trump may be visible and Joe Biden invisible or Amit Shah as Visible and Rahul Gandhi as invisible.  History has proved that.

Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
MAGA is big &amp; loud &amp; blasts through without humanity. Biden is a real guy, does the hard work, &amp; has a cool soundtrack.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
Any #Canadian friends have some insights about me possibly moving to #Canada ??  -What's it like? -How's the weather? -How expensive/easy is healthcare or getting treated? -How is the housing situation? -Is #Trudeau better than Trump/Biden? Most importantly: -Will my cat like it?

This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!
My intuition is that this is a three coin-flip race. Biden's lead has been stable, moving within a fairly narrow range. At the low end, Trump still needs a polling error in his favor to have a 50-50 chance. At the high end, he's toast. Three coin-flips instead of two. 88% Biden.
#Biden should make a fourth debate contingent on #Trump releasing his #taxes
Biden should win.  Trump's chance of winning is not frivolous.
Unlike yourself. However, we are all aware the Obama/Biden regime is responsible for the division. Nice try though.

There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
The Fred election model says:  Biden is materially ahead right now. Biden would be very likely to win if the election were today. There are three months till the election and a lot can change. Trump can still win. This year is crazy.
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.
Haha just know Biden supporters will be treated like trump supporters from now on lmfao
I do not, that's one of Trumps worst decisions. But hear you me our troop presence around the world will increase dramatically under Biden. And the Venezuela coup will happen where Trump failed, and a hot war with Iran isn't out of the question
Biden was just shown in a video riding a bike without a helmet on.   The precedent for his impending accident has been set.
Current Indian government will not like Biden government. They better start praying for his defeat
That's sad Joe Biden should know better. Trump four more years God bless you President Trump.
Psychopathic Sadist??? Look, being hyperbolic to the point of utter stupidity is a symptom of TDS. OBiden had the House, Senate, and presidency and gave us shit Obamacare. 50,000 people a year die because they have no healthcare. So yeah, go vote for Biden

Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Mentioning Biden's memory while supporting/believing tRump is capable of anything besides...  *160,000+ dead Americans  *Record numbers or UNEMPLOYED Americans  *Caged Children *Grifting, Lying &amp; Conning at every opportunity
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
If Trump supporters are racist by association what does that make . supporters? This man considered Storm Thurmond(a racist, segregationist) a friend of his smfh and Biden sees nothing wrong with working with racists he‚Äôs proud of it....
What‚Äôs remarkable is . actually wrote a Crime Bill that resulted in mass incarceration in the black community üíØüíØüíØ Biden worked closely with his racist colleagues to push crime policy toward mandatory minimum sentences and other ‚Äúget tough‚Äù positions
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
But did you also know that Joe Biden's ancestors owned slaves? Sauce üëá
tRump isn't simply "an asshole". He's a stoopid SOB whose incapable of managing a pandemic, killing 150,000+ Americans.  Unemployment at historic levels yet somehow Barry &amp; Biden's "socialism" has gotten you into a lather.  WHAT has tRump accomplished in 3 years besides this‚òùÔ∏è?
As a conservative that isn‚Äôt thrilled with the way the Republican Party has gone, I totally would have supported a Biden- ticket way over Biden- . Kamala is part of the reason we joke that CA is ‚Äúcommie-fornia‚Äù. She‚Äôs an alt-left dumpster fire.

You can stand by you decision and not vote for Biden but know this: Your big system-wide change may never occur and the things you want to see may have to come in steps. You can be making a difference now instead of waiting for the the climate to be right.

I can't imagine Modi to have a free run under Biden-Harris administration.  India-US relations stand where they are.  However we could even see a "American Values" driven Foreign Policy agenda.
I think it's become clear that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris to appease our Neighbors To The North and secure the illegal Canadian vote.  I'm looking forward to Bill Barr opening up an investigation on Canadian collusion &amp; interference in this election.
3. Joe Biden's handlers' strategy still going strong, right  Cancel those debates!
2. Joe Biden's racism is baked into the cake. Y'all can stop wasting your breath on it.
Thread  1. How about a thread of tweets that have aged well?  Joe Biden's racism won't hurt him. ‚úÖ
Biden is a Dem
I think that a Biden presidency will be just about the same as a Trump one, except Trump says the quiet part out loud and Biden won't. And I actually think Biden will be worse on foreign policy. I could wrong but I don't think so
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
And you feel no bit of nausea with Biden??? That's all I need to know
If we know one thing about Biden, he'll definitely get behind her üòÆ
4 years of Trump and 4 years of Biden will look just about the fucking same. Except Biden and Co. will stab us in the back, and Trump stabs us in the front. At least Trump makes me laugh...fuck outta here with that "we can't survive" shit

My political prediction is this: if Biden and Harris win, in four years from now, 30% of the country will still be mispronouncing her first name.
Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris: "It's not fair to hold us accountable for the 'sins' of our ancestors."  Also Joe &amp; Kamala: "We think all current Americans should be held accountable for the sins of our ancestors."
The Joe Biden twist might be for some, though.
Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.

According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.

Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
Yes it is an exciting moment when Kamala‚Äôs appetite for political gain is greater than her belief in his sexual accusers and her anger towards Biden for supporting segregation... and the list goes on. Really good for Americaü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES
Biden is a tank with low aggro and Trump the damage dealer can't concentrate on a target.
Hahahaha... you're scared silly... which is saying something since you're always running scared. Vote Biden and Harris! Down with tyranny! Get rid of the lemmings and toss the lying Traitor Trump into prison and forget about him. He deserves a cold, dank cell with no privalges!
This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!
Biden once again ignores the Extremely Online on both sides and does the safe, normie thing.

I wonder if they are worried that the accusation Biden is just a socialist Trojan horse has more weight than they want to fight. So they chose a more moderate woman of color.
She will certainly help Biden carry California if he can remember where that is.

Now that sports are basically cancelled, I imagine the Trump Biden debate is going to get super-bowl like ratings. Not
She literally called Biden a racist in the initial debates. So her hunger for political gain erases that now?
I've been saying this for months. A vote for Biden is a vote for his VP
Tbh I tend to unfollow. Thinking we can pressure Biden is ridiculous on so many levels
Does Biden feel bad that she called him a racist in the initial debates...or is that not matter now?
Honestly it doesn't matter who is choice was. I will be voting for Biden. With that being said, I like the choice.
No opinion.  Just wish we could get rid of Biden.
give up. that was only possible with bernie. Biden has no such crossover appeal to Mexican voters.

Is that why Biden has already hired 600 lawyers to contest the results?
Also not to mention the First Step Act, a pipaerisan bill signed by Trump, which reversed part of Biden‚Äôs racist 1994 Crime bill that doubled incarceration of black men.
Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
I literally had a Distwitter person attack and unfriend me for voting for Biden and liking a Cardi B song. What the actual fuck?  I hate Distwitter so much.
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
I promise to vote for Biden even if he chooses a box of fruit loops for VP. The alternative is destruction of our country!

There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.

Stop projecting your own cowardice onto Biden.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
not seeing any reports of dogs getting ballots... Who has the strongest stance on squirrels? Biden
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.

A) I don't think VP sways votes anyway and B) I don't think there was anyone Biden could pick that would sway a 2020 Trump voter
will Trump debate himself when Biden refuses to show?
Biden isn‚Äôt even good enough for his own hashtag. You have to put Harris on there, he has already lost. ü§£ü§£ü§£
wonderful...yet we hear the postal workers endorsed Biden...those thru whose hand the ballots are allowed to flow...now that's some conflict...very dangerous
There is not one Democrat I know of (correct if I am wrong) that if for any restrictions on abortion.  Which includes biden and Harris of course. The open encouragement of abortion as birth control bothers me even past a religious aspect cause let‚Äôs be real I am bad Mormon
You have made one choice you regret. I regret voting 3rd party last time. It was a waste of my voice. Try option 3, vote Biden-Harris, and see if actual Republicans become a thing again under Biden. They won't under Trump. Check out  ,  ,
Absolutely not. I never voted for Trump before. I don‚Äôt think I will this time. I want to vote for Biden but abortion is a topic that sways me yes.
And not to forget Tony Blinken, whose ‚ÄòWestExec Advisors‚Äô help companies to get access in China. Take a look at the companies these advisers are associated with and you can get a sense of what kind of China policy they will run
How do you rationalize abortion when voting for Biden?
#VoteOutRacism by voting in Crime Bill Biden and the cop? Good luck with that!
For LDS people who support Biden, I genuinely and in the most sincere way want to know how your rationalize the abortion issue?  Pls no hate tweets or disagreements. State your case and I will stay out of it unless asked a question
Here is Jake Sullivan, a key Biden Foreign policy adviser, listen to him and compare to Trumps team on China
I don‚Äôt think she will be in charge of foreign policy anyway,  it will be driven by Joe Biden‚Äôs foreign policy advisers, the same ones that advised him when he was Vice-President with Ukraine/China portfolio.
How can you possibly call out Biden on Tara Reade without acknowledging these women?
If you go to his website he has policy proposals bur I have no idea if he is serious about implementing them.  Like Bernie I knew was passionate about Healthcare, Julian Immigration, Elizabeth Wallstreet reform, Tulsi Foreign policy. Biden no idea.
This is funny. I could absolutely see Biden asking this question when reading about #trumpGoldenShower lmao
Reasons why I should actually vote for Joe Biden when he is less than 1% likely to win UT and also I want to bolster third parties READY GO
I have never suggested  Biden is not flawed. He wasn‚Äôt my 1st or 2nd choice. But in our system it is him or Trump and, though imperfect, he is orders of magnitutude better than Trump.
And I'll vote by mail, as I've been doing in Utah for well over a decade, for Biden/Harris, and will know my vote will be counted and not changed because of the plethora of evidence that shows that doesn't actually happen.
It‚Äôs the WORST lol. Like, yeah karen I get it you *really* want me to vote for Biden, but I have a candidate this time that I actually agree with and like, so I find it more important I vote who I want to support lol.

are you kidding me Kevin Obama taking credit for Trump's job increase just like oh biden's taking credit for Trump getting peace in the middle East.
I tried to keep my mouth shut around my more centrist elders re: the election but they kept hounding me. So I told them straight. that I don‚Äôt think biden will win. When I tell you they would rather blame me if that happens rather than idk...a white supremacist government...üòë
People that hate Biden like to claim he's just like Trump which is bullshit. Biden will never seize mail boxes to prevent you from exercising your right to vote, he will never question your Americanness. It's so annoying that people don't understand the stakes smh

I am so glad to see this. Is Obama even able to be his biden‚Äô lol wouldn‚Äôt that be amazing
Yeap unfortunately. I don't remember the last time our country was in such desolate and separatist state. I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, but I think that a Biden presidency will worsen the crime rates, homelessness, and lawlessness in general.
If this was a voter suppression conspiracy, why would they be warning people of a potential problem?  It also assumes that the mail-in votes will favor Biden.  What is the evidence?  Mailed ballots were already a problem in the primaries.  I smell a hoax.
I know the definition. That's my point. It still doesn't say "Biden is a tyrant". It says a cruel, oppressive ruler is a tyrant. It's very generalized and subjective. So if someone thought Trump was cruel and oppressive, then he is by definition a tyrant.
What‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs favorite cum town bit?
Biden &amp; Harris are going to restore justice. Tick Tock, Matt.
Has Biden or Obama done anything like this?
It was only political in pointing out the problem with the term "tyrant" because anyone can use that to justify their crime.   "I don't like Trump, he's a tyrant." Or "I don't like Biden, he's a tyrant."   What constitutes a tyrant that gives someone the right to then shoot them?

I‚Äôm black and I‚Äôm just wondering what the fuck the alternatives are? Like I despise the fact that our only options are senile biden and fascist trump but what tf else can we do to get an ideal outcome from this? Not vote? That never works
My biggest issue with the movement. I supported him because at least he was proposing progressive bills with Kamala and Markey. I‚Äôll vote for Biden to fight facism and harm reduction. But I also have faith in Kamala‚Äôs senate record to move Biden left. We aren‚Äôt all that naive.
I‚Äôm pragmatically voting for Biden-Harris for many reasons, but would really have preferred voting for someone without questions about their conduct toward women. You should be free to voice your valid concerns about him. Protecting freedom of speech is one reason he has my vote.
Biden isn‚Äôt proposing universal healthcare either. That‚Äôs the issue. The public option will still leave millions uninsured

Hi Wizard! Just followed you! I am in Utah trying to fight the good fight. Thank you for being a resistor and a champion for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Americans! I am fighting with the democrats and resistors in this state.
So pretty much a symbolic vote all the way. I don‚Äôt really want Biden to win, but I really don‚Äôt want Trump to continue wagging the dog.
So why you voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm from Utah, and as someone who usually votes Republican, I‚Äôm voting for Biden for a couple of reasons:  (1) My vote will have little effect on the electorate. Utah will go red.  (2) Id like to send a message to the GOP to abandon Trumpism and fix some serious party flaws.

I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I have thought for 4 years about it. I've never voted for a democratic presidential candidate before. I feel very confident that this election is the time to change that. I personally see Biden as someone who cares. This country needs that now.
Right...I feel what the president has accomplished just in the past few weeks Is scaring the holy crap Ola out of the Democrats they should be ashamed of how they‚Äôre handling this campaign and using Biden as a stick puppet is frightening as well and Kamala boy she is nasty ‚ÄºÔ∏è

This claim of a "Trump Bump" is nonsense. Strong economy was built from 2011 to 2017, trump maintained for  few years then ran the ship aground. Biden will have to clean up his mess.
Difference, Biden's were dropped. Not enough credible evidence. Trump's were settled, with children no less.
Oh sweets,  how vacant your mind must be to surpport Biden.    Been in Goverment for 48 years and his only accomplishment is enriching his family.  Don‚Äôt even get me started on Harris.
Ignore this. Pretend it‚Äôs Biden/Harris at 34%. The US can‚Äôt afford another 4 years of this guy.
In such a time where violence towards Americans is decried, looking at the record of Harris &amp; Biden, one should be appalled. Harris keeping innocent people in prison &amp; other crimes should be shown on corporate media, yet its not. Government should NOT be allowed to commit crimes.
Also weird to think Biden/Harris wouldn't be anti-sex trafficking, since Harris practically wrote the book on fighting sex trafficking.
Also a weird flex to call the guy who started his term with a Muslim ban, &amp; apparently gave his approval to Pres Xi to go ahead with his Uighur Muslim concentration camps, as being for religious freedom. And Biden, who is a faithful Catholic and regularly attends, isn't pro-God?
But you're not sure if you vote for Biden against the man who spits on your fathers grave. Great daughter you are
I definitely follow politics.  I‚Äôm just not brainwashed and deluded.  But since you seem to think Biden Who is deeply religious is anti religion you must not follow politics very closely.
If there was anyone but Donald on their ticket they‚Äôd be attacking Biden/Harris with razor blade precision.
Don't expect any media coverage for this, but the lady who is running against Biden/Trump 2020 posted this:
The church isn't supposed to endorse politicians, so in a way, yes. That's part of my problem with this misappropriation.  Also, an independent evaluation has found Obama/Biden WH told 18 verifiable lies in their 8 years. Trump has told +20,000 so far in his 3.5 yrs.
Listen to the words coming out of Biden's mouth...,
I'm not Biden or Trump  #MyCampaignSlogan
Yep. Also it's a weird flex to say Trump, the dude who had at least 8 extramarital pregnancies ended with abortions, is "the most pro-life." When Biden/Obama literally oversaw one of the greatest declines in abortion rates in 30 years because they made birth control available.
People who live in a swing state/more competitive state should absolutely vote Biden. But I don't think we should urge people to vote blue no matter what in non-competitive states.
The problem is I don't see how we ever break the cycle. Say Biden wins on fear of Trump. The next election, the party and voters become complacent, some other right-wing nutbag wins a surprise victory, and we're right back where we started.
By reminding us of the fact that just a couple of months ago she mentioned that she believed Tara Reade‚Äôs allegations that Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. That will get the media off of the story that I called  a segregation sympathizing racist.

Lets get some activism then. But that is still no comparison to Trump who currently uses a man on his legal council that defended Epstein and that same lawyer raped an underage girl that was trafficked to him by Epstein.  Biden is better than Trump. Period.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in voting. For Democrats, Trump‚Äôs new remarks were a clear admission that the president is attempting to restrict voting rights. Biden said it was ‚ÄúPure Trump. He doesn‚Äôt want an election.‚Äù Trump=dictator!
See Biden as a "bridge" to a better future.
Trump admits he's blocking postal cash to stop mail-in votes, including the false claim that Democrats are seeking universal mail-in voting, specifically to gain an advantage in his November matchup against Joe Biden. EVIL MAN AND WANNABE DICTATOR!

I would offer this counterpoint. The fact that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is the DNC ticket is a far cry from accepting anarchists overtaking city blocks into the fold.
My issue is with understanding what their goal is. I've gotten a couple people to talk to me about it. It seems that for a lot of people, Biden having been accused of rape is a bridge too far. Harris' record with trans rights and hanging with CBP and ICE in general has them cold.

LET ME EDIT THAT HEADLINE!  Trump clashes with Biden over whether Covid-19 is real or fake news. (Biden insists it's real, backed by scientist/ Trump cites witchdoctors and Qanon cultists that it's not.)  There, fixed it for you üòâ
It‚Äôs still fuck Trump and he‚Äôs gotta lose this election. BUT I‚Äôm not gonna sit and pretend like I love Biden and Harris like a lot of y‚Äôall are for some reason.
You are subtweeting me like there is a better choice than Biden. Who is the better choice?
This tweet has to be a parody. No one without laughing can believe Trump is smarter than Biden.
Stuart C. Reid: This Republican will vote Biden/Harris - The Salt Lake Tribune
uhh joe biden
There are no credible facts that Joe Biden is a pedophile.  This is another conspiracy theory. Don't fall for it.
I mean, he lost his wife and daughter at the hands of drunk driver. He raised his two boys alone for years and then Beau lost his battle with cancer. Biden has experienced deep personal loss and can empathize with Americans in this moment. Trump cannot. ü§∑

News flash, Spanky, the world already is laughing at us. Well, they‚Äôre laughing at you, but as the supposed leader of this nation, the mocking of you is the same as laughing at us. If anything, a Biden administration will help America regain its standing in the world.

From the Associated Press:  frankly acknowledged Thursday that he‚Äôs starving the  of money in order to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots, which he worries could cost him the election.
If you combine this with Biden shifting key views like climate farther left throughout the election process. Progressives should still have hope and be excited about this ticket. First and foremost is getting Trump out of office.
Kamala should get more credit from progressives. She supports a plan very close to Medicare 4 all and the green new deal. She has a very liberal record in the senate specifically. Biden could have done much worse. Harris is a big win for me üëç
Yo, Hear me out. Joe Biden wins the election, after some months in, he‚Äôs dead. Kamala is the next president
If only Kamala Harris were even a fraction as far left as Trump is trying to paint her. Meanwhile multiple Wallstreet execs recently breathed a sigh of relief as they saw Kamala as a sign that Biden/Harris is going to be a moderate ticket.
The way I see it is progressives can protest and get mad and try to push the party farther left after Biden/Harris are elected. Priority over anything else right now has to be getting Trump and Republicans out of the White House. Nothing else matters if that doesnt happen.

Even people like  whose US citizenship was questioned because he opposes Biden/Harris as do I. They went with hes a Russian troll, even Canadian lol. The desperation.
The Krazy part is, my dad is a biden supporter and I say shit like 'I want candidates who support Medicare for all' and he says 'so do i' then we get in a fight about how corporate dems want to feed their donors all of the resources americans work for and he tells me vote trump
This is exactly why we need to take the 30% of dem voters and start a party, Biden supporters see people like John Kasich and mitt Romney as stronger allies than AOC and Rashida talib

1. A 7-point Biden lead would be some tightening. 2. 9% undecided/other seems high for this race. 3. The other results in here do not imply that much if any of that 9% will break for Trump.

I respect that wholeheartedly. I honestly think Biden will step down if he was to win they needed a familiar name to run &amp; him being Obama‚Äôs VP it only made sense that they would choose him

Nobody to the left of Lamar Alexander thinks Joe Biden or Kamala Harris are actually "progressive" let alone a full-blown Bernie leftist.

We're sucking screwed! At least until Biden/Harris wins!!
To me, voting for Biden is just a way to stem the bloodflow while we keep working for *actual* reformation to the system. Trump will negatively impact democracy and free speech (and freedom generally) a lot more than Biden, making the work even more difficult.

I voted for McMuffin in 2016 and will vote for Joe Biden in 2020. I still think teasing Biden about his hair sniffing and children on lap is funny. He‚Äôs Creepy Uncle Joe, every LDS ward has one or two of these close talking handsy older guys.
However when Joe Biden introduced her as his running mate and mispronounced Kamala he gets a pass! Tucker was following Joe's lead, but typical liberals only report what they want to hear.
Trump will make the stock market crash if he loses in November, and blame it on Biden.
Here's my question: let's say Biden gets impeached. Can you honestly tell me that a Democratic-controlled Senate wouldn't behave the exact same way the Republican-held Senate did in Trump's impeachment?  Don't project virtue upon the Democrats that they don't have.
I'll admit, still better than Trump in the GOP. But like I've said over and over and over and over and over again, it's like having to choose between herpes and full-blown AIDS. Trump and GOP = full-blown aids. Biden/Harris is like herpes, manageable
How about this for a Biden/Harris campaign slogan - "we want to bring back the status quo, we must maintain the status quo, for the greater good"
Look at that Biden strength, I bet he can drink water with one hand and walk down a ramp.

Hey  and  you might want to cover up, your bias is showing. I‚Äôve never had a tweet from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris show up on my timeline until yesterday. Now they‚Äôre all over it.
Calling someone racist who you know isn't racist is wicked. Harris did that to Biden, and she's about to do it to Pence.
I have supported many women along the way too. I just think you need to open your eyes about Kamala. She called Biden a racist. Was that true? If not it was wicked. She's ruthless. You'll see.
I love the smell of desperation in the morning!  Smells like Biden/Harris landslide!
Dear People Who Write Joe Biden's Tweets: This is a lie. It was very clearly proven to be a lie. And only people who live in a self imposed bubble aren't aware of it.
And those it happens to become ineffective. Biden isn‚Äôt. He has shown time again his effectiveness and longevity. This will be his grand finale.
Yeah, he tweeted about the bus system in Ogden a few months ago. I think he had a Biden moment.
Would you be outraged if he was wearing a Biden hat? Asking for a friend.
Any #Canadian friends have some insights about me possibly moving to #Canada ??  -What's it like? -How's the weather? -How expensive/easy is healthcare or getting treated? -How is the housing situation? -Is #Trudeau better than Trump/Biden? Most importantly: -Will my cat like it?
The center-right should abandon Trump wholesale. Vote for Biden, vote third-party, or leave that part of the ballot blank. But when it comes to Republicans in the Senate, vote for all but the true Trumpists.
And it‚Äôs in a state‚Äôs best interest to keep someone in the Senate. The entire body is structured around seniority. Biden‚Äôs longevity is one of the reasons he accomplished so much.

This Republican "suburban housewife" who lives in Utah,  will be voting for Joe Biden.
You can either be center-left or pander to the Twittergressives. Trying to do both just makes the Biden campaign look squishy.
What the Biden campaign probably THINKS it's doing is going with the safest pick that still gives a nod to the Sanders wing of the party.  But an ultra-progressive anchor is an ultra-progressive anchor, no matter how mainstream it looks.
Donald Trump is not her opponent.  Mike Pence is.   Well at least until they push Biden out but that won‚Äôt be until after the election.
Just did this and sure enough it goes directly to Joe Biden's site. WTF!!!

There are plenty of reasons to vote for Trump and there are plenty of reasons to vote for Biden.
I think the two party system is trash and should be done away with. But it‚Äôs not, and Biden/Harris is still MILES better than 4 more years of Trump/Pence. King is swallowing his pride and getting on board. That shows some fiber, to me
He may be a hypocrite (I barely know who he is), but these screenshots aren‚Äôt examples of it. I suppose you think Bernie is a hypocrite for supporting Biden, as well? Or Hillary for supporting Obama?
I was a Warren supporter and didn‚Äôt like Biden or Harris. But now I‚Äôll enthusiastically support them, because Warren is no longer an option. That doesn‚Äôt make me a hypocrite and it doesn‚Äôt make King one either.
I don‚Äôt understand how people think this is a dunk? The first tweet was in 2018, before the campaign even started. OF COURSE he would have preferred candidates. But now that it‚Äôs set, OF COURSE he would support Biden and Harris.

Biden Wins Over Trump in 71 Percent Out of 40,000 Election Simulations, Forecast Shows - Newsweek  via
Column: Biden picks Kamala Harris. Trump should dump Mike Pence and replace him with a yacht.
Oh, is she having trouble deciding between Biden and Trump?  Makes sense now.
Lots of polling showed Democrats were really worried about a safe, electable pick. Many of the rank-and-file were leery (and there‚Äôs a lot of problematic stuff tied up in that) of a black woman at the top of the ticket.   With Biden anchoring the ticket those concerns went away.
It felt like there was a little veiled misogyny in the field as folks easily dismissed huge flaws in Biden and Bernie, but cancelled Harris and Klobuchar for being mean and Warren for being...uhh...prepared
Because she was getting crushed in the polls despite utterly mud-hole stomping everyone in the debates.  I think the Dem Primary was funny because they'd fail to vote for candidates and then lament them when they suspended. Then voted for Biden and now grump about him constantly
Because Dems dislike Biden even more?
Are we deciding whether to put Cheney back in the White House, or Biden? You know, arms to ISIS and Black men to prison Biden.
I still say if Biden had wanted to win hands down, he should have gone split-ticket with Condi Rice.
Why can‚Äôt we switch it up right now and make it a Harris/Biden ticket instead of Biden/Harris?
CNN is now pushing for Biden to step aside after he wins election. Apparently, his aides are pushing this too in his weak state. In his campaign announcement, he said she would be ready to lead the country. Hmmm.
If we know one thing about Biden, he'll definitely get behind her üòÆ
Biden/Harris thoughts for  and
My political prediction is this: if Biden and Harris win, in four years from now, 30% of the country will still be mispronouncing her first name.
Then also google The First Step Act, a bipartisan bill signed by Trump, which begins to reverse some of the effects of Biden‚Äôs bills. Obama and Biden had EIGHT YEARS and did nothing for minorities in prison, even when the Dems held both Houses
Appeal to a lot of Utahns? Who writes for KSL, a teenager? Does Harris still believe Biden is a racist who hung out with segregationists and does she still believe the women who accused Biden of sexual assault? Obviously üôÑ Biden can‚Äôt remember any of this.
I know, I got an actual ‚Äúburst‚Äù of euphoria when Biden announced his choice for VP!  There is so much hope for us....
The DNC's embrace of civil rights is relatively recent development &amp; one of political expediency only.  I'm still voting for Biden, but I'm not happy about it. lol
I mean If we are talking morally bankrupt I think Biden more fits the bill, corrupt as the day is long, supports abortion up to birth, the equality act (that would destroy church education) but yeah let‚Äôs not vote for the guy stopping those things... makes perfect sense
But you‚Äôre spending more time criticizing Biden and Kamala than Trump and Pence. No free pass is one thing, quite another is a circular firing squad of people with similar but not identical views sniping each other for their differences while their true enemies go unchallenged...
Mixed thoughts and emotions about Biden/Harris ticket. Still supporting them obviously.
According to D. L. Hughley in his book Surrender, White People! Kayne is an "honorary white guy" due to hanging out with Trump &amp; spouting crazy nonsense all the time. Black folks have given him to White people. I'm not worried he's going to take any votes from Biden.
There are a lot of smart women too. He isn't fooling any of us. Biden-Harris 2020! Can't wait!

question that is all on our minds - bigger JB: Justin Bieber (2011) or Joe Biden (2020)?
With this pick, it mostly seems like Biden just gave up in the fourth quarter, which the Jazz completely understands
President Trump won't have to campaign against Biden and Harris....all of the former democratic candidates have done that already. Soooo much material out there....all from democrats!
Biden and Kamala are far from radical left. üòÇ As far as I'm concerned, they're cops too.
If you vote for Biden, you‚Äôre really voting for Kamala
This could be the market starting to shift to the idea that Biden could get the seat. Kamala Harris was a great strategic pick by the Biden team as she is known to be more of a moderate dem that is very wall st friendly. Loosing the artificial mkt prop was the cause of the dump
I think  will make a kick-ass Senate Majority Leader. It wasn't good for the country to have two very old people on the democratic ticket, so I'm all in for Biden / Harris. Glad a decision has been made.
If you think you‚Äôll see riots if Biden doesn‚Äôt win????  I promise you it will be ten fold the violence in one day then you‚Äôre seen in 70+ KAMALTOEHARIES
This is what works for them - just throw out every possible attack, even if they are conflicting. Their base will never notice, they just glom on to the part they like. It‚Äôs time for everyone to get to work to elect Biden/Harris!

No opinion.  Just wish we could get rid of Biden.

To be Biden‚Äôs bitch I mean VP?
Bernie needs to hire the top 10 funniest humans on Earth to help him write the ultimate roast of all time, for the DNC &amp; Biden, as well as the GOP, Trump, &amp; the whole political duopoly. Since he's probably not going to be alive long enough to be president after this, send it hard
Also not to mention the First Step Act, a pipaerisan bill signed by Trump, which reversed part of Biden‚Äôs racist 1994 Crime bill that doubled incarceration of black men.
Not to mention ISIS, which rose under Obama and Biden backing down to Russia and Syria, was squashed in a matter of weeks under Trump
Trust me Biden will have him removed. The military is not loyal to a President if Biden says remove yam tits, yam tits will be removed.
There's a difference between it being his house, which it isn't, and being the house he temporarily lives in. Biden owns his home. Trump DOES NOT own the White House.
I believe this would be extortion. What he thinks people are too enamored of him to notice is that those programs get funded when Biden is sworn in as president.
Donald Trump could pack $1 trillion in a suitcase and take it home when his second term is over and it would still be less costly and a better deal for America than the Green New Insanity and the Democrats  march toward socialism that would happen under Biden.
1 biden yard sign
The market will remain bullish as long as Donald Pumpy is in office. IF (big if) Biden somehow takes the seat, I think we are in for a nasty mean reversion. I think we are currently pricing in a Trump victory, so some back door puts may present cheap premiums
I drive for a living &amp; have only seen 1 Biden yard sign in my blue city
It'll give Conservatives something to howl and scream about, after Biden wins and has to reinstate the taxes. Talk about snowflake tears...

Sinclair story. Trump has made so many racist comments that pointing at Biden is grasping at straws
Biden‚Äôs cognitive decline worsens every day. His family needs to step in and stop this presidential run. This is senior citizen abuse.
Trump is offering payday loans, but Biden will be stuck with the job of getting everybody to pay the money back.
Checks with his giant signature on them.   Just about any previous President would have been been more capable in this situation. As for Biden selling the country to China?  You know our trade deficit with them is larger now than ever. Trump personally owes China $400,000,000.00!
I'm not going to fucking vote for Biden
It shouldn‚Äôt be depleted at all!  That‚Äôs why we need Biden to save it!

In an ideal world, Donald Trump would have a massive heart attack that kills him on stage during a debate with Joe Biden. In front of a live audience, answering some question with some completely made-up bullshit lie, he just drops the fuck dead? Wouldn't that be something?
Yeah I think the supremacist and nazi are out in full force supporting trump. I dont see them marching for Biden. Try again.
But I thought trump was winning? So basically the gop has to run 2 candidates against biden cause you know this whole trumpism is coming down. Get your shit together.
Yo,  are you one of the traitors working with Russia to get Trump re-elected?
Im telling you, he's getting re elected. Which is really sad because I don't think it takes much to beat him. However, Joe Biden is less than not much.
Nearly any thinking person could debate Trump. He can‚Äôt stay on topic, can‚Äôt focus, can‚Äôt speak in logical sentences, and can‚Äôt make an argument or reply to one without praising himself. All Biden has to do is show us what a sane person looks like.
Must be difficult for the Trump group running both the Trump and Biden campaigns.  Good news for Dems is that is how Trump got elected in the first place with Clinton's help running the 2016 Trump campaign.

What we really needed was Bernie. Needed him 4 years ago, needed him now, but the DNC fucked him in the ass once again, and gave us an establishment puppet. Biden is the status quo for the establishment. Still not as bad as the GOP
So did you not vote for the green tax incentives that helped his company grow, or did you forget, like Biden

Biden must be a pretty powerful Titan If he has the ability to hurt a god. Zeus blood in those genes????
If he wins the nation as we know it is over, I really believe that. Not because of Biden, but because the far left own Biden. Assuming democrats win that also means they hold the house and win the senate (most likely) green new deal, single payer, abortion at birth it‚Äôs coming

That‚Äôs EXACTLY what the stall is‚ÄîWhen he sees he isn‚Äôt getting elected, the funds will disappear and he‚Äôll blame Biden stating that HE could‚Äôve saved us. Pathetic and infantile brainwork.
Nancy you are so smart and never lose your cool, I think that is why Republicans hate you. Keep it up, Trump is half asleep, slurring his words calling Biden Sleepy Joe, you can see that Trump is desperate
The Biden/Harris ticket is so superior to Trump/Pence. They should not even be in the same election
Which is exactly what Biden said about Universal healthcare so I‚Äôm flummoxed as to your point. Didn‚Äôt your mom ever teach you that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? I‚Äôm about done with your veiled insults. You want to be right. I want to be effective.
USPS, step it up and get it done. be one of the hero's in this   covid season as well as the election. headline "biden/harris win in a landslide-usps delivered all ballots on time."
Exactly! If Bernie were our nominee I sure wouldn‚Äôt be demonizing him right now. This has to work so let‚Äôs roll up our sleeves and make some change!
My ex is Australian. I‚Äôm sure it isn‚Äôt perfect but it worked really well for him and his family. My parents are on Medicare and it‚Äôs far from perfect. Surely, the greatest country of all time can come up with something better.
I absolutely agree with this ‚ÄúCorporate influence doesnt belong in the platform or our  healthcare‚Äù but there is an advantage to public/private partnerships. I like Australia‚Äôs healthcare system.

If 90% wanted it then Bernie would have won the nomination.
I hope. In the meantime, a show of solidarity would come a long way in bringing the party together. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean compromising your integrity. We can still hold the moderate dems feet to the fire.
People are creatures of habit. They don‚Äôt understand this can actually be done. Let‚Äôs keep pushing Joe but not lose the majority of the democratic base by scaring them. Let‚Äôs show them how even differences won‚Äôt come between us and that we are committed to change.
And encouraging him to continue that progress into the presidency. And then showing the party that we are going to come together to make real change in this country?  It‚Äôs a missed opportunity just to posture.
This is the point. We all need to come together. Joe wasn‚Äôt my pick. But politics are designed to demonize the opponent. We have to come together. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if Ro had thanked Joe for being willing to come to the table with Bernie to move the platform forward....
And clearly I‚Äôm too fired up to type - ‚Äúhactially‚Äù???
This doesn‚Äôt do that. It doesn‚Äôt incentivize Joe. Sitting down and coming up with the best plan to move the country that direction does. I want universal health care. I work in public health. I lost my 39 year old brother to cancer last year. He had no insurance which delayed tx
Joe is a good person and hactially has a verifiable history of implementing policy change. We don‚Äôt come together by purity bashing.
Biden could run on a platform to dismantle the USPS and Democrats would fall in line and try to justify it just because he isn't Trump.  Change my mind.
Which Biden has adopted much of.... so what is the purpose of this? Nothing except to showboat. It doesn‚Äôt change one thing except give the GOP talking points about infighting.
Perhaps he should listen to his idol. Huh? Talk about insufferable.
I remember you calling someone a "petulant child" because they indicated they won't be voting for Biden.  Pot, meet kettle.
Why should I talk about Trump if we both know how bad he is?  You seem to be stuck under the illusion that Biden is not also a White supremacist corporte extremist. He already promised nothing will fundamentally change and that he will go after "anarchists."
Okay. So the words and actions of the DNC are lockstep with the GOP, and Biden is a right-wing corporate extremist. And you are just gunna go along with it and tell the rest of us to lick the boot with you.  No. Thanks.
While ignoring, entirely, that Biden will perpetuate the Oligarchy and trying to sell him as the most progressive candidate in history (hahahahaha no)  Maybe try being honest.
Its time to replace the traitorist fake Republicans with real Republicans. Non-sychophants to Trump. I'm voting for Biden just to get that traitor out.

If not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, then not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden. Therefore, based on this logic, a leftist who votes 3rd Party or independent is an ultra-powerful supervoter with 3 times the voting ability. See how that works?  #KHive #BidenHarris2020

Hearing he is going to prosecute Former President Obama and Former Vice President Biden and Obama for treason for spying on him...
Other. I‚Äôm not voting for either Biden or Trump. I‚Äôll likely go third party or write in. Unsure of who as of now. I refuse to pick for the lesser of two evils and the only way to make a third option viable down the road is to start voting for them now.
Friendly reminder that Biden‚Äôs entire reason for opposing #M4A is literally ‚Äúmy family is rich and we still faced hardship so fuck the poors‚Äù
No, but I'd wait 8 hours in line to keep Biden out.
No. There are plenty of reasons Harris and Biden are awful without resorting to this shit.
Harris just showed why Biden chose her
Well, maybe if you manned up and stayed in the running things could have been different. No one wants Joe Biden.
That‚Äôs silly that‚Äôs Joe Biden and his bladder control issue.
Dude voting for Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt about fixing every problem the Trump administration caused. It‚Äôs literally about getting them out of office. That‚Äôs the FIRST step and the ONLY way we can even BEGIN to clean this gd mess up.
I am hoping that he gets beaten so bad that he cant claim he actually won probably about 75% of the vote going to Biden
things that have made me cry today-  3 different tiktoks  The 2nd page of a book I started reading  And a video of Joe Biden where you can see that he has a heart emoji next to his wife‚Äôs name in his phone
Biden did not even know who his.vice president was because the left told him who to pick
President Trump 2020 for keeping America Great!! What has happened to our country and the world is not President Trump‚Äòs fault or mine or Joe Biden‚Äòs it is China virus ü¶† that‚Äôs why we are sick üò∑ Stan together quit fighting and keep America great.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Glad to see a woman on the ticket for VP. Joe Biden marked history in so many ways! Joe you are every woman‚Äôs hero forever! Your legacy will live on forever! Now let‚Äôs kick out Chump and Pence so that we can get much done! Let‚Äôs unite, do right &amp; make America better.
Absolutely! If anything, the blame is on the DNC for splitting the left vote. Most of the left was NEVER going to vote Biden or Harris, regardless. Bernie was the compromise for many on the left.
Ok never mind, i figured it out.... But dont get your hopes up, it will never happen. Mondale chose Ferraro, McCain chose Palin and Clinton ran as a female candidate against Trump and that failed. So I highly doubt that Biden will win. Trump will be a 2 time President.
imma bring this back bc y‚Äôall workin my nerves lol just bc Biden/Harris isn‚Äôt our first choice doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt vote?! Lmao y‚Äôall the same ppl that failed 16yr old me 4yrs ago by writing in harambe .
Congratulations on being  pick!  I am a independent center right voter usually, but you and Joe Biden will be who I vote for.  Looking forward to you and President Biden re-uniting our torn and divided country.

Wrong. We ‚Äúsuburban housewife‚Äôs‚Äù are a myth you generated in your pea brain. We women are educated, co equals in our families, raise children and bring in the bacon. We‚Äôre voting Biden Harris.
Lol do you think Biden and Harris do?
Thanks to Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP, I get to drag my Viking name out of the closet. An AOL-era edgelord irritated that he couldn't get a rise or his way from a woman in tech support dubbed me Amanda the Nasty. It's been a thing insecure guys do for decades. #nastywoman
Ya trump is an asshole but the media barely even focuses on the actual shit he does wrong They care more about 2 scoops and his verbal gaffs than kids in cages because if u trace the kids in cages back just a few years you start seeing Obama and Biden‚Äôs signatures on everything
Unlike trump, Biden has reading skills!!
Who had the diaper duty today when you learned you and Mikey are up against Biden/Harris?
Joe Biden made the laws in California? Weird.
News flash... Biden dodged the draft 5 times too
Biden is a racist and kamala doesnt care that minorities are filling prisons for petty crime.
at work this lady pulled out her phone to look up one of her rewards and then she went ‚Äúoh look Joe Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate‚Äù and i kind of just stood there like
Everyone knows Biden is a racist
Kamala Harris and sleey Joe Biden are an improvement on Mike Pence and sleazy Don Trump-I can see the debate now and Pence had better wear dark pants, because it won‚Äôt look so bad when he pees his pants
Chief, if you like minorities you should not be happy about kamala and bidenüòÇ
I'll go with Jill Biden
If you‚Äôre voting based on qualifications alone you should absolutely vote for Biden/Harris over Trump/Pence.
This is what cracks me up about Rs on my timeline freaking out over Biden, and now Harris. They're like the two most centrist candidates of the bunch, not named Bloomberg.
Fukushima news ;; Biden Picks anti-Nuclear Energy Kamala Harris VP Kevin...  via
People will respect the average older person with mental illness, Biden has been a corrupt politician who consistently throws rocks (metaphorically) at political opponents.  He‚Äôs not an innocent old guy.
Biden‚Äôs a dirty old man
The only question now is how long Biden will be in office before the Democrats compassionately invoke the 25th Amendment. Days? Weeks?
Kamala Harris prosecuted over 1,500 people for possessing marijuana as attorney general in California. She also seems to have flip flopped on her previous accusations of Biden being racist. She is running with the man who supported the 1994 crime bill...
The dichotomy between leftists and liberals in my circle on the Biden pick is stark:   Liberals: I love this ticket! Let's beat Trump!   Leftists: Hahahahahahahaha
It really makes very little difference. Trump and Pence are ogres. Biden and Harris will smile nicely as they fuck you over. They're all cut from the same cloth, and none of them will be running the country anyway.
That's of little comfort to the millions Biden and the cop will continue to fuck over.
Biden/Harris....I think it's a win..
Mmmmm Joe ‚ÄúCrime Bill‚Äù Biden and Kamala ‚ÄúThe Cop‚Äù Harris. Now that‚Äôs a dynamic duo of #resistance! üìé
I am offended: Trump thinks that men are upset because Joe Biden is selecting a woman, for Vice President. there are many good men that joe could have picked but the women on the list are all more qualified than them. I think all women should be upset about this
I truly think that Biden will pick Susan Rice as his running mate.  She has worked closed to him for 8 years and has all the experience we need right now, in this country and outside this country.
And the next President of the United States is (insert Biden VP pick here).
I agree. I also see why they‚Äôre having him speak: it‚Äôs not like Biden has ever been one to buck tradition.
Politics and culture in this era: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and The Making of the President 1972:
Apparently Biden does.  But you‚Äôre more ticked off Biden showed he‚Äôs fit, and trump is not
Biden has three things going for him:   1. He‚Äôs not Trump. 2. He hung out with Obama for eight years.  3. Coronavirus, major unrest, and Trump being Trump keeps the focus off him, potentially making ‚Äúrunning out the clock‚Äù to Election Day a viable strategy.
If the GOP was running practically ANYONE else I‚Äôd be all in. Romney, Rubio, heck, even Pence would be fine, because it‚Äôs just unimaginable to me that anyone would think Biden would be a great President. Sorry.
Whooooo! Biden-Imminent 2020!
I will vote for  Biden. PERIOD!!
Meanwhile in the Biden household
Joe Biden disqualify him for the White House so we can keep President Trump for 4 more years
The implication of your statement is that Biden couldn't/wouldn't govern with people who attacked him or tried to upstage him. I sure hope that's not true.
Thank you!
Talk about a complete joke, if your blind you could make these claims, but for the rest of us that watch any Biden video can see it plane as day.
Won't have any investment goals if Biden wins! Market crash

Libs: "If you dont vote for Biden you are a racist!"   *Joins the #PeoplesConvention for a People's Party*  Libs:
So Biden will cancel Religion? Wow that‚Äôs pretty ballsy of him.
He arranged for the impasse on purpose so he could claim this ‚Äúgift to the people‚Äù for his own. If Biden were smart, he‚Äôd announce his VP pick tomorrow and suck all the air out of this stunt... which works bc he promised to announce this week, anyway.
It‚Äôs interesting that we can‚Äôt afford a payroll tax cut but we could afford free college and free healthcare according to Bernie and AOC? Wonder if Biden thinks we can afford those?
What is the impact of Biden‚Äôs VP choice on the race?  Or How do you keep your eyes open during a picture? (I seem to always blink on the snap)
You're so desperate and full of fear knowing that you're down the road in November that you stay awake at night thinking of ridiculous lies about  Biden. No one with a brain believes your bullshit.
No Wrist Corsages, Please
Lets not forget Biden's "Poor Kids are just as bright as white kids" quote or his wonderful "7-11/Dunkin Donuts" quote.
Jerry Falwell Jr., Newt Gingrich, Donald J. Trump-adulterous men. Fierce believers in the Bible, all pretend they love God. Joe Biden first wife died in a a car crash, still married to his 2nd wife goes to church regularly, really loves God-what kind of God would not favor Biden?
Because Biden wants to do push ups, his mind is not right
Do you think making up this list is going to divert the attention of, anybody who has at least a 5th grade education, away from the fact that Joe Biden has dementia? Pop the bubble!
ashamed to be from Utah sometimes. If you think this is right, you love dictatorships! You're a fake patriot who picks and chooses amendments. Are you cool with Biden making life sentences for not wearing masks when he's elected?
Can you imagine Biden on his first day in office issues an executive order saying ‚ÄúNo more God‚Äù. üòÇ His dumdass followers believe this crap.

I Agree. Mr Biden is a deeply religious family man. He is a community supporter and a patriotic individual.

Holy shit! Biden‚Äôs savage!
I will go where I want.  Voter shaming a leftist-independent is not how you won voters for  or the  A candidate earns my vote through their policy and their character.  is a disgusting, creepy racist whose policy has slowed progress for decades.
I was never going to vote Biden lol  Go phone bank some Republicans, you'll have better luck there.
Joe Biden has the Democratic Party behind him, a lot of Republicans would vote for a crazy person before they would vote for a Democratic candidate
Honestly most of the stuff Biden says confuses me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Hmm...hurt God? Mister 2 Corinthians?
Instagram also had a "glitch" where negative Trump posts wouldn't show up in Trump hashtag searches but negative Biden hashtags produced negative Biden posts.

Why? Is it because he's the great Statesman, Joe Biden, or because he's not Trump. Can't fathom the former, so it must be the latter.
