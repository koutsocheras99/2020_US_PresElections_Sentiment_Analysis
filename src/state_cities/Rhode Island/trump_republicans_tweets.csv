Trump suggests delaying 2020 election, a power designated to Congress
It'll be Trump supporters starving &amp; GOP will lose the Senate &amp; WH.   You're such a great negotiator. 🤣 Telling someone to starve who is college-educated &amp; has a job in the worst recession we've had since the last RePUKE POTUS crashed the economy. I won't be the one starving.
I also have more bad news posted on Twitter LeBron paid all felons fines so they can vote in Florida! Trump only won by 100000 there are 1million felons voting now in Florida 😩 trump will lose Florida
This is better than Trump’s Eid el Adha tweet

If you want Trump out of office do not vote for Kanye. I feel like Ye’s sole purpose for this whole campaign is for publicity and to split the black vote between him and Biden. Thats the only way Trump can win this election.
Having only heard bits and bobs on the radio about Trump’s crazy “delay the election” notion, I have to say I’m holding my breath that Republicans (like McConnell and McCarthy) continue to naysay the idea. Enabling such an election delay would enable the end of our democracy.
My maga stepmom drinks it and uttered the words “Trump has done more for black people than anyone” while holding a can. What do I win

96 days until the presidential election.  Yet another reason why Donald Trump should move out of the White House on January 19, 2021. Reason #96: Because he is ultimately responsible for the death today of 150.000 people in the United States
Trump can't do anything now to stop virus shutdowns that's killing us and economy or end violent rioting !! So what will he be able to do after Nov3 ? Just asking ☹️

What’s worse the fact that your created this page because trump rejected you? Or like this shit
Plus, 7-% of Trump's are FAKE.
Yeah, that and that it's against the law.  I can't wait until Republicans pull the plug on Trump. It's long overdue.
Wait, not to get involved, but just for clarification, are you saying Trump was joking with that tweet? As marked by the three question marks instead of one question mark, which would note it as a serious tweet???
Or vote in nov because trump is scared of losing
Wrong he died from the trump virus
But why do reporters lose their minds on the stupidest questions of trump and the same hacks don’t even ask Biden questions? “Reporters” is a stretch. Just start calling them assholes.
How about less fun and games social hour during a pandemic and more productive pandemic problem solving if Trump can't cut back on his fun and games social hour it just reinforces once again that Donald Trump is a sack of shit
Trump broke me! 😭😭😭😭
The closer we get to November 3, the crazier trump and his supporters get. Enemy nations such as Russia are watching and waiting for their opportunity to destroy us.   We must be diligent.
Trump every day.
EPIC FAIL: Donald Trump crashes the economy and then floats postponing the election.
This 💩 continues until President Trump is elected again.
I just deleted my reply to you because I see you are a trump fanboy and probably wouldn’t understand an intelligent reply.
That's why Russia and China are facist more than communist or socialist. They technically aren't either. Authoritarians use communism and socialism to sound legit. Like how NK says DRNP. I personally think it's possible if trump wins a second term to consolidate power
Hey Twitter Pals,lots of talk starting to rumble around about postponing the election, I heard it talked about on  and a lot of tweets today, so constitutional scholars, America voted for trump and pence for one term,so that ends on 1/20/21. No one is re-elected 1/2
Obama and trump were never political oppenants. How are sitting presidents supposed to investigate canidates if there's a suspicion of crime?
Cain was not able to understand the importance of protecting himself from the novel coronavirus, and he paid the ultimate price for it.  He should have never believed Trump’s BS.
Trump is a whole joke !!!!!!! He swears he’s a dictator
the only thing Trump has been focused on is turning Americans against each other by stoking racial tensions and other sinister us VS them topics

Not true. I’m sure Trump will vote for himself.
BS Trump has done nothing to protect American workers because he only cares about himself and no one else
Trump did not want to talk about horrendous economic news. Hence the day-long distraction re: election. And too many people bit.
Yeah. Sorry, not flying. He stuck with Trump when his opposition would have made a difference. A real Susan Collins profile in courage.
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
INBOX:  releases statement on  Tweet on delaying election:   "...Trump is sowing confusion about bedrock principles of our democracy to distract from an accelerating pandemic, a massive economic contraction and his campaign’s sinking poll numbers."
I just convinced a trump voter on my FB page!  It took a while but now he understands. I will take that as a win.
Trump: "I'm not joking I never joke around."
So basically nominate Romney 2.0? The Republicans will lose all the obama trump voters.
You would think that even if they're all this evil, the nearly 3 million Trump voters in New York and millions more in other blue states might opt for something better than this.
Maybe if Donald Trump got invited to a funeral he would say something bad too

Trump is a lying
Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election. Pay attention idiot
I'd agree but let's be honest as to why they're willing to go on record: under Trump, the economy contracted by a third (annualized) and they need a distraction.  Its self preservation by elected Rs, not principle.
I think Trump wants to order food from China.
Wow, Trump’s face looks so bad it looks like Hillary Clinton photoshopped her vagina on it.
Who the fuck writes these pressers for Trump? #idiotsrunningtheshow we don’t believe you simply because you say it.  please wake me from this nightmare.
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You’re a fucking assclown.
this press conference from Trump is a waste of everyone's time because he just spreads lies and misinformation during it causing more harm than good. if you watch it I suggest have your fact checking site ready to check everything he says
wait.. forget everything else.  are you saying that half of all men who exist are trump supporters? i’m pretty sure there are a ton of options out there. also why tf would i want to be with someone who supports such asinine, racist behavior? hard pass

Many rats leaving the ship of Trump today!!
I beg to differ. I’m an elementary school principal, and Trump in no way measures up to any of my fifth graders! Not only that, my students are bilingual, and Trump doesn’t speak any language proficiently.
Look where that got Trump.
Neither. This is Trump trying to normalize the idea of moving the election, which he will attempt to do.
Dream on. Trump will either make a request that will be denied and he'll cancel or find an "emergency." That tw has nothing left. 150,000 dead Americans, the economy in the toilet with no end in sight. What do you think the death toll will be by then?
If you’re upset about #UI ending &amp; lack of help for state/local &amp; #smallbiz, look no further than Republican infighting. Other nations are handling this crisis, but Trump Admin disarray coupled with GOP-backbiting is leading to surging infection rates, unemployment, &amp; misery.
So we’ve all wondered what it would take for a meaningful number of Republicans to step out in opposition to Trump. Shooting someone in 5th Ave would not be enough. Suggesting that we delay the election apparently is. via
and today, in 2020, "whatever Trump says" became the Republican party's motto.
You think Taliban need incentives to kill our guys?  Use your brain instead of parroting something you "heard".  What do you suppose Trump should do even if true?  Start a war with Russia?
The silent majority is the millions of conservatives who now realize Trump is completely in over his head but don’t speak up because they don’t want to be attacked by Trump’s supporters
Trump has no interest in delaying the election . An on time election helps him out because his base is full of covid deniers who will cough on each other at the polls as a statement of freedom, it’ll be democrats staying home . His only goal is to throw doubt on the outcome
You folks really need to get over yourselves. Some people don't hate Trump. Life goes on.

i would love for someone to ask Trump why Americans can't travel to Russia
People without jobs who don't earn big paychecks are being shamed by Trump-Republicans as lazy &amp; undeserving of #unemploymentinsurance during a pandemic. But it's the Trump Admin that should be ashamed for its mishandling of this crisis &amp; for tanking the economy.
what are the odds Trump has ever tried the "Great Pizza!!!"?
Bruh even before trump, when I would see pick up trucks riding around with 2 big ass American flags, I would just like “now I know for a fact they’re racist”
The thing about this horrific sentiment is that reacting to crises first, or even primarily, as PR crises is far from just a Trump admin thing
Trump and Pompeo showing their hand on delaying election may not be constitutional but the message to GOP Governors is clear, do everything you can to interfere with the election process in your state.
Dead from COVID that he caught at a Trump rally...
But will trump apologize?
Every time I post something defending black lives matter my trump side of my family slide up and say some shit, as if i’m gonna read it! 💀
"Ballot harvesting"? I believe that's called "voting." But yay, you! for not going along with Trump's bullshit on this.
I love that these idiots can't quite figure out whether to cling ever-more-tightly to Trump or pretend they've never heard of him.  Doing both seems problematic.
Trump wishes he was half the man Obama is. He's the most dispicable person on this Earth
CNN is currently pursuing today's shiny object by having palpitations over Trump's suggestion that the election could be delayed. Please don't fall for this: report on the atrocious economic numbers, which is what he DOESN'T want people talking about. Thank you.
Hermann Cain, after the Tulsa Rally where he contracted #COVID19:  “The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." RIP.  Needless deaths abound, Trump is guilty of mass murder.
This is the hollow bullshit of a fascist.   Donald Trump directly caused Herman Cain's death.
Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after contracting Covid. Not clear when/where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than 2 wks after attending Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa in June. Co-chair of Black Voices for Trump.

So you must really have an issue with Biden's words as well? Or is Biden different? Are you willing to accept what he says because he's Democrat? Or because he's NOT Trump? How is this any different?
The GOP every time Trump says something dumb and fascistic:
Which is hilarious considering how the left disparages any minority Trump supporters or any minority Republicans in general while at the same time making an issue about lack of diversity in the GOP. It's a catch-22 for any minority wishing to be Republican.

delaying the election will not pause the pandemic. delaying the election will not make me support trump. delaying the election will not bring back the innocent lives stolen by police brutality. delaying the election will not end sex trafficking. delaying the election won’t work.
This is made so much worse by the era of Trump, when it is so tempting to return to an era when everything was still terrible but the guy in charge was smart and likable.
Let us not getting distracted by Trump. The President is speaking! Tune in!
Why do Trump supporters make supporting Trump their entire personality? Were they really that much of a fucking loser in high school that they finally feel like they fit in? I just don't get it?
We can't make a deal because you spent the WHOLE LAST CARES package ROBBING THE TREASURY WITH YOUR WIFE AND DONALD TRUMP.
We can't make a deal, because instead of helping all the  hurting Americans, you want to make sure no hotels can compete with Donald Trump's hotels.
We can't make a deal because instead of being an "equal and speperate branch," The  is Donald Trump's tiny penis extenision.

Statement by Secretary of State  on President Trump’s Disinformation about Elections
I think Trump doesn't think he will win this election!. I would have been more convinced to postpone if he said he's worried about increased #COVID19  cases; he wanted to #FlattenTheCurve but no, he's worried about an inaccurate election.

Remember a couple of weeks ago when I said that Coronavirus has both delivered the biggest blow to Trump's chances of reelection and, simultaneously, given him the best and easiest path to steal the presidency in November?  … yeah.
I’m watching videos of Herman Cain with his family and friends laughing at that Trump Tulsa Rally, Death was right next to you and you thought it was important to show the 6% of Black Republican support.  The cost was your life.
Me reading Trump’s tweet about delaying the election, dreading him contesting the results while states—without more funding—count absentee ballots for weeks.
They got Bill Barr to admit that he is willing to use the DOJ on Trump’s behalf to stop states from counting ballots in a contested election, but not much else.  via
The #GDP will still be the worst in American history. Thanks to Trump’s virus.
It's gonna be so important, now that it's clear Trump will contest the legitimacy of any result, for the Dems to win big--beyond a shadow of a doubt. That's why I'm glad we picked an inspiring candidate with an army of dedicated volunteers ready to hit the doors and the phones

Trump did him in and he doesn’t care. More rallies to come!
A president cannot change the date of an election. But he can discredit one, by proposing a change. Trump and his minions are lying awake trying to figure out a way to steal this election away from the democratic will of the American people.
Really? Because every Republican I know and I know a lot, won't wear them. Every idiotic friend I have who loves Trump refuses to wear a mask and even refuses to wash their hands regularly. Because...freedom. Whatever the hell that means.
Proper punctuation was used, and there was sentence structure. Trump is too much of a moron to have written this properly. 🤣
I just keep think, Cain died but Trump is still here?!?!
Too bad the Trump administration didn’t do their job and contain the coronavirus, like countries with competent leaders, like Japan and South Korea.
It is so terrible when anyone loses a life, and C19 is a terrible, painful way to go. It’s a sad reality that many Trump supporters will not learn from this because of the politicization of a deadly virus. Just plain sad.

We know Trump politicizing this pandemic and mask wearing has killed many. Herman Cain's unfortunate death is just the most famous direct case to this presidency's recklessness.
Trump is literally a fucking dictator now .... the UN should invade the US for our own protection, from kidnapping innocent ppl to suggesting an unconstitutional takeover of the government the US sinks deeper into a pit of almost laughable despair
Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can’t win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn’t believe in election results
President Pelosi is trending because you are all the dumbest mother fuckers alive.   1st - If there is no election Pelosi is out of office before Trump  2nd - Trump isn’t going to follow the constitution! He hasn’t done it yet. He will use his secret police to hold power
If trump had made all of the attendees at his rally Herman may still be alive. Maybe not, but his chances would have improved. but eff it, right? Asthma karens can stay home
For Trump's cult, COVID-19 won't be real until someone in their family dies of it. Until then, it's just a hoax, or the flu.
The US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.  And more than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for the 2nd week.  And Trump is busy doing Pizza commercials.

Trump is trying his best to stay in office
There should be only one question that every republican must be bombarded with continuously, do you agree with trump that he can delay the election and will you stop him from trying.
Donald Trump is a Fascist.
Just because trump is trying to distract you today doesn’t mean he won’t use fascist and authoritarian means to hold onto power.  I know the economy is shit. I don’t need today’s numbers to show that.  Trumps threat to delay the election is dangerous and should be taken seriously
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That’s when he does crazy authoritarian things. He’s cornered. And Biden isn’t going to save us.
I mean they can get away with anything people think that has Trump wasn't removed from office that he was innocent of the whole thing
Like President Trump fleeing the draft!There is no way Romney is voting for trump

Presidents affliction. He looks beat. President Trump does not.

You are correct.  Whenever Trump and Putin have a call there is always a moronic decision Trump makes right after.  So predictable.
In an election where the youth vote is critical she would torpedo his chances to win the presidency. Frankly, unless she wants another four years of Trump she should immediately take herself out of the running.
I think it’s because she is a very smart Strong women who is not intimidated by him, but I don’t think any of the Top picks are intimidated by Trump
He asked the right question and pressed for answers, on  Swann said Trump had 8 calls with Putin and never brought up Swann should have asked Trump the question as to why after 8 calls he never brought up
We do have right to mock her for being a reality denying, bigoted moron. Especially since she decided to turn herself into a public figure by repeating Trump's lies about hydroxychloroquine.
What's more mind boggling, is that they think Democrats have that kind of power, yet still somehow allowed Trump to become President in the first place. They're all clowns

Trump firing people who are investigating his crimes is evidence of the fact that he's a criminal; it's not evidence of spying.
I'm not mad that it's not being investigated because there's no reason to believe it happened. This is just a conspiracy theory that Trump spreads to rile up the racist idiots in his personality cult.
Rev Al and BLM not only don't matter, they choose which Black Lives meet the criteria and vote for Dems. Trump loving blacks don't matter, Chicago black kids don't matter, aborted Black babies don't matter...BLM, my ass!
We know it's a lie because 1) there's no evidence for it and 2) Trump is constantly lying.  You lost when you spouted incoherent gibberish in an attempt to defend Trump.

This bigot is more concerned with bigotry being exposed than with the bigotry itself. He's also spammed a tweet complaining about Biden calling out Trump's racism, but he seems perfectly fine with the fact that Trump's a virulent racist.
Judge calls out Trump, Barr DOJ for punishing Cohen over new book  via
Ment to add that Trump makes it insulting.
He’s a Trump ball licker
Oh ok  I thought the reason you wanted to rip down statues of past presidents was because they where racist.    "Trump is the only racist president, there have been past racist candidates, but trump is the only one that was elected"
A check in call from  to Putin to see how Trump is doing pushing the Russian agenda
Yea ok, but I never said that he would or wouldn't.  I said that hilliary and liberals couldn't take the lost still up to this day.  Trump is a good president, weather you like it or not and he will get in 2020.  So don't worry about him loosing
Really Tom, what has Trump and Barr been doing, screw the law
Trump will never again be interviewed by anyone on NBC or MSNBC because he couldn’t survive being made a fool of again
Nope, this is what Trump imagined in his Warped little mind and he is fulfilling his dreams
when there were shootings in Chicago in 2016  trump*: Obama's fault  when there a few Ebola deaths  trump*: Obama’s fault  140,000 dead from COVID. Shootings happening today in Chicago. and elsewhere  trump: “I’m not responsible”
there’s a difference between setting up a temp hospital (done all the time, everywhere, in emergencies) and setting up testing temporary laboratories.  It’s the NATIONWIDE crush of testing that is the problem. Not our local response.  10 day delays, NATIONWIDE? That’s on trump*
So when trump goes over there and saves these city's with the feds.  You'll are still gonna talk shit and cry.  If you want to see America turn into Venezuela, then try living over their for a week.
Let's settle it, let's see who's really gonna win this.    #trump or #Biden
Trumpkins -"but ...he's showing leadership and seriousness in the new covid press conferences."  Trump "person, woman ... man ... ... Camera ... TV"   Keep up the great work  I think you broke his brain
yer boy trump* is doing most of the lying

If you, Guys, in the Trump Administration,  FAIL to stop Réginal Boulos and his ARMED BANDITS from continuing assassinating (POSITION CLOSED!) BLACK PEOPLE IN HAÏTI, you will have reached a point of NO RETURN. It's CRIMINAL!
Well, seeing as I've been publicly called "deplorable" for saying I won't vote for Trump but also likely won't vote for the Dem candidate, this is ahem, unsurprising.
If it’s federal Trump will pardon her and the GOP will just shrug 🤷‍♂️
A perfect fit for the Trump Administration😕
Then he said when asked *specifically* about Biden's education agenda that we don't have the luxury of talking about that because democracy is at stake and Trump is a "Russian Agent", elections have been stolen, and he can't imagine a peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses.I love Trump more after reading this headline.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election, a power designated to Congress
Years ago on interview , Trump said, 'the island was a cesspool'.     He also kicked Epstein out of Mar-a lago.  He was no fan of Epstein.
It'll be Trump supporters starving &amp; GOP will lose the Senate &amp; WH.   You're such a great negotiator. 🤣 Telling someone to starve who is college-educated &amp; has a job in the worst recession we've had since the last RePUKE POTUS crashed the economy. I won't be the one starving.
I also have more bad news posted on Twitter LeBron paid all felons fines so they can vote in Florida! Trump only won by 100000 there are 1million felons voting now in Florida 😩 trump will lose Florida

If you want Trump out of office do not vote for Kanye. I feel like Ye’s sole purpose for this whole campaign is for publicity and to split the black vote between him and Biden. Thats the only way Trump can win this election.
Having only heard bits and bobs on the radio about Trump’s crazy “delay the election” notion, I have to say I’m holding my breath that Republicans (like McConnell and McCarthy) continue to naysay the idea. Enabling such an election delay would enable the end of our democracy.

Plus, 7-% of Trump's are FAKE.
Yeah, that and that it's against the law.  I can't wait until Republicans pull the plug on Trump. It's long overdue.
Wait, not to get involved, but just for clarification, are you saying Trump was joking with that tweet? As marked by the three question marks instead of one question mark, which would note it as a serious tweet???
Is it me? Or has the last 8 months of this dumpster fire year gone by lightning fast but the next 96 days to vote Trump’s punk ass out of office is dragging? Like, you have to wonder if he goes away, will he take this curse away with him?? #VoteTrumpOut2020
Or vote in nov because trump is scared of losing
I agree Mika ! I wish mo harm on anyone regardless of their beliefs ! Trump is the real murderer for doing absolutely nothing !  Calls himself a leader..Never ! He's the joke of the entire world! Maybe he's the Alien DNA ?
Is this them attempting to save face before Trump loses? I don't get it...
Wrong he died from the trump virus
But why do reporters lose their minds on the stupidest questions of trump and the same hacks don’t even ask Biden questions? “Reporters” is a stretch. Just start calling them assholes.
How about less fun and games social hour during a pandemic and more productive pandemic problem solving if Trump can't cut back on his fun and games social hour it just reinforces once again that Donald Trump is a sack of shit
Trump broke me! 😭😭😭😭
Only people that hate Trump would say that like he whipped it up in his own lab or something there truly scum there's no other two ways around it
The closer we get to November 3, the crazier trump and his supporters get. Enemy nations such as Russia are watching and waiting for their opportunity to destroy us.   We must be diligent.

That's why Russia and China are facist more than communist or socialist. They technically aren't either. Authoritarians use communism and socialism to sound legit. Like how NK says DRNP. I personally think it's possible if trump wins a second term to consolidate power
Hey Twitter Pals,lots of talk starting to rumble around about postponing the election, I heard it talked about on  and a lot of tweets today, so constitutional scholars, America voted for trump and pence for one term,so that ends on 1/20/21. No one is re-elected 1/2
Obama and trump were never political oppenants. How are sitting presidents supposed to investigate canidates if there's a suspicion of crime?
Cain was not able to understand the importance of protecting himself from the novel coronavirus, and he paid the ultimate price for it.  He should have never believed Trump’s BS.
Trump is a whole joke !!!!!!! He swears he’s a dictator
the only thing Trump has been focused on is turning Americans against each other by stoking racial tensions and other sinister us VS them topics

Trump did not want to talk about horrendous economic news. Hence the day-long distraction re: election. And too many people bit.
Yeah. Sorry, not flying. He stuck with Trump when his opposition would have made a difference. A real Susan Collins profile in courage.
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
INBOX:  releases statement on  Tweet on delaying election:   "...Trump is sowing confusion about bedrock principles of our democracy to distract from an accelerating pandemic, a massive economic contraction and his campaign’s sinking poll numbers."
I just convinced a trump voter on my FB page!  It took a while but now he understands. I will take that as a win.
Trump: "I'm not joking I never joke around."
So basically nominate Romney 2.0? The Republicans will lose all the obama trump voters.
You would think that even if they're all this evil, the nearly 3 million Trump voters in New York and millions more in other blue states might opt for something better than this.
Maybe if Donald Trump got invited to a funeral he would say something bad too

Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election. Pay attention idiot
I'd agree but let's be honest as to why they're willing to go on record: under Trump, the economy contracted by a third (annualized) and they need a distraction.  Its self preservation by elected Rs, not principle.
I think Trump wants to order food from China.
Wow, Trump’s face looks so bad it looks like Hillary Clinton photoshopped her vagina on it.
Who the fuck writes these pressers for Trump? #idiotsrunningtheshow we don’t believe you simply because you say it.  please wake me from this nightmare.
Trump is posting a classic pre-textual argument. He banned some travel from China because that is his default solution, his knee-jerk response to impending crisis. Find someone to blame and then hurt them.
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You’re a fucking assclown.
this press conference from Trump is a waste of everyone's time because he just spreads lies and misinformation during it causing more harm than good. if you watch it I suggest have your fact checking site ready to check everything he says
wait.. forget everything else.  are you saying that half of all men who exist are trump supporters? i’m pretty sure there are a ton of options out there. also why tf would i want to be with someone who supports such asinine, racist behavior? hard pass

Many rats leaving the ship of Trump today!!
I beg to differ. I’m an elementary school principal, and Trump in no way measures up to any of my fifth graders! Not only that, my students are bilingual, and Trump doesn’t speak any language proficiently.
Dream on. Trump will either make a request that will be denied and he'll cancel or find an "emergency." That tw has nothing left. 150,000 dead Americans, the economy in the toilet with no end in sight. What do you think the death toll will be by then?
If you’re upset about #UI ending &amp; lack of help for state/local &amp; #smallbiz, look no further than Republican infighting. Other nations are handling this crisis, but Trump Admin disarray coupled with GOP-backbiting is leading to surging infection rates, unemployment, &amp; misery.
So we’ve all wondered what it would take for a meaningful number of Republicans to step out in opposition to Trump. Shooting someone in 5th Ave would not be enough. Suggesting that we delay the election apparently is. via
and today, in 2020, "whatever Trump says" became the Republican party's motto.
You think Taliban need incentives to kill our guys?  Use your brain instead of parroting something you "heard".  What do you suppose Trump should do even if true?  Start a war with Russia?
The silent majority is the millions of conservatives who now realize Trump is completely in over his head but don’t speak up because they don’t want to be attacked by Trump’s supporters
Trump has no interest in delaying the election . An on time election helps him out because his base is full of covid deniers who will cough on each other at the polls as a statement of freedom, it’ll be democrats staying home . His only goal is to throw doubt on the outcome
You folks really need to get over yourselves. Some people don't hate Trump. Life goes on.

People without jobs who don't earn big paychecks are being shamed by Trump-Republicans as lazy &amp; undeserving of #unemploymentinsurance during a pandemic. But it's the Trump Admin that should be ashamed for its mishandling of this crisis &amp; for tanking the economy.
what are the odds Trump has ever tried the "Great Pizza!!!"?
Bruh even before trump, when I would see pick up trucks riding around with 2 big ass American flags, I would just like “now I know for a fact they’re racist”
The thing about this horrific sentiment is that reacting to crises first, or even primarily, as PR crises is far from just a Trump admin thing
Trump and Pompeo showing their hand on delaying election may not be constitutional but the message to GOP Governors is clear, do everything you can to interfere with the election process in your state.
Dead from COVID that he caught at a Trump rally...
But will trump apologize?
Every time I post something defending black lives matter my trump side of my family slide up and say some shit, as if i’m gonna read it! 💀
"Ballot harvesting"? I believe that's called "voting." But yay, you! for not going along with Trump's bullshit on this.
I love that these idiots can't quite figure out whether to cling ever-more-tightly to Trump or pretend they've never heard of him.  Doing both seems problematic.
Trump wishes he was half the man Obama is. He's the most dispicable person on this Earth
CNN is currently pursuing today's shiny object by having palpitations over Trump's suggestion that the election could be delayed. Please don't fall for this: report on the atrocious economic numbers, which is what he DOESN'T want people talking about. Thank you.
Hermann Cain, after the Tulsa Rally where he contracted #COVID19:  “The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." RIP.  Needless deaths abound, Trump is guilty of mass murder.
This is the hollow bullshit of a fascist.   Donald Trump directly caused Herman Cain's death.

The GOP every time Trump says something dumb and fascistic:
Which is hilarious considering how the left disparages any minority Trump supporters or any minority Republicans in general while at the same time making an issue about lack of diversity in the GOP. It's a catch-22 for any minority wishing to be Republican.

delaying the election will not pause the pandemic. delaying the election will not make me support trump. delaying the election will not bring back the innocent lives stolen by police brutality. delaying the election will not end sex trafficking. delaying the election won’t work.
This is made so much worse by the era of Trump, when it is so tempting to return to an era when everything was still terrible but the guy in charge was smart and likable.
Let us not getting distracted by Trump. The President is speaking! Tune in!
Why do Trump supporters make supporting Trump their entire personality? Were they really that much of a fucking loser in high school that they finally feel like they fit in? I just don't get it?
We can't make a deal because you spent the WHOLE LAST CARES package ROBBING THE TREASURY WITH YOUR WIFE AND DONALD TRUMP.
We can't make a deal, because instead of helping all the  hurting Americans, you want to make sure no hotels can compete with Donald Trump's hotels.

A president cannot change the date of an election. But he can discredit one, by proposing a change. Trump and his minions are lying awake trying to figure out a way to steal this election away from the democratic will of the American people.
Really? Because every Republican I know and I know a lot, won't wear them. Every idiotic friend I have who loves Trump refuses to wear a mask and even refuses to wash their hands regularly. Because...freedom. Whatever the hell that means.
Proper punctuation was used, and there was sentence structure. Trump is too much of a moron to have written this properly. 🤣
I just keep think, Cain died but Trump is still here?!?!
Too bad the Trump administration didn’t do their job and contain the coronavirus, like countries with competent leaders, like Japan and South Korea.

Trump is literally a fucking dictator now .... the UN should invade the US for our own protection, from kidnapping innocent ppl to suggesting an unconstitutional takeover of the government the US sinks deeper into a pit of almost laughable despair
Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can’t win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn’t believe in election results
President Pelosi is trending because you are all the dumbest mother fuckers alive.   1st - If there is no election Pelosi is out of office before Trump  2nd - Trump isn’t going to follow the constitution! He hasn’t done it yet. He will use his secret police to hold power
If trump had made all of the attendees at his rally Herman may still be alive. Maybe not, but his chances would have improved. but eff it, right? Asthma karens can stay home
NICE TRY ....  Delaying the elections in November was So Predictable...  Trump is going down.... voted out and left to the ash heap of history as a president that killed tens of thousands of Americans all for his re-election
For Trump's cult, COVID-19 won't be real until someone in their family dies of it. Until then, it's just a hoax, or the flu.
Herman Cain presumably contracted the corona virus at the Trump rally in Tulsa, he is now dead.  Republicans will completely ignore that shit..
The US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.  And more than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for the 2nd week.  And Trump is busy doing Pizza commercials.

Donald Trump is a Fascist.
Just because trump is trying to distract you today doesn’t mean he won’t use fascist and authoritarian means to hold onto power.  I know the economy is shit. I don’t need today’s numbers to show that.  Trumps threat to delay the election is dangerous and should be taken seriously
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That’s when he does crazy authoritarian things. He’s cornered. And Biden isn’t going to save us.
I mean they can get away with anything people think that has Trump wasn't removed from office that he was innocent of the whole thing

Lincoln did not delay the elections during the Civil War.  FDR did not delay the elections during WWII  Trump raises idea of delaying election -
Like the Trump effect.  Every attack on him appears to backfire.
Trump is an authoritarian who has deployed federal troops to attack peaceful protestors and veterans. He is now threatening to cancel the election. This isn’t admitting he is weak, it’s using his ability to steamroll everyone as a way to hold onto power. With force if he can
Trump wants to delay the election but can’t delay the school year? smh
it tells you everything you need to know about Jeb and the other lickspittles.  Despite Trump's trashing of our respect, our dignity, our norms, our Constitution, our economy, our health ... they still support him.  Won't utter a word of criticism.  It's disgusting.

It'll be Trump supporters starving &amp; GOP will lose the Senate &amp; WH.   You're such a great negotiator. 🤣 Telling someone to starve who is college-educated &amp; has a job in the worst recession we've had since the last RePUKE POTUS crashed the economy. I won't be the one starving.

If you want Trump out of office do not vote for Kanye. I feel like Ye’s sole purpose for this whole campaign is for publicity and to split the black vote between him and Biden. Thats the only way Trump can win this election.

Yeah, that and that it's against the law.  I can't wait until Republicans pull the plug on Trump. It's long overdue.
Wait, not to get involved, but just for clarification, are you saying Trump was joking with that tweet? As marked by the three question marks instead of one question mark, which would note it as a serious tweet???
Or vote in nov because trump is scared of losing
Wrong he died from the trump virus
But why do reporters lose their minds on the stupidest questions of trump and the same hacks don’t even ask Biden questions? “Reporters” is a stretch. Just start calling them assholes.
How about less fun and games social hour during a pandemic and more productive pandemic problem solving if Trump can't cut back on his fun and games social hour it just reinforces once again that Donald Trump is a sack of shit
Trump broke me! 😭😭😭😭
The closer we get to November 3, the crazier trump and his supporters get. Enemy nations such as Russia are watching and waiting for their opportunity to destroy us.   We must be diligent.

EPIC FAIL: Donald Trump crashes the economy and then floats postponing the election.
This 💩 continues until President Trump is elected again.
I just deleted my reply to you because I see you are a trump fanboy and probably wouldn’t understand an intelligent reply.
That's why Russia and China are facist more than communist or socialist. They technically aren't either. Authoritarians use communism and socialism to sound legit. Like how NK says DRNP. I personally think it's possible if trump wins a second term to consolidate power
Hey Twitter Pals,lots of talk starting to rumble around about postponing the election, I heard it talked about on  and a lot of tweets today, so constitutional scholars, America voted for trump and pence for one term,so that ends on 1/20/21. No one is re-elected 1/2
Obama and trump were never political oppenants. How are sitting presidents supposed to investigate canidates if there's a suspicion of crime?
Cain was not able to understand the importance of protecting himself from the novel coronavirus, and he paid the ultimate price for it.  He should have never believed Trump’s BS.
Trump is a whole joke !!!!!!! He swears he’s a dictator
the only thing Trump has been focused on is turning Americans against each other by stoking racial tensions and other sinister us VS them topics

Not true. I’m sure Trump will vote for himself.

Trump did not want to talk about horrendous economic news. Hence the day-long distraction re: election. And too many people bit.
Yeah. Sorry, not flying. He stuck with Trump when his opposition would have made a difference. A real Susan Collins profile in courage.
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
INBOX:  releases statement on  Tweet on delaying election:   "...Trump is sowing confusion about bedrock principles of our democracy to distract from an accelerating pandemic, a massive economic contraction and his campaign’s sinking poll numbers."
I just convinced a trump voter on my FB page!  It took a while but now he understands. I will take that as a win.
Trump: "I'm not joking I never joke around."
So basically nominate Romney 2.0? The Republicans will lose all the obama trump voters.
You would think that even if they're all this evil, the nearly 3 million Trump voters in New York and millions more in other blue states might opt for something better than this.
Maybe if Donald Trump got invited to a funeral he would say something bad too

Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election. Pay attention idiot
I'd agree but let's be honest as to why they're willing to go on record: under Trump, the economy contracted by a third (annualized) and they need a distraction.  Its self preservation by elected Rs, not principle.
I think Trump wants to order food from China.
Wow, Trump’s face looks so bad it looks like Hillary Clinton photoshopped her vagina on it.
Who the fuck writes these pressers for Trump? #idiotsrunningtheshow we don’t believe you simply because you say it.  please wake me from this nightmare.
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You’re a fucking assclown.
this press conference from Trump is a waste of everyone's time because he just spreads lies and misinformation during it causing more harm than good. if you watch it I suggest have your fact checking site ready to check everything he says
wait.. forget everything else.  are you saying that half of all men who exist are trump supporters? i’m pretty sure there are a ton of options out there. also why tf would i want to be with someone who supports such asinine, racist behavior? hard pass

I beg to differ. I’m an elementary school principal, and Trump in no way measures up to any of my fifth graders! Not only that, my students are bilingual, and Trump doesn’t speak any language proficiently.
Look where that got Trump.
thank God for AG Bar. , For. Taken all this scum out.  TRUMP 2o2o.  December is around the corner. People had enough from this demorats socialist communists.            Keep up the 👍 good work.
Neither. This is Trump trying to normalize the idea of moving the election, which he will attempt to do.
Dream on. Trump will either make a request that will be denied and he'll cancel or find an "emergency." That tw has nothing left. 150,000 dead Americans, the economy in the toilet with no end in sight. What do you think the death toll will be by then?
If you’re upset about #UI ending &amp; lack of help for state/local &amp; #smallbiz, look no further than Republican infighting. Other nations are handling this crisis, but Trump Admin disarray coupled with GOP-backbiting is leading to surging infection rates, unemployment, &amp; misery.
So we’ve all wondered what it would take for a meaningful number of Republicans to step out in opposition to Trump. Shooting someone in 5th Ave would not be enough. Suggesting that we delay the election apparently is. via
and today, in 2020, "whatever Trump says" became the Republican party's motto.
You think Taliban need incentives to kill our guys?  Use your brain instead of parroting something you "heard".  What do you suppose Trump should do even if true?  Start a war with Russia?
The silent majority is the millions of conservatives who now realize Trump is completely in over his head but don’t speak up because they don’t want to be attacked by Trump’s supporters
Trump has no interest in delaying the election . An on time election helps him out because his base is full of covid deniers who will cough on each other at the polls as a statement of freedom, it’ll be democrats staying home . His only goal is to throw doubt on the outcome
You folks really need to get over yourselves. Some people don't hate Trump. Life goes on.

i would love for someone to ask Trump why Americans can't travel to Russia
People without jobs who don't earn big paychecks are being shamed by Trump-Republicans as lazy &amp; undeserving of #unemploymentinsurance during a pandemic. But it's the Trump Admin that should be ashamed for its mishandling of this crisis &amp; for tanking the economy.
what are the odds Trump has ever tried the "Great Pizza!!!"?
Bruh even before trump, when I would see pick up trucks riding around with 2 big ass American flags, I would just like “now I know for a fact they’re racist”
The thing about this horrific sentiment is that reacting to crises first, or even primarily, as PR crises is far from just a Trump admin thing
Trump and Pompeo showing their hand on delaying election may not be constitutional but the message to GOP Governors is clear, do everything you can to interfere with the election process in your state.
Dead from COVID that he caught at a Trump rally...
Every time I post something defending black lives matter my trump side of my family slide up and say some shit, as if i’m gonna read it! 💀
"Ballot harvesting"? I believe that's called "voting." But yay, you! for not going along with Trump's bullshit on this.
I love that these idiots can't quite figure out whether to cling ever-more-tightly to Trump or pretend they've never heard of him.  Doing both seems problematic.
CNN is currently pursuing today's shiny object by having palpitations over Trump's suggestion that the election could be delayed. Please don't fall for this: report on the atrocious economic numbers, which is what he DOESN'T want people talking about. Thank you.
Hermann Cain, after the Tulsa Rally where he contracted #COVID19:  “The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." RIP.  Needless deaths abound, Trump is guilty of mass murder.
This is the hollow bullshit of a fascist.   Donald Trump directly caused Herman Cain's death.
Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after contracting Covid. Not clear when/where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than 2 wks after attending Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa in June. Co-chair of Black Voices for Trump.

The GOP every time Trump says something dumb and fascistic:
Which is hilarious considering how the left disparages any minority Trump supporters or any minority Republicans in general while at the same time making an issue about lack of diversity in the GOP. It's a catch-22 for any minority wishing to be Republican.

Why do Trump supporters make supporting Trump their entire personality? Were they really that much of a fucking loser in high school that they finally feel like they fit in? I just don't get it?
We can't make a deal because you spent the WHOLE LAST CARES package ROBBING THE TREASURY WITH YOUR WIFE AND DONALD TRUMP.

I think Trump doesn't think he will win this election!. I would have been more convinced to postpone if he said he's worried about increased #COVID19  cases; he wanted to #FlattenTheCurve but no, he's worried about an inaccurate election.

Remember a couple of weeks ago when I said that Coronavirus has both delivered the biggest blow to Trump's chances of reelection and, simultaneously, given him the best and easiest path to steal the presidency in November?  … yeah.
I’m watching videos of Herman Cain with his family and friends laughing at that Trump Tulsa Rally, Death was right next to you and you thought it was important to show the 6% of Black Republican support.  The cost was your life.
Me reading Trump’s tweet about delaying the election, dreading him contesting the results while states—without more funding—count absentee ballots for weeks.
They got Bill Barr to admit that he is willing to use the DOJ on Trump’s behalf to stop states from counting ballots in a contested election, but not much else.  via
The #GDP will still be the worst in American history. Thanks to Trump’s virus.
It's gonna be so important, now that it's clear Trump will contest the legitimacy of any result, for the Dems to win big--beyond a shadow of a doubt. That's why I'm glad we picked an inspiring candidate with an army of dedicated volunteers ready to hit the doors and the phones

A president cannot change the date of an election. But he can discredit one, by proposing a change. Trump and his minions are lying awake trying to figure out a way to steal this election away from the democratic will of the American people.
Really? Because every Republican I know and I know a lot, won't wear them. Every idiotic friend I have who loves Trump refuses to wear a mask and even refuses to wash their hands regularly. Because...freedom. Whatever the hell that means.
Proper punctuation was used, and there was sentence structure. Trump is too much of a moron to have written this properly. 🤣
I just keep think, Cain died but Trump is still here?!?!
Too bad the Trump administration didn’t do their job and contain the coronavirus, like countries with competent leaders, like Japan and South Korea.
It is so terrible when anyone loses a life, and C19 is a terrible, painful way to go. It’s a sad reality that many Trump supporters will not learn from this because of the politicization of a deadly virus. Just plain sad.
Then Nancy Pelosi will be sworn in on January 20th. Transfer of Power is in the constitution. Trump's &amp; Pence's term is over and Speaker of the House is next in line. The end.  Congress is trying to get funding for vote by mail.

We know Trump politicizing this pandemic and mask wearing has killed many. Herman Cain's unfortunate death is just the most famous direct case to this presidency's recklessness.
Trump is literally a fucking dictator now .... the UN should invade the US for our own protection, from kidnapping innocent ppl to suggesting an unconstitutional takeover of the government the US sinks deeper into a pit of almost laughable despair
Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can’t win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn’t believe in election results
President Pelosi is trending because you are all the dumbest mother fuckers alive.   1st - If there is no election Pelosi is out of office before Trump  2nd - Trump isn’t going to follow the constitution! He hasn’t done it yet. He will use his secret police to hold power
If trump had made all of the attendees at his rally Herman may still be alive. Maybe not, but his chances would have improved. but eff it, right? Asthma karens can stay home
For Trump's cult, COVID-19 won't be real until someone in their family dies of it. Until then, it's just a hoax, or the flu.
The US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.  And more than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for the 2nd week.  And Trump is busy doing Pizza commercials.

There should be only one question that every republican must be bombarded with continuously, do you agree with trump that he can delay the election and will you stop him from trying.
Donald Trump is a Fascist.
Just because trump is trying to distract you today doesn’t mean he won’t use fascist and authoritarian means to hold onto power.  I know the economy is shit. I don’t need today’s numbers to show that.  Trumps threat to delay the election is dangerous and should be taken seriously
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That’s when he does crazy authoritarian things. He’s cornered. And Biden isn’t going to save us.
I mean they can get away with anything people think that has Trump wasn't removed from office that he was innocent of the whole thing
Like President Trump fleeing the draft!
Like the Trump effect.  Every attack on him appears to backfire.
Trump is an authoritarian who has deployed federal troops to attack peaceful protestors and veterans. He is now threatening to cancel the election. This isn’t admitting he is weak, it’s using his ability to steamroll everyone as a way to hold onto power. With force if he can
Trump wants to delay the election but can’t delay the school year? smh
it tells you everything you need to know about Jeb and the other lickspittles.  Despite Trump's trashing of our respect, our dignity, our norms, our Constitution, our economy, our health ... they still support him.  Won't utter a word of criticism.  It's disgusting.

Twitter never fails to expose the people behind the reason Donald Trump is now, and will be president for four more years. Well done, people. Stay obnoxious, it's working.
You don't get a free pass for following illegal orders.  They know what they are doing is wrong.  Too many of them enjoy hurting fellow citizens.  It's beyond racism, it's become tribal, us vs. them.  They absolutely have become stormtroopers under Barr who is Trump's Hans Frank
If you dont think he's going to fight this to the Supreme Court if Biden wins, you don't know Trump.
The republicans used to be a lot more coy about it and wouldn't admit that they were intentionally reducing voter participation to help them win. But trump has admited it by saying if we allow mail in voting they'll lose the repub party. That's not cuz ppl will vote illegally
... there’s little reason to believe Trump can win short of massive voter suppression and outright fraud. Those are the real worries, not Biden or some magical Trump turnaround.
Every one of these doomsday columns reads exactly like every one of these doomsday columns. Trump is uniquely awful and dangerous. This election is 99% about Trump, who is incapable of doing anything positive to help his own cause. Sure, anything can happen, but ...
Do you really think Trump will do ANYTHING to address this concern?
An even greater threat may be Trump's claim without proof of vote by mail ballot fraud and the current deployment of Federal agents to big cities being onset of more troops to large urban cities to suppress minority voting.I love Trump more after reading this headline.

Mikey no nuts.....you’re right!  Very clear.  Choose the guy who didn’t botch Corona and didn’t allow peaceful protests to get out of control.  Disagree? Cool.  Cry about it.  #Pence #Trump #Biden #COVID #Coronavirus #USA

Alabama’s first game is cancelled.  Member when Trump supporters stormed the Michigan state house with guns, threatening to behead the governor?  All that happened on who’s watch Laura?  You’re such a fucking hack.
Watching the  town hall. I can’t say enough how much I appreciate their commitment and energy to send trump packing. Thank you Lincoln projects
You don’t know what we’re talking s out do you? Allan’s model predicted a trump win in 2016
What’s worse the fact that your created this page because trump rejected you? Or like this shit
I love Trump more now.
This isn't news shouldn't we be talkin about how Donald Trump drinks a glass of water
Plus, 7-% of Trump's are FAKE.
Yeah, that and that it's against the law.  I can't wait until Republicans pull the plug on Trump. It's long overdue.
Wait, not to get involved, but just for clarification, are you saying Trump was joking with that tweet? As marked by the three question marks instead of one question mark, which would note it as a serious tweet???
Is it me? Or has the last 8 months of this dumpster fire year gone by lightning fast but the next 96 days to vote Trump’s punk ass out of office is dragging? Like, you have to wonder if he goes away, will he take this curse away with him?? #VoteTrumpOut2020
Or vote in nov because trump is scared of losing
I agree Mika ! I wish mo harm on anyone regardless of their beliefs ! Trump is the real murderer for doing absolutely nothing !  Calls himself a leader..Never ! He's the joke of the entire world! Maybe he's the Alien DNA ?
Is this them attempting to save face before Trump loses? I don't get it...
Wrong he died from the trump virus
But why do reporters lose their minds on the stupidest questions of trump and the same hacks don’t even ask Biden questions? “Reporters” is a stretch. Just start calling them assholes.
How about less fun and games social hour during a pandemic and more productive pandemic problem solving if Trump can't cut back on his fun and games social hour it just reinforces once again that Donald Trump is a sack of shit
Trump broke me! 😭😭😭😭
Only people that hate Trump would say that like he whipped it up in his own lab or something there truly scum there's no other two ways around it
The closer we get to November 3, the crazier trump and his supporters get. Enemy nations such as Russia are watching and waiting for their opportunity to destroy us.   We must be diligent.
Trump every day.
EPIC FAIL: Donald Trump crashes the economy and then floats postponing the election.
This 💩 continues until President Trump is elected again.
I just deleted my reply to you because I see you are a trump fanboy and probably wouldn’t understand an intelligent reply.
Today II had no time for a little Trump Tantrum! My attention  was on  a Great Man, John Lewis!
That's why Russia and China are facist more than communist or socialist. They technically aren't either. Authoritarians use communism and socialism to sound legit. Like how NK says DRNP. I personally think it's possible if trump wins a second term to consolidate power
Hey Twitter Pals,lots of talk starting to rumble around about postponing the election, I heard it talked about on  and a lot of tweets today, so constitutional scholars, America voted for trump and pence for one term,so that ends on 1/20/21. No one is re-elected 1/2
Obama and trump were never political oppenants. How are sitting presidents supposed to investigate canidates if there's a suspicion of crime?
Cain was not able to understand the importance of protecting himself from the novel coronavirus, and he paid the ultimate price for it.  He should have never believed Trump’s BS.
Trump is a whole joke !!!!!!! He swears he’s a dictator
the only thing Trump has been focused on is turning Americans against each other by stoking racial tensions and other sinister us VS them topics

Not true. I’m sure Trump will vote for himself.

Trump did not want to talk about horrendous economic news. Hence the day-long distraction re: election. And too many people bit.
Yeah. Sorry, not flying. He stuck with Trump when his opposition would have made a difference. A real Susan Collins profile in courage.
Silly  doesn't know the difference  Absentee ballots are cast for Trump by billionaire New York tax evaders with a residence in Florida and are GOOD  Mail-in votes are cast for Biden by normal people who don't like fascism and dying at the polls, and they're BAD
INBOX:  releases statement on  Tweet on delaying election:   "...Trump is sowing confusion about bedrock principles of our democracy to distract from an accelerating pandemic, a massive economic contraction and his campaign’s sinking poll numbers."
I just convinced a trump voter on my FB page!  It took a while but now he understands. I will take that as a win.
Trump: "I'm not joking I never joke around."
So basically nominate Romney 2.0? The Republicans will lose all the obama trump voters.
You would think that even if they're all this evil, the nearly 3 million Trump voters in New York and millions more in other blue states might opt for something better than this.
Maybe if Donald Trump got invited to a funeral he would say something bad too

Trump is a lying
Why Trump Has No Power to Postpone the 2020 Election. Pay attention idiot
Trump won't do a good damn thing
I'd agree but let's be honest as to why they're willing to go on record: under Trump, the economy contracted by a third (annualized) and they need a distraction.  Its self preservation by elected Rs, not principle.
I think Trump wants to order food from China.
Wow, Trump’s face looks so bad it looks like Hillary Clinton photoshopped her vagina on it.
Who the fuck writes these pressers for Trump? #idiotsrunningtheshow we don’t believe you simply because you say it.  please wake me from this nightmare.
Trump is posting a classic pre-textual argument. He banned some travel from China because that is his default solution, his knee-jerk response to impending crisis. Find someone to blame and then hurt them.
Biden sounded smoother the other day, than Trump ever has in front of a mic.  You’re a fucking assclown.
this press conference from Trump is a waste of everyone's time because he just spreads lies and misinformation during it causing more harm than good. if you watch it I suggest have your fact checking site ready to check everything he says
wait.. forget everything else.  are you saying that half of all men who exist are trump supporters? i’m pretty sure there are a ton of options out there. also why tf would i want to be with someone who supports such asinine, racist behavior? hard pass

I beg to differ. I’m an elementary school principal, and Trump in no way measures up to any of my fifth graders! Not only that, my students are bilingual, and Trump doesn’t speak any language proficiently.
Look where that got Trump.
thank God for AG Bar. , For. Taken all this scum out.  TRUMP 2o2o.  December is around the corner. People had enough from this demorats socialist communists.            Keep up the 👍 good work.
Neither. This is Trump trying to normalize the idea of moving the election, which he will attempt to do.
Dream on. Trump will either make a request that will be denied and he'll cancel or find an "emergency." That tw has nothing left. 150,000 dead Americans, the economy in the toilet with no end in sight. What do you think the death toll will be by then?
If you’re upset about #UI ending &amp; lack of help for state/local &amp; #smallbiz, look no further than Republican infighting. Other nations are handling this crisis, but Trump Admin disarray coupled with GOP-backbiting is leading to surging infection rates, unemployment, &amp; misery.
So we’ve all wondered what it would take for a meaningful number of Republicans to step out in opposition to Trump. Shooting someone in 5th Ave would not be enough. Suggesting that we delay the election apparently is. via
and today, in 2020, "whatever Trump says" became the Republican party's motto.
You think Taliban need incentives to kill our guys?  Use your brain instead of parroting something you "heard".  What do you suppose Trump should do even if true?  Start a war with Russia?
The silent majority is the millions of conservatives who now realize Trump is completely in over his head but don’t speak up because they don’t want to be attacked by Trump’s supporters
Trump has no interest in delaying the election . An on time election helps him out because his base is full of covid deniers who will cough on each other at the polls as a statement of freedom, it’ll be democrats staying home . His only goal is to throw doubt on the outcome
You folks really need to get over yourselves. Some people don't hate Trump. Life goes on.

People without jobs who don't earn big paychecks are being shamed by Trump-Republicans as lazy &amp; undeserving of #unemploymentinsurance during a pandemic. But it's the Trump Admin that should be ashamed for its mishandling of this crisis &amp; for tanking the economy.
what are the odds Trump has ever tried the "Great Pizza!!!"?
Bruh even before trump, when I would see pick up trucks riding around with 2 big ass American flags, I would just like “now I know for a fact they’re racist”
The thing about this horrific sentiment is that reacting to crises first, or even primarily, as PR crises is far from just a Trump admin thing
Trump and Pompeo showing their hand on delaying election may not be constitutional but the message to GOP Governors is clear, do everything you can to interfere with the election process in your state.
Dead from COVID that he caught at a Trump rally...

I love that these idiots can't quite figure out whether to cling ever-more-tightly to Trump or pretend they've never heard of him.  Doing both seems problematic.
Trump wishes he was half the man Obama is. He's the most dispicable person on this Earth
CNN is currently pursuing today's shiny object by having palpitations over Trump's suggestion that the election could be delayed. Please don't fall for this: report on the atrocious economic numbers, which is what he DOESN'T want people talking about. Thank you.
Hermann Cain, after the Tulsa Rally where he contracted #COVID19:  “The media worked very hard to scare people out of attending the Trump campaign rally last Saturday night in Tulsa." RIP.  Needless deaths abound, Trump is guilty of mass murder.
This is the hollow bullshit of a fascist.   Donald Trump directly caused Herman Cain's death.
Former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after contracting Covid. Not clear when/where he was infected, but he was hospitalized less than 2 wks after attending Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa in June. Co-chair of Black Voices for Trump.

The GOP every time Trump says something dumb and fascistic:
Which is hilarious considering how the left disparages any minority Trump supporters or any minority Republicans in general while at the same time making an issue about lack of diversity in the GOP. It's a catch-22 for any minority wishing to be Republican.

delaying the election will not pause the pandemic. delaying the election will not make me support trump. delaying the election will not bring back the innocent lives stolen by police brutality. delaying the election will not end sex trafficking. delaying the election won’t work.
This is made so much worse by the era of Trump, when it is so tempting to return to an era when everything was still terrible but the guy in charge was smart and likable.

We can't make a deal because you spent the WHOLE LAST CARES package ROBBING THE TREASURY WITH YOUR WIFE AND DONALD TRUMP.

Statement by Secretary of State  on President Trump’s Disinformation about Elections
I think Trump doesn't think he will win this election!. I would have been more convinced to postpone if he said he's worried about increased #COVID19  cases; he wanted to #FlattenTheCurve but no, he's worried about an inaccurate election.

Remember a couple of weeks ago when I said that Coronavirus has both delivered the biggest blow to Trump's chances of reelection and, simultaneously, given him the best and easiest path to steal the presidency in November?  … yeah.
I’m watching videos of Herman Cain with his family and friends laughing at that Trump Tulsa Rally, Death was right next to you and you thought it was important to show the 6% of Black Republican support.  The cost was your life.
Me reading Trump’s tweet about delaying the election, dreading him contesting the results while states—without more funding—count absentee ballots for weeks.

The #GDP will still be the worst in American history. Thanks to Trump’s virus.
It's gonna be so important, now that it's clear Trump will contest the legitimacy of any result, for the Dems to win big--beyond a shadow of a doubt. That's why I'm glad we picked an inspiring candidate with an army of dedicated volunteers ready to hit the doors and the phones

A president cannot change the date of an election. But he can discredit one, by proposing a change. Trump and his minions are lying awake trying to figure out a way to steal this election away from the democratic will of the American people.
Really? Because every Republican I know and I know a lot, won't wear them. Every idiotic friend I have who loves Trump refuses to wear a mask and even refuses to wash their hands regularly. Because...freedom. Whatever the hell that means.
Proper punctuation was used, and there was sentence structure. Trump is too much of a moron to have written this properly. 🤣
I just keep think, Cain died but Trump is still here?!?!
Too bad the Trump administration didn’t do their job and contain the coronavirus, like countries with competent leaders, like Japan and South Korea.
It is so terrible when anyone loses a life, and C19 is a terrible, painful way to go. It’s a sad reality that many Trump supporters will not learn from this because of the politicization of a deadly virus. Just plain sad.
Then Nancy Pelosi will be sworn in on January 20th. Transfer of Power is in the constitution. Trump's &amp; Pence's term is over and Speaker of the House is next in line. The end.  Congress is trying to get funding for vote by mail.

We know Trump politicizing this pandemic and mask wearing has killed many. Herman Cain's unfortunate death is just the most famous direct case to this presidency's recklessness.
Trump is literally a fucking dictator now .... the UN should invade the US for our own protection, from kidnapping innocent ppl to suggesting an unconstitutional takeover of the government the US sinks deeper into a pit of almost laughable despair
Lol Trump suggesting election delay is just his way of firing ppl up to disbelieve the results. If he can’t win at least he can hand Biden an ever more severely fucked up country who doesn’t believe in election results
President Pelosi is trending because you are all the dumbest mother fuckers alive.   1st - If there is no election Pelosi is out of office before Trump  2nd - Trump isn’t going to follow the constitution! He hasn’t done it yet. He will use his secret police to hold power
If trump had made all of the attendees at his rally Herman may still be alive. Maybe not, but his chances would have improved. but eff it, right? Asthma karens can stay home
Trump literally killed Herman Cain.
NICE TRY ....  Delaying the elections in November was So Predictable...  Trump is going down.... voted out and left to the ash heap of history as a president that killed tens of thousands of Americans all for his re-election
For Trump's cult, COVID-19 won't be real until someone in their family dies of it. Until then, it's just a hoax, or the flu.
Herman Cain presumably contracted the corona virus at the Trump rally in Tulsa, he is now dead.  Republicans will completely ignore that shit..
The US GDP fell by 32.9% in the 2nd quarter. The largest recorded drop in history.  And more than 1.43M people filed for unemployment benefits for the 1st time last week, rising for the 2nd week.  And Trump is busy doing Pizza commercials.

Just because trump is trying to distract you today doesn’t mean he won’t use fascist and authoritarian means to hold onto power.  I know the economy is shit. I don’t need today’s numbers to show that.  Trumps threat to delay the election is dangerous and should be taken seriously
Thank you.  Seeing libs tweeting about how this is trump admitting he is weak or losing.   So?!?! That’s when he does crazy authoritarian things. He’s cornered. And Biden isn’t going to save us.

Every one of these doomsday columns reads exactly like every one of these doomsday columns. Trump is uniquely awful and dangerous. This election is 99% about Trump, who is incapable of doing anything positive to help his own cause. Sure, anything can happen, but ...
Do you really think Trump will do ANYTHING to address this concern?
An even greater threat may be Trump's claim without proof of vote by mail ballot fraud and the current deployment of Federal agents to big cities being onset of more troops to large urban cities to suppress minority voting.
Trump is clearly not healthy enough to serve four years. He's certainly going away if he loses. The GOP will dump him. #TrumpIsNotWell
NO MORE Trump! He makes me sick. Every. Fucking. Day. Come do your thing #Karma.  People are dying. The economy sucks. He fucked up &amp; failed us all. #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
If Trump’s racist dog whistle had mentioned "white trash", you might have a valid point.  But, you know, that's his base.
3. Trump launches "Embers Strategy"  #axiosam
This election won't be decided on November 4th, especially if Biden supporters choose vote by mail. We have to understand that first while we see this play out. It is highly likely that when we go to bed, Trump will be leading, and even more likley that on November 11th he won't
Exactly. Alot of people have no idea that facism was a slow game. It took almost a decade for Hitler to rise to public view, then to political power. Then another decade for him to consolidate political power and public support to become a dictator. Trump is pre deathcamps
can't wait for you TO BE GONE!  HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ? HOW DO YOU GO HOME TO FACE YOUR NEIGHBOURS? NEXT TO TRUMP, MOST HATED MAN IN WASHINGTON
Actually, the one on the top right looks like 80% of the women in the Trump administration.
actually points this out that it's easy to prove he's at his courses but hard to prove he's actually golfing since he is so secretive about it. But they have reporters watch and keep count and supposedly they have evidence trump golfed more than obama
This as helps Susan Collins as much as that one GOP candidate’s ad about his challenger’s terrible secret...that he’s a Democrat.  Collins should clutch her pearls, say Trump has learned his lesson without any punishment, and resign.  Gideon‘ll work for the people. Collins won’t.
I feel the same way every time I hear Trump’s once or read his tweet.
Trump isn't healthy enough to serve four more years. So if he wins, then what?  President Jared Kushner. VP Ivanka.
Do you think it’s funny to mock &amp; smear Dr Fauci? Or mock &amp; those who wear masks?  I DON’T.   Physicians prescribe medicine after speaking w/the patient/family. Trump &amp; misfits have NO say in what a physician prescribes for a patient. NONE  #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #MaskItOrCasket
So the Obama years were worse than Trump’s shitshow?
Maybe, but that is clearly the dog whistle signal in Trump’s statement.  Now, if he meant "white trash" then maybe you've got something there.  But that's his base, you know.
President Trump and Dir. Wolf said they aren't leaving.
Oh yeah forgot trump owns the Johnston industrial park. via /r/RhodeIsland  #rhodeisland #littlerhody #oceanstate
What's Soo sad about this whole thing is Trump is doing it because Putin asked him to. Trump is a fucking traitor
Why?  does NOT need to do that. Economic tariffs on goods made in China is crushing their economy. Trump also has stopped China dumping cheap steel in the US or Canada, as they were dumping it in Canada, as a means to move it into the US.
When you see republicans passing out money like candy you know they want trump to fail! sneaks!!! poor trump just wasn't wise to these RATS😠
Bad optics trump 😩
This the trump I love❤️
Don't make me laugh gop is joke ! Trump just couldn't pick an AG worth anything 😩
- black person is murdered by police - people protest that murder and its accompaniment of countless others under a racist system - more police brutality insues, president sends in unidentified agents to join - white people make it about them sticking it to trump
What's nice is President Trump passed "The Right to Try" E.O.
There are phrases which are true at all moments: “Yes, I do want ice cream.” or “Dave Matthews Band has a new album.” and even “The Trump administration decided to move forward with the decision yesterday, a move which has received bipartisan criticism.”
Absolutely Not.  I will NOT be voting for Donald Trump
In my previous tweet I said could they hate that deeply I don’t mean for Trump I mean for the United States of America the press hates our great country
Here is Another Geography Question for You ,. Mr Trump.  Since you're the President of The Great United States... you should Easily know the Answer to THIS Easy Question. : Which U.S. State has both of these towns Located Within its borders ? Lee
Really??? Wow I can't even imagine what that would do ! I think all bets are off ! Trump will make it a Hugh Campaign issue if he's blocked to pick a replacement !
Are you listening Trump base?
Trump Inc was pretty great when it launched. Its more recent episodes are current events but the first few are deep dives into the Trump organization finances
97 days until the presidential election.  Another reason why I oppose Donald Trump’s re-election. Reason #97: Because he is racist.
I don't know about you mitchie boy 😩? I am not sure where you stand on we the people or trump it anything but I got a gut feeling you're a back stabbing sob out if touch fucking asshole trump hater did I get it all?

Good evening Mr Trump.  How are things in MINNIANAPOLIS  ??
Dude grow the hell up....if he was actually a child molester, Republicans would have definitely put that out there when Obama was running for President. They r trying 2 throw everything under the sun 2 beat him.  Military USED 2 be behind republicans until trump came along. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Do you really think we trust Trump &amp; Abbot's numbers?  NOT. A. CHANCE.
Hmmmm very strange the way cases started going down the literal day Trump diverted the CDC data to the White House.  So strange . . .

These people are getting paid MILLION$, &amp; GOPigs are IRRESPONSIBLE &amp; won't wear masks, so why do you think they would OK players going to church?  Always looking for someone to BLAME.  Perhaps if Trump had been more responsible to begin with, we wouldn't be dealing with this now.

Your entire existence has been consumed by hatred of Donald John Trump.  Worth it?
That’s Trump’s daughter! Stupid
one thing I did not consider as a worst case scenario in 2016 was that trump might fuck up so badly that the entire country would become horribly and insufferably online
Does the Guardian work for you?
CNN hack! You never voted for Trump!
Reminder that Trump was so racist about redlining that the *Nixon Administration* hauled him into court:
Oh, but that was going to happen after the 2016 election... Trump was going to “lock them up”.  It’s SO ODD that the only ones getting locked  up have been connected to Trump, his campaign, and his admin.  But you keep wishing and dreaming. Trump is terrified. And SHOULD be.
The Trump Administration.
The Left needs to worker harder both to take space in the Uighur solidarity movement away from cynical right wingers, who will (and in Trump's case already have) betray them. /7

And there is no chance that Trump will attempt to contest the count, and that Biden’s popular-vote margin will be important in securing the legitimacy of a win against any such attempts?
What day do y’all think trump is calling us the n-word, my guess is October 23.

NIMBY racism is real but it’s more subtle than Trump thinks; ironically, stuff like this might make it less tenable in a lot of places

I am voting to re elect Donald Trump for president... I am voting Republican across-the-board to get  rid of all the demonic democrats And to save America... people like you don't have a clue.
Want to get angry, annoyed, and a stress headache for free?? Read Trump’s tweets + comment section
Contrary to what news outlet of your choice is peddling, trump just said that fed agents are t leaving Portland til wheeler and company aid in establishing law and order . If the Dems don’t want to remove the bindings they’ve place on local officers, the federal agents will stay.
“Hi, I don’t have enough followers on this “free speech” site, because people keep getting banned for speaking their minds. Can you guys come over and play? I’m REALLY lonely and desperate. Please?”  Poor baby Nunes. Next, you’ll start quoting Trump. “NOBODY LIKES ME!!” 😭😭  🤣
On the State house side,  failed to field candidates in 5 districts that swung to Trump, including one. he won by double digits. furthermore the GOP failed to field candidates in 5 other seats that Clinton won by a margin of 5% or less
I was just checking out our nation's top witch doctor/Trump advocate's website, but it crashed.  probably demons.
The state GOP couldn't even field a candidate in two Senate Seats Trump won by double digits, no candidate in another seat that Clinton won by just 8 votes, and another seat Clinton carried just 49%-46%.
For the ones that say Trump ain’t Racist , please review Tweet .
All Trump is doing now is greasing his palm along with all the lackeys involved with him. We need to STOP this.  It is disgraceful 😔.
Yes.. pretty much. it's kind of the same way he answered the question from the reporter... When Biden called him a racist..    .. with more racism.  Trump is a disgusting racist !
"They" went to black people.  You know that the term "segregation" means one thing in this country, and that is what you intentionally wanted to claim Trump is doing.
Ask yourself: Why is it that Trump rarely (if ever) addresses "not-so-great" actions taken by Putin? Sure, theres been sanctions put down, but they had like a 97-2 vote in the Senate. Why is Russia always given preferential treatment by this President and his administration?
The booming Trump economy they make up has been essentially shattered by the economic effects of the public health crisis. He left us completely unprepared and took months to even wear a mask.  ya’ll are really about to be rocked at the vote in November
investigated by whom?  the Trump admin?
Remember when Trump put Nazi troops on the American flag?   He is a RACIST!
Trump has always desperately cared about what people think of him, and he refused to be transparent about his taxes and financials. That sounds like a politician to me.

There were 10,000 assholes protesting in Providence last month like animals.    Don’t blame trump.   😅😂🤣🤣
I love Trump more now.
Is it me? Or has the last 8 months of this dumpster fire year gone by lightning fast but the next 96 days to vote Trump’s punk ass out of office is dragging? Like, you have to wonder if he goes away, will he take this curse away with him?? #VoteTrumpOut2020
I agree Mika ! I wish mo harm on anyone regardless of their beliefs ! Trump is the real murderer for doing absolutely nothing !  Calls himself a leader..Never ! He's the joke of the entire world! Maybe he's the Alien DNA ?

The bottom line  she was, bused as, a, kid  she  deserves it. I am so upset that Biden won't  choose her that I will stick  with trump
Trump is posting a classic pre-textual argument. He banned some travel from China because that is his default solution, his knee-jerk response to impending crisis. Find someone to blame and then hurt them.

Trump Reportedly Lied About Throwing 1st Pitch, just like everything else. As a lifelong Yankees fan, this would have been disastrous.
Personally, I'm not putting a toe in those dangerous waters until after the election. IMO, we have a gun to our heads, loaded with Trump. When there's a gun to my head, I do what I have to do. In fact, for the first time, I'm actually registered as a Dem.
Trump is BLOWING IT AGAIN! And I am so glad to see him stumble and fall overboard as he tries to rescue his sinking ship. Going back out there for his “Chinavirus Briefings” was bound to pour gas on the dumpster fire that is his campaign 2020. We will fight the virus without him!
I don’t know but if someone told me Trump was an alien hybrid experiment born from demon sperm and ghost sex- I’d probably believe it.

She’s still not getting enough recognition to waste my vote. If I can’t assume she’s gonna get over 30% of the vote (which she’s not), It’s a wasted vote to help get Trump Reelected.
Main problem with your campaign is we have to come looking for you, you aren’t broadcasted or shown anywhere. This election needs different candidates other than Biden and Trump.
By the the way, before you bash me for being a democrat, I supported trump and was completely impartial until 2020
Or how poor of a display trump has had over the past 7 months... but we’ll ignore all that for the sake of you
WTF - do we have to wait until November to get Trump out?
Yes Trump is tossing his salad. Ewwww
So you are saying that trump is still better??? He’ll I’d vote for Mickey Mouse if I could.
Hello Twitter Sports, this is a PANDEMIC currently being mismanaged by our inept President Trump.  Don't help him,  chill out, that's all.
I like Him Jordan but I can't stand the Democrats, they are too bossy. They didn't allow Barr said anything. They carried on talking their charging upon Barr and Trump. This is pathetic.
It’s about time! He’s been posting inflammatory and misleading crap for years.  Trump Jr suspended by Twitter for posting 'misleading and potentially harmful information' about coronavirus | The Independent
I fear the democrats winning in 2020, feeling even more empowered by their ever rightward pull and employing tea party and trump staff in their Harris 2024 campaign. Instead of the Bush/never trump staff that's populating the Biden campaign currently.

The  once again shows 2020 takes over the HOUSE AND SENATE! Thank you very much! And, OH,  you'll have plenty of time for golf with trump.
Let me know when you get your next Trump check, sucka!
Trump. Will. Not visit John Lewis what a AHole
Oh so he's involved with trump hating Failing Lincoln project? This fat stupid slob was McCains  failed campaign manager and tried to say he turned  democrat ! Such a failure in life 😜
Black Trump supporter STABBED in Portland, CNN withholds the facts, says COPS tear gassed 'peaceful' protesters
Advisor: 'Mr President, it's all about the algorithms.' Trump: 'We need to arrest Al Gore.'
Their favorite trick...to misinterpret what you say, on purpose...to make you sound like a monster. That's one reason they hate Trump so much. He's one of the few Reps who fight back.
Alot of crap. About why Senator Harris won't be chosen, bottomline Trump. Is a Puncher and aggressive so is Kamella, Biden needs her and so does our Country!
No he certainly does not ! John Lewis was honorable and honest in his beliefs! Trump is a pathological liar and an obvious bigot ! Real POS definitely not the POTUS !
Agreed....and you as well. 🍻
Fair enough. I withdraw calling ya a lib...but I stand by asking you to speak for yourself. 🇺🇸
Stay classy ⁦  Trump Refuses to Pay His Respects to Civil Rights Leader John Lewis at the Capitol
Hahaha. Speak for yourself lib.
Trump always GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO HURT and DO THE WRONG THING....  THINKING ITS THE RIGHT THING TO DO...  IMPEACHED and DISGRACED...
There is NOTHING TO MASS PRODUCE YET!!!!  Another LIE as Trump kills more of us everyday...  Stop this MADDNESS   RISE UP AND SAY “We are mad as hell and we aren’t taking it anymore”!!  Stop Trump in November and let’s get him out resoundingly so he can’t refute his REJECTION.
This is CRAZY!  Children seperated at the border from THEIR FAMILIES WITH NO PROCESS TO REUNITE THEM...  and Melania gets involved with issues related to children but not BROWN ONES!!  How obvious Trump infects everyone...even a descent woman in Melania... imagine Barons problems
Now we know the total idiot is tRump and Steve is fortunate to NOT work for him.
Please help this man win. Get Trump's puppets out of office.
President Trump lied about giving the US American people more Stimulus money right now.
You’re only as good as the quality of the feedback you actively seek. Unpleasant truths trump disingenuous flattery. #Business #Entrepreneur #Consulting
IF RHODE ISLAND HAD VOTER'S IS REQUIRED. RHODE ISLAND WOULD BE RED. RHODE ISLAND LOVE'S PRESIDENT TRUMP😍😍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I LOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP MORE EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY. PRESIDENT TRUMP LOVE'S USA CITIZENS FIRST LAST AND ONLY🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Paranoid much? Mr trump it’s our house not yours we just let you stay there for just 99 more days
They've invested their all into being anti-Trump to the extreme...if they let their foot off the pedal, they will lose everything they have, this is their only hope. They have to nurture the anger they've created.
President Trump &amp; Twitter: There’s No Fix for His Bad Tweets | National Review
Maybe trump does he will#trumpisnotabovethe law
Trump’s gestapo violently attacked moms and veterans who were only yelling at them.  Trump and his congressional klanboys only want a violent and racist America.
How many emails and texts to Russia, Saudi and Turkey did Jared and Ivanka delete via WhatsApp?   Asking for America.   TRUMP AND HISS BFF PUTIN HATE AMERICA.
Ouch!' 'Biden’s plan calls for expenditures equal to five times the amount that consumers and industry are now spending annually on electricity.”  The average monthly residential electric bill of $120 mo would soar to $600 or more.
Very grateful for the words of encouragment from President Trump's senior campaign advisor Corey Lewandowski. This man helped President Trump make America great again, now let's make Rhode Island great again!   #liberty #freedom
What about Trump’s Russians killing American troops?
Trump chose Confederate Swastikas over our Veterans.  #StopLying
Yeah... Sooooo enthusiastic that Trump claims the polls are wrong Because many don’t want to identify with him   UNTIL NOVEMBER ELECTIONS....  How’s that for enthusiasm
It is Only a matter of time before TRUMP GETS THE VIRUS!!!
When the Reagan Foundation is asking the GOP and Trump  to stop using Reagan in their fundraising and still the GOP swings further right (won't separate from Trump), I don't think the problem is mail ballots. Btw people have been using mail ballots for years...
Charlottesville Nazis violently killed an innocent girl.  Trump: They are very fine people.
Trump knows he’s going to lose! 🤣😂🤣
Republicans are literally blowing their noses on the American flag! 🖕🏼   TRUMP HATES AMERICA!
Electricity as in Trump getting the electric chair after his trial?
Biden holds daunting lead over Trump as US election enters final stretch.
Trump can't shift public attention from his coronavirus failures to the streets of America.
President Obama is on An Empty golf course no one around him where was the president’s mask when he had all those little league players on the White House lawn he is such a hypocrite trump worst president ever.
Are you fucking kidding me there still worried about what President Obama does . He’s not running for president the man is retired he did eight years as president And he did it honestly and admirably something Trump can never say.
Bad stuff, agreed. I wouldn't call it fascist in context of his whole career.   In 4 Trump has done far more damage. Most of his policies and stated beliefs are extremely fascist.
TRUMP WON'T BE THROWING OUT THE BALL. HIS FEET HURT:)
Didn’t you mr trump, pence, Barr, devos all vote by mail... hmmmm oh and Ivanka “ tried” to? Your tactics to fear monger people are actually doing the opposite
I think so.
I’m voting again for Trump I am the small blue state of Rhode Island
Daddy trump must be so proud of you
Great! Trump has been trying to pull the troops out of Afghanistan. Welcome aboard the MAGA train!
He spelled #trump virus wrong once again
Democrats inaction as violence scorched our cities is why President Trump will be re-elected easily.
Trump will win.  Biden will lose. #Trump2020LandslideVictory #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is what we’re dealing with. Cotton wants to be the next Trump, which is why it is essential we defeat Trump and all Republicans who support him so badly &amp; consistently that we end Trumpism itself.
If you’re pro trump you fell for the other trap lol
It’s not fair to pay for tRump’s golf excursions!!!!!!!!
His polling is discouraging, so like Trump he is dishing fake humane concern.
"...demonstrators have the moral high ground. It wrecks Trump's argument." Hahahaha bahahaha.
Can you imagine Trump taking chase?
If tRump get re- elected, I have to leave this my Country!  I can no longer look or listen to this POS!!
Time to show the video clip of TRUMP MAKING FUN OF A PARAPLEGIC WRITER for a local paper...  REMEMBER TRUMPS IMPERSONATION...  MAKING FUN OF HIM...  WE DO...AND WILL COME NOVEMBER!!!  Stop Trumps MADDNESS
Reagan is too classy for Trump?  That’s a low bar. 🤣
Trump's presence at the John Lewis funeral would have defiled the gathering.
I have had the exact same convo with a couple of friends. They don't know why but they know that Trump is a "dangerous racist". One sweet middle age lady admitted she didn't even know the difference btwn democrat and republican,just that she is voting Joe! It's crazy
You are feeding right in to Trump. He wants the violence, he wants to send his Federal Troops against you and he wants you to look like violent thugs so he can stop all that you protested for.
me and my vavo VS the stupid ass trump supporters in my family, i love this man
Such big words!  Trump becomes mysteriously eloquent when talking to Putin?
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty - The Boston Globe
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I agree - at the same time, "actual news" is so much more volatile now than in 2016. What were the big news stories in the summer of '16 that weren't directly tied to the campaign? It's hard for me to see how any of the "actual news" helps Trump, but it does add uncertainty.
The COVID-19 tragedy in this country continues to sweep through the country. Incompetent POTUS Trump lies and denies. No national strategy. When will this end? As if today 4.3 million cases and almost 150,000 deaths. Protect yourselves. Wear masks. Socially distance.
FYI:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  dONALD tRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, which runs the 40th president’s library near Los Angeles, has demanded that President Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) quit raising campaign money by using Ronald Reagan’s name and likeness.”
Trump Just doesn’t seem to fit in this picture...
Funny how MSG erupted with cheers at masvidal/Diaz  when trump showed up
"In the past four decades, China has been very aggressively pressing the limits. It is single-minded. They want to become the sole world power and change the world order to fit China's ideology,"
Another pawn. Numbers are padded. If it weren’t for Trump millions would be dead. Get a grip on reality.
Agree violence not answer. But I am skeptical of identity of those who perpetrated. Trump/Barr/Prince are always around.
He'll find a way to speak to us. No matter what he TRIED to warn us and trump shut him up long ago! Not sure how much he can add NOW anyway.
Trump sucks! Pence sucks! Governors suck! Mayors suck! But, most of all, PEOPLE SUCK! Like not knowing to get out of the rain! 4 million people....because people SUCK! May the rest of us STAY SAFE!
As late as March...libs such as DeBlasio, aoc, and Pelosi were telling people to still go places, like Chinatown. Rep. Swallwell was making fun of those advocating for wearing the mask in March. But no...it's Trump and ALL Trump, lol.
