Why is there a JOE BIDEN, NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER? Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden!!!! Now Schumer is flipping the ideology against Trump as starting it on religion.

It was in their best interest to get a deal. Now you just hand a win to Trump.
What can we do? Trump and his butt plugs are operating on the ‚Äúkitchen sink,‚Äù strategy they are willing to do anything and everything in to win by any means necessary. The repugnant party is complicit in their silence and behind the scenes actions. We cannot not survive 4more yes
IMO, Trump is horrible for Whites. MAGA doesn't consider him an ally. They are not paying attention to him. Also, it is mainstream conservatism that has marginalized him. Empowering conservatives just means more tax cuts and wars

Without a new law passed before Nov, PA doesn't allow (likely Dem-leaning) absentee ballot to be tallied until polls fully close on EDay.    Which makes this tweet by trump ominous to say the least:
Lol bro being anti Biden isn't being pro Trump.  This was fun though, take care
trump's strategy in PA: -Polarize absentee voting so GOP voters go in-person. -Litigate the end of ballot drop boxes so Dem voters who vote absentee are forced to use USPS.  -Corrupt USPS so ballots don't arrive by EDay.
Republicans were never going to agree to the Democrats stimulus plan or even negotiate with them. They were always going to shoot it down so Trump can do what he wants through executive order and call himself the hero.
Democrats want to give Americans $600 a week to help them through the pandemic.   Trump and his Republicans do not.   That‚Äôs all this is. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.
Just be honest Joey, and say ‚Äúbecause I hate Trump‚Äù, because we all know you do.
If people had listened to Trump in March, instead of shutdown the information that HCQ was a game changer. Many people who are now lost forever, would be walking around living life. Willful ignorance = negligent homicide.
Trump wants the glory of issuing Executive Orders (which may/not provide any real relief) for re-election purposes.

This is my view of Democrats. They were always nutty, but Trump pushed them off their ledge. Now they are total loons.
Dr. Fauci fooled a lot of ppl. They planned the üí© out well. Dr. Fauci SEEMED to have been against tRump in the beginning, but it was an optic illusion. He was to gain the trust of the ppl. That lady in that video warned us about him. DR. FAUCI IS NOW SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOING
Exactly. And the Trump dictatorship is so extreme that criminals like Comey, Clinton and Brennan have not been arrested and charged. And a Democrat judge will not dismiss charges against general Flynn after the prosecutors admitted that the FBI framed him.
I will vote for Donald Trump without reservation. He has been a breath of fresh air in corrupt Washington. If the Democrats are so wonderful how have Pelosi, Schumer and Biden have been there 40-50 years and the problems are all Trump‚Äôs fault..

If Trump comes up with a lot of asinine rules, he probably will be ignored by the outlet. Plus Biden won't bother debating with him. Which will hurt Trump more, given today's polling.
I understand but the stuff they say incites far right groups to action. Remember how Trump rallied his followers to act on the governor in Michigan? That was dangerous, what the man motivated to send pipe bomb to his enemies? Free speech has limits

The fact that he could say that is proof he needs to be off the air. Trump has been married 3 times had an affair on all 3 wives including his present one. Told 20,000 lies, paid off a porn star and mistress asked a country to investigate his rival but Obama is sleazy.
How did you draw that conclusion? No, that‚Äôs not what I am saying, HOWEVER, they need to FEEL like they lost our demographic, because w/ SOME, it‚Äôs the ONLY way they appreciate what they have. My conscience wouldn‚Äôt allow me 2 do NOTHING, re getting Trump out
Exactly, Democrats need to stop encouraging this step-aside garbage and maybe think things through for once. Pence would be a formidable candidate and I think has been the de facto president for much of the Trump administration.

If you have to ask is Trump a fascist after seeing a tweet like today's, calling to delay the election....I don‚Äôt understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can‚Äôt believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.

And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don‚Äôt vote for him even if you can‚Äôt stand his opponent.

Trump has defended his appt of several billionaires to his cabinet by saying, ‚ÄúIn those particular positions, I just didn‚Äôt want a poor person.‚Äù James 2:4 ‚Äúthat when we show partiality to the wealthy, we become ‚Äújudges with evil thoughts‚Äù #Biblicalidiot

Republicans are already talking about attacking Kamala Harris if she is picked. I suspect Trump will pull off his schoolyard bully-pulpit to attack her personally.   Susan Rice is who they really want to ambush. They have nothing to run on about Kamala.   Bring it bitch.

Coming from someone who fell hook, line, and sinker for the #RussiaHoax, thought the #MuellerReport was going to be the end of Trump, was convinced the #Impeachment was based on fact, and still owes me $40 for being wrong on all of it. So who‚Äôs the dummy?
I never said anyone was bad people. Your comments implied that just bc someone may vote for Trump that they will fall in line &amp; vote for Tubs &amp; I disagree. What does he stand for other than to put his stamp on anything Trump says? What has he done for the people of AL?
That‚Äôs me giving people the benefit of the doubt that they‚Äôll vote for someone who has actually done things for the state of AL &amp; is talking about real issues/solutions...&amp; not someone who doesn‚Äôt really live in AL &amp; has no original thought or real position other than ‚ÄútRuMp‚Äù.

The media is adamantly trying to argue that Trump may question the election results and not leave office. What they should be covering is the reaction of BLM and Antifa rioters when he wins. I honestly wonder how our cities will deal with that. But alas, journalists are silent.

You have officially lost it.  Trump lives rent-free in your head.  You are a great singer but you are way over the top with your hate.
Finding it hard to believe that Trump's MAGA supporters are not being negatively affected by the GOP stonewalling on COVID-19 aid package. More public awareness is needed to show that ALL of the problems we face came about on the GOP's WATCH!
Thinking that the source of this treatment is Trump's MAGA supporters who take his criticism of any public official as a 'go' ticket to do harm or even more pain! Cohen described it as Trump code, and there are many, many MAGAs out there to do Trump's bidding! For free!

So, Russia doesn't want Biden to win and China doesn't want Trump to win, according to ODNI.  Actually, that definitely makes sense. Biden would be more polite to China which they want for business/superpowering  and Russia wants Trump for business/foreign indifference. 1/2

I don't care if Trump went to Wharton or any other institute of learning. The dude's understanding and use of the English language is on a 3rd grade level at absolute *best*.  And no, him being a well traveled con man doesn't make him smart at all. It makes him cold, and lucky.
Must be a Bernie Bro who doesn't realize that Biden has already apologized and clarified his statement from yesterday! One hell of a lot more than your favorite, Trump, is even capable of doing! "Killing God?" "Killing the Bible?" Don't hear an apology from DJT for saying that!
Obama was cool and all but I wouldn't say I'm on """Team Obama""".  I'm more on Team Get Trump Out of Office as soon as Humanly Possible omg Why won't he just resign 85ish days is too damn long oh wait he's president until January 20th God help us all.  Too long a name?
If Biden, a proven multi-liar, chooses Rice, another multi-liar, the Trump campaign will be in nirvana..... I say this as a NeverTrumper.
Man, the Bernie Bros and Russian bots are out in force today! They must be bored as Trump hasn't done anything stupid enough today to blame on Biden! (But it's only 1:30 PM CDT!)

Trump's payroll tax proposal is a bad idea and probably illegal
Is this a new campaign hat authorized by Trump himself? Based on what he and the GOP have done to our country over the past eight months, it's a perfect fit! When does it go on sale? His MAGAs and evangelical supporters will buy them up fastly!
And Trump thought Thailand was pronounced Thighland! Your point?
Careful "taking the bait" responding to Trump criticism. Your clarification was good and needed but you can't respond everytime Trump raises his ugly head out of Putin's ass or Fox News.
It would certainly seem like that! He's tried to start other culture wars, so what would be different than a religious war? After all, he has the evangelicals led by F. Graham and Jerry Falwell, Jr. as his top generals, the latter who can't keep his pants zipped just like Trump!
Not sure what your point of view is, but the COVID-19 has been here since January and the GOP knew it was here but did nothing. Sens. Burr &amp; Loeffler sold of stocks at a profit in February! They knew, but did nothing! Do you want 4 more years of misery under Trump? Seems so!

Isn't this, by definition an oxymoron? (Referring to Trump of course, NOT biden!)
If Biden had that kind of power, Trump would be in a straight jacket encased in a padded cell that uses barb wire as its wall! His 'meals' would be MacD' and KFC washed down with hydoxyclean in liquid form! But, alas, Biden wouldn't use his power in this manner! He's a nice guy!
That state will be very close no question. Obviously, I think it will be much smaller than his 9 point win (smaller than McCain and Romney who won by double digits in 2008 and 2012). Between OH, IA, TX, GA and NC, I think Trump‚Äôs weakest one is NC which could really flip.
Good point about convention bounces. If anything is to be determined from this, there will be some tightening but in the end, Trump will lose (EVEN in the press-revered Electoral College).

That's inane. What's to say Trump would get the votes of those who instead decide to vote third party or write-in? I actually have a poll showing most people who would vote for a third choice will instead vote Biden if they see no third choice.

So you're voting for trump.
This is really idiocracy. He really is the candidate. It's not a dream. The rumors of a long range plan to make a black woman the next president seem too true. People will truly be voting Trump vs Biden's running mate.
Interesting that Justice Roberts has offended both Obama and Trump with his rulings.
And let us make no mistake: This happens on the GOP's watch, under Trump, and the economy will only crater faster and deeper bc of their ignorance and self-serving political and economic incompetence! And we KNOW the dems are working FOR us and the GOP isn't!

And even if someone gives them money and doesn't care that they're just lining the pockets of Wayne LePierre and Trump, that's still fraudulent and must be stopped.
Mr. Obama: Yesterday on CNN, Mark Meadows proclaimed that our voting is a "privilege" and NOT a right! Meadows is Trump's Chief of Staff so it must be assumed that Trump's views on voting are the same as Meadows. How is this not an attack on our rights under the Constitution?
FYI: Mark Meadows said yesterday, on CNN, that our voting is a 'privilege' and NOT a right! John Lewis is barely in his grave and Meadows, along with Trump and the GOP, is trashing everything that he stood for and risked his life!
I do see the guy that says, "Man...I just may stay home cause Trump kinda let me down and fuck Biden..." -- to now being all "Well now I gotta vote cause they trying to take muh guns!" - That's my more concern. Why give them something they're that passionate about at this point?
Disgusting choice. Wondering with all of the xenophobic comments over the years if he has ever mentioned and antisemitic beliefs? Meaning that his leader has, so why not him? GOP would consider that a plus for his approval. And Trump does not like Merkle!
Actually he hasn't worked with the World Health Organization since the beginning of the pandemic here. Trump has effectively pushed back on data coming from them and has said he wants to take away the funds the US contributes.
Lately, pictures of McConnell have shown him as a broken man and the head of a broken GOP.  has titled one of his books: "Everything That Trump Touches...Dies" and these pics demonstrate the truth of Wilson's words!
Shame that Trump couldn't, or wouldn't, come up with a similar plan for Puerto Rico, an American territory with American citizens! But the majority of its citizens are brown skinned, so they are s**t-out-of-luck as far as the GOP and Trump are concerned! NO equality for them!
Trump wants to defund social security. No
Lie in order to get elected. But no, Trump does not show that he cares for the children by only saying send them back into a classroom knowing full well we haven't done anything to try to mitigate kids getting sick. Cases are already being reported in states that reopened class.
Kayne West is looking to replace Pence on Trump's ticket! Not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing! But will Kayne's wife Kim stoop so low as to take up residence in The Blair House? Would Kayne release their taxes? So many questions with no answers!
How does one become a 'pragmatic problem solver' when the same person is the problem? McSally is one of Trump's GOP and that is one of the largest problems that the true republicans, and the rest of us, face on November 3, 2020.
We will not be fooled by this trump operative
This should be a non story. He doesn't have time to get ballot access and unless his poll numbers are through the roof he will never get near a debate stage. This isn't about Biden or Trump, its a means to silence 3rd party candidates.

Free speech has limits. You can't scream "Fire" in a movie theater, for instance if there isn't one. The inaccurate information that Trump is giving to folks, is essentially doing the same thing. By telling people kids are basically immune to this virus, puts us all at risk.
At the mall once i heard a mother tell her son, "Things cost money. You can thank Donald Trump for that."

I find it hard to believe this is not going to be another gotcha moment for Trump.  He sets this stuff up to appear weak and then it all blows up in their faces.  Who knows?  His base is not having any of it and they‚Äôre ready to fight.
He has a pretty clear cut platform. Having said that, even if he didn‚Äôt have one it would still be better than the Democrats platform of ‚ÄúAnyone but Trump.‚Äù They‚Äôd nominate the Devil with a pedophile as his running mate so long as it‚Äôs not Trump. That‚Äôs beyond sad and immature

My guess is that it‚Äôs not alleging anything. Rather, whenever Trump &amp; Company is accused of anything bad, the first response is always ‚Äúbut _____ did it too/worse‚Äù, so this is probably just Team MAGA warning everyone about what they plan on doing after Trump loses.
Our entire existence as we know it is based on a fictional narrative set up by the FBI Mockingbird campaign all so trump could come 25 years later to save us from fake news?

So,  doesn't like vote-by-mail... EXCEPT in Florida, where is says it's necessary. Hypocrite much?         -
The projects are in democratic states and were trashed when Trump was elected!
We have seen this picture before and the MSM are into re-runs of 2016 this summer! Every network, including FOX is flooding us with polls that have absolutely no bearing on the 2020 election! NONE of them! Yet here we are again with a real potential of Trump winning again! SAD!

Trump fires TVA board chair after outsourcing uproar
Prefer to let them see my face!! I‚Äôm proud to VOTE TRUMP 2020 and VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER
If the GOP had any humanity they would remove Trump. He‚Äôs just an effect of a rotted party.
SRuhle sees the big "picture" in a rapidly "developing" Kodak situation...while Trump admin. would have us "gloss" over the details, it'll be over in a "flash" and the $ will no longer be the "focus"...we'll be left in the "dark"room with our "rolls" of hoarded toilet paper.
Imagine devoting your whole life to Donald Trump
Lmaooo üòÇüòÇ have you seen the papers where it says he has dementia?ü•¥ I would‚Äôve much preferred Bernie over any of them but he dropped out so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but i would literally rather have any other candidate except trump/kayne bunch of idiots fr
He‚Äôs far from the best candidate we‚Äôve got I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Biden either but I would rather him over trump and or kayne ANY day of the year
beginning to look like Falwell is trying to emulate Donald Trump with his awkward social life. More and more pictures / videos are coming out, each one a little more risque. This while preaching and teaching evangelicals about the greatness of God! Oxymoron?
Best news interviews are not neat and full of soft ball questions.  did the best for his brand. But what did we learn? Little. Swan handed Trump an opportunity to praise Lewis and show his credentials on race. He turned it down and sounded obscenely ignorant.
President Trump‚Äôs latest complaint about states shifting toward voting by mail due to the spread of the coronavirus came days after he floated the possibility of delaying November‚Äôs election entirely.
is overdosing on her hydroxyclean again! He boss is trying to kill off the USPS, but a majority of the GOP needs the post office to exist if they stand any chance of election, or re-election, this November. And yet here we are! GOP vs Trump's GOP.
I.....hate Ygg but I can see where he was coming from.  Trump is massively ignorant and uneducated, and at this point dementia-laden, but like Reagan he was very smart when it came to manipulating humans.   Shows the limits and failures of using smart vs. dumb as our only measure
Reminder: Trump doesn't joke!
Trump turns on anyone who do not support him. Why should Mrs. Birx be surpised?
Gay Trump supporter arrested defacing Black Lives Matter mural for second time   THIS BOY ISN'T GAY HE IS SICK FOR SUPPORTING A PARTY AND A POTUS WHO WORKS EVERY DAY TO DENY HIM CIVIL RIGHTS AND JUSTICE.
If trump successes it down playing in the public mine and heart.   especially the Congress and people of color.    Then BLM and the rest has been a waste of time for over 70 years to date.
Trump Got Cooked in That Axios Interview
The quality of the  interview with Trump is objectively better than the  interview.
I still follow you even though I disagree with you at times for tweets like this. I have no problem calling out Democrats when they suck, and feel no alliance to the Democratic party. Also, it doesn‚Äôt take a raging liberal to come to the conclusion Trump should not be prez.
But FOX thought it was a great interview, though they won't run any of it without doing a lot of editing...a LOT of editing! Trump's propaganda network will soon be running out of good things to say about THEIR LEADER and then the real garbage talk will begin!
They've made me stronger in my commitment to President Trump. Love is definitely blind. Otherwise Kellyanne would have pinched that turd off long ago.
Thinking that the Trump campaign is trying to derail his re-election bid. The major retailers, Walmart, Target, CVS, and even our own military will revolt at this not-so-secret attempt start a cold war with China at their (and our) expense! Utter stupidity!
VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER. VOTE TRUMP 2020!!
I think my first sentence should have said ‚ÄúYou are making the same mistake Trump critics make‚Äù. Ha.
The last time Trump wished someone well he turned up dead in his 'protected' jail cell! And now we have to depend on AG Barr to 'protect' Maxwell? What could possibly go wrong?
And suddenly Trump demands our vaccine is brought forward. What a mess
You are doing the same mistake Trump critics do. Creating a bar so low, that it doesn‚Äôt take much to look like something is a win for the opponent. Happens with Trump all the time. People act like he should be praised for his brief moments of being a normal functioning adult.
VOTE RED IN EVERY ELECTION THROUGH NOVEMBER. VOTE TRUMP 2020
I've been saying Trump should withdraw from the re-election campaign. Scratch that. He should resign from the presidency now.
What a pathetic, ignorant, racist, SOB Trump is. Seriously.
America was much greater before Trump.
Thinking that if anything happens to Ghislaine Maxwell while in jail awaiting trial the blame should be placed squarely on AG William Barr. Another death like Jeffrey Epstein's would be unconscionable, yet this is where we are. Trump wishing her well is code for kill her!
Trump is such a coward he can't face the truth and has to use contrived graphs and "facts". He will never accept that he totally dropped the ball and lost the fight. He's responsible for so much death and suffering while he thanked the Chinese for their transparency.
TRUTH IS THE ENEMY OF TRUMP!
TRUTH IS THE ENEMY OF TRUMP!
Nice to see Sen. Grassley pontificating the Beatles' "Love is all you need" song from the 70's. Too bad he's forgotten the rest of the lyrics. Grassley and the GOP have allowed Trump to get away with every crime against humanity that he's done and he wants us to love him?
Who is more stupid than Trump? A trump follower.
Waiting on Kelleyanne or her surrogate Kayleigh to come out and announce that Trump just had the greatest interview with Axios. He was clear and concise in his message to the American people, then they walk back inside and gag on their words!
Trump is an idiot. The President should have taken firm control in February; unfortunately we don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù President, only a ‚Äúreality TV‚Äù one.
Trump must think that he's Abe's doppelganger without John Wilkes Booth waiting in the wings wearing a MAGA hat and a swastika arm band.
If you think these things only became bad or corrupt because of Trump, then you‚Äôre just stupid
Isn't "Thou shall not kill" one of the 10 Commandments? Guessing not in the evangelical bible. So what do we call this 'have to due" statement from Trump? It's a little more serious than "Let them eat cake" from Marie Antoinette. What are Melania's thoughts? Or Ivanka's?If they like Trump or McMahon, no.
Trump wants his base to think he will do what Congress and Senate ought to.  And they will believe it. Once they hear his lie, they will stick with the desired belief, no matter what, &amp; Trump knows this.
Please please please QUIT being "in disbelief" about anything trump does. The man is pure evil. Hell he might kill 10 million people with nukes before he leaves office, and you are STILL capable of being "in disbelief" that he would stage a show at his club during a pandemic??
üëÄ üò≤shocking that there might be corruption üôÑ I‚Äôm calling it now that some trump affiliate buys tik tok too to access any potential ‚Äúinformation‚Äù gathered. They don‚Äôt get to be/stay successful by being honest businessmen ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That‚Äôs Trump for the next 200 years üòÇ
There's needs to be a law that overrides Executive Orders that a crooked president takes away things that upsets him personally. Trump is the example of abusing Executive Orders when certain things get under his skin,More like retaliation. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Huge news!!!  Trump announces executive order repealing prohibition!  Take that Rex Banner!
after Trump will never vote Republican again no matter who or what.
We must get trump OUT. The only way to do that is vote for BIDEN. Period. One of those 2 will be president.
For BIDEN. Unless you want another 4 years of trump.

Now playing  - POG Interview.mp3 Listen here:  #trump
Trump...Russia...GOP,Yep! They know they trying to make sure Trump gets reelected and trying to slow down the USPS to sabotage Mail-In voting and Moscow Mitch won't sign the bill to stop interference...Yeah,Everyone already connecting the dots together if not already.
Who does he he is? The rules of wearing a mask is  to keep us All safe.  Oh, I forgot,  Trump and Cruz,  along with their supporters don't care if we all get coronavirus and die.  As long as they aren't inconvenienced!
Trump and the Republicans prove once again that they don't care about American people.  They only care about the rich,  who actually received the tax breaks. Vote Democrat.
Seriously, where have you been the past 4 years? üòÇ These cult members of trump‚Äôs are like every crazy evangelical who gives ppl like Paula White their life‚Äôs savings. They‚Äôre happy for NRA and trump family to live in great wealth.
And y‚Äôall smear Trump 24:7... your Russia just on the other side of the table.
I‚Äôm still a believer that the Trump presidency is just a Nathan For You bit that‚Äôs gone too far
Upset with the president? It appears  is too. Here‚Äôs some raw footage of him speaking to donors about how ‚Äúpissed off at Donald Trump‚Äù he is because veterans aren‚Äôt receiving health care.
Carefully worded , he ‚Äúwent‚Äù to Wharton . Trump is dumb as a road lizard , as my dad would say ! üòÇüòÇ
No matter how hard life gets I‚Äôd never vote for trump or Kanye üóë ü§°

Trump praising success backwards, What's horrible for America is a success for him. It's official,He's sick in the head...and I'm not surprised at that and mainly the majority of this country. Getting rid of him will be the only way to save America from him &amp; his bullshit!
It must be nice to live in this fantasy world where people pretend ‚Äúabstaining‚Äù from the Presidential vote counts for anything other than a vote for Trump
Trump‚Äôs America: First to worst. ‚ÄòIt is what it is‚Äô
Please clarify.  Did the White House play  Live and Let Die, or is the  Trump Campaign playing it?
I am really confused. I‚Äôve no doubt Trump is racist. But  Trump‚Äôs crew is looking more like a minstrel show. I‚Äôd expect to see Lincoln Perry next.
(But most of the Catholics I know, the very conservative ones, aren‚Äôt in the Trump camp. They‚Äôre just off doing their own thing in the corner somewhere)
A woman is about as valuable to trump as a piece of gum stuck on the bottom of his shoe but many whyte women will line up to vote by the thousands .
I agree. But this is how Joe really thinks. He's not the savvy Obama makeover. He inserts his foot over and over because he doesn't measure his words like a really good politician does. Trump, he doesn't pretend to be a politician. He just wants to help America to be great!
what‚Äôs funnier: Donald Trump not knowing there/their/they‚Äôre or thinking he‚Äôs going to win the ‚ÄúBlack Vote‚Äù
We're still going to vote for Joe Biden! Trump had his chance, his goose is cooked! Trump knows if he doesn't win he's going to jail! Trump is nothing but a crook and we know it ! F-Trump!
One things for sure:  security concerns or not, a pandering career politician would never take such a risk. Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump
Heck no! A pandering career politician would never take such a risk.  Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump

Trump is bad at his job
Trump is the lowest human being using God and the Holy Bible to gain advantage over a political opponent. Peace through understanding üî•
That dont mean he doesnt support trump.
Trump losing more than his approval rating,He's losing his goddamn mind! "Hurt God"...Seriously?! Trump is literally making his own case that he's is a insane madman. 4 more years of this bullshit and God himself might just smite Trump. #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
It is trump's party. Period. It is a party of disgusting racists. Period
Let‚Äôs see: a disgraced former football coach living high on the hog with taxpayer dollars; no experience or skill (such as it was) outside of football; no policy ideas; a Trump bootlicker. Sounds like the perfect Alabama Republican Senate candidate.
I thought Trump was just BSing but then I saw this photo of a young Biden.
No way he last that long, hell he can't come up with one sentence on his own that you can understand. He will not debate Trump. They picked the wrong man to lead their party.
He look like a trump supporter
Trump has been in little girls bathroom and bragged about seeing them naked .
What is/will be Facebook's role in misinformation attempts during the current election cycle?
If Joe Biden could decisively destroy the god worshiped by Trump‚Äôs supporters, he would be doing an inestimable service to America and the world.
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad is problematic as hell and a Trump supporter. So....

I wouldn't vote for someone who's crazy like Kanye west! He needs to be in the crazy house talking about when he put on a maga hat he feels like super man what a idiot he is, but if he wants to waste his money let him , hell trump is just using his crazy ass!
The republicans kept on backing trump and now you guys want to to blame the democrats for all you guys bullshit and that's not right! Trump and you guys are going to pay at the polls so get ready! Trump and you guys killed a lot of Americans with all your lies!
I bet the NRA corruption is gonna be connected to Trump and the GOP that serves him. The puzzles are being pieced together,Something tells me Trump's fear of not getting re-elected &amp; losing will be the least of his worries and Deutsche Bank is another puzzle piece too.
Will the left-leaning national media jump all over Biden for this? I know if it were Trump they would....
What a godsend for the Trump campaign.üòãüî•üî•#KAG2020 #KAG2020LandslideVictory
This grandstanding politician is going to hurt the Biden cause.  Talk about something sure to fire up the Trump base, sheesh!üî•üî•

Definitely wouldn‚Äôt be my #1 choice. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs the only choice with the backing to get rid of Trump. üò©
At this point, I wanna fight everyone that voted for Trump.... cause we‚Äôre doomed
Trump,‚ÄùMy view is the schools should open.This thing is going away. It will go away like all things go away,&amp;my view is that schools should open.{THE FOLLOWING IS A LIE}Children are almost-I would almost say definitely-but almost immune from the disease.‚Äù Think you missed a quote
Question: does anybody in my Twittersphere still have family/loved ones who are supporting Trump right now? How are you holding them accountable for the state of our country right now? (Humor is welcome, but also I‚Äôm serious.)
So don't vote for pedo trump
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are both corrupt politicians. George Washington would have disapproved of them both.
I think the same thing when liberals cry about Trump.
Those consequences might finally be coming down on Trump. #ConsequencesForTrump

FAIR: Trump‚Äôs Tantrum Against TikTok Is No Laughing Matter -
Seems like a lot to point out a photoshopped picture. What‚Äôs the point if it happens all the the time? I don‚Äôt see that much concern when people get butthurt over photoshopped Trump pictures.
Trump treating his press conference like at TV show,Because that what is is. He's lies,Spread misinformation,and any other bullshit he can come up with because he's desperate for attention. Not surprising everyone already knows this! You know you can change the channel.
I talk a lot about being a virgin but honestly, I almost lost it in undergrad but changed my mind at the last minute. But lmao, call it blessed intuition because he turned into a trump supporter a few years later.   Also, i vet white men now.
Someone needs to tell him Alabama isn‚Äôt the opponent anymore. Wait until Trump finds out. He‚Äôs gonna be in sooooo much trouble.
Not to mention: there‚Äôs a snowball‚Äôs chance in hell Donald Trump can drive a stick.

It's time Trump has a nice long retirement.  Voting Biden.
Trump has Always been Jealous of Obama.  He continues to prove almost 4 years after the last election.
Trump is such a Liar and Fraud.  Americans are supposed to be so Dumb that we shouldn't figure out that the Only reason he approved mail in voting in Florida is because he fears losing due to Democrats huge numbers of requests to vote by mail.
Trump is his daddy
Putin has Trump on strings,Trump has GOP Senators &amp; GOP Congress on strings. At this point,They are too far gone and when you are too far gone you'll end up like those people in The Walking Dead.
As long as it help our 401-k good. They quit listening to Trump
Trump hates people that tells the truth or fact-checks him. He only wants me his words to matter,Not the reality of what's happening. He's proving his own case why he's unfit to be president the GOP &amp; MAGA knows this too but won't admit it. Everyone else is smart enough to notice
We need a counter for every time Trump says the words "fake news" because it seems that he has something to hide but it's not surprising because that "Hitler Playbook" exposing him w/o question. Everyone already knows those tricks is wearing themselves out.

Trump was NOT correct. We have 480 deaths per 1 mil population. The entire world has 87 deaths per 1 mil population. We are 7th worst out of 200 countries in deaths per capita. 193 countries better than us, only 7 worse.
We need a coherent Federal plan for getting through this. Three weeks ago Trump said he'd show us his health care plan "in two weeks."  Re: Cuomo, also abhorrent &amp; I won't defend it because, unlike some, I don't worship power &amp; excuse failure by pointing fingers elsewhere.
trump works?? üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ Works on his golf score, and he can't even accomplish that because he has the worst swing I've ever seen. I HATE golf, never play, and even I can hit straighter than he can. Jesus H. tap-dancing Christ at the prom, you bots think we üá∫üá∏ are stupid, huh?
Watch "Trump Humiliated In Worst Interview in History" on YouTube
Your insinuation was that most white rep. will vote Tuberville because he is a Trump puppet. That‚Äôs untrue. Most Alabamians vote for those that reflect their morals and values.  Sometimes it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils.  Insulting us because we believe different is immature.
Everyone in this country should know that your not only voting to get Trump out of office or vote his GOP &amp; MAGA enablers out,You're voting to save our country from them and their bullshit because we're not gonna put up for it for another 4 years,Hell No to that...VOTE IN NOV.!
Trump is trying to sabotage,cheat,&amp; steal the election! That is the best and easier way to say it because it's the truth. No Narratives,No Media Spins,No Conspiracy Theories,It's A Cold Hard Reality Fact! Everyone that wants him gone better vote like their life depends on it!
There‚Äôs absolutely no proof of that... testing is actually getting faster each and every week in most states.. slow testing falls on your state governments not Trump.
Nah. Only thing that would‚Äôve probably prevented that is an entire national lockdown.. and you would‚Äôve had an issue with that too. Trump is doing all he can from a government stand point.

This criticism assumes there‚Äôs no difference in confessing to a stranger on the phone that you‚Äôre a Trump supporter as Biden.   There‚Äôs a huge difference and it explains why polling might be off in one direction only. It‚Äôs the Doug Wilder effect.
Was sent this information feom the Trump administration. Recieved much more information aswell! See you in court!
Great work done by the Trump Administration!
Trump doesn't care about the thousands dying of Covid 19. He sure won't care if he is successful in stirring up some kind of trouble to get people killed on the streets to try to disrupt the election.
Imagine how Yosemite Sam would feel when he realizes that Trump mis-pronounced his name Yo-Semite.
Yes it was verified, thats not even debateable. Now ask yourself if you are okay with how trump has dismissed this fact repetively after admitting HIMSELF its true.
Lol. Lose to whom??  Put Biden under the same questioning and Trump will look fabulous. And it‚Äôs a 2 man race you know.
Absentee Voting is the exact same thing as Mail-in voting. Mail-in voting is secure in all 50 states, not just Florida, there has never been a case of massive voter fraud in America. Trump is just saying this about Florida because he wants to justify why he votes by Mail there.
I don‚Äôt see many Trump signs because people are afraid of being targeted... their cars and/or homes being vandalized.
that Trump interview üòÇüòÇüòÇ he really don‚Äôt give a fuck
Trump: We can't go by the cases because the cases are up due to increased testing.  Trump: our deaths are lower than the world. You have to go by the cases.  Sir, you can't have it both ways.
Trump sounds like a lot of you Twitter Doctors who think this is the common cold.
The John Lewis question was a softball any interviewer would‚Äôve thrown out ‚Äî easy to answer, easy to get right, literally requires just a few words. Trump didn‚Äôt have it in him.
Exactly. Trump has been remarkably blessed by his crazy unhinged enemies.
How long before they are tho?  It‚Äôs the non-Trump pols that seem the most eager to shut down anything resembling fun or normal life. UTAustin purported to ban parties yesterday!  Trump derangement seems to have turned libs into buzzkill Maude Flanders types. Amazing.
Trump had the goddamn nerve to say he done more for Black Americans than John Lewis. Keep his name out of your mouth you dumb orange bastard. Please everyone,Vote so we can get rid of that narcissist asshole. America can't not stand another 4 years of him! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
The thing that's obvious when you watch this is that   "he was in Congress"  "he's Black"  "he didn't come to my inauguration", and   "he's dead now"   is the *absolute sum total* of what Donald Trump knows about John Lewis.  Beyond that he has NO CLUE who they're talking about.
President Trump Just Called Out Two of the Media‚Äôs Most Dangerous Lies About COVID-19.
#YesWeCanAgain we will overcome after  is long gone. tRump prison bound!! Oh what a day that will be. I want normalcy back
But yet tRump demands our children go back to public school, he could careless about our children or any child....remember he has locked children I'm caged away from their parents and molested many young girls!!
It‚Äôs increasingly clear Trump is completely surrounded by True Believers in the White House, which is basically the most dangerous possible situation for both him and the country.
When did Biden say he was scared to debate Trump?
Trump is like
Trump just shows how dumb most Americans are. I'm glad I learned this lesson in my lifetime.
OMG! How dumb is this MF so-called president is! Trump is incapable of accepting the truth or a loss. Please vote his ass out in November I can't express that enough!
Trump is like Faust, except he traded America's soul to the Devil instead of his own.
Why does your tweet leave out that trump said "he didn't come to my inauguration"
i‚Äôm just saying if trump pushes the election i‚Äôm fighting in the civil war
Could there be a viable class action law suite by US citizens against Trump for his absolute failure to meet even the barest level of of competency for his job, etc., etc., as our president?
Trump is more of a cult leader than a president(if he ever was) and Trump's GOP Loyalists &amp; MAGAs people are his cult followers. With a dangerous cult like that,There's that one road for them and it's covered w/red all over it and I'm not taking about GOP or MAGA colors!
Maybe those MAGA &amp; GOP Idiots should ask Trump is he's too afraid to release his tax returns instead of creating conspiracy theories or any other bullshit. But then again I forgot that they rather turn a blind eye than face the truth because they are for Trump and not America!
Trump = FAKE NEWS.  Anyone who fails to tow THE PARTY LINE   COVID 19 is his enemy EVEN Leaders of the COVID 19 TASK FORCE SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER.   Watch "Burnett: Trump calls Dr. Birx pathetic after she tells the truth" on YouTube
So I hear. I think they‚Äôre just Trump haters.

Do you hear yourself when you talk,I'm sorry you must be overdosed of the Trump Kool-Aid is affecting your common sense of reality.
Trump is counting on somebody stealing/cheating for him to win the election,That's the reality. His desperation and fear of mail-in voting shows that he knows it's a losing battle that could go either way for him. I'm voting to save America from him,You should to Americans!
The polls don't decide whether Trump approval ratings is up or down,That's for the America people to decide and given that majority of us already knows that he's a desperate loser that likes to keep himself in a bubble to keep out hearing the truth.
Trump will never admit that he's paying or bribing people to fake his approval numbers. Rasmussen for example,It purpose is to only get his MAGA &amp; right-wing stooges to get excited. Mostly everyone already seen this smoke &amp; mirrors trick so many times it we can read it w/E's!
üíµ üç© Isn‚Äôt this like the kiss of death? Oh my. Trump and Brooks. Plus all the financial scandals. And the loyalty issues. At least he‚Äôs republican in Alabama.
Can someone please educate me on why trump wants tik tok taken down? It seems so stupid with everything going on
Does Trump ever look in a mirror and ever think that he's the real "Enemy Of The People"? But I keep forgetting that he's to ignorant to admit that. He's really wearing out Hitler's playbook and the "enemy" does take orders from their puppet master, Putin. #TrumpIsLosing
Is that Trump flag waiting on a SpaceX splash down? #Nauticalscience not Pseudoscience
I certainly am. I hope God intervenes and Trump wins by a landslide
So afraid for our country! Trump is dangerous beyond anything I could have imagined as a president! Ala. has the highest positive Covid 19/Trump-virus rate in the country and Trump is still pushing lies &amp; confusion!
Will you name/list the job opportunities?  Where are all those fossil fuel job opportunities that trump promised?  Where is the new healthcare reform?
Why does trump hire so many pathetic losers in the first place. Does he EVER hire anyone who is any good at anything? So many times he told us he had "the best people". And there would be so much winning. But there's just LOSING and DEATH. worst president in history

that train works great if you can follow people but Twitter locked me down 6/2017 and won‚Äôt let me follow anyone because I love Trump and hate these commie idiots and Chinese crappers
You weren‚Äôt saying this stuff on 3/25/20.... you actually agreed with Trump and the Republicans saying that ‚ÄúTik Tok is a national security threat that should only be used to call out the Chinese government....‚Äù so,  what changed??? ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°

I hope that the strongly suspected financial ties Trump likely has to the manufacture and sale of  hydroxychloroquine, are found out, that Trump is prosecuted for that corruption, and for the rest of his corruption.
Have theyw told trump that? Is he going to obey?  LOL what a ridiculously naive tweet. Dems need to vote IN PERSON EARLY
that won't work. Because trump won't play along. He will tell people he has won every state where he leads on election night and they will believe it and claim fraud when it changes. Mail in is a massively stupid idea. Vote early IN PERSON - with distancing and a mask
NOTHING the media says will change the fact that trump will claim victory in any state he leads on election night. Dems emphasizing mail in ballots instead of early IN PERSON voting (social distanced with a mask) is one of the stupidest moves EVER
Sorry dude,Your speaking Trump language. Not everyone else that is not blind.
While Trump's goons &amp; those GOP idiots trying to say violence has escalated in Portland since secret police left, Funny they must be crazy in the head,I see they been doing peaceful protest to mostly everyone else but that what people under Trump would say to push his agenda!

The only plan Trump's dumb ass has is golfing while the entire country is still in pandemic mode and silencing the 1st amendment because he can't handle the truth and he knows it! #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpHasNoPlan

Now more than ever, we need President Trump re-elected do he can continue to uncover all of you and  criminal activities
Lol. Sleepy Joe would have slept through it. The same guy that called Trump a racist for closing down travel from China esrly on? Keep drinking the kool aide.
How was your Trump dream last night? Is he paying rent for your brain? Lol.
...but voting third party in this election is essentially a vote for the current administration. We know 3rd party isn‚Äôt going to win, so in swing states in particular, it essentially ensures another 4 years of Trump, which is dangerous for vulnerable people.
LGBT are vulnerable with Trump/Pence. Black people. Undocumented people. Hispanic people. Children being torn from their families in ICE centers where they are denied proper medical care and are actively abused. It may not consciously have sinister intentions, I‚Äôd agree...
Sorry even when Nazis die, but maybe now some of his followers will start wearing masks.
Clinton only won it by 1.5%. 538's average has it at 0.7% redder than the national average. If there were an election today, Biden would win it, but if Trump makes up ground, it's certainly one of the states that he could win.
Hay trump is on drugs, it's called "lien".
Wow Trump is a American hero, 'Not' he's using them as props to make himself look good! If you notice Trump never looked at the lady who was crying, cause Trump has not feeling's for people who's hurting!
Fromm the very beginning trump has proved to be unqualified for the office. In contrast Hillary Clinton was over qualified. Don‚Äôt vote on promises! Vote for purpose and experience.

You've Wasted over 3 years of Not coming up with a Health Care Plan. America is ready to turn the channel on the Trump show. Voting Biden on November 3rd.
Trump doesn't want America to see the poor turnout for his nomination.  Many people will stay home and vote online.
Trump is right. Nobody does like him.  He will find out how True that is on November 3rd.
Golfing while America is dying from a preventable death,  if we had the right leadership. Voting Biden.  Time to Dump Trump.
So, different rules for the little rich boys. Trump is a hypocrite.
#YesWeCanAgain just as soon as tRump is gone....we can recover but may take a little while
You want a far left Dem to be the nominee, then convince more voters to agree with your position. We normal center left traditional Dems outnumber you, by a lot!! How many times do we have to prove it. Get trump elected again and the left will NEVER gain an inch in your lifetime
So....we should be more Christ like and support Biden who likes groping kids....all I'm hearing out of liberal nut jobs is pedofiles are okay. As long as they aren't Trump you'll take anything. Also Jesus taught us to love one another not hate your fellow man
Really cause your precious Fauci said he believes Trump prevented a lot of deaths. But tell us since you're an expert what would you have done differently....
I sometimes wonder how the day Trump dies will be. I lowkey don‚Äôt even see him as a human being. The internet might crash like it did when Michael Jackson died except it won‚Äôt be from people searching out of sadness and shock. It‚Äôs gonna be a whole lotta ‚ÄúGO!! GO!! GO!!‚Äù energy.
Wait, do people actually believe this?  I thought everyone knew anyone attributing Sarah Cooper to Trump banning Tik Tok was a joke.
You‚Äôre right. The problem is, Joe is just a miserable person. Trump runs through his head 24/7. What a miserable way to live
Trump was not and is not terrified of Bernie. Trump wanted to run against Bernie so bad he could not contain his excitement at the thought of it, and his anger that it ended up being Biden. The capacity you bernie supporters have for delusion is scary
They really have a problem with messaging.  According to Trump, if they didn't test, then there would be zero cases in Congress.
You're literally telling people if they don't vote Trump, they're voting for evil.  Don't you claim to be a "freethinker" or some dumb shit?
Honey, that was straight up the work of the Clinton‚Äôs and the Royals. How many times was Trump on Epstein‚Äôs flight logs?

He‚Äôs a clown enjoying his new fame. I‚Äôm not defending Trump, but it‚Äôs long past time to put Fauci out to pasture.  ‚ÄúCould change‚Äù my ass.  Either he knew it would or he‚Äôs incompetent.  Hell I thought it would be a problem in January just from reading about the Ch Dr whistleblower
Trump makes it clear how he feels about pedo island back in feb 2015

Trump doesn‚Äôt send police protection to Republican cities because we don‚Äôt tolerate Antifa and violence. Simple facts.
Explain to me how Trump responsible for a pandemic that originated in China? Pelosi was partying in Chinatown and blasting Trump &amp; Fauci‚Äôs recommendations to shelter in place. Covid has been rampant without restraint when social distancing was ignored. Personal responsibility.
I understand your fear about returning to the classroom. Covid has been hard to get under control. Fauci led the charge with guidelines and Birx followed in lock step. Both of them are Democrats. Trump looks to his advisors for policy &amp; Governors had the final word on lockdowns.
Trust me. Knowing President Trump he always has a plan. Just not revealing it right now. Vote your conscience without fear on Nov. 3rd.

These are actually just the next five words in Trump‚Äôs mental acuity test.
"I am here to bear reluctant witness that Mr. Trump didn‚Äôt hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."Here is something from three months ago. But I hadn‚Äôt seen anything about this until that Biden tweet tbh
Another attempt by trump to cheat and win the election.

Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don‚Äôt want the blacks to think that.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump‚Äôs recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won‚Äôt work!
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
I am voting for Trump.

Trump is attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs faith, saying he is ‚Äúagainst God.‚Äù The campaign should make an ad about his faith and how it drives his politics. Trump is the guy that hold a church crowd he doesn‚Äôt ask for forgiveness.

Trump is also the only president who grifts off taxpayers everyday. His family also profits every day. One golf outing costs more than his one year salary. #tfumpisanationaldisaster
True, but either way the Lysol would have killed virus. Trump was right.
Where Nikki Haley  when Trump and Republicans gave the top 1% a tax cut in a growing economy with record corporate profits? You are a hypocrite. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
This should be retweeted daily so we can all be reminded of how despicable the Trump administration is.  How can anyone still believe that Trump cares about anything other than himself &amp; his re-election?
Brilliant wit throwing this back at them concerning the double standard forever applied to President Trump and his supporters.  We‚Äôll likely all die waiting on the resistance to accept election results from 2016, and possibly 2020.
Sharp Joe Biden is on it. Stocks when up 8 consecutive years under Obama. Biden can do it also. Under Trump worst economical downturn in history. Ever!
i am trump supporter but it doesnt look good for his party. it is too difficult to win as Republican because NY and CA carry so many electoral vote
I don‚Äôt like trump and even I believe joe till perform poorly in the debates. He could shock us all if he actually came out looking sharp. Don‚Äôt see it happening.
Trump is a fool. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Trump doesn't possess a rigorous mindset. He tends to blur details when he has to process them quickly at a wholesale level. (And when he doesn't really care much about them. Which is most of the time)  Pelosi is just flat-out lying and knows she is.  There's a difference.
Trump is an outlier, primarily because HRC ran one of the poorer campaigns in US Presidential history.  At least I trust that is the case......
Your just begging for votes you dummy! Latinos and other cultures are not stupid! Stop using pity and ignorance to try and sway the Americans in this country your way. We know what your up to and it‚Äôs not working sleepy Pervy joe! Trump is the way!!!!!!! Your all going to prison!
Keep in mind this is an opinion piece. From who knows where. You‚Äôll get no arguement from me that joe has some mental issues. The debates with trump and Hilary were also pointless. Cmon. Are you really gonna tell me you didn‚Äôt have your mind made up before the debates?
Convoluted Manu by a talking knucklehead.   Trump will chew Ole Joe up and spit him out.

LOL. 155,000 dead in US because Trump lied about the seriousness of the virus. Worst response in the world. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
I am also willing, but I find that the opinion of liberals is based on lies and name-calling. Ex. ‚ÄúTrump has killed thousands of people‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe is a racist.‚ÄùThere is always room for improvement in our institutions, but throwing the baby out with the bath water is not productive.

Trump ran in 2016 on putting together a new health care plan. Nothing. Trump delivered a tax cut for the rich. That is all. #TrumpIsALaughingStock
True.....to the TRUMP VIRUS
When Doug Jones ran against Roy Moore that‚Äôs when I first voted for a Democrat. Jones was the better candidate and Moore was a horrible candidate. I‚Äôve also realized the same about Trump. But if a Republican runs for office and I think he‚Äôs the best candidate I‚Äôll vote for him

Thank you! God bless you for your help in trying to preserve our freedoms, and to re-elect the best President ever, President Trump
President Trump is in  head so bad
Could you maybe pick a time when at least one left-leaning Supreme Court seat isn't likely up for grabs?  If Trump is reelected, the courts will be stacked HARD against a progressive agenda for decades.
This.  A re-elected Trump will overwhelmingly stack the deck for several decades.
Don't let the importance of this next presidential election be understated.  I fully believe that if Trump is reelected in 2020, the deck in the federal courts &amp; including supreme court will be stacked hard against a progressive agenda for decades to come, with no route to fix.
If you are a democrat who sees a path to a presidential election result in 2020 that doesn't re-elect Trump and that doesn't elect the Democrat nominee, by all means enlighten the rest of us.  Many of us are independents who are voting against, not voting for.
What kind of man would sign up to work for Trump? A scum bag, that is who. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
If the liberal commentators had some thoughts as to how to make this country better &amp; unify us instead of Democratic talking points, then I might respect them, but Juan Williams &amp; Donna Brazil don‚Äôt have a clue - just hate Trump &amp; think we supporters are racist &amp; unintelligent.
See how important local elections are?Pay attention to what kind of city, county, state the candidates support. Trump won because he promised America‚Äôs interests first.
Confuse everyone and put the Jones up sign with a trump sign

Show me evidence that the NYTimes covered for the Trump Administration.
Ok then Joe , you had 8 long years to do something and you didn‚Äôt.  Trump has that patented already.
Bro. We know, all the fearful and old Fox News types are voting for Trump.   Still not enough of y‚Äôall.
OMG! I mean I HAD A FEELING TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE A BAD PRESIDENT. BUT I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE THIS HORRIFIC IN SO MANY WAYS. We have GOP SENATE TO THANK. They covered up his crimes in FEBRUARY. THEY MUST PAY WITH THEIR JOBS IN NOVEMBER!!! Again OMG!
I wonder how much sickness and death Trump has to confront before he realizes that it was all born out of his own failed response to the outbreak.
Instead the media has allowed tRump to again chg the narrative. He‚Äôs bragging abt it in a recent tweet. No longer are we talking abt what‚Äôs really urgent- we can only talk abt moving the election and mail in votes. Media is complicit with the worse prez ever! #tRumpvirus
Bernell Trammell. We need to remember his name. He was murdered because he was your supporter. Do all lives matter? Did anyone offer to pay for his funeral? Where is the outrage? I don't like the world I'm living in now. Re-elect Donald J Trump for president. Only hope.
She is a danger and should never be allowed back into the UK. Just my opinion as an American. I guarantee Trump would never allow her to return to the US. She made her bed she can lie in it. I don't care if she was 15 and stupid. Now she's just dangerous.
I'd like to believe that, but with Scotty Bowman and Adam Enre liking Trump tweets, Robin Lehner and Tony Deangelo being known supporters, Tim Thomas being himself, etc. it seems likely split.
I think I would give my left nut before I would vote for Trump!Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
I don't advocate vandalism, but what's good for the goose is good for the gander. How many times has Donald Trump's stars been vandalized?
The largest part of the Trump trolls I run across don't seem to really believe any of their propaganda. They come across as lukewarm about their political views at best. I expect most of the trolls are being paid for their loyalty to Trump.
Trump could use a little humbleness, but thanks to the media he can‚Äôt show any weakness. If he did, they‚Äôd attack him like rabid dogs. Well, kind of like they do now. He‚Äôs been the best thing for the country in years. Go Trump!
Strange how the loudest libs who hate Trump, are also the ones who appear to have something to hide
They were gonna screw with whomever went against Trump.  It doesn't matter if he is in their pocket or just stupid, Putin knows in either case he still wins with Trump and loses with anyone else.
Most trump voters voted to keep Hillary out
and many of those will probably vote for Trump. Just sayin'.
I don't think Trump handled this very well, especially in the beginning. With that said, I think you can attribute these numbers to the selfishness of Americans in general as much if not more than Trump.  There are a lot of selfish bastards in this country.

Trump started out farther ahead in life than I did and maybe farther ahead than you too, but you still don‚Äôt build the organizations he has without being a strong leader.
I don‚Äôt understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can‚Äôt believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.
Don‚Äôt fall for trump antics lol
Let me make this as clear as I can. If you follow Trump and his accomplices, you are not a patriot, you are a traitor, to the U.S. Constitution and to your country and your people.
Trump fans can only dish out insults, vulgarity and slander. That's all they have because that's all they have. There's nothing else in there.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be amazing if trump tweeted ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they‚Äôre spreading false information on social media.‚Äù  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
Put Trump behind bars
Being a lady, I certainly have never passed gas. However, I shall think particularly foul smelling thoughts at trump.
But with all the scandals and the blind support of Trump, it's clear his priority is Jerry, not our University.  It's time for fresh leadership.  He's lucky his father isn't alive to see this.  Dr. Falwell may have been controversial, but he loved Jesus and loved LibertyU.
No, Trump's right. Nobody would do what he's done. Most leaders would never consider outright treason and pushing Nazi Fascism. It's just not done.
And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Trump tells lies in much the same way the rest of us breath air.
I cannot wait for the HUGE NEWS in November! You trump people have nearly ruined this country.

Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.

Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don‚Äôt vote for him even if you can‚Äôt stand his opponent.
I have not heard this term but like it. ‚Äúone-thingism.‚Äù I have referred to many evangelicals having a one trick pony mindset when supporting Trump just because he says he's against abortion and will pack the judicial system with conservative judges. They overlook his many ills.

Cool! Thanks for the vote. I might as well have been one of those stay at home voters last time. Voted 3rd Party (don‚Äôt worry I wasn‚Äôt in a swing state). What I would argue helps complacency is COVID and anger and frustration over Trump for 3.5 years. 1/2
If they have ANY integrity, EVERY "family values" repub should say the same! ......Except they voted for Trump.

Let‚Äôs put an end to the Party of Trump, f/k/a the Republican Party. Vote them all out of every office nationwide. 99% of Republican office holders seem to have forgotten what it once meant to be a member of that party. It can be done. Seen any Whigs running for office lately?
Sorry, to clarify: most people who voted for Trump voted to keep Clinton out and I‚Äôm not going down the rabbit hole of voter fraud with you because the loser always say the election was rigged. Will be the same this Nov.
Your comparing trump to hitler?! That may have come out of your mouth a little too fast and easy before thinking about it. Or you didn‚Äôt have history when you were in school.
Good point. I used the phrase figuratively, not literally. I think Biden is less competent to run a country than Trump, but I would have to give him the nod on getting in. But then again none of us earn a spot so I can‚Äôt speak on that.
COVID is a huge problem. But some folks, especially Trump and his GOP backers pretend that everything is fine. Trump literally just said it is what it is. The US is leading the world in cases and deaths. We as a nation clearly have a problem, but not according to some leadership

Exactly.  Your alternative is Trump - the anti-thesis of American leadership.  You should be leading the conservative choice for Biden - so we can get back to normal debates about tax policy and deregulation not how many Americans should die per day, kids in cages, etc.

grow up and move on.   i swear you cult members need to do your own research and stop depending on the words of others.  when i did my research, i learned a lot like never to be for trump again
do your research. trump is refusing to submit his dna
what's trump's excuse?  i'm appalled at how many women are supporting a man that's been accused of rape by multiple women.  it makes absolutely no sense
i mean biden does have 24 women claiming he raped them and plus refuse to give his dna, biden also was fined twice for refusing to rent to minorities, plus biden has locked up hundreds of hispanics in cages like animals ...oh nm... that was trump
yes but at least he's not an evil lying rapist so if he gets elected, he can have his bouts of memory lapses as long as he don't act like trump
message me...lol.. i'll argue for awhile then i'll block them when they get on my nerves too bad.  realize you can't win with them, they are cult members.  they worship trump

we aren't as diverse as latinos.  look let's not pretend biden is the best choice, he's the only choice though.  trump would see us all locked up in chains or lynched.  but when you go to a black community, it's mostly black americans. when you go to a latin community, there ....

child, if biden sat in a corner rocking back and forward, he would still be better than trump and would have my vote
the crazy part about it, trump stands for most things God is against, the prideful, self lover, liar, he has the blood of 180,000 people on his hands, adulterer, the list goes on and on

so here we go blaming obama again when trump was the one that ordered them thrown in there.  i swear ya'll worship that man. it's ridiculous. obama been gone, the next hurricane is obama's fault also
if you have the money to afford a place in trump towers, you'd have trouble getting in.  he was fined twice for not renting to minorities
you should be asking what he's going to do for the country in general to bridge the gap that trump has created.  we need to get covid under control, then he needs to speak to the people to unite them, so stop being selfish and go vote for the idiot in office but remember this...
so biden is demented and trump is mentally stable??  um... i think both have some dementia but trump is just pure evil with his.
another fool who thinks pouring gasoline on a fire is the way to extinguish it.  how much is trump paying you to be his personal ball sack
Donald Trump.. not a big national park guy eh?
President Donald Trump said Monday he had fired Tennessee Valley Authority chairman and Decatur resident Skip Thompson, criticizing the federally owned corporation for hiring foreign workers and overpaying its chief executive officer.
no you allow trump to dictate how you think and feel. a true leader does not throw gasoline on a fire to try and extinguish it. what amazes me is all of the racist views coming at black american but then the sames ones with the racist views say "but i'm not a racist"
Falling off the Trump Train as Trump fires and destroys another good person by firing the wrong TVA person because he can‚Äôt get at the CEO. What a rotten pattern.
To each there own, but isn‚Äôt it cringe how hardcore trump supporters really believe ‚ÄúGod‚Äù only loves America?
An insecure narcissistic control freak, AKA Donald Trump?!!
Because Trump is afraid that if everyone gets to vote safely, he‚Äôll lose their election?
That‚Äôs what we need for everyone to be part of the decision! Trump wants those most often disenfranchised to have great difficulty voting, as they‚Äôre most likely not to vote for him!
Never even saw the targeted to  survey. But Dr Fauci hasn‚Äôt seen a patient in over 20 years &amp; he‚Äôs simply an unelected Gov employee. Trump is advised by many - not just left leaning Dr Fauci.
Too late Michael. Everyone knows the latest Trump interview is out there, and they are waiting to see what you were prompting him to say!! ü§´ü§´ü§´
here we go again.  dang you deflected about trump and went on a rant about blm.  then you brought up that one of the officers was black.  then someone else reminded you that the officer that killed mr. george floyd was white,
no you pulled out the race card when you started about blm...lol deflect then try to flip it...lmfao.  does it matter what race the police are if they're doing their job correctly? typical trump playbook.  keep trying.
the problem is, he has no point.  he is just deflecting from the facts that trump is a complete failure. trump does the same thing, we you call him on his iss, he starts rambling about blm or china.  trump and #Cult45 can't stick the facts
Not true, trump hired his own people to investigate voter fraud, his own people found found 3 instances of voter fraud in the last 20 years.
still waiting on your relevant point.  the typical deflecting racist.  let's not focus on the real issues, let's focus on blm...lol hey but let's ignore the 150,000 lives lost and putin's bounty on our military.  let's ignore the numerous times trump has been caught in lies......
killed by racist police officers.  let's not focus om the 150,000 dead because of trump's negligence, when it's brought up let's just talk about blm... just like sheep led to the slaughter. he told ya'll no mask and you believed him
you aren't too smart are you?  you worship trump and his racist actions.  you think it's ok to kill a man just because he has a criminal record. that's the whole #cult45 mentality.  let's ignore the wrong trump and his minions do but focus on black people tired of being.....
yes, the trump rallies, trump encouraging people not to wear mask because it was a symbol against him, yes large magnitude because ya'll can't think for yourselves. you believe every single thing he says.  the blm movement, we can think for ourselves and speak out when we....
i don't live in nyc and i'm sooo anti-trump but cuomo did a horrible job.  he's just as guilty as trump but i love hearing his brother on tv
trump is a terrorist
but going to spread the virus, ohh i meant trump rally was ok?  you do know about tulsa right? oh i forgot you forgot your god infected tulsa
if you were to ask trump himself wtf he was talking about, HE wouldn't even know.  how can they let him finish out his term?  he clearly isn't mentally stable
trump wants people to donate "plausma"  lol.. what an idiot #WomenAgainstTrump #EndTheNightmare #TrumpVirus
maybe you should think for yourself and stop letting trump tell you what to think.  if you think protesting police brutality is terroristic  then you seriously are a racist
President Donald Trump said today that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority, claiming the federal agency has betrayed American workers.
yeah but trump did things worth suing over
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton‚Äôs ex-WH spokesman says
and let's keep the man free who's negligence has led to over 150,000 people's deaths.  trump is the most prolific serial killer in the united states
and i'm not a big fan of joe biden but would vote for a shoe box before i'd vote for trump
#Cult45  can't think for themselves.  they have to agree with EVERYTHING trump says and does.   they are even willing to sacrifice their own kids and lives for him.  trump exhibits signs of mental instability daily. trump is everything that's wrong with the country  now
After what these jackasses did to Yovonavich, Hill &amp; Vindman &amp; his brother give them any job they want. Sondland, Grenell, Dejoy, Perry, Mulvaney, &amp; all these others who paid trump to put them in rolls in his swamp move them to Siberia. They w/ love Putin since they no gd to him
Nope. Truth has been their downfall long before Trump.
like you would know who God is!!! you follow a racist tyrant.  those the video is vulgar, i think it isn't any worse than you worshipping a racist troll named trump!!! now that's horrible and disrespectful!!!!!
everyone should have voted for Deez Nuts instead of trump, at least it would have been slightly amusing.  trump is murderous
Our teachers are so underrated. People still don't understand the value of their job to teach the next generation, and the next, and so on. Without teachers we will surely become the Idiocracy that Trump wants us to be.
I know Trump didn't say that, because it's the truth.
oh biden is worse?? um trump was fined 2 times for not renting to minorities, and he was told about the bounties on multiple occasions, he just was too busy golfing
are you forgetting epstein and trump wishing her well?  you #Cult45  don't even use the slightest bit of common sense to see what's really going on
claimed Loomer &amp; others created the false flag about bombers  being Trump supporters - then ‚Äúhashtag "#MAGABomber" began trending on Twitter, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, "MAGA" (Make America Great Again).[114][115][116]‚Äù sounds like Loomer was right
the problem is they hadn't guzzled the right amount of kool-aid.   they believe every single thing trump says and does is absolutely correct. they worship him. they would sacrifice their children to him
and here comes the trump cult members...lmfao...
Also Trump did not know the bank had been so throughly robbed, that  so ineptly handeled the situation, &amp; many other things were broken when Trump began office requiring attention.
Nope wrong again:
Well said. We all know, the lesser of two evils but that pretty much qualifies 99 percent of all human beings as the lesser evil. Compared to Trump one would really have to be a true monster to be worse.
Odd how  had almost 50 years (8 as a VP) to root out ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù  and did NOTHING. Yet  claims  as a racist when Trump DID SOMETHING in 3 years, making the highest employment for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in HISTORY!

you're kidding right?  when he's been saying it for months and months, no i take that back, years.  when the first protest started way back he said the same thing.  if you vote for trump, vote for him but stop being mindless and believing every single things he says.
to trumpeteers, if trump offers you kool-aid, please drink it, drink as much of it as you can

glad your eyes are now open because i always think anybody that fights or have fought for us are number 1.  i respect vets so much but gained more respect if that's possible to the vets who may not be for blm but stood in protest with them against trump's war on civilians.
Trump threatens America with the highest employment in HISTORY for blacks, Asians, &amp; Hispanics. Plus the highest employment of women in over 70 years.

talk about window licker.  if trump had of shut the country down in the beginning for about a month, this would have been just a bad memory. due to his lack of response, we are still suffering with covid. trump just isn't too bright
I think it‚Äôd be the other way around! Trump doesn‚Äôt have the courage to have a good debate.

Plus, by avoiding prosecution in another country, he can still continue to sow discord and reap whatever financial benefits he can from what remains of his business.  Trump isn't running for President.  He's running to avoid prison.
It sounds fantastic.  I know.    But, there's nothing left for Trump in America except for countless lawsuits.  If he stays in America, he'll spend the rest of his life in court fighting to avoid prison.  If he's convicted of anything, he'll likely die in prison.
The pilot would have to comply since Trump would still be Commander In Chief.    From that airport, Trump can take ground transportation to wherever he's arranged for asylum.  Moscow wouldn't be out of the question.

Reich is wrong, though.  Pence can't pardon Trump of crimes he hasn't been tried for or prosecuted of.  That's not going to happen between Election Day and Inauguration.
This is a bad take.  A.  Trump would have to be found guilty of a federal crime before he could be pardoned of it.  That won't happen between now and inauguration.  B.  Even then, Pence would only be able to pardon Trump of federal crimes; not state-level.

See and that's exactly where we differ in opinion. I do not believe that Biden is even a little better than Trump.  And I refuse to vote the lesser of two evils. If the Democratic party wants my vote they need to run a candidate I believe in.
And I get it you're willing to vote for Biden because you believe that there is some legitimate difference between him and Trump. I don't. Deal with it.
I don't vote against candidates I vote for candidates. So instead of trying to explain to me why I need to vote against Trump explain to me why I should vote for Biden without mentioning Trump.
Sorry but if your best argument for Biden is "but Trump" you're engaging in a futile effort with me. I don't negotiate with terrorists.
Literally every reason I won't support Trump are the same reasons I won't support biden. And telling me I have to support Biden is like someone trying to convince you you have to support Trump. It's a total waste of time.

The original reply was because you said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about Trump‚Äù correct? It‚Äôs just a response to what you stated. The kneeling had been going on before Trump. But you blame him. The coronavirus started in China. But you blame him. He is not perfect, but you are ridiculous

Only reason for election being close would be from the Left's cheating.  Democrats will pull out all stops! There's no filthy corruption or demonic evil they would consider beneath them; dangerous to our Republic. I pray Trump has his own bodyguards augmenting his SS protection.
Can‚Äôt stand trump, the schmuck!
We expect rabid nonsense from Democrats. But Feckless Republicans have permitted the persecution of Trump from day 1. Lil Jeff Sessions could've put his foot down as AG, instead he left President out to dry on utterly corrupt criminal activity from DOJ, FBI, FISA, CIA, Congress..
You're arguing against a strawman- exactly like Trump does! You know I never said, or even implied, anything about "the folks who work for" Yellawood. Serious question: did you laugh as you typed "Trust me" bc you know i 100% agree ü§£ü§£... still ‚ù§ you man, but wow
D.A. Is Investigating Trump and His Company Over Fraud, Filing Suggests
If Biden wins, the establishment will sit here and say ‚Äúsee Bernie could never have done that‚Äù. When in reality, the only reason he‚Äôs doing so well is because of covid. If it was Bernie vs Trump, it would be a landslide for Bernie.
A low death rate as a percentage of cases is a testament to our medical community, not Trump.  A high death rate as a percentage of population is a testament to the abject failure of our leadership coupled with citizens rejecting science for hoax  crack.
If you dont want to be chased by men with guns whether its civillians or cops i have a fantastic idea for you... Stop breaking the fucking law. And also trump doesnt need to be moral as the government is not a moral institutionand if he is such a clown hows he doing so great
Arbery was casing houses to steal from he was chased and citizens attempted to detain him he then charged a man and grabbed his shotgun.... What exactly do you think he was gonna do if he got that gun and trump is an amazing president hes not a hero hes a great leader
Interesting. So.. what about those bounties?? Even IF Trump didn‚Äôt know anything about it (he did), why hasn‚Äôt he still done anything about it?
Brianna taylor was wrong and the cops should be charged however arbery was a justified shooting hence why the media went quiet on it there was no way to spin it and trump doesnt cause stress hes done a better job then most who ever held that office
Trump would finally get the [real] crowd size he wants
No i think he lived a criminal lifestyle and danced on the razor edge of a death that sooner or later was going to happen and the media spun it into a race war to gin up a protest that quickly got out of control turned into a riot and then they capatilized on that to blame trump
‚ÄúI took a threesome for two weeks.‚Äù  - Donald Trump  Sorry, the immature kid in me won‚Äôt let this one go
Said and done worse? Ummm when and where because thats not true trump is not a racist
Trump wouldn't even have to utter a word.
Is Donald Trump a Politician?
If Tik Tok gets banned, I will never get to post my dance rendition of the latest trendy song. How dare you, Trump!
Moments ago: Trump to sign executive order on hiring American workers  via
‚ÄúSo even though I had voted Republican in every presidential election since 1976, I changed my voter registration to independent and I will be voting for  in November.‚Äù
Why are we surprised Trump lied about his crowd size in Florida and Texas. It‚Äôs literally the first thing he did in office.  #TrumpIsLosing
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining #ProtectTheResults:
GOP: Renomination of Trump to be held in private
Photo shopped picture not even a good one at that. The picture of trump kissing his daughter was taken in 93 at the grand opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe. Taken by photo journalist Ron Gallela. This is the original.
I'm glad Trump closed the borders to china when he did  even though he was called a xenophobe he knew it would get worse if he didn't.
In spite of all evidence to the contrary, let‚Äôs assume, solely for the sake of argument, That HUNTER had corruptly received money from Ukraine. What office is he running for? Who‚Äôs vote is he trying to earn? And exactly how would that be different from the Trump kids..,?
Make America Great Again with Trump 2020 ! We Love our great President Trump, his family &amp; his Administration - he is the 2nd American Cyrus who‚Äôs God appointed and anointed to be the protector of America‚Äôs Ancient foundations - Pray for God‚Äôs agenda to be achieved through him!
maybe you should do some soul searching son. he's done more for this country than any pres in 20 yrs.
This is how I feel about trump worrying about tik tok right now lol
Like Gen Z wasn't already coming for him hard enough? #tiktokban
So did anyone else notice that the police and sheriff escorts for the Trump and confederate caravans in Florence AL tonight didn‚Äôt ticket or arrest anyone for using their phone to record video while driving?
Project Say Something‚Äôs protest against the Confederate monument outside the Lauderdale County Courthouse ended peacefully tonight. Counter-protesters drove through downtown flying Confederate, Blue Lives Matter and Trump 2020 flags off their pickup trucks.
I no longer have to wonder what our Grand Country would be like if it were run by the Mob, it already has been since January 20, 2017 !  Just watch Donald Trump, he acts like a mob member EVERY DAY !
Protesters fill the Lauderdale County Courthouse plaza for Project Say Something‚Äôs Occupy Downtown: Unite Against the Klan protest. Counter protesters have also shown up circling the courthouse with Confederate flags and Trump 2020 flags.
Donald Trump loves only himself, I don't know about who or what he hates. He is using America to make more money, to weaken America so that someday Putin (Trump's banker before and after the presidency) &amp; friends can jet in and conquer America.
Black woman is the only one making sense.
Isn‚Äôt this the trump you talking about?
Another reason for constitutional conservatives to decline to vote for Trump so it will not be close.
Saw a lady in Walmart with a "Women for Trump" shirt.
Keem is the Trump of Epsorts. Literally read that in trumps voice. Sad!
Banning HCQ cure is TDS on steroids.  If Trump had originally vilified it, we'd be OK to purchase HCQ over the counter at a local deli.
It's also convenient when a news channel twists everything.. cough cough  CNN, NBC, MSNBC, ABC, ETC. You sont think this country is controlled by the media? They show you what they want you believe and see. Open your ignorant eyes. Trump isn't the problem, it's the Media.
If y‚Äôall really think President Trump was serious and not throwing the media for a loop to mess with them then yeah y‚Äôall are pretty stupid...
Trump is a genius, he put that out there so that the media and the Democrats will get behind not postponing the election!
Well gee lets take a wild stab as to why people dont want to listen to yet another sjw whine about the lie of trump being a bad president bcuz its not like we haven't been hearing that for four goddamn years and certainly gonna hear it another four when he is definitely reelected
What is your opinion about the possiblity that Trump would try to have the post master general (that he just appointed) claim that mail in ballots from certain (dem) cities in swing states are invalid bc of voter fraud or etc? He would try to do that to tip the election.
Omg all I have to do to be successful is to start a business and say how great trump is biiiiiitch...
I like how you can look back on interviews with Trump and his positions and views haven‚Äôt changed.  He wants America to do better and stop being taken advantage of.  You look back at Biden and his time in office and especially the senate and he is clearly racist but he‚Äôs changed
I have been a Republican all of my adult life.  But Trump and some of his followers are making me seriously rethink my allegiance to the GOP
I‚Äôll answer that for you:  JFK (D), Hoover (D)  and yes your President, President Trump (R). So yeah he has NO financial motive as president.  Unlike Obama, Biden, Pelosi, Schiff (well all Democrats so I‚Äôll save some reading for you).
So your doing more commercials ? Let‚Äôs see beans and pizza what‚Äôs else... oh yea corona . God damn idiot trump
96 Days till the election.  Trounce Trump and vote.
Wonder why they want to ban  Hydroxychloroquine? Other than saving lives, HCQ ends it all. No lockdowns  Schools churches businesses restaurants economy open market surges...  Nope. Trump hating Democrats won't stand for it.
The Virus suddenly disappears? Right? Bwhahahahaha Trump is a GENIUS !
Trump demands money to renovate the White House in the coronavirus bill: report
I don‚Äôt blame you Vote for Trump he and We The People believe in you heroes God bless our Police from sea to shining sea Amen üôè
I can think of a lot more reasons why the big pharmaceutical and Democrats are against it.  If it‚Äôs true Trump was right all along and they have the deaths on their hands.
‚ÄùAmerica First‚Äù for Trump is we should turn a blind eye to intelligence reports of Russian bounties on soldiers because we armed Afghans who fought the Soviets in the 1970‚Äôs.
Please take Trump's plan to move troops out of Germany seriously and stop him !
IF this plan occurs,it will be a continuation of Trump/Putin plans to weaken America inside &amp; outside our borders! I pray Americans will understand this and   you and all military people will explain this to American families so they will vote him out!
Barr faked his way through the entire day. He is a criminal the same as Trump is.  They ARE working together to weaken America. We need to work together to encourage a gigantic wave of votes to oust Trump thereby ridding ourselves of Barr at the same time!
McConnell is responsible for the power that Trump has now, at this very moment.  They planned it for many years, including Obama's term.
The Covid Test should be as fast as Gohmer's. It could be working fast right now for all of us,but,Putin's pressure on Trump to harm America"s people, Constitution,Rule of Law, health,education, living spaces, finances and way of life has caused our greatness begin to crumble!
He offends me deeply too!  I love my country and all the people in it. Think of all the people who would still be alive right this very moment if Trump had used his brain, or allowed someone else with a brain to lead us into this virus war.Aww. Today's poll showed Trump over Biden by 3. üêòüíØ
Second debate just about water. Water pressure. Who can drink a glass of water most gracefully. Who flushes the toilet the most times. Maybe even address the water crisis in Flint if they could get Trump to agree to it.
Now do a billboard for the elderly Trump supporter who was murdered in Detroit for kicks just because he advertised his support for Trump. We *see* youüò∂
Cocktails with Trump. Thousands dead Millions without work The President have a rally with cocktails for his Private Country Club Members.
Knowing what Trump is and capable of, no amount would. I would not be able to live with myself, as the destruction of the country and church is assured. I didn't vote for him in 2016 and I hope that he and his ilk will be excised from public forum.
Cocktails with Donald Trump. Thousands of Americans dead Millions of Americans without work. The President have a cocktail rally at his private golf resort.
So trump is going to dismantle Obamacare for Obamacare?
What Republicans? They are going to be routed just as trump is.
This is absolutely horrible!! Trump did all he could do to destroy Obamacare.  He FAILED!! "Southern Political Segregation" states even refused $billions of dollars by Expanding Medicaid because it's an Obama contribution. Now Trump wants to take credit for it. Sickening!!
I don‚Äôt see how ANYONE can look at what Dems are doing and promoting and call anything Trump is doing a shit show!!
If trump hoping to send his tweets written on balloons?
Question? Does trump read?
Thanks for this. While many r excited 2 vote Trump out, there has been 2 little attention on the change in current toxic culture. I'm really glad to see someone look forward. I do have some q's. How do we change smthg like Fox &amp; OANN? How do we effectively move away from racism?
Anyone stupid enough to vote for Kanye West for POTUS should keep it very quiet, keep it to yourself.   Trump is putting west on the ballot to get stupid people hopefully to vote far west instead of Biden. West will take votes from Trump, not Biden. Biden supporters are not DUMB!
If Trump can bankrupt a casino people should be able to bankrupt on a student loan.
I did a spit-take with my glass of Trump wine so I think it‚Äôs got staying power.
When it comes to trump supporters, they are clueless about everything Obama did for this country and how trump claimed all of Obama‚Äôs accomplishments and dragged them all into the ground.
in an actual debate with Trump.
Well trump has shown they have their lives to lose by ignoring the coronavirus epidemic.
No Joe, that was you. I know it‚Äôs hard to keep facts straight. Here‚Äôs your and Obama‚Äôs impact on manufacturing
I doubt if trump wants to lose, he literally thinks being a bad ass will keep his supporters in line. What a dufus.
The left and media claimed falsely that Trump worked with a forgiven government to get elected and now you are complaining that Trump is going to do the same without any evidence. Liberalism is a mental disorder.
So trump‚Äôs last gasp of breath is to ride on Barack Obama‚Äôs coattails? He‚Äôs already screwed up other Obama‚Äôs accomplishments.

Be as ruthless against the rich as trump has been against the poor and middle class. It‚Äôs us that that created the United States from the sweat of our brows not the wealthy
Another attempt by trump to cheat and win the election.

‚Äúfind something new to hate her for‚Äù  I mean shit, that would be plenty enough for me‚Äîeven without all of her deep sense of appreciation for the russian president, her meetings with the trump campaign, her present vote in the impeachment of DJT, etc  find a clue
Uh, yeah.
Another example if how dumb Trump is.  He just says whatever comes out of his mouth regarding how stupid it sounds.
I think he pretty much got the job because he will lie. He will also hire a hooker and not pay child support which makes he super qualified for the Trump administration.
Really tired of seeing folks saying Biden and Trump are the same. The hell the are! Ask your self if they would appoint the same people to the SCOTUS. There. Fixed it for you.
In order to defeat  ,  is going to run as a Democrat.   I didn‚Äôt see take coming.   Trump will do anything to stay out of jail.
Trump supports Obama Care!
Yeah, it is already the law. The law Trump has been fighting in court to get rid of. I guess he forgot he was so busy thinking about Thighland.
Trump cursed black athletes. He bashes black politicians and residents on their Districts. He bashes predominantly black cities. He has been sued for housing discrimination. Now he's terrifying white suburbanites that low income minorities will destroy their communities.
I fully agree, but again, my hope is that its prevalence &amp; pervasiveness aren‚Äôt so deeply-rooted that it literally forces this nation into a second trump term. I‚Äôm not sure how systemic the issue is within the party, but it better not fuck this up. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.
The people on this thread are the reason why this country is falling apart.  Trump is right. You socialist idiots are insane.
You have the candidates confused. Not Biden, but Trump who lies so often that I sometimes think he believes his own lies.
At this point if you vote for Donald Trump your a goddamn idiot
Daily reminder that you can be vehemently anti-Trump and still not resort to slut shaming when mentioning Melania.‚úåüèª
Heidi: To help you understand how President Trump won in 2016, read the Constitution. As for Russian help, it was all to Hillery, ‚Äî after nearly 49 M wasted, Mueller could not any evidence of Russian help to our President. Recommendation-time to grow up &amp; stop believing Dims.
did someone hit Trump with a Haldol dart before he walked to the podium? #Bedminster #TrumpIsNotWell

There isn‚Äôt enough money in the world to make me go see trump.
What a pathetic and vile response. Must be a Trump supporter.
Hopefully citizens in Florida and Texas will ask themselves why trump is helping just them. Is trump trying to give bribes and favors for votes?
HAPPENING NOW:  President Trump holds a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey
Congress needs to use the 25th amendment and remove Trump from office. If the republicans hope to win any elections in November 2020, removing Trump from office might be their only hope to try to turn the tide. Otherwise, it‚Äôs over for the republicans.
We will never know.   said his glass as full of ‚ÄúBlack water‚Äù not wine. And both he and that young ladies pants were unzipped because they didn‚Äôt fit.  No one ask why their pants were off, just accepted the excuse.  media lets Trump get away with lies, not you
more Fuck‚Äôn lying!! Ur a lying liberal MF‚Äôer.. Trump lives in ur little pee brain rent free ü§°
STFU.. if ur mouth is moving ur lying ü§• Trump is going to beat #BeijingBiden like a drum!!
Trump managed to fuck up THE POST OFFICE.
The FDA will be required to develop a list of essential medicines covered under the order. At a minimum, the order will apply to drugs and supplies needed to combat emergencies such as pandemics, bioterror attacks and other threats. |
They are calling out your lies and deceit. You people lack any morals or integrity. You have sold your souls to devil trump.
Press corps.  Please walk out on this ‚Äúpress conference‚Äù where trump has assembled members to be a cheering section.  No masks.  No distancing.  Please.  Don‚Äôt give him the audience in the press he craves.
Franklin Graham is somewhere scared to death now. Graham along with several other "so-called" evangelicals committed blasphemy and had the audacity to say that God sent Trump. Absolutely disgusting!!
LIVE NOW: President Trump holds a briefing.
Let trump be trump.   Look we‚Äôre that has landed usü§Ø
I don't watch cable news but I do know that with the asset forfeitures from Manafort that Mueller turned a profit and that he explicitly did not exonerate Trump and that he cited multiple instances of obstruction of justice.
Trump is no AntiChrist, Trump is a con-artist and his followers are fools.
‚ÄúStep back and remember the big picture. What were Obama &amp; Co. so *desperate* to keep hidden if Trump won the election?‚Äù
Sir, you have my support.  But Stuart Stevens has a great idea.  You need a commercial that simply says, ‚ÄúDonal Trump has failed as President.  And his actions and lack of actions is costing you the lives of your loved ones and those you know ‚Äú.
Steven Stevens just summed up this presidential race.  Donald Trump has failed as President and it costing you the lives of your loved ones and people you know.   It‚Äôs just that simple.  And that needs to be said over and over and over, everyday!
Hold on a minute what about Clinton and Obama??? They are secular and made millions off of Wall Street handouts. Reagan, Bush, and Trump may have pandered to the Christian Right to get elected but what did any of them actually do that actually benefitted the Christian Right???
Yeah, I‚Äôve had journalists post more deranged ones. I get the same vibe from the way they do the Trump ads I see everywhere. Almost all of them are not designed to actually try to convince anyone to vote for him!
Trump is trying to take credit for anything that is going on positive N this country whether he is remotely close to it or not so he can try 2 get his base hyped up. We can't give this P.O.S credit 4 anything cuz he HATES people he's a Nazi. Nazis don't belong in our country.
Another follow.  I‚Äôm in ü§™
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn‚Äôt trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can‚Äôt fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We‚Äôve got to find better people to run.
Pathetic,  I can hardly wait to hear you join in n the communal howl at the sky when president Trump is easily reelected. Btw, gfy you Russian dupe!
Few people may "Bible Trump" and "Profess the Military" but other than the military part it has no true affect on our political system. The Christian Right has lost every battle they've gotten in since the 1960s and America has since declined into a Post-Christian secular state.
I like how you‚Äôre trying to deflect to yet another lie but my question remains, would you have been ok with him not being caught? I‚Äôd guess if he was caught later on you‚Äôd blame Obama for not warning trump. Am I wrong?
Underfunding the Post Office is part of Trump‚Äôs campaign strategy.
You might explore the records before you call someone more of a criminal than Trump.  Abundance of evidence to the contrary. You seem to be stuck in your own fortified cave with your blinders on.  Go ahead cuss at me some more that will prove your point.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
I haven‚Äôt forgotten this: ‚ÄúEvangelical Jerry Falwell Jr. to head Trump education task force‚Äù l Reuters
I followed you. Any road that Trumpty Dumpty is on leads to Putin and his communist russian mafia gangsters. But the Chinese and the Iranians hate Trump. They may actually try to help Trump lose and help Biden win.  Any way that Trump loses works for me.
I would be interested in seeing Congress take the opportunity to consult the American people on proposed legislation, pass a law with a veto-proof majority, and then give Trump the job of enforcing it, instead of "negotiating" with Steven Mnuchin.
American has had Pandemics before, World Wars before, Stock Market Crashes before.  Historically speaking, this is not new.  What America has not had is  ,  Trump is new and the results are disastrous.  This is textbook - "FAILED LEADERSHIP"
He thinks Trump is going to come to his rescue.  Hopefully the board of trustees do the right thing though I could reslly care less. MY CONSCIENCE: Then why are you tweeting about this.  Take a nap Willie .
This is unfortunately all too true. Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump‚Äôs failures - The Washington Post
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
This is an incredible simplification of Trump voters. Generalizations like this are not helpful and in a world which desperately needs reconciliation I‚Äôm surprised at this post. Some people vote on policies not personality. Trump voters aren‚Äôt monolithic!
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don‚Äôt want the blacks to think that.
Reverend reveals what evangelicals say privately about Trump  via
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump‚Äôs recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won‚Äôt work!
It's election season and Dipshitdonnie is losing.  He lost the #Vets4Trump and he is allowing Pompeo to make meaningless public statements that Trump himself can deny and ignore.  Only a moron would believe Trump would ever stand up to Putin.   Never has / Never will
Have you listen to trump trying to read what‚Äôs put in front of him? I submit Thighland and Yo See MITE from his recent attempts just this week. What day ye?
If anyone ask, "Where are all the NEW Manufacturing jobs  promised with his Tax give away for the rich and his Failed Trade-war?" They're in China and Vietnam, exactly where they always were.  Trump didn't bring them back, they just moved around within Asia.
The fact that Trump still has voters simply shows us how broken we are as a nation. A lot of Americans embrace racism, exploitation of the poor and the marginalization of LGBTQ+ persons. They seem to have zero empathy.
Trump really cares more about tiktok than Covid hahaha what world do we live in ?!
I think the real reason why Trump wants to take Tic-Toc down is because intelligence data shows China  election interference is anti-Trump. Russia‚Äôs is on Trumps side so putting bounties on US soldiers is OK with him.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Yes, If I‚Äôve learned anything from Twitter it is that you can‚Äôt use facts, truth and logic on Trump supporters.  Doesn‚Äôt work.  If it did, they would‚Äônt be dining  on meals of Tucker Carlson and flirting with ‚ÄúQ‚Äù.  But if you have swamp land to sell, you may find a buyer there.
Trump uses God exactly as he uses people. As a pawn and a ploy. Trump is un-Christian based on his statements and behavior.
It‚Äôs going to be a landslide. I‚Äôm 63 voting for the first time. I believe there are many more like me. Dems will hold their nose and vote their pocket book (Trump) or sit it out.
#Biden shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to debates until #trump released tax returns
Republicans: SEE CHINA AND IRAN BACK BIDEN!!!! SOCIALIST  Democrats: SEE RUSSIA WANTS TRUMP TO WIN!!!! COLLUSION  The rest of us: üòë  The two party system failed us. How about we just do the right thing and secure our elections from all foreign nations?
On the short term, orange man bad vote blue is probably the only strategy toward anything resembling progressive policy. It's too late in the game to risk 4 more years of Trump. I want a student loan plan and healthcare too. Trump will mean neither. Biden might mean some.
Trump is the best president
The truth behind this is really questionable. First Trump says it was a hoax, then as pressure mounts for weeks, Pompeo says he warned Russia about it, but this is just now being disclosed. Can we see a transcript of the call or have some verification by those who listened in?
Mercy. I'm having the same thoughts I did about this time in 2016 when it was Clinton vs. Trump. I always try to be an optimist, but the choices in November have me using this emoji quite often &gt;&gt;ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*With GOP Hubby Andrea Mitchell(  ) with her focus on Clinton EMAILS Everyday(EVERYDAY) helping Elect Trump- She would do less Damage if she were on FOX News
These assurances come from a totally unqualified, inexperienced Trump sycophant, a donor who was repaid with a government appointment. We can only hope that he is not just another Republican trying to undermine the voting process, but he clearly takes his orders from Trump.
Except when putin wants to kill Americans - Putin First The trump klan are all cowards. The only reason their ancestor immigrated here was to get out of military service in Germany.  Cowardice is in their DNA
No stimulus checks, unemployment boost? Last-ditch virus aid talks as Trump team back to Capitol
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.

You have no back to back up your claims. In fact you‚Äôre spreading misinformation. Tree I think Twitter and Facebook does not allow that. Maybe better clean up your act and get your facts straight. Donald Trump is beating you at your own game.
The poor guy can't stop himself from projecting.   If we promised Trump $1million in cash, 2 barely legal Russian mail order brides, and bag of Big-Macs if he goes 1 week w/out projecting, he'd lose every time. He can't help himself.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment

Hey  I'm just curious, can you name ANY hotels that are built w/o money from oligarchs? Lol, course not. Perhaps we should try Trump for his actual crimes instead of trying to blame Russians for our own criminal cabals?
Nope...it is the underlying condition of being a leader is that you are responsible for the decisions you make and how it affects others or the situation.  Trump can deny responsibility all he wants, but the fact is:  the buck stops there!!

I'm holding out hope that McGahn is one of the good ones however few and far between they might be. I seem to remember he had some disagreement with Trump about how being WH counsel isn't the same as being Trump's lawyer.
Are you implying that Donald J. Trump‚Äôs administration has managed the COVID-19 response better than Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs administration? Please provide evidence to you your claims. Joe Biden‚Äôs commercial tells the story of elderly Floridians who are not able to see their grandkids.
Do you want vote by mail so you can corrupt the election. If you think about health or anything else it‚Äôs about your grab for power. Also you didn‚Äôt like When you were ask a real question by PBS. She is not a Trump advocate. You just got caught in a lie. Out the door with you

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he will not stand in the way of prosecution against President Trump from the Justice Department if he is elected. -
Voting for trump? That‚Äôs what hurts to know that many people are simply that stupid
My dad didn‚Äôt want to put on his mask and I was like ‚Äúokay trump‚Äù and it was a good joke my whole fam laughed
Holy shit.  I wonder if Trump talked him into the hairstyle while playing golf with him a few weeks ago.
Besides Donald Trump, how about Vladimir Putin and his henchmen, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, and the republicans in the senate who kiss Putin‚Äôs ass seven times a day facing towards the kremlin. And don‚Äôt forget the head asskisser, Mike Pence.
GOP‚Äôs Senators opposition to a relief package is pretty clear sign they expect Trump to lose. If they thought he had a chance they would be signing on to a bigger package. This seems to be about setting the stage to oppose Biden.
TikTok is threatening legal action over President Trump's exectuive order to ban the Chinese social media app from doing business in the U.S. -
Yes, this is common sense, but what is also common sense is that Trump is American with an American accent. Americans dont pronounce Thailand this way. Dinesh is also trying to say most of the English speaking countries do. It appears people from most of those countries disagree.
Parents need to speak out.....and this right here is why Trump needs to go.  Fascism in the WH of the United States of America.....
It just gets uglier and uglier. If Joe would just smile at the camera and be quiet, his resume and Trump's craziness could help him win. Instead, it's feeling more and more like we just need a reset button. Our (Democrats) hope lies in the VP choice I'm afraid
Trump should be strapped with term #PandemicBotchery
Say what you want about Trump in that photo but man that kid does not know how to cut grass.
I still rubs me wrong knowing that Richard Nixon's signature is on my discharge documents. I can't even imagine how badly the current military folks feel knowing that they want to live with Trump's on theirs!
Trump has lots of rough edges. He‚Äôs far from the ideal man.Same as me. But he beats, by far, anything or anybody the left has to offer.

"On Thursday night, Trump signed two executive orders that'll enable the U.S. Commerce Secretary to punish American companies and individuals found in violation with $1 million fines and possible imprisonment."  Here is the full article if you choose to read it! #glenmalone2
Also, why be hesitant when Trump is shattering all Republican norms and principles?
you never see the headline "Trump clarifies remarks".
a PULLBACK from the gains of May and June and evidence that the resurgent coronavirus IS SLOWING HIRING and the economic rebound.   Trump say "By the end of Summer American will be back Stronger than ever".   TicToc
Trump really bout to ban an appüò≠ WHOSE MANS IS THIS???
Trump supporters are the goddamn worst!
Oh and the navy ship actually had a big ceremony requested by Trump before it left for NY. So yeah.. fanfare.
Surpassing Expectations?  Who's expectations.  Not  's.  Trump said we would have a FULL Recovery by the end of Summer and be back even BIGGER than before by Fall.
As I recall, Fauci, CDC and WHO didn‚Äôt want a run on existing N95s which were in short supply globally. Also, I recall Fauci recommending a face covering and Trump said he would not be wearing one. On live TV.
will someone send me that child rape lawsuit against trump i am so pissed  my mother rn
If you don't feel compelled to vote at all this year, or if your morals compel you to write in a third party as a means of saving face, just stay home. Or better yet, just go ahead and cast your vote in for Trump. All of these choices might as well be the same fucking thing.
71% of people who voted for Trump do not have college degrees.
But you‚Äôre good with Biden saying ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt black if you vote for Trump‚Äù? What a hypocrite
Bless your heart you‚Äôre getting the candidates confused. Biden was the one who said ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt Black if you vote for Trump‚Äù
We are living in Idiocracy and Trump is President Camacho.
Pay close attention to what networks host the presidential debates.   We are going to see moderator interference like never before with Joe Biden at the podium against Trump.   Every time Joe stumbles or stutters they will jump in and finish his sentences.   #Debate2020 #Trump
Basically ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs a dumb old man? What do y‚Äôall want?!?‚Äù
Whichever prison Trump ends up in should have a 24 hour live stream from his cell that people can subscribe to who want to watch him suffer and all the proceeds should go to #BLM.
Samuel P. Huntington's pet transition countries--Hungary &amp; Poland--are revealing exactly why they were his favorite. Please don't forget how Huntington's Harvard tenure paved the ideological space for Trump and white nationalism.
So, racism doesn't exist. Trump has never done anything wrong, doesn't lie, hasn't committed fraud (despite losing fraud cases), isn't racist (despite saying &amp; doing racist things). Right. I'm the one who's full of shit. Right.
i dont think being transgender should influence hether or not ur allowed in the military. blaire tries to justify it saying trump probably banned them because dysphoria could get in the way, but honestly i think trump banned it out of pure transphobia.
Trump is not the dictator of America.
LOL. Still not a liberal. I never said every white is racist. But, pretending that racism doesn't exist is as much fantasy as pretending Trump has never done anything wrong &amp; its all fake news &amp; conspiracy against him. Donald Christ is here to save us but I'm too dumb to see it?
trump, it‚Äôs the banning tiktok for me
Quit living in a fantasy. Black doctors, lawyers, etc. aren't bc racism is gone from society. Your argument is that no president has done more for minorities. It's not true. The only person who would say it is would be Trump himself.
You seem to not be reading my responses. I don't support Biden. I don't like him. But, disliking Biden is not a reason to excuse the faults, etc. of Trump.
hello donald trump yes i live in america not a communist country please don‚Äôt take my tiktok away this is a free country
Did what things? Fed. Govt has a spending problem. That has been ignored by every president including Trump. That's why tax money is going to other countries - BC WE OWE TRILLIONS. It's all Dems? By my count, we've had 2 Dem POTUS &amp; 4 GOP POTUS in the last 40 years.
All pols are vile liars, ALL! But Trump is truly a special kind of vile &amp; stupid. It's hard to believe such an ignorant child could exist in a 74 year old body. But capitalism excels at creating vapid, ignorant, selfishish tools. #1
It takes courage and integrity to apologize. We all misspeak sometimes, whether it‚Äôs because we are actually wrong in a belief or we simply miscommunicate our message. Apologizing is something Trump is incapable of. He doubles down or just denies what he said.

Keilar debunks Trump campaign: You've got to shovel the BS  via
He's not getting the job done. Conservatives believe in limited gov't &amp; free trade. Trump? He promised to get rid of the deficit but deficit up more than 1/2 trillion by 2019. Trade wars, even w/ allies. Hasn't ended any real wars. Lies all the time. Hurts relationships w/ allies
You are inspiring. You had the courage to stand up for what is right, unlike your Governor who cowers to Trump. This is typical Republican supression of our democratic values that has become all too normal. You win the John Lewis ‚ÄúGood Trouble‚Äù award.
Time for young Americans to show trump who‚Äôs in charge.
Hey, remember at the beginning of the outbreak when Trump wanted to close the borders to infected countries but was then called racist?
I think there are other reasons they don‚Äôt allow family in the hospital other than the spread. I honestly think they just make elderly feel comfortable instead of helping them. They have to choose who gets ventilators ect.. had Trump not removed Obama‚Äôs policy on preparedness
Our government is busy trying to break Lebanon because the Lebanese government wanted to remove the Lebanese central bank governor Riad Salameh who is as crooked as trump.
It's the "what about the other guy" argument again. I'm not a Biden supporter either. But, disliking Biden or his policies is no reason to ignore the problems with Trump.
When Trump opens his mouth, you should know lies are going to come out of it. Who cares what he has to say on any issue? Whatever he says is a lie. Do you get it! Whatever Trump says is a LIE. A LIE , A LIE. If you believe him, you are dense, mentally disturbed, duped, or dumb.

So, you're just going to blindly support Trump regardless of anything he's done or said? All of the racist things he's said &amp; done don't bother you. How about fraud? Does that bother you? Lying good w/ you too?
Wild statement coming from a woman that supports Trump
This kind of thing isn‚Äôt even worth responding to. It‚Äôs taking Trump‚Äôs bait. I don‚Äôt think that even Trump‚Äôs evangelical base is so deluded that they would take this seriously. The priceless tweet so far is that Trump has been in Stormy Daniels more than he‚Äôs been in a church.

Maybe it makes me a bad person but I couldn't give two fucks about Kanye West and his supposed mental illness. He's a fool that is somehow a billionaire and is trying to doom this country by reelecting Trump.
Advisers to President Trump hesitated to give military options and warned adversaries over fears he might start a war - CNNPolitics
Walter Schaub rightly critiques politicization of Christian faith. One key change I hope to see in the rebuilding of conservatism in post-Trump years, is keeping Jesus out of politics, in coherence to 1st amendment. Separation of church and state.

It is indeed fucked up. Desperate effort by Trump to divert African-American votes. Trump thinks they're fools. üò∑
That‚Äôs WELL under the 2M Fauci predicted!!! So... you all say Trump did a terrible job! Your such hypocrites how about you demonize your demoncratic Governor‚Äôs for allowing older people to be placed in nursing homes where there are outbrewaks! Hold THEM responsible but NO
I've been trying to build a voice on here for a few years, but Twitter suppresses it. The harder the Dems push for Biden, the more and more certain I am that Trump must win in November.
NY Proves Trump‚Äôs Point: 20% of Mail-In-Votes Tossed, Leading To Democratic Win
Biden speaks inartfully about the Black community. Trump pounces. Media then blows it out. I posted about bad campaign coverage a couple days ago.
Yo  Trump refused to be interviewed by Mueller so I mean he kinda set this precedent.
Trump declares TikTok a ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù. Many parents of teens agree.   Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
Great  by voting for Kanye you are actually voting for trump. Congratulations! I guess you can't wait for four more years of #TrumpVirus
Yes !!! Thank you for covering our President Trump in prayers.
‚ÄúRubio, Hawley, Sasse and Cotton are inching toward a G.O.P. future. What are the odds they‚Äôll succeed? They‚Äôve got to be way under 50-50.‚Äú
‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100% uncomfortable with the direction Trump does. ‚Äú  Then proves it untrue by setting a silly qualification.
She or Harris would be great picks. Both are highly experienced and extremely bright. Both will be subject to vicious attack and, yes, everything having to do with Obama and Clinton will be relitigated by the R‚Äôs, particularly since Trump‚Äôs foreign policy has been so successful.
Got beachfront property in the Florida panhandle? Trump says he ‚Äòordered‚Äô no drilling off the Florida coast but there‚Äôs no evidence of any such order
Oh, I‚Äôm not denying that he clearly touches too much, but you can‚Äôt throw up his grandson and call him a stranger. It would be like me putting up the pic of Ivanka on Trumps lap and saying ‚ÄúLook at Trump w a teen girl he doesn‚Äôt know.‚Äù
Graham has been one of the biggest disappointments of the Republican Senate. He was once considered a voice that could moderate Trump‚Äôs behavior, but when McCain died, he showed his true colors. He has no dignity. He is no statesman. He is a political windsock.
No shot if Trump said this most people giving him the benefit of the doubt in these comments would feel the same way
Voter suppression. Political manipulation of the stock market. Slowing down the US Postal Service. Misrepresentation of pandemic data. This is just the beginning of the anti-democracy tactics Trump and the Republicans will be using to stay in power.
If they open their borders in Canada, and Trump wins. . . I'm gone!
Michael Berry ( Trump Campaign Holds Evangelical Rally At Vegas Casino To Get Around Rules
I like Trump‚Äôs policies, and I like that he was willing to give up his comfortable life to fight for conservative principles.

This should tell the nation everything about Trump, that those closest to him fear giving him choices and information. They recognize how dangerous he can be. Can you imagine a president so dangerous that his own advisors withhold information? This is the American President.
Still no facts or evidence that TicToc is a nat‚Äôl security problem presented to the public, just general concern. My guess is that this is more retribution by Trump. He wants TicToc muted before the election because they present a political problem for him, not the country.
These are the faces of evil. I hope they all go to jail,but I know they won‚Äôt. We could never get a conviction in the deep state area, but Trump will be hounded the rest of his life for trying to MAGA.  I am so glad I don‚Äôt live in Trump-hating states.
What is your point? Trump shows  up in companies that are manufacturing things Americans need to thank them and show us what is being done here in America. I don‚Äôt care that he doesn‚Äôt throw a pitch at a baseball game. Why do you?
President Trump should commute his sentence.
Joe just give it up,you can't do the job you can't run around like Trump,,your gaffes tells people the real Joe,plus you are being used be the Left,
What does Putin have on Trump? His deference to Putin is undisputed. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Hell yes, we got to get everyone to vote Trump,
Everyone feels this way. I'm afraid if it doesn't happen by the election, Trump will lose.
I'm curious, do Trump defenders, who have 2 contort themselves into ridiculous positions daily, ever feel embarrassed in the aftermath? Shamed? Is there any sense of self-loathing? Anger that  perversely persists in antics that put his supporters in ridicule?
President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat on security grounds.
Trump and the Republicans can attack no one. Their positions on Civil Rights, Voting Rights, diversity, and inclusion are widely known. They have problems with those issues.
trump did his best to also pretend tha Obama wasn‚Äôt an American either. Hopefully the only place trump would watch the Biden presidency is in a jail cell without his cellphone.
I for one does not want to hear the feelings of an idiot. Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump you numb skull.
Because I trust  I respect this choice. She has called Trump out at every chance she has gotten when he‚Äôs wrong which is all the time.
Well that works if you are proud to be associated with the party who refused to removed a traitor from office, cannot come up with Covid plan, lies to America every day, and has murdered citizens with depraved indifference. That REPUBLICAN PARTY? Trump and his buddies killed GOP!
Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
First India's potential band now supercell's involved Trump did a huge oopsie
Imagine the Clinton's being banned from having a Charity Foundation like Trump, who STOLE MONEY FROM KIDS WITH CANCER and have been banned to be trustees in a like trust.  The country us burning and you are bellyaching about this insignificant crap.
Republicans should be going after the Covid death crisis....160,000 dead Americans because Trump cannot come up with a freaking plan...thank god we are not in a war with him in charge.  You need to get your priorities straight.
She needs to grow a pair because the left is showing no mercy...Payback for Trump and GOP not removing his treasonous ass from office.  We don't pussyfoot around when our dander is up...Other GOP candidates....beware.  you have awakened your worst nightmare!
Separation of Church and state...practice your faith....you are NOT allowed to force your faith on others.  You want government out of your religion? Keep your religion the hell out of government.  BTW Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
So it is important to defend Trump's pronunciation of Thailand, but don't call him out on the Covid chaos or his murder of citizens with depraved indifference.  The Trump genocide of Americans.  Wow...good job Donnie on pronouncing Thailand correctly while killing US citizens.
Of course he‚Äôs no saint. Anyone who thinks they‚Äôre voting 4 a saint is stupid.u can‚Äôt distract me from Trump‚Äôs incompetence.
saying Michele Obama pronounces words wrong?  Please. Trump just this week. Thighland and Yo Semites? #trumpmispronounces
As a liberal, I'm perfectly comfortable with it. As a conservative, are you comfortable with the numerous Trump gaffes?
Kayne is an operative to help Trump cheat in order to win the election. Kanye‚Äôs sneaker company received Paycheck Potection Plan that was designed to assist small businesses keep employees. Yet Yeezy‚Äôs are made in Cambodia.
Will you Democrat‚Äôs prevent trump signing executive order to block evictions? Or will you praise him for  bypassing the GOP.... I‚Äôm going with preventing trump because you know.. politics
Headline is wrong.  It should read, ‚Äú15 Stupid and/or alcoholic adults drink hand sanitizer‚Äù.  No one just does that; and it‚Äôs always someone who knows better.  It‚Äôs not an epidemic and Trump didn‚Äôt cause it.
I see the campaign is trying to cover up the racist remark. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. This is why they won‚Äôt let joe debate trump.
True racism slips out from you every now and then, don‚Äôt it joe? What if trump said that? You would call for his removal from office
Seriously. Are liberals comfortable with this??   I get you hate trump. But watch this. It‚Äôs sad.

I'm voting to remove Trump from office. That's my main issue so I don't really care who he picks as VP.

I fully believe it is their aim to break this country on purpose just so they can blame it on Trump!

Heyyyy reminder that we gotta support the VP no matter who it is. Is Biden my first choice for president? Fuckin‚Äô nope. But that‚Äôs who we‚Äôve got. And we‚Äôve got to support and vote for him and his VP to get Trump out of the fucking White House.
If I had balls, I would stick it out until someone figured out that it was a reference to Trump fans criticizing JL for "getting too political." But I really can't handle that stress right now.
With GOP Hubby Andrea Mitchell with her focus on Clinton EMAILS Everyday(EVERYDAY) helping Elect Trump
looking forward to seeing you guys go down in November. Help the people! Back off from Trump!
there‚Äôs no way you will win. You don‚Äôt have a plan on how you‚Äôre going to lead this Nation. The Pandemic? Unemployment? You are making a joke out of the electional process and a fool of yourself. You are allowing Trump to use you. Or maybe that‚Äôs your plan. Sad. üòî

I can never imagine that with Trump.  Not even in a dream.
Shit bite Trump 100%

So sad that he is being used! I know he is not well but he put himself in a position to kiss up to Trump. Trump and those Republicans should be ashame of using a man who is not mentally stable.

When I hear there's some bullshit going down involving Trump and aluminum I can't help but to think about Deripaska, Rusal and that plant McConnell landed for his home state when he helped lift those sanctions to make Deripaska whole with Manafort.
I too am interested to hear more about this country of #Thighland Donald Trump spoke of.
While we making all these jokes about getting trump out of office lets make sure we go out and vote to ensure it ü•±

COLUMBUS, Ohio ( -- Ohio Gov. DeWine tests negative for COVID-19 after positive test earlier in the day, just before he was to meet Trump.

If you really are a Trump supporter, don't play the same game of dirty pool like the MSM and dems do. Be responsible! Here's my proof your tweet is bogus:
Money should never trump human health and human life.  I know the income the rally brings to Sturgis.  One must ask themselves, is this worth the risk now and the long term affects to those who get Covid and there are plenty.  Strokes, permanent lung damage, and heart problems.

The ‚ÄúTwo Corinthians‚Äù trope is tiresome.   In some Christians circles, particularly European ones, this is how the book is pronounced. Trump is not a righteous man but when this line of attack is used it proves some are as ignorant of Christianity as they portray him to be.
Bank Fraud? Tax Fraud?
OMG - what‚Äôs with the ‚Äúwhat most people know‚Äù sh*t?  Biden needs to promise to NEVER speak about African Americans again. EVER!!!!  If it weren‚Äôt for Trump this guy would never be elected.
Yet 38% looks at this and thinks, that is my guy. I want to follow him. Scary. Trump is insane and human garbage.   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
His actual history says different. Being sued by the Fed govt (twice) for discriminatory housing practices, removing black dealers from your casino, saying you dislike black accountants, Central Park 5, and many more examples point to the belief that Trump isn't racist as false.
It‚Äôs because anything Trump for even if it‚Äôs good they r against it!
That was a bad take tonight on  Comparing Trump‚Äôs calling BLM a symbol of hate is nothing like what Biden said. BLM funds go directly to Liberal PAC!
Did anyone know that Rudy Giuliani's first wife was actually his cousin. Giuliani seams 2 dog everybody else out but he looks like white trash &amp; now that he's gotten older he's just dumb white trash. And when all this sh*t is up &amp; Trump's out-of-office I smell bars for Giuliani.
Only in the warped state of Trump.
Well, it certainly ain't Trump, his circle of evil and his lying minions....they wouldn't know a truth if it slapped them in the fact.
Well, it may not have been said very eloquently, but I was trying to thank her for pointing out the increase, under Donald Trump!
Sorry, but there is no longer a Republican party. It's now the party of Trump, which is a cult! And, I know things would have been much different if you're father had lived. He's one of the last Republicans that I could truly depend on to do the right thing, in most cases.
YES! It‚Äôs that critical! I would brave Covid to make sure he‚Äôs voted OUT. tRump &amp; GOP are  huge threat to our democracy!
No matter what he pledges to, Trump will never pay up.
Laundered $ from the trump campaign hits different I guess
All of the crap we went through the last four years, how to beat Covid, fixing the economy and creating jobs and getting people back to work....and giving ever GOP repub hell for their part in this Trump Travesty.....the weather....
trump has many stories of how Jesus spoke for the rich and money changers. Jesus also said to cheat, lie and steal every penny from the poor.
Sorry young man. Everything your party touches turns to a disaster. Look, Trump is difficult and abrasive but his administration is doing a great job.
After trump, the bar for GOP presidential candidates will be so low I‚Äôm afraid that any sliver of decency will be rewarded with electoral success. I mean, this man would be a king if we‚Äôd allow him to be, &amp; yet he‚Äôs only marginally losing in polls.  It should be +30 for biden.
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, then Biden is even more powerful than God. Does trump understand the wrath of God?

Since money to trump is God, and Biden is one of the few politicians that hasn‚Äôt grown rich in office, I guess it‚Äôs all about what or who you think God is.
Can you believe Trump accuses Joe Biden of hurting the Bible &amp; hating God, Trump is a Nazi in the WH he's so deranged. Tear gas those folks in Washington so he could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible, if he keeps going to churches he's going to burn them down.
You can't blame Trump for a virus that no one new how to handle it,and knew nothing about it,
This is why Alabama can‚Äôt have nice things. It‚Äôs a sad fact about our state that both the Confederacy and football will trump just about anything else, including good governance.
People forget quickly that the jobs/careers that most African-Americans hold were won by President Johnson and the Democrats. The claims that Trump brought black Americans their lowest unemployment rate are misleading.
This is war!  Their goal all along!
He is in the WH and his name is trump. Where‚Äôs my $10M?
Right now never Trump means a path to socialism because that is the choice we have in Nov. I choose Trump‚Äôs policies.

Got to wait for Biden to get elected before a vaccine for Covid-19 comes into the picture as a party unity thing according to Joe Biden. Meanwhile Russia has announced they now have a satisfactory vaccine to begin using immediately which is a cure, but wait Democrats have nothing
If trump doesn‚Äôt win it will be because he lost rather than Biden winning. Trump‚Äôs worst enemy is himself.

I take back my prediction about Biden winning now.
She has been a VP contender since she  endorsed Biden. Harris is the first Black woman and Asian American person on a major-party presidential ticket.
The Democratic ticket for president is set. Trump-Pence vs. Biden-Harris.

#BREAKING Joe Biden chooses Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
I like what I just heard re: the Biden VP choice.
So they have pushed Biden to pick a VP, if Biden dies and he were elected that VP pick would become President and Pelosi might have competition in a fight to manage Congress if VP is a female. What if, then may happen that she cannot accept the nomination in which case a upset.

While you wait for the announcement of Biden's running mate, you should check out the vice-presidential biographies on the U.S. Senate's web page. They're very deep and often surprisingly dark, like Sinclair Lewis was commissioned to write them.
Twitter might break when Biden announces
Kasich does whatever benefits Kasich. He is looking for a cabinet position with Biden. It is pretty slutty, but that is what politicians are.
I really thought the Dems could do better than Biden. The outlook for this nation is now bleaker than ever thanks to the complacency of the #DNC and the #GOP. No faith in this two-party system at all.
Or is she, as the VP candidate, the last to speak before the Biden family and then Joe himself?

I just lost respect for Bernie. It's not ok to point out our country in peril if Biden wins and then say you won't vote. Will a Biden (Dem) presidency be better for the common good or a Trump (Repub) presidency? Bernie knows the answer. Shame on him for not voting.

Does anyone REALLY care who Jill, sorry, Joe Biden picks for his VP?
Sometimes people have to awaken in the gutter before they can think about sobriety. Today Democrats have no pipeline of leaders. They are old and out of ideas. They scraped the barrel and selected Joe Biden. He has been a professional politician for almost 50 years. Ideas? Not.
His goofy, awkward looking, nasal sounding son  said the bike ride was staged. He‚Äôs an idiot. EVEN IF IT WAS, Biden STILL had to get on the damn thing and ride it! Junior probably never learned to ride a bike either.
Seriously, can on January 21, 2021 could ‚ÄúPresident Biden,‚Äù declare a national shower day? It would be appropriate to cleanse the all the sleaze and corruption out the White House
So Pelosi's illegals cannot obtain stardom because of the Biden African-American Diversity Education sessions Joe is offering the murdered Christians in three countries in Africa.

You‚Äôre a brave, honorable soul!  I live in an apartment, so I don‚Äôt have a yard to put a sign in.  I‚Äôve had 3 Biden stickers on my car, all torn off, and noticed a few new dents in my car doors.  I wear my Biden mask everywhere I go, and get petty remarks, Alabama, go figure.
Why? Because Shaun is misleading you? Biden hasn‚Äôt picked a running mate
i can't find any record of biden ever approving any kind of funding for health justice, where are you getting the idea that he has ever "supported" any kind of abortion or health care?
trump's paid for more abortions out of pocket than biden has approved government funding for.    there's lots of reasons to support biden if that's your thing, but he has zero record of supporting health justice generally, and especially not abortion rights.
you realize biden was in a church when he made those "shoot them in the legs" comments, right?
That‚Äôs what everyone said in 2016. Can‚Äôt take this election for granted.  Many people dislike Trump and are disappointed by Biden being in the Democratic ticket. They may stay home.
Thank you  for speaking up!   Alabama Democrats are moms and dads; pastors and laypeople; educators, nurses, and welders. We‚Äôre neighbors who love our neighbors‚Äîfrom the Eastern Shore to Sevenmile Island.

Russia &amp; Ukraine sinking Joe Biden &amp; his son slowly, Ukraine court case filed against Biden in Ukraine. That money Joe &amp; Son took was a Ukraine fund with Russia, Biden is literally guilty.
Joe Biden has no defense for his irresponsible actions, known fully his son had absolutely no expertise in anything the Ukrainian Gas Co had supposedly paid him for, their President fled Ukraine &amp; Biden and his son came back to America with the Ukraine fund. That's it folks.
Soon once Russia and the Ukrainian's got back in-line with the monetary fund of Ukraine Biden took to America Ukraine brought charges against Joe Biden in Ukraine Court.
Biden denigrated himself in Ukraine esp to the Russian financial goals and responsibilities, money owed to Russia somehow was given away to Biden's son and his father Joe came and withdrew his son &amp; money back to America strong arming the Ukrainian Co deal with Russia.
Oh power, perhaps  has more diverse sincerity for the hundred's of dead murdered Christians of African countries than Biden has for the dead Latino's that did not make it crossing the US/Mexican border. Is Biden OK with Hedge Funding, BLM, riots, murders?
Sure Joe Biden worries that Trump will notice hundreds of Christian African-American's were murdered in three countries in Africa following Biden mentioning a learning session he offers African-American's on Diversity which would be a frightening event to the public not aware.

You cannot teach dead people anything especially Diversity Joe Biden, I say You started it with religion aiming to show African-American's being taught in African countries yet when they ended up all dead you fell through the floor like a elephant in the room.
Why is there a JOE BIDEN, NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER? Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden!!!! Now Schumer is flipping the ideology against Trump as starting it on religion.
Did you hear the latest #FakeNews off MSNBC,, Biden wants to teach African-American's Diversity, however, those African-American's who lived in 3 countries in Africa are dead &amp; cannot learn Diversity, Hundreds of Christians Murdered by Islamic Jihadists Across 3 African Countries
Are African-American's now deceased in three African countries  You proud of yourself Biden? Hundreds of Christians Murdered by Islamic Jihadists Across 3 African Countries

Ill wait until I read the platform but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm voting for anything when I will for democrats in 2020. I have 0 Enthusiasm about a Biden Harris ticket. If anyone else where in the White House I‚Äôd vote 3rd party and probably will in 2024 if Biden wins.
Can we please have the masked-up rallies for Biden-Harris now? üëèüèΩ We can do this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let‚Äôs get to work.
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.

DNC is loyal only to big donors including dark money. I don‚Äôt think Biden has a say - it is the DNC donors making the decision. And if Yang is for removing money out of politics - then not a good fit with the status-quo. My opinion only.
"Trail" not "Trial"- although Biden needs to pass trial &amp; go straight to judgement!
How many years has Biden been in politics?  What has he done in all that time to make a difference? He appears to have dementia

I think you‚Äôll see a run up about a month before the election like IBB tanked into 2016 election. The presidential election is less relevant than how the 11+ states vote on legalization. Gut says all of them will vote to legalize it. If Biden wins no sector will be spared

Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don‚Äôt want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Since Russia is so busy trying to discredit Biden, any truly patriotic American should obviously vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is  a poke in the eye for Putin

Sadly, this seems to be Biden's platform.  Do we actually want Biden to demonstrate how much better he plans to be?  Does he intend to suck just a little less?  Judging from his past, that is the plan.  Biden sucks a little less.
Well, I'm finally convinced.  Trump sucks.  I just wish I had known that--wait, I've known that for five years now.  Aren't you just a "little" tired of this being the only campaign?  Each time Biden/Kamala says something bad about Trump a chance to cite a positive idea dies.

Democrats lauded Harris as a perfect complement to Biden‚Äôs centrist candidacy, but some Republicans argued the move only reinforces their allegations Biden has become a tool of the far left.
I don‚Äôt get it. The Trumplicans are arguing that Biden picked Harris because she‚Äôs black. Then they say she‚Äôs not actually black. How does this even make sense?
Easy... backing the blue does not mean the same as mass incarceration. Imagine a country with  no police. We need the police... we don‚Äôt need the legislation that disproportionately effects the black community which is what Biden and Harris have done.

First  From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of¬†SOCIALISM¬†and¬†DECLINE.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it‚Äôs no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is¬†weak on crime and refuses to put America
Ôøº¬† Friend,  It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the¬†48th Vice President of the United States.  I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
For anyone who care what they have to say, I got an email in my BS account from the TRUMP campaign and I hope you all don't vote for Biden for the love of your life, your family, your country and your freedom of expression and civil rights.

Hell, criticize them to your hearts content. Kamala has been calling for defunding the police recently though, and picking her was a better move than picking Klobuchar (marginally). But also no one could make Biden look other than he is at this point. He's still not Trump.

It's all for votes!  Biden chose her because he got an ultimatum saying he must choose a black woman.  She's suddenly Black American for same reason. BLM will still demand destruction of America!
Last time I checked Biden‚Äôs never actually been the President during any of those 50 years, whereas Trump‚Äôs been POTUS for the last 4 years and yet he still talks about what he will do and not what he has done because all he‚Äôs done is damn near DESTROY THE COUNTRY! üôÑüôÑüôÑ #ETTD

Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
"JOE BIDEN IS RACIST SO IMMA BE HIS RUNNING MATE" -Kamala
You‚Äôre exactly right I drive about 1500 miles a week all over the southeast. Never see a Biden sign I‚Äôve seen one bumper sticker,one out of thousands of cars
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Girl what? Do you realize all the sus shit Biden has said when it pertained to integration and segregation. Harris literally called him out on supporting policies of segregationist but it‚Äôs whatever
I DON‚ÄôT mean that you should vote Biden/Harris and then go ignore politics for the next 4 years. No. If you don‚Äôt like the Dem slate, get involved at the lower level. Vote local, vote city, vote county, vote state, vote school board (even if you don‚Äôt have kids), vote dogcatcher.
Look folks, my reaction to the Biden/Harris ticket can best be summed up as ‚Äòmixed, complex, and nuanced‚Äô, but I am still voting for them against Trump. This is not a ‚Äòtake your ball and go home‚Äô moment given how our system actually, y‚Äôknow, WORKS.
No. But I'm not voting for Biden either.
So far the race for a Biden VP is a ‚ÄúRun for the Roses‚Äù.
Im thinking about voting for the first time. I never voted because i dont want to do jury duty lol. Can you give me some reasons to vote for Biden over Trump? Thank you!
Too bad after like a month Biden will be declared not fit for office and then peoples votes for him would be for nothing. She‚Äôll destroy our economy with the things she proposes.
You think wrongly, my friend.
as if biden wasn‚Äôt bad enough he picks kamala as his vip ?!!
Dearest Joseph Robinette Biden ( ),  Thank you.  We. Are. Ready.  Signed,  The #KHiveForBiden   #BidenHarris2020
And everyday calling for Obama‚Äôs birth certificate was, even after he provided it?? This is more proof we have the wrong person in the Oval Office. Don‚Äôt know if Biden is either, but compared to this, I am all for it!
Difference is Biden knew he had mispronounced it, Trump mispronounced it twice &amp; didn‚Äôt know he did anything. We are better off without him. I will always feel that way. Watch the Axios interview, no defending it.
In the midst of a defund the police movement Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP choice.
So, who‚Äôs trying to listen to me rant about the Biden-Harris ticket, black voters, the DNC speaker list, and more.üò≠ I got the time today.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
That would make too much since for black people. Remember this is a dog and pony show.  His selection was premeditated. She is a token black.  She has a track record that spells trouble for our community  No matter who wins, Trump/Biden. The same thing will happen FOR "Black" ppl
Did Sleepy Joe forget that only months ago Kamala Harris attacked him for his racist policies? Now he is handing over the reins of the Presidency to her and the radical left. #al01 #alpolitics
Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate. Whoop! Whoop!
Don‚Äôt really want to vote for Trump or Biden smh
He was having a real hard time running against Biden  He will now focus his attention on the black woman running as VP.
has spent entire career in upholding the rule of law, which  has spent his entire life trying to avoid.  -
biden will now attempt a law and order campaign
And just like that....Kamala loves Joe Biden. ü§£ü§£ü§£

I‚Äôll gladly vote Biden/Harris, but yeah, not exactly my first choice.
Kamala Harris? Biden? Democrats have duped the "Black" community again.  Do y'all realize how many of our people have been tossed in jail (with the key thrown away) because of the actions and inactions of these two?  Wow #DoingTheSameThingAndExpectingDiffefentResultsIsINSANITY
Biden just announced Kamala Harris as his VP pick! Woohoo!!!
So, Joe Biden is going with Kamala Harris as his VP. I think that she's more risky than some of the other candidates but she's definitely qualified and I have no issue with voting for that ticket.  And neither should any of you.
So Biden picked Kamala Harris for his running mate.

Biden needs foreign policy help because he is always wrong on foreign policy:   Plus, he's a "demagogue."
Ronald Reagan warned us against Joe Biden&lt;br&gt;
In other words, Biden‚Äôs handlers have chosen and informed him who‚Äôs name will be announced today.
Joe Biden has selected his running mate, revealing to top advisers the woman he will invite to join his ticket, two people familiar with the matter say
Advisors tell Joe Biden who they have chosen to be his running mate**
He is as much of a conservative as Biden is of sound mind.
What cognitive issues? Biden has been a gaffe machine his whole career, and there are multiple montages showing Trump and Biden both equally stumbling words and confusing events (eg, just yesterday Trump says 1917 pandemic ended WWII).
Whoever Biden selects as his VP running mate, she will be 1,000% better than our current VP! And I dearly hope that she will speak "truth to power" with the President rather than soulless wimp that currently holds the office!
so when Biden sold our country to China that made him a great vp?
Any debate between Presidential candidates would be a farce because Biden would have the questions given to him before hand as well as his prepared answers.
If it IS #KamalaHarris that Biden‚Äôs handlers choose, which one will it be?ü§î
Exactly. The Trump platform is all about fear &amp; hate-fear of Biden &amp; hatred of other Americans. With no principles/policy to go by, Trump must have conflict to survive -the last 4 yrs prove this. If today‚Äôs America is your happy place, vote Trump. For the rest of us it‚Äôs Biden.
A Biden/Rice ticket pretty much lets  go on to victory by doing not much more than letting the Trump campaign punch itself out. Don't underestimate how many people are *really* pissed at Trump and plan to vote Biden no matter what anyway, so half of this is theater. 2/2
You know why I say Susan Rice is a safe choice? Because, when all the right has on her is Muh Obamagate, there's not much damage that can be dealt to her. Nothing they've thrown at Biden is sticking either, and the Trump campaign is going to be all offense out of necessity. 1/2
Alabama Sen. Doug Jones will be among the speakers at the Democratic National Convention next week, a virtual event at which the party will formally nominate Joe Biden as its presidential candidate.
So it' obvious that if Biden doesn't pick a black woman for his VP then the Blk community will turn to Trump to spite Biden? Just guessing that the BLM would evaporate as they would no longer have the support from all Americans nor a donor base to support them! Blacks for Trump?
With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here‚Äôs how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist trope‚Ä¶
Good statement from Bernie but it begs the question: Why have your Bernie Bros taken it upon themselves to disparage every female candidate for Biden's VP? Why have they enlisted Russian bots in their plans? Why are they trashing your stated goals to suit their own agenda? Why?
Reminder to Democrats: VP Pence is not a democrat! Quit trying to get Biden to select another Pence or Trump will win in 2020 by such vocal shortsightedness!
...very much like what is going on now with Biden. Trump listened, and his choice was made by himself, Jared and Ivanka. We now have Pence as VP. The question is do we want Joe to listen to the loudest voices, or do we want him to select a VP that will work hard for us,or a joke?
B.S.    Biden doesn‚Äôt know anything except what he‚Äôs told 2 say! Get real‚ÄºÔ∏è
Man, if Biden picks Susan Rice as his VP; it will be 2016 all over again. I got tired of heating about Benghazi.
Have you idiots heard Joe Biden talk about little kids rubbing his hairy legs in a swimming pool are maybe the one where he‚Äôs riding a cockroach?
Biden is heeding Napoleon‚Äôs advice: ‚ÄòNever murder a man who is committing suicide.‚Äô‚Äù
I encourage Mr. Biden to be as outrageously stupid as his l'il heart desires. After all, he's VERY competent, they tell us.
That could change though, I doubt Biden‚Äôs made up his mind
Then Biden said.... Who's Harry Truman..?
Biden subscribes to the theory that a huge LIE told often will be believed by the masses who don't pay attention. Trump NEVER said he would defund Social Security!
I am voting on November 3 for Joe Biden, I don't care who he picks as VP. The situation is critical.
This is the same man who can‚Äôt quote any scripture that important to him because he doesn‚Äôt read the Bible. If he revered God he wouldn‚Äôt have autographed Bibles. If he was just a little religious he wouldn‚Äôt be judging Biden‚Äôs faith or saying he hates God He‚Äôs a piece of work
49% and to date no debate !! If he can‚Äôt debate he certainly doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to run a county. Of course China supports him... they will own the USA if Biden wins! God help us all.
To play rope-a-dope, at some point you need to be able to land a killer punch. Biden can't.
Folks.... Don't worry, Biden will not be running the Country... His VP and Cabinet will.
Wow.  Pelosi says "China Would Prefer Joe Biden". #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica

Yeah you must not listen to Biden speak much. Every time he speaks to a black journalist or commentator, he makes racist comments. His latest where he said ‚Äúcome on man, did you have to get checked to see if you have cocaine in your system?‚Äù (Paraphrased). He is truly racist!
Opinion Communist China is actively helping Joe Biden and Amazon Compost is a active part of the communist China propaganda.
I keep hearing all this talk from Biden advocates about taking away our 2nd Amendment rights.  If you don't have a clue about what's being said, if you have loved ones to protect, keep your guns!  If good people don't have guns, bad people will !!
I don‚Äôt care if someone looks like Gandhi next to Trump, I can‚Äôt about what needs to be done, and Biden doesn‚Äôt go far enough.
No, it‚Äôs not Biden is a moderate. His policies and how he believes they can be achieved are moderate.

About as big as Biden's crowds.
Had a wild thought  Since we know Halloween is pretty much canceled,  why don't we all show up in Super Hero costumes when we vote on November 3rd. With everything going on in this country,  I know I'll feel like a Hero when I vote Biden as our next president
Why isn‚Äôt Biden in jail for graft and greed and using his office as VP to line his pockets and lean on other countries like a mafioso Godfather! He makes he sick to my stomack and Harris is a puke ü§Æ of a woman

Actually?  I think about this shit every time I see somebody say "so Biden went with the cop, huh?".    We've been nipple deep in con men for the past four years; it hurts me to the bottom of my heart to say it, but I think we could use a cop with an axe to grind right about now.
I have a better idea since you‚Äôre so thirsty for Biden , why not just let him be President now ? Trump is obviously not doing it for you . üëçüèΩ
BIRTHERISM = RACISM. I WANT A PRESIDENT WITH POSITIVE QUALITIES. TRUMP TRADES ON THE EVIL IN HUMANITY. I WILL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS!

Hopefully President Biden fires this guy as his first official act. Many people depend on the post office for meds. This can be a life or death situation.
First, stop whining and acting defeated. Why would you think the full weight of the american people will fail to stop this sabotage of the post office? Did trump succeed in getting Ukraine to harm biden? Did he get caught and made to stop caging kids?

The only thing the Obama-Biden Admin did was drive a bigger wedge between Israel and UAE
THIS.  And it‚Äôs a crime and political malpractice that, until Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign came along in 2019, the only person effectively prosecuting the case against this sort of elitism was a Vermonter socialist.
Joe Biden wrapped up the nomination way faster in ‚Äò20 than Barack Obama did in ‚Äò16.  Biden has united 97% of the party this early, in a way Hillary Clinton never did or could.  Excuse me while I laugh at aides to either pretending Biden‚Äôs not good enough.
Please do not focus on bad things about Biden or Harris (I am fully aware thank you). I want to hear why you support Trump. Make him the priority of your post.
Ok all you Trump supporters I have a challenge for you. I doubt you will respond. I challenge you to only post factual items about Trump. Convince me. If posts are about Biden or Harris, they must be direct quotes or facts that can be proven. Nothing salacious.
Did you see the excerpt from Biden‚Äôs rant against a reporter saying he graduated w 3 degrees, top of his law school class, had a superior IQ. Then they show all the networks doing fact cks. All total Bullshit. Delusion but delivered w such vehemence. He believes his own lies.

Mark Levin: Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris brings 'nastiness' to the table
This man won‚Äôt make promises he doesn‚Äôt intend to keep. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together will restore our country to the magnitude and greatness we remember.
Above all, in my opinion Joe Biden is a good man. He is a Christian. He practices his faith. He has experience and is respected among world leaders. He has integrity. He has known loss and he has love in his heart. He is strong and knows healing. He is a survivor.
That‚Äôs what we need. Biden is not afraid of a challenge. I like that about him. He doesn‚Äôt mind someone who disagrees with him. He knows when to listen to someone who knows better than him on a particular subject. He respects truth and honesty.
That‚Äôs what grownups are supposed to do. It‚Äôs the president of the United States job to compartmentalize. Joe Biden can do this. Trump can not. Kamala Harris will compliment Joe Biden. She will advise him; not always agree with him. His cabinet will probably be diverse.
He seeks to heal our wounded nation by combining the elite minds from the top of their fields, whether they agree with him or not. As long as the United States of America improves from their knowledge, Joe Biden is willing to listen and act in our best interests.
Vice President Joe Biden is a Democrat. He is not a dictator, an authoritarian, or a neofascist. He would never undermine an election. If he felt an election were in jeopardy, he would allocate funds to ensure a fair and just process.
She is a trash candidate. She wants to ban assault rifles via executive action. She wants to ban plastic straws for some reason. She want socialized Medicare. And she‚Äôs against fracking. Why the hell did Biden choose this woman? He already had California and the black vote.
Fuck Joe Biden
Here ya go for all those that want Biden in 2020. You telling me you agree with his statements? Now all the sudden he‚Äôs changing his mind cause he cares about you? Nope, he wants votes!!! PERIOD!!!
The most troubling &amp; dangerous thing about Trump than is abuse of power,mental health,narcissism,&amp; pettiness is his own goddamn ego! Regardless of what people think of Biden,We need someone better that Trump. 4 more years of Trump and everyone's not gonna stand for it!

Kamala Harris represents 'complete socialist takeover of Joe Biden,' Trump 2020 adviser Schlapp says  #FoxNews
Is the idea here that the Biden campaign is weak and slow because it‚Äôs currently beating the Trump folks by a historically large margin for modern elections?
It‚Äôs really, really popular in media and Very Online circles to dismiss ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù as a gigantic, lost cause Trump voting bloc.  Thank God the Biden team hasn‚Äôt bought into it.
And I think the biggest reason why is that the Biden campaign ( et al) has made sure these important constituencies aren‚Äôt only being spoken to by the GOP.   makes this point a lot, and it‚Äôs important: we should never surrender to Trump in this space.
Most of these folks never liked Trump to begin with, but none of them even considered voting for Democrats in ‚Äò16. In fact, they took active steps to avoid doing so.  For a few reasons, their calculus has changed drastically in ‚Äò20, and most are now affirmative Biden voters.
The Biden campaign has brought these groups closer together than ever before, at least from my vantage point.  Dozens of ‚Äúevangelical Christians‚Äù I know and love have given up on Trump. The cages, the gassing of protesters, the racism ‚Äî it was all too much.
Boy we saw it first hand. What a horrible President that idiot was &amp; to show how many stupid people are in this Country they elected him twice &amp; that's exactly why I know Biden will win. He doesn't know who he is, but he'll win.
Can you dispose of Biden ? He‚Äôs garbage
Trump supporters: we can't live in fear from something like a virus because we'll die anyway  Same people: *swallows 10 pills and uses essential oils like it's weed* You know, Biden is going to take away all the guns and supports ANTIFA
It helps that the media was dedicated to praising everything Obama/Biden did. Hell, it didn‚Äôt matter if was Fast and Furious, Benghazi, spying on U.S. citizens; the media bowed at their feet. Now the media be as hellüòÇ

This Trump rally in the White House being the chaser to the Biden/Harris shot we got earlier sucks.    It's like drinking milk after the shot of tequilla.  Gross.
Joe Biden has a relatively unique ability among national political figures to make fun of Trump for his whining, and we should be looking for more of it as summer turns to fall.
Joe Biden just said Trump has done nothing but sign executive orders. Hmmm. You talking about that executive order to extend unemployment benefits that your party wouldn‚Äôt pass bc they wanted to play politics?  Please, playaüôÑ
Biden didn't talk in a stream of consciousness garbled mess and Senator Kamala Harris just gave the speech of her career.  It really contrasts with the "me me me" Trump keeps displaying.
I really don‚Äôt understand why people are doing this. Like yes she might be terrible. But Pence/Trump is worse. No Biden isn‚Äôt who we really want. But we definitely don‚Äôt want Trump again. It‚Äôs not like we have a lot of options.
The Biden-Harris Administration. That's the tweet.
Did Joe Biden just call her Komdalisa at his press conference?
WE certainly WILL.  Voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
Harris will make a great addition to the Biden team.  Just ask Your HUSBAND.
The question at this point is who do you think will do less damage as POTUS? Trump or Biden?
That's California Joel. Her record as the AG is very suspect esp with incarcerating blacks. The Dems already have California for 2020. The front of the ticket remains Joe Biden, whom Kamala accused of being a racist. Lot more problems on the Dems ticket.
You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be mad that I ran over my damn Wayfarers I‚Äôve had for 5 years but it gave me an opportunity to order some Biden shades

Biden is basically where a third term Ronald Reagan would have been if not worse in his progression, no way they put him on the stage without a script.

These are the asshole who will also say "that was Obama, Biden had nothing to do about it" when we point at economic growth, etc.
Why this conversation period.  Not once has anyone questioned the ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of Joe Biden or the ‚Äúorangeness‚Äù of trump.  Please talk about the issues:  Covid-19, healthcare.
Joe Biden was refused communion. He is in complete rebellion. Without acknowledging, confessing and repenting he will remain in rebellion. So at best, he is a luke-warm, rebellious Catholic by name only. You know what the Bible says about being ‚Äòluke-warm‚Äô: Rev 3:16 üî•
Kamala was already announced as the first Indian woman to compete in major election? ü§î Her  family was major slave owners in ‚ÄòBrown Town‚Äôüò°. She called Biden a racist, segregationist and believed his sexual harassment accuser üòÆ. Make up yalls mind ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
Dismembering and sacrificing human beings will never be ok. Joe Biden must repent and the Catholic Church must take a stand. God will not be mocked.
To say Joe Biden is Catholic is to say that God and the Church have changed their mind about abortion. That hasn‚Äôt happened.
Except Biden‚Äôs support of abortion.
Along with my rant from previous tweets, America is seeing the largest wage gap between the top 1% and working class since the French revolution.... Neither Trump or Biden will do anything substantial to fix that. IDC if these CEO billionaires ‚Äúworked hard to get where they are‚Äù
We need more people of the working class in office. We need more people of the millennial generation in office. Stop voting legacy politicians into office. They have never cared about anyone but themselves, their pockets, and their big corporations. Biden ain‚Äôt anything special
Y'all. Donald Trump has a racism, narcissism, sexism, and tax fraud problem. His fan base has a racism problem. Stop falling for his bullshit. Biden absolutely needs to right a lot of wrongs, but thinking Captain Cheetoh is better? Embarrassing.
She believes Biden‚Äôs accuser but accepts his VP nomination: such sincerityüòè
I think Trump has been triggered because an amazing Black Woman named Kamala Harris was Biden's VP pick. So instead of being triggered of the 160,00 people that died under his and the accomplices negligence,They going nuts over Biden's VP pick! Everyone already knows time it is!
‚ÄúShe is also the first Democratic presidential or vice-presidential nominee from west of Texas‚Äù
I was a big Juli√°n Castro Supporter. Was hoping to see his name in the mix, but this is an extremely electable ticket. Biden knee what he was doing.
the media just don't get it the person you force on us NEVER WIN!! Kamala Harris isn't going to bring the Black Voters out unless she changes some political views! We're not impressed with Good looks Anymore sorry Biden ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
What pisses me off is the economy under Trump made life good for Biden, Harris and most of the wealthy Dems. Not to mention more work for those so inclined. Unemployed got a raise. And they still wanna tear this house down. Lunacy! Pure Lunacy
I love this so much! Taking back our country‚Äôs soul! Biden/Harris 2020
i AM voting for biden however i will continue to complain abt him &amp; the other one girl!!! i complain every day of my damn life why would this be any different.....
- Biden was Vice President when a man was executed by a firing squad in 2010.   - Biden Was the Senator of Delaware when a Delaware man was executed by hanging in 1996.

Normally everyone. But we're talking about Joe Biden.
So you CAN sleep your way up the ladder. Sara Palin earned her stripes the normal way. Yeah I know this is controversial but I heard her trash Biden till she dropped out. Wonder if HE did. Apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter to him.
Somehow I knew Joe Biden was gonna pick Kamala Harris as VP and Trump reacted by calling her "Nasty" &amp; "Phony Kamala" but it also seems he didn't like the VP choice too! Trump fears strong women,No matter what tricks he pulls everyone already can see through him like a laserbeam!
Daryl, if you are voting for Biden then we are the same ‚Äúus.‚Äù
Something that I‚Äôve learned in the past 4 yrs is that the candidate or even the platform isn‚Äôt the end game of politics. The candidate is the beginning and then you work to ensure that they support the policies you want. That being said, I am ready to vote Biden/Harris on Nov 3rd

I can only speak for myself, but I don‚Äôt like that she‚Äôs been known to turn her back on the black community, her own community, as soon as it proves to be convenient. I‚Äôll still be voting for her and Biden but that‚Äôs just one thing that rubs me the wrong way.

Biden and Harris will be a great team to have in the White House. Time to get good decent smart people back in charge.  Can't wait to vote on November 3rd.
talking about candidates on this website (tm) is a bad time, but I appreciated Kamala absolutely dicing Biden during the debates &amp; him having the wherewithal to be like "yeah, I need her on my team"
President Obama notes, thusly, ‚ÄúJoe Biden nailed this decision.‚Äù
2/2 choice if Biden wanted to focus on domestic policy and sure up a progressive base. With all of that said, Kamala Harris will be a better Vice President than US AG. I believe Rice for Sec. of State and I hope we find the political will to win the senate and make Warren leader
The Obama folks from ‚Äò08 get all the fame, a podcast, tee shirts and the like. And much of that is deserved. But this Biden team, many of them old hands in Washington, has bested even the Pod Bros.
Let me be clear, I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for VP because of her ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù tenure as an AG in California. I thought Susan Rice was a much better choice if Biden felt like rebuilding international relations and obligations. I thought Warren was the better 1/
‚ÄúAnd that little girl was me‚Äù!

Kamala Harris is just Joe Biden in a lightskin black woman swatch. Take that how you will. But that‚Äôs my feelings on this situation.
Lmaooo Biden was racist a couple months ago according to Kamala Harris. Now that she‚Äôd become president if he‚Äôs elected he‚Äôs not bad
Biden/Harris sounds more appealing than the Trump/Pence "the country we lead now is a disaster...elect us again to fix it"
And if Biden‚Äôs smart, he‚Äôs gonna go into every Southern state and loudly and openly blame Trump for it happening.
Stop worrying about football and solve the virus and the American economy depression.  This Is Your Dam Job.  Biden will have to do it when he becomes president.
It is NOT about the networks. It is about Trump claiming victory in every state he leads on election night and saying its Fraud when Biden wins due to mail ins. Dems need to make sure mail ins will be counted by election night or emphasize IN PERSON EARLY VOTING
I guess from his politics, Biden believes the world better by killing the unborn...up to the day of delivery. Scripture is clear, God is the author of life. Woe be to those who oppose the Creator of life!
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. just sent me an email entitled ‚Äúre: our historic announcement‚Äù and it‚Äôs not even about his VP selection‚ÅâÔ∏è Sir.
Something we don‚Äôt think about often enough is just how awful the 2016 Clinton campaign was at appearances and visuals, as demonstrated in this graf from today‚Äôs Times convention write-up.  Biden is running 6-7 points ahead of Hillary due, in large part, to this fact.

Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.

Here is something from three months ago. But I hadn‚Äôt seen anything about this until that Biden tweet tbh
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn‚Äôt trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can‚Äôt fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We‚Äôve got to find better people to run.
Yeah, China wants Biden to win so he can dominate the US again.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
2/2 one law that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended up disproportionately punishing African Americans. Biden‚Äôs 1994 omnibus anti-crime law is blamed for accelerating incarceration rates, especially of black men.
1/1 I hear you. I think they‚Äôre 2 diff heads of same snake. Biden just gets a pass and he has written laws that have absolutely devastated black families.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you‚Äôre a Biden supporter ?
Also that Biden doesn't even know it's been released, let alone had anything to do with writing, you know, the, the thing.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
One consolation of a (hypothetical) Biden presidency will be the press having to play janitor for whatever Joe vomits out.  Nothing they can take inspiration from like with Obama, just endless "what he really said/meant was..."  They're going to be so depressed by 2024.
In order to support and vote for Biden, a documented racist at his core, they end up condoning and propagating racism with that support! - Stephen Fuller
Biden‚Äôs racism has ALWAYS been there. It‚Äôs apart of his core as a man. Yet, the Democrats continue to give him a pass! By doing so, the Democrats simply are not credible , their arguments are not valid, and they lack any standing in any serious discussion about racism.
If Biden is incapable of debating or knows he is incapable and afraid, how about at least have 3 rads (Dems) vs 3 conservatives ( Republicans) on stage for 2 hours and debate 5 major issues predetermined by national polls. 1/2POTUS made his press briefing in Washington on time, if you only paid attention to them. Here is your Communist trying to babble from his hideout. Thinks he's in his sister's basement. Biden doesn't know his sister from his wife. Commies will pull him, watch.
In a world that sees Biden become President, I‚Äôd much rather  be a perpetual &amp; belligerent thorn prodding Biden in the side from the left in the Senate.
One of the best moves Trump could do to rattle Biden is pardon Snowden and invite him to a debate. üòÇüòÇ
OK so what if biden made a deal with trump to just get in office and ruin every possible thing he could so that he could run against him in the 2020 election and people would settle for him because we NEED to get trump outta office and it‚Äôs all a big conspiracy
and when Joe Biden actually took action on Corona virus, he took the wrong action. He encouraged people to vote in person, if they were feeling healthy. This went against CDC guidelines.

Also based on what I have read recently, the President can only really issue a pardon for federal charges. So a state AG could go after him on charges at the state level (like in NY). No reason for Biden not to pardon, as I see it. Sets a bad precedent.

My point it that we have to focus on getting them in. We can do that AND address their shortcomings, but getting them in is priority 1. Obama wasn‚Äôt progressive but we made progress on which, with Biden, we can build on. Was it everything, no. But it was a good step.
Biden should debate when Trump produces his Tax returns

I think we get him elected and then push. His policy/action is superior to Trump‚Äôs in every way, so I think the focus right now needs to get Biden elected. Then I think we can press hard for progress. Not ideal, but the alternative is Trump.
Oh I have no issues with criticizing the left people. None at all. I just think that we also need to, despite those criticisms, encourage people to vote for him. Biden wasn‚Äôt my choice at all. Neither was Harris. But this ticket can win and we need to support it.

I will not be voting for Biden (nor Trump) in this presidential election. The DNC has let us know for the last time that they don't give a crap what their constituents or the US want by selecting Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I know when to get out of an abusive relationship.
You're not selling me on Biden, if that's your goal. I am voting Green b/c they are offering Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and substantive criminal justice reform like reallocating police funds to community funds. To convince me to vote D, offer the same or better.
A president should have judgement, Biden exhibited failed judgement in this crucial moment. That's all.
I‚Äôm so very happy! Biden-Harris is a winning combination and you can see that the GOP are terrified! It‚Äôs glorious to watch them squirm. They all need to wear diapers now.
I think it's important to ask ourselves why we, as individuals, feel the former is futile. Consider when you have ever met an enthusiastic Joe Biden voter. Consider that ~40% of the eligible voters stayed home in the 2016 general. Is it math? Or is it something else?
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Mr. Biden would like to have a word with you, Bishop.
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
No.  Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war, voted for NAFTA, and authored the racist crime bill. Kamala Harris positively laughed at the thought of locking up the parents of truant children and fought to make sure that evidence that would free an innocent man was kept hidden.
Depending on the polls. If close, will hold my nose &amp; vote Biden/Harris. If not, will vote Green or do a write-in. Will try &amp; focus on who to vote for down-ballot. Priority is now non-electoral politics.
On top of just accusing Biden of being racist, rapist, and pro-segregation just a few months ago? Lmao that shit is hilarious
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
Trump is gonna kick his old wrinkley butt. Its a joke actually. Compare them really. Its a no brainer. Biden is history. No one I mean no one in their right mind will vote for him. There is not that many stupid people here in the US. Its getting close but no.
It‚Äôs an of guard picture, taken at the right moment and no context, used by a lot of trolls and bots to try and discredit Joe Biden. They been doing this since Obama was pres. Heres one of Trump with his preteen daughter looking like she‚Äôs twerking on him
Ha ha, she was chosen by the DNC and Biden had to play along. She‚Äôs full of crap just like him. They pander to anyone for a vote.
Trump is a racist joe Biden is a little less racist - y‚Äôall
All right, ready to convince the first person... joe Biden?! Uh oh.
Biden actually needs our votes and elected to nominate a ‚Äútough-on-crime‚Äù DA in the midst of protests for police accountability. You think he‚Äôll care once he‚Äôs in power?
It riles up the base and it informs those who are politically ignorant because they don‚Äôt pay any attention that Biden is a racist, which they may or may not care about.   This won‚Äôt change the minds of liberals who were OK with him raping a woman though.
LoL actually Trump and Barr would just write up a report that said Democrats interfered in the election because China and üôà [I‚Äôm just gonna pick another] Iran wanted Biden to win and would launch an investigation into that and hold hearings and appoint US attorneys etc.
If Wall Street is glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, where does that put all of the leftist "occupy Wall Street" folks?
Where's #MeToo now that Joe Biden is the Presidential Nominee?  Will Madonna want to blow up the WH if he wins?
Good so we agree that Biden is creepy. Better than being a confirmed rapist I guess.
All you need to know about Kamala Harris  1) Believed Biden's accusers 2) Called Biden out for supporting segregation when she was in school 3) Is descended from a slave owning family 4) The pilot of AF2 will radio the tower with "heels up" when taking off
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Don‚Äôt forget about the batshit Barr report about Biden‚Äôs son or something that will drop in October!
Sounds like 2012. But it was for Paul Ryan. And his VP opponent? Biden. And Biden "won" that debate.
I wonder: What will the Dems and Biden/Harris do if/when Trump attacks them from the left?
Photo Gallery: Meet Biden‚Äôs VP choice Kamala Harris
So define success for a guy like Joe Biden? Is he successful? Is it because he was elected each time? You don‚Äôt know Trump or Biden personally you just hate or love because someone told you to.  Be honest with yourself. What policies are you for or is orange man bad enough?
Regardless of how you feel about Biden, we need to vote for Biden because the next president will replace RBG. We don‚Äôt want another Brett Kavanaugh.
Harris will be the end of Biden's campaign. Like when McCain picked Sarah Pailin
Unlikable Biden just picked one of the least likeable presidential candidates that democrats didn't even pick for the nomination, and now you want us to believe this is the winning ticket?ü§£ü§£ü§£ get the fuqouttahea!
&lt;shiver&gt;   And I‚Äôm arguing with a black dude in the military right now saying he‚Äôs voting for Kanye and fuck Joe Biden because his portfolio has been constantly increasing.
It's still true. I'm not going to pretend that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are something that they're not. They're not progressive, they're not for the people, they're not an inspiration, they're a stop-gap. I voted Democrat for the last time; I won't be doing it again.
Ok..... But she's the VP pick. Biden does not oppose fracking.
Even Biden himself is doing it, the you ain‚Äôt Black comment for example - More Black people would be willing to vote for him if he had simply said nothing at all than trying to shame or guilt them into supporting him.   People really dont like being told they have no choice Lol
I think its about the fence, people can hate Trump, but having your own community treat you like youre dumb if you dont 100% agree or you dont see Biden as much better, or any opinion that isnt get Trump out at all costs - those are votes that could be had if they werent off put
Mr. Terrell, thank you for sharing your view about Biden's running mate.
If you vote for Biden, you support a racist segregationist.....  If you accept the nomination from a racist segregationist, you're desperate
Politics is all about persuasion though, and the way some of your tweets come off may make people want to double down on how they feel about Biden and Harris.   It lends itself to the same feelings of hopelessness and lack of choice that cause people not to bother voting at all
When I think of all the great people Biden/Harris have to choose from when replacing Trumps cronies, i get giddy with joy!   Warren, Beto, Buttigieg, Abrams, Col. Vindman, Yovanovitch, and more!
These replies treating Kamala like Paul Ryan in 2012(v Biden btw, who actually won that debate) even though we seen Tulsi already drag Kamala on a debate stage this year.
Maybe educate yourself on what the "National Debt" actually is.  44 increased the ND over 10 trillion, much of that became laundered money to elites. 44 and certain people in Congress were given millions. Thats how Biden got his millions.
Hey leftists form a real opinion instead of telling us what you heard about on the news Trumps not racist but Joe Biden and kamala Harris both are racist and flip floppy morons don't believe me I encourage you to look it all up yourself there's plenty of documentation üòâ
Taylor Swift is out here telling people about Biden unifying America, when literally every song she sings is about a guy who won‚Äôt unify with her.   And my wife will confirm, I don‚Äôt dislike her music. I just find it ironic.
Talk yo shit but remember this Biden/Harris ticket is what we voting for come November.
Obama &amp; Biden were Spying &amp; Lying. #MAGA2020Landslide #TrumpPence2020
Biden can not come out at night. Dementia,Sundowners Syndrome cause behaviors to escalate, such as mood changes, anger, crying, fear and wandering. Sundowning is thought to be triggered by fading light. The symptoms can get worse as the night goes on and usually better by morning
Can't Wait for Kamala to make "MinceMeat" of Phoney Mike in a debate.   #returnsanityvoteJoe
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
Kamala Harris just single handedly changed the slogan from "Ridin with Biden" to "Ridin Biden"
So you‚Äôve finally come to terms with the truth about Biden.
If the country wanted a black woman for president then Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt have won the democratic primary ü§î.  She isn‚Äôt qualified. This should be entertaining
How are we supposed to believe anything Kamala says if she can't even stand by her own statements that Joe Biden is a racist sexual predator?
Of course joe Biden would pick the fucking cop as his running mate.
I think Biden knows he doesn‚Äôt stand chance so he picked a Non starter
Ryan Knight is actually looking out for the people, which is more than Crime Bill Biden and Cop Kamala can say. Let's not try to rewrite history here. Biden is racist and has shown that many times, and Kamala isn't much better. They're better than Trump, and that's it.
Imagine all this shit with police and protests and riots happening and then Biden ‚Äúchooses‚Äù Kamala Harris that was Indian-American and now is African American to be VP...... the Democrats cannot get more stupid.
I may vote for Biden/Kamala, but I foolishly hope her earlier criticisms of Biden about racism and sexually predatory behavior were sincere. These are issues affecting everyday lives, and it just kinda seems like it was reduced to a political attack.
Today is a horrible day for the USA.  was added to  crazy ticket.  Folks, if you vote these two into office your next president won‚Äôt be Joe Biden...it‚Äôs a vote for #kamala because Biden is mentally compromised.  #VoteTrump2020
I do not think Biden would be a good President.
Ordered my yard sign and a bunch of other Biden/Harris swag, not that my neighbors have any doubts with the  yard sign and the  bumper sticker. Gotta make a bold statement when you're a blue voter in Alabama!
Completely agree with the Senate races. However, as an Alabama voter, what incentive do I have to vote for Biden/Harris?
She believes Biden‚Äôs sexual assault accusers but happily joins him as his running mate. She has zero morals and would blow anyone to further her career.
Thank you Team Joe and the Biden Camp for making this happen. Now that you have us, we‚Äôre going to the White House. üíõüêùüíõ
In one sentence you complain about Kamala being disrespectful to Joe Biden, and in the same sentence you call him‚Äùsleepy joe.‚Äù Projection anyone? Can you say misogyny?
This. Warren was my top pick for the Democratic ticket but you know what? She was one among many who would make a great President. So I‚Äôll be proud to support the Biden/Harris ticket and in the future Harris for President. Let‚Äôs #SaveTheRepublic and vote #BidenHarris2020 Nov 3rd!
I love Warren, but Harris is a solid pick, and I'm going to hang my Biden/Harris shirt next to my Persist shirt and wear the heck out of both. If Warren could be gracious and supportive today so can everybody else.
Jill Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP. There, fixed it for you.
Biden never had a chance in the first place between his comments on black people and Trump
In an effort to even the playing field, Barron Trump will debate Joe Biden
So Biden/Harris is worse than Trump/Pence????  I‚Äôm willing to listening!  No one has ever explained it to me so please inform me so I won‚Äôt be confused.
I don‚Äôt know what is happening locally in Seattle. So you‚Äôll have to discuss that with someone familiar with that overall. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that we need to elect Biden.
Democrats know their constituents have the attention span of a gnat, so remembering something like this will definitely be forgotten
I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, but every time I see a Republican claim that Biden/Hariis is far-left, it makes me want to vote for them a tad bit more than I previously did...
I don‚Äôt want any gear with Biden‚Äôs name on it.   Just put K A M A L A across the chest on a fitted black tee, pls.
Serious question didn‚Äôt she come out and say we must believe the sexual assault accusations made by Mr. Biden‚Äôs accuser. Something about women must be believed. Just wondering what changed her mind so fast
Legitimately, probably Warren, who‚Äôs CFPB plan Biden also fought üòî
Biden just really solidified his win by choosing Kamala üòÇ
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
Also, Biden himself has hinted at being a one-termer and anointing his VP as future leader of the party, so while it might have mattered less before, this one is much more determinant.
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
So her accusing Biden of being racist and pro-segregation just doesn‚Äôt mean shit because she‚Äôs pro UBI... MAKE IT MAKE SENSE LMAO WEAK
In case you're wondering, YES, the Biden/Harris merch is already up on the campaign store, and YES I'm going to get some after dinner.  needs a t-shirt. :)
Aight here me out. Hard Knocks type show but following the speech writers for Biden‚Äôs campaign
All jokes aside, I seriously can‚Äôt think of two living people more responsible for the overcriminalization of disadvantaged minorities than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   This ticket, with everything going on right now, is peak irony.   #KamalaHarrisForVP  #JoeBiden
I'm glad that's settled. Get me a yard sign for Biden AND Harris, and let's get on with winning the whole show in November. FIGHT FOR EVERY SEAT IN EVERY RACE IN EVERY STATE. Leave no GOP enabler in office.
But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs immediate. People have been not wanting her as a candidate and I‚Äôm not here for Biden at all. Will I still vote for them yes but I don‚Äôt think they are vastly different than a lot of the current administration, they just aren‚Äôt as loud or crass about it
Love this! Her theology must be vibrant and inclusive. She will be able to speak faith language to different groups of people. Good on Biden! Are you excited by this choice?
So if Biden is elected we will have to learn Chinese *and* French?  Cool.
She's Joe Biden's pick for Vice President. Who is Kamala Harris?

Harris is an excellent and smart choice in so many ways. This shows Biden is a fighter and is not afraid to build a strong team to lead this country. Harris challenged him and he stepped up and now they team up. Admirable!45 would have played the pity game cuz that‚Äôs his brand.
Way to go  !! You made an amazing choice. I can't wait to vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.
Joe Biden VP pick: Sen. Kamala Harris. Let‚Äôs get to work.
Don‚Äôt think Susan Rice won‚Äôt be in an active and visible role in a Biden administration.  State dept, probably.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yeeeeeah this is when it gets murky, innit. Harris, Biden, Trump, and Pence have all done things that are morally/ socially/political unacceptable. I don't think any should be representative. Obviously some more than others. But we need change, and we won't get it immediately.
To be fair, that's pretty much exactly what they're saying about Biden too. Sounds like a couple of moderates to me.
Right now it‚Äôs about preventing further regression. The Trump admin is hellbent on stripping LGBTQ+ and women‚Äôs health rights. They are filling the SCOTUS and lower courts with conservative justices...this can have an impact for generations. We have to vote Biden.
How y‚Äôall feel about Kamala Harris as Biden running mate?
Yes, I don‚Äôt think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.
Wrong!  I know of NO women who favors Biden- Heels up Kamala- resume the position that got you were you are - you passed the sniff test- Don't blow it üë†üë†üë†üë†ü§£
Joe Biden clearly picked Kamala Harris as tribute to recently fallen pro wrestler Kamala. That is what I choose to believe.
Honestly, it can‚Äôt matter right now. We have to stop Trump. I know it‚Äôs frustrating, but we have to vote for Biden and encourage others to do so as well. The future of this country depends on it.

Being a one issue voter (defund police) is a bad idea. Similar to people who vote republican just because of abortion. You aren‚Äôt ever going to agree with everything, but Biden and Harris are clearly far more capable of managing our govt than the damn circus that‚Äôs there now.
Democratic Party Presidential Ticket! Biden/Harris Congratulations! #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris
You do understand that defunding does not mean eliminate police forces and take all of their money right? And getting Trump out is the MOST important thing. We cannot go on like this. It is unethical to do anything but vote for Biden.
I, personally, am very excited about Kamala Harris as VP, more excited than I was about Biden as president (tbh, I wasn‚Äôt all that excited, not at all).
If Joe Biden didn‚Äôt want me to vote  all that‚Äôs all he had to say.
Don‚Äôt be like this. I don‚Äôt think anyone is thrilled but we NEED Trump out of office. We can squabble about getting an ideal candidate next time. In Nov, it has to be Biden and Harris. Please just encourage voting, let‚Äôs get Trump out, and move forward.

...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn‚Äôt the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn‚Äôt from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that‚Äôs a big reason why I personally don‚Äôt like Biden. So to say that the reasons he‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonized‚Äù are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She‚Äôs so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I‚Äôm damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden‚Äôs good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She‚Äôs going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?
I need this $400 unemployment to start coming asap so I can buy Biden/Harris Masks, Bumper Stickers, and Yard Signs ASAP!
Kamala: I believe the survivors of Joe Biden  Also Kamala: ‚ú®Joe Biden‚Äôs VP‚ú®
Biden needs to watch his food and drinks...it would be just terrible if someone slipped him something...
Mama doesn‚Äôt like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump‚Ñ¢ on Candidate Joe Biden's¬© naming of Kamala Harris¬Æ as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I‚Äôm excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I‚Äôll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!
ü§îWell, Well, Well, between Biden saying "they gonna  put y'all back  in chains" and Kamala changing the way she speaks in front of black audiences, We have a COMPLETE RACISTS COCKTAIL!!üò±üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fox news has been a platform for the democrats ALL DAY!! Democrats don't have enough guts to admit Biden is incompetent!!
BREAKING on #VP choice:  selects CA Senator  as his running mate. #KamalaHarris is the 1st black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Do you agree with Biden's choice of running mate? More details. &gt;&gt;&gt;
I couldn‚Äôt be happier!! She‚Äôs gonna be great VP. Damned proud of Biden
Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has ‚Äúbacked the blue‚Äù since it was a ‚Äústance‚Äù. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.
LMFAOOOO Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his VP. ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs screaming ‚ÄúAJ don‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù. DONT FUCKING WORRY
Joe Biden names Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket
i came to see what y‚Äôall had to say bout biden/harris ü§£
Does joe Biden know?
So she will run the country if they're elected. We all know Biden can't do it.
Joe Biden has just named Kamala Harris as his VP running mate. Now it‚Äôs time to really work and get this man to stop raging crazy stuff end get him in that White House
Love the Biden - Harris ticket. You have my vote and financial support. üëçüèø
JUST IN: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
More accurately, Joe Biden‚Äôs handlers tell him they have chosen a running mate for him
I would put nothing past Joe Biden, including that he's a sasquatch with a good waxing regimen.
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams Rips ‚ÄòRamblin‚Äô Joe Biden, ‚ÄòCome Here Joe, Sit ...
Amen. John Kasich is a damned Patriot. The real deal. The only true Republican left that doesn‚Äôt call themselves ‚Äúformer‚Äù . God bless him. We need a strong second party. I pray President Biden builds a bipartisan cabinet and really tries to heal our country from the bitterness.
Yep but every time he speaks it‚Äôs another Biden campaign ad
You got it all wrong. Biden goes to the basement and stays. Trump was whisked away but came back to finish Biden just stays in the basement and waits for the sky to fall
Of course they prefer Biden. Puppet.
Yeah if the league of women voters wasn‚Äôt good enough for you I didn‚Äôt think that would be I‚Äôm beginning to think that the only source you‚Äôll accept is Joe Biden‚Äôs website
Have you heard the way Biden talks about children?
The more we talk the more I think you‚Äôre just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn‚Äôt shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I‚Äôm not trying to rationalize anything I think you‚Äôre mad because there‚Äôs a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you‚Äôre right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she‚Äôs on enough ballots to hit 270 so let‚Äôs get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don‚Äôt believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he‚Äôs not Trump
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for Biden anyways I‚Äôm not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you‚Äôre admitting that Jo‚Äôs policies are better than Biden‚Äôs but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
And it‚Äôs not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.
YES!!! Russia is responsible for all the Trump signs and flags I see everywhere!!  And they must be the ones taking down all of the Biden signs!! because I haven‚Äôt seen ANY!!
I AGREE VP BIDEN! WE WILL VOTE COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,SLEET,SNOW,STORMS,ECT.. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE DIED FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS TO VOTEEEEEEE !!! THE ONLY WAY WE DON'T VOTE IS DON'T GO TO THE POLLS! TRUMP IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION AGAIN, SUPRESSING VOTES,CLOSING POST OFFICES!
Ah, so it‚Äôs the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!
did you hear him trashing Trump and bragging on Biden??üò°
This has already gone viral. We just need to keep retweeting and retweeting it. Damn what a ad.
üó£Ô∏èHILLARY CLINTON, LORETTA LYNCH, UNDER OBAMA, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 4 AMERICAN DEATHS IN BENGHAZI!! WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN HIDING?üò± IS HE IN THE BASEMENT WITH JOE??ü§î
I‚Äôll note down that you‚Äôre in favor of rule by executive decree in case it comes up during the Biden Administration. Or is that only when Trump does it?
IF WE LET TRUMP SAY AND DO THE THINGS THAT HE DOES AND SAY ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!! THEN WHY IN THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLWHEN VP BIDEN SAY ONE THING THAT SOUND OFF THE TRACK SOME TROUBLE MAKERS WANTS TO LYNCH HIM!!! YES WE HAVE LET TRUMP DESTROY AMERICA AND IT'S VALUE
Joe Biden said some woozy ass racist shit
Fair. It is quite entertaining. In a sad way. Like Biden.
Desperate: Biden grasps for Gretchen Whitmer as potential running mate
Lester the molester...oh I‚Äôm sorry...that‚Äôs Biden!!! I am shocked and amazed!!! NOT!!!

Well depends who wins. We know if Biden wins it won‚Äôt be covered and it‚Äôll be like it went away. If Trump wins it‚Äôll still be here end be the deadly pandemic the world has ever seen. I have no excuses, what would I be making an excuse about?
Biden‚Äôs criteria for his VP pic was what?  a. Black, b. Female, c. Nothing else. Not even the most qualified ‚Äúperson‚Äù in the country, only Black and Female that‚Äôs called making the VP position a quota filled position without consideration for other qualifications.

I wonder if Harris went to bed with Biden to get ahead like she did with  Willie Brown?
For 1 thing  didn‚Äôt get rich off the  lije  n his fatcat wife Elaine Chao Biden released 20 years of tax returns n financial records something trump is fighting in court to stop after the Supreme Court gave SDNY the go ahead to get his taxes he filed

I know this was an attempt at humor, but Bob Dole was a hero.  He fought for his country and was wounded.  I respected him.  As for Biden, I have more respect for Jeb.
Joe Biden endorsed this message.  then he forgot he did so.
No.  Absolutely not. Not one of those soldier's lives is worth risking on this engineered crisis. Let Portland burn. Let people see what voting for communists does. Let them understand in Cleveland and elsewhere that this is coming for them. All they have to do is vote Biden in.
Vote for Biden like our lives depend on it, because they do.
Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on President Trump‚Äôs Executive Orders to Sow More Chaos and‚Ä¶ by
Biden ain‚Äôt gonna do shit to help Americans. I don‚Äôt need an abortion or my student loans paid by my fellow Americans. So what is all of a sudden is he gonna do for Americans? He has yet to tell us.
Put a statue up and see if it stands as if I understood BLM dont want people or times to be known of anyone who supports black people. So Trump spoke the truth. Biden didnt know John Lewis either im sure.
Hillary, Biden and Obama can build it for them.
Biden during his ENTIRE political career has been against blacks.  Do some research, see the statements he‚Äôs made his entire life.
I just RSVP‚Äôd for Jill Biden‚Äôs keynote speech at Gun Sense University. Join me and thousands of my friends from  this Sunday at 3:45pm ET!  #GSU2020

And for the record, there are legitimate concerns about Biden. It‚Äôs just that Hillyer can‚Äôt write judiciously it seems about any Democrat. He‚Äôs there to hack away. The difference between Hillyer writing about any Democrat and Trump talking isn‚Äôt much. Neither know limits.
So this silly screed about Biden isn‚Äôt any surprise. It‚Äôs full of holes but there‚Äôs stuff there that the Limbaughfied GOP will love. Hillyer wouldn‚Äôt get away with much of what he‚Äôs written if those Trumper types hadn‚Äôt been built over the decades.
I knew a ‚ÄòNever Trumper‚Äô from Alabama would be back at what he did for decades. Hillyer‚Äôs hustle attacking Democrats using strawmen, overwrought language ... is useful. It‚Äôs a preview of what a Biden presidency will receive from ‚Äòconservative‚Äô outlets.

Joe Biden might say he is a devout catholic but his words and actions say otherwise!
You are correct about his aneurysm but he speaks and has written about stuttering since early childhood.  I am working hard not to be pissed off at people about this. I'm officially declaring today my last day of patience with this.
That is a sticking point with me, but I find Trump to be as close to an anti-Christ figure in 2020 as I can think of for a multitude of reasons that I'm going to give Joe Biden the win. Trump is pro-life only as far as courting anti-abortion voters. ProLife is much more than that
Yeah, because Obama stumping for Biden at a fucking funeral shows class right?President Biden
I'm voting for BIDEN/HARRIS !!!
We can believe ever breathe that Captain Mark Kelly takes!  Vote for HIM !  Whoever you are and wherever you are!.  Also, vote for Biden/Harris if you want a safe and sane United States !
Utter lawlessness in DEMOCRAT controlled city.  Vote Biden/Harris &amp; this shit (anarchy) becomes the new normal. No doubt in my mind when Trump wins in Nov, he will do whatever's required to finally restore law &amp; order by whatever means necessary. We've waited long enough.
BIDEN/HARRIS !  IS MY CHOICE, I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO VOTE !!

So when Joe Biden mangled ‚ÄúKamala‚Äù in his speech today, while reading from the teleprompter, guess that was ‚Äúdisrespect‚Äù tooüòè #LiberalHogwash #KAG2020
Everyone of you liberals have to cuss on some point of your tweet. Does that help get your point across? Oh and your an ass hat.  Prove that Obama and Biden did anything positive for our military or for our country for that matter.
I've a deep blue acquaintance who said years ago emphatically  emphasizing his political persuasion, "I'd vote for Mickey Mouse if he were a Democrat!" He told me after Biden's VP pick, that he's voting Trump. But he said Gretchen, Newsom &amp; weeks of Portland, sealed his decision.
how can Kamala Harris simultaneously call Joe Biden a racist, and a rapist, the two worst names you can be as a white man, then run as his VP üòÇ the democrats are such a joke ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And that‚Äôs your view. My whole point is about not voter shaming people. I disagree with you, but I‚Äôm not like if you vote for Biden then you‚Äôre voting for all the wars hes perpetuated, the racist systems he‚Äôs fought to uphold, and etc.
Dems say that EVERY YEAR. ‚ÄúIf this were a regular election‚Äù. I‚Äôm not debating you on if Trump is a fascist. He is, but it is counterproductive to tell people ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for Biden, you‚Äôre voting for Trump and everything he does‚Äù. And lmk when Alabama turns blue lmao.
&amp; likely future president...what are the odds Biden makes it to '24?
Those peoples‚Äô votes aren‚Äôt going to matter anyways. What‚Äôs the point in voter shaming someone who lives in a safe republican state that Trump won by 20+ points? There‚Äôs absolutely no point. It‚Äôs a waste of breath. If it‚Äôs a swing state, sure vote for Biden. But that‚Äôs not
Something that really gets me is the extreme views from both sides regarding what could happen if one candidate gets elected over the other. The country is not going to end if Trump gets reelected and neither will it end if Biden becomes president. It will just look different.
Not voting bc you dont like the option of biden or kamala is equivalent to voting for trump!   Those are our options, go vote.
I dont think so. I think there are enough republicans who are dis associating themselves from Trump and voting Biden as a one time deal. They wont ever be Democrats. They will be what keeps the party in check or the split will cause a new party. We are due for that historically.
Exactly! Sure I don't believe everything that Biden says or will do but I believe he has the character we need in this country right now.
Now we can stop asking who will Biden pick and get on with the race. Less than 100 days to go.

Wow doesn't he know that's what the primary season is all about, a healthy vigorous debate on the issues. It actually says a lot that Biden moved past that and picked her.

Even the less educated black person knows that the black vote MUST go to Biden/Harris. In the South where "Southern Political Segregation" dominates....white Republican Legislators often pass laws to suppress the goals of majority black cities.  Democrats support black cities.
Every derogatory statement kamala made about biden will now be chalked up to ‚Äúit was a debate‚Äù and the media will let her get away with it.  Disappointing, but not surprising in the least.
If Biden should elected he will be shown to be unfit to serve within the month. Ms. Harris will be president. That‚Äôs the plan.

It would be nice to see Hillary Clinton serve in Joe Biden's administration if he is elected on November 3. Democrats, again, it's up to us. If we show up in large numbers, we win. It is extremely important that we  show up in large numbers. ALL Democrats need to  vote on Nov. 3.
regretfully, the two party system and electoral college denies the freedom to vote for a more varying array of candidates. we vote the biden in, unless we want the trump again.
Would someone tell me why this is true? Joe Biden was a Senator most of his life and knows what the government is supposed to do and how it can work effectively - not where a party closes it in a crisis and goes on vacation.

Exactly.üòÜ I made the post in response to this Politico article:  ‚ÄòThe President Was Not Encouraging‚Äô: What Obama Really Thought About Biden
Did Biden tell you that? He tends to exaggerate(lie) about where he graduated. Trump graduated from Wharton which has the  #1 ranked MBA in the US. So I'll pass on the TDS infected liberal's opinion on his intelligence.
Simply put, the Obama admin coddled the world‚Äôs leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the Trump admin blew them to pieces and ushered in a peace agreement between neighboring states in the region.   Hard to chalk it up to anything else, but Biden and the media will find a way.
Of course Hillary was a shark of a politician‚Äîfully willing to take down anyone to be president‚Äîbut I hope she watches as Biden actually crosses the finish line, too. Like, why would she or Obama look down their noses at a man who‚Äôs almost universally liked? It‚Äôs straight elitism
If even a sliver of this is true, it actually makes me resent Obama. His elitism needs to stay far away from his public image, b/c frankly it makes him look like a technocratic asshole. I honestly hope Biden sails to victory by historic margins‚Äî&amp; I hope Obama watches it happen.

I didn't say Biden was a saint or even that he was a good candidate. I didn't even mention his name. What I'm saying is that Trump trying to claim that his opponent is racist is a stupid argument bc he is clearly racist himself. Not a zero sum. They can BOTH suck, which they do.
Saw your spot on MSNBC. We need every Dem senator and representative in Washington speaking out...Biden/Harris need your support as well as the Resistance....We must all unite to take our country back from the fascist wannabe dictator.
The difference is that I don‚Äôt agree w that what he thinks it should be. Like I said, simply put,  I think Biden is the better person but he is usually misguided in what is best for the country.  I think Trump is genuinely a bad person but he is more inline w policies.
Oh, absolutely not. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúboth sides are terrible‚Äù kind of person. Nothing annoys me more than people who only see wrongs of one party. Biden had an agenda.  However, in Biden‚Äôs case I think his agenda is more an attempt to make the country what he thinks it should be.&gt;

I feel like the left would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris. That spoke volumes. He is not my ideal choice, but I believe his administration would be more open to hearing and complying to our demands
It's really a no brainer, but I feel like the left sometimes would rather be right than actually get closer to the goals they set to achieve. Angela Davis is voting Biden/Harris and helped make my decision.
Can we do that right after Biden tells him he's fired?
So we can infer that expediency might have been behind her Kavanough slanders like it was her Biden Slanders?
Has anyone else noticed that the GOP has no plan on any isuess, no platform so they are just makimgbup scary things that Biden and Harris will do if elected? Losers. This includes you
Biden is such a idiot. We are not China you Alzheimer nut-job.
When Biden wins in November and gives his speech after the votes are counted I really really really want him to look straight into the camera and say, "Donald Trump, you're fired."

Yeah, Biden got it wrong today.
There's not a person in the white house that would try to correct Donald Trump in his blundering about history &amp; different years &amp; what happened during those years but he's got nerve to talk about Joe Biden being slow Trump can't pronounce English words that are used everyday.
I mean I‚Äôm clearly going to vote for Biden and Harris. I‚Äôm not going to like it. I‚Äôm not voting for THEM I‚Äôm voting to get that buffoon out of office.
I was wondering if CNN or MSNBC would cut away for trump. He purposively planned his media joke to take time away from Biden/Harris, but it didn't work. I mean, what did he say anyway besides, lie, blame, insult, and take credit for Obama's work.
Obviously Biden pronouncing her name ‚ÄúCamel-uh‚Äù is to get back at her for calling him a racist who she believes sexually harassed women.
Would you care to put your $ where your mouth is? We can each put $10k in escrow and whoever's candidate wins gets the $20k minus the escrow fees. I've already got piles bet on Biden +120, but I'll definitely take more action at evens. Let me know.
The beginning emphasis on Biden's filial love in Harris speech was a brilliant move. We as a nation are hungry for precisely that during COVID crisis. But it also serves as a stark contrast to Trump &amp; his family. What else do we expect from the son of a whoremongerer?
The only way I would not vote for Biden Is if he took Drumpf as his VP. I am glad he picked someone far more qualified. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Remember the Pandemic Response Team that Trump disbanded. That was Obama and Biden. If only Trump and GOP listened to the WHO, CDC, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. Trump is the President not Biden (not yet anyway). Trump was given the tools to combat Covid but he refused them all of it.
Pence: ‚ÄúYou locked up thousands of black people for non-violent crimes such as weed possession. Also, do you still believe Biden sexually harassed those women and is he still a racist?‚Äù  Drops mic and walks of stage.
Also, that‚Äôs a lie. She did not say ‚Äúfar worse things‚Äù about Biden.

Funny, That‚Äôs not what you said about Biden in the debates.
I love justice roberts! I'll applaud that choice ; )  I do wonder what you think disqualifies Biden. With regards to strict constructionists like Scalia, my experience is that they only apply that philosophy when it aligns with their right-wing agenda.
I think it's bcuz she doesn't associate with blacks... She said she Indian and Jamaican... Then after literally almost killing Biden's campaign and they beef... She ends up joining him... It's like she playing both sides .. It don't matter who wins as long as she in

See what he did there??   (There will NEVER be a Biden/Trump debate, btw)
Obama and Biden embrace equality and kindness for all; Trump hates everyone but himself; especially hates women.This statement is supported by Trump's record of continued abuse and denigration of women.  Trump needs to reconsider that hate, how the hell does he think he got here?
This is an absolutely blessed morning. Having blocked out the annoying Trump people and right wing propagandists, it has been going absolutely fantastic. The Biden/Harris celebration üçæ continues.
üëç on  Trump says he was surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
All Joe Biden‚Äôs choice did was make this war between black men and black women worse!
Great VP choice Biden couldn‚Äôt do any better
I look at the overall picture. Democrats have a strong record in protecting and preserving the two laws that are most important for me and mine throughout history. Biden/Harris 2020
is the leader we need in this nation at this time in history. The opposition will call names, whine and complain. The reality is, we need adults and responsible people to fix this broken nation. Biden/Harris will begin that process. I have never felt so energized!
Exactly! That‚Äôs why this clown is in office now. We have to rely on some of those Republicans (who are sick of Trump) to vote for Biden for him to win smh!
Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate! -
the DNC wants us all to go back to the Obama administration. back when they ended racism and nobody payed as much attention to politics. that‚Äôs what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent; it‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs VP and another black, and that‚Äôs all they are.
The only thing Republicans have is ‚Äúradical left‚Äù and tired name calling. They can‚Äôt call out Biden or Harris on issues with all the damage Trump has done.
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Joe Biden think he slick but most people already know wassup with her
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won‚Äôt this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
MJ or Lebron is stoking racial division? Biden said all black people are the same just last week. Why isn‚Äôt CNN reporting that.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù outcomes than a Biden one. That‚Äôs likely more scary to me than you, but that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is ‚Äúall there.‚Äù Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she‚Äôd be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that‚Äôs a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of ‚Äúthis progressive moment.‚Äù I‚Äôm going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
She speaks so well of Biden üòÇüòÇüòÇ. She called him a segregationist
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
President Barack Obama said presidential candidate Joe Biden nailed the decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate, and other Democrats have also praised her selection.
Again, I know why I'm voting for Biden/Harris. I'm excited. I must move on to share that excitement with other people I know. Good-bye.
We are All Sick to death of Trump savage attacks on anyone one who does not worship at the altar of the choosen one. Rejoice.  Biden and Kamala  Civility Dignity Honesty
i really don‚Äôt like Joe Biden, i don‚Äôt like Kamala Harris, i hate the 2 party system. i‚Äôm not even a democrat but i had a dream last night that Tr*mp got re-elected so i know what i‚Äôm going to have to do and again, i don‚Äôt like it.
üòÇ passion and strength! üòÇ Biden has been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision ever. Now he doesn‚Äôt know what office he‚Äôs running for or what location he‚Äôs at. Rick is the biggest Grifter I‚Äôve ever seen.
Biden like clinton likes them on their knees in oval office
Honestly.. with the choices in this election, I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone for not voting this time. I said what I said.. Trump is worse but.. Biden and Kamala are pure trash..
Dems, this election is too important to waste our time responding to attacks by bots, Trump people, and other Republican supporters.  Block them out!! Spend that time urging other Democratic supporters to rush to the polls on Nov. 3 and vote for Biden/Harris and other Democrats.
hey for those of you critiquing biden for picking a VP ‚Äújust because‚Äù she‚Äôs a woman of color, you should REALLY be more concerned that throughout history our leaders have been overwhelmingly white males ‚Äújust because‚Äù
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
I am in no way a politician or really even into politics, but DT gone win again because y‚Äôall don‚Äôt wanna vote for Joe Biden üò©
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Why not Joe Biden?
This is the main reason I would not be able to vote to Biden/Harris (there are a lot others, but this is the main)
She did not accuse Biden of being a segregationist. She challenged one aspect of his boast about being able to work with people he disagreed with.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Are the suburbans happy you kept minorities out of the neighborhood?  Probably if we're being honest...   Will it be enough to keep them from voting for Biden for social clout and to keep up with the Joneses? Probably not
You sure he didn't? How many people you think died because of the 1994 Crime Bill? Perhaps, you're just unwilling to face the truth that both Biden &amp; Trump are soulless sociopaths.
Can we put self-serving cancel culture on the back burner for ONCE? If we do not get Donald Trump out of office now, we may not have another election.   This isn‚Äôt about the needs/wants of few, this is about the needs/wants of many. Joe Biden is the most qualified candidate.
This suburban mom is 100% with Biden/Harris.
Biden is being controlled by the Squad and other far left Democrats.
And we are surprised that right wing media is attacking Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
I repeat. Just block the idiotic bots, racists, conservatives, and Trump people. It's easy and convenient. Then continue this momentus celebration üçæ  of....Biden/Harris 2020. It's a wonderful feeling. I love it!! üíò
For some reason, the DNC researchers determined that three factors motivated their voter base:  1) Mental deficiency  2) Pedophillia  3) Kwowing what Willie Brown tastes like  Joe Biden‚Äôs got the first two covered and Kamala can write Yelp reviews on number 3.
Wow!! I feel absolutely wonderful this morning. I thank God for this unspeakable joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
These idiotic bots and Trump people are trying to crush our celebration üçæ of our impressive Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Just block their misery and annoyance. Keep celebrating and spreading the joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
Yet, Biden voters are not labeled as ‚Äúcoon‚Äù lol I honestly want to know what the non-voters are doing for the country.
I am 100% supporting  the BIDEN-HARRIS  ticket! 100%!!!
I woke up this morning and saw these bots and Trump people tweets all over my phone/computer. It's ridiculous!! I immediately started blocking the morons. Dems, don't argue with them. They're not worth it. We don't need anything to impede our joy and celebration of Biden/Harris.
Precisely this.  is delusional. Nearly EVERY minority is excited for Biden Harris ticket. But more importantly, minorities are desperate to get rid of  Watch the blue wave.
Trump‚Äôs pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn‚Äôt care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Honey you legit cannot call anyone racist...pack your bags Donny boy! If Covid doesn‚Äôt get ya Biden/Harris WILL. Thank u, next.
I‚Äôm not voting for Joe Biden ever
Damnit Joe Biden damnit
Having said that I'm going to mute "Harris" and "Biden" before I set my mail in ballot on fire :)
Pam what's your angle? Why are you attacking Biden?
Medhi I hear what you're saying but until November 3rd it will be helpful is rose Twitter stops bashing Biden and helps us get rid of Trump and win the Senate. Biden isn't going to veto his own party and we can pull harder to the left with him than we can with Trump.
We need to celebrate üçæ Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate &amp; next Vice President
That‚Äôs a convenient perspective to ignore Biden‚Äôs cop VP recently saying he‚Äôs a racist whose guilty of sexually harassing women.   I suppose people truly will talk themselves into believing anything that allows them to continue supporting their ‚Äúteam.‚Äù
I heard ‚ÄúAngela Davis is voting for Biden. What do you know that she doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù üôåüèª
Joe Biden is the Presidential candidate
I was all Biden/Harris 2020!!! But then they said she was a phony, and a meanie, so now I just don't know who I should vote for.  I don't like meanies.
Burning down all the corporations isn't on the ticket this year. And if we try and force it on there then we will lose and they will get stronger and harder to beat next time. Obama/Biden admin signed Dodd Frank. Trump repealed it.
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
The right is getting what its way because they won. If Trump had said he was going to do all he's done, he wouldn't have won. Politics is hard. Biden wants to expand healthcare. Trump doesn't. That's not hard. M4A is one way. Its not the only way. You pick 1 guy. Not an ideal.
I didn't know you were a political philosopher. There is a reality where the next president will either be Trump or Biden &amp; if people don't work to elect Biden then there will be less progress. RBG isn't going to live forever. You want 6-3 far right scotus decisions for life?
Now y‚Äôall who follow my post know how much I love to troll the Republican Party but this time to be fair the Democratic Party Ôøºgotta get these jokes. Didn‚Äôt Kamala Harris Ôøºlast year say she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted all those women and there stories should be told.
I don't get the rhetoric that Kamala Harris was the only choice for AG. She turned down being Obama's AG. The notion that she is the only one who can be Biden's AG is ridiculous.
and this is an example of why Joe Biden is winning next month.
1) Body Language Expert Alleges Numerous Indications in the Presidential Debate That Joe Biden May Have Been Wearing a Wire | David Harris Jr.    I tweeted about his slack look and staring out over the crowd several times later in debate. I said Earpiece!
Important issue. Too bad Biden won't do anything about it.
Next week he‚Äôll be holding rallies saying ‚Äòsee I told you it was nothing, I‚Äôve got good genes.‚Äô  Left always takes the high road.  Biden campaign pulled it‚Äôs negative ads.   I really don‚Äôt care as long as we end this mess next month.
Our store is LIVE! We've got Biden-Harris gear, expand Medicaid merch, and of course, Alabama Democrats logo apparel so you can rep the scrappiest party in the South. Get it all here:
Trump doesn‚Äôt hide who he is and doesn‚Äôt pretend to be something he‚Äôs not.  is correct. Biden is a snake who will take on the cloak of anything to get himself elected. #TrumpLandslide2020
Newt Gingrich | Mark Kelly, Hunter Biden, and the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs Influence | Gingrich 360.  I‚Äôm sure (cough) Joe doesn‚Äôt know anymore about any of this than Comey about spying on Trump!
How many brain bleeds has Biden had ? How many coils in his brain? Right &amp; left frontal lobe is what they say  look up permanent damage this leaves  Could anyone run America with these defects ?
Lying Biden strikes again!
The single greatest act Jeff Sessions ever did, memorialized on film, was to knock Joe Biden's hand away from his granddaughter.
The problem with this take is that Cal is polling well ahead of Biden in NC. He leads Tillis by an average of six while the presidential race is tied. So I don't know that Tillis's problem has been being too close to Trump. It's that people just like Cal better.
The timing is entirely too strange. All that Trump has done and hasn‚Äôt caught anything, yet he goes to one debate and gets Covid? And Biden is suddenly ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù? Way too many red flags being raised.
More like 70-30 for Biden.  Americans are done with Trump, his corruption, and his crimes.  #LockHimUp
Please keep believing your own nonsense.  Biden will win in an electoral landslide because our country is sick of Trump, his lies and crimes, and his failure to protect us.  And once Trump is out of office, let the prosecutions begin.  #LockHimUp
Trump bans China travel. Biden ‚ÄúWe are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science ‚Äî not Donald Trump‚Äôs record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergenc
He advises Biden
Biden Tells Trump To Shut Up 'Will You Shut Up Man'
Jones just played a brief video endorsement by Joe Biden (Jones worked on Biden's 1988 presidential campaign). Biden urged Jones' re-election and added "The stakes in this election have never been higher for our country." #ALSEN #alpolitics
Joe Biden cannot qualify for Commander-n-Chief because he is being coached by Obama and merely a Democratic Party Leader according to him since he n9ow possesses more money than that political party has. Just a heads up Sen Cruz.
Thank you Mr/Mrs Biden.  In the end we are all AMERICANS
Just for the sake of argument, let us suppose that Trump gracefully bows out on account of his health and convinced he can't win the suburbs resigns and Pence becomes president. Pence defeats Biden in the 2020 election in an unlikely turn of events ü§î
let‚Äôs hear about Biden‚Äôs 2 frontal lobe aneurys as well. Everyone should know how servers they were &amp; brain loss from them
Give me a break. Would you be saying that if Biden came down with it? And I'm not for either side so don't think I'm a Trump supporter. I'm just saying that if the role were reversed every Biden supporter would say it was Trump's fault because he didn't work a miracle.
All Biden has to do is give a speech in a mask and say he trusts the experts and it's important to have good leadership and that's basically a negative Trump ad anyway.
I think if joe bidens campaign pushed the ‚ÄúBig Perc Biden‚Äù narrative he runs away w this election
Joe Biden tests negative for the Presidency!
God forgive you  voting for brain damaged Biden  2 frontal lobe aneurysms  read about that damage  My sister had 1 with medications that Biden didn‚Äôt have  never same
Herd of sheep with CNN &amp; brain damaged Biden &amp; BLM lover Kamala.  prayer for our President &amp;FLOTUS
Remind her of what Joe Biden said if Mitt Romney won.   It never happened. "Biden tells African-American audience GOP ticket would put them "back in chains" - CBS News"
Biden said ‚Äúin conclusion thus what happens when you don‚Äôt wear your mask‚Äù üòÇ
WITHOUT TRUMP‚ÅâÔ∏è‚ÅâÔ∏è That‚Äôs Wouldn‚Äôt Be Fair, but that‚Äôs the way you Cowardice repub‚Äôs operate. It would give Biden the chance to talk to the People without being interrupted, you still want it to go forward? Let‚Äôs Do it, without trump!
So by simply holding ... excuse me ATTEMPTING to hold the President to the standards that his team had agreed to he was trying to help Biden? i would say he was trying to help the American people.
Just another Lie and Con!  Thought Biden was going to pull out the remaining debates, and he didn‚Äôt. He does not want to put the time in to prepare. His poll numbers are plunging, he was getting hammered on the debate and his love of white hate groups.
Whether it‚Äôs Trump or Biden were fucked either way
I‚Äôm curious why he didn‚Äôt ask Biden what he meant when he said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for me, you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù.
Oh, Pmease  spare us a whole day of CHRIS Wallace saying I‚Äôm told Biden group came into debate wearing masks but First Family didn‚Äôt. Has to be inserted into this as he whined this morning he hoped he was far enough away from Trump not to be exposed.
Biden was on the same stage as President Trump. If Biden catches it will you be as happy to see him die? 47 years in office he has be caught lying, plagiarism, racist actions, and the list goes on. Does all people that you don‚Äôt like deserve to die?
Trump doesn't really have Coronavirus. He's just using this as an excuse to lay low now that even Fox news is calling him out for courting white supremist and violence. He also now has an excuse to not have to debate Joe Biden after performing so badly. He'll emerge just fine!
He is a clown. He is repulsive. He is a racist. He is your idol. He called a pandemic a hoax and said it is what it is when 200 died. All this tweet shows is Biden is a decent man while you, well, typical MAGA.
12:54 a.m  tweets about his Covid test.  7:30 a.m Peter Doocy reports Biden probably doesn‚Äôt know yet bc he doesn‚Äôt usually get up til 8. Who do you want to be potus?
Peter Doocy tells   that Biden may not know about Trump‚Äôs‚Äô Covid rest bc ‚ÄòBiden TRIES to get up by 8 a.m.‚Äô. Wow! I‚Äôve been seeing news since 6:30 so know more than potential president? Can you imagine Biden schedule? Up-8. Breakfast 9; 2 calls-nap. Lid
No. They Tested Positive. Big difference. Praying no symptoms. Isn‚Äôt it convenient for Biden?
Didn‚Äôt we say it wouldn‚Äôt be long before either Biden or Trump would test positive for Covid to 1) STOP DEBATES 2)Get a MASK MANDATE 3) STOP TRUMP RALLIES.    We pray it‚Äôs fake but if not that   and Hope Hicks do not get sick. The media about to go nuts!
He is most likely still lying.... benefits include;  1) Doesn't have to debate Biden 2) He can say he has it, recover and say its all a hoax
just using ur logic you think trump is those things so all of his supports are those. i think biden is so therefore you are ;)
Trunp &amp; Biden got Covid or nah? what's happening?
Lol  how Trump was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask so often and now look #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid
Hoping Biden wasn't infected at the debate. A rare unmasked event for Joe.
But Biden didn't.
He could've been exposed at the debate. Trump's yelling for 90 minutes would've sent aerosol virus into the whole room, if he does test positive. Biden was unmasked.... Lord, lord keep Biden safe.
No sir, Joe Biden does not turn me on.......I‚Äôm a dude,  OT a little girl so ole sleepy Joe won‚Äôt like me anyway.
But why? I thought it‚Äôs just a flu or a hoax (I don‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs the latest version). Looks like Trump is so scared of Biden he‚Äôs faking a quarantine to avoid the next debate. üòÇ
Hahahahaha!  You made me spit sweet tea on my cat!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The socialist leftist extremists who pull Biden‚Äôs puppet strings, who want to overthrow our constitution scare me a whole lot more than a narcissist who has fought tooth and nail for our country.
Biden calling Trump names I guess is what you would consider mature and acting like an adult.  Your problem is you don‚Äôt like Trump‚Äôs personality, but you can‚Äôt come up with a good policy reason to vote against him.
Now do Joe Biden.
Biden is far from a leader. He‚Äôs been rejected as a presidential candidate twice already. Was rejected for Hillary in 2016. 47 years, only thing he ‚Äúlead‚Äù was crime bill putting numerous blacks behind bars. You remember Justice Thomas hearings? Biden no leader then either.
Don‚Äôt be a fool Josh. She admitted that she misspoke.  She confused Rhodes College with Rhodes Scholar. Now, there‚Äôs no confusing UDel with HBCU Del State, so go after Biden. AND, Biden didn‚Äôt teach Constitutional law for 20 years.
Biden Tells Trump To Shut Up 'Will You Shut Up Man'
Yeah, I agree with that sentiment for sure. I'm not for complete deregulation.  I don't want to vote for Donald Trump because he's an absolute asset. And Biden a little better.And Jo talks about total liberation. But its like.. damn. Can we have. A medium here??
Gave the eulogy of Sen Byrd who founded WVA KKK, called him his mentor.  read excerpts from letters Biden wrote to infamous racist White Supremacists inside/outside Senate
Trump just condemned the Proud Boys, the KKK and white supremacy on Hannity and attacked Joe Biden for his superpredators comment and for supporting the 1994 crime bill
What an outstanding iteration of  ‚Äòs racist history.1984 ‚ÄòSuper Predator‚Äô Crime Bill  Bill Clinton signed that HIllary followed up with her famous 1996 Super Predator remarks about blacks. Biden called Sen Byrd his mentor. Byrd started/headed WVA KKK
Joe Biden is the white power candidate. Donald Trump let the superpredators out of prison. Joe Biden pals around with segregationists and supported the 1994 crime bill and Defense of Marriage Act
I am sorry you don‚Äôt care about the opinions of your viewers. Many are tired of this continued story, after POTUS has repeatedly denounced white supremacy and affiliated organizations. Just google it and you can see montages of them. And please ask Biden the same
Chris Wallace: Trump 'bears the primary responsibility for what happened' at the debate  #FoxNews Can Democrat Chris Wallace please leave Fox and go to CNN or MSNBC where he belongs?
Sorry, maybe you do not realize that Biden's coach is Obama. Biden believes he is The Democratic Party but yet has he considered what position a President has most high, The Commander-n-Chief which Joe cannot function as.
You were being subjected to Biden's comedy takes to avoid answering any question so you should have ignored him.
Biden brought him up to play the sympathy card while being questioned about Hunter. If he can‚Äôt answer he defers or laughs.
You choice of men should have been Joe Biden who Trump angered that diversity Trump has banned that Biden was initializing against African Americans, who supplies that majority of Arabic Gum for the world.
Joe Biden‚Äôs Vacant Debate (And Eyes).  Love Jed like black contacts to me as though light sensitive. Same when he got off train next day.
Did Biden really just say that Trump and his friends look down on Irish Catholics like him. Butttttt Amy Coney Barrett is TOO Catholic to be in the Supreme Court!!! üò©üò©üò©üò© I cant take it!!! (Pat screeching voice) #agonizing
I didn‚Äôt get a chance to vote but just want to say we can‚Äôt let the GOP stay in power.  Everywhere that Biden is insufficient Trump is way worse.
Poor  CHRIS Wallace has a memory as bad as James Comey‚Äôs and Joe Biden‚Äôs
I have been working out 7 days a week for 5 years. My pecks have improved, but they are nothing like that. I only do one hour a day. But honestly, I don't want to look like Rock. And I am not big on Joe Biden-- I don't care how many pushups he can do.
Everyone runs interference for Biden , who will really be running the Country? Did they take Biden adds down ?
Screenshot of my post yesterday Annie. I agree that the debate was awful. Offal may be a better descriptor. However, that said, Biden is a policy disaster in every way.
So why are you anti-Trump? And you think Biden would do better?
If it came to passing a surprise drug test, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate in picking Hunter Biden over Donald Trump Jr. Donny stays lit like a 1980s Colombian. #boogersugar
I you didn‚Äôt.  You‚Äôre a complete fool to believe you did.  Biden looked calm and collected.  You acted like a petulant toddler. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
I‚Äôm honestly confused how is a person suppose to vote between Biden OR Trump ?? Is this a joke.. They‚Äôre both nasty AND racists ??? So what am I supposed to do ?? I guess packing a bag and moving to a far away mystical fairy land is the only option for me
Biden is signaling us

This made to seem Hunter used Joe without his knowledge. Not so! Hunter flew in AF2 with Joe to China and back. Famous Joe interview about having Ukraine Prosecutor fired. Hunter getting Burisma deal after following Joe to Ukraine. Joe is dirty no doubt.
Don't come after Amy Coney Barrett because she's religious. Most of us are. Come after her because she's coming for abortion rights.

I would love the opportunity to put them on a soup diet. Biden believes this is an idea worthy of discussion.
are you Really pushing the polls that were so wrong in 2016 singing that worn But Soccer Moms Don‚Äôt Like Trump‚Äôs Aggressive stance?  is becoming CNN. CHRIS Wallace interrupted Trump 76x and Biden 15. But you won‚Äôt talk about your BIASED buddy
Everyone needs to go to  to watch Biden‚Äôs website pop up. The head of national White Supremacists endorses Joe Biden
The head if White Supremacy group endorsed JOE BIDEN and he didn‚Äôt denounce them. He won‚Äôt denounce Antifa either bc it‚Äôs website takes you to Joe‚Äôs website. Don‚Äôt believe me? Go to  to see it
Someone ask Joe Biden why he‚Äôs wearing BLACK contact lenses. Had them on in debate and on train ride. Something is wrong.

Joe Biden We Support You 100%
Setting up the narrative for when he loses. Republicans will quickly blame 1) Covid deaths and 2) the failing economy on Biden
I truly believe ppl like this don‚Äôt know jack shit about what will happen if Biden wins
Really bad Biden
So the Commission on Presidential Debates is also compromised... whatever you have to do protect Biden and prevent Trump from destroying his ass! All assets have been activated, win the election by all means necessary! #CancelTheDebates
This is Joe Biden's vison for America.
Do you think Chris Wallace was unbiased? He seemed to coddle Biden and evening protect him when he started to fumble his words. He asked Trump hard questions that could‚Äôve easily been asked if Biden, but weren‚Äôt.
Why won‚Äôt you condemn Antifa and BLM, both extreme left wing radical terrorist groups? Why didn‚Äôt you ask Biden to condemn them?
Joe can't keep up, it is not about us, it has to be about what we think we need to do about a Commander-n-Chief but Joe that is not you to be engaged in if you think it is about us cause we need a Commander-n-Chief not just a man named Joe Biden.
Biden Stands With the Lawless Mob | Opinion
So much for the invisible moderator!  Wallace definitely carried Biden‚Äôs water last night. Disgusting and outrageous.
Sure when he said Joe Biden shouldn‚Äôt be President
Biden should have never entered politics.
Naturally suppressing Free Speech. ‚ÄúOh, you must do as we tell you even if you are President of United States.‚Äù I‚Äôd tell them fine in exchange for drug tests/ear piece/wire checks and No Notes. Biden was reading last night too.
Something to ponder. Perhaps Trump runs his campaign, not the other way around. Biden campaign does run Biden, not the other way around.
SIMPLE DEMS SAW DURING DEBATE ONE: Joe Biden cannot inflate a balloon.
That's bad linguish to a teacher putting teacher out of the role that is playing. President Trump said Biden called African-Americans super-predators. The BBC coverage of the debate is terrible being a blog with pages on past articles,
you Must coach Trump to be more patient in debate to let Biden get into flailing mode before he jumps in. Next moderator is a true LeftWinger who will be worse than Wallace
‚ÄúWill you just shut up‚Äù Joe Biden
Biden been in office for 47 years and hasn‚Äôt done shit but now he wants us to believe he will do something, yea ight. Only thing he gonna do is kiss his grandchildren on the lips and sniff women hair.
This reminds me of people disappearing in photos in Back to the Future. Which, incidentally, could work as a Biden campaign slogan.
Let‚Äôs get one thing straight, I‚Äôm not voting for Biden.   This election is a joke, but it‚Äôs also important.   GET OUT AND VOTE
Commission on Presidential Debates Issues Statement after Last Night‚Äôs Trump-Biden Debate    #Campaign2020 #debates
We should all vote for Biden simply off the fact that he is actually a politician.  Having money can get you literally anywhere. Ex: Trump as POTUS.  So can we please give the job to someone who actually cares about the role of POTUS.  Someone who actually can be a vessel for us.
Trump was so barbaric last night.  He couldn‚Äôt even follow the rules he agreed to following. The interruption‚Äôs, the talking over everyone, that low blow about Biden‚Äôs sons. Very low class behavior  The poor moderator Omg I know he poured up done scotch straight after the debate.
Biden isn‚Äôt gonna do anything he‚Äôs gonna keep it like it is the basic racism we know. Trump is actively going to make it worse than when they burst into peoples houses shooting up all the black people you‚Äôre ‚Äúshows his cards‚Äù argument leaves more of our brothers dead
Biden wearing a wire?  Doesn‚Äôt look like a shirt crease to me
It was a long time ago and Joe Biden was probably kinda racist this isn‚Äôt big news but Trump is Viciously racist and he emboldened his other racists he told white supremacist to stand back and standby as if he‚Äôs leading the army so get out of here with that

At what point did Biden forget who his son was? Biden was talking about how tRUMP disrespects the troops, BAEU Biden was a troop before he passed from cancer. TRUMP (#TrumpIsARacist ) brought up Hunter because reasons? Coz Trump had no plan except to be shit
Andrea Mitchell asked the question about Biden calling Trump a clown, WHAT. Trump calls ladies nasty and ugly / he uses profanity/ he abuses ladies and calls everyone names. Trump is disgusting and disrespectful: he shouldn‚Äôt be called a clown. Andrea, maybe you should go home.
First of all, no one wants you as a leader. Stop projecting.   Second, only you use immature name calling like ‚Äúloser.‚Äù   Third, you literally refer to Bernie as ‚ÄúCrazy Bernie‚Äù and just disrespected Biden by calling him ‚ÄúSleepy Joe.‚Äù
'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' Talk Show: Baseless Online Claims Target Biden Ahead of First...
He said ‚ÄúBiden‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù a few times
Can thank Biden for that one, 1994 crime bill.
My take on this: It was African Americans who chose Biden over Sanders. So, now, if they end up with four more years of White Supremacy on steroids, so be it. They have nobody to blame except themselves.
Biden sums it up nicely here...
Yea...and Joe Biden went to Delaware State
I mean, you called this TV (so Telemundo viewers could ask Biden questions) a teleprompter.  Sooooo, yea.
Hearing Biden say he‚Äôs proud of his son for overcoming his addiction to cocaine, just made me happy but so sad at the same time. Kids are off limits, no matter how old they are. Trump is disgusting. I can‚Äôt believe you guys elected this man president.
Joe Biden came to debate Tuesday night; "President" Trump came to launch a food fight.
What I‚Äôm getting after catching up on it post-debate:  Trump is every bit the pompous jerk we knew him to be.  Biden lacks the mental capacity to be president and refuses to answer key questions.  Chris Wallace sacrificed a lot of his integrity.   The next 4 years look rough.
‚ÄúI am the Dem Party now!‚Äù So own it. Biden allows anarchists Antifa (idea not org) and BLM marxists to burn/loot/injure.  pulls up THIS! Now you know his üí∞supply.   NO to Green New Deal &amp; Manifesto. Oops!
is up to the task. She will keep him in his proper place &amp; we'll hear Biden's plans. Or, he will spiral out of control &amp; spew racist misogynist slurs openly on live TV &amp; will lose even more (suburban, white) votes. #VoteHimOut #Debates2020
MMA fight of year:  Wallace/Biden team vs  This morning on  Dem surrogate said: CHRIS Wallace said it best... So Mr Invisible spoke for Biden. Wallace interrupted  72x vs 15 Biden. He helped Biden through answers

Trump &amp; Biden Debate 1: Highlights, Lowlights &amp; Reaction | DIRECT MESSAG...  via
It was a disaster on the debate. But I'm leaning towards Joe Biden. The president can't function well under pressure. He was getting personal.
However, if that is the new format, I wish Trump would just wait for his to minutes to clean Bidens clock, and let Biden stand there and make a fool of himself uninterrupted!
When did they start with not being able to respond to attacks? Biden was on full force attack mode and Trump wasn't able to defend the comment? What did Biden say he would do for the American people?
His handlers are telling Biden what to say. Nobody but Trump tells Trump what to say. Biden reminds me of the great OZ. Just need to pull back the curtain.
They bickered on who should appoint the next Supreme Court justice, their stances on health care and even brought each other's families into the fray.
BIDEN is the murderer.  You think that he will make this country "great" again? If he is elected,  we will be a socialist country.
NBC‚Äôs Lester Holt called it ‚Äúa low point in American discourse.‚Äù    #Decision2020
You didn't miss much, have you heard Biden speak with out (a shot of dope) IMHO! Why not take a urine test, what's he hiding!
Biden's, but it took everything he had to get through this debate. Why no urine test Joe? What's he hiding? Earcheck as well? If you have nothing to hide. Biden answers no questions üôÑ
Chris and he favored Biden, Trump should have let Biden hang himself.
I‚Äôm sure it will be much better than the health plan that was Crammed down our throats during Obama/ Biden years. And with our President you will see it before it‚Äôs passed. You know no passing the bill to see what‚Äôs in it...
Biden and Kamala ..they really fakin it till they make it..what are the doing for black people ? What plans ?
I didn‚Äôt like him at all ! He was light on Biden and heavy on the President, seemed disrespectful at times . Ran interference for Biden all night !
The President wouldn‚Äôt have been able to say anything since All Chris was doing was running interference for Biden. So wrong!
Biden Tells Trump To Shut Up 'Will You Shut Up Man'  via
The people following Cruella Ingraham and Bow tie Bigot Carlson; all blaming Chris Wallace because Trump‚Äôs lunacy was on full display AND Biden did it with a grin! #ThisClown #WillYouShutUpMan
#BidenWonTheDebate  Trump acted like the bratty child he is, while Biden attempted to actually have a grownup debate. I wonder if Trump will bring his crazed stalker routine to the next debate, and circle behind Biden breathing heavily?
I also think Chris Wallace ran interference for Biden !
That part was very confusing and unresolved. Biden never clarified how his strategy would have been any different, just that Trump was bad.
Joe Biden should not be in a Presidential debate as name signifies it would be for Presidents &amp; all he was before was a VP and nothing close to being Presidential. So change the name next time from Presidential debate to something else closer to Debate of Candidates for President
Already voted for Biden.  Tonight‚Äôs debate strengthened my decision to vote for Biden.  Go vote.
According to  nope, impossible.
The cognitive dissonance it requires to love Trump and accuse Biden of being a child molester is truly astounding.
So folks, tell it.  Who do you think ‚Äúwon‚Äù this debate?  I believe Biden handled him very well.  It was obvious to me who the next president should be.
Idiot celebrities and their love affair with Biden and Socialism!!!
I‚Äôm honestly and wholeheartedly proud of Joe Biden for being the statesman even when he utterly disgraced his dead sonüëèüèø Lead by grace not hate!
Joe wholehearted believe America is a Organization and that another Organization can provide the Debate with different numbers which he depends on. Way to go Joe WALK THAT MILE IN OTHERS SHOES! Biden must kinder to the UK British Organisational words.
Insults only came from Biden, name one time trump threw out an insult...
Did Trump say that Biden wants to get rid of cows?  I seem to recall him saying that, but it's so absurd and ... Nevermind.  It's Trump.  And I know he said it.  Wow.
In a trainwreck Debate, its not much of a victory for Biden.  But its one of the few he can enjoy, if he can enjoy it.  So let the old man have it for what its worth.
y‚Äôall remember when Joe Biden said during the primary saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt vote for me‚Äù?
biden should‚Äôve went in on trump ass
NOT HIM DOING THIS. TRUMP LITERALLY ASKED BY BIDEN AND A FOX NEWS HOST TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND HE DOESN‚ÄôT. THE RACISM REVEALS ITSELF
biden wasn‚Äôt wrong with the ‚Äúclown‚Äù remark. for a businessman, tonight reeked of how truly unprofessional 45 really is.
If there were people that went into this thinking Biden and Trump were cut from the same cloth they came out the other end knowing that was a lie.  We cannot put our country through four more years of this.
I can‚Äôt even fault Joe Biden for this shit show. The President (if you can call him that) brought the shit and Chris Wallace just brought the show.
I think Trump did a great job debating both Chris Wallace and Joe Biden.
Or maybe because they sense the Fragility of Biden now?
Politics aside, Joe Biden‚Äôs humanity and ability to be vulnerable about the struggles of his life is a testament to his faith and something to admire.
I believe he already did..he deamed the KKK as a terrorists organization.   Joe Biden couldn't answer crucial questions tonight. I wonder why...
Joe Biden responded to ugliness with decency and showed us all what a president could be.  Who cares if he stumbled on some words, he‚Äôs elderly after all, it‚Äôs expected.
President Trump , why , because he is a Great President, who actually cares about the American People! Joe Biden is not up to running this country . President Trump has gotten so much done and he has taken incoming the entire time !
Trump would have been better off letting Biden trip himself up but he never got the chance because he kept interrupting
You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm just curious as to how they can read all the word for word racist (directly towards African Americans) statements that Biden has made...but yet Trump is racist for what he didn‚Äôt say in response to a white supremacy question. Ppl are mad he didn‚Äôt say something
Keep that shit street Biden. Don‚Äôt come on here with allat
The Antifa Idea Not Organization per Biden sure burnt down a lot of towns
Why didn't Biden take a piss test? You see how humiliating that is? Why ? Why, why wouldn't he?
If you liked Trump, you had mixed feelings but thought he did well.  If you liked Biden, you had mixed feelings but thought he did well.  If you liked Wallace... wait aminute?
From my various social media feeds it appears as though there were 3 debates tonight:  1. Trump showed what he was made of despite debating both his opponent &amp; the moderator. 2. The future of America depends upon Biden. 3. The whole thing was a dumpster fire.  #debates
Joe Biden and Donald Trump when they won‚Äôt stop talking to each other.
Ruh Ro. Biden says He‚Äôs the Democrat Party now. Doesn‚Äôt support Green New Deal. No Manifesto!
boyyyyy Biden handed you your ass tonight!!!
Joe Biden? Sure, he could have done better.   Chris Wallace? He could have done a lot better, but look at what he was dealing with from Trump.  Donald Trump told the Proud Boys to stand by, and failed to condemn white supremacists. I just wanna point that out.
Is deciding he is the lessor of two evils the same as supporting?  Trump is an ass, but Biden is a shell.   Are you saying Biden is an ideal for the future?
Well if you prefer leaders like KP OLI ,who is limited to words, then Biden is not the answer.
Did anyone else notice Biden looking at his podium Reading his response?
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt running against Joe Biden.   Donald Trump is running against the election.
Horrific moderation. We thought Candy Crowley was biased but CHRIS Wallace wins by gazillion miles. His rudeness to President whine kid gloving Biden was atrocious
You shouldn‚Äôt want my take, but here it is: Not many minds weren‚Äôt changed. Trump won law and order and green new deal, Biden won health care and Covid. But all Biden really needed to do was to not be senile on stage, and he wasn‚Äôt. So yeah, Biden won.   #debates
I only caught the end and it was them just shouting over each other and not answering the question. But you see biden appeals to the camera and audience as where trump is very defensive and sticks to his guns. Two very different approaches. I just hate politics in modern america.
Biden won that debate just because Trump lacked a crowd and self control.
Trump bc he had to debate Wallace and Biden.  is about to lose a viewer
Those other people are not even on the ticket, so why are you mentioning them. Vote for the country, which means vote for Biden. Be responsible. What are you trying to prove?
To be clear, I‚Äôm voting against Trump, but I have a ton of respect for Biden after that. Dealing with Trump is fucking exhausting.
wait is the clock on biden‚Äôs side broke i just timed one of his ‚Äú2 min‚Äù at 4:36 sec before trump finally budged in üòÇ
I actually would like someone to ask Biden what progressive policies he DOES support. #Debates2020
All I gotta say is if you watched this debate and still believe Biden your a ‚Äústupid bastard‚Äù lol
Also, notice how DJT keeps coming back to the same attacks on Biden‚Äôs ‚Äú47 years‚Äù and how beholden he is to the ‚Äúradical‚Äù left (hahaha) and the typical business about him being a victim of the liberal media. It‚Äôs the same playbook and he‚Äôs drilling these messages in. #Debates2020
won‚Äôt listen to a word you say after your ‚Äòfriend‚Äô Wallace debates Trump at every turn and covered Biden. Disgraceful!
Moderator: ‚ÄúPresident Trump you have two minutes to talk uninterrupted‚Äù  Biden: *speaks* Moderator: ‚Äúlet Mr. VP speak‚Äù  This debate is biased because they know Biden can‚Äôt keep up.
Biden is just gonna F-off the Left tonight.
So Chris Wallace, is helping Trump by explaining how Chris read Biden's plan, and asked specific question on the policy.  When did he ask Trump about his direct policy? Does Trump have one?
Great news  Joe Biden is going to stop hurricanes!
Former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump will be in the same room Tuesday for the first presidential debate.
Joe Biden Said He Can‚Äôt Have A Debate With That ‚Äúclown‚Äù his wordsüòÇ
He‚Äôs been awful. Biden‚Äôs babysitter.
Biden pulled strings to get his son in the military and he didn't last a month before he got the boot for being a coke head.
CHRIS Wallace was a disgrace tonight. He debated  more than Biden. He covered Biden‚Äôs fumbles, rudely lectured a sitting president while carrying Joe. We knew it would be biased but this display was obscene
Joe Biden gettin R*ped
This debate just reinforces for me that the election is all about Trump. Love him or hate him and which side has more. No one is voting for Biden. No one cares about Biden, which is bad for Trump.
If i was Joe Biden son i would pull up on DT sons with it on the tuck nigga foh lmaoooo id spark some shit
Trump, he tries to answer, Biden just distracts
I‚Äôve timed it. Biden gets over 3 mins and Trump is cut off as Wallace debates Trump himself.
Man if you don‚Äôt shut the fuck up are we seriously taking down points for Trump based off of Joe Biden‚Äôs sons cocaine usage? IS THAT HOW WEAK OUR PRESIDENT IS?
Biden wants the glovesü•ä let em go a couple rounds
I find the well scripted raising of Biden's dead son as a gotcha in a debate distasteful, and I'm glad Trump made it about the other son.
THIS MAN JUST WENT IN ON BIDEN‚ÄôS DECEASED SON, YALL, I CANNOT
He keeps bringing up Biden‚Äôs son, but how much have his kids gotten from the American people due to his nepotism. #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden said don‚Äôt speak on his mf son or it‚Äôs gon be problems bih !  And that‚Äôs that !
Every time Trump has Biden on the ropes  Wallace changes the topic. What an absolute disgrace as a moderator. We knew you‚Äôd carry Joe‚Äôs water but your rudeness to our President is astonishing.
BIDEN OR TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY! üó£üó£
I'd rather hear Trump and Biden yelling over each other than Chris Wallace yelling over both of them.
'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' Talk Show: 'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' FactChecking Biden‚Äôs SCOTUS S...
Biden didn‚Äôt even answer the original question, so I‚Äôm taking it as No he doesn‚Äôt support ‚ÄúBLM‚Äù ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yea we screwed either way !!!
Biden's argument of I'm only running for office not in office so I can't answer questions about court packing or violence is weird.
Biden don‚Äôt wanna defend the police but he the only one we got bye
Chris Wallace perpetuating the ‚Äúgood people in both sides‚Äù LIE and calling CRT ‚Äúracial sensitivity training‚Äù and Biden calling Trump a racist and talking about dog whistles is disgusting. #PresidentialDebate
it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway. he already doing it to Biden.
I‚Äôm all for Biden, but my man, suburbs are not integrated now. #Debates2020

Trump is racist. If you support him or hate on Biden you are too or racism just doesn‚Äôt bother you that much.
New drinking game- everytime Biden stutters or forgets what the topic is drink.
Trump said Biden can‚Äôt say ‚Äúlaw enforcement‚Äù or he‚Äôd lose his supporters. I want Trump to say Black Lives Matter and see how many supporters he lose.
Biden said "You need to shut up, man."  That was the only rational thing I have heard.
SPOT ON!!! Joe Biden on George Floyd.
Yes and it‚Äôs going just like I thought it would , Joe Biden is getting the baby treatment from Wallace !
If Chris Wallace wanted to be Biden's running mate, he should have had a sex change. #PresidentialDebate
Biden called Trump a clown üòÇ they could‚Äôve did this on twitter üòÇ
Biden definitely doesn‚Äôt want to talk about Hunter!
The left is falling back on how proud they are that "Biden is restrained," which tells you how badly Trump is running over him.
Trump = gun, Biden = knife #boomboom
We need somebody like an AOC to come in and light the set on fire. Biden is operating on the old rules.
Trump PLEASEEE let Biden Speak!!!
Exactly what I just told my husband ! Biden is jacked up on something!
Wonder what 'La Resistance' is gonna think about that.  They definitely will not be happy with that quote from Biden.
I think it‚Äôs clear that Biden is neither on debate-enhancing drugs nor standing there with an earpiece in. #PresidentialDebate
Biden is winning so far
So the 'Hey Fat' Biden showed up tonight.  The potential for this to be closer and or Trump losing a debate because of this was forecasted awhile back.  Will it be enough for the election?  I think not.  The riots have already decided that.
s much for the colleague and friend Wallace being invisible tonight. He‚Äôs been debating Trump and protecting Biden for 45 min.
Biden just isn't the pit bull this moment calls for.
Besides this debate being an embarrassment, Trump cannot handle Biden laughing at him. Also, quite strategic how they try to undercut each other's talking time.
Not watching this debate right now but looks like Biden wins ok take me to tomorrow oh wait it's just more Covid times
Whatever taxes Trump paid in 2016 was based on the tax policies of the Obama/Biden administration. Don't get this argument.
We all knew Trump was gonna out talk Biden because he‚Äôs has no conscious about cappin. No need to drag Biden on the TL tho. It‚Äôs not productive fam.
Mr. President  give Mr.Biden room to make his own mistakes.  Try and limit your interjections sir.
Weirdly hoping Biden rips off his jacket, loosens his tie, rolls up his sleeves and starts throwing hands. Simply because I‚Äôm certain Trump will flee.
Biden kilt me when he said this the same man said you can put bleach in your arm üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Donald is literally attacking how often Biden wears a mask... umm okay? and that‚Äôs supposed to be a bad thing??

And Biden is the former VP. Not Mr. Vice President. That‚Äôs Pence
Donald Trump is a fucking lunatic and Joe Biden gave us the slogan of 2020 with "will you shut up man".
Biden looks so much more feeble than he did four years ago. He's really aged.

In 2017, the Bidens income jumped from $396,552 to $9,578,639, according to their¬†tax return from that year ($8M from their book deal).¬†Joe and Jill Biden paid $3,742,974 in federal taxes on that income and owed the IRS $1,666 after filing their taxes, according to the return.
The Bidens paid $3.9M in 2017 off $9M in income.  Trump paid $750 dollars.... dollars!  Save your fake, misinformed rage.
If trump is as rich as he "claims" he would be 30X more rich than Biden. The Biden's paid $3.9M in taxes in 2017, Trump paid $750.
In 2017, the Bidens income was $9,578,639. Joe and Jill Biden paid $3,742,974 in federal taxes on that income and owed the IRS $1,666 after filing their taxes, according to the return.   Got any sources for your wild claims?
If you believe that Trump is as rich ad he says he is (I definitely do not), Biden is worth a fraction of what trump "claims." But I bet Biden paid more than $750 in taxes.
My sister had  brain aneurisms is like a parrot ,she will repeat same thing over &amp; over , Sad   let‚Äôs see Biden  could take steroid shot  be active &amp; speak faster   easy to spot   I really wish people would think about USA &amp; not vote 4‚Äì2 Frontal lobe brain  injury Biden  Trump üá∫üá∏

Biden could be drooling and in a hospital gown and mother would change his supporters. Ya really think this will change Trump supporters. Dream on.
WOW. Ok so he‚Äôs going to vote because after 47 years biden is now going to do something? No he‚Äôs voting for kamala harris and the extreme left she brings with her. I thought you had some common sense. No longer a fan.
This is indeed America, it means people have a right to voice their opinion on Mr. Johnson's public endorsement of Biden.  RTR
Apparently he built those things with UNTAXED MONEY FOR TWENTY YEARS and then decided to pay $750 the year he was elected! So, the question is, what did  build? A public record of tax returns, school transcripts, &amp; wd provide DNA if ordered. Next?
I pray that God will see favor over you and Kamala. Dear Mr. Biden, please lay out your platform for America once you become s President! Don‚Äôt focus on our crooked President and crooked Mitch! Please have a strong outlined platform on how you can repair the 4 years of damage.
As 47% became a significant number in 2012, $750 could become the memorable figure in this election.  But just like the ET tape, know that Trump will attack hard out the gate in this upcoming debate. Biden better be ready.
Biden is disgusting. how dare he equate Goebbels with   how low will Biden stoop
Biden‚Äôs team is hiding his decline.   that and they‚Äôre switching his days to nights in hopes that he‚Äôll do better with the debates.
So did his accusers. They all have tax attorneys/accountants who use every aspect of law to reduce tax liability. Nothing illegal. They wrote the tax code and Trump used every inch of it. Smart man! Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, Twit Jack, Pelosi, Feinstein, Schumer, Biden, OBAMA
Senate Report Accuses Hunter Biden Of Possibly Using Trafficked Hookers.  We already know he‚Äôs partial to them along with coke
You‚Äôll pay even more if ya boy Biden gets in
Agree, it‚Äôs not an ideal ticket, but we have to stop the bleeding. Dems needed someone that could win an election, and Biden offered the best chance.
None. That was my point. Look, among the Dem candidates, Biden  the best a conservative can do if they simply can‚Äôt stomach voting for Trump again.
So you are saying you would have voted for Bernie/Warren/Pete/Yang but not Biden? So many champions of small government in that group, lol. So you are sitting this one out, yes?
He‚Äôs the gift that keeps on giving.‚Å¶
Biden is just a LIAR, period
We  know that military families and vets value duty, honor, and sacrifice. It‚Äôs why such a traditionally conservative group is increasingly breaking for Biden. Join us today!
And Biden is better? He doesn't even support our military. Y'all need to wake up and realize that Biden will destroy this country.

Time for W to endorse Biden.
I totally recommend therapy! We will see how "good" Biden is once Trump embarrasses him Tuesday night...it's gonna be hillarious!
But you support Joe Biden who's mentors were members of the ku Klux Klan. To each his own.
Well that puts Joe Biden in the same position with Trump because he's also a pathological liar just look at his record and statements.
People would try and cancel Jesus if he baptized Trump!!! Enough with the foolishness I'm not going to cancel anybody because they're voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: fine, that‚Äôs easy only after you release your tax returns
great way to put it: if Dems win it will be Harris Administration with Guest Star Biden
Vote Biden for Censorship
Precisely. We have a choice between 4 more years of Trump or 8 years of Biden/Harris &amp; then 4 or 8 years of Trump 2.0. We can't wait 12 or 16 years to turn this country around. 4 more years of Trump &amp; folks will be begging for change....real change.
Trump's nomination of Barrett¬†will be a major campaign issue, coming just three days before his¬†first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
Newt Gingrich | Hunter Biden and Tuesday‚Äôs Debate | Gingrich 360.  ‚Å¶ CHRIS Wallace will you Really ask the tough questions or be complicit in Biden‚Äôs lies??
Do you think I‚Äôm some raging fucking Biden supporter the man is fucking senile but I‚Äôd rather have a fucking toaster in office than someone who is challenging the most fundamental part of our democracy the peaceful transfer of power you gave go along with you coup if you want
Oh hi Laura bunch of numbers I don‚Äôt fucking like Biden I think he‚Äôs a corporate puppet but trump is actively hinting at a coup so I think Biden is the better choice rather than the complete idiot who rubs elbows with nazis and pedos
You May get a big disappointment at debate when Chris Wallace  lets Joe skate on bad answers or fails to hit him hard like he will Trump. I‚Äôm expecting Wallace to debate Trump For Biden. What he says will cue Joe‚Äôs answers.
Better have someone at debate check Joe Biden for an earpiece! Seriously. We know HRC got ?? ahead off time  as we bet Joe does too. First time topics announced in advance. Never Trump  Chris Wallace giving Joe to me to memorize ans
Neither Biden nor Graham is not a good person.
Biden supporters actually have a heart, Trump supporters are just plain ignorant.  Vote blue! #BidenHarris2020 #DumpTrump2020 #VoteHimOut2020 #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
OK who is to pay for the Canadian Voting Machines this time, when  Biden/Obama ran once George Soros paid for them. I hear Biden been getting money from Ukraine &amp; Russia, I am guessing he already paid them but how can they arrive in the USA.
Did someone make those for Joe Biden &amp; Harris, how sweet they look together Like a TikTok ready to go BOIN hypothetically of course since its not about large breasts but rather a watch that is flying into hundreds of pieces like it has finally expended its time.
Same in Montgomery. We drove all around on Sunday and saw many Jones and Biden signs and 3 for TT. 2/3 were on the same property but perpendicular streets of a corner lot. The only Trump sign we saw was for sale in a parking lot.That is your choice....not mine!! Have fun paying all the increased taxes and enjoy Big Government and eventual socialism if Biden wins! Your choice!
Hell, no. Trump would have doubled down on the negative ads. Would anyone have been surprised?  But, Biden has taken the high road on this situation. Nobody can come back later and complain that Biden was kicking a man when he was down.
I watched her say she hopes Joe Biden ‚Äú‚Äùtakes the high road‚ÄùüòÇü§£
Not surprised Mr. Riegel, not surprised at all Cheeto's people aren't pulling their ads.  Biden's a class act and it shows

Joe Biden didn‚Äôt get exposed to the Trump contagion spray.
The first thought I had this morning after hearing the news that Trump has COVID was ‚ÄúIf he infected Joe Biden at the debate the other night, I‚Äôm going to be extra pissed!‚Äù Trump is such an incredibly horrible leader especially with the example he sets by his actions.
I‚Äôm for Biden/Harris but I hope trump &amp; Melanie are okay. I hope you and yours are okay. I hope    are okay. Y‚Äôall hang in there ‚ô•Ô∏èüá∫üá∏
OR - a zoom meeting debate where they can mute his dumbass when Biden is speaking
Focus on facts Serge. So far Biden is lying. He‚Äôs unable to lead the country. I know that and you know that. There‚Äôs no other option for the USA but Donald J Trump. Biden is a racist joke.
Replace the second presidential debate with a Joe Biden Town Hall. America will be okay with this. I certainly will be.
I could agree with that statement. But as you stated there would be a transition period for the industry with a Biden win which could last 6-12 months. A trump would be immediate rebound. Since we are talking options, I stand by my statement.
But if Biden wins, those calls will go to zero, along with XLE

Joe Biden is having a time on this train tour. Thousands of people are masked and too energized and excited to see him. üíô
From an observation: I get excited that people in their F-150s support Joe Biden. Whenever I see ppl in their pickups, I think of Donald Trump. I rode through some neighborhoods and saw these types parked in a driveway with Biden signs on their front lawn.

Give Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot a landslide victory so there will be no way for Trump to claim that he really won the election.
If Biden ain‚Äôt coming with this energy to the next debate he might as well not show up at all.

As a recovering addict myself, Joe Biden became my hero tonight when he turned to the camera &amp; said ‚Äúmy son had a drug problem, &amp; he over came it‚Äù that meant so much to me!
Biden mostly did well, but occasionally he let his mid-Atlantic upbringing get the best of him. "Shut up, man."
What she said. Voting for Biden is not a panacea, but it will at least slow the bleeding. #Debates2020
Biden after they walk out the debate #2020PresidentialDebate
Biden: "Yes. We'll count the ballots as you pointed out.... If there are thousands of ballots, we'll take the time to count them"  Trump interjects with some BS. Biden: "He has no idea what he's talking about." #Debates2020
Wallace correctly points out that the biggest problem with mail-in ballots is rejection due to improperly filled-out ballots, etc, which is correct.  Biden talks about identity verification but doesn't address incorrectly filled-out ballots. #Debates2020
Oh, I know, but let's be honest. Biden COULD use that same ammo against Trump  But she ALWAYS seems far more prepared. Plus a much better speaker...
Biden correctly says "There is no evidence of that" bullshit about unsolicited ballots and that 5 states (2 red) have been doing vote by mail for decades  #Debates2020
No one but I'm 100% certain you're boy Chris Wallace lost. He's awful. Totally in the tank for Biden. Disgraceful.
Joe Biden with the zinger.   ‚ÄúWhen all is counted and I win, it‚Äôs all over.‚Äù   Spicy Joe. üî•üî•üî•
That closing statement from Biden was üî•üî•üî•.
Biden correctly describes Trump's rhetoric as voter suppression (without using the word suppression) #Debates2020
Biden correctly points out that there's no evidence of mail-in ballots being a source of systemic fraud and that Trump does it. #Debates2020
Biden: "I can't remember which of his rants you're talking about." Wallace: "I'm having a little trouble myself."  #Debates2020
If Biden wins, XLE is going to -1000
Biden, when asked about differences in drawing a line on economy vs the planet: "He hasn't drawn a line" #Debates2020

Wallace points out Biden would limit but not abolish fracking. How long before Trump tries to claim the reverse? #Debates2020
Next time Trump interrupts, can Biden just say, "Person, woman, man, TV, camera" because this dude canNOT remember the debate rules. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020

The fact that it went to Biden‚Äôs sons... this needs to be shut down
I KNOW TRUMP AINT TALKING BOUT BIDEN‚ÄôS KIDS !!
#Debates2020 COME ON BIDEN... TELL HIM WHERE HE FAILED AT!!
Trump tries to claim Hunter was dishonorably discharged for cocaine use. Biden denies it.  #Debates2020
Wallace: "Your side agreed to it [2 minutes of uninterrupted answering]."  Biden: "He never keeps his word."  Wallace: "That was rhetorical."  #Debates2020
Biden: "Everybody in your administration who tells you the truth has a bad idea"  #Debates2020
Trump: "Almost everything I see is from the left wing"  When confronted with white supremacists, he pivots back to antifa.  Biden: "Antifa is an idea, not an organization."  #Debates2020
He hates Trump more than he cares about anything else. His hatred is deep and strong when it comes to Trump and its been evident for a while. He keeps jumping in to save Biden tonight. It's disgusting.
Wallace to Biden: have you ever called Wheeler or Brown and said you have to stop this shit in Portland?  Biden: "I don't hold public office now... the violence should be prosecuted."  #Debates2020
Trump claims Biden has no law enforcement support. "We have time." Biden: "We don't have time"  Wallace shifts to protests. #Debates2020
"What does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the #BlackLivesMatter call for community control of police?" Biden: "I'm totally opposed to defunding local police forces"  THAT is how you lose your "radical left" followers, Joe.  #Debates2020
I love Joe Biden. Yes I said it.
Biden: he wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn  #Debates2020
Wallace: "Is [the increase in violent crimes in both blue and red cities] a party issue?"  Trump: proceeds to talk only about Chicago, claims Biden will lose his "radical left supporters" and will abolish suburbs. #Debates2020
mannnn Biden has every right to go walk over to Trump and smack the taste outta him ü•±
Biden: "Law and order with justice where people are treated fairly." then points out crime stats under his administration  "Mr. President, you're going to be happy because we're going to be talking about law and order."  #Debates2020
Biden: something something unity.  Trump: there was hatred and division in the Obama administration. "Frankly it was more violent than what we're seeing now."  Biden: "This is ridiculous."  #Debates2020
Back to violence being "never appropriate"  Trump tries to bait Biden on "What is peaceful protest?"  Wallace shuts him the hell down. #Debates2020
On to Breonna Taylor. Biden says the vast majority of cops are decent people but "there are some bad apples."  HAS LITERALLY EVERYONE FORGOTTEN THE SECOND HALF OF THAT IDIOM? Those bad apples spoil the rest of them!  #Debates2020
Are Biden's meds wearing off? #Debates2020
"What he did has been disastrous for the African-American community."  Trump brings up the 1994 crime bill, saying "they've never forgotten it."  Then why did Biden clean the fuck up with Black voters in the primaries?  #Debates2020
Biden is on a roll calling out Trump's racism. #Debates2020
Biden: "We've never walked away from trying to accomplish equity for everyone."  I can think of 3/5 of a reason why that's blatantly false.  #Debates2020
Chris Wallace is on Team Biden. He hates Trump more than he loves anything.
Trump keeps interrupting Biden denying allegations of Hunter's corruptions. "He doesn't want to let me answer because he knows the truth" and points out everyone who has discredited those allegations. Trump won't shut up. #Debates2020
"He talks about the great trade deals he's done. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal."  Trump: "China ate your lunch" and brings up Hunter Biden, makes claims about Hunter's corruption, which Biden denies.  #Debates2020
Biden touts bringing back Chrysler and GM. "They're gone. He blew it."  #Debates2020
I think we know why,  ü§´ (in whisper voice) It's because Chris Wallace is on Biden's side. üòê
Trump keeps interrupting Biden. Biden lets him do it. "This guy"  #Debates2020
Biden talks about raising corporate taxes (which are much needed).  Trump: why didn't you do it when you were VP? Biden: because you did it [lowered corp taxes] as president.  #Debates2020
"The tax code that put him in a position that he pays less than a teacher...and he does take advantage of the tax system"  Trump: Why didn't you do things over the last 25 years? Biden: You kept screwing it up. "You're the worst president America has ever had." #Debates2020
Now Wallace brings up the $750. "Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?"  He dodged the question entirely.  Biden: "show us your tax returns." Trump: "You'll see them as soon as they're finished."  WTF. #Debates2020
Trump tries to claim he has a right to rebut Biden's claims. He doesn't, but Wallace lets him walk all over him anyway. MUTE HIS SORRY ASS.  "I'm the one who brought back Big Ten football."  No you weren't, shithead. #Debates2020
Biden says Trump will become the first president with fewer jobs (in the economy) compared to when he took office in American history, which... wow. #Debates2020
Biden starts off by pointing out how millionaires and billionaires have only gotten richer in the pandemic, brings up small, working class towns and the $750 tax return. Trump interrupts... again.  #Debates2020
Trump tries to claim "nobody will show up" to Biden's smaller rallies and then inflates the size of his crowds again, tries to claim "we have had no problem whatsoever" with #COVID19 at his rallies. The ghost of Herman Cain says hi. #Debates2020
Biden points out how wearing masks until January can save 100k lives. Trump tries to say Fauci discredited himself, which... what. Yes he screwed up the early messaging.  #Debates2020
Biden is saying all this stuff about Covid and PPE as if that's not already being done as much as it can be.
Trump tries to claim Biden said the name of his own college wrong. Say what?  #Debates2020
Biden is at least classy and compassionate.  Trump is a steamroller in need of a tune up.
Joe Biden is winning this y‚Äôall. He is roasting, toasting, and shitting on this MFER. He said ‚ÄúMaybe injecting bleach in your arms.‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ #BidenHarris
Wallace bringing up vaccine hesitancy and asking if Biden/Harris are contributing to it. Biden addresses it pretty well, pointing out that there are lots of private scientists not subject to Trump's muzzle. #Debates2020
Biden points out that Trump said it would be gone by Easter and by summer and we should inject bleach into our arms.   Trump tries to claim it was sarcastic.   Typical right-wing horseshit. #Debates2020
Trump claims Biden did a shitty job with #h1n1. Biden points out 14k is a hell of a lot less than 200k without a shutdown.  Biden turns to the pathos argument very well.  #Debates2020
First golf dig against Trump by Biden and it's a birdie. #Debates2020
Biden starts off by counting off all the #Debates2020  stats. "Because you are who you are."  Points out the Woodward tapes. "You don't panic. He panicked."  #Debates2020   Also points for pronouncing Xi correctly.
Trump interrupts Biden again. "Will you shut up, man?" Holy fuck, Biden.  #Debates2020
Wallace weakly tries to pivot back to SCOTUS, bringing up packing the court. "Are you willing to tell the American people whether you will support ending the filibuster or packing the court?"  Biden refuses to answer, tells people to vote now. #Debates2020
"He has no plan for health care. He sends out wishful thinking."  Accurate, Biden.  #Debates2020
Trump: "He just lost the left"  After a bit of tantrums by Trump, Biden looks at Wallace: "Do you have any idea what this clown is doing?"  Well played. #Debates2020
Wallace lobs a softball at Biden asking him to shoot down a Trump talking point that the public option would end private insurance. He hits it out of the park and Trump tries to claim that it's the same thing as #m4a.   And Trump turns around and brings up Pocahontas #Debates2020
Wallace correctly calls Trump's executive order protecting pre-existing conditions "largely symbolic."  Trump: "I guess I'm debating you."  I'm with Biden in laughing at Trump's bullshit. #Debates2020
Y‚Äôall I wanna smack Trump already damn let Biden talk
Biden when he days he is t Democratic Party
Trump's trying his interruption tactics. Biden is having none of it. #Debates2020
"The 200,000 people that have died under his watch"  Keep harping on that, Biden. #Debates2020
And Trump just called Biden a socialist. That took longer than I expected. #Debates2020
Good job by Biden to pivot to healthcare in his argument as to why confirming Barrett is bad. #debates2020
alright twitter. i need your help.  my mom said she‚Äôs not sure who to vote for in november.  i need every convincing article, stat, interview, EVERY THING you‚Äôve got to send to her to convince her to settle for biden.  idk what to do.
Trump wore those younger Republicans out in the Primaries. The DNC just picked Biden.
LOL oh so now suddenly we expect businessmen to pay more than legally obligated in taxes??? Are you serious right now? Do YOU donate to the IRS? Does ANYBODY pay more than legally required in taxes? Please find me one person who freely donates to the IRS and I will vote Biden!
I haven't live tweeted anything since my first live basketball game a few years ago. Cocktails and live-tweeting the debate tonight. "One's a senile moron who says something dumber than before. One is Joe Biden".
You mean a system made possible by representatives who have been on office for decades so they too can get away with paying next to nothing in taxes??? Like.... ohhhhh, IDK, Biden, Sanders, Clinton...
If Biden somehow wins Georgia, that has to be a symbolic game over for Trump (not a statistical one)
I don‚Äôt usually tweet about California because this is a Democratic stronghold. The last Republican to have won Cali was George H.W. Bush by double-digits in 1988. Since then, no Democrat has ever beaten a Republican in this state by 34 points. Biden could beat this man by 40.
What does Trump take to stop the tremor or to treat his weak leg? What helps him get by on 3 hours sleep so he can watch his favorite TV shows &amp; tweet. Biden looks like he‚Äôs in robust good health. Trump looks like a heart attack waiting to happen; overweight &amp; never exercises.
Hunter Biden.

Biden: C‚Äômon man, I‚Äôm gonna lay the smack down on those jabronis with the people‚Äôs elbow. Do you smell-l-l-l-l-l-l what I‚Äôm cooking?
His hardcore followers will believe Biden is doping if he doesn‚Äôt take a drug test buy who cares, they wouldn‚Äôt vote for him anyway. Doubt Trump's gambit will persuade anyone on the fence.
I will say if biden wins then it will kill the market and capital gains tax will increase heavily
2) It‚Äôs a well-known fact that Joe Biden is a devout Catholic yet Donald Trump says that Biden is against God. It‚Äôs Donald Trump who virtually never attends church and who does things every single day that are definitely not Christlike. Shame on you &amp; shame on Trump.
So a false childish attack on Biden, no legitimate argument against Biden, and more importantly a serious lack of masks showing your lack of care and caution for the people in my county.  You can stay away now.
A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I walked past a teenager in the mall who wore a Biden-Harris hat. I gave him a thumbs up. The media portrayed that Joe couldn‚Äôt appeal to young people. This video and my encounter with that boy is proof that Gen Z loves Joe."Terrible person!" says the woman who just said natural selection might take care of Joe Biden before the electionüòÜ
Take the Supreme Court win and then whatever happens, happens. If Biden wins the house most likely red waves in 2022.
If Biden is elected, how fast will #25thAmendment be used? /s
Questions will be given to Biden in advance.
This clip of Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask on Tuesday night hasn‚Äôt aged well   IRONY? KARMA? GOD WORKING IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS? YOU DECIDE.
Why would anything happen to the stock market if Biden was down. Biden knows nothing about the stock market, the economy. He can barely read

Fox News remember how you guys treated Joe Biden?
I don't think he would ever come out and say it, but I believe W &amp;  are also Biden supporters. Agree or disagree with W's policies, he loves our country and our people.
The official statement is that Trump is doing just fine. Time to ramp back up the negative ads. Biden needs to stop trying to be the nice guy. Fuck Trump.
The White House hid Trump's condition for over a day. Trump tested positive the day after the debate, and wasn't tested at the debate because he arrived late! The Biden campaign is entitled to ALL medical records on Trump at least from the past week.
Everyone out there with your #trump or #biden #covid19 conspiracies...chill out. For real, you guys are sounding like a bunch of Alex Jones copies. Is anyone sane anymore?
I think that or to delay the race...u see Biden took all his negative trump adds down. Most def playing chess
Also, blaming Biden for a thing that happened in '09 is like blaming Pence now. I guess logical consistency isn't your strong suit.  Not that I much care, I don't support Biden either.
What does being a gentleman have to do with the election of a president? If Trump was in the same position, he would give less than 2 shits if Biden lived or died. He would be moving at warp speed to try to unseat him. Amirite?ü§î
Lee Corso is the sports worlds Joe Biden
Biden‚Äôs position is whatever his handlers tell him it is
nobody:  biden: mans don't even have a dog!
Did they autopsy Biden already?
Since the Biden-Harris campaign has suspended its ads against the Trump GOP, the GOP takes it a a new path to criticizing Biden. Instead of reciprocating, the Trump's continue to attack! They know not what they have started!
A lesson in humility and not mocking BIDEN for his BIG MASK!
I hope this spreads to Biden in November.
I‚Äôm more scared of Pence being president than any stupid thing Trump does. I already cast my ballot for Joe Biden.
I highly doubt President Trump is faking the coronavirus as part of a last resort to help himself get reelected and cover up that disaster of a debate he had with former VP Biden. That said, I can't entirely rule it out due to a lack of transparency from him and the White House.
Now is NOT THE TIME TO BLINK, BIDEN. God, it‚Äôs like we don‚Äôt WANT to win this time either. Push HARDER. Double down on his illness as a consequence. Push the death tolls, lives permanently changed, economic cost. Push every fucking policy failure in his face and down his throat.
I am seeing this the past month of so throughout the south. Also rooms are increasing price ( demand) absolutely opposite of economic forces! I see hundreds/ thousands of Trump stuff- very little Biden. Other night in a 4 star was like staying at a frat house. Someone is funding
No retreat! It's America or trump - Biden must fight for America. #TrumpIsATraitor would fight for himself.  Different times, different place - different rules for a different race.
He won‚Äôt even take them down in response to Biden taking his down

Top story: Has Elissa Slotkin Detected Early Hints of a Biden Blowout? - POLITICO  see more
Nope. He chose optics over safety, even making fun of Biden at the debate for the size of the mask he wore. If the shoe was on the other foot, I doubt Trump would send him a case of bottled water &amp; a bottle of Advil. The game is the game &amp; he knows that. #TinyHandRhetoric
If you ever started a sentence without either the word Democrats, Biden or ‚ÄúI‚Äù I‚Äôd probably have a heart attack
I'm not surprised personally Democrats believe every word Joe Biden and Liberal Media outlet's say.
Pretending I said anything about contagions being "easily arrested" or the flu being "contained" seems like an exhausting exercise in goalpost moving, Joe.  Also, bold of you to assume I support Biden just because Trump and his anti-intellectualist lackeys disgust me.
Trump would dog walk Biden with negative ads if he got sick
He didn‚Äôt listen to the science last week when he mocked Biden for wearing a mask &amp; boasted about his rallies and their ‚Äúsafety‚Äù. His children didn‚Äôt listen to science when they all refused to wear masks at the debate. Now several WH reporters are testing positive...
Yes me too. We need him well for his court day when biden takes over.
Funny you put  ‚Äúnever forget‚Äù and ‚Äúalways remember‚Äù in the same sentence with Joe Biden...the ironyü§£
yes racism does motivate me to vote. That‚Äôs why we vote Trump. How the hell do you look over Biden‚Äôs entire racist history dating back as far as the 70‚Äôs... seriously. They get blacks every time playing on heart strings. And do nothing once elected.
You are a true warrior and president pence may mention you when he pardon Trump before biden takes office.

BREAKING: Biden negative
imagine if it was joe biden that got covid...   would wishing death on him be accepted, oh no.  then why is okay to do it to trump.  i've never been more disgusted by democrats, y'all should be fucking ashamed of yourselves.
Re-upping, for obvious reasons:   From August. More to come.....
I‚Äôm thinking the Biden team is kicking themselves for not thinking of it first...  perfect excuse to not have a debate.  Plus gets the sympathy of fans and, like you said, destroys the narrative.
If he gave Biden COVID after Biden‚Äôs been careful and responsible the rage will be REAL.
I get you don't like him,  I don't like Biden but I would never wish anyone Ill will... You need to think about karma never know who it will get back at
See, all the lefties who for the past few days have been nasty while accusing me of secretly being in the tank for Trump are now silent, rather than saying they were wrong.
1) Politics is tit for tat (u know).Dems call down Trump for racism, so make Biden have to explain about Byrd.Both are absurd, but if you don't, the other side wins the new cycle (and the election). BTW, I wasn't specifically referring to Byrd.
I respect Mr. Biden's stance, but I also understand why people are outraged with Trump.

We watched the debate. Biden did begin the interruption process with the first question. Wallace didn't comment until Trump began interrupting. Read the transcript.

While an administrative discharge is less serious than a court martial; the repercussions can still have consequences concerning employment, veterans benefits and social standing. It allows the Navy, in Biden‚Äôs case, to ‚Äúfire‚Äù someone who does not represent good character.

Come on #chriswallace....are you serious? You softballed biden 95% of the and stood in Trump's face over white supremacists. When buden said, "No! I won't answer the question!" Why didn't you press him on packing the court????
And Biden says voter fraud isn't happening.
Love your honest reporting but Fox News and some of your fellow anchors have sold we conservatives out. Chris Wallace was totally bias against the President and covering for Biden he let it be known last night that he‚Äôs very liberal left in that joke of a debate
No way would I ever vote for Biden. Vote for Harris???? I think my grandma shit her out in the outhouse.
I love Fox news but very disappointed in Chris Wallace behavior during the debate he was disrespectful to President Trump never letting him finish  but allowing Joe Biden to say anything true or false I truly felt like I was watching President Trump debate both Wallace &amp; Biden
The FBI said it was an idea not an organization! So point Biden for listening to our FBI
I liked when Biden told trump, no green deal, then was beginning to tell Wallace how good the green deal was, Wallace helped him recover, and get back on track
It's kind of a variation on "But-What-About-Abortion!" Push pedo conspiracy theories, and at the center of it all is HRC, Biden, etc, and Trump is a white knight fighting a secret war against them to save the kids. In other words, a trumped-up reason never to vote for Democrats.

And Biden is friends with members of the KKK and didn‚Äôt denounce Antifa or BLM for all there destruction to black people. SO COME ON MAN
If they close down POTUS‚Äôs microphone when he counters back, it should be MANDATORY for them to scan Biden for wires üò°
Ask Biden to denounce Antifa with the same tenacity.  Trump has condemned about a hundred times over 4 years and you keep bringing it back. So we don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre tired of it.
Why do liberals do this? Why lie to yourselves? You see Trump shows up on 24 hours notice and attracts 25k-35k and Biden couldn‚Äôt draw 2k before the pandemic.

Biden didn‚Äôt wear a wire but Trump did. You could tell that he was listening to someone
This was on FULL display throughout  last night‚Äôs debate. Trump was belligerently defensive, condescending and callous when he was critiqued either by Biden or Chris Wallace.
Hey Trump... Biden doesn‚Äôt have big rallies because he actually CARES about Americans, not because no one shows.   WE CARE about America &amp; our fellow Americans. We. Want. Better.   Build. Back. Better.
"Joe Biden did not wear a wire to aid him in the debate, Lead Stories and PolitiFact confirm"
Watching Biden speak on FOX News. He‚Äôs rambling on as usual. Sad. Think he had an earpiece to keep him on task at the debate- oh and he had Wallace to help.
A little unsolicited advice for Joe Biden... DON‚ÄôT GET SUCKED INTO HIS CHILDISH BEHAVIOR.   As hard as it is to hear, if you let the petulant child speak, he is his own worst enemy.

President Trump had to debate Wallace and Biden. And by the way Biden did not have any good points. Every time the president tried to refute Biden‚Äòs lies, Wallace would cut him off and say sir you‚Äôve had your time. What a bunch of BS

Biden smoked Trump‚Äôs ass in the debate last night. We, the People, have had enough!!!
Biden said the Moscow Payments were "debunked?" How did someone debunk this? Do you know the fact checking organization that debunks US Homeland Security? It's called IDBISID which stands for "It's Debunked Because I Say It's Debunked" #IDBISID
Biden wore a wire...this explains a lot.         #FoxFakeNews
Let Trump talk until he actually sounds so stupid, Biden would have all 538 electoral college votes.
The Biden campaign broke its single-hour fundraising record during the debate, raising $3.8 million between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., the campaign says.
I love that Biden didn‚Äôt dance around it. He was honest.  I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall will be working TOGETHER for the best solution.
America is literally dying under Trump. Of course Biden is better.
I believe Biden had some sort of listening device. He kept jotting notes.....then read them. Someone feeding him info.
I get sick of Biden bringing up his family tragedies.  Feels dirty after the 10,000 time.  Lip quiver and everything.

You're simply suffering that dreaded TDS.  Trump moved immediately to ban China travel, while Biden called him Xenophobic!  Please do your homework.  Trump saved lives!
I think if Fox had a true moderator last night, things might have gone better. Chris Wallace was battling Trump. Was gentle with Biden. Trump was debating two people last night, not one. Will never again watch Chris Wallace.
Was Biden President for 47 years? Wow. I had no idea. I thought he was just a Congressman with a single vote and a VP with no vote, but hey, you‚Äôre the expert. #GOPComplicitTraitors
Hey could Biden have used the word xenophobic because Trump called it the ‚ÄúChinese Virus‚Äù?  Just a thought.
Joe Biden is running for President.  He should be able to handle the pressure.  If he can't, there's no use in him running.   Last night showed he is weak.   I could care less about his "feels".
Well let‚Äôs see, where did Biden get that from? Did he make it up? Nooooo....he didn‚Äôt did he?
TRUMP!!!  EVEN THOUGH HE INTERRUPTED numerous times.  Biden was ridiculous, obviously, unprepared.
What the hell you talking about?  Where is Hunter Biden?  #Trump2020 #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
At this point it‚Äôs perfectly clear. If you support Donald Trump, you support white supremacy. #shutupman #Clown #Biden
Perfect, this shows just how STUPID these people are!  Let me guess, they are voting for Biden.  Dumb and Dumber!!
Trump said last night ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wrong‚Äù when Biden pointed this very thing out. Trump knows more about national security threats than his own FBI Director, apparently.
I just feel like you could replace either one of the candidates with John Addams in the scene...  President Donald Trump... good luck  President Joe Biden... good luck   üòÖ
Every psychologist in America freaked out when Joe Biden said police should call psychologist whenever people are not cooperating instead of using force... Just imagine being a psychologist and having to pull up to an active crime scene that is extremely dangerous. Biden202 üòÇüòÇ
We can never apologize enough, but I am sorry. I am voting for Biden.
Biden absolutely got demolished last night. Couldnt provide any numbers or facts to what he said, dodged every question, and could only respond with "will you just shut up manüò§" üòÇ
I agree. Trump did nothing to reverse the trajectory of the race, and he was so belligerent that even when Biden lost his cool he came off as being more likeable. After all, what American watching last night didn't want to tell Trump to STFU?
Trump is frustrating af but I won‚Äôt say Biden is scared üòÇ
VOTE RED üü• 2020 Biden = Globalism/Communism  Trump = America/Freedom üòé
Did Chris Wallace replace Biden as the Democrat nominee?
I don‚Äôt think there are many people out there that care about Hunter Biden.  I don‚Äôt understand the President‚Äôs fixation.  Hunter Biden isn‚Äôt running for President.
This moment stood out to me. Biden talking about his dead son and Trump interrupting him to insult his living son who is a recovering drug addict. Trump is a moral monster.
Why did #ChrisWallace give Biden the answers? It‚Äôs clear he did because Biden would look down and read the answer off. Wallace would cut Trumps time but give Biden the full 2 mins. Done with Fox and Wallace.
He proved us right. He‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. He did give Biden the questions in advance. Otherwise after the 2nd question was asked Biden wouldn‚Äôt have looked down and started reading from his notes.
The Unions are much better these days with WORK. The Blue Collar Dems have moved on from O Biden
President Trump gave Middle Class TAX breaks. We received twice income tax return refund then We ever did with O Biden.
Trump and Biden discussed the Green New Deal, Critical Race Theory, law and order, health care, and more in the debate.  via
Biden‚Äôs handlers you mean. He is a feeble old man. He doesn‚Äôt control crap he is led around.
Whatcha hidin' Biden?
Someone from my high school ‚Äú if you vote for Biden you‚Äôre stupid as crap. He doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing ‚Äú mhmmmüåö
Did you tell him that‚Äôs what that Biden guy on stage is son?
All jokes aside, Biden sticking up for his son despite his struggle with drugs is pretty admirable. That‚Äôs a father who loves his kid. Compare that to a man who once said if his daughter wasn‚Äôt his, he would date her ü•¥ü•¥
Debate Takeaways: Stark differences between Trump, Biden
Given the circumstances in tonight's hellacious debate, Biden did better than Trump. I'm hoping Biden can improve on the next 2 debates in regards to him not letting Trump's antics get him off base. Trump badly needs a teleprompter and his aides to help him not get too hot.
I don‚Äôt fw Biden. Trump is just dumb as fuck lmao
And Trump wouldn‚Äôt shut up for Biden to hang himself! They all 3 sucked but the activist pundits and press on both sides will spin it as a win! So what
It was a 2 on 1 debate Wallace kept interrupting Trump while carrying Biden's water. #Trump2020 #4moreyears #votered #backtheblue
Y'all are gonna have to except your dear leader, like Biden said isn't smart enuf to debate the facts. We're gonna have to start a trump rehab for you people. Country before party. Period.
Biden is China.üò¨
If you debate in high school, &amp; it is my turn to speak, the opposition is not allowed to talk until I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm baffled people are taking Trump not letting Biden speak, interrupting him constantly, &amp; moderator asking him to stop as ‚Äúhe‚Äôs biased‚Äù is so ridiculous.
Please some of you big accounts, look at the last few minutes post debate. Biden is with Chris Wallace, a female aid goes to Bidens podium and removes a tablet, Biden was reading from real-time. You can see him reading and speaking, especially when quoting numbers
Lmao biden not winning
ngl Chris Wallace did everything he could to help Biden in that debate and that was still a poor showing
Fact Check: Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Biden repeats Charlottesville lie to slam Trump | News Break
Bet the progressives were mad at Biden tonight
Biden‚Äôs strategy was to let Trump babble and bully himself into a corner. When Biden actually spoke, he was clear and concise, contrary to what others said he would do. Trump was word vomit, Biden was prepared with facts.

I vote every year bro but biden now winning the electoral college he can get the popular vote all day
Joe Biden wants to open our borders and give Illegal Immigrants FREE HEALTHCARE THAT WE AS AMERICANS PAY FOR... Nah mayne... That‚Äôs not cool at all... Why should money that I make go to people who aren‚Äôt even a citizen?
Biden is the guy who cleans the blood and guts off of the gladiator‚Äôs weapons and then goes home to eat his porridge.
because Biden is a liar
No, Biden was afraid of his party! Take off your blinders!
Well...that debate was embarassing. I mean it seems to me the only question is do you want to lose half your friends and family or will you vote for Biden.  #PresidentialDebate2020
Hunter Biden must be from mobile üëÄ
I choose to believe Joe Biden has dementia. I also believe it's pitiful the way his own family and political party are using him.
Wallace Lost; the President who should have ‚Äúsome‚Äù latitude was continually cut off in mid sentence; fair and balanced my butt; Biden had the answers, obviously; Biden reading the questions while the question was asked;  rewind it, so obvious!
Sorry, I was being sarcastic  Biden would not gain from actually helping people, only the people he claim to care about
Biden is done debating. This was a one time deal.
And/or those who are sick of the constant lying and chaos  The more I think about it the better I think Biden fared. And you‚Äôd have to imagine next debate will be more effectively moderated- hopefully undecided voters keep tuning in
Report: Biden Reneges, Now Won't Submit to Search for Earpiece Before Debate via
Haha hahahahahaha what a sad little bubble you live in my friend. Biden has made his denouncing of rioting and looting into an entire ad campaign. Keep the fuck up
Specially since Biden likely prepped with Chris Wallace..
Biden‚Äôs football locker room talk isn‚Äôt getting the job done!
You forgot to mention, Biden also did the Hillary laugh. Laughing at our President while speaking is NOT a good look.
This debate was the most immature display of Biden's testosterone .
Donald Trump is a blood and guts sucking agitator. Joe Biden is an inspired, bold, just (servant of the American people)
Ari, Wallace didn‚Äôt allow the President to rebuke Biden‚Äôs idiotic thoughts; he was very effective and then Wallace would cut him off!! Wallace D-
What is bizarre? The first sentence is almost undeniable. The second tracks the facts very, very closely, if you pay attention to the facts. See Politico's "Biden Inc" story. Politico leans LEFT, but they told it straight.
I want us to all see Joe, Jill, and Hunter Biden 's tax returns.
I'm anti-Trump and anti-Biden. Or, rather, I'm for certain principles, and hole all sides to those principles equally. I have praised both Trump and Biden for various things, but blasted both of them a whole lot more. With either as president, the nation loses.
I thought at one point Chris Wallace would pause and go spoon feed Joe Biden his nursing home pudding. #ChrisWallaceSucks
How five members of Joe Biden‚Äôs family got rich through his connections
Absolutely! His body language with Biden made it obvious.
All Biden did was repeat liberal media talking points - he did not ask a single question that he actual thought of . Nor did he discuss anything he would do , he only critiqued the president ..
üòÜüòÜü§£CNN show of hands.  (The three behind her didn‚Äôt raise their hand for Bidenüòâ)
Biden's refusal 2 take a stand on the question of court packing is pure, unadulterated cowardice. Unacceptable. And his long, long softness toward China, combined with Hunter's multiple business deals w/China, are a serious concern, almost as serious as Trump's kowtowing 2 Putin.
I have no idea to whom you are speaking. Neither Andy nor I is committed to voting for Biden. I sure as hell am not voting for him.
and that Biden believes Antifa is an idea
The Midwest just leaned towards Trump. 1. Lockdowns  2. Jobs 3. Law and Order  Biden can‚Äôt win on these.
This is a joke white? Biden wiped his ass with trump tonight
He literally attacked Trump more than Biden. It will go down as the worst moment of his career.
Lyin Biden wouldn't answer this question... I think we know were he stands.
That‚Äôs an important point for all of Trumps flaws, he is what he appears to be. Biden comes off as a phony politician that thinks we are all stupid.
Joe Biden wasn't slurrying or stuttering his words...dude kept trying to get his thoughts together because of the giant man child kept attacking and speak over everybody...that mf threw me off so bad
Biden also
Wasn't the Dow around 8000 when Trump won the election? And now it's around 26000 after all the shut down sh*t?? That's because of Biden?? Give me a break.
Biden lied
Seriously, how in the fuck did you watch the debate and conclude Trump and Biden are EQUALLY as bad? What fucking debate were you watching?
I was just waiting for Biden to say ‚ÄúNa na boo boo, stick your head in doo doo.‚Äù
The point is he was discharged from service, that Biden refuted, then received LOTS of money for his board seat at Burisma, which Biden also refuted.
biden telling trump to shut up was amazing thank u
Trump beat Biden and Wallace!
The point is to get that fucking clown out of office? Do I think Biden is a great candidate? HELL NO but he‚Äôs a fuck ton of a lot better than whatever the hell is in there now
Joe Biden is Carole baskin
It was as if Chris Wallace and Biden practiced together ahead of time.
"Shut up, man." = Shut up, ignorant idiot --
I'm glad Biden called out all the dog whistles, but it's very apparent Nov 3 is going to be violent and the aftermath may be worse.
Joe Biden is receiving answers through his Esteem hearing implant. He touches his pocket to activate it and looks down because he needs to concentrate on what he is being told through it.If you watch him closely you can see it every time.
When Biden called him a clown I almost lost it üòÇ
The first debate between President  and Joe Biden is over. Who do you think won?  #Debates2020¬†¬†#alpolitics
Did Biden miss opportunities to challenge the President? Yes. But Chris Wallace did a decent job of checking the President so that Biden didn‚Äôt have to. I think overall Biden will get a boost in the polls from women and independent voters just from the president‚Äôs attitude.
True. Biden won by standing there and saying nothing.  did more damage to himself than Biden ever could!
I had already decided that I was voting for Biden but having to face time my family so that they could say goodbye to their dying father/husband made my passion to get trump out even stronger.
Biggest thing I got. Biden says all the stuff about Hunter and Jim Biden is debunked. Well Trumps collusion has been debunked why haven‚Äôt they let that go.
After det debate I‚Äôll take Biden cause either way they both a racist
Donald Trump wasn't give a chance to denounce white supremacist bc Joe Biden and Chris Wallace interrupted him and then Chris changed the topic. So how was he going to be able to. I haven't seen jim crow Joe denounce antifa or any Democrat for that matter.
Joe Biden should have walked onto that stage, disregarded every question posed to him and used each of his 2 minute segments to point out 1). Trump lies, 2). Trump's incompetence, 3). $750 federal tax payment and 4). 5 things his administration plans to do and then walked TF off!
Okay, maybe I don't.  What I do understand is how two messages directly contradict each other.  Biden stumbled hard on this one. All he had to do was discuss his efforts with AOC/his task force.  But he didn't.
Bully Trump. Constantly going after Biden about stupid stuff, had nothing 2 do with the questions. Asked him "would condemn the White Supremacists &amp; KKK". He refused, he ignored the question, but said,"I urge my followers 2 show up  polls &amp; stand by".That is scary!
everyone knows trumps position and as for biden's position it's whatever his handlers want it to be and that's why trump was so hard hitting on biden and why biden kept fumbling on his talking points and why the moderator had to constantly step in and cover for his ass
Who cares!!?? Did Biden‚Äôs taxes mention his corruption with son, Hunter!?!  #BidenCorruption #BidenCrimeFamily #Trump2020 #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica #TrumpLandslide2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory
You mean the Trump vs Wallace and Biden?
Maybe I‚Äôm cynical but I feel like that performance rallies Trump‚Äôs base and didn‚Äôt make anyone want to vote for Biden. So I would say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwin‚Äù for Trump. But what do I know?
Biden is a patriot
Wallace was Not impartial. It was Trump arguing with Biden and Wallace. Poor moderator. Overall I‚Äôd say Trump. But it wasn‚Äôt really a debate at all. Sad to see.
Damn right he is, and did anyone else see Biden funky go get a tablet off his podium post debate. Looked like he was reading a lot
This didn't help Trump. I don't think it helped Biden much...No one who had their mind made up changed it based on that...but I'm pretty damn sure Trump didn't bring anyone new into the tent, and I don't think he turned anyone off voting Biden.
Dear Mr. Biden, please DO NOT concede on Election Day or Election Night, November 3, 2020 until ALL of the votes in USA are counted!Trump starts getting half a million likes, and Biden pumps out his bots. Look at these profiles üòÇ
To the asshole who stole the Biden/Harris Sticker and Doug Jones Magnet off my car,  First of all, FUCK YOU. Secondly, I will now be making donations to both campaigns so jokes on you:
If you support Biden, you don‚Äôt care about black lives either.
Trump would've doubled the negative ads because he has No positive ads. Joe Biden cares.
Let's Not forget the millions who've lost access to health care.  Also don't forget that Trump is Actively in court now trying to take away Obamacare from millions more.  And Trump STILL doesn't have a health care plan. Joe Biden has already done the plan. Vote Biden
It's time to get some adults back in the White House.  Vote Biden
Biden appealing to dog lovers with a recent ad.
I think there is a difference between wishing him harm (which is what I‚Äôd suspect he would do if Biden were sick) and feeling bad for him. I don‚Äôt think we should wish him harm, but I am not going to feel bad when he got it do to his own negligence and has consciously spread it
And where did this Doogie Housier get his degree.  One of Trump's many Suck Ups Still trying to convince Americans to Drink the Kool-aid. Who does Americans trust.? We will vote Biden.
Where are these ppl that are going to vote for Biden? They def don't show up at events anywhere. Not big numbers on his Twitter.  I mean...you are clearly delusional. You know how numbers work, correct? 27.1 m views... Biden and Harris couldn't do that in a month.  One (1) tweet
Can you tell me if Biden who used the N-word, voting against busing: Per chameleon, friend to KKK Grand Dragon, passed oppressive prison law, has he been asked about repudiating this? Who has been the true racist?
I would not be surprised if Pres. Trump knew he was positive for Covid 19 at the debate and that he hoped that he, or someone with him, would give VP Biden Covid 19 also.
I agree with everything except the first one. üòÇ And I don't even like Biden, but yes, I'd love to see Cheeto's face.
Thankfully Biden tested negative.
The difference in leadership is very clear.  I like presidents who don't get the virus vote Biden for real leadership.
Christmas came early.  Trump's leadership during this covid crisis is the reason Americans will vote Joe Biden in a BLUE landslide.
Trump should enjoy his hospital stay,  unlike the millions of people who don't have health insurance.  Americans are voting to give you a nice long sick leave. We like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden
Joe Biden is an example of what a real president Should be.  The choice is so clear about who is Best to lead our country. I like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden.
Time for Trump to take a Permanent Sick Leave.  Americans need a real leader.  Not a game show host. America needs Joe Biden, a leader who cares.
His health problems have underscored the reasons why he was such a poor choice for America.  This is what happens when you elect a game show host to run the most powerful country in the world.  Americans will now repeat those words "Your Fired". Time for Experience.  Vote Biden
I don't know who's running the country but I Do Know who Shouldn't be.  NOT Trump.  He couldn't even protect himself from the virus and he definitely has Not protected America.  I like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden
Isn‚Äôt it weird how mean hostile press people closest 2Trump got sick with covid beforeTrump? Were they sprayed with the covid?Its just weird how it‚Äôs Republicans that are positive&amp; Pelosi scurries away&amp;now Biden&amp;Obama are being so nice &amp;magnanimous?It‚Äôs really weird&amp;I Pray4 Trump
Joe Biden is nothing more than a MEAT PUPPET for the new, radical left -
RUSH: They like Biden, they say; they don't like Trump. But then when you ask 'em, "Well, who's gonna win?" by 56 to 40, they think Trump.
I‚Äôm praying right now for your dad. Wishing you and your family peace and good health, Falesha. Vote. Fight. Biden.
Biden attacks him about his handling of covid and his full staff could be in the ICU tomorrow . Biden needs to back off and see if he will need treatment soon.
Because Biden‚Äôs team could have an outbreak tomorrow . The virus doesn‚Äôt give a damn about politics .
Trump would have said Biden died in his basement .
Trump just a few days ago mocked Biden wearing a mask .
The ‚Äúcages‚Äù were built by the Obama/Biden administration...strange how there was no public outrage about ‚Äúkids in cages‚Äù ‚Äòtil Trump became POTUS. What‚Äôs a better idea to keep 1,000‚Äôs of unexpected unaccompanied minors safe?
That‚Äôs an assumption. We truly don‚Äôt know what he would do and to say otherwise just shows bias. Biden did the right thing.

biden doesent go anywhere r do anything ! Of course he hasnt caught it YET!
Trump promised an October Surprise.  So SURPRISE! Can't wait to see the November Surprise that Joe Biden has in mind.  Voting Biden
I could see this going one of two ways: people don‚Äôt really care about Pence the way they do Trump/don‚Äôt have confidence in him, so Biden wins. Or people feel a ton of sympathy and vote Pence.
We Must also hold Trump accountable for continuing to ignore CDC guidelines.  And we Will hold him accountable this November.  Voting Biden
Let's All stay Angry together and #VoteHimOut. I've lost count of all the many ways Trump and his family have destroyed our country.  Voting Biden.

Why don‚Äôt you worry about yours? I‚Äôm a great father. Why don‚Äôt you ask yours not to vote for Biden? I‚Äôd hate  for them to live with socialism.
They should all resign (include Trump) for not alerting the Biden campaign.
I think you are underestimating the apathy of ALL moderates toward Biden, regardless of how they feel about Trump.
Maybe so. But don‚Äôt kid yourself, you‚Äôd vote for Biden under the same conditions.
Biden lies all over the stage in the debate, but that‚Äôs fine right?
Hate to break it to you (or myself) but Biden is about to lose the most lopsided election in modern history.  Trying to beat a racist with a racist and a VP who has spent her career oppressing her own race is never gonna work.
Imagine what it wouldv'e been if he would've kept the boarders opened like The Dumb Dems &amp; Biden wanted what 2.5 Million maybe ?? Think before you post your shit for brains is showing
For those arguing that Biden has done nothing in 47 years, he's a list of sponsored bills just from 2007-2009.

BREAKING: Joe and Jill Biden have tested NEGATIVE for the coronavirus, per wire reports.
thank you mr. vice president biden for encouraging people to be empathetic even if you hate trump. idc if this tweet is just a political stunt, at least he can humble himself enough to recognize it peacefully
Be well Mr Biden .
Not unless we all lose the use of our brains.  I like Presidents who don't get the Virus.  Vote Biden.
Vice President Biden was just tested for Covid-19 and is now awaiting his results, per the wire.
Joe Biden must continue to get the message out. We Only have days until the election.  We want Biden to win by a landslide.  It's Trump's own fault that he got the virus that he's downplayed since February. #VoteHimOut
Democrats too nice if Biden was sick, 45 would clown him for precautions he had taken.
Joe Biden to be tested for COVID after President Donald Trump reports positive result
As long as he isn't Dead. We VOTE.  We Desperately need Biden.
Biden is now a putin puppet
Because Trump's a very Selfish human being.  He only cares about his own needs. His refusal to Wear Masks and No Social Distancing. Voting Biden. The man with a plan.
‚ÄúTrump got it and beat it‚Äù is the spin now ? Not trump recklessly hardly ever wore a mask and mocked Biden for wearing one ?
Well Biden does that to all the girls/women. No matter the age. Sometimes he throws in a sniff.
Maybe you just saw this notice too‚Äîassume they‚Äôll redo testing in the coming day(s) as well, to confirm. So fingers crossed for Biden..., let alone all the others who unknowingly were in a risky position.
Wow! If only there was something that could have prevented Trump from catching the virus.  Oh, there was.  CDC Recommended Wearing MASKS,  and Social Distancing. Maybe Joe Biden was right for Wearing his Mask.
No I don't believe you understood. You just want to deny it. Biden is a do-nothing politician that's had a lot of practice.
Every democratic nominee. Joe Biden, Obama, Kerry, Clinton. What are you even talking about?
Trump tested positive for COVID &amp; he was at the debate clowning Biden for wearing a mask... see God don‚Äôt like ugly. I have to laugh
Everyone is stuck on Trump saying ‚Äúsure‚Äù to a question he‚Äôs been asked hundreds of times. Why aren‚Äôt we wondering why Biden wouldn‚Äôt answer questions about packing the court or eliminating the filibuster?? We‚Äôre asking the wrong questions people.
Yes, but if it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs the worst timing bc he could have given it to Biden. And what happens if either or both are hospitalized with vent or worse before 11/3 or after before votes are counted?
He never called it a hoax!!
He never called the virus a hoax...and it has indeed been used to expand gov‚Äôt power (literally shutting down our economy, schools, sports, churches, all recreational activities) &amp; isolating old/sick people from their families since March!
Even  calls Biden‚Äôs accusation that Trump called it a hoax ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù.
Biden‚Äôs not acting President until Trump invokes the 25th... which would probably depend on his symptoms. That being said if he‚Äôs asymptotic I think it‚Äôs capable for him to act as POTUS from quarantine via webcam considering that‚Äôs how most of the country works now
WAIT WHAT THE FUCK I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE JOKING  Ohhh noooo well it looks like he can't be president! That's just so very unfortunate! Well looks like Joe Biden wins, right? Heheh #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCovid

Not becoming a Biden Guy here but you have to admit the whistlestop tour whips
Now do Biden, the Dems... waiting...
That‚Äôs fair, I really don‚Äôt know. I think we can all agree that, at the very least, for decades he‚Äôs been using the system to his advantage. During those same decades, Biden was helping craft that exact system.
Vote Biden for a real president not some clown who plays one on TV. Biden actually pays his taxes and supports the military.  As a  military mom, this is what's important to me.
#BreakingNews The #Biden campaign already called a lid for tomorrow. He‚Äôs tired
Any way someone could post some solid material referencing their conduct and actual crimes?  I looked and couldn't come up with any.  I've heard some but just not sure it's fact or talk.  Biden called Antifa an idea?.. Ideas don't take over cities and burn shit down.
Or lack of action, all 47 years in Biden's case.
Watch Brenden Dilley's broadcast: Debate Hangover, Biden Exposed and More! W/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Did you not hear Biden say that he was raising taxes? Ending the tax breaks families got under Trump.
Left will not convince 2/3 of Senate to ditch filibuster. No seats stolen just because it didn't go your way. Trump is correct, he's president for a 4 year term, not 3.5. Could be 8 years if more republicans get out and vote. No way Biden gets more people to vote than Clinton.
And that's why Biden and his associates are the ones suggesting they should try to overturn an election result if they suspect it "might" be fraudulent, and actively trying to sabotage the postal service so that mail-in ballots don't arrive on time  Oh wait...

You are so wrong. 47 years in politics. VP for 8 years. Why are y'all so optimistic about Biden. I understand the Trump hate but cannot grasp why Biden is the answer. The dude is a typical politician. They care not for us peons.
I wonder how much more üí∞ the Democrats will raise after the next debate? Trump has really been great for our fundraising.  Vote Biden
And yet Trump doesn't care.  As long as he can get anyone to show up for the Trump Show, he's happy.  He doesn't care about the millions who've caught the virus or the  200,000 who have died. Time for a change.  Biden cares about all of us.  Vote Biden.
Biden needs to insist on change.  If Trump doesn't agree,  let him stay home and tweet.  Joe Biden is the best man for the job.  If we all vote,  Biden will win by a landslide but he can't win without us doing our part.
Among other benefits, it will be very nice not to have to sit through another Kayleigh McEnany press briefing after Joe Biden takes office on January 20, 2021.
Please tell me that are voting for Biden.

He was asked to condemn white people, not Biden's old buddy Robert Byrd.
After your performance in the first debate I figured you would back out of the next two. But hey it‚Äôs cool, don‚Äôt come to the debates, that‚Äôll just give Biden 90 uninterrupted minutes of prime time TV to talk directly to the America public.
All taken out of context. How about Biden voting for segregation and against busing: Cameleon said that. he eulogized a grand dragon of the KKK.. do I need to on? . tit-for-tat,,, right
Just press the Biden/Harris the same and we would see that they are fair... They ask them and let them answer without aggressive follow up and challenge. Joe's racist voting past is never asked about.
Biden deflects yet again on court packing questions: 'I'm not going to play Trump's game'  #FoxNews
. TRUMP in MINNESOTA: ‚ÄòBiden Will Turn Your State into a Refugee Camp‚Äô
Maybe you should have sent this to Obama,  Biden, Dema, and swamp creatures... If you watch the debate you will notice Biden interrupted first
Your step-son just called Joe Biden‚Äôs son a ‚Äúcrackhead‚Äù on television and your husband attacked Joe Biden‚Äôs son for having substance abuse problems in the past.   This is outrageous
If you call what the Dems, Obama, Biden, and other swamp creatures did to the Trump transition team, them I got a great lot for you at the beach... Just have to wait for the tide to go out to show it to you.
NO MORE DEBATES.  Americans are sick and tired of watching the Trump Show.  Biden doesn't need this to reach voters.  Trump needs and wants this because he only reaches his base at his rallies.  #VoteHimOut
Chaotic Trump-Biden debate results in commission making changes 'to maintain order‚Äô for next round
The General said it Best.  You can Trust Joe Biden.  America agrees. Predictions for big Blue Wave for November election which is Already underway.
NO MORE DEBATES! I can't sit through another "Shit Show" staring Trump. No benefit for Americans.  Biden doesn't need these DEBATES. Americans already support Biden as being what we need.  Trump needs these DEBATES.  #VoteHimOut
I wondered more than once,  why didn't Wallace just Stop the debate.  Remember what our parents would say when we acted up during a car trip? 'If you don't behave,  I'll turn this car around ".  We should end the debates. Americans ready to vote Biden.
Not surprisingly Trump  doesn't Know Much about ANYTHING.  This is why Americans are going to elect someone who Does Know what's going on. So sad about Trump's memory loss. Let's elect Biden.  Now Trump can get all the medical care he needs.  #VoteHimOut
CNN Tries To Shut Down Trump Spokesman For Noting That Biden Spoke At The Funeral Of Robert "KKK" Byrd

You don‚Äôt know the first thing about either of Dr. Biden‚Äôs marriages. I can‚Äôt believe you were ever a professional. She earned her doctorate thru years of work, work put on the back burner because she chose to first raise her three kids. You denigrate other women, how sad.

biden doesent know how to pump his own gas ! Trump 2020 and 2024!
Biden won that debate w/o question but Trump's childish and derange behavior made that a shitty debate. One person acted like an adult the other(meaning Trump) acted like a spoiled,egoistic brat! I want a president that act like an adult and not a derange clown! #VoteTrumpOut

who cares what biden says? why is it so important to him to have mail in ballots? CHEATING! biden knows thats his only chance ! Trump 2020 and 2024!
chris wallace should be fired ! he didnt do his job ! he was debating Trump while biden was rambling jibberish! I hope everyone who works for fox doesent do their job like wallace the clown!
I know right ! Biden and wallace had free reign while our Great President had to debate both of the cuckoos while they talked over him with gibberish! Trump 2020 and 2024!
Biden is one dumb clown!
It would be so funny if Biden‚Äôs face started turning orange!
Thanks for writing this. I have a few 24 hours. I wish my mom supported me like Joe Biden stood up for Hunter last night. Gave me hope.  Good boundaries make good relationships. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Sometimes goodbye is peace of mind.

in his administration that Antifa is leading, organizing and funding acts of violence in cities across the country from a national level. It is not Joe Biden's job to call governors, curious why that is brought up and the correlation. But, yes, Joe Biden is a democrat
Response to Perry Hooper, Jr First, Joe Biden has denounced violence and riots. He has done this time and again. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau views Antifa as "more of an ideology than an organization,"undercutting statements by President Donald Trump and others
In response to Barry Moore  Joe Biden has never dodged, evaded or refused to answer questions unless he had a reason. Biden was very specific about his plans, trump was not. Trump's tax cut for the upper echelon have done nothing but increase our deficit

of blatant disregard for human decency. The time for rapid testing was 6-8 months ago. Joe Biden has his own plan. No president has provided a supreme court justice list. This is a made up thing. Would you like him to list unicorn names too? I think he did address the question.

Trump said that Biden couldn‚Äôt even mention Law Enforcement because he would lose support from his radical left supporters.   Trump then refused to condemn White Supremacy because he would lose the support of his radical right supporters.

Biden was quoting the FBI. And please share your sources on your Antifa statement.
My thoughts exactly. Please allow Biden to speak, follow the rules you agreed to.

Wrong. He was asked to do it, offered to do it and then Wallace and Biden talked over him and changed the subject bc they didn't REALLY want him to do it with so many watching.
It does have a lot of irony embedded. I guess that means that Presidentis recognized by racist whites that the President isn‚Äôt racist and Biden could be?

John Roberts, if you had any backbone you would tell everyone that Trump has never supported white supremacy and his actions for minorities has proven it.  Did Biden ever back white supremacist or do any to hurt black persons? I say yes.
I agree with Joy, wholeheartedly.   Joe Biden  does not have to prove himself anymore, he's  running against an IDIOT.
You have changed for the worse.Why not ask why Biden was reading his answers from paper below suggesting he already had the andwers???
Wrong as usual. Watch the first 5 minutes of the debate. It was Joe Biden that was talking over The PRESIDENT. He started it, Trump finished it. And who had to resort to name calling? Your loser!!
The way Biden carrying himself cause of Trumps antics is really starting to piss me off.
Is that all everyone can say for Biden? He‚Äôs empathetic? Man, I don‚Äôt need him to be empathetic for me. I have family and friends for that! I need a president to watch borders, defend the nation...you know BIG stuff!
Also wanna point out how at the end of the debate, the Trumps looked like business partners and the Biden‚Äôs looked like an actual married couple. Old news tho
Payments were made to an investment firm, from a person that Trump himself has known for a long time. Not saying it was a setup to try to make Hunter Biden look bad, but that's certainly what it looks like to me.
Bruh Biden rlly scared to look trump in the eye
Just like Obama ‚ÄúYou can keep your doctor‚Äù. They don‚Äôt mind lying to win and then doing the opposite and bragging ‚ÄúIt worked, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù We should study Trump‚Äôs policies and then know that is exactly what he will do, unlike Biden.
Joe Biden is a crook
Here‚Äôs a question, would you take my $1000 betJoe Biden is going to win by a landslide? Put your money where your mouth is
I just imagine the words joe Biden would say to other powerful world leaders.. ‚Äúfolks‚Äù üòÇ
Did you know that Biden started at an HBCU? He said he did but that's a lie. He said he graduated in the top half of his law school class. He finished near the bottom. Another lie. I guess you learned Hillary is guilty so you're changing the subject  You're still wrong.
Democrats always accuse you of doing what they are doing. Case in point, Biden accused Trump of being a liar when he is constantly caught lying. Here's one example, and he told this same lie last night during the debate.
The only question one should consider if only choosing between the two legacy party candidates is this: Will Joe Biden serve the principles of economic liberty, personal liberty, and international non-aggression better than Donald Trump? They both have records now.
if you say your about facts and journalism why will you not just ask Biden if he wore any type of device to communicate with others off stage? Not a hard question to answer so should not be hard to ask. If you truly want to get to facts
You left this one out. Biden stated he didn‚Äôt support the Green New Deal, someone tell him his web site says different

Exactly, Wallace interrupted Biden 15 times, Wallace interrupted our President 76 times, not fair. Wallace is the worst moderator ever
the Biden Green Deal is basically the same as Green New Deal - just smaller big to start with.
Are you high? What debate did you watch? Read the statistics. Moderator challenged or cut off the President 76 times. Biden 15. That was at last count.
Interrupted by who? Trump was interrupted by the moderator 3 to 4 or more times Biden was. He was debating 2 people. Confronted with lies we would all get a little flustered.
Yes, thank you. No one could stand there and listen to someone just lie and not confront them on it. Wallace did a terrible job and laughed along with Biden on several occasions. Not professional.
Are you kidding me? I like many other people cannot Abide a liar. I doubt you could stand and listen to someone just lie after lie after lie and not get pissed off. And the moderator not only allowed this but asked no follow-up questions about Biden and his lying.
Counter argument from a lawyer: when you are questioning someone and they say something devastatingly harmful to their case, you move along. Don‚Äôt give them an opportunity to clear it up. Biden‚Äôs team is gleeful for the lack of follow up.
CD Your arguement fails on the facts- ( see Kirk‚Äôs numbers of interruptions). Did you even watch the debate performavpce by the tag team of Biden/Wallace vs Trump?
The GOP should never have agreed to Wallace being the‚Äù moderator‚Äù. It is doubtful that anyone did not know beforehand that Wallace would do everything he could to help hapless Senile Biden.
ABC News fact-checked Biden noted Trump condemned white supremacists after Charlottesville riots of Aug 2017, which Biden has also lied about.  A month later, the president signed a congressional resolution condemning white supremacy.
You have to be kidding. If Biden was president he would put us back in the same position Obama did, kowtowing to the Third World countries and Communists. Biden miss spoke half the time and the rest of the time he couldn‚Äôt get his thought out clearly. He has dementia sorry to say
And not to mention Biden wants to take our guns
Exactly, I thought he probably was wearing a Biden shirt
there‚Äôs so many things trump has done, mountains of things he has said that should have been it for him. And a lot of the things he says are much worse than this, but him bringing up Biden‚Äôs sons during the debate, one whom is dead.... i just will never get it.
Not that the truth matters to Trump supporters... but just in case.
This was not a debate - it was an argument. I still do not know what Joe Biden would do as President.
It was quite a love fest, Wallace even referenced Biden‚Äôs dad , how cozy
If your excuse is "Joe Biden was too disconnected from events to possibly have known he was commenting on them", maybe it's time you call for Joe to step aside.
It's almost as if Biden has staked out positions at both extremes on the matter at different points in his career and doesn't like being called to account for either one.
If we are complaining about Chris Wallace, then Trump lost and Biden won. Plain and simple.
Hannity: President Trump 'steamrolled' Biden in first debate
But Biden absolutely, proudly said ‚Äúevery major crime bill since 1976 that‚Äôs come out of this Congress, every minor crime bill, has had the name of the Democratic senator from the State of Delaware: Joe Biden.‚Äù.... And all targeted African American communities.
That‚Äôs because he has blood on his hands. Every cop that has been ambushed or targeted are a direct result of Biden giving validation to extreme groups such as BLM &amp; ANTIFA. PLEASE VOTE FOR TRUMP IF YOU SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT!
ABC's Martha Raddatz: 'There wasn't a whole lot of enthusiasm' for Biden during my road trip across America
Get your facts straight Paula, he was going after Hunter Biden and even corrected Joe Biden on this during the debate.
Actually, ‚Äúhe opens his lead on Biden‚Äù would be more accurate.  12-20% oversampling of Democrats giving a 8% lead in the fake polls for Biden means Trump is leading by 4-12%.
Don‚Äôt forget Biden‚Äôs brother who got a $1.5 billion U.S. government contract to build houses in Iraq when Biden was VP. Had never build a single house before.
Biden: "The suburbs are the most diverse they have ever been in systemically racist America."
Ok after I say that Wallace was the worst moderator ever. The rude trash taking street thug Biden is a jerk
#Debates2020 - well you are doing fact checking and your fact checker just said well she didn‚Äôt say those words but it is true. If she didn‚Äôt say those words that makes it false when Biden says she said it
So, why is it okay for Joe Biden to tell the POTUS to ‚ÄúShut up, man!‚Äù?
Wallace is a fraud, he might as well had on a Biden shirt
Wallace was cruel to President Trump, he let his buddy Biden do most of the talking
What the hell did you expect?? You must not have been listening to all those horrible things Biden said about Trump tonight! Trump has put up with all their lies and treason for four years! GIVE HIM HELL, TRUMP!!!
I agree with Sean. Ari, you must be kidding! Biden &amp; Dems have been calling Trump everything but a child of God since before he was elected!! I‚Äôm glad knew what he was doing and SHOULD have give Joe HELL!
Yup Biden (assuming he wins) is just a 4yr fill in....unless he does something awesome
Fox News should fire Chris Wallace. He spent the whole time bailing out and helping Biden.
Biden‚Äôs people got him through 82 of 96 minutes of the debate by having him reply ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying again‚Äù, ‚ÄúThat a lie and you know it‚Äù no matter what the facts were and Trump was almost always stating previously proven truth. Summary for Biden: I‚Äôm not Trump.
Neither candidate has giving me a reason to vote for them to be honest but Biden is the lesser of two evils IMO!!!
hmmmm...there was clear bias. furthermore, Joe Biden was lying through his teeth the whole time and wasn‚Äôt held accountable except by Trump. Trump had to debate both Chris Wallace and Biden.
Hopefully the crap he‚Äôs been doing the last 4 years will be enough. Your vote does matter! Biden is our only hope to end this insanity. He‚Äôs not a perfect fix but I just need the bleeding to stop right now and he‚Äôll be a fine tourniquet! ‚ù§Ô∏è
hopefully someone on the panel can discuss  running interference for Joe Biden during the entire debate, and not pushing Biden on his refusal to answer questions?
Yes 100%. They have got it in their minds that if Biden wins we will be a Socialist country. We had Clinton 8 years Obama 8 We didn‚Äôt have that then. It‚Äôs an excuse. I think they want to go back to the Good Old Days with all white people and the blacks are okay ‚Äúin their place‚Äù.
Top, if it‚Äôs with Biden lol. I remember watching Obama use his quick wit to outsmart Romney and I really liked it. Both sides were telling lies btw but Trump seemed more alive in a debate of two geriatrics nobody likes and devoid of the quick wit Obama had.
Bigger question. Why wont Biden condemn Antifa. They are literally burning down cities but Noooooo, muh white supremacy.
Biden will be retiring a lot earlier then.
He beat Biden and Wallace.
Man, President Trump acted like a petulant child for an hour and a half, and I'm not sure who comes out on top. Biden looked bad at points in performance. Substance? Biden. Showmanship? May have been Trump. #PresidentialDebate2020

There‚Äôs no point in responding to every baseless or discredited accusation Trump throws. Trump spent most of his time interrupting Biden to slander him and his family. He IS a clown. lol
His strategy looks to be to try to get Biden so confused that he can elicit multiple soundbites that make Biden sound senile. But even the most completely lucid person would have a hard time getting through this without a "what the what are you why did you...?"
Oh, I don't like either of them. My vote doesn't matter anyway, so I could vote for Mickey Mouse, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, or President Trump with the same outcome.
Literally did the climate debate for Biden
Talking bad about Bo Biden struggle with drug addiction, wow...new low for the office of President of The United States#Debates2020

This just be the last debate. Why should Biden deal with this clown show? Trump lies about lies and then lies some more. What a psychopath.
Why is Joe Biden allowed to interrupt and take your time but you are being admonished?
Trump: "Why did he get ten million dollars?"  Biden in my head: "If he really got that, im mad about the tie he got me for Christmas. Nah, that's hogwash."  #PresidentialDebate2020
Wallace rescued Biden from that.
Strongest moment for Biden might have been talking about Bo. #PresidentialDebate2020
Chris Wallace is a horrible moderator!  You know it, I know it and the American people know it! Totally protecting Biden!
Already down many times. When will Biden admit ANITFA and denounce them
Why didn't he ask Biden to condemn white supremacists?
Damn I hate Trump with all of me but Biden is Obama after a good edible and some agent orange.
Wallace is doing a good job of challenging Biden, and Trump still can't shut up.  #PresidentialDebate2020

Biden certainly isn't ACAB like Trump wants to make him out while also saying he used LE against the Black community. #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden says, ‚ÄúWe have to have a system where people are held accountable.‚Äù Trump can‚Äôt understand that because he doesn‚Äôt recognize the concept of accountability.
What a joke. How does that stand up against Trump being impeached for withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for dirt on Biden?  #Debates2020

I wish Biden had asked Barack Obama to come to the debate tonight and sit in the front row and stare at Crooked Donnie.
Hahaha. He might be scared of some things but debating Biden is certainly not one of them
Biden has been guilty of plagiarism multiple times. Now let‚Äôs see Hunter Biden‚Äôs returns. Also, let‚Äôs see Joe‚Äôs returns for taxes paid in other countries.

Who cares if Trump only paid $750 in taxes. He was only using the system that Biden and Pelosi help create. Any business owner should take full advantage of any tax loopholes.

Wait. What did Trump accuse Biden of?
What is a Maui?  I know black women age 18 to 30 are so crazy about him, half would rape him in public with their boyfriend or husband watching to hear them talk, but I figure Biden already has that demographic nailed down.
You have ZERO tweets/discussion regarding the Hunter Biden news. Please explain how you are ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Do you all at CNN not realize that all of America see your partisan behavior? Just bc you all ignore it doesn‚Äôt mean the majority of America is to dumb to recognize the hypocrisy.

Bush wasn‚Äôt in stage 12 dementia. Biden is.
voting at all in this system, between these two choices, feels to me like being complicit in fascism. I have no problem with people who vote for biden, but given his and kamala‚Äôs track record it feels very much like a vote for the continuation of the current oppressive system.
I see the logic in that, but at the same time is it morally permissible to vote for such a horrific person even if it‚Äôs to keep a more horrific person from taking office? I don‚Äôt know if I can bring myself to vote for biden. He‚Äôs the better of the two main choices, for sure, but
Can't happen. Biden's urine is under audit.Who thinks? Who knows Biden, Harris will destroy our country.
Nothing is far-fetched in 2020. By election day, both Trump and Biden could be out of the race.

Biden's a fucking joke but Trump has actively supported white supremacist groups, taken out full page adds calling for the execution of black teens in the past.  That quote is fucking awful, but literally the next words out of his mouth was a correction.
Trump did not wear a mask, and used the event to mock his Democratic opponent,¬†Joe Biden, for following social distancing guidelines. "You ever see the gyms with the circles?" Referencing a Biden event¬†held in a school gym with attendees observing social distancing guidelines.

Using history as an example, I can almost guarantee you that if/when Biden is elected president, it's never going to be confronted. Look at the United States after the Civil War. The country was so willing to "get things back to normal" that the south was completely forgiven.

Biden should never have agreed to stop any Trump ads. Sometimes it's possible to be too civilized. It just makes you a perpetual victim.
Since  is only going to run positive ads right now, here's my positive pitch for him:  I'm POSITIVE Joe Biden will be a decent, ethical President. I'm POSITIVE he will care about the well-being of his family, his staff, his supporters, and everyone in this country.
Biden isn‚Äôt quarantining, so I by your assessment he has no integrity. ü§î
Hell, no. Trump would have doubled down on the negative ads. Would anyone have been surprised?  But, Biden has taken the high road on this situation. Nobody can come back later and complain that Biden was kicking a man when he was down.

I feel so bad for Biden‚Äôs team today.  Navigating the pandemic in the US has become a test of creativity and attempting to mitigate risk. You have to start from a basis of trust that everyone around you is doing the same.
Donald Trump Jr is most likely controlled by a cocaine addiction by now, even as his own father, showing all signs of an Adderall dependency, chose to use Hunter Biden's addiction against Joe Biden in the debate. Biden's response helped lift the stigma against addiction.
Meanwhile 208,000+ Americans are dead, and it is likely we will see more of those close to Trump's inner circle testing positive. The Biden campaign is likely very PISSED about the nonchalant way Trump and his ilk have handled Hope Hick's diagnosis.

Poor Alec probably thought the Jim Carrey/Biden bit would give him a break.
I thought joe biden said Antifa was just an IDEA...now we know they are really just a JOKE!
Biden and the Leftist would love to here.
All we have at this point are his tweet, a vague letter from his doctor, and changes to his daily schedule. Since he is such a liar, we need independent confirmation.  Nobody wants more debates. He could just lie and say Biden wanted to cancel (which he has already done).

There are some disgusting people in this world. Would genuinely be concerned for Biden if he got it and am concerned for Trump, especially concerning they are both in their 70s. I just don't get people. So merciless and nasty.
I just hope they didn‚Äôt infect Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden.

No he joked about Biden always wearing one
Biden and Clinton said Byrd was their mentor... a KKK Grand Wizard. Crime bill of 1998, Democrat Bill, Clinton signed. That bill took blacks out of homes, stopped reproduction, as planned. Biden is on Soros/Gates side. UN Agenda 2030.

After talking about Biden wearing a mask Trump tested positive for COVID-19....
Also, we shouldn‚Äôt have to wait for the Biden Presidency for a nationwide mask mandate. This is inexplicable negligence on the health of millions of Americans.
Joe Biden Predator  via  so who is the racist after you watch this ü§î.
Biden and Hillary never condemned the Grand Wizard of the KKK Sen Robert Byrd a Democrat. No, both Joe's in the picture, celebrated with him.
Biden‚Äôs camp is at least transparent about what they release to the press. Joe will never hide anything that endangers his inner circle and the press corps.
By all accounts that disaster of a debate only helped Biden, so I guess now‚Äôs the time to lean extra hard into bonding with your peers by insulting the people you want to vote for him.
Larry Elder  Chris Wallace didn't ask   , ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt the democrat party, denounced? the party of slavery/segregation/Jim Crow, set an example by disgorging its assets and by transferred them to blacks? Why was Biden not ask to condemn ANTIFA
No she didn‚Äôt dance around it you idiots. Roberts is just pissed his wife was called out yesterday. For Christ sakes enough already!!  Biden is the won who was a supporter and great friend of Byrd who was a member of the KKK and proud of it. Maybe Biden was a closet member too.

Focus on facts Serge. So far Biden is lying. He‚Äôs unable to lead the country. I know that and you know that. There‚Äôs no other option for the USA but Donald J Trump. Biden is a racist joke.
1. BLM and Antifa are not the same. 2. Biden has rebuked, disavowed, opposed ALL violence. 3. Biden continues to say rioting is not protesting. 4. Did Biden tell Antifa to "Stand back and stand by."? #TrumpstersAreHypocrites #VoteHimOut
He should be fired. He interrupted the President over 70 times. He would not allow rebuttal time. He allowed Joe Biden to tell the Pres to shut up and called him a fool and a clown. Joe Biden is the Rude Bully.

Are you crazy üòù Trump is not a racist but joe Biden has done more to hurt black America than any politician in the last 30 years
Replace the second presidential debate with a Joe Biden Town Hall. America will be okay with this. I certainly will be.
All the proof you need to see how racist Trump is.....just kidding, thats Joe Biden
Actually, Biden started the crap. But as usual Chris is just like the Dems, blame Trump
BS and you know it! More lies. This Dem led Congress is nothing but lies. Where's But Hunter? How about the formal charges against Biden the Ukrainian government has againt joe Biden? I guess you think everyone forgot.
And he‚Äôs already said it many times. As he said, it will never matter to the liberal media and their Dem friends. Biden has more racist quotes and leanings in his 47 years in office than Trump has ever had.

Joe Biden was taught by KKK Pelosi and Schumer. We need him to denounce it now. Chris Wallace and John Roberts should never be let on the White House grounds. Fox needs to apologize to the President and press secretary.
I would love for Trump to do this. Biden started the BS but once again it's Trump made to look bad.
Why won't Biden admit antifa is a terrorist org of THUG'S? Dems play double standards again.

47 years later....Joe Biden is still making promises he won't keep
Maybe it's not Biden as much as it is the Democratic Party and their policies/platform...Trump is a fool but he's not advertising multiple tax increases, the worst, most abusive gun control program ever proposed, as well as other progressive policies that are all liberty killers
Way to cover for Biden Facebook! Sure glad we stopped that Russian influence so you all could take over
She's been tamed by the Democratic Party. That sit-in at Nancy pelosi's office gave me so much hope, but then she went ahead and called Nancy Pelosi mama bear, and is now telling us to vote for Joe Biden. The Democratic party has changed AOC, not the other way around. üò•

Not only that. Joe Biden started interrupting 3 times. He started it and Trump finished it. Wallace can‚Äôt handle the truth. Pitiful performance by Chris Wall-ass.
I could agree with that statement. But as you stated there would be a transition period for the industry with a Biden win which could last 6-12 months. A trump would be immediate rebound. Since we are talking options, I stand by my statement.

What it means is, no matter how many times he denounces racism &amp; white supremacy it will never be enough. Remind us how many times Biden has denounced Antifa? The organization, not the idea.
Most of Trump‚Äôs base still vehemently support him. Not only do they support Trump more than Democrats support Biden, but I could argue they love Trump more than Democrats hate him.  That could prove to be problematic for Biden.

It would be more legitimate if any of you cowards in the media asked Biden to denounce Antifa and BLM. After all, they are the ones that are burning and destroying communities and, if I'm not mistaken, their violence is what ran you out of the city, right?
Save some for the  #Debates2020 .  "While attending college, he served as an intern in the office of Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden, ‚Ä¶."

you and Biden wanted Trump to denounce proud boys, as a white supremacy group, which they are not. The media wants specific responses from Trump, while Biden is able to say I‚Äôm not answering that question.

Marxism 101: Accuse your opponents of that which you are already doing   Like real Russian Collusion, Biden's buddy was a KKK leader
Biden isn't exactly socialist lol
I might note it was nine two of which were for biden
Horrible debate. Fire your debate advisor!  Make Biden talk and answer questions. He will hang himself with confusion!
It's like Trump and biden have a lot of common traits or something
Chris Wallace asked Biden about the coming trillions of dollars in taxes he‚Äôs going to slap on us, if he‚Äôs elected, &amp; Biden couldn‚Äôt avoid it or deny it. That‚Äôs about as tough as it gets, because raising taxes is a campaign killer...a show stopper. Nobody wants higher taxes.
Yup, Trump's shithole America that turns everything filthy.
But saying one white supremacist supports Biden is a lot different than a majority that is actually supporting Donny.
I'll vote Biden for that reason, but I'm concerned there'll be violence and an attempted coup if he wins.
Joe Biden's debate performance revealed he does not support Law Enforcement, refuses to acknowledge his/son's real Russian Collusuon, and does not support your Green New Deal
Well I‚Äôve heard whining this morning from Dale Jackson, Matt Murphy, and now Limbaugh. All agreed it was Biden and all have blamed Wallaceüòé
His bias showed! If he asked  to condemn white supremacy, he should have asked Biden to condemn ANTIFA and BLM but he didn't and on top of that, he let him get away with saying ANTIFA was an "idea".
My Maga dad didn‚Äôt wanna talk about trump today. So ... uhh we‚Äôre fucked on the left right? If Biden wins over republicans he‚Äôll never move back that way and just slide right forever
and maybe if you scrambled up biden and trump policies and then tried to draw lines to what belongs to who you probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to because you couldn‚Äôt tell the difference
Hilarious.... Assbama was bragging when the stocks were soaring that HE created the economy.  Then with some market crash, now all of a sudden, Biden claims it is a Trump economy... Libtards, PLEASE stick to ONE narrative.
"Joe Biden did not wear a wire to aid him in the debate, Lead Stories and PolitiFact confirm"
some of you guys are not being critical enough of joe biden for me and it‚Äôs upsetting me
I‚Äôm not saying Biden is better. But I‚Äôll take him over the facist man child that is our current president.
One really glaring one is claiming that biden's son was dishonorably discharged. A 10-second Google search disproves that. testing positive for cocaine doesn't get you a dishonorable discharge.
Bolsonaro Slams Biden‚Äôs Plan to Stop Amazon Deforestation  This is bad...No matter what your political affiliation...
Somebody enlighten me what Biden lied about
He has been asked multiple times and answered!! How many times do you need to hear it?? Biden‚Äôs best friend was Sen Byrd, the Grand Wizard of the KKK, maybe you can ask him what he thinks.
Imagine these images inside of a light bulb over Joe Biden's head  üí°üí°üí°#ideas üí°üí°üí°
Sure, and he would've gladly cut off  mic. We all saw right through him and how he was covering for Biden. At one point, I thought he was going to walk up to Joe and wash his feet and his balls. Pathetic!
The controversial 1994 crime law that Joe Biden helped write, explained  via
No, what actually happened was that every time Trump had Biden on the ropes, Chris Wallace butted in and changed the subject so Biden wouldn't have to respond.
Good. They should. Patently false and also immature and reprehensible on Biden's part.
Incorrect. Biden used the term Law and Order while promising to help get psychologists into the police force while you emboldened the white nationalists. You‚Äôre basically becoming the equivalent of the Grand Wizard of the national New Ku Klux Klan. Good luck, George Wallace JR.
Yes and Donna Brazile with him! Can‚Äôt believe they hired her in the first place. Biden was reading his answer at one point, did he get the questions?? Probably.
Trump and Biden ahh about to blow away with the wind soon. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è President shouldn‚Äôt be this old
I'm not sure what the "far-left" is. I support the Green New Deal myself, so I'm a bit underwhelmed here, but he is right in saying he's the Democratic Party because he's the nominee and the nominee's platform is the party platform. I already voted absentee for Biden, no regrets.
Did you watch the debate last night? What are your thoughts?
This is classic Biden outreach. No wonder he‚Äôs gonna get obliterated.   88% of democrats want M4A 70% want cannabis legal 60% want a GND &gt;50% want free public college and loan forgiveness.  This ain‚Äôt radical left. It‚Äôs literally the base being ignored.
So you don‚Äôt think Biden has blown off the left?   He said he‚Äôd veto m4a, doesn‚Äôt support a GND, when told about kids drowning in student loans (which is HIS fault specifically) he said ‚ÄúI have no sympathy‚Äù.  Biden is a neoliberal asswipe who‚Äôs only in it bc Obama made some calls
I‚Äôll take that 5k and vote for Biden dripped in Gucci. People also don‚Äôt realize that it would have to pass the House and Senate and we all know a bill like that won‚Äôt come from Republicans.
During the debate, Biden refused to answer several questions, not only from President Trump but also from his 'bud', Chris.
‚ÄúAntifa is just an idea‚Äù Joe Biden   Not only did he not tell them to stand down he didn‚Äôt even acknowledge them as an organization. Both are missing the mark
Steamrolled? So that's a fair tactic now? And yes, Joe Biden used interruptions and names, but far fewer times than Donald Trump had. So no, this does not result in a Trump victory. Strange how I see shades of Margaret Thatcher's last days 30 years ago in Trump.
Love this new name Smoking Joe Biden üåäüåäüåäüåä
The joe biden inshallah tweets were alright, everything else was some hacky political "both sides suck" bullshit
Who won the debate? Neither. Biden stumbled and stammered. 47 years in government office and nothing to his credit. Trump was rude and abrasive, couldn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut when it wasn‚Äôt his turn to speak
Biden basically told Trump to Git good
Lie‚Äôn Biden at it again . Stupidest human ever paraded out
Joe Biden is a lying sack of used dog food, lies come spewing out of his mouth. He knows Trump never said the things he‚Äôs accusing him of saying about men in the Armed Forces. As a Korean War vet I resent his comments. Trump has built up our military.
Trump: "Joe Biden is going to do a thing that will benefit working people and poor people."  Biden: "NO! I MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!"  ~~ I'm voting green because they are the only party that is offering single-payer healthcare and a green new deal.
Biden wasn‚Äôt acting he didn‚Äôt know anything. You ever got into a argument with a mfer and they are talking over you, you can‚Äôt get not one piece of a statement in. So you just be like you can have it mfer shit, because you not about to argue with they bitch ass lol
Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes...a lot. That‚Äôs all I needed to see &amp; hear last night, before I switched it over to the Vols vs South Carolina rewind. I‚Äôm counting on those continued Trump tax cuts.
And fwiw I‚Äôm not going into the streets to fight a Nazi just to put Joe Biden in office. He‚Äôs blatantly disregarded the entire left wing of the US in favor of chasing republicans votes. So he can have them.   If you want change it isn‚Äôt coming from the ballot box.
Wish washy liar Biden !  He probably doesn‚Äôt know what he believes.  Come on Patriots let‚Äôs follow each other and create a Trump Twitter Army !!
Chris Wallace asks Biden to share his thoughts on racism,  but asks Trump why is he a white supremacist.  What a biased moderator Chris Wallace turned out to be.
The tactic of #JoeWired during last night's debate was "deny and lie." Case in point is Green New Deal, which is part of #DenyandLieBiden's platform found ON his own webpage.  has plenty of fodder to attack moving forward. Will #MSM fact-check Biden? #Debates2020
I haven‚Äôt heard anybody mention the fact that Joe Biden said he would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% isn‚Äôt that a big deal in scary for business owners ?
There should be a GOP and a Dem as dual moderators.The moderator bias ALWAYS sways the debate.A candidate should not have to fight for fairness,nor should he have to debate 2 people.Biden also needs to be checked thoroughly for cheating. He cheated,not a doubt.
If I had a dollar for every time Trump interrupted Biden during this debate, I will have paid more in income taxes than Donald Trump.
Has Anyone Suggested Sound Proof Rooms for the Presidential Debates and when it's time for the opponent to speak--the mic goes dead for the other candidate?  Trump Clearly Violated the Rules He Agreed to.   #stopthelies #stopTrump
I think Biden was sharper than he was in any of the debates in the primary
So Joe Biden isn‚Äôt a socialist then?
Chris Wallace owes  and American people an apology. Absolutely worse moderated debate in history. Trump had to debate Wallace and Biden. Wallace lose fox base his show will tank.
What are your thoughts on last night's #PresidentialDebate? What stood out to you? Did it influence who you will vote for? #Debates2020
It is a lie to equate the words and actions of Trump &amp; Biden.
Trump: "My opponent is going to do a thing that will benefit the working class and poor"  Joe Biden: "NO I WILL MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!"
Honestly. Biden has some moments where he did get Rocked. His tone would go up and quieter when he didn‚Äôt quite no how to answer and trumpet tried his best to knock him off with constant interruptions. Trunk should have let him stumble on his own words.
Trump allowed Biden to paint him as a heartless millionaire/billionaire.   DT missed huge swing to hit back that Biden is a multimillionaire and earned $950k last year with no career except ‚Äúpublic service‚Äù
Hunter Biden is about as crooked as they come tbh
The 2 in 10 who viewed the debate as positive were Trump and Biden #Debates2020
Nobody won. The American people lost. Biden did as well as anyone could wrestling a pig.
With regards to Biden and antifa? I feel like Chris Wallace let him off the hook. I also feel like Chris Wallace was a little bit of a bodyguard to use the words of a buddy of mine. I'm not even sure Biden answered the question.
I saw commentary after saying that Biden's camp thought he did a good job at showing he could be the adult in the room... while calling the president a clown, telling him to shut up, etc. They both acted like children. They literally acted like my 5 and 7 y/o going back and forth
Then follows with the ‚Äòstand back and stand down‚Äô statement after Wallace finished his question. Biden refuses to acknowledge Antifa - ship I don‚Äôt play into conspiracy theories, it‚Äôs obviously more than an idea.
Lmao imagine being so fucking dumb to think Radical Leftists support Biden
Last night at the beginning of the debate, Trump was calmer than I expected (oranger too), and I remember thinking Biden was going to need to rattle him. He obviously did and we got that awful debate.
Biden: D, Trump: C-, Wallace, C
You said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Biden supports helping police weed out the police who commit crimes and have them be held accountable.‚Äù  But they literally violently resist the tiniest bit of accountability, so I‚Äôm not sure how one helps them apply any.Champ Biden for First Dog‚ù§Ô∏èüíúüíô

Why does Joe Biden's messaging have the same theme as the Communist Chinese messaging? Almost like they are following the same script. Is Joe siding with our enemies now?
Funny how you guys can use the internet for Twitter but not for Google
Being older, I look up facts Before I shoot my mouth off. Joe Biden does not own an island. JFK never said anything about " secret societies" controlling everything. Please keep your silly conspiracy theories to yourself!üíÄ
Oh yeah, Biden was the main interupter.  Are you kidding me?
I had worried about their debate and was telling my husband about my feelings that covid was around ...stay safe Joe Biden ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
Trump.   Carter.   Clinton.  Biden   That‚Äôs an order... but of what?
No you did not.  It was not a debate, you were afraid for Biden to speak.  You never shut up and obeyed the rules of the debate.  Oh, I forgot, rules do not apply to you.

If Biden wins, she‚Äôll be canceled in short order. Without Trump, her entire schtick vanishes. Much like MSNBC‚Äôs ratings, she‚Äôs entirely dependent on Trump being president.
Fair question, seeing as how Trump has tested positive for Covid, as have a handful of other members of his team, 3 days after teasing Biden for wearing masks
Biden is a complete idiot. I would love to punch him in the face.
So Biden says wear a mask as he touches his make several times. Follow the science he says. Well stop touching your face.
Sources close to the Biden campaign are telling me they plan to put limits on cell phones for anyone under 18. Only blood relatives and 5 closest friends can be contacted.
Joe Biden has tested negative for the coronavirus, his primary care doctor confirmed on Friday.

JUST IN: Joe Biden and Wife Dr. Jill Biden Both Test Negative for CoVID-19
Biden has tested negative.
Good thats how it should be. Trump didn't scale back his plans to install a new justice after RBG passing.   And if Biden got Covid, I highly doubt Trump would stop or slow down his efforts at campaigning.
So Biden has been in office for 47 years and has zero accomplishments where President Trump has been in office for only 4 years and has accomplished more than Biden and Obama did
That‚Äôs what I was thinking ! It‚Äôs all s he can avoid b I got embarrassed by Biden

If #TrumpIsARacist uses #COVID19 as the reason for not being able to debate then we better just get 90 mins of Joe Biden clearly and effectively explaining his plans to the people so everyone understands more clearly.
Exactly. They found the little footage they have of Trump wearing  a masm when just on Tuesday he mocked Biden for wearing a mask as often as he does
#TrumpHasCovid after mocking Biden at the debate for mask wearing.  But I‚Äôll take the high road and say that I don‚Äôt wish this awful disease on anyone.
Trump mocked Biden at the debate for mask wearing.  But I‚Äôll take the high road and say that I don‚Äôt wish this awful virus on anyone.
And he was mocking Biden for wearing masks everywhere.  I could be mean, but I don‚Äôt wish this virus on anyone.   President Trump says he and First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive for COVID-19
and he was clowning biden for wearing a mask when he needed it the most ü§£ü§£

Excuse to cut off Trump's comments and let Biden get the last word on everything
I will for Trump. Trump is the first president to label KKK as terrorist. I do not believe he is a White Supremacist. But, what i found interesting is that Antifa and BLM are the one tearing up our country and they didnt ask Biden about it.
2020 has been absolutely ridiculous. I dont want another 4 years of this. Biden sucks but last night alone proved at least he has a plan. Trump literally picked on this man the entire night and offered NO solution ü§£üôèüèæ

What does that make Biden? What does that make YOU?
Biden is not now, and has never been, a Progressive. He‚Äôs proud of that. It‚Äôs exactly the reason the DNC shoved him to ‚Äòthe head of the class‚Äô bc Bernie, a proud Progressive, was kicking Biden‚Äôs, the heir apparent‚Äôs, ass. I‚Äôm voting for Biden but I‚Äôd vote for a rock over Trump
At all!!! Biden literally kept referring to ALL black people as ‚ÄúAfrican American.‚Äù That just shows that he does not care about the authenticity of our people. Trump wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge white supremacy.
But at the same time , watching the debate was pointless. As soon as I cut it on , Trump was talking about Biden‚Äôs son. I cut it off immediately. Trump‚Äôs verbal battle tactic ruins every conversation and debate. I‚Äôm not watching a Yo Mama battle bruh. #BidenIn5
i wish he would have asked Biden about BLM and Antifa. They are afterall the ones tearing up dem cities.
Your Biden did not show a whole lot of class either. Plus Biden blatantly lied on Green new Deal and badmouthing the military.
fact check on CNN...that is funny. What stood out for me is Biden lied about bad mouthing the military and the green new deal. Those were blatant lies. Plus, i find it very concerning that biden inc is getting millions from overseas.

Biden said he does not support the green new deal but when you go on his website it clearly says he thinks it will build up the framework of this country
How can anyone think Biden can be a president when the whole time speaking against trump all he could do is stutter and Deny facts being said to him. If joe could save America he should have done it 47 years ago don't you think ?
You need to run instead of Biden.. your our only hope
3 things stood out to me. Biden did bad mouth the military, it is on video. Secondly, his website lists the green new deal which he says he doesnt support. Thirdly, his family getting money from Russia, China and Ukraine is an issue.
Why would CNN give Biden such low numbers?  Would expect them to show at least 90% of their audience.#FakeNews
Me giving the DAD face, trying to get President Trump and Joe Biden to calm down during last night‚Äôs very heated Presidential Debate.
Biden lied about Green New Deal. And lied about calling our military people derogatory names. Green New Deal was or is on his website. Him calling out the military in on video. Plus, why wasnt biden asked about denouncing Antifa and BLM ?
i wish they would have asked Biden about the thugs in Antifa and BLM. But of course, Antifa is an idea?
This changed nothing for voters.  But biden clearly lied about son and calling military names.
Biden blatantly lied about calling military people names. If u need video contact me. It's easy to find.
So?  I‚Äôm still voting for Trump and you‚Äôre still voting for Biden.  The debates did nothing, but this, this petty grade school stuff? This is what got Trump Elected.  He‚Äôs the biggest kid in the schoolyard and you all keep playing his games.  Sad
Words spoken most by Biden last night‚Äî‚Äî- ‚Äònot true‚Äô ‚Äî‚Äî and everyone knows that it‚Äôs not true simply because Joe said it wasn‚Äôt.  All the tapes and wire xfer doc‚Äôs are not true, huh Joe? RiGhT!
Chris Wallace!!! President Trump was debating Biden not you!!! Sorry ass barny rubble looking mother fucker!!! Complete sham debate!!!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
I was very impressed he went into it. It's nothing to be ashamed of and would have done the same thing. Let's all be honest with each other! We all have issues. When Biden comes with truth, there is nothing Trump can say. Own it!
It's like a dark political TV show that show writers would balk at as being too farfetched. We have to be better than this and elect people that have ethical and professional standards. Biden is a decent, upstanding civil servant that will so right by this country and its people

From my basement..  Joe Biden says he and Jill Biden tested negative for coronavirus
Who would vote for Biden no matter whot time he gets up ???
Even then you know that the left would be all over people on social media who mocked Biden for it. But its all funny since its Trump. Just pointing out an obvious double standard. We have an election in a month and this is going to be spun so many ways
Wallace was the worse moderator ever. He should be fired for allowing comments made by the idiot Biden without saying something to him.
If it were the other way around and Biden got covid the far right would be mocking him and the left would be talking about how evil they were for wishing death on someone but since its Trump i guess all the jokes are ok. We're in a weird place. I dont wish death on my worst enemy

Biden says at debate he doesn't support Green New Deal, but his campaign website calls it 'crucial framework'
Does the author of this piece not realize that many of the criticisms he collected contradict each other? Trump is running interference for Biden, and also Trump exerted no control over the debate.
His whole modus operandi is to confuse, depress, and find a way to fatally unnerve his audience  so they don‚Äôt realize what is really going on!  He wasn‚Äôt going to give Biden a chance to tell us anything.  He is a compulsive liar and needs to be in a psychiatric center.  üò±üò±üò±

Why did hunter Biden receive 3.5 million from the wife of a Russian mayor. Russia Russia Russia
Pictures show that Biden had an earpiece, a wire inside his right coat and another device on his left wrist.
You do realize Biden is compromised by his son Hunter in receiving large amounts of money from Russia ,Ukraine and China. Those of us who have had security clearance know the risk. So why didn‚Äôt hunter receive a dishonorable discharge for drug use, who interfered.

Will Raise Taxes. Will outlaw coal and fossil fuels.  Will destroy any semblance of an economy we have. But Hunter Biden will profit from it all. Remember, he doesn't work for us.
Well He denied it but..here's the black and white: "Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."
The Commission on Presidential Debates says it‚Äôs adding new ‚Äútools to maintain order‚Äù to the upcoming debates following the first meeting between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
Biden looked and acted like DEATH WARMED OVER compared to Trump!

Joe Biden: No More Coal or Oil Plants in America  via
That's BS. No reasonable person watched that &amp; thought Biden was the let down.  Trump is the diminished one; he's literally projecting all of his weaknesses on Biden.  He's in mental crisis &amp; its sick that the enablers are getting away with this.  Nobody is in charge now  No one.
The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
WHY IS BIDEN SO FUNNY IM SCREAMING
antifa isn‚Äôt an organizationüíÄ and biden condemned any violence from protests multiple times during the debate
Anyone else notice last night how Joe Biden‚Äôs suit looked like it came from a thrift store
Trump was making good progress combatting the opioid epidemic as recent as last year by expanding treatment options and access to mental health services, so whether it's Trump or Biden next, hopefully they pick right up on the progress we were making
‚ÄúAlmost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,‚Äù said Trump, whose exchange with Democrat Joe Biden left the extremist group Proud Boys celebrating what some of its members saw as tacit approval. &gt;&gt;

Dawg its absolutely heartbreaking. I definitely realize Biden and Harris do not have a perfect voting track record in this space but A LOT has changed and been learned since then and seeing him stick up for his son like that gave me hope.
Biden can't control Trump? Why should the President need controlling,  Fascism Barbie?
President Trump said the Democratic Party "wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare" and that they would "dominate" Joe Biden. The Democratic nominee responded: "I am the Democratic Party right now." &gt;&gt;

Both sides may some claims that weren't exactly reflective of reality.
I thought this comment looked good for Biden from a presentation standpoint, but we can't forget that Biden has authored multiple bills that locked up millions of addicts for drug use. Not to mention his running mate being notorious for locking up thousands in California for weed
I did too! I've been a life long republican but now independent. Biden gives me hope.
By voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden has a stutter. The fact Donald Trump interrupted and cut him off ALL night shows he was trying to make him nervous to make it worse and flop the debate. He could sell it to the media the next day as ‚ÄúSleepy Joe losing his mind.‚Äù Gross
Addiction is a disease and America has a silent issue they don‚Äôt want to look at or admit and ppl just want to act like we‚Äôre all squeaky clean and anyone who suffers is weak. Trump taking a jab at Biden‚Äôs son was extremely shameful and somewhat symbolic of the disconnect.
Biden‚Äôs comment last night about his son resonated with me so deeply. As a person with experience looking after family members and friends with addiction and still loving them the same that was such a touching &amp; humble thing to hear. Especially coming from a POLITICIAN.
Watch some highlights from last night's debate at the link! &gt;&gt;
I do not agree 100% with either of the Presidential Candidates, but if Biden wins this country is doomed! Biden will push this country under and that was made clear last night! Biden is not the right President for this country at this time, Trump is!
Also worth noting that act included Biden doing to Paul Ryan what Trump did to him last night. But he‚Äôs going to restore decency or something.
After last night,  the polls should be Biden 99% Trump 1%  just his family.

Biden can't denounce Antifa because he sees them as his fighters who are taking on the Proud Boys. The fact that Antifa act like actual brownshirts isn't a deal breaker for Biden in the same way Biden looking the other way on Antifa isn't a deal breaker to Biden supporters.
Biden dominated the debate. He talked to the American people. Trump argues with the moderator.
You're not going to scare me into voting for biden by saying it's life or death and we have to "save the country" from trump when there are literally no fundamental differences between the two to me. I don't care who wins or loses. They both fucking suck.
And of course, she forgot (ignored) that Biden indicated Antifa was "an idea, not an organization" People are only concerned about character when it allows them to attack the other tribe. We're definitely in a bad place.
Fuck no. Don't blame that shit on third party voters. Run someone worth voting for and we'll vote for them. But neither Biden or Trump deserves my vote so they aren't getting it. They're both authoritarian pieces of shit. I don't care who wins or loses either way. Just need 5%
The one great thing about the debate is that both Trump and Biden lied shamelessly. The people calling out one but looking the other way on the other will tell you all you need to know about their integrity. It gives you a good idea as to which Twitter follows are actually honest
Pretty solid review by  Everybody Loses, Which Helps Biden
After more than a year of circling each other, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio. Here's how things went.
Chris Wallace, you caused the chaos with your biased questioning and interrupting of the President. You never interrupted Biden! You‚Äôre a disgrace to journalism as any member of CNN.  The American people want fairness.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden sparred Tuesday in their first of three debates leading up to the Nov. 3 election. Here's a look at how their statements stacked up with the facts.
God u have no clue how the real world works. I would have done the same thing. It‚Äôs called  write offs and our tax code that Biden wrote.
You are ill. Biden won by not losing. Trump gained nothing by his hideous performance.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden met Tuesday night for the first of three presidential debates.
Biden by a landslide
The biggest difference? Trump argued with the moderator. Biden spoke to the American people.
Your blind.  Biden‚Äôs a punk
More like the opposite.  Wallace gave the answers to Biden.  Pathetic
President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night. Here's how the event played out online.
The first presidential debate of the 2020 general election is in the books. President Donald Trump VS. former Vice President Joe Biden. Did you watch?   Comments will be monitored, but we want to hear from you Wiregrass.. What were your initial thoughts?
Trump, and Biden was on adderall
That was delightful. Now, Trump &amp; Biden go backstage for cocktails and more friendly banter. #Debates2020
Never stopped Biden from interrupting
Temporary contractor threw Trump mail-in ballots in trash, Pennsylvania county officials say - ABC News Another fact that Biden denies!
I‚Äôm riding with Biden!!!!  #PresidentialDebate2020 #OperationGetTrumpOut
Can‚Äôt believe Trump said nobody would show up to Biden rallies as if holding 20,000 person rallies is even remotely a good idea during a pandemic. What a fucking stupid point üò≠
Joe Biden called American servicemembers "stupid bastards." He must apol...  via  Joe said play it so make sure you do and share it! He is a lying scum bag!
Do you ever shut up?! Like you live on twitter lol. I‚Äôd be more worried about how orange you are next to Biden lol
Biden is winning
Lincoln - A House divided will not stand.  JFK - Ask not what your country can do for you; rather, ask what you can do for your country.  Biden - Will you shut up, man?
Biden says we have become weaker and sicker, he looks like a corpse up there tonight!
I was worried at the beginning. I thought Trump was doing well. Now, for the last hour Biden has dominated.
Have you shouted out to Biden about why his family is accepting money from Russia?
Im in favor of law, you follwing it.   Joe Biden.   Boom.
When Biden talks directly to the American people,  that's effective.
Youre the worst president America has ever had.   Joe Biden.   Boom!!!!
The moderator for this debate is definitely democrat. Trump said ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm debating you, not Biden.‚Äù üòÇ They can‚Äôt even finish a sentence without interrupting each other. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Really? u just named the states that were won last election. Wow. Douchebag. Can‚Äôt remember what was the last election outcome again? I‚Äôm caking it now Biden doesn‚Äôt win more than 5 states.
I said‚Äúwhen‚Äùmeaning I‚Äôm predicting obviously.There have already been numerous stories by the media on bs mailins If u can‚Äôt see how last 6 months has transpired to accept mail in voting then u r just lyin to urself.Only way Biden wins is from mail in votes not casted by the voter
Veterans/Veteran Families United against piece of shit JOE BIDEN!  #BidenCrimeFamily
So u want Biden? üòÇ o please do explain how the dementia patient will help our country?
Hate to break it to you. Trump won‚Äôt be leaving I seriously doubt Biden wins more than 5 states
Because voting Biden would be even dumber
Who rigged it, ya hack???? Joe Biden, Congress, and Mullah Obama signed it into law!!! #crackabook
ü§£üòÇ yea right. Keep dreaming. Trump is going to completely demolish Biden. The stage is his and he knows it. Biden stands no chance unless dems chest their way in the White House
Seriously. U r disturbed. Trump is going to crush Biden. Earpiece goes both ways?!? U make zero sense. He is doing that so he can show America just how incompetent Biden really is. I‚Äôm going to be entertained tonight as Biden is completely manhandled and abused
The real question: Is Trump going to destroy Biden tonight? #Trump2020
Biden doesn‚Äôt have any issues to talk about.  All he says is Trump did this and that.  Yea, at least he tries.  47 years of nothing!
The Bidens' returns show the couple paid almost $300,000 in federal taxes in 2019, including almost $288,000 in personal income tax. The Bidens reported taxable income of $944,737. &gt;&gt;

Between those two, will there BE a winner? Trump will just grunt, hoot, and fling poo, and Biden will stand there, pissing his Depends, and wondering where he is.
People putting too much stock in the Joe Biden doing well when he debates against Donald Trump.  Remember that Hillary Clinton moped the floor with Trump &amp; Obama but still didn't get to the White House #Debates2020
That‚Äôs great. They need to release 20 years worth as they have done with Trump. Then sit back and be amazed how Biden became a multi millionaire on his paltry gov salary. Where does his and families wealth come from? Hunter knows. Biden knows too. And Kamalala too. 20 years worth

I hope hes in prison in 2024. He'll be 75 in 2024. Younger than joe Biden is right now.
Trump will be fact checked by  1000 times, but his base will eat it up. Biden will be solid but Trump and his capos will state something stupid to falsely accuse him of cognitive decline. An Adderall will shoot out of Trump's nose. Again.
Im not a troll. Not by a damn site. Im just giving an honest opinion. I hate the man. If you were around me, youd know that. I voted for Biden.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are set to meet Tuesday for their highly anticipated first debate. Here are memorable moments in presidential debate history.
Florida and north Carolina will be to close to call and still counting after 11/3 but Biden will have it. It isn't gonna be close enough for Trump to cheat.
Contrary to popular opinion,  i think itll all be over on election night. I believe Biden will have 270 electoral votes,  when California polls close, because the only thing left to count are mail in ballots,  and Biden will already have the lead in those states.
Here we go again! The polls!   #Remember2016Polls

You sure are in love with Hunter Biden. My god.
Whether you're for Trump or Biden, I don't care. I say that to say this, doesn't all the celebrities stating that they're going to leave if Trump is reelected remind you of an upset child? I mean " If i don't get my way I'm going to take my toys and leave!!" type of mentality??

I agree!! This is just not right at all! I may not like Biden but I wish him no harm! Biden even had nice words for our President First Lady! Biden supporters need to rethink what they r saying! How would they feel if he had the coronavirus?? This hatred needs to STOP!!

Wonder how many times Joe Biden has publicly denounced domestic terrorist groups like Antifa and BLM??
Joe Biden DID NOT attack Donald Trump in his Michigan speech. That's a perfectly ridiculous LIE.
Look, I don‚Äôt support Biden, but I like the move with the ads. No man should be insulted while facing possible death, no matter the circumstances.
Of course not, but Biden is a man of class and integrity, Trump isn‚Äôt.
He somehow thinks this makes his classless, tasteless tweet better.  It makes it look worse!  At least Biden had the generally good taste to send good wishes.    I pity people like this.  I never cared for RBG, but I was sorry to see her die.    This man needs serious help.

NBC and "Saturday Night Live" gave viewers a sneak peek on Thursday of actor Jim Carrey suited up as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
I care if they get sick given their stupidity because I care deeply about the impact on our country and our world.  They exposed Biden and his family. They exposed SCOTUS nominee and Senators and Congresscritters. It is just the latest horrid act by these horrid people.
Get the morning's latest developments on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump testing positive for the coronavirus.
Biden stood on the stage in front of unmasked Trump, his family and staff. This could be an unparalleled disaster for the country and world. Both candidates, scotus nominees, half the Senate. ......
(2/2)‚ÄîFurthermore, does it not, similarly, seem ‚Äúfishy‚Äù that  has NOT been asked, repeatedly, to denounce #BlackBloc, #Marxists or ANY GROUPS that support and/or promote #Marxism? Even if one wants to claim #ANTIFA‚Äôs only an idea, Biden‚Äôs never pushed on the above groups
Highly unlikely. Biden wears masks.
Biden not to be outdone though with the courage to fight through dementia. An inspiration to the disabled elderly of our country, nay the world.
I‚Äôm not saying u did I‚Äôm just asking if u think Biden is too
Also there is video evidence of Biden touching women and children wrong with as well accusations so will u say Biden is a molester or sexist.

He made fun of Biden wearing one when he doesn‚Äôt need to like somone wearing it in their car by themselves looking like an idiot. Sounds like u didn‚Äôt even watch the debate or ur just clouded by ur hate. And like he stated he went off what the medical professionals said
God dammit. How's Biden?   How's Pence?
So... Hope Hicks could potentially have infected both Trump and Biden as she was on site at the debate while infected.
November 3rd only if Trump wins. If Biden wins, it will never end
Neither were Democrats in 2016. I'm voting for Biden but let me be clear, this is hypocritical on our side too. Bottom line is Pubs had control of the Senate, then and now. Voting has consequences. We must vote at all costs to flip the Senate.

John Roberts you asked you question, your question was answered but you kept whining like a crybaby. Why don‚Äôt you ask the same question to Biden‚Äôs camp regarding BLM and Antifa.  I used to  enjoy seeing you in briefings but I have lost respect for you.
This is why folks are frustrated Bret. He has denounced this over and over again but Chris Wallace or any other reporter has failed to ever ask Joe Biden to condemn Antifa. He said Antifa was an idea which we both know is false. An idea doesn't burn buildings and loot businesses.
Well guess what folks wouldn't' blame the media if you did the same thing to Joe Biden but you didn't. Chris Wallace didn't ask him to denounce Antifa. Fox has never asked Biden to do any of it. He thinks it's an idea. And Trump has deconned it over and over.
It's getting old Jedediah. He has condemned this over and over and are you asking Joe Biden to condemn Antifa. No you are not. You haven't yet. He thinks it's an idea. I guess ideas destroy property and burn buildings in 2020.
He has condemned this stuff over and over and over again. And what point is enough. He shouldn't have to say this every time just to satisfy the media's insistent need. Have you asked Joe Biden to disavow Antifa. No he think's they are an idea.

Remember Trump shitting on Hunter Biden's struggle with addiction during a nationally televised debate? I do.

Chris Wallace interrupted Trump 70+ times and Biden only 15 times. Let that sink in. Terrible awful no good moderation.
Within 15 minutes, the interruptions and talking over one another at Tuesday's presidential debate had deteriorated to the point that Biden blurted out, ‚ÄúWill you shut up, man?‚Äù
It should be. It was yet another Destroy Trump event. Biden lies every breath. Used contact video screen technology. It was clearly not a debate!
I rather doubt Biden can do another one.
The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.

Trump was interrupted 76 times, Biden 15!
In my opnion, Trump used the tool of interruption to dominate the conversation similar to Joe againts Paul in 2012.
I saw a video about the technology of using contacts as a video screen. Biden has blue eyes but last night they were brown. Hmmm
And no Biden supporters said ‚Äú this mf spittin‚Äù

Biden said it right "SHUT UP MAN"
Ok but the part where Biden called him a clown and then took it back, apologized, and replaced it with "person" as if he had used a deplorable expletive was kind of adorable. The restraint!

Are you gonna call when Biden denounces ANTIFA? Its the same principal, you cant condemn one without condemning the other, unless you support them then you dont wont either of them too.
Reminder: Trump &amp; Biden are not the only two presidential candidates. There is a 3rd option. Vote Libertarian Jo Jorgensen.
Have you looked at Biden‚Äôs, and Harris‚Äô for that matter, records about race? Have you seen how many times Biden voted AGAINST any race but his own in his 47 years in public office!?!? If anything they are about even on this talking point in their personal views.
Interesting parallel is the nobody is asking why Biden refused to condemn ANTIFA and said they werent an organization.

He still stammered and stuttered even with the wire. He can‚Äôt do anything on his own. Trump is right Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. Biden is the liar and dishonest one not Trump.
You‚Äôre straight up lying about the undecided voters on CNN. They had 14 undecideds, 6 decided who to vote for and they broke 4-2 for Biden.

President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night. Here's how the event played out online.
Trump has the truth on his side, he just needs to learn how to use it better in a debate format.  He doesn‚Äôt like debate prep. It‚Äôs understandable.  There were a lot of missed opportunities tonight.   Biden is a weak empty suit.  Knock his ass out next time,
Because there‚Äôs a good chance this spiral continues even if Biden wins and is able to take office
I know someone who wasn't asked to condemn actual terrorist organizations.... That would be Biden condemning BLM/Antifa who carry out acts of terrorism weekly.
Biden was never asked to condemn BLM/Antifa. Both domestic terrorist organizations. So yeah the silent majority will be heard... Again. #Trump2020
Friend, I don‚Äôt need to watch it again. I know what I saw the first time.  He interrupted many times but it was in defense of himself because of all the lies Biden was telling.  I know you‚Äôre against Trump and I‚Äôm for Trump. Let‚Äôs just leave it at that.

A vote for Joe Biden is a wasted vote on a man that's been in Politics for 47 years and has done nothing for the people.
Joe Biden is so incompetent and can‚Äôt answer simple questions. He gets flustered and lost when he gets frustrated. His strategy was to attack President Trump and lie in between. That‚Äôs all he has. If you don‚Äôt see that, you have issues.
Even Chris Wallace called out trump multiple times throughout the night. This is not a ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù thing. Biden was largely in control and answering the questions, while trump was incoherent, whiny, and attacking the moderator

Because Biden is a respectful human being.
Dear Everyone !,  Think of what he is doing to us, to our families, our businesses, our Country's HEALTH !.  Trump is a scavenger, he is a clown, as Biden said, he has harmed us far beyond our knowledge!  Do not vote for him, please!!!!
Not y‚Äôall simping over Joe Biden üíÄ
If they knew he had it and he spit in Joe Biden‚Äôs mouth on national television Tuesday night in an attempt at infection, I would not have been shocked. why are we still shocked? is anyone giving them the benefit of the doubt? no sympathy. kick his ass Nov 3rd.
That‚Äôs why Biden said during the debates that antifa is just an idea but the problem with that is now people who really don‚Äôt know what antifa was about, took the name antifa to further their propaganda.
Dont lump us all together.  Look at the Lincoln Project. There are still decent Republicans and they are voting Biden.
I have no respect for Chris Wallace.  He sabotaged Trump in debate with left wing questions especially that he deny White Supremacy when he has done so over &amp; over.  But he did not push Biden on the destructive Antifa as a terrorist group as they are burning our cities &amp; with BLM
You Biden lovers are crack heads.  Wait, we are sounding like the debates. ü§™ Sorry, everyone has an opinion and doing this definitely won‚Äôt change someone‚Äôs mind on whom to vote for.  Unfortunately I believe both sides benefit when we are divided. Hope you have a good weekend ‚úåÔ∏è
David Duke and Richard Spencer have endorsed Biden.  Where is his denouncement of that and of antifa and blm
Biden behaves in a presidential manner.
were you born an idiot or did you develop it over time? The President denounced white supremacy for the thousandth time! Lying idiot!!! Now go ask lying Biden about the real threat, Black Lives Mater&amp; Antifa! Go ahead I know you can do it! Even an idiot can learn.
Let‚Äôs talk about how Trump has Covid after making fun of Biden during the debate for wearing a mask all the time

Prime example of the things I‚Äôve been talking about this week with my students. This is exactly the reaction that this situation deserves, regardless of your political stance. Thank you, Mr. Biden for your appropriate response.
Fuck that noise. No punishing Biden for doing things right, legal, honest and ethical. Why should he suspend his campaign. Onward we go!!!!
So now that #TrumpHasCovid, has anyone tested Biden? They were just at a debate together..
Trumps whole family took off their mask at the debate. Biden needs to be tested.
Is it just me or does this news seems sus #TrumpHasCovid #Trump #Biden #FakeNews #Election2020 #Debate2020

ladies and gents my fianc√© has gone from being brainwashed by his conservative family to vote for trump in 2016 to voting for Biden in 2020 can I get a Hell Yeah
John Roberts pitching a fit on tv!!! I‚Äôm done with Fox except Tucker, Hannity, and Ingraham.  No one is harping the fact that Joe Biden wouldn‚Äôt denounce antifa and blm!!! Fox is not fair and balanced anymore.  OAN!
The irony is this was said in the context of attacking Hunter Biden for exploiting his father‚Äôs position.  H Biden was administratively discharged from the military due to a failed drug test while Joe Biden was Vice President. Does anyone think Trump‚Äôs sons would even be tested?
Ohhhhhh i cant WAIT til November 4th so i can tell a whole buncha mfrs seek refuge somewhere else when Biden beats the dogshit out of  Take yalls racist, sexist,bigot asses and GO. Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya!!
Disappointed in #ShepardSmith‚Äôs first show tonight. He was heavy handed on the ‚ÄúTrump denouncing White Supremacists‚Äù issue with nothing on Biden not denouncing BLM/ANTIFA violence. So far Shepard is no different than the others. I had high hopes.

You really don‚Äôt have to do anything to get Biden voters to wear a mask

seeing people with no shame at all still support this clown baby over the not all there grandpa is truly depressing. I‚Äôll leave with this simple analogy. Supporting trump is like thinking 2+2=5 and Biden would be like 2+2=4 but it took him 10 seconds to get there.
I genuinely feel so bad for Biden. He really does care and this orange is acting like a child.
That was not fair that he was a democrat commentator but you held your own against both of them &amp; I loved your info about how bad the new green deal of theirs would be for America. Biden was acting like We thought a drugged up person would act he couldn‚Äôt even stay on point!
President Trump, if there is another debate I think you should just answer the questions of the moderator (and I use that term loosely, CW was clearly biased and helped Biden as often as he could) and let Biden make a fool out of himself.  We, the people, know what a GREAT job...
Wallace with Biden's help
The weird thing is that bc of Trump‚Äôs failure to handle Covid she has to do her show from home. She‚Äôs definitely never been a victim of Biden.
I don't know how Biden made it through this debate. I wanna yell at the Trump crybaby to shut the hell up. You can't even get a damn word in.
A vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump and the White Supremacist will see it as a win and permission after Trumps statements tonight. You do not want the guilt I have experienced for the last 2 years over voting for Trump.
please tell #YangGang to stand in for Biden. Im seeing to many wasting the vote for you knowing it isnt possible. After tonight we cant waste a single vote. Trump must not win!
Do you want more Trump? Dont waste the vote. Might as well not vote if your wasting it. Its going to be Trump or Biden. Dont be guilty of sitting on the fense. History doesnt favor well with fence sitters.
his son "was" an addict.(cocaine) biden pushed lengthened criminal sentences, particularly for nonwhite users, don't recall his son ever going to jail for drugs tho?? What have i missed?  Now Biden's changed thoughts about jail for drug users? Swish swash confused?
tell me what this is Biden has on his wrist?
What is this biden has on his wrist???
Chris Wallace sabotaged Trump constantly, always gave Biden the leeway to keep lying with all his false narratives.  Biden is the biggest liar &amp; phony in this country.  Trump has done more for this country in 3yrs than Biden did in 47 yrs. shame on Chris Wallace!!
Can we drop trump &amp; Biden off at the nursing home? I‚Äôd rather have someone from Gen Z in office. That was embarrassing.
Word of advice...Don't lose your job, pension, retirement, freedom, life, debating with other people about Trump/Biden. Trust me, it's not worth it. #Share
At this moment idc if Biden is bad. I don‚Äôt want a white supremacist as president.
#Debate2020 Biden won
It is what it is because you are who you are. ~Joe Biden speaking to Trump about Coronavirus
Biden lost my vote. To weak
Biden lost my vote. He is to weak.
Biden lost my vote tonight. He is weak.
Trump never once addressed the American people directly. He wouldnt look right into the camera and knowledge us. Biden talked to us the people multiple times.  It was a debate between the ego maniac and the man trying to save us from him.  #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden is the ‚Äúfar end‚Äù of the left political spectrum?
imagine asking a white person to denonce white people because they‚Äôre white ü§î Almost as bad as getting your black card revoked if you don‚Äôt vote for biden
The POTUS set the violent tone for this debate and did not abide by debate protocol. Biden responded in kind at times... but never in the same order of magnitude he received. Tonight's shameful display is firmly on Trump.
I can‚Äôt sit and watch two more of these... #Debate2020 #DebateTuesday #Election2020 #shitshow #trump #biden #PresidentialDebate
This is true. Bad moment for Biden.
Trump told Biden that he makes up lies #PresidentialDebate #ManStop
I‚Äôm really late to the party. Somehow the debate has managed to become a three man shouting match and Biden talking about emitting methane. We‚Äôre in trouble aren‚Äôt we?
A vote for Biden is a vote for a ‚Äúhard job‚Äù. #Election2020 #2020PresidentialDebate #debate
He asked Trump to denounce white supremacist but even after it came up did not ask Biden to denounce ANTIFA
Trump insulting Biden‚Äôs son is beyond low
Biden can‚Äôt say law and order but trump can‚Äôt even say white supremacy is bad
Biden showing real restraint by not banging his head on his podium repeatedly. #Debate2020
Chris Wallace is a joke of a moderator and he‚Äôs completely babying Joe Biden.  So obvious he‚Äôs a liberal. We need Hannity, Ingraham, and Tucker Carlson.  Sick of Chris Wallace being so rude and disrespectful to our President
Omg I‚Äôll never forget when I was on a podcast and one of the host said he thought Biden would stomp trump in the debates and Bernie would be an easy target. I‚Äôm now sitting here just sipping my tea looking at them like oh really? #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate
I‚Äôm voting for Howie Hawkins, because fuck Biden and Trump.
Chris Wallace is a joke of a moderator.  He‚Äôs babysitting joe Biden
Our great President.  But I swear Chris Wallace favors Biden
I'll say Biden wasn't my first choice at all. But hearing them side by side.... Biden kinda makes me proud sometimes. Especially dealing with him.
I‚Äôm not on Trump‚Äôs side. But go ahead and hit Biden with that crime bill!!!! #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate #debates

Biden going in on covid is making him look real good. Keep it up! #2020debate #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate #debate
Is  ever going to get to go First? And is the moderator ever going to shut Trump up enough to let him speak?  #PresidentialDebate2020
Omg did Biden just say maybe you should try shooting up with bleach!! Lol üòÇ I can‚Äôt lol #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020
I watch 2 minutes. Enough time to hear Biden say, ‚Äúshut up, buddy‚Äù. That was enough to get my vote! üòÇ
Is Biden just going to let Trump call him stupid? Nah. Whoop his ass. #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden said to shoot up some bleach omg
So Joe Biden thinks all of you Democrats are stupid?
This moderator is allowing Trump to run away will the talking and not letting Biden speak. #PresidentialDebate2020
Joe Biden just told this bitch to get it togetherrrrrrrrrr
‚ÄúWill you shut up man.‚Äù -Joe Biden. This is how all of America feels. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020
#PresidentialDebate2020 is Biden going to be allowed to speak?
Biden laughing at Trump is gold. Like Trump is acting like a child. Omg.
I‚Äôm watching the debates, and I just see Trump and Biden and think about the future... We‚Äôre fucked.

That's how you kill science. A vote wasted is a vote Biden really needs to defeat Trump. Make no mistake Trump has declaired war on science and that includes the science that will get us to Mars.
Who‚Äôs ready the debate tonight?!  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday #election #election2020 #trump #biden #usa #debate #circus #Democrat #Republican
Honestly, either outcome makes me scared. One makes me scared about the present(Trump) and one makes me worried we‚Äôll get a worse Trump down the line, because we won‚Äôt fix anything(Biden). We live in scary times.
The prez took advantage of a tax policy obamy and biden baby came up with...a lot a demo-dummies took advantage at the same time...remember, he‚Äôs a businessman, not a politician...CC
Pretty happy with health insurance, which I PAY FOR, so voting Biden but ok
No one can say what good Biden has done or anything good about him all they can do is slam trump with lies.

Well if you want to call it a donation or as the rest of us say giving to the IRS for back taxes, I would say Biden has never had to. CANT WAIT TO SEE YOUR DAD IN A ORANGE JUMP SUIT. LOOSER
All the powers that be will be protecting Biden, even Wallace.
Tomorrow will be must watch TV for the debate. The president has set the bar really low for Biden and I think he will do better than he thinks.
We‚Äôve already discussed this before. Unless you can explain to me how a single vote for Biden will shift 30% of the vote, then it doesn‚Äôt matter who I vote for. Love you though
So do these people know who FDR is? Biden is as progressive as him. Now so are the McCain‚Äôs. Plz stop comparing yourself to FDR if you don‚Äôt even support Medicare4all.
Perhaps you can explain how it matters. Perhaps you can explain how Hunter Biden receives an All-Star appointment when celebrities and politicos always receive all star appointments! Perhaps you can explain how Conda Lisa rice is now on the SEC championship board???
Yes. It is. Because I‚Äôve studied ALL of the information AND Russian propaganda stemming from the Hunter Biden BS! ALL! The PROPAGANDA! It‚Äôs just that! It‚Äôs the BS that caused trump to be impeached, it‚Äôs the stuff of 4 Chan. It‚Äôs GARBAGE!
Can't imagine Biden debating anyone. Even though Wallace will toss him softballs &amp; Donna Brazile has probably already gotten the questions to pass along,Trump doesn't have to say a word, just let Joe talk, or interrupt him once &amp; his train of thought will be on the Orient Express
Can't imagine the drugs required for Biden to debate Trump. Methamphetamine may be helpful.  At least it'll keep Biden awake &amp; provide short term remedy to his declining cognitive function.  Trump mentioned drug testing. If roles reversed, MSM would scream for Trump to be tested!
I just saw a Trump ad attacking Biden because he joined conservatives back in the day, you know back before we were irredeemably bankrupt, to try to freeze entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. The sad state of ‚Äúconservatism‚Äù in Trumpland.
All this BS regarding Trump‚Äôs taxes yet the media could care less about Biden being owned by foreign nationals.
I just donated $7.50 to Joe Biden.  Joe knows us. #TrumpsAFraud

Durham is protecting all of these corrupt actors in the FBI &amp; DOJ!  He is a dirty judge if he doesn‚Äôt rpt about all of the info &amp; release all the documents that have been requested for 3years!  You are carrying water for the Corrupt Democrates such as Hunter Biden &amp; his father!
I have already vote for Biden and Harris !!!
This is a statement from General Michael Flynn and his attorney Sidney Powell to the country.  Please read and be alerted as to the corrupt actions of the government under Obama-Biden Administration and now Judge Sullivan!

Joe Biden needs to quaranteen
Suspending negative ads is more than Trump deserves.  He would never show Vice President Biden the same respect!
Whats funny is that I thought trump did his best during the debate on the very first question. Fairly succinct and to the point. Biden can't fill 2 min if he wanted to. Seriously think this would benefit trump, he just cant shut his mouth. I'm a democrat, and hate trump btw.

FAKE NEWS! You‚Äôre afraid of Joe Biden. You‚Äôre a snowflake.
No doubt, he would be at a rally screaming this proves Biden is weak, then say "how stupid is Biden, he wore a mask and still got the virus, then get the crowd to chant "mask don't work, masks don't work"
it was between gay cow and LED squid not fucking biden and trump sit down
Christie told The Associated Press on Friday that the last time he was with the president was Tuesday during preparations for his debate with former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland.
Wrong. He was asked to do it, offered to do it and then Wallace and Biden talked over him and changed the subject bc they didn't REALLY want him to do it with so many watching.
Look at this crap.  But Joe Biden thinks these people are just ideas.
I'm afraid, Joe Biden, the only American you will be representing is yourself and your family.  We've already seen it.
Well if he infected Biden.. its not a total loss... good riddance if you ask me.. TRUMP 2020
That would mean he knew tuesday night that he had symptoms and still the MF and his campaign of enablers did not alert the Biden campaign of this fact and danger.  Clearly this attempted murder with depraved indifference.  They knew it is deadly and exposed people anyway!
Chris Wallace Speaks Out, Claims Biden Answered Question On Packing Courts: Here Is What Was Actually Said
Obama, Clinton, Biden, and Harris Wish Trump Well After Diagnosis. While Pelosi and Schumer Use Statements For Political Attacks. Remember Pelosi and Schumer in November. Neither of them deserve to be in leadership roles of any kind. #VoteRepublican
He had to stick to Biden's talking points
I don‚Äôt think there will be anymore debates between Trumpf and Biden.
This man is sick in the head &amp; has been for a long time. He's talking about stealing the election &amp; as usual the wimpy Ds come up with this foolishness. Who cares if it sick or not, by now whoever is going to vote for him or Biden isn't going to change their minds. Just vote ppl.
Trump campaign has some nerve to complain about fairness. It's now revealed that Trump had COVID on Wed morning, right after debate on Tues. And did not have the courtesy to notify Biden campaign.
It does have a lot of irony embedded. I guess that means that Presidentis recognized by racist whites that the President isn‚Äôt racist and Biden could be?
I think of all those beautiful souls who died all alone, and he didn't give a shit. If Joe Biden were sick, Trump would be out there poking fun about him being sick and still being hateful. I don't care. The GOP gets exactly what they deserved.  Trump took a stupid risk, he lost.

Joe Biden has tested negative for being fit for president.
I don't think Trump is going to get any sympathy bump. Biden may get an "I-told-you-so" bump, though.
Biden is the top
Only if they suspend the Barrett nomination. Biden pulls negative ads. Trump campaign says they won‚Äôt return the favor. Graham says full steam ahead with SCOTUS even though a majority of Americans want to wait until after the election, but Biden should stop campaigning.
I mean, he attacked Biden for having ‚Äúthe biggest mask I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù  ??
So fast forward .... if Joe Biden contracts covid-19 as the president ... he shouldn‚Äôt receive the best possible care ? The left would go absolutely nuts
This behavior is typical of far-left radicals.They are emboldened to act out now.I hope people will see what kind of civilization we will have in the future when this hatred is rewarded by a socialistic system of government.Joe Biden denies it, but he is just their puppet.
Good cause that dude is a tooooool ‚Äîhe was the one that kept wanting to disgrace Biden. ALSO IF ALL THESE SENATORS ARE POSITIVE THERE GOES AMY!
And what‚Äôs more‚Äî- it has crossed my mind that Trump could have tested positive  before the debate‚Äî but didn‚Äôt have symptoms yet so thought he was gonna be fine‚Äîand deliberately withheld this info to even his prep team‚Äî hoping to infect Biden during the debate when yelling.
There was never an expectation of decency from the Trump campaign. But that‚Äôs okay. Remember, ‚Äúwhen they go low, we go high.‚Äù Be grateful to the Biden/ Harris campaign for taking the high road. It‚Äôs what America needs right now.
Thank you for saying this, if Joe had gotten it, Trump would have attacked him relentlessly and today he would have traveled to Wisconsin for a giant superspeader rally where he would have mocked Biden for wearing a mask and still getting the virus.
Is this the same Kung flu?! Is this the same monster who made fun just this past Tuesday about Joe Biden wearing a mask?! #Karma
. Joe Biden is nothing more than a MEAT PUPPET for the new, radical left
Will Trump campaign let up its attack on election to disrupt it and prevent peaceful transfer of power to Biden-Harris? Must Biden side mount all out combat against Trump campaign's attack on the election? #bidencoalition #Biden2020 #BidenHarris2020
So #FoxNews want  to stop campaigning cause that dumb MF sick when all he had to do was wear a mask &amp; social distance but refused to do either. U can‚Äôt make this shit up. Biden better keep pushing cause that ignorant MF damn sure wouldn‚Äôt stop if it was reversed
If pence gets the republican votes that would have gone to Biden then he can turn around and pardon tRump. This is a scary idea. Pay attention!
Question: tRump is in the hospital. If he cannot perform his duties VP pence steps up. What happens to the election if tRump is still unable to lead? Does pence get the nomination against Biden? Has this been the plan all along?
When Biden gets elected they either wear the freaking mask or stay the fuk home.  They are not the experty, and we have rules/laws to keep people safe. I am tired of their ignorant nonsense...they claim to be pro-life...that's Bullshit, they are pro-death.
1)can't believe this has to be explained to you but the POTUS &amp; First Lady are more important than the millions of people less successful than he is.  Have you considered that if Biden and his former partner hadn't lied to us about what was in their plan, and hadn't lied about...
We‚Äôre praying for you to make a full and swift recovery so you can get back on the campaign trail and kick creepy Joe Biden‚Äôs ass! God bless you &amp; Melania, Mr President!
And before you say ‚Äúwhat racist words?‚Äù let‚Äôs start with him opposing desegregation and saying that he doesn‚Äôt want his children growing up in a racial jungle.
Biden‚Äôs racist words should demand far more scrutiny and questioning than anything the current POTUS has said about black people. And yet Acosta and others painting a narrative that expects him to continuously denounce a small group of assholes who hold no power in 2020.

If any one thinks trump would stop his campaign if Biden was ill you got to got bite your self plus I believe he is way worse than they are telling us way worse and one more unrelated thing welcome back Shepard Smith we missed you it not fox we know you will continue to do great
As a conservative I wish they would stop all the negative ads and attacks just for a few days like the Biden team has. I don‚Äôt see why this has to be so hard...
imagine what it would be like to have puppet Biden in office and running mate. A horrible night mare.
When Biden is elected will you cry? Or will you be so deluded that you start shooting people?
HE WANTS To KISS BIDEN SO BAD
Just a reminder that Trump mocked Biden last Tuesday night for wearing a mask ‚Äúall the time‚Äù and for not holding large events. Joe, Jill, and his campaign staff are all healthy tonight.
I hope Biden will test himself again in a week or so to be sure but then go back to campaigning. However, it feels pretty safe to say that America likely knows who they're voting for already.
This is what they would say..we told you he is too sick, he's too old, the drugs didn't help at all, see the mask doesn't work bc he wore one and still got it, they would post a video of an old falling &amp; put Biden face on it,&amp; saw something abt Hunter. trump is as low as they get
God protect the First Family and every family that's dealing with this virus" - Joe Biden
Have trump ever thought of anyone but himself? You saw how proudly his family sat at the debate w/o mask while he mocked Biden. And you think he cares about SS agents.
Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star. And had to pay her off. What is it with you people?!  Trump is president, not Hunter Biden. I will be praying for you people.

Biden needs to put all ads back up thus week.
trump is faking it. He finally was told to find a way to get out of ‚Äòdebating‚Äô Biden.
Biden will simply forget what he's into
Then I guess they have set the tone for the absence of resptect.  I believe the Biden campaign should hit the asshat with all they have got.

Biden supports unrestricted abortion up until birth. There is nothing crueler than injecting acid or forceps  into a woman's womb and killing an innocent baby.

Biden lie? Only when he has the brain cells to form a sentence.
Biden needs to denounce this crappppp from his party. He is the Democratic Party, right?
Official: Biden campaign taking down attack ads
I predict in the event Doug Jones loses his Senate race and Biden wins the presidency Doug Jones will be appointed to the cabinet.
I agree and commend Biden for taking down negative ads. But as someone who had Covid and was unemployed for months do not feel like I need to take the high road. ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù
Context is key. The main difference is tRUmp didn‚Äôt creat those jobs, they were from businesses opening back up. Most went BACK to their jobs. Obama/Biden created new jobs.
Biden has already stopped negative Trump ads. That‚Äôs respectful enough &amp; honestly more than Trump deserves.
Yes. Yes because the left believes covid is real and wears masks/social distances. Trump literally made fun of Biden for wearing a mask ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù on national tv and you don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs actually happening?! A special kind of stupid.
I think VP Biden sets a tone all should follow.  Thank you, sir.
Fox News doesn't care anything about Biden and the Democrats. Fox News can just get somewhere. They have no power in Biden's campaign.
I wouldn‚Äôt tell Zeke anything.   He thinks anyone past age 75 should be put to death.  He‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs Dr. Death.

Biden can say this because he has the one thing Trump lacks.....compassion!
I heard that Biden spit on POTUS and that‚Äôs how he contracted the virus.
Would they do that for Biden? Hell No, so Biden presses on.
Since Biden has discontinued negative ads on true, true but negative, then why are they debating.
I find it hard to have any compassion for Trump because the did the debate without advising the Biden campaign that he had been exposed.  He should have immediately gone into quarantine, instead he galumped around spreading virus to the unsuspecting...
Great news for Joe Biden. Let the campaigning continue.
Her account should be SUSPENDED PERMANENTLY, like mine would rightly be if I tweeted this about #Biden. What an evil lowlife. üò°
But Biden said nothing of any substance!  He avoids answering questions!  TRUMP 2020!  üá∫üá∏
One theological correction. Only the divine can offer grace. Joe Biden offers mercy to others in their moments of struggle.
POTUS took the highest dose of an experimental drug that only 275 people have received. Doesn‚Äôt support the idea that he‚Äôs experiencing mild symptoms.  Also, all these negative tests, Biden included, aren‚Äôt definitive. Virus incubates for up to 5-7 days.
Here‚Äôs to 4 more years!  He‚Äôs a MUCH better president than Joe Biden ever could be!  üá∫üá∏

Why doesn‚Äôt Fox News suspend their propaganda for 14 days? Biden has followed CDC guidelines unlike Trump who is battling Coronavirus!
Why should Biden pay for Trump ignoring reality?
Fox Channel can go Fuk themselves. Trust me, if Biden had gotten COVID Trump would be ramping up his campaign....
No, I believe its just a stupid conspiracy, like most usually are... However, if he bounces back with a clean bill of health quickly enough, it could have an unforseen effect on voter's opinion of Biden, since the media has been running stories worrying about Biden's health today
God please, Let President Trump be alright, his wife and his whole circle of contacts and exposures. Please God. Politics be damn (momentarily). I‚Äôm VOTING Biden no matter what. But God, Trump is our President NOW. His health and the State of the Union are at risk.üá∫üá∏üôè

But can you vote Biden and say you support school choice? He certainly doesn‚Äôt.
Is there anything you won't lie about regarding Biden baloney plans. 40 fn years in government by yeah, next time he's gonna do something different. Yeah, poor old Joe didn't figure climate catastrophe until just now when running for President?
extremely and I could tell Biden got furious but he still managed to keep his cool and I respect him for that but he still sucks
Like i don‚Äôt like Biden and I disagree with a lot  of things he‚Äôs done and his policies  but that comment from trump at the debate made me empathize like fuck with man. I know he super cocky rn now that he‚Äôs tested negative ü§£
It is. And now I am worried for Biden.
He didn't die, or on a ventilator. Besides he was complaining abt Biden being in the basement &amp; now he is campaigning. You just can't please that trump crowd. They will love him to the very end. It's like parents that love their no good for nothing child till the day they die.

Has anyone heard from Jr Trump today? Has he reflected on his criticism of Biden following the CDC guidelines?
Should have worn a mask.  It‚Äôs not Biden‚Äôs fault trump got covid.
Biden knows that this is a lie, but like Hillary he believes that Democrat voters are stupid and will believe whatever they tell them. Sadly they are right.
Seriously. Trump has chosen to push dangerous non-mask policies and has made it political. He has belittled Biden &amp; others for being careful. Now he pays the price but Biden reaps the rewards of being prudent.
He‚Äôs held mega in person super spreaders when Biden has held responsible remote events.
I agree with liberation, revolution all of that, but we could probably get there faster with Trump out of office. So for RIGHT NOW let‚Äôs vote for Biden. Because Trump is way too terrible.
Why on earth would Biden suspend his campaign? Someone please explain.
He mocked Biden for being careful and FOLLOWING CDC guidelines! #NoSympathyForTrump
Welp Biden is healthy
When Trump asked ‚Äúwhat do you want me to call them‚Äù, it was BIDEN who said ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù. So Trump condemned the name Biden gave him. You seem to have selective hearing
Phil Hartman would‚Äôve made a great Biden.
gen z is too comfortable drooling over biden ,, it‚Äôs so weird

That they did not contact the Biden team is despicable and should be scandalized as such.
My conspiracy theories: (1)  they wanted Biden to also get sick so Trump could blame him and say masks do not work and (2) Trump had no intention of telling anyone until he felt ill.

I am voting for Doug Jones for US Senate, Joe Biden/Harris for the White House.
Maybe a President Biden in March would have issued a national mask policy and shut the US down so 200,000 people wouldn‚Äôt have died
What type of shit question is this? Biden/Harris have modeled safe practices throughout the campaign; I bet y‚Äôall will slow down the rhetoric of Biden being in the bunker, right?  Safe practices = less possibility for infection. Trump outright refused to do this, so here we are

BREAKING:
WASHINGTON ( -- Campaign says Democratic nominee Joe Biden and wife Jill have tested negative for coronavirus.
Joe Biden would receive "Get well soon Mr. Vice President" from Republican's. Think about that.
The only person who gets a pass for wishing Trump a speedy recovery is Biden, and that's because he has a reputation to uphold of being respectful.
The campaign says Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden have tested negative for coronavirus.
Joe Biden reports that he and Dr. Jill Biden have tested NEGATIVE for #COVID19
tool #chriswallace actually asked Biden is building millions of new houses would "hurt the economy" These mfers are dumb as fuck! Really? Having lots more economic activity including building homes would HURT the economy? Just unforgivably stupid!
AND...the beat goes on. Biden should not suspend his campaign.

It‚Äôs unclear if Biden will appear at his scheduled campaign events later in the day.
Trump and staff knew he had been exposed and never told Biden campaign. I am so pissed.  And Biden should not suspend his campaign.
Not surprised, it was heartless, then again Trump &amp; his cohorts don't care about anyone else.  Had they possessed any concern or compassion they would have informed the Biden campaign.  That is why Covid is spreading like wildfire again. Trump/GOP doesn't give a crap about us.
Correct....he and his cohorts have lied so much who believes anything they say.  His illness needs to be confirmed by independent medical professionals.  And Biden should not suspend his campaign...
Biden better TF not. Y‚Äôall think if it was reversed he would.
Biden should continue with his campaign....it is not his fault Trump got Covid, We need to keep voters engaged so that we can win in November.
Actually, it is absolutely typical of Biden. If it were me, I‚Äôd be pointing out that GOP hadn‚Äôt planned to tell anyone until reporters forced their hands. But I‚Äôm more petty than Biden seems to be.
No Biden should not suspend. Donnie wouldn‚Äôt if it was the other way around. You cannot take the moral high ground when your opponent is as evil as donnie
Think she is just playing nice stay of radar she went against him on mask mandate pissing off every Trumper in this state. So that was a plus. At least we don't have Florida Georgia or Texas's Govnor. Her friend Roy Moore going after her for mask mandate. Riden with Biden
You know rational people don't watch Hannity. Stop trying to preach to the choir and throwing everything back on Biden. Your schtick is about as stale as "But her e-mails" got around August 2016. #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpMeltdown
Why punish Biden for tRump‚Äôs stupidity? I pray for his recovery, I do, but he brought this on himself
Trump is faking COVID so he doesn't have to debate Biden anymore
honestly out of all the stuff to come out of 2020 the last thing i would‚Äôve expected to see was a joe biden edit to WAP
Can you imagine the tweets from DJT if Biden tested positive?
Exactly. Trump‚Äôs stupidity finally caught up with him in a way that can‚Äôt be ignored.  This should have no influence on Biden‚Äôs campaign. Biden‚Äôs done everything right.
No. I think they should take extra care to make sure they are healthy and to make their events covid safe (i.e. zero direct interaction with public). But McCain suspended his campaign in 2008 and cost himself the election. Biden should stay safe but not flinch

I wonder what the ole dump truck would be saying if President Biden had become ill with COVID instead of him?
If you go on his Web page He has disvowed  The White supremacist, the Ku-Klux Klan.  But what gets me is Joe Biden thinks antifa is an idea not a hate group. Smdh

Biden‚Äôs marketing team did that on his website haha
There‚Äôs no uncertainty here, we are certain that the demonic party is going to loose and loose horribly. We are certain that good will triumph over evil. We are certain that anything you publish is mostly lies. We are certain that joe Biden loves to grope and sniff girls. Facts
Joe Biden did this morning but the fact that many leaders in the world sent best wishes is a message that he is respected in the world unlike what the Dems would have you to believe.
Why the hell would Biden suspend?
. says he's praying for  after positive #COVID-19 test
And get attention off the Debate and Joe Biden all headlines on Trump contracts COVID19
Because you are a class guy and have morals. Biden/Harris2020!!
I just hope he didn‚Äôt infect Biden and Wallace.
himself will reportedly be tested for COVID-19 sometime today.
Staying safe? You mean like wearing masks when and where it‚Äôs required and not acting like entitled pieces of crap?
Remind me... In the debate, did he mock Biden for wearing a mask all the time? #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCorona I will pray for a quick recovery for them. I also pray for our nation to have wise and empathetic leadership.
No one had anything to do with him getting the virus but himself. He denied it, called it a hoax, mocked mask wearers even Biden during the debate. 200k have died, who better for this to happen to show this virus exist. Now let's see his thoughts on it now. Hope he gets well.
is anyone worried trump is lying and only trying to throw off biden üòü
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden now responding to the president and first lady‚Äôs Covid 19 diagnosis...
No, Chris Wallace, you do with your biased questions. Example: Trump, do you denounce white supremacy? Biden: no question about Antifa. Which one has been burning down cities and bullying people minding their own business?
Trump has always condemned White Supremecy, and Biden stupidly calls Antifa an "idea".
If Pres. Trump is not capable of debating Joe Biden on Oct. 22, then the Presidential Commission on Debates should hold a Town Hall with Joe Biden or let Mike Pence stand in for DJT. America wants to view a real debate on policy and proposals. #BidenVsTrump #HarrisVsPence
This headline is a little sensational. We‚Äôre not spiraling out of control because Trump has Covid. Many leaders have gotten it. I hope him and the First Lady recover. And I hope we elect Joe Biden has the next president. üòâ
And my hope isn‚Äôt in Biden winning the election, although I pray he wins. I pray every effort to suppress votes is exposed and defeated. I pray white Christians see Trump for who he really is.
Prayers for  and  and I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôll recover. To those making the disgusting reaction comments to this, I hope 45 destroys Biden next month and the Republicans regain complete control of Congress and the White House. #KAG
Byrd renounced his brief membership again and again, tRUmp can‚Äôt clearly say he denounces white supremacy even once.
And you was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask....
Because it was a stupid question based on a huge left media lie that he didn‚Äôt do it 3 years ago in Charlottesville. When it happens he condemned them and basically Biden and Wallace and the left keep pushing the fake lie now o very 3 years! Biden and crime bill is real travesty!
Hold on 45 got COVID??? after he was up there mocking Biden about wearing his mask????!? Nahhhhh lol üòÇ
Didn‚Äôt he make fun of Biden for wearing a mask?
But he got his little feelings hurt and hasn‚Äôt reported that a Socialist  White Supremacist has ENDORSED BIDEN.

Trump's bragged about getting tested daily (this was a couple months ago) but since he's stopped taking it seriously, I doubt he's been tested regularly. Agree that Biden should be taking tests on at least a weekly basis.
Biden stood on the debate stage Tuesday alongside President Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 late Thursday.
Your husband made fun of Biden for wearing a mask! I am sure both of you are taking Hydroxychloroquine!
I do think it is fake news,  He did make fun of Biden for wearing a mask!

Wonder how close he got to Biden. Wonder if Biden might have it.   What if it takes both of them out weeks before the election. I mean, 2020 ain't done yet.
Because he has done it framing 109 times. Why did they not ask Biden about his racist past? Against desegregation and bussing, authored the 94 crime bill, also was against the voting act! His mentor was Robert Byrd KKK grand Dragon

Trump being a jackass made changes necessary (if he‚Äôd shut up, Biden would have looked old and lacking energy) but to change the rules midstream is a terrible idea. I think you just hope that Trump realizes stepping on everyone was a disaster &amp; at least allows moderator to speak!
Sleezy Biden said he was coming for our guns, ask Beto his gun czar
akjakajaak- sis you kept interrupting both biden and the moderator i wouldn‚Äôt consider that a win ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sir, do you really believe that Russia really cares who wins? Why?  Biden‚Äôs not been incredibly tough on Russia in any official capacity (neither has Trump).  Surely, someone as smart as you realize that Russia just wants us to doubt the election process, regardless of who wins.
Trump continues to attack Hunter Biden and then his son continues to refer to Hunter as Crackhead Biden- yeah, they should make fun of this phony bullshit. If they respected those with addiction, it would be a different story. PS- if you respond, stay on subject: addiction.
You've got to have a better showing than you did on this passed Tuesday. You came across as whiny and childish. Be specific and straight forward with your answers. Let Biden talk without interrupting him or making faces. Then rebut his statement calmly and confidently with facts.

It's not innate. Biden has run nothing but horrible prez campaigns until this. Clinton was the one with the unique blue collar appeal in the 2008 primaries. She made some very bad strategic choices in 2016 and Biden learned from her mistakes.
In many cases there are posers. However, there isn't enough data to know what percentage is or isn't actually Antifa identifiers.   And you're right, they self identify with the idea of Antifa. It's not an organization. Joe Biden, is correct.
It‚Äôs so weird they won‚Äôt just run against Biden. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs the perfect Dem candidate.   It‚Äôs almost like they can‚Äôt figure out how to attack someone who is a straight white Catholic dude.

If Joe Biden wins, he will be the first president in the US that supports tax payer abortions, even up to the moment of birth, and possibly even more than that. That is not Pro-Life in any shape or form.

President Donald Trump opposes changing the rules for the remaining two presidential debates against Democrat Joe Biden, but his campaign says he will still attend.
I live in an urban but white majority precinct in Alabama. The closest thing we have to a hipster area by nat'l standards but still an old guard around. Clinton won 61/35 in our precinct in '16. Literally zero signs. 40+ Biden Harris signs today in yards in a 10 block radius.
You know what Trump didn‚Äôt say? You ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for him.

Biden DID call him xenophobic
Trump is so far from being a white supremacist.  The guy with the racial problem is Biden.
I honestly never knew about Joe Biden's stutter until reading the article from The Atlantic... Since English is my second language, I sometimes stutter when my brain decides to not remember certain words whether they're in Spanish or English. #EH204
I heard from Biden as many policy statements as he could possibly get in, given all #45‚Äôs interruptions.
Dawg what is your target market here ü§£ I hope they bring this up at the next debate so we can here trump and biden finally agree on something smh
First to interrupt was Biden second was Chris Wallace then Trump!
You won the debate based on your zillions of supporters.  You won the debate in spite of Biden lies and no fact-checking by Wallace.
I bet he is! His whole plan was to rattle Biden to make him stutter. But it didnt work.

My prediction is that Biden wins, the GOP doesn't get the spot filled, and Biden gets a "stolen seat" in CA7.
How many times does this president have denounced white supremacy he has done it as far as Charlottesville that I can remember. Enough is enough nobody has pushed Joe Biden on all the racist things he said
He should have already endorsed Biden!

John Roberts, if you had any backbone you would tell everyone that Trump has never supported white supremacy and his actions for minorities has proven it.  Did Biden ever back white supremacist or do any to hurt black persons? I say yes.
I agree with Joy, wholeheartedly.   Joe Biden  does not have to prove himself anymore, he's  running against an IDIOT.
No Fox sucks now! We have heard out President condemn this over&amp; over! When r u idiots going to get Biden to condemn supremacy! Bye bye!

Did you watch the debate? Biden brought up Proud Boys. Watch the clip vs getting your facts from far leaning left outlets. I am a Republican but I refuse to get all my info from Fox. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong w/ this country.
Would love it if whoever it is that Biden picks as his attorney general brought in the SPLC to help evaluate and address all these hate groups and militias.

I have no idea.  Humane Society likes her though.    FWIW, I do get the subtlety of the tweet.
Is that all everyone can say for Biden? He‚Äôs empathetic? Man, I don‚Äôt need him to be empathetic for me. I have family and friends for that! I need a president to watch borders, defend the nation...you know BIG stuff!
I don‚Äôt think Chris Wallace should lose his job. But the bias and deliberate softballs thrown to Biden are impressions many in both sides have voiced. Train wreck.
It is way past time to end the Trump administration, the era of evil, the white supremacist Minority ‚Äúpower‚Äù fa√ßade. Trump supporters represent less than one out of five Americans. We the people must prevail and run this country. vote Biden/Harris, America!
Powerful ad from Joe Biden's team. Thanks, JackBear!
That is the problem the RNC is a petulant at Baby Trump is and hence the reason we need to vote their ignorant failed asses out of office.  I don't believe Biden should participate since Trump follows no rules ever!
Still can't get over how much the debate in some ways resembled an appellate argument gone badly awry, &amp; how well Biden did at end gathering himself--despite taking on personal insults lawyers happily never get at OAs--&amp; delivering an effective close. #appellatetwitter
Spencer can't take "hell no" for an answer?   Biden Campaign responded back August calling Spencer "absolutely repugnant and "your support is 10,000% percent unwelcome here."
Is this because your husband denigrated Joe Biden‚Äôs son in worldwide television. Too late Mel! He made a global disgrace of himself.
Also wanna point out how at the end of the debate, the Trumps looked like business partners and the Biden‚Äôs looked like an actual married couple. Old news tho
But wait, does that then mean that Biden needs to denounce white supremacists since he‚Äôs been endorsed by Richard Spencer?
Joe Biden: if you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black!  Donald Trump: if you don‚Äôt vote for me I got shooters waiting!  Which side you‚Äôre on?
He didn‚Äôt even bring up ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù Biden did.
I can't focus on her because what she is talking about is just the opposite of how her husband attacked Joe Biden on his son addiction. She is who he is.
Omg! Fox reporting is horrible. Now they r pushing h not condemning white supremacy! What about Biden! He supported senator Byrd! He hadn‚Äôt denied anyone if these supremacy groups!
Seriously. How many times does  have to answer this? When will u ask Biden to condemn Antifa&amp; senator Byrd! U r horrible&amp; ur liberal colors are shining bright! We see who is doing the burning! And the white supremacy man in Charlottesville in supporting Biden!
Payments were made to an investment firm, from a person that Trump himself has known for a long time. Not saying it was a setup to try to make Hunter Biden look bad, but that's certainly what it looks like to me.

Dear Mainstream News Media;  can one of you please inquire about the money Hunter Biden took from China,  Ukraine and others?

im convinced that girls are saying they want to fuck biden to seem different
Ah, looking at numbers and then spinning the result.  You lost, because you didn't debate.  Chris wallace treated you like the child you are.  Biden showed what presidential is.  #liarinchief
4 of those voters said they would vote for Joe Biden. 2 said they would vote for Trump. Be better.

The Dems should use the hearings to fill SCOTUS vacancy to relitigate the wrongs and impeachable offenses committed by Trump during the past 3-1/2 years. #alpolitics #OneAlabama #alsen #bidencoalition #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden #BidenHarris2020
3X he interrupted during Trumps 1st rebuttal. Right out of the gate. That ignited the  fire! And Biden was the bully name caller (to the President!) no respect. Bad example for children.
Bruh Biden rlly scared to look trump in the eye

So disappointing the show you put on Tuesday night. Biden interrupted Trump first and then went on to interrupt him 3-1 more times. DO NOT BLAME THIS ON TRUMP Make Biden answer the question and ask him about his racial statements. He actually says things  bad
Spot on, it's the ultimate double bluff, Biden is an obvious patsy candidate and Trump's got the military prepared to 'thank' his voters with a vaccine once elected
Huh. I wonder which reporter will demand Biden respond?

‚Äújoe biden used to ride motorcycles‚Äù
Imagine if during the debate after trump mentioned Biden‚Äôs kids Biden slowly walked up to trump, got nose to nose with him and whispered ‚Äúif you ever talk about my kids again I‚Äôll beat your ass in front of our nation‚Äù.. imagine. Biden would win by a landslide in the polls.
That it takes 60 votes to pass legislation but only 51 votes to vote to allow 51 votes to pass legislation in the senate is really the only argument I need for dissolving the whole institution.
You are high and delusional. Every poll shows Trump losing support and Biden gaining it. Dream on kid.
Joe Biden lies the MSM or debate moderators will never ask him about.
