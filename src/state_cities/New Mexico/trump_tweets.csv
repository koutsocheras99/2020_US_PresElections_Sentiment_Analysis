The only information I have got from Trump in three years is that the water pressure at the white house must be shit.
"One reason Trump supporters believe his lies comes from a basic fact about the brain: it takes more mental effort to reject an idea as false than to accept it as true. In other words, it‚Äôs easier to believe than to not.  So, #MAGA is lazy and dumb.

I think you are underestimating some of the people that follow the GOP and Trump. They truly see the "libs" and the media as their eternal enemy.

yeah - not so much:
TRUMP HAS LOST IT. PERIOD.
speaking of SURPRISES:
I agree Trump will win big, my fear is that with this mail-in voting and problems caused by it, Dems are laying the groundwork to cheat to steal congressional seats and where it doesn't work to make the argument that the election wasn't legit. They will not take it lying down
I hope you're right, but I don't see Biden being able to debate a girl-scout more less stand up with Trump and Kanye and come out looking like anything other than what he is, a man with severe dementia. Unless he is going for those much-coveted "pity" votes.
Aren't you talking about Trump?
You should be directing your B.S. to Trump.
Sadly key players in the narrative are already paving the way for Biden not to debate Trump. From the New York Times to a key person in the Clinton camp. Various reasons but one basic theme. "It's Trump's fault" would you expect any less?

TRUMP closed the boarders when Democrats called him racist. He saved livesDad and I debate over everything from SCOTUS rulings to legislation to the Goldwater rule. We also debate whether John Wayne or Gary Cooper played the better cowboy.   We both think Trump's a disaster. No debate there.
The Republicans don‚Äôt want to fund election security or The Post Office. If Trump pulls this off it takes away the Dems leverage to get the other funding, plus money for states fighting the virus.

It also doesn't change my point: that Trump outflanking Biden /the Dems on the left is something I genuinely fear. That road historically gets really ugly. Since Trump has no principles beyond "get ego boosts and hurt my enemies" it's not a stretch to suspect he may try this.
Fact.  They are running FB ads. Fact. You have to quarantine for 14 days if you go to NYC from anyone of 35 states.
This is exactly the thing I've been fearing: that Trump and his enablers would counter the Dems by implementing economic policies that are now far to the left of that party---and that are desperately needed by millions.

If Virginia was closer than North Carolina that would be bad for Biden. Same if Colorado was closer than Arizona. But neither is currently the case. And again, the reverse of these wouldn't necessarily be good for Trump.
If Texas is closer than Florida, that's bad news for Trump. Same if Ohio is closer than Pennsylvania. Both are the case right now. Note that the reverse result would not necessarily be bad for Biden.
Trump fucking up our lands some more. ‚ÄúPrivatizing campgrounds, changing franchise fee arrangements, rolling back [the National Environmental Policy Act] and air quality regulations, no emphasis on global climate change, not filling positions in a timely and permanent way,"
Fear porn.  Like-minded nations have been coming together for decades.  Trump, however, chooses to withdraw from such gatherings.

Do I think Trump is a total scum bag, YES. But I also feel the same about Biden.
I dont have to prefer either. Many of the outcomes will be similar, the methods will just vary. Trump is an open book, Biden is a typical establishment democrat- Lies and manipulation.  Trump will stab you in the front and Biden will stab you in the back.... Which do you prefer?

What we really need is an executive order that says trump needs to learn how to read

Honestly if youre still a Trump supporter at this point i got mad respect for you. It cant be easy looking like a dumbass having to change your opinion on an issue every single time he does.
The ONLY reason #Obamacare would cease to exists is because trump is trying to kill it! Do you really think the man who said "It is what it is..." about his #TrumpDeathToll162K GAF about pre-existing conditions?! Come on dude, it's in his own words:
But isn't it trump who has paid off families of the children he is accused of abusing?  Oh yes, and quite a few of them!
Mad Dog washed his hands of Trump...
It comes from both sides. You either love him to death or you let him get to you. I'm on neither, because I can care less what Trump does and says. Because it's bs and always blows up back in his face. I just sit back as he destroys himself.

Is this the right picture?  I think this is a picture of the "Losers Club" or the "Dummies Club".  They must think they are immune!  Well, they're not, and when they are sick trump will not help them.
She is a "has been", or a "never was"!  Too many lies do not make her trustworthy any more than trump's multitude of lies make him trustworthy.  trump has no expertise on anything, why in the hell would ANYONE listen to him?
If it were up to trump to give us something from him, we would have a long wait!  The only money that exists is created by we the taxpayers.  He is just trying to seem like a hero when he is nothing but a zero.  WE pay the taxes, he &amp; his friends don't.
HE is doing nothing for us, as usual, and the GOP is certainly not doing anything for us.  So, Trump will pretend to save the day for us, and we will all fall at his feet with joy and decide to vote for the fool.  No thank you.  Whatever we get comes from US, not him.
I thought this was so funny I had ro look it up. Of course it's fake, but it's awesome.
It sounds just like him, and it disgusts me no end.  We get nothing from Trump but "pretend", and I am sick to death of it.  His games are childish, he is stupid and cruel.  I don't know who he thinks he is fooling with his game.

Yeah but if they don't squeeze the people until they scream, they won't be able to blame the Dems and release the money from the damn to win an election. They already blamed Dems for the mounting debt of the Trump tax relief to the rich and now saving zombie and grifting corps.

That‚Äôs an interesting way of looking at it. Compared to Democrat sex-addicts, JFK and Bill Clinton, Trump is probably an angel. Yet, those two are polticians. 45 is a horrible businessman, a racist and the list goes on.

Oh please!  Do you think he will tell the truth when Trump lies on a daily basis?  Trump has hired nothing but sycophants who will do his bidding no matter what?  He should resign!  With the Covid numbers Trump &amp; Pence should also resign.
I want to gag when I see Republicans try to explain why they cannot sign onto the Bill out of the House!  The latest excuse is Dems don't want to compromise.  I'm paying significantly more with Trump's tax cut for the middle class (which it isn't).

1) first get Biden elected; 2) give him some time to clean up the mess trump and his administration left him. After that, maybe you won‚Äôt have to trash him. Looking on the hopeful side.
DUMP trump!!!
Americans always suffer because of Trump.
Your welcome!!!   DUMP trump!!
Thanks, Governor! Wonderful that there‚Äôs someone helping New Mexico businesses and organizations during the Trump Depression/Pandemic.  The current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is AWOL on helping anyone except himself and his corrupt buddies. Never forget: this is the GOP!
And Trump caused a disaster, because he was not paying attention in November,and didn‚Äôt believe it ,said it was gonna be OK ,and if he gets elected ,disaster is going to be a small word compared to what really will happen Bluewave üí™

Trump can at least be clever rather than the pointless projection of the boring, typical lib namecalling:
Just like all the Democratic hoaxes, Trump lies.

Trump moves against Chinese owners of TikTok and WeChat apps
There are a handful of Republicans left in office that aren't just phoning in half-remembered slogans and hate, and Trump is trying to discredit all of them.  Hopefully they will rise again when Trump is in jail or exile. We need a loyal opposition, not whatever this is!

It‚Äôs a bot. He didn‚Äôt type a damn thing.
I forget. Are the governors of  Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Texas Democrats? Oh didn‚Äôt trump equate testing with the virus? Cause if there wasn‚Äôt any testing there wouldn‚Äôt be any cases. That‚Äôs why trump told his people to slow down the testing.
I think it is pronounced Ho-Axe.  It's also worth 14 points in Scrabble, which Trump enjoys playing during his executive time.  He knows all the best Scrabble players.  Only the best.  So much winning.

Trump has been trying to take effective action since Day 1 of his administration and been blocked by Democrat sociopathy to securing TX &amp; AZ from exposure risk of illegal immigration which has been plaguing those States. He can only do so much in face of Democrats‚Äô shenanigans.

Sure you will be and are. Trump before the election was openly racist by refusing to rent to black Americans. Remember the "B" on applications.
If Trump said this people would be burning down cities. But since Biden said it all the extreme leftist (progressives not true democrats) are willing to over look it and say it‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs an accident.

The stupid's always been there, in some proportion ... but it's been steadily rising over a period of a few decades.  Trump would've had no chance in the 80s or 90s.  Not because he doesn't have certain policy/personality appeal, but because the rough edges are *so* rough ...
God since trump elected
Under trump an American dies every 80 seconds from covid. Many of the deaths were preventable. trump politicized mask wearing, called it a hoax, and said it would magically go away. All factors that led to more infections and death. THAT is the crime of the century  RESIGN RESIGN
Maybe Thighland was what Epstein called his island where he and Trump hung out.
After you sat down with Trump in his office ,or actually our office ,your business went to hell,And now you use the word Christ ,shame on you,hang around Trump see where that gets you ,maybe the red caps will buy some from you Bluewave üí™
No, more of a commentary on the fact I coach multiple sports of high school aged kids and that I‚Äôm not going to do it professionally. Psychologists also say that Trump is a malignant narcissist who is limited by emotional and mental intelligence.
trump‚Äôs house BOY!!
Seems to me that loyalty to Trump addles one's brain, and makes someone like Mercedes Schlapp forget what values matter.
Right, Never Trump  means Irrelevant.

Apparently not. Although, to be fair, he‚Äôs ignored much worse behavior where Trump is concerned. The ability to selectively use logic and reason is mind numbing.
I'd probably be tired if I killed God.  I do find it entirely ironic Trump is calling Biden against God and the Bible when he admitted he's never gone to Confession.
trump‚Äôs PET!!

Not really. New Mexico is in a much better place, both in the health of our residents and economically, than most other states. And we can thank  for that! Trump and the Republicans have failed our country by not providing or advocating for a national COVID strategy.
Yes Trump nobody could have ruined the country like you have done!!
John Lewis did not attend Trump's inauguration because he believed as I did and do that Trump was not really elected by the people of the US, but appointed by the Russians who manipulated the vote in 21 Repub states per the Mueller Report subsequently bastardized by Barr!

Yeah. Less junk mail, but also less 1st Class Mail. Trump administration is trying to choke USPS, so everything is slower, and fewer businesses are sending mail out.

As an American I‚Äôm afraid for the first time in my life due to Trumps actions and inactions. There are countless words I could use to describe this man. However, I‚Äôve never been this afraid even after 911. Trump is DANGEROUS.

Trump never watched or cared about an NBA game in his life. And the people who won't watch the NBA now, they were nothing more than casual fans anyway and the NBA will be just fine without all of them.
Yes, the best way to defeat the right is for everybody on the left to shut up and pretend Joe Biden is the second coming, because Biden himself is not giving the Trump team any ammo at all. üôÑ
Trump: my Bible-hurting God-killing opponent hides in his basement, and refuses to debate me. Coward!  Biden:  Trump: Well?  Biden: Sorry, was laughing so hard I snorted my drink up my nose.  America: Same.

When the grand jury indicts you and the trump organization are you going to claim you never heard of it
I can't speak for anyone else, but I've been touting since before Joe was the presumptive, that I plan on pushing him more progressive. I certainly don't consider him anywhere close to divine, false or otherwise. I'm not hanging on his every word like MAGAts do with trump.
Oh shit. This is from Trump. He actually retweeted this. Imma go vomit now.
You‚Äôre right Fred, and Trump should stay out of IT.

Otherwise you'll vote for Trump? Looks like you're just looking for an excuse to do so.
since trump believes testing is a waste all testing needs to stop around trump. If he gets sick and dies oh well, it is what it is. At least he will find comfort in knowing he did all he could do
So if ‚Å¶ can paint #BLM slogans on city streets then people exercising freedom of speech should be allowed to #MAGA2020 slogans on streets as well. That‚Äôs how America‚Äôs democracy works right??

In order for Trump to stop playing the victim, and for his surrogates to stop playing the victim card on his behalf, he would have to take responsibility for his actions.  It'll never happen.

It's not Trump, but rather Republicans up and down the ballot. Not considering if you are giving the opposition ammunition is just not a good strategy. That said, I'm not sure this does give them an issue to use against Dems.
I don‚Äôt think Trump even cares what would be sacrificed. All he cares about are his own personal agendas. Everything else is just in the way.

Trump will drop out.  The reason for a secret convention. GOP promised a statue or a memorial or a trump airport if he drops out. He will say health issues.  A younger candidate may beat Biden based on age.  If this happens, goodbye Supreme Court.

Nothing DEMOCRATS have done in the last ten years have been in the best interests of the black community. 1) Trump is in no way a racist. 2) Most blacks and every one else know's this. 3) Most blacks are DEMOCRATS. 4) All DEMOCRATS have been trying to find a way to deflect truth.

Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
Of course, they are. The guy who runs it now is a Trump crony. Take your ballot to your city clerk or county clerk if you can. If not, put it in the mail 2-3 weeks before Nov. 3rd. Do not wait until the last date.Really sad person and not really all there ... Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

The vast majority of Americans do not subscribe to your lunacy. Trump created a thriving economy along with record low unemployment for minorities and whites. He‚Äôs rebuilt our military and has almost stopped illegal border crossings. He lowered taxes for ALL Americans!
The people accusing Trump of being a racist are going to vote for an actual racist.
Trump just sold me on Biden. Can't vote against someone who can hurt God
Of course, your post is from FAUX News..Trump TV! Get serious! Try fact checking!
Trump voters are motivated by what he campaigned to do and has accomplished. We‚Äôre motivated again to keep him in office and stop the socialist from ruining this country.
Trump/Pence is a disappointment to this country!!
Great idea but I'm not republican I'm I'm libertarian can I still vote in person...I will be voting for Trump if that helps.

It may upset my maga followers but Trump is not a conservative or hell even a Republican on historical standards. He is a populist, nationalist and I'm ok with that and stand strongly in his corner
Mr. Trump,  you don't have the power you think you have.  There is a rule book called the "Constitution."  Read it if you are able to.
Don‚Äôt tell me that Trump doesn‚Äôt have racial influence when a year ago today, a man traveled 10hrs to El Paso to go in and target Latinos, after hearing influence from his anti-immigrant rhetoric and also stating we have a ‚ÄúHispanic invasion‚Äù in the US. #elpasoshooting
This old guy in my town, wore a mask that said "This Sucks".  I'm so proud of that attitude, he acknowledged it does suck but he cares about his community! Sadly not all the older folks act that way. I'm in heavy Trump country (county).

Oh stop. Donald Trump is a dark motive, nothing more. You love Donald Trump because you are filled with the same venomous hatred that he is.
DON'T DO IT! IT'S THE EXACT PATH TRUMP WANTS SO HE CAN CANCEL THE ELECTION! DO NOT BUY INTO HIS MASTER PLAN. PLEASE.
Trump had a shiity family who doesn't know love or empathy. McConnell on the other hand was a demon who created himself to his masters liking. MCCONNELL IS THE MOST EVIL MAN IN AMERICA. I hope he and his wife are exiled after his crimes are revealed.
Welcome to the Trump Train
There‚Äôs roughly 330 million people in the US. With 150,00‚Äù dead that equates to .000454 of the population. US ranks 10th in fatalities of all nations. Considering we are one of the freest nations in the world I would say those are not bad numbers. But of course you blame Trump...
Has the Mayor blamed guns and/or Trump yet?
If this doesn't absolutely secure a win for President Trump, what will?
Believe it or not I am actually deeply sympathetic to Republicans. The top outcome for them is 4 more years of Trump: leading to, I strongly believe, the eventual death of the Republican Party.
*Russia def interferes with election*  Trump: ...........‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶    *teens prob interfere with rally*   Trump: YOU WILL PAY

No bunker just a guy that loves and thinks his country is the best in the world. If you‚Äôre going to support dem‚Äôs then please don‚Äôt talk to me about lies. The dem Party is the most corrupt body ever and that includes Joe Biden. They make Trump look like a kid in the cookie jar.
This is how I see trump and his supporters! They claim Christianity but they are nothing but a herd of sheep! Sheep that he will sacrifice and slaughter when it‚Äôs suits him! Disgusting!
Fucking SAME. Can list a dozen people that would happily turn my liberal ass in when we get to the Gestapo secret police/"anonymous " phone calls that disappear people era of the trump shitshow.
Someone should point this out to the MSM the next time they cry when President Trump talks longer than 5mins in the Rose Garden.
I supported him in 2016 before Trump became the nominee. I'm glad he is able to work w/ the President now. Hope he runs again.
But they also know how temporary their work can be and how that was installed not for men like them but for men like Trump.
True, but we did want to stay home during a pandemic and that is going to impact the economy. I would have rather heard about what % of that could have been spared if the gop had not called it dems new hoax and still acts like it's no big deal, okay per Trump, to risk lives.
This is about auschwitz!! keep that bs in the Biden comments
Just a little food for thought ...... If Biden drops out of his first year that some are predicting the ticket for the democratic party is not: BIDEN/HARRIS or even HARRIS/BIDEN........but  HARRIS/PELOSI   Think about it before you vote......
I hit the wrong button trump all day.  My phone is more broken tjan Biden's grammar.

While I‚Äôm voting the democrat ticket, I must admit I‚Äôm worried about this choice. Biden should‚Äôve picked a woman from a battleground state. California is solidly in the blue corner. I think Duckworth of Ohio might have been a better choice
George Soros' on is happy about kamala hair is smelling good to biden
Given her history, he has a valid point. One way or another, a potential President Biden just decreased his chances of "serving" even one term.

Biden campaign questions. have to wonder whether his campaign staff is better than Hillary Clinton's.
Biden? Obama put Wells Fargo's lawyer, Eric Holder, in charge of DOJ. Could Biden be any worse? I'm thinking, teamed with Harris, MUCH WORSE.
Nobody supports abortion. Much can be done to reduce the number of abortions. Republicans won‚Äôt help because they want to keep it an issue so folks like you won‚Äôt vote for Biden. Democrats‚Äô issue is republicans trying to control women‚Äôs personal choices.
That‚Äôs fine. But them being on the ballot isn‚Äôt a shock or a surprise, or anything to celebrate. M4A, GND, legalization, ending lobbyist corruption- were all BLOCKED from the ballot. Biden is just newer suit for the same bullshit
Lies lies lies. Do you ever speak the truth?

last time Biden had to answer reporters questions, they asked hard hitting things like ‚Äúhow will you maintain your lead in the polls‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do you sleep at night‚Äù. Biden can‚Äôt form a coherent sentence.
I was thinking about the beautiful white haired woman who saw Harris joining Biden as the way that "healing" would come to the US...  I mean, create the sickness then...   She's become the Typhoid Mary of Democrats in my mind.

Biden is the most centrist candidate from any party in decades. But to a conservative today, anything to the left of 'hunting the homeless for sport' is deemed "Marxist". You guys really have no clue what the hell you're talking about, do you?
Sure, Trump is the vulgar unwrapped face of this system. He‚Äôs not an anomaly or a one-off. He is the gross representation of American politics. All Biden does is take some of the vulgarity out. It‚Äôs just a costume change.
Biden is a mouthpiece, not real credibility.   I'm with you, I'm not buying it.  !!!
Biden has experience and a deep, powerful compassion and empathy. Harris is a light saber that can cut through chromium. So, yes, I believe they can unify our country.

It was Biden's hostility to consumers, and coziness with both predatory lenders and credit card companies that prompted Warren to get involved with politics in the first place.
While I generally agree with you, I don't think the research has caught up to COVID, which may drive a record number of people to vote by mail. Those who are more science and evidence-based are likely to vote for Biden and vote by mail due to concerns with social distancing, etc.
Disappointed by #WFP endorsement of Biden.  There are few Democrats whose records and policies lie further from the stated goals of WFP than his.
He hailed the California senator as the right woman to help him defeat Trump and then lead a nation facing crises in triplicate: a pandemic, wounded economy and long-simmering reckoning with systemic racism.
She will be.  We were just 'gun shy' after seeing what Hilary went through last time around.  Joe Biden is teeing up the first female President.

Contenders 4 VP were good, but lots of practical politics involved. Was confident that final choice would be great ( Kamala: tough woman - drive DT nuts with her knowledge &amp; skill) &amp; others wld find powerful positions in the Biden admin. Liz 4 Maj Lead!!! Rice 4 Sec of State!!üëç
IMO, the only thing working against Sen Harris is that she'd taken a campaign contribution from then-civilian Donald Trump. Inasmuch as he has claimed to be GOP-ish in his politics, and she is a person of color and the child of immigrants, I was astounded.
Kamala will not let them get away with anything. She speaks up for the rule of law and for the rights of others. She will run circles around Pence at the debates and Kamala brings fire to the Biden ticket. Great pick
In Kamala Harris, a Choice at Once Safe and Energizing
Biden will not cut Social Security. The Democrats will not cut Social Security. If anything they will expand it. Where do U get that? The only people looking 2 cut Social Security (+ Medicare) are GOP &amp; the right. After Biden is elected &amp; serves, will U admit U were wrong?

Conservatives are actually trying to make the case that Biden wants to enforce Sharia Law.
Repubs will vote for Biden. Whites will vote for Harris.    Since "Progressive" means anyone but Trump.
Biden could have picked his nose and I would still vote for him and the booger.
Biden's choice of a Black woman for VP is historic. It could also help him win.
Shameful that we again nominate a weak candidate that wants the status quo. Biden wants to strengthen Obamacare: A failed Republican plan that is responsible 4 ppl dyingbc they can‚Äôt afford insurance, going bankrupt even w/ ins. or doing without meds! That is shameful!
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate in historic first for a woman of color
So sry.  Given state of country I need to vote for Biden even without a vegetable running mate.  I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs a spot in cabinet:  Turnip for Sec of Agriculture!!! Who could be better!!
Ummmmm, you do realize that Joe Biden is Catholic, don't you?
Kamala: She called Biden an "old white racist", got schooled by  , had horrible reaults in the Dem primaries, besties with #JussieSmollet , and Biden has better support with the black community than she does.  not sure why she was picked.
Even better if you do % increase, which is more relevant than raw #s: Obama/Biden +118% Trump/Pence +40%. Not that stocks are representative of economy for most, but everyone does better under Dems. Consistently
Attacking #KamalaHarris as being far left is absurd (just like attacking Biden for being far left is). Just look at Far Left US twitter if you have doubts.
Hahahaha‚ÄîGOP whining about fiscal responsibility as Trump runs up biggest deficits in American history‚Äîincluding before COVID (after Obama/Biden had brought down W‚Äôs deficits...and Clinton brought down Reagan/Bush deficits). Hahahaha
If Kamala stood up and apologized for her past poor judgment and explained how she has changed and why.  And, if I believed her &amp; she said she is for #M4All  I would consider it.  I believe Biden will not be pres for long.. due to his declining health.

Even kamala believes biden's accusers
I mean....... I don't see a world in which Biden lets anyone dismantle homeland security. Obama didn't even close Gitmo
Really? And can you in good conscience let Trump destroy whatever degree of democracy we have left? I would recommend to mull over this and imagine the two outcomes‚ÄîBiden or Herr Drumpf‚Äîand then make your choice.
Biden picking Harris is like Bush and Cheney all over again.
I ordered my Biden Harris yard sign already! Let‚Äôs do this!
Biden/Harris 2020! This is going to be amazing!
Congratulations Senator Kamala Harris  for partnering with Vice President Joe Biden  and completing the winning ticket - #BidenHarris2020!
Rump is giving a news conference at 5:30. This should be a hoot! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!
Gotta say, I had a premonition of this. Maya Harris (sister/campaign mgr.) is VERY close with the Clintons, and I can guarantee you that if Biden wins, he‚Äôll soon have a ‚Äúmedical incident‚Äù and Kamala will announce HRC as VP.
Her endorsement meant a lot to me, and I will do everything I can to ensure President Biden and the first ever woman of color Vice President Harris are elected this November.

The Biden/Harris administration will be the most progressive in American history--tough &amp; compassionate can go together.   #BidenHarris2020 #BlackLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter #tuesdaymood
I have faith that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will focus on cleaning house. We will all have to focus on what makes an equitable and functioning society.  Yippee!!
One thing that impressed me about Biden‚Äôs choice of Harris is that it shows he‚Äôs a guy who can take criticism from others ‚Äî unlike certain obnoxious narcissists we all know
Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate - ABC News
Better than that vulture Jamie Dimon, who is reportedly on Biden's short list.
There is a large faction of the DNC that is still doing absolutely everything to oppose Sanders.   Remember, Biden's hostility towards consumers &amp; coziness w/predatory lenders &amp; credit card companies is what got Warren into politics in the first place.
üó≥Ô∏è Biden/Harris all the way.

Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party‚Äôs presidential ticket.
Biden/Harris yard is ordered!
joe biden does not respect harris or any other black person in his heart
Looks like I won't be voting for Biden. Nor Trump. Nor Kanye. Nor Mikey Mouse. I frankly have no opinion on the matter one way or the other. Too abstract and removed from everyday life.  "Dust in the wind. All we are is dust in the wind. Oooooo ahhh..."
Indeed. Biden is not much different than digging up the corpse of Ronald Reagan. Adding a self-described "top cop" to the ticket doesn't exactly improve the stench.
Biden should have picked  as his running mate.
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate

i don‚Äôt understand why everyone thinks biden would announce before trump‚Äôs press conference so he can steal the news cycle by saying something crazy
#JoeBidenIsAPedo   joe biden's wife should keep her creepy husband away from little girls.  Shame on her!
Jill Biden, a Natural Beauty.
People are going to be shocked when Biden goes with the Miami Gillums instead of the Cleveland Kasichs.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has landed a prime speaking slot at next week's Democratic National Convention, on the same evening as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden's VP pick:  via  #nmpol
Biden‚Äôs base takes his comments seriously, not literally
‚ÄúNews organizations should be constantly asking themselves, ‚ÄúHow are stories framed? What language is used? Are we reinforcing unconscious stereotypes?‚Äù #nmpol #BidenVP
A mirror for the Democratic Party. It‚Äôs not like Biden won the Primary by popular vote, my vote was irrelevant as it was dedcided before I even voted in the a Primary.
Good Ol Boy Definition - Elite Club Rots as Empire Crumbles -
Biden said several weeks ago he wanted to be the transition president. Old guard replaced by new energy, younger people, and fresher ideas.
All this talk about the Biden #VPPick, I‚Äôm wondering when  will announce his  pick.
the GOP must own their failure to save us from a Depression. If McConnell is the majority leader he will obstruct President Biden at every turn. Voters must be made to understand why it is imperative to send Democrats to Congress and not only the WH.
really? clearly Biden supporters have Biden mentalities.
All these dominoes will have fallen before the end of the week. It is the only way, and I would not take a bet on the Spring sports, either, unless VP Biden wins. And by then, we will have 300,000 dead, with no good reason
In other words: both Trump and Biden are terrible candidates. Both are thin-skinned, combative, compulsive liars, and both are guilty of rampant nepotism in  service of their hideous children.
And Biden's considering him as Secretary of the Treasury?If Biden had chosen Tulsi it would‚Äôve been a total game changer, but you know
Every candidate who has run on the campaign "at least I'm not the other guy" has lost. My fear w/ a Biden win would be neolibs saying "see this strategy works!!! Now we must only elect neolibs" &amp; the one upside to a Trump victory would be the concession that that strategy sucks
That explains why Biden is basically dominating.
And China and Iran will elect Biden/Harris
Wow. This election really opened my eyes to who ppl really are. The fact that the left cancelled every other candidate for a perv like Biden who doesn't even care about quality healthcare during a pandemic, I don't think we can ever really look at the left the same ever again.
I am the sick and the poor. I am %100 against trump, but I know a Biden presidency is going to do very little to help me. If we are not critical of the establishment then nothing will change.
Let me remind you that it‚Äôs an opinion from January.  But here‚Äôs the thing: nominating a candidate like Biden will make it far more difficult to defeat Trump. It will allow Trump to muddy the water, to once again pretend he is the one ‚Äúdraining the swamp‚Äù.
Hey Joe Biden can you be the bigger man and give your condolence to Donald Trump his brother died
I agree. They need Biden-Harris. Biden will call them ‚Äúsuper predators‚Äù and Harris will seek longer sentences for cheap slave labor. Go 13a!
Doubt it. It‚Äôs more likely these racist organizations support Biden. At least Biden is open about his racism. Why aren‚Äôt you?
It‚Äôs narrow minded to always go back to Hillary, Obama, Benghazi, H. Biden. Maybe you should find your info elsewhere. Read some foreign news, Reuters, BBC, etc. You should be able to get the idea what is going on here. Check your news sources, be media savvy.
Going after Biden‚Äôs son is pathetic and weak. Pay attention what is happening in WH.
I wonder if the editorial board will make the sensible decision to endorse Joe Biden when the time comes.
#votestupidout The Donald says Biden is a far-left radical socialist‚Äù¬†who will¬†‚Äúdestroy America.‚Äù¬†But how Biden can be both mentally deficient and an evil genius has not been explained.
See even there I'm pretty cool with it. I personally prefer Biden to Bernie (another conversation entirely) but it seems in AFT's best interest for DeVos to not be Secretary of Education lol
Biden has two signs in this town. Trump has a naval invasion.
You would vote drumpf over Biden? I'm a Bernie supporter as well but we only have 2 choices.
And the brown Burqueno vs The orange,POTUS rally is going on at my house pretty much 24/7. VOTE Biden/Harris!!
Kamala Harris is Joe Biden's handler to make sure he doesn't fuck up ü§£ you know it's true, also Biden will be a placeholder President and out of office faster than he can remember what year it is and replaced with of course the cop
so let me get this straight Bernie gave up the run for president and gave it to f****** Biden and still got all of us resistors to vote for Biden and because you guys think Sanders still owes Joe f*** you
Please let me know what I personally can do to help Joe Biden.
As kids we learned building the sandcastle took smarts, initiative+effort while any punk brat could kick it down. The #AntifaTerrorist + #BLM filth rioting+destroying property are those punk brats. Where is #Biden to condemn it? #LawAndOrder #KAG2020 #KAG #CNN #ABCNews #CBSNews
Been a sec since i've had a Hot Take that pissed off all my followers so here we go: compared to past presidents, Biden is far from bad. He's much more progressive than many past prez's. Compared to what's possible and what we should expect from a leader, he's absolute dogshit.
"But it's important we don't spread false/dangerous ideas about COVID"   yeah, I agree, but it's ultimately about precedent. If that's ok, then its ok to fact check any opinion.   "Joe Biden's bad because of his racist past" gets fact checked bc "He says he's changed." and so on
All Aboard the Malarkey bus with Slow Creepy Joe and Phony Kamala Harris!   Joe thinks he's going out for an ice cream cone as Kamala sits in the driver's seat, as the "Ridin' with Biden Fun Bus" stalls on the tracks!  image vis
It does seem messed up &amp; she ruined ppls' lives, but between her, Biden, &amp; Trump, she seems the most reasonable of all. At least she doesn't have allegations or sniffs children in public or flirts with kids on elevators.
Joe Biden said that if it was his choice that he wanted to vote for Trump. KamAla had him dragged back stage and flogged. At which time all CNN, ABC, MSNBC EVEN Fox red camera lights went off
Could you imagine the f****** s*** Biden has to go through to get our country back on on track  thanks to Trump all the s*** that this man has caused it's going to be taking a lifetime of work
I'm donating to Lincoln Project and I think Joe Biden should revoke his offer to Kamala Harris and ask E.Warren to join the ticket! It's not too late!
Does fighting for what's right include her accusing you of sexual molestation of numerous women? And believing you are a racist? But then 'forgetting' it when her shot at power came? #Biden2020 #kamalaHarrisisafraud #NYT #CNN #MSNBC #FoxNews #ABCNews #CBSNews #NBCNews #Biden's VP
You could not be more wrong if you tried. It‚Äôs Biden/ Harris who will tear down Democracy, and usher in Autocratic government control of all aspects of our lives
Biden can drive and ride a bike.  Donnie can‚Äôt even navigate a ramp or a glass of water.  So there‚Äôs that.
"Biden 2020: Settle for Salmonella"
Idek what people mean tbh when they say biden is center right and trump is far right. They just mean left=good, center=neutral, right=bad. And I agree, trump is bad, and biden is worse than neutral, but their platforms are a hodgepodge from the political spectrum.
Not sure Biden will remember the answers pre-approved questions.  I guess if he can't remember, Kamala will jump in.
No help to trump , elect Biden to get rid of trump virus
Biden!!  To a T
My experience with racists is that they are never subtle. We have 8 years of watching Biden and no one can fake it that long.
I check myself all the time and still sometimes I screw up. Joe Biden has screwed up too but a racist would never work for Prez Obama and love him like he does. If he were a racist, he couldn‚Äôt fake the admiration and affection he has for Kamala. Of course you know this.
Hey McCarthy you already gave tax breaks to ALL your friends! ............And we want it back! It belongs to us not your freakin republican friends! You bet I'll vote for Biden and get this rot and ruin out of the white house, fumigate big time!
Topics to be discussed:  1. Veepstakes  2. Biden's running mate selection  3. Pros and cons of contenders for running mate  4. Importance of VP choice to campaign
Guess what?  This wasn‚Äôt a press conference.  Unlike Trump, Biden doesn‚Äôt feel the need to talk and talk at all times.  Even when Trump has his ‚Äúso-called‚Äù press conferences, he lies.
2. Hell after Biden bragged about being in South Africa, I wonder if there isn't something to the Mandela effect
You should accept the recall. You let #BLMAntifaTerroristsThugs take over #Seattle alienated the  &amp; businesses are leaving the city in droves. I guess if Biden wins you won‚Äôt be hired to run Urban Renewal, but Yakima needs a dog catcher. #MAGA2020 üá∫üá∏#BlueLivesMatter

She dropped out early because she knew she was going to be Biden‚Äôs pick. Both were INSTALLED. Empty vessels the Cabal can use to do their bidding!!!!
Why is that if I don't want to vote for Biden, it means that I want to vote for Trump? I can assure you that I wouldn't vote for either

Good people doing good things for good people who find themselves screwed. VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS!!
BIDEN AND HARRIS ARE POLICE STATE GOP TRASH
well I qualify as an "old person" and am Biden/Harris all the way.
In addition, many of those trolls liked to assert that the governor was doing this in order to secure Biden‚Äôs invitation to be VP. Now that Kamala got the nod, we can expect them to shake off the delusions and start thinking rationally, right?
Reasons Trump stays out of jail  Re-elected and abolishes voting in second term. Counts on Biden not prosecuting him and his toadies. Dies.  Any other reasons I‚Äôm missing?

The pick of Kamala Harris as VP shows the dem party is trying put a neo liberal strangle hold for the next 8 years.  So if Trump wins none of those policies see the day of light. If Biden wins those policies dont see the light of day.
Trump‚Äôs team has gotten more done for all Americans and even the world in four years than most ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù politicians have in a lifetime of politics.  And the left offers Biden/Harris as a better pick than Trump/Pence?  #NM4Trump #MAGA #KAG
If anyone votes for Trump, despite his actions in office, solely because both parties want to play football, then they were never actually voting for Biden in the first place. They were just looking for an excuse to vote for Trump (again?).

That‚Äôs what given me hope‚Äîthat, his personal friendship with the Obamas, who I‚Äôm sure are counseling him and Dr. Biden,  and the way he appears to be using his personal losses as a means of connecting to the grief and loss of Americans affected by all this.
and Biden avoids questions all together so what‚Äôs your point?  Why don‚Äôt you print that you hack.
Strange. Biden and Harris just made a nationwide mask mandate. Sleepy Joe said it was for 3 months, minimum.
I am excited for, but not prepared for, the war between the elites and the people. I worry that Biden exists only to hide it, while Trump exists to start it. I also worry I am not ready for what Trump will start. I am however, ever ready to die for the cause I believe in. Forever
We need to draw the battle lines  War has become so hard to distinguish in our time, that we spend all our time discussing that drawing.  We must draw them and move on to preparing the battle  Here. see the NYPD supporting Trump    The position is against!
Joe Biden once did a  autocomplete interview and one of the questions was "does joe biden know how to code" and then it jump cuts to the next question and I really wanna know what he said that was so bad that Wired refused to air it
Idk.... I use a hose on cars that have Obama Bumper stickers..... I would prey on Biden stickers bit I haven't found any
She flips more than Hillary Clinton.  She changes her culture identity more than Elizabeth Warren.  She has loose morals and no ethics.  She believes Joe Biden is a racist and sexual assaulter of women yet, she is proud to run with him.  I'll have to take a pass on this BROAD.
Way to go   I stand with the blue as well because 'All Lives Matter'.      NYPD union endorses Trump: ‚ÄòWe need your strong voice across the country‚Äô
Another who died in office was Henry Harrison, my favorite president. Who, in his old age, decided to give his inauguration speech without a jacket to show his virility. He contracted pneumonia and died in a month.  Biden is neither, and Kamala is no Harry Truman. She can be good
I don't mean this as an attack on Biden's health. May he live as long as he sees fit. But, previous dead Presidents include Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had the great Henry Wallace replaced with the failed Harry Truman. Wallace was replaced to further the fascist corporate goal
Biden is gonna off Biden before long if we're serious. He is a dying man, and as much as he might want to hide it (not sure how much that is) it is clear that he is not long for this world.  Only a few Presidents have died in office of natural causes and I look forward to it soon
Donald Trump is making the world worse faster than it can be made better. I don't expect Joe Biden to be an unadulterated agent of good, but I do expect him to make the world degenerate into chaos as fast as he possibly can. I don't want politics to be about getting high ratings.
I want Joe Biden to be president so I can go back to enjoying and watching pop culture rather than dreading and watching politics. Not so I can so I can stop working to make the world a better place, but so I can do it calmly and positively instead of in a state of panic and fear
I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt be sniveling like a coward if they had picked Biden #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020
‚ÄúWhat does Joe Biden even stand for? Can he even stand?‚Äù -
Lmao. No. I'm no lib either. I was a lib up until this election, &amp; I saw that the left cancelled every candidate for basically a child sniffer. I honestly feel that Trump is perverted, so it wouldn't make sense for me to support Biden as if he's also inculpable.
I truly believe one of Biden's biggest hurdles moving forward are his supporters.
"Should we believe women who were sexually assaulted by biden?" "It was a debate LOOOOOOL"

You're kidding, right? You may not be crazy about Biden, but voting for someone else, or not voting at all, is the same as casting a vote for Trump. This is a defining moment for our country. No candidate is perfect, although, compared to Trump, almost anyone might seem to be so.
Yes Harris is awful in sooo many ways but because she‚Äôs neutral (almost conservative really) she is the best option for biden to beat trump. If you don‚Äôt vote for biden because of harris,  you‚Äôre then voting for trump.

Damn y‚Äôall, I don‚Äôt know whether to be happy that the army of social media armchair infectious disease specialists are now political analysts or not. The browbeating has begun, as if Joe fucking Biden is our lord and savior. F**k you, vote blue no matter who.

We can't let Trump or his cronies getaway either. Biden should hand it over to international courts and the Hague.
WRONG!! The richest people in America would see their taxes go up under a Biden/Harris presidency! You telling these lies that are easy to debunk isn‚Äôt helping your Orange Fuhrer!

Remember, Biden had aneurysms in the late 80‚Äôs. No wonder he can‚Äôt function.
If you really hate this shit you need to get out there and demand voting rights, support the USPS and condemn the entire GOP for their fascist and authoritarian power grab. Support Biden/Harris. Anything less is BS.
People aren‚Äôt aware that Biden has a couple of brain aneurysms in the late 80‚Äôs. Wikipedia said it could affect his functionality.
You don‚Äôt. When rumors that Biden was going to pick Beto out of the gate were circulating, us Beto supporters were pissed off. Rightfully so. She hadn‚Äôt even decided she wasn‚Äôt running and the media was hounding her as to whether she would take VP.
Again, eloquently breaks down Trump‚Äôs attack on USPS, defers question about VP pick to Biden team, says Joe will make the right choice, redirects back to voter suppression. This is the interview she‚Äôs been giving since early June.
President Joe Biden!
It doesn't matter we're coming for him and he's not going to stop us! Joe Biden and the American people will claim the victory!
Literally she did almost every show in the week leading up to the VP announcement and refused to talk about it. She referred all questions about it to the Biden campaign and redirected to say she was proud to work with Joe on voter suppression and census.
I watched every show too. Since the ONE interview months ago where she responded to everyone shredding her capabilities and experience for months by standing up for herself by saying she would be an excellent running mate, she has answered with referring all questions to Biden.
Girl, what? She redirected every question about being on the VP shortlist back to talking about fighting voter suppression and the census every time. I could literally post every interview here to prove it. She said ‚ÄúI refer all questions about that to the Biden campaign‚Äù.

Harris hates bananas! Harris wants to kidnap your children! Biden hates cars! And the sky! And shoes!
They didn't retract. They just said that only people who are voting for Biden can shit on him. Lotsa liberals got radicalized by BLM but they apparently need more time to really understand that electoralism will never be what they want it to be.
82 days until we elect Joe Biden the 46th President of the United States. 82 days until we elect Kamala Harris the first female Vice President in American history.
I feel like that question is going to be a question thats going to be repeated ALOT over the next few years as his VP pick takes over his seat since Biden knows hes a transitionary candidate

GOP has generally denied science and sought to prioritize private interests over national health. Saying that Biden was wrong about the virus is ridiculous. Trump was in the chair and did NOTHING!
This lie started floating before Biden even made a decision.
LOL...you‚Äôre really saying Biden is ignoring facts &amp; science about the virus while your Orange Fuhrer is touting hydroxychloroquine, injecting people with disinfectant, and saying the virus will just disappear? You might want to rethink the lies you tell!

The people did not pick Biden tho. Nobody, not the far left or the actual democrats, is happy about him being the other choice. Him and trump are one in the same
For yesterday's Biden/Harris speeches, they used Teleprompters set to the left &amp; right, the way you would w/an audience; not directly ahead, as normal for a purely broadcast address. I thought it was effective, and I suspect that's what they're planning for convention speeches.
You‚Äôre mistaken. If they win, Kamala will run the White House. That‚Äôs why Biden‚Äôs selection was so crucial.
I keep seeing libs who view this as a great thing "Oh, Biden's gonna win in a landslide because people hate Trump" but it's actually a very damning indictment. If at any point, for whatever reason, voters start to feel neutral towards Trump, Biden loses over half his support.
In order to win this election we are going to need moderates, independents, and even conservatives to vote for Biden. That may mean having a convention that is inclusive. While to use dems it may seem odd, I guarantee it is a well thought out strategy to widen appeal.

I get it, I really do. We can comb through the dirty baggage that Biden and Kamala have accrued. But look at what the opposition is! Yes we need to constantly critique and hold our leaders accountable but in the face of 4 years of more disaster, we need to unify.

Biden did say Harris "would be ready to LEAD the first day".  Sounds like he won't be around long if he wins.
i mean people have been speculating they're going to withdraw Biden so this isn't surprising
If they are already questioning her parents nationality-they recognize she is a real threat to their power.    Someo who questions Harris or Biden‚Äôs qualifications for the jobs they seek entirely lacks credibility.    Important to remember-no dirty trick to low for republicans

Dems are in a bad position with the electoral college. It takes more blue votes to get a dem in office than for repubs. To win we have to show up in big numbers. Even a tiny fraction of the vote splitting is how we got Trump. So yes, no vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
We're living in Russia right now....next stop...Belarus....barr will sanction that...jean pirro is inviting assassination of Joe Biden......maybe it will backfire

In what world do you see suburban housewives...voting for you??    Your childish behavior, name calling, lying and spreading fake news...only serves to show how unfit you are for president.    Biden and Harris...will get the job done!!!
This kind of herd mentality is why political parties will never improve, they know that no matter what they do or who they select that their members will support them no matter what, even if they had said they hated them before. Dems went from hating Harris &amp; Biden to loving them
Your little cartoon is belittling to the least.  If your the train...full of hot air and running on the backs of others.  At least you dhow Biden actually doing the work and that is why Biden will win for President.  He doesn't name call, point fingers or whine about news.

I would rather not see Biden‚Äôs old wrinkly face next to her.
Don't get me wrong, Biden and Harris aren't an ideal choice either.   But the presidency (in its current state) is nothing more than a symbol and I would much rather NOT have 4 more years of symbolic fascism.  Instead we can spend the next 4 years doing two things:
There‚Äôs #hope again for real #leadership at the federal level. The future is bright with #BidenHarris2020!
Lol someone said they would rather not vote at all...because voting for Biden means "8 years of non-progress" (this person obviously forgot a term is only 4 years) and that they'd rather see the Green Party thrive.  Isn't that how we got stuck with Trump to begin with...?

Wayne Dupree: The Joe Biden-Kamala Harris Ticket Inspires ‚Äî No One!  via
Right, so Biden played it safe in terms of leaning hard right (for Dems) and consolidating his whole ticket behind corporatocracy and oligarchy, showing his true colors. SMH Do you think he cares about racial justice, equality and trans rights? He doesn't even support UHC.
Right, I think Warren is enough of a Bernie protege for me to go for that. She was my easy second pick in the primary. And Biden could have done himself a favor in rallying the progressives behind him for November in her, but man he screwed dat pooch.
It's the same people who justify Biden's you ain't black comment.
Who‚Äôs Joe Biden...and what‚Äôs a Kamala?
I have a feeling a lot of those accounts saying they‚Äôre not voting for Biden are Bots, a lot of fakes out of Russia trying to divide the Democratic Party the way Trump has divided America!
Trump has already ‚Äúswayed‚Äù me to vote for Joe Biden.
My take is that the country survived the civil war and it will survive Trump. In a way we're actually still fighting the civil war, this being divided by racism. Under Biden that might all get swept under the rug again, protests and support for the protestors might go away.
In 2016, Putin used "Pro-Clinton" ads to discourage voters and widen political divisions. So if an account looks suspect, report it, even if it is promoting Biden/Harris.
Biden got his Pokemon hoping to win the election. You know she is just being used right? People complain about talking about grabbing by the pussy, Biden actually does it.
Oh boy, Biden is thinking about little girls. What a sicko...
Today's Word of the Day is rodomontade.
Biden/Kamala don‚Äôt care about Americans, so that would be just fine with them!
This young man has good points why to vote Biden/Harris even when they were not your first choices. Many of us had to compromise. I‚Äôm happy with this compromise though
Yeah, they said it was content i chose not to see, lol i was like im not Biden you cant make my decisions for me
This, as we were told repeatedly during the primary, is a 100% legitimate reason to refuse to vote for a candidate. Therefore it's pretty clear that anyone who wants to get mad at Bernie supporters for refusing to vote for the toxic Biden/Harris ticket is virulently anti-Semitic.
Boost not requested.  Fuck Joe Biden anyway.
I doubt the Sleazy, Creepy, Slimy Biden knows what denounce means
All y‚Äôall that are hating so hard on Biden/Harris seemed to forget that none of y‚Äôall showed up to the polls on Super Tuesday. We could have had Bernie running against trump if we had just turned those tweets into action, shit bums me out.
Only the most ignorant or the greedy will buy this drivel. Biden/Harris is out now and the difference is startling-just Joe and Kam being who they are is a mortal blow to Trump/Pence...with or without Mother, Pence does not want to debate Harris...
I'm glad you mentioned that.  I would love to see the citation for Biden going after Social Security.  I know he has said he will veto Medicare For All if it's not fiscally responsible, but Medicare is not Social Security.

Why not reserve the Deleware gym for mid-September and challenge Joe Biden to a debate?  Ask 2 TV stations to show up.  Limit the number of people who can attend.

Cajoling definitely won't suffice.  I've looked at your timeline, and surmise (and respect) that you believe nothing will suffice with them.  Since, this year, the least bad outcome will be Biden and Harris in the white house, I hope something else will suffice for now.
I've got to be honest, it's probably better that you don't. It's up to you of course... But at this point asking anyone to vote for Biden and kamala is like telling us to commit  sepuku. So much for being for the people.

Biden picking Harris was the right choice for a VP and you guys claiming it'll make our current situation with the police worse is close minded as fuck.
Biden 2020! You know how I feel about 45.
If Biden wants my vote, it‚Äôs important to me that he not be Donald Trump. What‚Äôs that? Kamala? Even better.
People on my timeline seriously saying Biden/Harris arent good and so they wont vote. You're a moron. You seriously look at Harris a woman of color and say "Shes going to make things worse" as if the man in pffice hasnt been making it worse for the past four fucking years
‚ÄúThe process for picking Harris was another sign of a (surprisingly) well-run campaign‚Äù
‚ÄúThat the VP pick did not leak is a feat unto itself for a presidential campaign. Nearly every vice presidential pick in past years has leaked.‚Äù
Cured Covid Hams! Today...A Russian vaccine? Would you take it? Dr Barry Ramo at 5P to discuss...Plus, Biden‚Äôs Kamala Harris VP pick. The show starts at 3P on 96.3 News Radio KKOB
Hahah the guy who is intentionally mispronuncing names and is saying that Biden picking a women is sexist, isn‚Äôt a ‚ùÑÔ∏è. The people complaining about wearing masks aren‚Äôt ‚ùÑÔ∏è. People bitching that they want college football back but don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs safe aren‚Äôt ‚ùÑÔ∏è. You‚Äôre ALL ‚ùÑÔ∏è
‚Äúthe historic nature of a Harris pick will likely overshadow qualms progressives have with her on policy.‚Äù
‚ÄúDemocrats see her questioning of Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings as a strength, not a weakness.‚Äù
Joe Biden acts like a plantation owner!
Move over Hillary, Biden is about to become the newest "Most mythologized living person" now
‚Äòwith this pick, Biden showed that people around him shouldn't be afraid to speak out, that it won't get someone thrown under the bus or "canceled."
‚ÄòWhat's also notable is that Harris is seen as a "safe" pick. That's because she's a known quantity, has already been vetted during the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and is disciplined.‚Äô
Breaking:  trump learned of this disclosure and that Biden chose Kamala Harris while on his golf course...he promptly over filled his Depends...
I just got an email asking me to participate in a Biden focus group. So I did.
President Obama hardly ever said "trust me" when people questioned his intent;  he would say "keep me honest".  And those of us on the left side that elected him didn't do enough to keep him honest.  I want Biden/Harris elected, and I want us to watch them and keep them honest.
Harris wants U.S. to give Americans $2,000 a month during pandemic, a contrast with Biden‚Äôs measured approach      Real help from #BidenHarris2020.  All you want to do is help your rich friends.
Biden and Harris is just plain scary
Hard pass. I‚Äôll be watching the winning ticket - Biden/Kamala.
Liberals: We don't want a progressive candidate! We'll push Biden left to secure the leftist vote!  Leftists: okay. Let's see it.  Biden: OINK OINK WE THE PIG PARTY NOW SQUEEEAAAAL! FUCK YOUR HEALTHCARE PLANS!  Liberals: This can only be the fault of the leftists!
well said
wondering how many times biden will even get to see harris in person this fall
WATCH LIVE: Biden and Harris make 1st appearance as running mates in Delaware
Biden makes his pick  #NewsRadioKKOB #BrandonVogt
Let‚Äôs be real, anybody who says they won‚Äôt vote for Joe Biden because of his VP pick wasn‚Äôt going to vote for him in November anyway.
Why Biden picked 'fearless fighter' Kamala Harris as his running mate
And what's scary to think about is that if Biden becomes president and then he cloaks out while president, she will become president. üò®
The country needs mature, responsible leadership to pull us out of this ongoing disaster ‚Äî and Kamala Harris will help Joe Biden deliver it ---- EVERY SMART EXECUTIVE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE TEAM YOU BUILD AROUND YOU.  via
Congrats Senator Harris.  Together, Joe Biden and Kamala will bring our country back!   What a great team!
The systems that Biden helped create?
I knew Kamala  would be Biden's choice; I'm so happy!!!!!
Kind of expected it, altough Caiifornia would have propably gone to Biden anyway. Kubachar or Wilson would have better.
You do actually have to choose between empathetic and intelligent humans, or Biden/Harris.
Remember the inauguration when Secretary Clinton &amp; Barack Obama demonstrated strength, grace, &amp; class attending? Does anyone think for a sec Trump will attend Biden's inauguration?  #TrumpIsASoreLoser
No,we need these debates,Biden gaffes and Trump bullshitting stupidity,all out there. Biden will be ready but Trump is going to chicken out. Just a matter of when and what excuse Trump will use.
I think a lot of people are completely oblivious to what the democratic party has transformed into the last 4 years. They think it's still the first Obama/Biden ticket
Love the fact that you tweeted Biden and Harris, as if they care one whit about what a tin horn like you thinks.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
The biggest indictment on Biden voters is that every time  replies to one of bidens tweets they never realize it's a bot and start trying to insult and attack the 'person'.
Democratic nominee Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his Vice President, so what does that mean for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham who was considered for the job? Could a cabinet seat be in her political future?
Just this is enough to get my vote:  When asked why she was so mean to Joe Biden in the first debate, Kamala Harris laughed and said, ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS  POLITICS.‚Äù Right she is. If you want to play the hardest game in the world, you better be tough.  via
Biden could‚Äôve picked someone with a lower profile or less Washington experience, aomeone he could control better. She‚Äôs not that; not by a mile. This is a real breakthrough. To those of us who‚Äôve watched the world topple women while men soar on, unimpeded, it matters.
My amazing governor  Michelle Lujan Grisham just showed up like the badass she is on msnbc üî•üî•and I gotta say, it‚Äôs quite impressive that she was the only LatinX person on Biden‚Äôs short list. So proud üòÅüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Doesn‚Äôt help Biden/Harris"  fuck helping public servants.  Trump is awful and needs to go.  anyone is better.  i feel sorry for anyone who actually thinks Biden is THE BEST choice to be president, cause he is just the best over Trump.  Biden is too old and out of touch to lead.
I‚Äôm not saying it is. Dark fox is saying that Biden won‚Äôt even make it a full term before dying, insinuating his old age as a factor. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs bullshit considering trump is only 3 years younger...
Worthwhile read. "...The Harris pick is not only historic in nature but also has many elements that make it a powerful positive moment for the Biden campaign."
okay, i understand that. and i totally agree. the system needs to be made over, but do you really thing that the division in this country right now will allow something like a green party candidate to be elected? and what happens if we lose that fight? biden‚Äôs already a shitty.
JOE BIDEN MADE A REALLY BAD DECISION. SHE IS AN INDIAN JOE. MICHAEL OBAMA IS A BLACK MAN. W T F
No one DESERVES to be VP or POTUS. Everything should be earned. She didn‚Äôt earn this. Biden boxed himself in when he said he‚Äôd pick a woman of color to be VP. She was picked on a coin toss &amp; that‚Äôs all. Deserves?.You self entitled libs make me sick.#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
I was going with "Biden is one unit less evil than Trump."
Senator Harris is tough and can take of herself. She rocks! Biden is lucky to have her in the VP spot.
Amen to that! trump is so malignant people have to be in denial to "what about" Biden/Harris. I'll work for that ticket, but won't love them.
Yes, I‚Äôm sorry but Biden is a very sick man. Classic dementia. What the Democrats are doing to him is definitely a form of elder abuse. He needs to be put somewhere he can get the help he needs.
Voted for her, even after it was clear that Biden had won. Mostly in hope that it would prove she should be the VP ticket.
They support a Biden/Hitler ticket with more enthusiasm than they ever supported Bernie.
Biden Needs A Friend, A Real Friend, Or A Family Member To Put An End To These Shannigans! He Needs Medical Attention Not The Stress That The Comes With A Presidential Campaign! He‚Äôs Already Had 2 Brain Aneurysms! He Doen‚Äôt Need Another One!
Either trump wins and he makes things worse or Biden wins and he does nothing to help. Yaaaay
You think this is a great pick because you are a white Liberal with privilege. Biden and Kamala are horrible for minorities.
Let‚Äôs see Kamala called Biden a sexual predator and racist. Great pick.
Biden: "Hey Liz! Can we get your notes?"
So the #democrats now have - Biden, who sponsored racist criminal bills,  and Harris, who cared more about her record than true justice.  Congrats, Dems.. you basically have North Korean gulag runners for your Dem. Picks. Enjoy that forced slave labor while incarcerated.
As a math person, I really fucking hate how much the term "exponentially" gets abused these days. The only way Biden is "exponentially" better is if the exponent is zero, because technically speaking:  Biden = Trump - 1  Is the same as  Biden = (Trump - 1) * e^0
Everyone should be treated the same. Just cuz I'm not white shouldn't get me considered for a job over a white person who is more qualified. that's exactly what Biden just did yesterday. He admitted he was picking a woman of color,  it didn't matter if she's qualified or not
Thank you. I am sooooo happy todayüòä Biden/Harris2020. America‚Äôs hope for the future!üòä
Great that Biden is being responsible! And I'm pretty sure Jill lets him out of the basement on a regular basis. Did you see his bike ride?  I'm headed over to buy/donate, why don't y'all join me? She doesn't read the replies anyway.
"Better than Trump" is about the lowest bar you can possibly set, and the Democrats have once again chosen to measure themselves against this standard with a Biden/Harris ticket that barely clears it.   I'll vote by mail; no way I'm doing anything more for these two assholes.
Are you more excited to vote for Biden or Harris?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
lol did any one else get triggered with Joe Biden's "You ready to go to work!?"   I guess I do have traumas with white man telling me to work. üò¨
There isn't enough space to record all the laughter towards this statement. What you mean is she is the team as Biden slips into a permanent time in the past (not saying this with any pleasure, it is horribly sad). When you cast a vote for Biden you are voting for Harris as Prez
Kamala Harris is the safe, boring, obvious choice, for a candidate and campaign that are making a virtue of those traits. Biden's anti-attention strategy rolls on--or so I argue, in my new  joint:
You forgot your God. Biden stole that too right?
why can't we have you and  on the ballots instead of Biden and Harris?  That's a MUCH better ticket.
Saying #KamalaHarris  is ‚Äúnasty‚Äù is SO TYPICAL coming from someone #TrumpIsALaughingStock  who regularly attacks Biden and many other people he disagrees with first by calling them insulting nicknames. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Be wary of who is paying for four decades of Joe Biden's racist and pro-corporate policies.
Somebody I went to high school with called Biden a Marxist the other day.  We're so fucked. This Overton Window thing is a much more serious problem than I think most people realize.
I‚Äôm not being criticized, people are calling me racist and transphobic for saying I don‚Äôt want to vote for joe Biden. That‚Äôs just harassment. No one has presented a good, level headed argument that is going to change my mind, not like I was going to in the first place.
Not much funnier than  claiming  and  are far left socialists and then listening to the actual far left socialists saying that Biden and Harris are far too conservative.
Well get over it, a race is a race!  I am voting for Biden/Harris!  The alternative sucks!
So many vote on their feelings rather than on issues, wished more people wake up. It‚Äôs a total ‚Äúno on Biden‚Äù since Biden! Lol
- Fox News Radio  - CNN Suggests Joe Biden Could ‚ÄòStep Aside‚Äô for Kamala Harris -  - #abqfm #rockoftalk #ABQ #NM #tcot #nmpol #newsabq
Biden didn‚Äôt make the choice . The party did. Biden is the nominee but Harris will be President if he is elected.
You‚Äôre wrong about the suburban housewives, the one thing they are is very intelligent and educated .When you were getting in the election ,you said you wanted ignorant and non educated people.The Biden/Harris Team Wants ALL,they Don‚Äôt  Judge!Blue wave üí™
Hey I need another 50 orgs to email me to tell me who joe Biden picked for VP I‚Äôm still not clear
It what fantasy universe is Harris a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù pick? She‚Äôs both a bold choice, and a popular one.
Both parties have been blown up. Trump did that. He has been fighting the Cabal for four years with little help from the Republican side. Think Paul Ryan! Both sides are evil! If we don‚Äôt win, installed Biden will crush all our freedoms!!!
do better. #BidenHarris
Amy good morning ,you‚Äôll fit right in with that party ,Biden Harris, was watching GMA this morning ,you next to Kamala if your hair was longer it would be hard to tell you two apart ,maybe that‚Äôs why you best buddies ,have a great dayBluewave üí™
You are neither of these. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both.  You and your sycophants out putting down a man and woman more capable than the entire Rethuglican party
Dems line of thinking that I heard earlier. Biden, Kamala and pelosi. Biden gets removed or dies, kamala cant be a pres since she's an anchor baby so pelosi steps in, in her place.  Makes sense and why we have to vote our asses off. They will be cheating like dems do.
Back-to-back in my Trumpland message-setters feed this morning: Biden-Harris is the choice of Wall Street, and of radical socialists and anarchists.
Joe Biden is a practicing catholic.  You may want to stop moving known sexual abusers rather than putting them in jail.  And oh by the way that whole separation of church and state thing ....
I wonder if Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a racist?! The hypocrisy is unreal man... and Democrats are overjoyed at this news?? What a bunch of fucken idiots. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Tangentially related - how did conservatism become so demonized? I just can‚Äôt believe how quickly that happened. Biden will be such an extremely progressive puppet president for the new (D) party. I‚Äôm constantly vilified for preferring trump over the Uber progressives
Reaction pours in for Harris as Biden‚Äôs historic VP pick
She is not your opponent. She is Mike Pence's opponent. Your opponent is Joe Biden.  Try to keep things straight.
You are not only wrong, but insulting. The "suburban housewife" is a myth, a fable from the past.   Suburban women want a good and decent world to live in without all of the noxious racism and misogyny.  Suburban women, both married and unmarried, want Joe Biden for the POTUS.
I mean there is jo jorgensen, ill be voting for her. I can't vote trump just like in 2016 I couldn't bring myself to vote for him but he proved why I couldn't over 4 years. Biden/Harris is the Democrat knockoff version of Trump/Pence so why vote for DLC?
Biden is like Trump on steroids
Not full oppo. She was the safest pick for Biden. Just In an era of Black Lives Matters and Defund the Police, Joe Biden proposed increasing police budgets and now he has announced a cop, Kamala as VP  The Democratic Party doesn't care about minorities.
Not just rejoiced, at least in Biden's case he helped write the 94 Crime Bill, helping lead to more blacks being arrested and given longer jail time than whites
Kamala votes for Trump's military budgets twice. You know one of the leading causes to climate change is the military industrial complex? Biden is a warmonger and loves his fracking and fossil fuels.  Keep going though....
my mother went into deep depression in 2016. She died in 2018. I know damned well she's being a party animal on the other side today. She adored Joe Biden. And she really loved Kamala.
Well, I fully expect Biden to step down before even a year in Office.
You talking about Joe Biden as the racist incompetent bigot?  Cause if so you are correct. #TRUMP2020Landside
BLM,Black,Brown All Color Matter,Clayborne Matters,Klobuchar matters, Biden/Harris matter, and myself BO matters.History Made,A woman vice president, a woman of color, great woman. You able to tell grandchildren you helped first woman voted in ,blue wave üí™
People joke about Biden not making the choice. But I doubt Democrats would have advised Harris. Biden evoked his son in his tweet revealing his pick. Looks like a sentimental choice...an homage to his son...but one that will not likely help his chances to win.   Good for Trump!
Biden doesn't care old man.
Yeah I think Biden Harris is the dumbest ticket possible but since the USA is a 2 party ticket we don't have much of a choice at this point
Is this guy a former biden staffer who said this out frustration one day,  and then quit because the whole campaign turned into this?
Biden‚Äôs VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
It is considering biden is likely to die in office
Are libs attempting to reclaim  #ACAB and change it to ‚ÄúA COP AND BIDEN?‚Äù
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Also, just who is pretending Biden was going to give them a progressive ticket? Anyone who's been paying attention since before the primaries knew Biden's NOT a progressive, he's a rich old white man, kind of the very antithesis of progressive (stereotypi-/statisti-cally anyway).
What if Biden/Harris TRUMPED Trump's recent executive orders on unemployment, etc., with a $2k/m UBI #YangGang ü§ûüèΩüòÖ
Um wrong. Race is a social construct that is leveraged by trumps rabid supporters to justify kids in cages, secret police disappearing people etc. we are still going to have to organize against Biden/Harris but I believe more of us will be alive.
She was tough on crime. Maybe a little too much, but now that Trump is about law and order, she and Biden have to go to the extreme and be soft on crime. Whatever Trumps position, they go far left. It won‚Äôt work
Why is it the marxists groups want Biden to win? Oh yeah...they admitted it. He can be maipulated to do what they want.
Dr. Timothy Krebs, professor and Chair for the Department of Political Science at UNM, said the governor now may be on a short list for a cabinet pick under a Biden Administration. #KOBNightBeat
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
I'm so tired of ppl looking at the left as a joke, b/c so many of them support pedo Biden. Hopefully Kamala can change things.
I‚Äôve been on a friends FB looking at MAGA comment the last few days &amp; tonight after hearing about Biden‚Äôs choice for VP. Trump is such a moron, but his supporters, Gawd, they are truly STUPIDü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  YES WE CAN OUT VOTE THEM, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS VOTE! Show up, mail in, absentee.
what‚Äôs your call on the Biden choice?  Do I wait for Abes top hat?
I even have other reasons for not voting for Biden and I‚Äôm not voting for trump. Hoes just mad.
"he's spent his life fighting for us."   LOL, multiple citations needed.  I understand why some ppl want to put all their eggs in the "get rid of Trump" basket, but don't let the Democrats gaslight you about who Biden is. They picked the most Trumpian "non-Trump" they could find.
They‚Äôre acting like the country is going to nuke itself if me, a girl in NEW MEXICO, Doesn‚Äôt vote for Biden
I'm still hoping  will come through with the promise he made to spend money to help Joe Biden win. I would love it if he paid for the drop boxes for mail-in ballots. I like the idea of paper ballots this year.  I plan to mask and glove up and vote early too.
I never said I‚Äôd vote for Biden, it was bait lmfao
Mark, when do we get back to a national conversation on Biden &amp; Ukraine? We need to fight fire with FIRE!!!
This is bait. I never said I was voting for Biden in the first place and I‚Äôve said countless times I‚Äôm not voting for trump and they‚Äôre still here in my mentions saying I‚Äôm voting for Trump
Kamala the wrestler died a few days ago and that‚Äôs who Biden actually was going to pick, but everyone just assumed he meant Kamala Harris.
biden really saw the "vote blue no matter what" and said lol bet
Im not sure why #NeverTrumpers think this days is good.  It‚Äôs moderates that elect a president.  As a moderate Indpendent, that does not help me pull the Biden lever. It scares me.
Now just how the fuck do you know Biden's religious beliefs?
Trump and Biden are trying hard to lose this election.
Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate?
Biden spent years accomplishing nothing; otherwise BLM wouldn't be a movement today.
every time i hear any angle of support for biden
Say what you will, but no vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Perhaps we halt progress a bit for 4 years - is that worse than allowing GOP to elect more conservative judges who will effect us for the rest of our lifetime? Than further degrading of our nat security? #VoteBlue2020
Don't oversell yourself on Biden just because Trump is awful. On foreign policy and criminal justice issues, Biden's record and positions are as bad or worse than Trump. And on many of the issues where he's nominally better it's an open question whether he'll follow through.
This is Biden‚Äôs weakness. He must overcome this. Watch.
She believed Biden committed sexual misconducts and assault; now she is his running mate...
We have a Strong, competent, and honest leader already. And that's President Trump. Takes responsibility, that's one big joke, after all, Obama/Biden did nothing but blame Bush for all 8 miserable years they were in office.
I got the text from the Biden campaign, and it came across at 4:14pm EDT.
never forget kamala harris is better than mike pence. never forget I have to tweet this because with Biden the bar has been lowered to the basement
Thank you Mr Biden! I'm so excited about this, let's get Joe into the White House and  in as VP!
There's no way I would vote for anyone other than the President. And with Sleazy Biden's VP choice, the odds of me voting Biden/Harris got worse.
Veterans for Biden and Harris !!  Let ‚ÄúMake America Great ‚Äú Forever !
*Worse on Iran.  Trump's intentions on Iran suck, but he's too mercurial to follow through. Biden is more consistently belligerent in foreign policy and he's openly embracing all the Bush neocons who want to crush the Iranians under their boots.
Well electing Biden is a whole other conversation. There were better choices but we all know Biden was the safest choice. I‚Äôve just seen this shit pop up on FB already and I don‚Äôt wanna see it gain any momentum.
If Biden wins the election he will be removed from office within a year and a half due to medical reasons and/or a democratic (setup) assassination. Then our first female president will step in.
Anything other than a vote for Biden is an action that supports Trump.
Sorry, that falls flat.   Biden had squeaky clean 8 years. That‚Äôs why Dems put him to this task. üòª  Meantime, djt goes elementary school at every turn.  Including rapist, racist, Russian asset, shall we continue?
It's cute how you seem to think Biden/Harris actually want to pass a public option, free college, or a minimum wage increase.  If they were willing to tax the rich and discipline the MIC like Ike did, though, we could afford all that, M4A, and the GND easily. But they aren't.
Two people on my Facebook timeline posted the exact same article about Biden‚Äôs VP choice, both with two totally different opinions about the pick. It was interesting.
Wow! Congrats to Senator Kamala Harris. Biden-Harris will energize and inspire our communities.
Go back and read. I said Bernie calls those in the Senate his "friends", just as he called Biden his friend. If you really want to not vote, vote for the progressives that will fight for you, not for Republicans that want to bend you over like tRump. Just Vote.
FINALLY , some good, hopeful, inspiring much needed news!!! Let‚Äôs go Biden/Harris!!!!!!!!
Never forget. Who stands for working people and who made a career out of crushing regular people.  Biden chose poorly. #Vote3rdParty
Four out of five dentists endorse Biden/Harris ticket. I‚Äôm mean, look at those teeth! Congrats  and women everywhereüòÅ
No offense to Kamala, but this about guarantees that Trump will win. There are so many people against a woman in office it isn't even funny, and with Biden age, you know they are going to assume she will end up president and that is not acceptable to some people
Best Biden commercial to run in the south!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden! #BidenHarris2020
oi. I‚Äôm at such odds with the developments in this campaign. A part of me is happy that a Black woman will be VP, but I also feel like Biden did it ‚Äújust to do it‚Äù you know? And then her history...
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Remember when those Biden and Obama photos came out and everybody was so obsessed with them how embarrassing
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
BIden guaranteed a win in November with his vp pick
Also  do you still believe Biden's accusers?
We'll most likely get 4 more years of Trump. Dems hate Harris &amp; Reps hate her. He went for the identity politics pick and it's going to bite him in the ass. I was hesitant to vote for Biden cause he's a creeper w/ dementia but now I really don't want to vote for either side.
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
I hear this argument. But the DNC is not on our side. They are an obstacle to actual progress, and do not deserve to get to   take our votes for granted. Make 'em sweat. And if Biden is planning on putting Bloomberg in charge of the World Bank, where's the difference?
Yes! Let's do this. President Joe Biden!
Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
Yes!  President Joe Biden!
Biden-Harris is the dream ticket America needs! Get ready to loose
I don‚Äôt-just making a joke. My worth is in my contribution to society,community, family, friends.  I always vote, not just pres elections-I volunteer in my community. My family serves in armed forces. I advocate as a nurse and provider-what do you do?  Try to hurt others? #Biden
Watch "WATCH: Team Trump Online - Biden's VP Pick" on YouTube       THE CRIMINAL OF ALL TIME IS TALKING OUT OF HIS XSS YET AGAIN DUDE U DON'T GET IT MY GRANNY WOULD B BETTER THAN U UR OUT
I was really rooting for Susan Rice but I will fully support Biden-Harris.
Biden's VP pick was as entirely predictable as the rest of his campaign has been.

Wow. Already calling for Biden to step aside. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£  you are a clown show. That‚Äôs why your ratings are in the dump. Why would a guy run for president to just step aside and not fulfill his term?  #CnnIsAdumpsterfire

Hey Donnie! I heard you donated multiple times to the future VP Kamala Harris in 2014. I like her too! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
And I reserve the right to vote for whoever I want, Biden or not.
IF Biden steps aside?  That has always been the plan.  No one watching this saga unfold, ever believed he'd go the distance.  Every day it becomes clearer.
You think the problem with be resolved under Biden/Kamala...üôÑü§£üòÇü§£
She's better than Biden though. No creep allegations or sniffing ppl for her.
Joe Biden was humping through which rice paddy? Guess you didn‚Äôt know Joe, the famous high school football star, was deferred 5 times for asthma.
I need whoever is libertarian running for presidents views and policies. I will not vote for Biden bro
I was never going to vote for Biden, just also never going to vote for Trump. I'm an Independent, not beholden to either party. As a socialist, I can't reconcile even how the Dems do business, they're crooks too.
Biden =  Decency. Vote for Joe.
That‚Äôs not the only reason, you obviously haven‚Äôt paid attention to my other tweets. I‚Äôm not voting for either of them. It also doesn‚Äôt matter because my state is heavily blue so it‚Äôs not like my vote will change it going to Biden or not
I'm so excited that   has chosen  as his Vice President! She's an AMAZING trailblazer who will help bring the soul of America back to life. ü•∞ #Biden2020
Biden and Harris ticket - This is the ticket that will make America Great Again.
When did you become Pope and take away Biden‚Äôs beliefs?  You should be more concerned about all those Trumpers that don‚Äôt think Catholics are real Christians!
Kamala Harris is now the de-facto presidential nominee for the Democrat Party and the radical Biden-Harris agenda is way out of touch with the mainstream of America.  #VoteTrump2020
Picking Harris reassures Wall Street, Pharma, the health insurance industry, and the military-industrial complex that his administration will be reliably neoliberal even if/when Biden is too incapacitated to be their puppet himself.
Trump: 'Some people would say men are insulted' by Joe Biden choosing a woman as VP
G-d  you are entitled to your opinion and you are voting #Biden - sorry you were attacked.  We all have to unite!  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #TrumpFailsAmerica #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison
I am so excited to hear that  has been chosen to be Biden's #VPPick It is going to be so exciting to watch, especially the VP debate in October. #BidenHarris
You heard trump men will be insulted by Joe Biden‚Äôs pick. Women should only be seen in plastic surgery offices as centerfolds and as Pence‚Äôs mother in church next to their stick up the ass husband
And just to be clear, I‚Äôm a fan of the Harris pick. I think her and Biden make a strong ticket, and I think we need that more than ever.
They are three years apart lol. If you are taking that stance then Trump could die just as soon as Biden.
Yea, Obama/Biden caused this unrest in America with their forever divisive actions. When was there "peace" in the World, Never. And you actually believe a Slime Bag/Knee Pads ticket is going to bring peace to the WORLD? That's some strong D'Rat Kool-aid you're drinking, Cupcake
One good moment in the debates, when she skewered Biden with 'That little black girl was me' over busing.  Other than that, entirely forgettable. Far from being scared, Pence is relieved he doesn't face Warren.
Trump is literally ineffectual as POTUS. Biden will actually be able to continue the wealth-gap, money-grubbing, wealth-concentration, robber-baron, croney-capitalist agenda. Which is worse? They both suck pretty bad IMO. I'd prefer to vote for REAL CHANGE, not more of the same.
Harris ‚Äòhonored‚Äô to join Biden on Dem ticket
President Joe Biden!
Childish. I'm not happy with Harris, either. But I'd still vote for Biden over Trump if he'd chosen La Llorona.
Biden/Harris- out with the orange in with the blue!
Biden and Kamala just released their slogan!  Kneepads and Peepads 2020!
Biden-HairSnifff Loll!!!!!
The DOW was up over 350 points this morning.   Kamala Harris was chosen to be VP Biden‚Äôs running mate-then the DOW went DOWN 104 points. Retweet please...
And only reason I bring it up is because I‚Äôve got a feeling that even Trump wins again, he will probably get ride of Wray and if he doesn‚Äôt Biden will probably bring his own guy in.
Biden is getting more Twitter love that you
Thank you, Sen. Warren! Can‚Äôt wait to see you become part of the Biden/Harris cabinet.

It‚Äôs because Biden doesn‚Äôt take it personally. #BidenHarris2020 are in it for the American people. Not to cry like your guy üëéüèΩ about personal comments. Your guy is a whiner.
Interesting choice for VP for Biden. I suspect she will succeed him if he happens to get elected. She seems the type who would support a police state.
I don‚Äôt get the surprise, Biden isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt ever been listening to progressives. It seems like an attempt to please anyone on the ‚Äúleft‚Äù who want women of color in power while also trying to scoop up the centrist and cop voters who abandoned trump.
BIDEN VP üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The Harris pick notification sucked, but mostly because it just reminded me that Biden is the nominee
Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris, the prominent senator from California, as his running mate his campaign has announced. If elected, she would be the nation‚Äôs first female, first Black and first Asian American vice president.

If people didn't wake up with Biden's choice for VP, then idk what will. And I am not a Trump supporter lol
Seeing a lot of 'Mike Pence so scared,' but I believe he's probably relieved he won't have to face Warren.  I remember Harris in the debates; nothing special.  Yes, I'll vote for Biden/Harris, but my checkbook is likely sitting this one out.
I never said I was voting for Biden in the first place
Maybe Biden told him before he died. I am going to think that.
Correct. Biden/Harris makes a badass one-two ticket. Biden scores a lot of points with me for having the confidence to make this choice.
Hello Amy Klobuchar, We have been push Bluewave as hard as we can,we do not see any way that Trump can win unless he cheats ,it would be nice to have Biden,Kamala and yourself running our country. What part are you gonna play in the White House ? Bluewave üí™

I mean, yeah, at the beginning of the year I was upset that it was gonna be Biden vs Trump.  I even thought Trump would be re-elected.  But there‚Äôs no way in hell things could have possibly gotten this bad if we had literally any President from the past 50 years.
Biden and Harris all the way for me!
Biden/Harris 2020!  Out with the orange in with the blue!
When my preferred candidate suspended her campaign the only scenario that made sense to me was that she was going to be Biden‚Äôs running mate. I am awash in joy this afternoon. Biden/Harris ftw! This choice reveals a lot about Biden‚Äôs confidence and leadership.
Kamala Harris Is Biden's VP Pick -- I AM SOLD JUST BECAUSE "HER PARENTS MET AS GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY, IN THE 1960s."  -- Here's What It Means For The Election And Beyond
Biden/Harris 2020!! Out with the orange in with the blue!
Biden will simply mouth words to settle: the race riots, the trans community, the poor and destitute (or those who think they care about them), etc. while in the back-channel he secretly empowers the rich. All while nothing of relevance changes and the world burns.
Look up kamala Harris bussing Biden debate. Those should be all the keywords you need.
1) I oppose both parties.   2) Bid IS as bad as Trump, and I'll tell you why: Trump is so bad there's a strong counter-response to his presence. Biden will lead to more complacency as robber-barons continue to man the wealth-concentration machines with the DNC's support.
It's just plain common sense, right? That's the direction we, as a country, need to move in. Which is why I'm staging a protest vote to write-in Bernie Sanders. Trump or Biden doesn't matter, both will lead us down the same road of croney capitalism, wealth concentration machine.
you tryna get on your knees for Biden like kamala lol
Kamala Harris? Really?  Biden/Harris 2020? 2020 is a fever dream.

She'd be better than Biden to run the country. I don't agree with everything she wants, but it would be nice to have a president that doesn't have allegations.
Politics are so weird this woman really outed Biden‚Äôs racist past while they were competing against each other and now she‚Äôs happy to be his vp
Biden: I haven't picked a VP yet.  Boooo...  B: but it will be a woman!  Yea!!  B: The VP will be black!  Yea!!!  B: And also a cop.  BOOOOO!!!!
Don‚Äôt you just love it? Fuckface saying how horrible it was that Kamala was ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù to Biden during the primaries....! Hahahahaha haha
I grabbed a Biden/Harris yard sign!
Wow. Wow. I mean... [low whistle] that is some shot at Biden from the Providence bishop.
I think a protest vote in the national election is more meaningful, esp given my State never even had primaries due to Covid and that I absolutely do not no matter what support Joe Biden. Just as bad as Trump IMO and doesn't move the needle on... well ANYTHING.
Everyone will be watching Biden‚Äôs news conference instead   get used to being irrelevant

I predicted Biden, not Harris. It's time to start betting money on these things.
Katie good afternoon, I am so glad and thankful to be here in this time of need, history has just been made ,and I love the words President Biden and vice president Harris oh gosh I‚Äôm so excited have a good evening,Bluewave üí™
First we must get Biden elected. Then replace Bill Barr and hire an aggressive AG.

Name recognition, progressive female person of color. Basically the Democratic Party pandering to its progressive wing since Biden is an old white dude that‚Äôs RELATIVELY moderate in comparison.

and  That's a winning ticket!!!  Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate
NM governor responds to Biden's selection of Harris (Luj√°n Grisham was vetted, but had said that communication dropped off with the Biden campaign).
Joe Biden announces Harris as a running mate the same day I opt to move onto election work so I feel like this meme of ted Cruz
Biden could have picked a 2x4 with googly eyes taped to it for his VP and I‚Äôd still vote for him. We (America) cannot survive 4 more years of the orange one.
And before anyone accuses me of not voting for Harris because she's black or a woman - it's because she's shady as Hell, has had a dubious career as a prosecutor, doesn't make sound arguments, is a DNC shill, and yet another capitalist greedmonger. Same reasons against Biden.
Me too!  Biden-Harris 2020!
Hmmm, well, there goes any chance I'd even possibly vote for Biden in November. Guess I should practice my cursive to write-in Bernard Sanders. #nevertrumpneverbiden #NeverTrump #NeverBiden #NeverBidenNeverTrump
I am pushing hard, and especially now with VP Harris.  We will defeat Trump.  Biden-Harris 2020!
Priveleged?  What I'm saying is, they're is not a progressive running.  It's Biden or Trump.  If you don't vote for Biden, you are especially voting for Trump.  And, sorry my opinion doesn't matter to you, that is what is wrong with your millennial stance. All opinions matterüòÉ

News flash:  Biden picks human being for VP, with some actual flaws.  Would've been better if he had picked a robot, or perhaps some extraterrestrial being operating on a higher plane of existence.  Oh well, can't vote for him now.
Biden-Harris is not the "left" dude.
Kamala Harris is now the de-facto presidential nominee for the Democrat Party and the radical Biden-Harris agenda is way out of touch with the mainstream of America. #Truth
I am so happy and proud that in November I'll be casting my vote for the Biden/Harris ticket.  Great choice Joe!!!
Joe Biden ain't gonna be president if he wins its so blatantly obvious ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol
Yeah, I get it. Biden's tough one. 77 years old, career politician, and highly inarticulate. Surprised the Dems choose him. Bernie and Warren had fresh new ideas but were rejected. Must be a tough election for you.
I'm with you but it goes more like this: 1) Joe Biden and Kamala Harris destroy Trump in a landslide. 2) After 18 months Joe makes history and steps aside (reasons don't matter). 3) America has its female president.
#NewMexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham will not be Biden's VP.
OK ladies, now is your chance,now that Biden has picked a Women,Kamala ,to be his running mate ,All Women Will be part of History,Now you will be able to tell your grandchildren that you helped pick the  first woman and a woman of color,Bluewave üí™

"Nothing of real consequence"?   You may see it as inconsequential, but it's still more than ANY other President has EVER done for us.   Certainly more than Biden would do considering he said he'd never allow same-sex marriage.
He's convinced Gilead to provide over 200k people PrEP to help stop the spread of HIV...   He was openly for gay marriage back when people like Biden were defending DOMA.   He's been an absolute champion of our rights compared to other Presidents, including Obama.

The past 5 mo when I read a Biden Tweet saying "I won't abandon you", I teared up &amp; was blubbering. It was ok to admit my fear &amp; reassuring to realize a person of strength/compassion wants to do all in his power to lead us back to whatever normal is going to be. I have hope again
If you‚Äôre only going to go back to 1980 then yeah Republicans &amp; White Liberal Moderates like Biden along w/ complicit Black politicians that stood by &amp; defended them. Looking at you Rep. Clyburn.
If you're a BLM or immigrant supporter and you vote for Biden or Trump this election because waahhh Trump, then don't say anything about these topics for the next 4 years. See how far generalizing will get us? Nowhere lol
What does voting for Biden do? Other than marginal improvements. Look dude, I hate Trump too, but Biden is a Republican who says he's a progressive lol the point is, voting for another racist/rapist does not help change the system.
You would have called it real if it was Biden +6
I wish people realized that Harris is as much of a fraud as Warren or Biden. She's always claiming to be "African American" and saying she wants to represent "her people", yet her parents are South Asian and Jamaican. Everything she says is a fraud, just like when she was in law.
I personally think that Harris was their choice all along. Biden was used so they had a declared candidate on the ballot and could bring Harris in late in the cycle as VP. I suspect he'll step down within 6mo if elected.
LOL, no one is voting for these clowns. The public can clearly see that Biden is senile and just being used. Within six months he'd step down and we would end up with something like Harris/Pelosi in the white house. Not gonna happen.
I think you have it backwards. Kamala is the candidate. Biden is just the senile puppet being used to get her into the White House. If elected I almost guarantee he'd step down within six months and we'd up with something like Harris/Pelosi.
A libertarian vote, just like any other third party vote, is a vote thrown away that risks ending up with Biden unfortunately. That is especially true for the states who have now bound their electoral votes to the popular vote.
Joe Biden will win Kansas by 10
There wasn't. This is true about Bernie compared to Clinton, but Biden fared better vs. Trump than any other candidate, consistently, for months. To claim otherwise is to be as much a liar as a Republican.

This kind of herd mentality is why political parties will never improve, they know that no matter what they do or who they select that their members will support them no matter what, even if they had said they hated them before. Dems went from hating Harris &amp; Biden to loving them
Don't get me wrong, Biden and Harris aren't an ideal choice either.   But the presidency (in its current state) is nothing more than a symbol and I would much rather NOT have 4 more years of symbolic fascism.  Instead we can spend the next 4 years doing two things:
Lol someone said they would rather not vote at all...because voting for Biden means "8 years of non-progress" (this person obviously forgot a term is only 4 years) and that they'd rather see the Green Party thrive.  Isn't that how we got stuck with Trump to begin with...?
Who‚Äôs Joe Biden...and what‚Äôs a Kamala?
Today's Word of the Day is rodomontade.
President Joe Biden!
guess what?? No one is listening to you anymore. Not even Fox News....we just want to hear from Harris and Biden. üòä
Biden has to get enough votes to offset all the cheating and voter suppression.
"[Trump] inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground." - KH üî•üî•üî•
Just shows how much Biden has been in the basement. Talking about President Trump losing jobs and not helping states with Chinese virus. Dude thinks we‚Äôre idiots.
Congrats Senator Harris.  Together, Joe Biden and Kamala will bring our country back!   What a great team!
I knew Kamala  would be Biden's choice; I'm so happy!!!!!
No one DESERVES to be VP or POTUS. Everything should be earned. She didn‚Äôt earn this. Biden boxed himself in when he said he‚Äôd pick a woman of color to be VP. She was picked on a coin toss &amp; that‚Äôs all. Deserves?.You self entitled libs make me sick.#DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Biden: "Hey Liz! Can we get your notes?"
So the #democrats now have - Biden, who sponsored racist criminal bills,  and Harris, who cared more about her record than true justice.  Congrats, Dems.. you basically have North Korean gulag runners for your Dem. Picks. Enjoy that forced slave labor while incarcerated.
why can't we have you and  on the ballots instead of Biden and Harris?  That's a MUCH better ticket.
Biden didn‚Äôt make the choice . The party did. Biden is the nominee but Harris will be President if he is elected.
I wonder if Kamala Harris still thinks Joe Biden is a racist?! The hypocrisy is unreal man... and Democrats are overjoyed at this news?? What a bunch of fucken idiots. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mark, when do we get back to a national conversation on Biden &amp; Ukraine? We need to fight fire with FIRE!!!
She believed Biden committed sexual misconducts and assault; now she is his running mate...
No offense to Kamala, but this about guarantees that Trump will win. There are so many people against a woman in office it isn't even funny, and with Biden age, you know they are going to assume she will end up president and that is not acceptable to some people
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden! #BidenHarris2020
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
We'll most likely get 4 more years of Trump. Dems hate Harris &amp; Reps hate her. He went for the identity politics pick and it's going to bite him in the ass. I was hesitant to vote for Biden cause he's a creeper w/ dementia but now I really don't want to vote for either side.
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!
Yes! Let's do this... President Joe Biden!

President Joe Biden! Get used to it!
President Joe Biden!
President Joe Biden!
President Joe Biden!
Joe Biden was humping through which rice paddy? Guess you didn‚Äôt know Joe, the famous high school football star, was deferred 5 times for asthma.
When did you become Pope and take away Biden‚Äôs beliefs?  You should be more concerned about all those Trumpers that don‚Äôt think Catholics are real Christians!
I am so excited to hear that  has been chosen to be Biden's #VPPick It is going to be so exciting to watch, especially the VP debate in October. #BidenHarris
One good moment in the debates, when she skewered Biden with 'That little black girl was me' over busing.  Other than that, entirely forgettable. Far from being scared, Pence is relieved he doesn't face Warren.
Childish. I'm not happy with Harris, either. But I'd still vote for Biden over Trump if he'd chosen La Llorona.
Seeing a lot of 'Mike Pence so scared,' but I believe he's probably relieved he won't have to face Warren.  I remember Harris in the debates; nothing special.  Yes, I'll vote for Biden/Harris, but my checkbook is likely sitting this one out.
Biden and Harris all the way for me!
Yeah, I get it. Biden's tough one. 77 years old, career politician, and highly inarticulate. Surprised the Dems choose him. Bernie and Warren had fresh new ideas but were rejected. Must be a tough election for you.
Oh, you wanted a woman top of the ticket. Well, that didn't happen. And there were several qualified woman primary candidates. But the Dems choose Biden. How do you feel about that choice?

She‚Äôs talking about Biden right???  Lol
She sounds almost as bad as joe Biden
Bernie's Jewish, Biden's a Catholic and Trump thinks he's the second coming...so who hurting God?
Damn straight. I am a Republican and I will vote for Biden no matter who he selects to be his VP running mate.
Its 100% true. Why don't you watch it.  It wasn't the Mueller report, it was the Weismann report. Every one of the investigators was a Democrat, they were donors to clinton and Weisman is on the Biden campaign team. Youre a little out of touch on this apparently
WTF  TRUMPS have NO class  Robin Williams' daughter tears into Eric Trump for sharing video of her late father mocking Joe Biden
Dump the Trump  Vote Joe Biden for President Republican strategist can‚Äôt believe GOP Senate is going along with Trump unilaterally raising taxes: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre really going to do that?‚Äô
Lol but someone one time said Biden has dementia so this is all ok
Sorry but Trump signed an E.O that ended the Obama/Biden era policy. Research it
Biden is not leading dont believe the propaganda ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fox news is fake news  Watch: Joe Biden mocks Fox News reporter to his face during morning bike ride
We have given Biden plenty of ways out to earn our trust/vote but it falls on deaf ears. He can't even do a proper campaign from home. He admitted to possibly dieing in office. If he is elected and dies are his supporters murders. Why can't we challenge Biden
We need to get our America BACK, folks. Biden should be ‚Äúbiden‚Äù his time. He doesn‚Äôt have much more left.
How about Biden‚Äôs power hungry wife- letting him be made a laughing stock because she cares more for a Position and attention than helping a mentally handicapped human! Talk about zero care and unlikeable!
So fucking what   He's right as usual. Don't see you making as big a deal about Obama's hot mic with the Russians or Biden's blatant quid pro quo speech. Fuck all the way off you libtard mouthpiece.Yeah no time to waste! Tax...tax...tax...tax...and tax! The Biden plan!
Hogwash.....trump wasn‚Äôt the only casinos in Atlantic City to file bankruptcy. Biden‚Äôs been in DC for forty years and accomplished nothing. If there was systemic racism why didn‚Äôt he and Obama do something about it? Zero Joe......
Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt  done squat in 40 years except pass a law that locked up more blacks than any law in history! He‚Äôs not fit to be in charge of our country.
It is good to question.  It fosters debate.  What I consider good, you may not, and vice versa, and that's ok.  The progress with Israel is good, empowerment zones in inner cities, the first step act, to name a few.  The man is certainly not perfect but neither is Joe Biden.
I never defended his actions. I merely said God could use him just as He has used others in the past. Do you defend Biden and Harris's support for abortion? I pray for all three of them.
Oh, good one, did you get think of that yourself? Trump's not perfect. Neither am I. Neither are you. But I sure as heck won't be voting for a pro-abortion candidate like Biden.  needs prayer as does  and  And yes, I pray for all three.
Once again it's not about Trump. God uses broken, sinful people to bring about His will. With the examples you're using, the Biden/Kamala ticket can't be supported either. It is the most pro- abortion ticket ever. I'm pretty sure God is not pleased with abortion either.
3/You see you and they think we are ‚ÄúSmelly Walmart shoppers that cling to our guns bibles and religion‚Äù ‚ÄúA basket of deplorables‚Äù or my favorite from Biden ‚Äú 10% to 15% of Americans are just not very good people‚Äù. Really Joseph?..
If Biden loses, do not blame oppressed people for speaking out about how he has contributed to their oppression.   Blame Trump, blame Republican voters, blame the people who elected an extremely flawed candidate in the primary, blame voter suppression, blame the pandemic.
I have no patience for people trying to silence legitimate criticisms of Kamala and Biden.   Think about what you‚Äôre doing, especially if the people you‚Äôre trying to silence are members of the communities that were directly affected by their past wrongdoings, and you are not.
Never.....never.....never! If Biden is elected America is done as a free and prosperous country!

Pamela, where have you been the last 4 years, more then that where was Obama/Biden for 8 years did nothing to stockpile medical supplies like ventilators and respirators after H1N1? More importantly where were they when Russia was interfering in our elections?
All I get is Biden.....WTF??
Joe Biden is the Nazi
Automatically have a greater advantage, bc more people are collectively voting for one person. So hypothetically if 60% of the votes are democratic, if it's split 50/50 between Bernie and biden, the 40% republican vote for trump will win. At this point pick the lesser of 2 evils.
1. Implying Trump is unfit to be president because he‚Äôs disabled is ableist 2. He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwannabe fascist‚Äù, he is a facist 3. Holding Biden accountable *includes* criticizing his VP pick
I have concerns. I am very happy for her and VP Biden, but her being a law enforcement person, I don‚Äôt know. But I do know that given time, I will Be throwing my support behind Biden-Harris Ticket. Go Dems!!!!
I'm probably going to get my acct suspended...but damn it's hard not to call people out for the assine bull they are trying to smear Biden/Harris with. I can't handle the dumb, the stupid, the DELIBERATELY mentally unstable psychos who think they are helping "run" the USA. SMDH.
Kamala Harris, the descendant of a major slave-owner in the Caribbean, spent her career locking up people of color.  Democrats supporting #Blacklivesmatter rioting and then wanting Kamala Harris on the ticket with Biden would be hilarious if it wasn't so goddamn insane.
I‚Äôm supporting Joe Biden for president because he‚Äôll be a steadfast advocate for our nation‚Äôs public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
No you need to watch Biden, it‚Äôs obvious
If Biden is elected we will not get a president, we will get a chancellor that will unleash the left's morality police on us all. STAND THE FUCK UP!
Biden's only prerequisite.
President Trump will crush Biden anyway but Hydroxie is unpopular for 2 reasons it‚Äôs cheep and President Trump likes it!
Just because your a woman or black does not qualify you to be Vice President. Biden has no mind left and will be an empty vessel for ever radical liberal idea that comes along. Thank God the American people know this and will vote by the millions to re-elect President Trump!!
