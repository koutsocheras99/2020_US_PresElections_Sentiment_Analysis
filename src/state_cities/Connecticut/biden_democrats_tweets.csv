Biden's entire Senate career was defined by support for conservative causes like opposition to bussing, cutting social security, balanced budget, harsh penal system, Patriot Act.   FDR was nothing like that. He had what used to called a sense of noblesse oblige. FWIW.
At the end of the day it’s still trump or Biden....
I wish Michelle Obama would just surprisingly Pop on stage and say she was running with Biden
I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
Biden is creepy. But I'd vote for mickey mouse at this point. Anyone but trump.
You must be blind or something because clearly China sent the virus over and if Obama Biden has the stock pile full we wouldn’t have been in this mess also George Floyd has nothing to do with trump also blm is a horrible bunch of terroist

Joe Biden is gone in the head
Biden thinks we’re in 2024!

Trump did something for our country he created the most jobs of any other president he stood up to China when joes son hunter went missing because they stole money millions from other countries Biden had 1 million black kids killed when he was in office
Not me Biden killed millions of black kids in the inner city he locked them all up and took them away from there families all the wild he’s collecting 80 million for his son in other countries
Listen Biden already did 50 years and got nothing done he’s to old he will be controlled in the office also tell his voters that he had 1 million black kids locked up when he was in office tell his voters the truth we need the truth tell BIDENS voters that he blew billions
People better do there homework on Biden because he locked millions of black men up when he was in office

Yes, anybody who criticizes Biden MUST be a "secret Trumpster." That is literally how it works. Biden must never, ever.... EVER be criticized under any circumstances!!! Even if he was to walk down the street and murder 50 ppl, we must not criticize, or it means we are Trumpsters.
Exactly. Plus the worse biden has ever done in his life is probably no way even close to what trump does daily. And pulling the hunter biden thread isn't wise when trump has his 3 stooges +1. Dems may not want to throw feces but plenty of never trumpers would gladly step up.

Biden is a joke.... he barely gets out! When he does it’s quick and no questions!
Of course it is which is why dems need people to be victims. Victims are dependent. For 50 years dems have been disempowering black people why is Biden can say if you don’t vote for him you aint black. dems think black people need them...can you think of anything more racist.
Rigged only if you don’t win. You’re gonna lose!! Joe Biden will send in the troops to remove you. Start packing Traitor Trump!
It’s not normal. What will Biden do to solve the problems that led to the unrest in the streets?
I don’t support trump. Biden doesn’t care either, and Trump being evil doesn’t make Biden good
Biden isn’t running on a platform of major corrections. He’s running it on a “return to normalcy”. And why does his record not matter?  He’s a politician with a public record
What in Biden’s record makes you think he’ll fix any of this?
How can that be? I own Joe Biden.  Isn’t it obvious he does my bidding? Of course it is.
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president.  But is that because Trump used N-word routinely?   And does that make him  a) a racist?  b) an asshole? c) or all above?

When you’re VP wtf else are you supposed to do.  Biden died long ago , and he’s just coasting into the presidency Weekend at Burnie’s style .
I always say:  I’ll march straight through a klan rally to vote for Joe Biden in November.
Lincoln Project co-founder says if Trump loses he’ll ditch Biden’s inauguration and regard it as ‘illegitimate’
Was just saying this yesterday--though I *do* think the govt needs to take some enforcement steps, I'm not sure "Dems/Biden want to break up big tech" is a good message for marginal/moderate voters to hear with Nov approaching. (Just wait until after the election right?)
eulogy and talk that I have heard from you. We really need you on the campaign trail to be sure that Biden wins this presidency. I am so afraid that something is going to happen to prevent this election. I want to do everything humanly possible to win
Is it cynical to say a 1/3 of America wouldn't mind if Covid-19 wiped out the other 2/3? Perhaps. I think it's important, however, to recognize that Biden's election won't end the "long national nightmare," as George Will said. To do that, we must change the electorate. THREAD
1. The Post’s George Will gave voice to an opinion I’ve heard a lot lately—Joe Biden’s victory over the president would mark the end of our “long national nightmare.”
No, Biden’s election won't end the nightmare by
The Peter principle is real.
RUSH: Politico yesterday ran a story claiming that Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick. And then they scrubbed the piece. They scrubbed the story. Now, how does this happen?
And from a purely materialist point of view, I find it very hard to believe that capitalists are going to be willing to countenance a coup in the middle of a pandemic just to keep Joe Biden out of office.
a Biden moment?
“Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” Biden said, according to a pool report of an online campaign event. “That’s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.” — Seems vindicated, no?
Who will serve as a democratic check on Trump? i) Republicans who will vote for Biden instead of Trump (vote-switching); ii) Democrats who will turn out for Biden instead of abstaining (backlash); iii) Republicans who will abstain instead turning out for Trump (disenchantment).
This "opinion" by  does not age well🤪
Biden called it in April.
Meanwhile, your “instinct” is to tell voters that they can’t have the things that they want, and expect them to vote for you anyway. What’s to stop Trump from offering those same things in order to win the election? You’re not very good at this, are you? #Biden
2020 polls: Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden
We are about to experience a depression we haven’t seen in almost a century, millions have no jobs, millions lost their healthcare, mind you, during a fucking pandemic, and what does he do? Yells vote for biden over  and over again. There is no left in this country.
Yeah I supported him, but so what. Bernie Sanders is a freaking weak little ghost of the man he was or we thought he was. He should be calling out joe Biden daily, and calling out Pelosi and Schumer daily .... for giving us nothing we the people want and for failing during corona
Democratic leadership: *** votes down Medicare for all **                                          Bernie Sanders: hewoo pwease vote for biden he is da most pwogwessive puhson to wun In da histowee of amehwiccah ***bwink bwink***
What the actual f.
Like I get it, Biden is pretty bad and the lesser of two evils is not a moral argument, but this mo’fucka just has gotta go. The way he others whole communities is outrageous.
Hmm.  So a person with ambition shouldn't be VP?  It's hard for me to believe that anyone would say this about a man.  At all.  Did anyone say this about Biden? Who...ran for President in 1988 and 2008?
Again you can insult all you want or hurl names but you can’t even construct an argument. Democrats are not Marxist’s. They’re just not. Democrats are political correct and some are SJW but this is not the same at Marxist. Biden is the architect of mass incarceration lol
Imagine thinking biden is going to do left wing things when he doesn’t want to legalize marijuana or enact Medicare for all Two **checks notes** CENTRISTS things since the MAJORITY of the country wants them. But yeah here comes antifa joe LMAOO
To get the ‘thoughtcrime’ reading out of what Biden said, you gotta really *want* to get it. That’s kind of my point.
That Gorsuchian reading of the quotation aside, it’s just so clear in context that what Biden is actually saying is, “if you destroy stuff or light stuff on fire that isn’t yours, that’s bad”—not, “we should arrest people based on what books they own.”
more Biden- with a nurse?
No, it’s disheartening how many people are pretending to believe that Biden was truly saying “thinking about anarchist principles without any illegal actions is thoughtcrime,” when obviously he wasn’t.
I will vote Biden just because even if he not my best choice he is better then u u think cause u give a couple dollars to the people u are gonna when votes 🗳 wrong thank you but no thank you
You are the person in America you’re the most racist person you are not fit to be the leader of the people your trying to start a race war a vote for Biden is a vote for hope cause with you in power we are DONE. Out with Trump
Whilst Minnesota has seen a tad more polling, with three in the last month, the latest poll from  only has Biden up three points, down from seven points in the corresponding survey in May. 2/n
Both Nevada and Minnesota remain relatively under-polled,  with the former having seen only one poll in  database since Biden became the presumptive nominee, and could blindside Democrats come November. 1/n
What if we all just unfollowed joe biden on social media, refused to interact with anything he posted, promised not to vote for him until he had a Medicare for all plan as a part of his campaign?
‘This is health care moonshot time’: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left
NOPE...THAT IS BIDEN WITH THE COGNITIVE DECLINE! Hmmm where is Stormy Daniels &amp; her great attorney today? 🤔 Is Michael Avenatti still in prison? What a farce that was!! Biden Likes little kids rubbing the hair down on his legs and jumping on his lap...his words! 🤮
Wel right, but an ideologue doesn’t tend to invite people who disagree with him onto his councils and then move towards their positions.   Like I said, if Biden were motivated by “moderateness” above all, he’d have said “I won, you lost, go away.” But he didn’t.
I guess I’m just not following what we’re talking about anymore.   “Biden is acting like a party leader, not just an ideologue.” “Actually, the reason cops are disappearing people under Trump is because Biden said protest is good and arson is bad.”  Huh?
Biden says he'll name a running mate next week - Axios
This is the argument that Trump is making. “Trump’s America is horrible, and it’s Biden’s fault!” Super weird.
You’re having a different argument. You have reasons not to like Biden, which, like, fine—so do I. But they’re sort of not relevant to the point you’re responding to, which is just that Biden acts like a party leader.
Alright. This doesnt prove he has dementia because he hasn't come out with any cognitive results, but this video shows that he is exhibiting clear signs of dementia. Watch this:
In my original reply, I never said that Joe Biden 100% has dementia. I was making of fun of him because he has been showing signs of cognitive decline and dementia. There is no solid proof that he has dementia, but I believe that he does have it due to the symptoms that he has
There's clearly something wrong with him mentally though. Why do you keep denying it? Are you a Joe Biden supporter?
Let’s get Tlaib up outta there!  ⁦ !
This just seems like a bad-faith reading of Biden’s comment (that doesn’t actually intersect with my original tweet at all). Biden’s point, pretty clearly, is: “Peaceful protest is good, violence and arson are bad, and presidents shouldn’t have goon squads.” Uncontroversial.
Guess this means Biden will win ME-2
No, it’s a question. You mentioned anarchy not being a crime, so again the question: do you, with 100% sincerity, believe that Biden is saying anarchist principles are punishable thoughtcrime?
In all seriousness, just to know which conversation we’re having here, do you in 100% sincerity believe that Biden is saying “anarchist principles are thoughtcrime, regardless of actions”?
Joe Biden will announce who his VP will be next week.
How that headline should have read: EXCLUSIVE: Atlanta Biden voters Embedded Nails into Fireworks, Leaked FBI Document States
You just might be IF she is Biden‘s running mate! Whoever his VP is will be the new president if God forbid Biden is elected! Let’s face it he can’t put too letters together to form a word yet complete a freakin’ sentence! You know you know...that thing!!
Again, Biden acting not like a moderate ideologue but as a party leader.
Hillary is still relevant because she’s opening her big fat mouth &amp; throwing in her two cents with Biden...so yeah she is still relevant! 🤷🏻‍♀️
Joe Biden’s eyes look empty!!
RUSH: All of the news that Biden's got it in the bag, that Biden's up by 10, 12, 13, whatever it is, they aren't true, they never have been true.
This shuffling gait is a sign of dementia.  This gait is NOT normal and his behavior is also indicative of dementia, but he wants you to believe it's Joe Biden who is ill.  We know the truth #TrumpsHealthisFailing
Interesting research from one of my students on the expected impact of different Biden VP picks. Thread 👇
Important. Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy.
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
On Middle East Policy, on health care, on the military - the DNC under Biden looks to be shaping up as an epic neo-liberal war mongering disaster.
Also, I never resorted to chilidish insults. All I said was that you must live under a rock if you don't know that Joe Biden isn't all there in the head. It has trended a lot. It has been covered in the news. There are memes and jokes everywhere. Not my fault you weren't paying
It isn't my job to prove myself to you. You chose to reply to my tweet. I was going to ignore you, but I replied because you asked me to prove something that has already been proven. I thought it was hilarious. You are one of the very few that doesn't know that Biden is unfit
The "protesters" are "Joe Biden Voters" which he cannot deny....
Lets agree to call them who they are "JBVs" or Joe Biden Voters - lets put the hook in the DNC for all this.
Joe Biden Voters get violent? go on
Lets agree to call them 'Joe Biden Voters' (JBVs) instead of protesters, no sense missing an opportunity to piss off a democrat.
Conversely, Symone Sanders was probably the Biden campaign's single best hire.
This is so incredibly petty, childish, and crude.   Can you imagine any other chair of a losing Democratic campaign making condemning the Democratic nominee for President in such vulgar terms? 98 days before Election Day?
Lets all change the narrative- don't say "rioters" use "Joe Biden voters" let the DNC handle that.
Lets call them by their rightful name- JBvs - Joe Biden Voters.
Lets call her by the rightful name- JBv - Joe Biden Voter.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
It's not up to anybody else to educate you on something like this. It is up to you to look into these things yoursslf. It is common sense that Joe Biden is very forgetful. You must live under a rock. Try paying attention and keeping yourself updated.
Really? The women that came out against Biden of course were all liars...is that what you’re saying? Quite a few Women came out against him this past year &amp; they were brushed under the rug because Democrats don’t want to hear anything against another Democrat! That’s the Truth!🤷🏻‍♀️
Earnest Q: how possible is it that Biden is “moving left” w/ Task Forces primarily cuz he’s more afraid of Bernie voters not turning out, than he is of winning swing voters or suburban voters?   We should have more skepticism before assume this is his actual governing agenda.
Democrats that spend all their free time bashing Biden on twitter, we have no other option. It’s him or Trump. STFU.  Just go vote Biden.

My read as well: Dodd is Biden's Falstaff.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
I will say, I would appreciate Biden more if he picks Harris after Dodd came out against her -- Biden needs to repudiate Dodd's corruption and coziness with the banks -- and, frankly, this is a good way of doing it without going with Warren.   1/
I do not believe any polling. If you want to defeat Trump in Nov. — VOTE!   Doesn’t matter what state you’re in. Do not leave it to others. Biden needs to win electoral college decisively and crush him in the popular vote.
Biden would do well to take Dodd's recommendations and do the opposite: they guy is as bad for Biden as Rev. Wright  was for Obama.  2/
I have to say, Chris Dodd's reappearance has the uncomfortable impact of reminding me that  got his reputation as (D-MBNA), the senator for MBNA bank.    There are a lot of things I respect about Biden, but his cooperations with Dodd generally went the wrong way.  1/

A Public Option would be cheaper too.   But unlike Bernie's Medicare For All bill - which doesn't even include a funding mechanism - a Public Option can actually pass the Senate in 2021.   This is why Democratic voters voted for Biden, because we want real solutions, not slogans.
If Trump wins it won’t be because of Kanye taking votes from Biden. It’ll be because the left cancels everyone the moment they don’t fit their exact political views and conservatives stick with Trump even when they don’t completely agree with him
I’m voting for Biden in November too.  His VP pick determines whether my wallet is open or closed.
Will Biden - can Biden - get in the muck and mire when debating Trump? Will he "go there" if needed? Cause you know Trump will - we've seen it
And if Democrats take back the Senate, and pass ACA 2.0 with a Public Option, and President Biden signs it into law, one day in 2022 both me and Briahna Joy Gray will be able to buy into Medicare.   This is what Normie Democrats want, Medicare as Public Option.

Biden said he would announce his VP selection around 8/1.  So maybe another week or so?
Biden like so many others were misled by another POTUS about WMD in Iraq, but they believed back them, they has no reasons not to believe, we were attacked. Sadly afterwards the truth came out... but it was to late.
what do you think biden will be able to do about covid next year?

- Say No to Sleepy Joe.  Joe has got to go.  Dems desperate when they selected Sleepy Joe.  I voted for Obama/Biden 2x.. Trump enlightens USA.  I’ll NEVER vote Dem again...  Trump 2020!
Biden just lost a whole bunch of anarcho-liberal votes
The notes on Harris, who is a vice presidential contender, may be in response to a seminal moment in the first presidential primary debate last year.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. He might as well pick his nose. #Hannity
You have them confused with Nina Turner. With friends like her, Dems have it made. Remember it was the voters who chose Biden, not a deep state conspiracy.

Cancel culture is for people who only see things as 1s or 0s. I don't. Should I boycott Chik-Fil-A because they are anti LGBTQ rights? Sure, because I can always go somewhere else. Should I NOT vote for Biden &amp; give #IQ45 a chance to further sell out the US? NFW! #RidenWithBiden
Absolutely  I will remember on Nov 3rd pulling the lever for Joe Biden and screaming Fuck you Trump!!!!
Lol  Biden calls for violent protesters to be 'found, arrested and tried'
It's actually  Biden isn't the president yet
Fox is not admitting the collusion between the press &amp; .Biden. For Biden to win, he’ll need a Watergate!
doesn’t Fox realize Biden colluded with the press. He,pathetically, had a list of reporters 2 call
Even more pathetic than the AG hearing was Biden’s press conference. Press collusion with Biden.
THIS ANTI AMERICAN ATTACK ON OUR WHOLE SYSTEM MUST END.  BIDEN IS CRAAZY !! OOOPS HE JUST LOST HIS MIND. THIS IS PATHETTIC TV.
It is absolutely paramount that Biden's team keeps him in the basement as much as possible before November
I ❤️ Joe Biden
Ya no way Biden carries ME-2, or keeps it even, and she holds on.
Between she , Biden and the rest of the Dems . No brain is firing on all cylinders  !!!!!!
The House Dems are trying the Biden technique. They’re not letting Barr talk or he’ll make them look stupid. So glad I #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
We’ll get something similar in November unfortunately. Biden gets the popular, Trump the college.

Wow!!!! Jordan just unveiled the entire Trump Conspiracy. Rice,Obama,Biden,Comey, ALL BUMS!! DESTROY BIDEN!!
Next year? We need to defeat Biden and Trump *this* November!
I would think Chris Dodd wouldn't speak that openly about the VP vetting process without permission from the campaign. If that is not the case, that is a bad look for the Biden camp in another way.
Preach 🙌...when has a VP selection ever mattered? Can't wait for Biden to give the White House back to Wall Street like his former boss did!
These are some of the worst state polls Biden has gotten recently and represent an EC wipeout
I am not even a Kamala Stan but it read that way to me to. Biden should not have let that man go talk to Politico like that.  And CT politicians need to learn to STFU when they leave office. They are gone for a reason
Rapist Biden clearly has dementia and the middle road flip-flop dem was so easily hijacked by the Marxist/Socialists. Biden is even making HRC look good now. Trump is a big guy and has some belly fat as does most of the US even HRC
Both Mike Pence and Joe Biden are expected to visit the late congressman as he lies in state.  # via  Pres. Trump always declines to do things before its made public that he was never invited.
While I don’t believe this, there is no reference, nothing to tell us where we might confirm its existence, it is 43 years ago. I’ll give benefit of the doubt and say it’s legit. Biden has changed since then, acquiring wisdom with age. I dare you to tell me the same about Trump.
Brandon Judd: Joe Biden’s Support for the Defund Police Movement Will Hurt Arizonans
I like Harris - and I think Dodd made a fair statement. Harris went after Biden in the debate. Whether that's politics, is fine. The article wasn't about more than one Dodd reaction, before concentrating on the candidates. I didn't read it your way, at all. Pretty sensitive, no?
Mr. President, I know exactly what you’re saying! I defended you then I had to delete and block all these morons that were buying any fans! Joe Biden can’t put one sentence together! He’s not capable of being our president! You are The President.
That's also not really a strength of Kennedy's. Maintaining multiple homes is easy to do when you inherit several and have access to an unending stream of cash.   It's not the same as Biden taking the train home to Delaware every night even though he tried to play it that way
Omg 😳. But those bailouts tho??? I might have to delete my Twitter bc it really just makes me sad to know what is going on. And I don’t trust the corona numbers anymore, now that he won’t have them sent to the CDC. It’s a scary scary time, praying for Biden to win.
Yes, america is so racist that millions of POC flock here and find any way they can to get in...to live in a racist hell hole.  Sure, that sounds right.    and also, you think racist joe biden can fix it lol
All of the  gang members and cult followers are in full effect today...no policies or plans...hating Trump is not a strategy. Biden will just hand the White House back to his wall street buddies. Nothing will change but at least you liberals will feel good inside!
Is anyone surprised by Biden’s refusal to be interviewed by Wallace. Biden is weak physically &amp; mentally!
You can be a debbie downer or think positively and work to elect Biden. I choose the former
I am guessing this does not represent Biden’s thinking but rather someone advocating for another VP nominee.  I still go with Harris
I think an Electoral vote total for Biden of around 350 will work just fine
tho that story's probably the reason he's on Biden's VP committee

There is a direct line between the version of the suburbs Biden and others advocated for, one that's free from the troublemaking minorities in the city, and what Trump tried to invoke with tweets about (ironically Biden) "destroying" the suburbs by promoting integration.
This smells a little like Trump demanding Romney apologize to him during the Secretary of State vetting.  Not a great look for Biden or his team. Kamala was running against him, and everything she said was true, even if Biden thought it was unfair framing
No. He’s gonna pitch. Right after he shows his tax returns &amp; debates Biden.

Oh, right...that one tweet destroyed america,   bidens are very divisive too  It's funny how politicians who have been in office for 30 to 40 years, like biden and pelosi blame a guy who has been in for 3 years.  also, you didn't answer me as to which state rights he has violated

We need passion and compassion in the White House like never before. Policy matters, but sometimes implementation matters more. By electing Biden we will be bringing compassion back to politics.

According to the Tax Foundation...Model, Biden’s tax plan would reduce the economy’s size by 1.51 percent in the long run. The plan would shrink the capital stock by 3.23 percent and reduce the overall wage rate by 0.98 percent, leading to 585k fewer full-time equivalent jobs.
And the fact that the dems are beholden to china.  Trump at least puts their feet to the fire.  With biden, we are chinas country.
Biden's plans will be about $10 trillion btw
Biden’s tax increases would up taxes on middle-class families by over $2k/year, with a $1.3k annual tax increase on a median-income, single parent with one child. Repealing Trump’s tax reform will cut in 1/2 the child tax crdt and strd deduction, which help lower-income the most.
President Trump is man for job  I stand by me 100%. God-bless America and God-bless Donald Trump. And Mr. Biden should resign because of his problems the Democratic Party is using me. The clintons Obamma and other people in a Democratic Party and CNN is no good.
Honesty and decency.... let’s pump the breaks a little bit. Less rapey, sure. The only motivation I have to vote Biden is to get spray tanned raccoon eyes the fuck out of here.
&amp; we can only imagine what the establishment DC swamp/Soros/HRC/MSM honchos/Dems/Obama regime gov agency leftovers have in store this time. Perhaps a Biden bombshell is needed to sway independents/women/minorities/young. The swamp's traitorous acts are becoming worrisome. #Trump
Government Of The US’s Biggest Ally Is Reportedly "Desperate" For Trump To Lose The Election To Joe Biden  via    Trump losing support by a large margin across the World,this may be due to the continued Chaos in the U.S. and the Middle East.
Biden also mostly pulled from lower income households when he won.   Wealthy liberals mostly went for Warren, Pete, Amy.  As you can see, the split doesn't seem to be ideological so much as stylistic
Buried lede in here is Biden winning on the question "Who would keep Americans safe?" with women in all three states. Trump has made that the central pillar of his re-election message since the bottom fell out of the economic argument.
LOL #TRUMP2020 for re-election &amp; to keep draining the democratic DC swamp. The Marxist cancel mob hijacked rapist Biden who clearly has dementia. The majority of the US wants law and order not mobs of terrorists asserting mob justice. Many blacks voting #Trump.

Horrible of the leftist progressive agitators and resistance movement of Pelosi and Biden
And utter BS. Biden was saying “Absolutely” to something else. He’s on record as being against definding police. BTW, I am not a big Biden fan, he was fourth or fifth on my list of preferred candidates. Like my cat, though, he’s infinitely superior to 45.
All I know is I’m not voting for Biden nor Trump
This sums it up quite nicely.  Or as Biden says - We have a chance to transform America!

Naturally you don't understand the actual argument, but that's standard with you idiots.  Nobody excuses accusations against Biden.  We actually welcome investigations into them to the full extent.  We also recognize the hypocrisy of Trumpees pointing this out.

I get the extreme dislike of Pelosi.  Nevertheless it’s still not a good idea to put Biden in the White House.
Just because you disagree, it doesn’t make Biden corrupt.  Your twitter rants are sounding more and more like someone else that whines all the time on Twitter. AOC, Bernie and all your “idols” are voting Biden.
Come on, even if you hate President Trump, could you imagine Biden running the country?  It’s a scary thought!
And no small thing: Biden was on the 2012 ticket. So they were mainly voting for Barack, but they were also partly voting for Joe. And when they vote for him now, they’re also partly voting for Obama. Not just party line version, reverting to voting for the same ticket a bit.

We need to vote for #Biden.  Yang himself knows that to defeat #Trump we need to remove the republican party and get Biden supporters to see the brilliance of Yang's platform.  We can only then hope to start changing the status quo.  Yang is not going to be president in 2020.

The first half of this is good/damning, but the 'Biden Plan' is pretty thin; 'accelerate the development of vaccines' is maybe setting him up to claim credit for a subsequent vaccine but it's not something either of them would actually have that much to do with.

Donald - thats BS and you know it. Your father’s tax cut went 85% to the very rich. Joe Biden will NOT raise taxes on working class people like this video. In fact, he will give them at least as much tax cut as your dad. He will raise taxes on the super rich no doubt about that.

Even if off a few decimals either way, why do we have a President who is making decisions about the livelihood and well being of the People based on righting his own sinking financial ship?  Is Biden or has any other Prez/candidate ever looked at the Presidency quite this way?
But this is why Biden was the safe “progressive” choice. He doesn’t make anyone face any uncomfortable truths they aren’t willing to see... because he doesn’t see them either.
Do you share my fear that Trump will try to use DHS and rogue elements of our armed forces to seize control of the government when he loses the election to Biden?

Well, Nixon didn’t, though he should have. But Trump’s crimes are legion and far worse. At least Nixon never sold us out to Russia. Of course Nixon was pardoned by Ford, a Republican. I doubt Biden would be so generous. At least I hope not.
If Trump stops the Election, Pelosi should Step Down &amp; Nominate Biden to be The New Speaker of the House, then when Trumps Term Ends on 20 Jan 2021 Biden becomes the 46th President of the U.S.. The Constitution is really a Great Document! #TrumpThreatensAmerica

Was just saying this yesterday--though I *do* think the govt needs to take some enforcement steps, I'm not sure "Dems/Biden want to break up big tech" is a good message for marginal/moderate voters to hear with Nov approaching. (Just wait until after the election right?)
eulogy and talk that I have heard from you. We really need you on the campaign trail to be sure that Biden wins this presidency. I am so afraid that something is going to happen to prevent this election. I want to do everything humanly possible to win
Is it cynical to say a 1/3 of America wouldn't mind if Covid-19 wiped out the other 2/3? Perhaps. I think it's important, however, to recognize that Biden's election won't end the "long national nightmare," as George Will said. To do that, we must change the electorate. THREAD
1. The Post’s George Will gave voice to an opinion I’ve heard a lot lately—Joe Biden’s victory over the president would mark the end of our “long national nightmare.”
No, Biden’s election won't end the nightmare by
The Peter principle is real.
RUSH: Politico yesterday ran a story claiming that Kamala Harris is Biden's VP pick. And then they scrubbed the piece. They scrubbed the story. Now, how does this happen?
And from a purely materialist point of view, I find it very hard to believe that capitalists are going to be willing to countenance a coup in the middle of a pandemic just to keep Joe Biden out of office.
a Biden moment?
“Mark my words, I think he is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” Biden said, according to a pool report of an online campaign event. “That’s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.” — Seems vindicated, no?
its the ruling class vs the people .. same shit happend under Obama/Biden .. we live under an oligarchy not a democracy #UnitedCorporationsOfAmerica
Who will serve as a democratic check on Trump? i) Republicans who will vote for Biden instead of Trump (vote-switching); ii) Democrats who will turn out for Biden instead of abstaining (backlash); iii) Republicans who will abstain instead turning out for Trump (disenchantment).
This "opinion" by  does not age well🤪

Yeah I supported him, but so what. Bernie Sanders is a freaking weak little ghost of the man he was or we thought he was. He should be calling out joe Biden daily, and calling out Pelosi and Schumer daily .... for giving us nothing we the people want and for failing during corona

BIDEN 2020:  WAY MORE CHEMICAL THAN POLITICAL 😱
Like I get it, Biden is pretty bad and the lesser of two evils is not a moral argument, but this mo’fucka just has gotta go. The way he others whole communities is outrageous.
Hmm.  So a person with ambition shouldn't be VP?  It's hard for me to believe that anyone would say this about a man.  At all.  Did anyone say this about Biden? Who...ran for President in 1988 and 2008?
Again you can insult all you want or hurl names but you can’t even construct an argument. Democrats are not Marxist’s. They’re just not. Democrats are political correct and some are SJW but this is not the same at Marxist. Biden is the architect of mass incarceration lol
Imagine thinking biden is going to do left wing things when he doesn’t want to legalize marijuana or enact Medicare for all Two **checks notes** CENTRISTS things since the MAJORITY of the country wants them. But yeah here comes antifa joe LMAOO
To get the ‘thoughtcrime’ reading out of what Biden said, you gotta really *want* to get it. That’s kind of my point.
That Gorsuchian reading of the quotation aside, it’s just so clear in context that what Biden is actually saying is, “if you destroy stuff or light stuff on fire that isn’t yours, that’s bad”—not, “we should arrest people based on what books they own.”
Biden bringing nothing but fastballs
more Biden- with a nurse?
No, it’s disheartening how many people are pretending to believe that Biden was truly saying “thinking about anarchist principles without any illegal actions is thoughtcrime,” when obviously he wasn’t.
Democrats love it when Trump speaks. Another thousand votes for Biden every time.
I will vote Biden just because even if he not my best choice he is better then u u think cause u give a couple dollars to the people u are gonna when votes 🗳 wrong thank you but no thank you
You are the person in America you’re the most racist person you are not fit to be the leader of the people your trying to start a race war a vote for Biden is a vote for hope cause with you in power we are DONE. Out with Trump
Whilst Minnesota has seen a tad more polling, with three in the last month, the latest poll from  only has Biden up three points, down from seven points in the corresponding survey in May. 2/n
Both Nevada and Minnesota remain relatively under-polled,  with the former having seen only one poll in  database since Biden became the presumptive nominee, and could blindside Democrats come November. 1/n
What if we all just unfollowed joe biden on social media, refused to interact with anything he posted, promised not to vote for him until he had a Medicare for all plan as a part of his campaign?

‘This is health care moonshot time’: Pandemic pulls Biden, Dems further left

Wel right, but an ideologue doesn’t tend to invite people who disagree with him onto his councils and then move towards their positions.   Like I said, if Biden were motivated by “moderateness” above all, he’d have said “I won, you lost, go away.” But he didn’t.
I guess I’m just not following what we’re talking about anymore.   “Biden is acting like a party leader, not just an ideologue.” “Actually, the reason cops are disappearing people under Trump is because Biden said protest is good and arson is bad.”  Huh?
Biden says he'll name a running mate next week - Axios
This is the argument that Trump is making. “Trump’s America is horrible, and it’s Biden’s fault!” Super weird.
You’re having a different argument. You have reasons not to like Biden, which, like, fine—so do I. But they’re sort of not relevant to the point you’re responding to, which is just that Biden acts like a party leader.
Alright. This doesnt prove he has dementia because he hasn't come out with any cognitive results, but this video shows that he is exhibiting clear signs of dementia. Watch this:
In my original reply, I never said that Joe Biden 100% has dementia. I was making of fun of him because he has been showing signs of cognitive decline and dementia. There is no solid proof that he has dementia, but I believe that he does have it due to the symptoms that he has
There's clearly something wrong with him mentally though. Why do you keep denying it? Are you a Joe Biden supporter?
Let’s get Tlaib up outta there!  ⁦ !
This just seems like a bad-faith reading of Biden’s comment (that doesn’t actually intersect with my original tweet at all). Biden’s point, pretty clearly, is: “Peaceful protest is good, violence and arson are bad, and presidents shouldn’t have goon squads.” Uncontroversial.
Guess this means Biden will win ME-2
No, it’s a question. You mentioned anarchy not being a crime, so again the question: do you, with 100% sincerity, believe that Biden is saying anarchist principles are punishable thoughtcrime?
The majority chose Bernie Sanders. The DNC Party Insiders installed #StatusQuoJoe. "Nothing will fundamentally change."  ~ Joe Biden
In all seriousness, just to know which conversation we’re having here, do you in 100% sincerity believe that Biden is saying “anarchist principles are thoughtcrime, regardless of actions”?
Joe Biden will announce who his VP will be next week.

Again, Biden acting not like a moderate ideologue but as a party leader.
Hillary is still relevant because she’s opening her big fat mouth &amp; throwing in her two cents with Biden...so yeah she is still relevant! 🤷🏻‍♀️

Nobody cares or takes Biden seriously
Interesting research from one of my students on the expected impact of different Biden VP picks. Thread 👇
Important. Biden rolls out plan to combat racial inequity in economy.
Real T, y’all got mad at Biden for saying “you ain’t black” if you vote for Trump in 2020, when metaphorically, he’s not wrong. Y’all are just as blind as Clayton if y’all think voting for a white nationalist will help to improve your life.
Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances
On Middle East Policy, on health care, on the military - the DNC under Biden looks to be shaping up as an epic neo-liberal war mongering disaster.
Also, I never resorted to chilidish insults. All I said was that you must live under a rock if you don't know that Joe Biden isn't all there in the head. It has trended a lot. It has been covered in the news. There are memes and jokes everywhere. Not my fault you weren't paying
It isn't my job to prove myself to you. You chose to reply to my tweet. I was going to ignore you, but I replied because you asked me to prove something that has already been proven. I thought it was hilarious. You are one of the very few that doesn't know that Biden is unfit
The "protesters" are "Joe Biden Voters" which he cannot deny....
Lets agree to call them who they are "JBVs" or Joe Biden Voters - lets put the hook in the DNC for all this.
Joe Biden Voters get violent? go on
Lets agree to call them 'Joe Biden Voters' (JBVs) instead of protesters, no sense missing an opportunity to piss off a democrat.
Conversely, Symone Sanders was probably the Biden campaign's single best hire.
This is so incredibly petty, childish, and crude.   Can you imagine any other chair of a losing Democratic campaign making condemning the Democratic nominee for President in such vulgar terms? 98 days before Election Day?
Lets all change the narrative- don't say "rioters" use "Joe Biden voters" let the DNC handle that.
Lets call them by their rightful name- JBvs - Joe Biden Voters.
Lets call her by the rightful name- JBv - Joe Biden Voter.
Biden's VP shortlist comes up short
It's not up to anybody else to educate you on something like this. It is up to you to look into these things yoursslf. It is common sense that Joe Biden is very forgetful. You must live under a rock. Try paying attention and keeping yourself updated.
Really? The women that came out against Biden of course were all liars...is that what you’re saying? Quite a few Women came out against him this past year &amp; they were brushed under the rug because Democrats don’t want to hear anything against another Democrat! That’s the Truth!🤷🏻‍♀️
Earnest Q: how possible is it that Biden is “moving left” w/ Task Forces primarily cuz he’s more afraid of Bernie voters not turning out, than he is of winning swing voters or suburban voters?   We should have more skepticism before assume this is his actual governing agenda.
Democrats that spend all their free time bashing Biden on twitter, we have no other option. It’s him or Trump. STFU.  Just go vote Biden.

Biden should agree to debate only if Trump (1) releases his tax returns and (2) presence of fact check panel to provide periodic impartial verification of candidates assertions.  Tom Friedman's proposal.
My read as well: Dodd is Biden's Falstaff.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
I will say, I would appreciate Biden more if he picks Harris after Dodd came out against her -- Biden needs to repudiate Dodd's corruption and coziness with the banks -- and, frankly, this is a good way of doing it without going with Warren.   1/
I do not believe any polling. If you want to defeat Trump in Nov. — VOTE!   Doesn’t matter what state you’re in. Do not leave it to others. Biden needs to win electoral college decisively and crush him in the popular vote.
Biden would do well to take Dodd's recommendations and do the opposite: they guy is as bad for Biden as Rev. Wright  was for Obama.  2/
I have to say, Chris Dodd's reappearance has the uncomfortable impact of reminding me that  got his reputation as (D-MBNA), the senator for MBNA bank.    There are a lot of things I respect about Biden, but his cooperations with Dodd generally went the wrong way.  1/

A Public Option would be cheaper too.   But unlike Bernie's Medicare For All bill - which doesn't even include a funding mechanism - a Public Option can actually pass the Senate in 2021.   This is why Democratic voters voted for Biden, because we want real solutions, not slogans.
#Joe Biden will not allow School Choice for even the children in underperforming schools. Biden is bought &amp; paid for by these Corrupt Teacher Unions!

I’m voting for Biden in November too.  His VP pick determines whether my wallet is open or closed.
Will Biden - can Biden - get in the muck and mire when debating Trump? Will he "go there" if needed? Cause you know Trump will - we've seen it
And if Democrats take back the Senate, and pass ACA 2.0 with a Public Option, and President Biden signs it into law, one day in 2022 both me and Briahna Joy Gray will be able to buy into Medicare.   This is what Normie Democrats want, Medicare as Public Option.

Biden said he would announce his VP selection around 8/1.  So maybe another week or so?
Biden like so many others were misled by another POTUS about WMD in Iraq, but they believed back them, they has no reasons not to believe, we were attacked. Sadly afterwards the truth came out... but it was to late.

Stop spreading propaganda.  Biden does NOT want to defund the police.  Get ready to bend over buddy.  It's definitely coming your way 🤣
Ok guys time to sign up at  for your call shifts into battleground states, let’s get moving! I started calling PA today
Even if you don't want Trump in office its kind of sad people hardcore support Biden.
Is it me or has the country become extremely hypocritical?     COVID-19 applies to Trump rallies and conventions, but not to protestors and rioters  Me too movement applies to Brett Kavanaugh but not Joe Biden   My body my choice only applies to abortions but not wearing mask.
Senate Republicans can't decide whether to go all-in for Trump (stimulus $$$) or redig ideological trenches in anticipation of Biden, which means: those ideological trenches are and have always been in bad faith. Bad faith isn't just hypocrisy. It is the intent to harm. THREAD.
It doesn’t matter this year.  You’ll vote for Biden.  That’s why democrats love you.
I saw a comment by a man who stated he ALWAYS voted Republican but he’s voting for Biden but didn’t say why. I’m seriously afraid of a Democrat getting in as President they care more for foreigners and their rights( excuse me?) than they do for us
60.8 Millon infections in USA and and 12,500 deaths estimated under Biden from Swine Fluf Pandemic. And we never even heard about it... why?
My only political thought for the rest of the year - If Biden loses he should off himself because this is an EASY WIN.....and if Trump loses he should off himself because this is an EASY WIN... Hahah #ShitShow
The same arguments y’all use to support Biden over trump (harm reduction, both are bad but one is worse) now we CANT  use to vote for Buttar over Pelosi? Am I insane?
5. You’d think the goal is pretty simple, but that presumes the incumbent has a better than even chance of winning reelection in the next four months. Recent polling in critical states like Florida suggest he doesn’t. They show him trailing Joe Biden by double digits.
. and  Same as it ever was. I'm voting for  but no one needs a Clintonian revival. I still hope a progressive will get the VP nod.

Biden predicts that Trump will try to ‘indirectly steal’ the election - The Washington Post
Biden is knocking the hell out of trump and trump will suffer one of the biggest ass kickings in history come November
100% Agreed.However, I'm also feeling like Many Americans are waking up Big Time to the Left's Mob Media's Relentless Socialistic Assault on Peace Loving, Law abiding American citizens. The polls portraying Biden as winning. Is an insulting joke to any human with a working brain
Agree.  I've written a comedy book on the assumption that Biden wins.  If he doesn't, it will show people what might have been!  November 4th will be a scary Wednesday if Biden steals the election, which is likely.
Pick   Whether it’s the courtroom, the Senate hearing room, or the race for the White House, she’s in to win, and rarely if ever has winning been so important. My contribution to the who-to-pick roundup at

Opinion | Judy Shelton shows Trump knows he's losing and wants to salt the earth for Biden - The Washington Post
What do you folks think about  engaging in dueling press conferences with #TrumpPressConference ? I think Biden is doing pretty good with the press so I’m a little bit ambivalent. I thought today’s event with   was out of this world A real homerun.
As far as I can tell, Biden's platform really only touches on improving commuter rail to the Suburbs, building more apartment-style housing and affordable housing near train stations.   Biden is running on making the Suburbs more affordable, more sustainable, more livable.
There are in fact plenty of federal policies here, but I just have a very difficult time imagining that when voters go to the polls in 100 days, the big issues weighing on their minds are going to be Joe Biden's position on minimum lot sizes and the SALT deduction.
THANK YOU. How is it that Trump did horrible in a pandemic and the points are still too close. JB has 45% in Texas and DT has 44% Like what?? So people are coming for me when I’m asking legitimate questions. I don’t want Trump to win so we gotta push Biden to be better.
Exactly. I agree Biden is not the man he used to be. But we had 8 years of the VP and staff running things for George W. I think I'll trust Dem advisers to do better when they run things for Joe!
Obviously, I know about judges appointments which is the only reason I’m getting up to vote for Biden. But what about other people who aren’t us? I’m simply making the argument that Biden needs to provide more for people to get up and vote for him.
I am SO proud to root and vote for Joe Biden!
Do your fucking job- we have virus surge in the country and your buddy Putin have bounty’s on our soldiers in Afghanistan and here you’re talking about Obama and Biden. You have no shame.
Apparently nobody told him that VP Biden has had a lifelong problem with stuttering.
It’s gonna be so awesome when Stephanie kelton gets appointed to the fed in a couple years while president biden runs trillion dollar deficits
You have to be pretty bold to show film of the Portland chaos brought on by unnamed federal forces and claim.......this is Biden's America. That's some grade A propaganda right there.
Are we suppose to just let Biden come in office and it’ll be another four years of same ol establishment? If that’s what y’all want, fine. But people are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
For the people replying are missing the entire point. Another four years of Trump will be bad, we know. So are we not allow to make sure Biden is the best he can be? So indigent people can have fair wages, health care, talk about climate change and police brutality?
I get that, I had family members affected by the virus. But Biden does not have that much great of a record. Social security, Iraq War, money from corporations, not wanting to legalize marijuana. These are issues that are important and he refuses to acknowledge that.
I don’t remember anyone else apologizing for this shit either lol yet here’s Biden aplogizing for making ppl uncomfortable
By the way I will still be voting for Biden as I would like the next supreme court member to be democratic. I'm just not going to acknowledge him as some kinda of champion or direct counter part to trump. Or that these things are going to be handled SO much differently.
Nothing wrong here either lol Biden is just a creep
Also the war on drugs is a fucking sham that just puts minorities in prison at a higher rate then yt people for the same crimes, without lowering drug use or sale. Miss me with the Joe Biden wouldn't do this. He's not that much of a better option then trump.
Okay. But acting like Biden a firm supporter of the police who's literally said " I don't want my kids to grow up in a racial jungle " wouldn't react in a similar Manner just seems like a joke to me
Literally though trumps leadership has led us to this position😂 not that I like Biden but to act like trump getting re elected will make this better is a joke 😂 it will only get worse
You mean the same Biden the authored one of the main bills letting police act like this?
Can we stop saying we need to get Trump out of office using it as an excuse to not criticize Biden? If his policies are bad, we have to call him out so he can do better and people will vote for him. Otherwise, people will just stay home and Trump will get another 4 years
He’s touching multiple little girls chests....
Don’t cherry pick good years for Biden lol just take his whole body of work vs trumps. Biden looks like a racist who fooled everyone into thinking he’s changed.
You think this is possible.  Have you seen and listened to him?  How could this be better?   Someone else for Pes nominees and ditch the radical left - now this may work.   Till then the Biden formula is a disaster.
I already knew he did I was just saying it’s convienient the other poster left it out about both Trump and Biden
Biden is a segregationist....
So why are you voting for Biden? Lmao
He could’ve easily meant sexist and you’re saying all this without talking about Biden’s allegations. So we know you do t like racism and sexism but pedophilia allegations are okay?
Biden will probably does before he even takes office
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president
Trump claims violence in cities will get worse if Biden is election. I guess that's why his secret police had to gas Portland's mayor.
Dear Mr. President the black lives matter foundation...all proceeds are going to the democratic campaign...i bet that the covid is also! Biden Soros connected...God Bless wouldnt let me share the post
Biden didn't say anything he's flown home
Man, someone should tell Biden about all the other presidents.
Thanks everyone for commenting on Biden saying Trump is our first racist President.  The debate and media attention about how racist Trump is has been great!
A candidate that has no chance of winning. Why would they run Biden? #comptencytest
Outsourcing the happy talk to Obama! The contrast is so bad for Biden. Obama still looks so much presidential - and Biden looks sad in contrast
Biden has been pretty open about it
Your Right, bc after Biden wins it will be the MAGA idiots rioting bc they be sore losers! Then Biden can send in DHS/CIA Mercenaries to clean up the streets.
because the donors behind Biden want these protests taken care of by the time the election comes around so they can push the narrative that Biden is the reason the protesting stopped
Another reason to vote for Biden: TIME MACHINE!I forgot to add “Biden with Backstreet Boys” and of course: #KenteCringe
It’s unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn’t chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it’s one of the few things he’s said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can’t think of a time better suited for a delay. I don’t even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don’t even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden’s plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.
Not me. Biden was a terrible candidate in 1988 and 2008. He’s worse now. A puppet who was rescued from the scrap heap by Obama, he’s an absolute moron. If virtually anyone else was running for the DNC, no problem. But with Biden, I’ll take a hard pass.
Hey Bama. I keep missing you. Hope you’re well!
Yes they are because Trump will be voted out &amp; the native son of Pennsylvania, Joe Biden, will be our 46th President!!  #BidenLandslide2020 #BlueWave2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #RebuildWithBiden

Diggin the flow, mami!
Mr Biden let’s face it. If we don’t think for ourselves and mask up and “bite the bullet” here, were doomed. He’s never gong to do anything, he’s in a world of his own misery. We need you, we need you bad!
1. Only Congress can change Election Day for federal offices, not you  2. Even if elections are delayed, your term of office expires at noon on January 20th, 2021  3. Hell to the No  "Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow”   - Joe Biden
I don’t know if you saw Barbra Streisand’s stupid little sermon. She actually thinks people give a crap to what she thinks. Biden is honest. What a joke!!
If you believe China’s data, you probably think Biden is a smart man. Compare the EU to the US. It’s a better comparison. Let me know what you find.
If anything those who vote shame make me not want to vote or make me despise their candidate even more. My choices something like this: 1. Yang  2. Tulsi 3. Bernie 4. Warren  The rest were a no. I absolutely hated Biden, Buttigeig, Harris, and yes, especially Bloomberg.
I don’t agree with you but, I really appreciate you not vote shaming. I’ve encountered a handful of Biden supporters that do everything they can guilt me into saying yes. You don’t seem like that.
As to his running mate, Joe Biden could pick any stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.
A running mate? Joe Biden could pick any stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.
Dear Mr.President, please give Barr a chance to speak today, he was silenced, interrupted and disrespected yesterday.   Let him have the podium!  And, to Win  Let’s run all the old media footage of Biden when he was first called out for corruption early in his career, MUST DO!
Trump claims that Biden will ruin (his) America. When I read that I think to myself “and it will be glorious”. Trump’s values are spreading like an insidious disease and this is what it looks like. Stop the insanity. #bluenomatterwho
NOPE...THAT IS BIDEN WITH THE COGNITIVE DECLINE! Hmmm where is Stormy Daniels &amp; her great attorney today? 🤔 Is Michael Avenatti still in prison? What a farce that was!! Biden Likes little kids rubbing the hair down on his legs and jumping on his lap...his words! 🤮
Trump says the country will suffer if Biden is elected. Indeed Trump’s America WILL suffer, make no mistake. Trump brought us here, the darkest days I’ve seen in this country in my lifetime. Trump values the wrong things. #voteblue
You all know the 1st day after Biden is sworn in trump { he doesn't deserve the capital T} will say how much $ he lost while being pres then how big his companies grew cause he'd been   strongest &amp; most powerful pres ever &amp; his presidential library will be 2X larger than Obama's.
You just might be IF she is Biden‘s running mate! Whoever his VP is will be the new president if God forbid Biden is elected! Let’s face it he can’t put too letters together to form a word yet complete a freakin’ sentence! You know you know...that thing!!
Hillary is still relevant because she’s opening her big fat mouth &amp; throwing in her two cents with Biden...so yeah she is still relevant! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I can't imagine how ANYONE can still support Trump!! Thank you for always asking the tough questions every chance you get!! There is NOTHING, short of Biden shooting someone on 5th Ave, that could make me change my mind! #RebuildWithBiden #ToxicTrumpMustGo  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Thank you VP Biden!! Looking forward to dignity, empathy &amp; justice returning to the White House!! #RebuildWithBiden  #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
Really? The women that came out against Biden of course were all liars...is that what you’re saying? Quite a few Women came out against him this past year &amp; they were brushed under the rug because Democrats don’t want to hear anything against another Democrat! That’s the Truth!🤷🏻‍♀️
...BY VOTING FOR BIDEN
Fuck Kamala.  'Kamala the Kop' says she's cool with weed, but helped imprison more than 1,500 people on pot charges. I’ll still vote Biden but fuck Harris

I  forgot to add “not a warmonger”  Yeah. I’m still struggling, I don’t like or trust either. Trump did (according to a few source) attempt to get troops back home but, I don’t agree with many of his policies and his leadership is awful. Biden has no charisma and to me
Oh believe me Biden's supporters are VERY enthusiastic about removing Trump from office!  He is a serious danger to democracy here &amp; around the globe! He shows more support to Putin than a hero like John Lewis!! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #ToxicTrumpMustGo #PutinsPuppet
Yes. Those are all factors. And I admit there are people who wanna coast by with no hard work out in. I’m not saying Joe Biden can’t improve the situation for the working class. Though from what I’ve seen I’m not hopeful. Politicians don’t live in the same world we do anymore
Puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
Will Biden - can Biden - get in the muck and mire when debating Trump? Will he "go there" if needed? Cause you know Trump will - we've seen it
His handlers won’t let him debate, either. Americans deserve better. Every presidential campaign has had debates, they won’t let basement Biden debate. Shameful.
Thinking about making a BIDEN / TRUMP crossword along the lines of the famous CLINTON / BOB DOLE crossword, except only Biden's name will work in the grid.

It's easier to figure out who DOESN'T support Biden now! Trump allowed us to become the most infected country on the planet thanks to his total incompetence! Now he went golfing AGAIN &amp; the Senate took a long weekend rather than passing the Heroes Act for suffering Americans!!
What a shocker, well let’s move the golf game to my course, let’s have the g8 at my resort, and on and on like a James Taylor song! There is NOTHING he won’t do when money and/or re-election is on his wee little thing he calls a brain! Love ya Rachel! Biden 2020!
Perfectly put and sorry it affects you so strongly! I completely understand and agree! His fake narratives at the expense of Americans following orders are pathetic and illegal. Biden 2020!
Perfectly put! Donald J disinfectant is a commie lover and racist! He dreams that he can turn this country into the old USSR, and name himself “forever dictator “! Biden 2020!

Pretend u plan to give $ to BLM......follow the trail to where the donations actually go..... U will see 😳😱😱🥺 It is a front   The fact the Biden is a crook, just a side note here, and to the media ....not important  🙄🙄
If Biden was linked to Hillary she would be mentioned instead. Obama blew up his voter coalition and Clinton seemed to have no interest in putting it back together.
Lol....you're killing me Dinesh ! Dinesh: " It's hot outside"   Biden: "Make sure you wear a green shirt" ! 😄

That’s a joke right? The left sees Biden as a hammer and sickle? That couldn’t be further from the actual opinion of joe Biden.  Who’s trump lite
Who's behind Trump's big polling deficit? Two key groups defecting to Biden.  viaNo to Susan Rice. I'd prefer someone who'd managed to get elected to something on their own account being elevated to President if something happens to Biden. I don't want an appointed President.
Settle for Biden or as I like to say Settle ForBiden .... who are these people?
I will not surrender and I don’t understand people who will.   Settle for Biden people are an embarrassment to themselves.  Settle NEVER!
Numbers growing.... in a twitter poll not that I put much faith in them over 4000 people voted so I paid a little more attention Hawkins had 36% Biden 14%....something to ponder
Lol Hillary couldn’t win even when she won Biden is worse
Point is though you won't have to worry when Biden slaughters and dismembers Trump in November.
had 8 years to move even more forward with his VP Biden yet everything got worse long before  anounced his bid to run for office. Dont believe me than check the dates that Black Lives Matter and Antifa began. Check how Trump received an award for

Yeah, Moms for Biden don’t get 180 grand a year to sleep with the presidents son. 😊
I just wish the democrats wouldn't vote right along with republicans, with no compromises or arguments, when they do this.  Biden went on the floor for years advocating for cuts to SS and Medicare.
We need a revolt. Why is Biden even on the ballot. He isn’t well. We the people deserve way better. Vote trump at least he has some marbles.
That is true what u say about CT but we were talking about handling the coronavirus.  If u want 2 talk prosperity under Democratic &amp; Republican leadership, I give u this graph.  Don't worry about Biden. Look at the country now. Can u honestly tell me it's better than 4 yrs ago?
Hard to believe Bernie picked Biden over us
Most leftest and progressives I know openly despise Biden and the Democratic party. I think they are in for a very harsh awakening come January.
The only people who are delusional are the ones who think Trump is good for this country and Biden is bad. Read more my friend. Turn off Fox News.
It’s delusional to think Biden or trump cares about you.
Agreed. Along with Biden, Cheney, and most of both administrations
Not voting in the November election this year is one more vote for Trump. Idgaf what you think about Biden, I don’t like him. He isn’t Batman or Superman, he’s not the hero of the long run. He’s the step in the right direction towards a better future

That’s all the choice you got. Go with Biden!!
Has anyone seen a Biden bumper sticker or yard sign?   Seen plenty of #trump2020 flags waving proudly. Heck, I haven’t seen a campaign TV spot from Biden either. What’s the DNC doing with all that campaign $$?  Bail $$ maybe?

She does have bigger balls than biden
What was ridiculous about my comment? You said only republicans have to use state media. Do you think the media is not nosed towards Dems? Your the one in denial my friend. I honestly wasted too much time with you so have a great day. Good luck with Jo Biden as your nominee!!
And again we may disagree on politics but hopefully all of us agree this country needs to come together.. I'm not a big trump fan but I'm not of biden either... Both parties are at this point, incompetent
You may wanna start looking at people who got rich while in office and not before. Pelosi, Biden, Obama. All millionaires after being in office.
I think the only thing that prevents Biden from doing 8 years is his health. He would be 85 or 86 at the end of a second term. A healthy 77-year old has a remaining actuarial life expectancy of 10 years so you can’t rule out two terms.

I’ve around a long time and I’m trying to remember that support for white supremacists in the last sixty years? You want to refresh my memory? I do remember lots of Democratic politicians in the 60’s and 70’s that were very racist. All friends of Joe Biden’s.
Take a pic next time you see a Biden yard sign.... you won’t see any.....this is manufactured enthusiasm
That was actually far more coherent than any Biden speech I've ever heard
Most people just want Trump outta the White House so they're going to vote for Biden just because. Both Biden and Trump are creepy and sexist in my opinion both have no interest in helping black people but Biden is the lesser of two evils kinda🤔!!!
Can't declare bankruptcy on student loans no matter what.  WTF are you talking about.  It's not Biden's fault.

With you all the way,  If Biden wins by an electoral college landslide, trump will have nothing to contest. We must ignore the polls and vote like our lives depended on it.
This is Joe Biden.....prostitute
It was funny and showed trumps humor and cognitive skills that people should compare biden to..
Yes, we should all be concerned  But we need to channel the worry,  frustration and fear into action now There is something that each of us can identify to contribute to a Biden landslide  And now is the time to figure out what our personal roles are and do it!
Maybe he will take into his thought process the suffering of the people in this country and help them out.  What if he gave us everything Biden said no to or would veto....
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I feel at least there’s a conscience there... unlike Biden or Trump
The pic you labeled “Biden” is Trump’s America. Trump supporters are already blaming the next administration for Trump’s fuck-ups.
We all know Biden is a sniveling creep living in his basement like a rat.
And BIden has the nerve to say that Trump only cares sbout himself! This is a perfect example of the left NOT CARING ABOUT THE SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS. TRUMP DOES CARE AND WANTS TO HELP!!
I’d say good predicting especially since Biden yard signs are as rare as the horned hooter owl
It would be reason #157 not to vote for Biden

Biden- makes deals with corporate America for political funding, lined the pockets of Democrats for decades, thinks “you ain’t black” if you don’t vote for him. Trump- gave up a “dream life” to help people, doesnt take pay, brought the economy to the best it has been in years
I have been saying the same thing since Joe Biden was nominated! Another woman with the ideal credentials to assume the Presidency!
THOUGHTS?? We all know that China would love to have a Biden Presidency! It seems very suspicious to me that they could have stopped the virus but chose not to! WHY do the Dems defend China! Think about it. If the country shuts down it shuts down our economy ! Works for the left!
Biden says he wants to redirect funds from the police, well in my book thats just another way of saying DEFUND!! YOU MUST DEFUND TO REDIRECT!!! Don't play word games!!
Biden gets more cash, Trump has as many donors in the state
So you are admitting it was completely wrong of Trump to mock Joe Biden and the Democrats for canceling their convention because it was obvious it could not be done safely. Trump canceled because nobody was going to go anyway.
How can investors hedge funds against potential Biden Presidency? If Biden wins, we can expect 2 trends in long-term: the price of oil and gas will definitely rise first of all, because he wants to limit drilling; 2nd, only oil companies on state territory will be exempt...
Crazy that this is happening with a Republican President in office. And they worry about Biden.
“Hey  I hope you score a lot of touchdowns and win the Stanley cup this year!”  - Joe Biden
Isn’t creepy a matter of opinion.  I’d like to know more about the creepiness....is it Joe Biden creepiness?
This election isn't about Biden, it's a referendum on Trump. You saw that in Obama's reelection in 2012, W's reelection v Kerry in 2004 Clinton in 96 and HWs loss in 92. These elections are always about the incumbent
Biden campaign goes on offensive against Republican Senator Ron Johnson’s Burisma probe  via   Go Joe! #ONEV1
This but unironically  But I’m not voting for Biden
Biden and Obama say TRUMP refuses to take responsibility for the CHINA virus! Well guess what, He's not responsible! He is however responsible for fighting it even though he was left with a depleted medical PPE by your administration! DO YOU TAKE RESPONISBILITY FOR THAT!!??
Biden will be our FIRST president entering the White House with dementia  but he won’t be the first leaving with it
That there is nothing to find is just incentive to make shit up. Dirt on Biden doesn’t need to be true to be an effective smear; it just needs to be believable by a few swing voters who are inexplicably still on the fence.
Democrats love to tax corporations and force them out. Trump lowered the corporate taxes to bring companies back. Biden will raise them right back up and encourage the corporations to do business in China
I am gonna retire with a big fat pension and 401k. Good luck accomplishing that in Biden’s America. You know what a pension is right. Something your generation will never have
the Democratic Party has lost every attempt to overthrow this presidency Legally or otherwise. They’ve come up with Joe Biden who hardly has a grasp on what day it is. They know they’re gonna lose the election so they have resorted to violence through the Antifa group.
I have listened to the first Biden podcast three times and I’ve never done that for a podcast before
That's it, the election is over. With the Iranian endorsement, there's nothing to stop Biden. 😂
Like, hypothetically, sure. Biden has been consistently pro police violence over the last several decades and would likely continue Trump's policies on how to deal with the protests.  But, at the moment it is Trump's, not Biden's, policies being enforced.
Should apply to Biden
Its simple, liberals aren't voting FOR BIden , they're voting against Trump!
Also Biden competing in Texas and Georgia gives the Democrats more avenues to retaking the Senate these all matter
I think 4 parties is the right number... being as honesty Biden running would be in my opinion a moderate vote Bernie being the progressive... Trump being trump... and then a guy like Rand Paul/Mike Lee/ Ted Cruz being a hardline Conservative or NeoConBiden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week

Which conjures a great image of an irate Biden wrestling a gun away from an apologetic would-be assassin in order to kill himself.  "Fuck you, I would make a great assassination victim. You put me on that list. YOU PUT ME ON THAT LIST!"
Remembering back to that time when Osama bin Laden told every global jihadist to try to kill Obama or Patraeus but not Biden because 'Biden is so unprepared for the Presidency' that he would cause more harm alive than  dead.

Today is a dark day in the US Government. Democrats reemphasized that they are a bunch of #Bullies, and also am wondering if #ValDemmings gave up her chance to be VP for Biden.
You'd figure after month and months of not answering questions, after his speech. He would have been good at it. NOPE, My we present Joe #MajorGaffe Biden at your service. I am waiting for his coined phrase "You know the Thing"
I think the only thing that prevents Biden from doing 8 years is his health. He would be 85 or 86 at the end of a second term. A healthy 77-year old has a remaining actuarial life expectancy of 10 years so you can’t rule out two terms.
Good morning! Start your day with this salty read. Your welcome! #Trump2020LandslideVictory

I hear you, I just see a lot of people praising Obama when they shouldn't and I fear that it could lead to people not holding anyone who isn't Trump accountable in the future. Mad I have to vote Biden, but I will vote for him nevertheless
.      Should start preparing for the conversation that dems will force trump to either debate kamala harris or no one at all. Joe Biden will never get on a debate stage with donald trump
I hope with all my heart that this is a harbinger of Michigan voting for Biden and not Trump this November.
Kamala Harris' selection proves Dems know they have ZERO chance of beating Trump in 2020.  No moderate will ever vote for a CA rep with Biden's dementia.
When Biden announces Kamala Harris as his VP next week, it will be the greatest gift for Donald Trump that you can imagine.  No moderate voter will vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.   CA is not the way to run this country - and Harris will wear that moniker the entire campaign
I also heard you can watch the submarine races from BIDEN ISLAND to EPSTEIN ISLAND.
It is the greatest gift to Trump and the GOP if Biden picks that lunatic from CA
She does have bigger balls than biden
And again we may disagree on politics but hopefully all of us agree this country needs to come together.. I'm not a big trump fan but I'm not of biden either... Both parties are at this point, incompetent
I'll retweet this after Biden's loss. It will be awesome.

We being Democrats.  Sorry Alec - 1/3 of ALL voters don't believe the coronavirus numbers.  1/2 of voters believe Biden has Dementia
It sure did become available. Doesn't change the fact that obama/biden totally fucked up the response. Bidens own chief of staff said at the time "we did everything wrong." But hey, no matter, no need to destroy the economy
I'm agreeing with you Ulysses. My comment was made in jest - Obama/Biden were a disaster on H1N1
President Joe Biden - that's a good one

Look up bigot in a dictionary Biden’s picture will be there What are blacks thinking ?
Harris is not my fave. I actually am not a fan. But, in terms of enthusiasm, she’ll bring it. I love Bottoms, to me she has it all! Also, those talking about Rice? Seems no one remembers The Benghazi hearings. Biden has tons of foreign policy cred, he doesn’t need her.
I don't follow the NHL so I can't speak to that. As for Biden, I can tell from your tweet history that you are a big Trump guy but many smart rational people think Biden is the best guy for our country. It's ok that you have a different opinion but don't be obtuse about it.
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said

You cannot say that voting for Biden is "voting for the lesser of two evils" and then turn around and insist that Biden will make things better.   That's not what evil people do. So either you say he's not evil, or that we're actively making things worse.
What alternative does Biden offer? He proposes more lockdowns and viewing America through racial lens.   Implication this case Trump leaving office would make racism and covid no longer apocalyptic crises.

Under no circumstances can the left allow Biden to to interviews that are not pre scripted for him. The truth about Bidens diminished mental health must be kept hidden at all costs!
Joe Biden has dementia and people like you love that so you can manipulate him. Chris Wallace who did a fantastic interview with Trump has repeated ask Biden to do an interview with him - repeatedly gets a NO! And the rumor is that Biden will not do any debates - why is that ??
We need passion and compassion in the White House like never before. Policy matters, but sometimes implementation matters more. By electing Biden we will be bringing compassion back to politics.
President Trump is man for job  I stand by me 100%. God-bless America and God-bless Donald Trump. And Mr. Biden should resign because of his problems the Democratic Party is using me. The clintons Obamma and other people in a Democratic Party and CNN is no good.

I forgot to add “Biden with Backstreet Boys” and of course: #KenteCringe
Even Rice who has notable baggage wouldn’t blow it for Biden. Every choice comes with some risk. However, not enough to swing an election like this.
The incumbent president is on pace to lose in a landslide, and people think a pretty anonymous congresswoman who went on a trip 50 years ago to Cuba and had one ill worded quote is going to blow it all for Biden.
Isn't that what you are complaining about? That capital gains taxes will match the earned income tax rate?
I’m betting Obama, Radical Do-Nothing Democrats, Biden, ANTIFA, and the Lamestream Media will also be on the list.
I really think it will easily come off as a fishing expedition considering this was nearly half a century ago. She’s admitted to the Biden campaign that it would come up and even Annette Taddeo said it might cause some problems, but that it certainly wasn’t cataclysmic.
Is #Nunes #conspiring with #Russians to #subvert #presidential #election, #politics
Never said that.  I'm clearly stating what many people are feeling. Fyi 77% of Democrats are voting against trump, not for Biden.
It’s unfortunate that the left has to fight the Democratic Party during a time where we all see the danger of another term. The danger doesn’t chance the fact that progressives are not represented by Biden. We have integrity. We believe our country is better that the status quo.
Honestly, it’s one of the few things he’s said lately that I agree with. In a pandemic with no campaigning or debates, and people worried to vote in person, I can’t think of a time better suited for a delay. I don’t even know what Biden stands for.
I get that some people want Trump out, but if there was ever a time to postpone an election to a time when you could campaign, debate, and vote safely, this would be the one. I don’t even know what Biden stands for at this point.
It would have fallen 95% if Biden had been in charge.
Biden’s plan is to hopefully still be able to dress himself in the morning.
I agree, Donald Trump is not a great guy, but look at our current options. Joe Biden? Dont use the word decent. We had an opportunity to get creative bu the party is being run by the crazy far left. They have zero perspective on what it takes to run an economy.

According to this ridiculous line of argument Reagan should not pick HW Bush for VP because he attacked him in the primary?  And Biden should pick an unqualified black woman for VP because Kamala is too ambitious and would run for President.... LIKE EVERY OTHER VP IN HISTORY

If you believe China’s data, you probably think Biden is a smart man. Compare the EU to the US. It’s a better comparison. Let me know what you find.
And here comes #SleepyJoe Biden on his way to the DNC convention in Milwaukee to thank “the Windy City” for it’s hospitality and looking forward to finding out who’s running for President. #votemrmagoonomatterwho
If anything those who vote shame make me not want to vote or make me despise their candidate even more. My choices something like this: 1. Yang  2. Tulsi 3. Bernie 4. Warren  The rest were a no. I absolutely hated Biden, Buttigeig, Harris, and yes, especially Bloomberg.
I don’t agree with you but, I really appreciate you not vote shaming. I’ve encountered a handful of Biden supporters that do everything they can guilt me into saying yes. You don’t seem like that.
Maybe you should put your energy into convincing the party to drop Biden, who is functionally one of the most significant structural racists IN AMERICAN HISTORY,  before  nomination is officially set, instead of this sad passive struggle for a symbolic appointment.
If Biden wins, his VP is going to be the presumptive nominee after his term, whoever it is. Taking office with a VP ready to serve is always important, but would be an essential selling point now.  Getting them ready for the Presidency should be a high priority.
How does any sane person think Biden is fit to be POTUS. I get that they hate Trump but everything they've tried has been fake and now this Biden support show what that what they said about T45 was all bogus. Can't eat your cake and have it too.
Since the rangers are back and sports are starting to come back I will no longer be tweeting or liking any more politics (except to make fun of Biden cuz it’s just hilarious). It has been a lot of fun pissing everyone off. Open your eyes. Go Vote. ⚡️⚡️
As to his running mate, Joe Biden could pick any stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.
A running mate? Joe Biden could pick any stranger in the middle of Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.
Dear Mr.President, please give Barr a chance to speak today, he was silenced, interrupted and disrespected yesterday.   Let him have the podium!  And, to Win  Let’s run all the old media footage of Biden when he was first called out for corruption early in his career, MUST DO!
Trump claims that Biden will ruin (his) America. When I read that I think to myself “and it will be glorious”. Trump’s values are spreading like an insidious disease and this is what it looks like. Stop the insanity. #bluenomatterwho
Trump says the country will suffer if Biden is elected. Indeed Trump’s America WILL suffer, make no mistake. Trump brought us here, the darkest days I’ve seen in this country in my lifetime. Trump values the wrong things. #voteblue
Biden needs to be thrown off the ticket. There is going to be a mutiny against the vampires that own the party. This man is a racist and a fascist to his core, he is not meaningfully different than Trump.
You all know the 1st day after Biden is sworn in trump { he doesn't deserve the capital T} will say how much $ he lost while being pres then how big his companies grew cause he'd been   strongest &amp; most powerful pres ever &amp; his presidential library will be 2X larger than Obama's.
President Trump is ad spending to defend 2016 states. Biden spends money to flip states.   via
Biden echoes Obama from 2008 in bashing Wall Street.   That stuff is political gold.
I have been listening to Joe by speaking about systemic racism. It sounds so refreshing that we don't have to hear hate you can look at this man listen to this man and know you can trust this man.  I can't wait for November 3rd Joe Biden has my vote.
This election 15% of your supporters plan to back Trump.
It'd be nice if your supporters endorsed Joe Biden. But instead they plan to vote for Trump or no one at all.
And Bernie fans are planning to make sure Biden does NOT win out of spite.
The Sanders fan's plan: vote for Trump to spite Joe Biden. Worry about that, because none of this matters if your followers are going to keep these people in power.
Introduce legislation to stop your fans from supporting Trump over Biden. They're not the same and you're all fools if you think we're better off with Trump.
Pathetic is hiring people you let speak publicly saying Biden is as bad as Trump.
Bernie has people working for him who think Biden's as bad as Trump. If all Bernie fans feel the same way it means 4 more years of President Trump.
I can't imagine how ANYONE can still support Trump!! Thank you for always asking the tough questions every chance you get!! There is NOTHING, short of Biden shooting someone on 5th Ave, that could make me change my mind! #RebuildWithBiden #ToxicTrumpMustGo  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Thank you VP Biden!! Looking forward to dignity, empathy &amp; justice returning to the White House!! #RebuildWithBiden  #VoteBidenToUniteAmerica #BlueWave2020
sorry can I pay $20 not to paint a bullseye on my chocolate forehead   should be wiping member rolls rn. Joe Biden abt 2 keep ALL the policestate toys and decimate the DSA/BLM/abolishICE/defundpolice as soon as he's in office, if Trump doesn't win.
#Trumpkillstexas Biden it is in November...anyone but that idiot we call our president
Perplexed: Joe Biden who, after 30+ yrs has actually never helped the black community to prosper is probably gonna get their vote; whereas Trump has been employing blacks for decades &amp; as POTUS created the best economy that give us the low black unemployment rate ever. Go figure.
Why should Biden give fox any ratings fuck fox not worth the time
DNC Attendees Must Provide Negative COVID-19 Test Prior to Event
A lot of really sad robots on this thread. I can't think of anything stupider Joe Biden could do. So it probably will be her, since he is the dumbest nominee since Gerald Ford. This is two aneurysms stupid.
...BY VOTING FOR BIDEN
Fuck Kamala.  'Kamala the Kop' says she's cool with weed, but helped imprison more than 1,500 people on pot charges. I’ll still vote Biden but fuck Harris
Many of Biden’s inner circle just won’t forget and forgive Kamala’s surprise busing attack in that first debate.  But ... since 1944, Democratic nominees tend to pick Senators as the VP pick at the convention.  The exception in 1984 didn’t work out (let’s forget  1972).
Joe Biden: Get Joe Biden to Publically Endose $2000/month Emergency UBI Until Crisis is Over. - Sign the Petition!  via
I  forgot to add “not a warmonger”  Yeah. I’m still struggling, I don’t like or trust either. Trump did (according to a few source) attempt to get troops back home but, I don’t agree with many of his policies and his leadership is awful. Biden has no charisma and to me
Biden has the perfect strategy.....he needs to shut his mouth and let the dumb guy continue to shoot himself in the foot. It’s actually pretty funny to think Trump lost the popular vote to the most unpopular candidate in history and now he is going to lose to a guy with dimentia
This is big.  Biden bans staff from trading without approval.  These are bank level standards.   Very good!
I’m making the call: If Trump and Biden have to debate via Zoom, it will be half over before they realize they’re on mute.
IF Biden wins, he's a one-termer. Michelle Obama will be his Veep choice. Put it in the books.
Oh believe me Biden's supporters are VERY enthusiastic about removing Trump from office!  He is a serious danger to democracy here &amp; around the globe! He shows more support to Putin than a hero like John Lewis!! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace  #ToxicTrumpMustGo #PutinsPuppet
Biden has to get on one knee like Hank Paulson did with Pelosi, apoligize and beg for forgiveness.  That is the morally right thing to do.  That is the historically right thing to do.
OH MY GOD  Chris Dodd wants Kamala Harris to apologize to Biden for attacking his past track record of mingling with segregationists?!? And that is why he is torying with unqualified candidates?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
Yes. Those are all factors. And I admit there are people who wanna coast by with no hard work out in. I’m not saying Joe Biden can’t improve the situation for the working class. Though from what I’ve seen I’m not hopeful. Politicians don’t live in the same world we do anymore
Best part of a Biden presidency will be the complete and utter cleansing of these MAGAts from the whole of the government...
Puppet Biden will never debate President Trump.
His handlers won’t let him debate, either. Americans deserve better. Every presidential campaign has had debates, they won’t let basement Biden debate. Shameful.
Unfortunately we’re not going to win the battle against Covid until Biden is sworn in. Trump is a peon and thinks it’s just going to disappear. The science is clear. Other countries have shown the way.   #ONEV1
Thinking about making a BIDEN / TRUMP crossword along the lines of the famous CLINTON / BOB DOLE crossword, except only Biden's name will work in the grid.
In 2016, prediction markets were overconfident in Clinton relative to the 538 forecast, though some other forecasts were just as confident. This year, they’re super *under*confident in Biden relative to every forecast I’ve seen.
if you're endorsing Joe Biden for President, please don't! He's a CINO! he supports abortion, gay marriage, open borders to allow all the criminals in,&amp; supports Marxist/socialist ideology
Listen I really think you guys should give it up already everything you about Biden Tango double for Trump
Hey Tampon.  Err Tammy  Trump is the one hiding in a bunker when things get rough And gassing protesters.  Trump is a real leader.  ( eye roll ). Biden is following CDC guidelines.   And has a plan ready to be implemented.    Where is Trumps ????  Still waiting  !!!
Did you notice Diplo to play at Biden fundraiser?
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I’m Ridin with Biden
America is already 244 years old. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Joe Biden have been in government for more than half that time (150 years).  If things are so terrible, 149 years seems like a long time to spend planning a new direction.
Where is the error? I couldn’t find it? Educate us! I’m for Biden 1000 % but I can’t find the error and want to know!!!
Yes you have Linsey and thanks for endorsing Joe Biden for President!!!  The last words you spoke on both occasions that were authentic and real!!! Very sad for you, but more so for our country! You could have made a difference and you chose not to!!!
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
There was some polling done there where Biden was ahead
Donald - thats BS and you know it. Your father’s tax cut went 85% to the very rich. Joe Biden will NOT raise taxes on working class people like this video. In fact, he will give them at least as much tax cut as your dad. He will raise taxes on the super rich no doubt about that.
Person...woman...man...all voting for Biden.
#ICYMI: The former secretary of state and chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, endorses   for president and calls Donald Trump a chronic liar and a danger to our country. #LiarInChief #VoteHimOut #VoteBlue2020
Why do you want to give Trump any ammunition. Biden should just name his VP. Like Obama, I’m sure he’ll pick great people
Trump pretends to be presidential. Biden will be Presidential. #Biden2020Landslide  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS  #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
You had me at beat Biden off
Putting up a Biden sign is like putting up one of those signs that says "DEAF CHILD IN AREA"
Even if off a few decimals either way, why do we have a President who is making decisions about the livelihood and well being of the People based on righting his own sinking financial ship?  Is Biden or has any other Prez/candidate ever looked at the Presidency quite this way?
It's easier to figure out who DOESN'T support Biden now! Trump allowed us to become the most infected country on the planet thanks to his total incompetence! Now he went golfing AGAIN &amp; the Senate took a long weekend rather than passing the Heroes Act for suffering Americans!!
Let's look at the credentials of recent VP picks:  Tim Kaine - Senator and Governor of Virginia, population 8.5 million Mike Pence - Governor of Indiana, Congressman, pop. 6.6M Biden - Top Senator from Delaware, Chair of Foreign Relations Committee
But this is why Biden was the safe “progressive” choice. He doesn’t make anyone face any uncomfortable truths they aren’t willing to see... because he doesn’t see them either.
This is the only moment for which Rice is known for on a nationwide basis in the US. She is the Benghazi Liar.   Biden is going to look extremely bad and will confirm stereotypes of his senility (and lack of memory capacity) if he does pick Rice.   It'll be a Memento Moment.
The Biden campaign is going to start off very badly if Biden picks some no namer who has not done a God damn thing to earn a VP position.
The Biden campaign needs to get to work and start fixing those PredictIt odds tomorrow. You can't have random people with no national profile being bandied around as VPs. And hogging 40% of the odds.  Rice is known as the Bengazhi Liar. Nobody has any clue who Bass is.
Picking Rice would be a huge mistake. She has never ran an election or a campaign, articulated and sold a platform. In the event that she becomes President she will have serious credibility issues with voters.
This POTUS election cycle will be binary: Those who hate Trump vs. those who can see Biden is cognitively incapable of holding the office of the President of the United States.
What a shocker, well let’s move the golf game to my course, let’s have the g8 at my resort, and on and on like a James Taylor song! There is NOTHING he won’t do when money and/or re-election is on his wee little thing he calls a brain! Love ya Rachel! Biden 2020!
Perfectly put and sorry it affects you so strongly! I completely understand and agree! His fake narratives at the expense of Americans following orders are pathetic and illegal. Biden 2020!
Perfectly put! Donald J disinfectant is a commie lover and racist! He dreams that he can turn this country into the old USSR, and name himself “forever dictator “! Biden 2020!
Biden's VP competition
You know I was a bit worried, admittedly at first having fell into the fake incompetence hype narrative... but man has he come out swinging, with the competence and articulation of a man half his age! Biden 2020!
Why give trump play on anything? Ignore him! Dont spread his bullshit! If he refuses to leave Mr JOE BIDEN has the answer, "trespassers" will be escorted out.  BTW don't have him at inauguration.  The man is a coward, traitor, racist, mysoginyst, homophobe, antisemitic and..

I do not have faith in the Quinnipiac poll, showing you 11 points trailing behind Biden. However we must react as if it were the case. We can overcome if we fight back with all we have.
Except that Biden won’t be cheated out of the presidency.  Historic landslide coming for trump.
Chinese state-owned media outlets, e.g., China Daily and the China Global Television Network have expressed support for the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, a group of disaffected “NeverTrump” Republicans (swamp). Biden is the MCGA candidate. Seriously. Ya think people can’t see this?
Pretend u plan to give $ to BLM......follow the trail to where the donations actually go..... U will see 😳😱😱🥺 It is a front   The fact the Biden is a crook, just a side note here, and to the media ....not important  🙄🙄
If Biden was linked to Hillary she would be mentioned instead. Obama blew up his voter coalition and Clinton seemed to have no interest in putting it back together.

Lol....you're killing me Dinesh ! Dinesh: " It's hot outside"   Biden: "Make sure you wear a green shirt" ! 😄
I can live with that. I agree I'm the same. I will be voting for Biden, but I respect your right to choose without being hated for it.
You’ve already destroyed it. Biden will bring it back.

Only thing I think about Biden is that he’s not Trump
Apparently with their fear of Joe Biden in a debate with Trump, it looks like Trump will be debating an empty chair this time around. You know he will make it happen.
That’s a joke right? The left sees Biden as a hammer and sickle? That couldn’t be further from the actual opinion of joe Biden.  Who’s trump lite
