Biden at the new libtard rally!
If the election were held today, would you vote for Donald             Trump or Joe Biden?               Donald Trump277,078(79%) Joe Biden 66,716(19%) Neither 5,106(1%)
Yes, Biden better court Republicans like you if he wants your vote...Fuck right off. Your party overwhelmingly supports Trump. That's your guy. The democrats don't need to pander to you. Fix your party instead of trying to fix the other to suit you instead.
Montana kinda looks like Joe #Biden sniffing Idaho.
At this point, it dosen't matter If it's Trump or Biden. The oligarchs win.  still has a shot. #HowieHawkins2020
China and Iran want Biden.  Russia wants Trump.
Oddly Bill ( nothing’s too bizarre for  any more. He’s so desperate that he’s scraping the bottom of the pickle brine vat just to find something new to toss out at Biden and America. #ConsequencesForTrump #ChristiansAgainstTrump #ChristiansForBiden
The intelligence community warned that rival nations once again are attempting to influence U.S. policy &amp; elections in a variety of ways, declaring that Iran wants to “undermine” President Trump while Russia is working to “primarily denigrate” former VPJoe
Democrats have always been full of empty promises!  Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
This election makes all the difference in the world. Vote Biden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am short of 5000 followers and I've lost about 20 since morning.  Not many compared to some, but a lot to me!  Maybe the are dropping a % each time we say something pro-Trump or anti-Biden!
So why are the Postal Unions backing Biden then?  I know facts are your enemy but come one Pocahontas....
History professor who's been right about every president since 1984 reveals his '20 pick
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
Intel officials tell Congress that Russia is spreading false information about Biden
US Intel: Russia trying to boost Trump, denigrate Biden
It’s called a Joe Biden moment! Blessings  🇺🇸😂😂😂🇺🇸
He wouldn’t call that criminal if Biden did that. If Biden tried to have church at a casino because casinos are open and churches aren’t, no one would say anything bad.
Lindsey Graham, and the GOP. ODNI:Russia doesn’t want Biden to win. China doesn’t want Trump to win.
History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
U.S. intelligence has assessed that China is hoping President Trump does not win reelection, Russia is working to denigrate Dem Biden &amp; Iran is seeking to undermine democratic institutions  National Counterintelligence Security Center.
I needed to read this today.   Hawkins/Walker will probably not be on the ballot in Oklahoma and I’ve been torn. I don’t want to vote for Biden.   I can’t be mad at this reasoning.   Thank you, Beth.
Steve. Trump's main demographic is white males without a college degree. College educated Americans favor democrats. Biden's support ranges from young people, to white suburban women, to LGBTQ people, to Muslims, from capitalist Bill Kristol to radical socialist Angela Davis.
Lead on Mr. President...and apologize for attacking Biden’s faith, you erred.  Your big enough to admit it.
I hope that you are wise enough to know what is right and what is not. Research Biden and his visits with the Venezuelan dictator along with the chinese dictator. Also look up the definition of fascism. Have a good day!
Keep to the issues and no disparaging remarks about Biden’s faith.
You never know. Maybe Republicans who otherwise would have voted for Trump could in turn vote for Kanye, it doesn’t HAVE to just affect Biden. Although. I DO NOT support Donald Trump in any way, shape or form. He’s a criminal whose based his life off of cheating to get ahead.
What a statement!  “I certainly can’t vote for Biden, but am counting on his VP to run things!”  Amazing.   You seriously think either will be running things?!
I'm scared. Does the constitution protect our God from Joe Biden hurting it?!
Yet black people still vote the same way for decades and expect change. Democrats don't even consider you opinions because they know they have your vote. Biden said it himself several times now hahaha.
I can’t help shake that I would still be disappointed if he picked Susan Rice she brings absolutely no enthusiasm and has no campaigning experience ......but I’m sure Biden is about to “snatch defeat from the jaws of victory”....
Trump can’t walk down a ramp. Biden shouldn’t be worried at all. Trump wouldn’t pull that stalking crap behind joe like he did with Hillary
I don't care who Biden picks.  I'm still voting for him.
Okay, I was going off the post. Either way, if he’s leaning towards those policies and a supporter of Trump. It would still in theory hurt Trump more, than Biden.
Biden already saved the economy once and your daddy rode his coattails. He can do it again even though your dad has us in a much bigger hole.  Don’t destroy any documents. The FBI will be visiting with you soon.
I’m just as curious as anyone else, but Biden could nominate a turtle and I’d still vote for him.
But trump "did" say, "Biden doesn't deserve the black vote..." because of his gaffe.  I would express that the media didn't say that, trump did.... ijs
ha ha ha!  We're NOT talking about African immigrants! LOL     Nonetheless, Kenyans are different than Nigerians as they are different from Ugandans - which is the point Biden was making;  there is no monolithic ideology among a specific race;  the diversity is what matters!
Biden said all black people are the same (with some notable exceptions) 💀
You know nothing about Catholic Faith. Biden is a heretic. Abortion infanticide same sex marriage socialism. Contraception. You are an ignorant idiot. A mortal sin for  a Catholic to vote Biden
So why is Biden hiding from Trump?
Biden faces backlash for comparing diversity in African American, Latino communities
Biden will probably just keep his cool and not get into an argument with trump because will turn it against Biden if he doesn't say every word perfectly when even trump can't do it but that's okay with trump cuz he's president
Notice I said “One dumb thing” and not incredibly racist thing every time he speaks once a month. I wish Trump wasn’t the better choice here but if you think Biden has what it takes you are either willing to risk our entire country to get trump out or you are blindto what you see
And if Biden says something racist every time he speaks that is an issue. Democrats go through Trumps many speeches and tries to find one dumb thing he says and light it on fire and then pour gasoline on it while most normal stable individuals is watching dems do this like “WTF?”
Yeah that’s what I was saying about taking everything he says at face value. I agree that’s a ridiculous thing to say that he has done more for Black people than Lincoln but thinking highly of ones self is a whole lot different then the shit Biden says.
Tr*mp is just Biden on coke
When you flat out say “I have to have a capable VP because I might not make it.”  YES BIDEN IS A #TrojanHorseCandidate
I wonder what Dana Loesch will think of this? No question if Biden gets in the 2A will be done away with.
It doesn't get any better than this. Joe Biden is getting in trouble for asking a black reporter if he was a junkie.
....but if he’s on the republican ballot how tf would he be hurting Biden? He’d be splitting Trump votes 😂
There is only one African American culture and country? I can think of a few different ones. And if Democrats are going to take everything Trump says at face value then people with a brain are inclined to take everything that Biden says at face value.
Even Kanye has named his VP.  Where’s Biden’s VP?  Oh I forgot... he doesn’t even know where he is or what he’s running for.
Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
Biden talks a good fight but never delivers.  His inactions are hard to understand until he talks and says what he really thinks.  Conclusion:  he lies a lot—Another BS Democrat!!
Don't forget: He just makes stuff up as he goes along. Biden will have a challenge calling him on such a torrent of lies.
Biden is too demented &amp; delusional to recognize the implications of announcing “black woman”  as a prerequisite for the VP position.
Biden thinks Jobs was The Apple Computer guy!!
No. Way.  I refuse to believe that the MSM would run cover for Biden...🙄
Ha! How so?  Biden’s VP pick will be glorious. You say he’s done nothing but was part of an administration that pulled us out of a recession.  Now the country is on fire!  You can’t ignore the fact that Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing.  So many lawsuits
But to the Biden campaign’s credit, most of us asked Trump’s team to take his phone away years ago.
Trump Is Anxious That Joe Biden Is Going To Pick Kamala Harris For VP  via
I agree. As long as people acknowledge that there are significant Biden problems.
How many time has biden touched children at church?
Hello President Trump. We love you in Oklahoma. Do you know that the election is going to be stolen from you ILLEGALLY by the Democrats? (1) Biden is NOT going to debate you. (2) Biden is SKIPPING his own Convention. We all saw this coming....
Me neither.  I wouldn't put it past him.  Meanwhile, Biden is still trying to figure out which foot goes in which pant leg.
Here is the tweet you deleted:  Kanye West running for Prez is one of your most ignorant and blatant attempts to interfere and manipulate the election to try and pull votes from Biden. People aren't stupid. They know a vote for West is a vote for you!   VOTE #Biden2020
Serious question. Y does trump &amp; Biden only take Adderall for debates &amp; not all interviews? Trump blusters &amp; rambles with filler phrases not allowing the other to talk, while Biden mentally stumbles not being able to form a coherent sentence desperately waiting to be interrupted.
One of your most ignorant and blatant attempts to interfere and manipulate the election is to have Kanye West try and pull votes from Biden. People aren't stupid. They are going to show up at the polls to vote you OUT!  They know a vote for West is a vote for you. VOTE #Biden2020
If you don’t vote for Biden because of who he picks, then down deep you are looking for a reason to vote Trump.
Joe Biden, Susan Rice, and Seal Team Six
Agreed. Very prepared to call out Biden for using tokenism and intersectionalism in the place of egalitarianism. Hope he picks someone qualified, regardless of race &amp; sex. If not, I’ll use your words to describe him.
And you’re suggesting g that trump is?   The difference my friend is that Biden will rely on advisors and his cabinet to let our country with him as the leader.   Trump has Jared and Ivanka but uses his failed real estate experience to make critical decisions.  And he lies!!
I think we can all agree that Trump doesn’t come across politically correct and maybe he isn’t right for the role of President.  However, Biden is in the same boat.
Cardi B has doubled down on her support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
I see Biden has found his VP for 2020...LMBO
In a Desperate Rant, Trump Nonsensically Says Biden Will ‘Hurt God, Hurt the Bible’  via
There will be a downturn in ADOS support, the economy was doing very well before the pandemic &amp; Biden will fall apart in the debates against Trump. They’re both gaffe prone but Biden is on a whole other level when it comes to on the spot debates.
Can joe biden not say something fucking stupid for at least one week
Biden ain’t winning anything. This is not a close race.
Biden ain’t winning, people. Please use common sense and stop following CNN.
Hillary was up in exactly one outlier poll in all of 2016. Biden has consistently been up by a point or 2 for a month.
Beto only lost by like 2.5%. Trump won by 9% just 2 years before that. 2 years is a lot more young people who can vote, a lot more suburban women realizing flipping from R to D, and a lot more people from out of state moving here. I'm not saying Biden will win, just that he can.
It will need to be a long add.  Or Can just make several and just rerun them over and over.  That way many will think all Biden does is make goofy assertions and his racist attitudes will become vote changers.
Kanye West indicates he is running for president to siphon votes from Joe Biden so his buddy Trump will win.
Exactly...oh and Biden happens to be an idiot, so there's that.
Under Nancy Pelosi’s and Joe Biden’s
If Joe Biden chooses Susan Rice as his vice presidential candidate, she will likely face questions about what she did and who her clients were during a little-known stint as a consultant.  via
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
There’s no way this isn’t going to backfire on Trump. Nobody who votes for Kanye was ever planning to vote for Biden.
You’re not black if you don’t vote for me” got everyone in a dither. Biden half heartedly apologized saying he shouldn’t have been so cavalier or a wise guy.”
Biden spoke at an all black church and told them in a black accent “They’re going to put ya’ll back in chains.” Or how about when he was peaking at a 7/11 store and told the small crowd there “You can’t walk into a 7/11 or Dunkin’ Donuts without hearing a slight Indian accent.’”
Definitely not Biden lol
Biden speaking for us at the UN?   Trump is a genius compared to this idiot !   I can’t believe the Dems backed him ?  Shows they are total idiots
Biden with the nuclear codes. ??????   🤮. Scare the fuck out of me.  He’s nuts.
Joe Biden = Jerry Sandusky.
You mean Biden?
It was flogged endlessly when Obama was later saddled with Biden as veep. Party had to show the base it would "put him in his place", and Obama had to play along to get along.
Ilhan Omar and Marxist Angela Davis have endorsed Joe Biden. (Communist Party USA leader as well)  The Leftists have accepted Biden as a vessel through which to pass their policies. (Especially since the platform is more Bernie than Biden)

There’s never been a more  inherently racist candidate than Joe Biden. Any person of color, or minority, that casts a vote for this corrupt and evil man, deserves to live with the consequences of their decision. Joe Biden, and family, are corrupt to their core!
If you're riding Biden--you're on the highway to hell.
Has Biden ever trended 1.5 million?  This seems big.
Joe Biden’s Doing Such a Poor Job, Not Even Meghan McCain Can Commit to Him
If you think for a second Joe Biden typed these tweets, you are crazy as much as he is!!
Trump attacks Biden for not being a real Cristian. Who is it that really thinks any of these guys fucking "believe" in stuff.  The fact that most politicians are college educated means statistically half those assholes are lying.
Biden will beat Trump, says historian who predicted every presidential race since 1984
Is Biden even endorsed by the  ?
Joe biden is a real true blue democrat racist
Biden's campaign responded that his faith is "at the core of who he is."
I would say you have no proof of that for 1 &amp; I would say there someone who loves China more like Biden is unworthy.  Let’s not focus on actual facts little fella
Biden is a Nancy Pelosi Catholic. She prays for Trump while fighting for Planned Parenthood.
If it wouldn't be such a Pathetic Circus, I would like to see Biden DEBATE TRUMP on *Christianity*!!! Trump would be shown to be MORE of an embarrassment than he ALREADY IS NOW!!!😂😂😂 #TrumpAmericasEmbarrassment
It’s ironic that you mentioned bankruptcy when joe Biden fathered the bankruptcy bill, and also that I have seemly nothing to offer yet I’ve brought up real policy and you’ve brought up nothing but “TrUmP bAd So BiDeN gOoD”
Jesus Christ, I love America lmfao. I hope his dick riders are ready for a historic landslide loss
You are on another level of stupid, just because I don’t like Biden does that mean that I suddenly like trump, if I could vote I’d vote Biden because Trump is terrible but that doesn’t mean Biden is good and in fact he’s poss poor
Biden is a good man but that would be a stupid move at this point. Trump wouldn't do it for him or anyone else and Trump deserves not to get away with everything he's done
trying to stay out of prison trying to keep hunter out of prison and cover obamas criminal ass for a few reasons and the fact biden would walk across 100,000 dead baby bodies to be President
Holy crap you know that if you run on something usually the rest of the party falls in line right? Like if Biden was to support defunding the police most elected Democrat officials would get behind it, also you can use an executive order to legalize marijuana nationally
joe biden is running on the anti American anti police platform anti American anti police platform can yiuy freeking believe this shit but it is EXCATLY what joe biden is doing
Show me a Joe Biden rally!
Yeah and Bernie admitted that he was wrong in that but guess who won’t even acknowledge he was wrong? Joe Biden, Jesus who doesn’t want to end a racist war on drugs? Joe Biden, guess who wants to INCREASE police funding? Joe Biden so just stop you have nothing policy wise
Trump this trump that, how about you tell me what joe Biden has on his platform that’s better for the people then Bernie? Oh you can’t because you’re a partisan hack that believes in blue maga
Biden helped increased mass incarceration of black people, Joe Biden can’t simply support Medicare for all in a pandemic when 60%+ of Americans support it or idk maybe supporting defunding the police or legalizing marijuana which 80% of the party voters support? Oh he’s a hack
Alright lol keep pretending that voting out trump will fix the issues when joe Biden is an awful candidate who doesn’t even represent his voter base
So agree. The fact that we only have Biden and Trump to choose from is truly unbelievable in a country our size with such qualified and good people in it!
Mr. President, respect VP Biden’s beliefs in God.  We all differ a little.  Respect that.
I gotta admit I’m starting to like Biden already. He gives me a good laugh.
BIDEN: DEVOUT🙏☝  TRUMP: REAL DOUBT👎 😂😂😂😂
A vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for trump. It’s not hard hard to understand. Grow up, Meghan.
Ummmmm...... That's exactly what Biden was talking about.  (You did watch the video right) ijs
No, but it does mean, hey come one socialism! Your welcome in America, because that is what will happen with Biden. Sure he’s a moderate but he’s losing his mind and it will allow some far left VP to run the country. If it happens you all can thank never trumpers for it.
Joe Biden plays a giant eagle with domains in jobs and middle class.
And if you elect Biden, Americans will never have hand sanitizer again. The hand sanitizer people told me they'll only make sanitizer for the Trump Administration.

The battleground is in California for Donald Trump it is a battle ground          And he will win that one that’s what          I’m looking at I did look at this on Google it is very very important for COVID-19 that is a battleground it is not for Joe Biden. Donald Trump sets up
As much as people hate them, I think polls are still the only thing close to a legit predictor.  Either way, everyone should just vote as if their vote counts because it only does if everyone does it and feels that way.  Getting more worried about Biden VP (might be susan rice)
It’s ok to think Biden isn’t sharp and quick on his feet when speaking, but don’t pretend Trump sounds any better. He doesn’t make sense a good amount of the time and he repeats words a lot. #SleepyDon
Lay out truth for the 2020 voters of what occurred.  DOJ-FBI-CIA-NSA-Obama &amp; Biden-Hillary-Rice—ALL instigators &amp; coverup artists wanting Trump to be illegally persecuted &amp; crucified. DISAPPOINTING BUT EXPECTED—THEY WERE UnAmerican FOR 8 YEARS. NO WONDER HILLARY LOST HER EMAILS
Yes, yes it does. You cannot hold conservative values and support Biden. You need to rise above your hurt feelings.
I never asked about Biden’s tax returns. I’m just talking about him in general. But all anyone wants to talk about is Trumps taxes lol. As if that makes you fit to be president or not. When in reality I already told you that taxes are theft and unconstitutional.
Well the new Senate and House take office on Jan. 3 I think. I’d wait until Biden has won and its after Jan. 3.. then impeach him and Barr.
I’ve seen a good amount like Mike Seigel but I think it works to the advantage of our movement to have people of color as our nominees because a lot of people in the Democratic Party will vote for nominees strictly based off of what they’ve heard or their skin tone, like Biden
Juan is falsely representing Catholic doctrine.  Biden has openly condoned abortion. He is in the state of mortal sin. Not a practicing Catholic
someone on the Five needs to correct Juan about Biden’s Catholicism.   A practicing  Catholic would absolutely NOT  support abortion, at any stage.  Because he has openly condoned abortion, he is in the state of mortal sin. He cannot participate in the sacraments.
The prez says Joe Biden will "hurt God," making Biden only the third man in recorded history to harm a god, after Heracles and Diomedes.
On July 13th, Biden was up by 8.8 points over Trump, and today he's only up by 6.4 points.  In the last month, Trump has narrowed the gap by 2.4 points.  Good sign!
Old rambling UNCLE JOE (STALIN)BIDEN
You have got to be kidding me?  I KNOW I say that a lot due to statements by Trump.  Joe Biden actually GOES to church. Not just for a photo op after gassing Americans. Remember, Trump had a photo of Biden praying at church in his ad. Trump can't even quote his fave scripture!
Yep. Good old Uncle Joe(STALIN) Biden.
I mean .. the TIMING of it.  People JUST lost #unemployment benefits and #Biden.. while doing nothing to help checks happen, posts a video showing off his #corvette #car.. do you really think he won’t be absent weekends like #trump is?

Damn you all. Once again Trump uses an official WH event as a campaign stop...lying about Biden and God. This from the man who never goes to church. He will be paying for a lot when he meets God face to face.
While people are literally being evicted and losing money to eat, #biden is posting ads showing off his #corvette, talking about #beruit, and telling everyone to buy #American.. which is suddenly ok, since a #Democrat said it.  What he didn’t talk about this week is a stimulus.
I doubt it'll even be a shadow presidency in the vain of Dick Cheney.  Even if Biden makes it through the presidency, the VP (Susan Rice) will do all of the talking unlike any VP we've seen before.
Whatever Hiding Biden. Go back to playing with your dolls in your basement gePEDO!
Thank you Eddie for your change of heart. Please also consider voting for Biden. He’s a good man.
Also, is this really the kind of person Dems and left leaning Independents wanted to vote for!? I feel like it mainly comes down to Biden being familiar and part of the much loved Obama White House.
It’s funny because Trump is def not a believer in any faith and Biden is a practicing catholic
so the plan is to keep biden hidden as much as possible and hope the anti-trump energy fuels his win, okay, now what is the plan for the next 4 years should that happen?? unprecedented puppetry brazenly displayed.
Joe Biden is going to kick puppies &amp; take candy from children.  Jason Miller said so.
Biden is most coherent when he's saying incredibly racist things.
A Dem talking head on Fox trying to justify what Biden said, she's black and said what he said was in-artful!

Whatever, liar. Biden follows the constitution, unlike you. The NRA is a crime.
Yeah, except Biden is a pretty devout Catholic and has a solid record as such. Trump will literally say anything to pander to people who don't have the comprehensive intellect to understand they're being played
This is why I get frustrated when the conversation gets shutdown regarding Biden's fitness for president. I'm expecting him to be much more presidential than our current dude, but if i didn't feel like America was on fire, this dude would not be getting my vote.
Joe Biden continues to run against Joe Biden.
I understand your reasoning. But at the end of the day, a Democrat that will vote for Biden’s semi-progressive policies or stop Trump’s conservative policies &gt; A Republican that will stop Biden’s semi-progressive polices or enable Trump’s conservative polices
For Republicans Joe Biden is simultaneously a sleepy old man who can’t remember what year it is and an existential threat capable of “ hurting God”
The presidential candidate favored by China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, Antifa, BLM and the rest of the tyrannical leftists is Biden.  You're worried about a flea when you are about to be run over by a rhinoceros.
Did lightening strike him after he said that??  Either that or did the flesh melt off of his bones?  The most evil, racist, bigoted, sexual predator that ever walked on two feet dares to question how much Joe Biden is devoted to God.
Next he’s going to say Biden has personally performed abortions
🤬 YOU SUCK. JUST VOTE FOR BIDEN!
I can’t disagree with you there. Because I’m sick of all of the conflict of interest and corruption within our govt and congress. But again, why are we deflecting from Biden? As if Biden is a superior human and candidate? Atleast Trump is the lesser of the two evils.
Because we don't need debates for this election. We know to vote for Biden and to throw you out. Easiest decision ever.
Are you kidding me? Is Biden trying to lose this race on purpose? He is telling the truth that the Black Vote is essentially monolithic.
Mr Biden...You don’t even know you don’t know.  It’s plain to see.
I do agree...it's detrimental to Biden's cause and gets the backs up of the Trump sheep.
Who gives a shit about taxes dude? Taxation is theft! It’s UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Why are we deflecting to trump when i mention how terrible Biden is. Dude is incoherent.
Leadership is not gauged on a reaction to an annoying interviewer. All of the media want to trip him up on his words and make him look bad. He’s a world class leader because he gets things done. Biden would choke in this setting, and he hasn’t gotten anything done in decades.
Let's see ... when Biden was in the VP spot, did 160,000 Americans die from his inaction? Were 30,000,000 people out of a job? Were people rioting in the streets from coast-to-coast? Wake up, try to pay attention. The country is in ruins &amp; it is ALL TRUMP'S FAULT.
Keep Trump not Biden bad for USA
That's very likely true, but Biden still wouldn't be able to do anything about a state's prosecution of Trump.
So... yeah, idk what to say here others then Biden has kinda started doing the Trump/Michael Scott thing of starting a sentence and not having any idea where it’s going.

Oh how so true. President Trump is ready for the battle to begin. I think I heard that Biden wants to make sure he can take notes to answer from because he can’t think how to answer questions without them. Lol to my understand only. Lol
I dare  to have a "debate" abt the Bible! Biden would wipe trump out on a debate abt it &amp; only thing trump would be able to do is mutter "ppl are saying","ppl have told me", "I hear there's some guy in it who does some pretty good things, but, eh, I can't relate"!
Because we made up our minds over a year ago. Everyone wants you gone. I will send mine as early as I can for Biden.
If Biden gets in you will hear them bitching from now on. I’m not real religious but I think the dems are Satans little helpers
Had to actually hear the clip itself in context before I believed it, but Joe Biden literally said all Black people think alike.  I'm disagree. My two Black African born grandchildren don't think like all Black people. What racist thing for the former V.P. to say.
And that's the only way Trump and the republicans would have a case, but they don't want to give up their power to spy on the DNC (which they did with Biden) and the American people. This was an incredibly stupid political move on the GOPs part.
The ad, titled "Better America," also takes a direct swipe at Trump, without mentioning the Republican president by name.
Keep eluding to the fact that Biden is not a complete walnut. 👍🏽 deflect it to trump. That’s literally your only defense, and 90% of other liberals
Which is idiotic because the American people have no idea where Biden stands on important issues or his plans for America.

Now, if you want to abolish the NSA, repeal the Patriot Act and throw Bush in prison for so blatantly destroying the fourth amendment, I'm with you. But that's not what Trump is doing, because he still wants the power to spy on US citizens, including Biden
Imagine if Biden said the crap Trump spits out on a daily basis.

Their alternative would be Biden. Of course they’d vote for Pence.
Trump always accuses others of his shortcomings/crimes! Always! Trump makes Biden look positively eloquent!
Key question what President &amp; Vice President turned a Presidential campaign &amp; transistion into a criminal affair to thwart the will of the electorate?  Obama Biden.  You Dems are not safe after November.
What we are seeing IS trumps America.  Stop pretending that you know what Biden’s America will look like.

Lol okay. Biden cant talk and wont get out of his house. How do you expect people to have confidence in this man? Oh wait it's just someone other than Trump. Look at Jo Jorgensen for President if you have any doubt about Biden.
Insulting. Biden aint trump. Nor is he a child
Not surprised ...  Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
Yall would bitch if he were to hold a convention and you bitch because he is considering doing it from the WH!!!! Biden has even declined going to his and yall praise him...such hypocrites.
US election 2020 poll tracker: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden?
Oh my God you said Joe Biden cognitive and clarify all-in-one sentence. is that a triple double oxymoron. Lol
Whoever is running the Biden campaign, and keeps putting him on television, is a complete moron...
I promise you Biden did not write that!! 😂😂 His handlers did.
Not before your high level demorats, Hillary, Obama, Biden,DOJ, FBI  &amp; all the people they used as accessories wind up in striped suits for treason, murder &amp; a whole laundry list of crimes against humanity. #WalkAwayFromDemocrats  #Trump2020Landslide

Joe Biden Spins Another Epic Word Salad, Shows His Fealty to China In the Process
I will go with whoever Biden picks. But I don't want to lose a democrat held senate seat.
I am not voting for Trump.   In my red state, my vote has zero impact on the EC.  I will abstain on POTUS if Green isn't on my ballot.  You &amp; Chomsky &amp; Angel Davis do what you feel is best.  But NO. I won't vote for Biden.  #BestOfLuck
Is Bernie trying to stand in for Biden? He's everywhere, &amp; addressing everything.   Joes playing with his classic Corvette, &amp; accusing journalists of being "junkies".  What's going on?
Did Joe Biden write this?
Biden calls BLACK REPORTER A JUNKIE RODAY!!!
Biden calls BLACK REPORTER A”JUNKIE”.....After telling ALL BLACKS...”YOU AUNT BLACK UNLESS YOU VOTE FOR ME!”
Biden calls BLACK REPORTER A JUNKIE!!!👇👇👇👇
Are there actually Democrats who like Biden as much as MAGA likes Trump?  Or do they just hate Trump that much?  Asking for a friend...  (You have another option, look into Dr. Jo Jorgensen
If Joe Biden can prove he could put together a piece of IKEA furniture he has my vote
Biden calls “BLACK REPORTER “ A JUNKIE TODAY!!!!
Any Biden signs?
But please, not until after the election.  If Trump is forced out, Pence and Haley will crush Biden.
Biden is a FRAUD!!! Just like DEMOCRAT/MARXIST/FASCIST PARTY!!
Be careful what y’all wish for.  If Trump is forced to resign, Pence and Haley will destroy Biden (or Hillary) in November.
Biden says border wall construction will stop if he’s elected president | Fox News  he wants to put more kids in cages and traffic them
I've heard this since 2008 when Obama was elected, and I'm sure I'll hear it even more when Biden is elected. The only reason there'd be a chance of the economy "crashing", which I'd define as the currency literally dropping at least 50% of it's value, is because of covid
Biden is a loon
He’s trying to get his state to vote Biden. Vote out this Gov  we don’t have to obey tyrants or unjust laws. Dims ignore all laws of nan and God
I saw Andy get beat up by the fascists of Antifa.   Open your eyes.  You might see reality!   As Biden said today: hey man, are you on cocaine.  ?    Dementia speaks.
Truly amazing that we can see Biden campaign messages on tv but they don’t show any Donald Trump campaign messages!!!!! This is crap!!!!
I’d like to contribute my legal skills to the election of Joe Biden. Have gun, will travel.
Compare- "You ain't black" "are you on cocaine" or even "Settle for Biden" to an actual politician's idea of a campaign-
Waiting for your interview with Biden.
And you STILL would choose this dumpster fire Trump over Biden?  It's not politics anymore.  IT'S OUR SURVIVAL!    Cure the #TrumpCancer and eradicate the #TrumpVirus  VOTE #Biden2020
But never forget that Biden is a long-time sniffer . . .
Joe Biden reminds me of Bernie Lomax on the movie Weekend at Bernie’s.
Perspective | The real reason people object to Biden’s veep choices: Racism
Tired of hearing people bitch about Biden hiding.  Do you realize debates are already scheduled for next month?
So you do actually believe rumors from “anonymous sources”! 😂😂😂😂Yep , you really do get informed by Fake News Media! Baah Baah said the sheep 😂😂😂 btw...anonymous sources say Biden is mentally coherent 😂😂😂😂😂
I agree Candace.  Biden should pick you as VP!  Then resign!  You’d make a great president!
Daniel.....Biden is older than 46 😂😂😂😂😂 in fact he’s been doing nothing in Elective Office that long!  😂😂😂 No way he will be the 46th!!  Besides, he doesn’t even know where he is!  😂😂😂 &amp; you would vote for the empty suit 😳😏😏
Hell’s bells girlfriend, Biden does wake up in the Basement by 2pm.might be having his pablum by 4pm..😂😂what a loser!  40 + years in Office , fine tuning the art of bullshit for the gullible!  Thinking you just might fit that description!....just saying
In that instance, if Trump wins Biden is “automatically” second, so the exacta price will be the same as straight up:  Trump/Biden +175.  However, if it went Trump/Kanye, that combination pays 100,000-1
Biden has a lot of work to do to earn some votes
I am sorry, I lost my Biden decoder ring...what did he say?
Hahahahaha Biden should tell Trump if he wants that fourth debate or to have debates before early voting starts, he can release his tax returns or otherwise fuck right off
Remember, Biden isn’t “available” for interviews.
Hiding Biden probably has him hiding in another basement far away.
I wonder if we'll all suffer with some form of low-grade dementia if Biden's elected.
If Biden wins but I’d rather Trump win &amp; deal with covid19 🤷🏽‍♀️
This is why Trump still has a shot. I endorse
Let’s skip the cognitive test and have Biden and Trump answer basic questions about the constitution with no preparation.
Biden is nuttier than a barn rat.......he couldn’t run a sno-cone stand
Please, please, please ... no matter who gets picked for Vice President, promise me you'll graciously accept Joe Biden's choice and get behind them. Please?
Joe #Biden is sharp as a Tic-Tac!
It was a terrible bill. Horrible. Rs, Biden, the Clintons, they were all for it. But Dems have regretted their votes and worked to undo the damage the bill has done. The Rs have worked to keep people locked up. Easy choice, especially given trump's call for the DP for drug crimes
Hussein, Biden and Hillary were the ones that allowed the Russians to "interfere" in the election by paying for and using the made up Steel Dossier!!!!
Biden and his supporters are not out spreading the coronavirus. That’s the difference between me and you!
Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Are you that blind, Biden in office 73-09, VP for 6 years with a BLACK President, Polosi 1980 - present and you still believe their BS that they will do something new other than get richer? He and Obama did nothing for the Blacks or any other minority, in 6 years read real news!
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
Aren't you asking folks to vote for Biden?  What you stood for is WHY I still follow you.  Don't YOU rememve? You had me blocked; for a while.  I know your account.   Not my first time on the mery-go-round.
As much as I do love her and feel she was shafted, I don't want Biden to make her AG or anything because there will still be antipathy from people who voted for Joe. Make her an Ambassador.
Yet he will continue to hold rallies when the Covid smoke clears, because he needs them like lifeblood. He will never attend Biden's nomination...he will never concede..and he will never leave quietly.  He's such a tool.
This is just unreal folks.  There just aren't words for what these #Democrats are trying to pull off with the hijacking of this feeble and obviously ill guy. Wait, yes there are... coup d'etat!!   Jill Biden should be arrested!! His kids too. #FreeJoeBiden
Tucker going on about Biden in this regard has nothing to do with whether he poses the illegality of it. It is just so he can say the word "BLACK" in regard to who Biden will most likely pick...dog whistling to the base to BEWARE!! I'm an older white woman - I can smell this.
Look at Biden completing thoughts and sentences. When will trump start to do that?
On New Voter Registration in Key States, Trump Is Blowing Biden Out of the Water
November 3rd make America great again and vote for Biden.
Biden has always been a ... umm ... rough exemporaneous speaker, embarrassing gaffe-machine—he had a habit of stealing speeches for a reason—but now watching him compared to him from 2008, yikes.
Oh, no, it WAS a silly question. If Biden were polished and competent, he would have illustrated how silly it was.  And then Biden opened his mouth.

Joe Biden cancels plans to travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination
Joe Biden is pushing back at Republican assertions that he should take a cognitive test to disprove President Trump's claim he isn't fit for the Oval Office.
I agree with Joe Biden for once, he said he would stand with the President during the debates.
So cringeworthy   What a travesty and how ridiculous to talk to and about Biden as if he is normal.  😂😂😂
I’d rather see Biden debate Alec Baldwin Trump anyway. Let the real trump hide in his bunker behind two miles of fencing.
When are you going to debate Joe Biden?  After the Axios interview, I am so looking forward to it.  #TrumpIsASnake
I think that is a bad move by the Biden campaign. The people that will decide the election aren't overly active on social media. With only having an online presence for outreach, for the most part, it is destructive on reaching key voters.
He isn't saying Biden is. Or will be.  He's saying if WE make it impossible for him NOT to be; he COULD be.  Which differs from becoming ungovernable NOW so Trump MUST take action NOT A BIT.  It's just waiting to start.  Don't listen to anyone saying wait.  Not even to November.
Trump is sharper than Biden. I can't wait to see that debate.
No you don't! If its gonna be a battle of the incoherent, over 70 white guys, my money is on Biden! How is someone that spends 3 hours in the make-up chair, everyday, look and sound like a tangerine oiled, cat herder, trying to sell analog phones in a digital world!
Have you seen Joe Biden attempt to complete one coherent sentence?
He's planning on challenging  to push ups-he said he's very forward looking to having the American people compare his PHYSICAL &amp; mental health with the President!  Let's see, Biden's been in his basement since late February - President Trump has been out working!
By voting for Joe Biden!
For America to SURVIVE, and NOT be in Total Ruin, BIDEN MUST WIN!! I''m NOT taking it for granted!!!🇺🇸💪😎✊🇺🇸
A) Because she is an eloquent educator and a part of Joe Biden’s team B) She will NOT waste OUR $$ on tennis pavilions and Wedt Wing renovations during a pandemic
I didn't know Hunter Biden was doing interviews these days...🤔
yes pretty strange that not long ago it was democrats always holding down blacks, now its democrats always telling blacks how they should think.. see Joe Biden if u dont vote for me u aint black
...and didn’t have a problem with Biden saying you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him over Trump.  That’s why the left will never be taken seriously.
Rice—Another dumb decision by Biden.  Mega promises and no effective recommendations or decisions—likes Bengazi fiction and CYA MEMOS to file.
Biden will be heart attacked shortly after taking office.
thats some Joe Biden level rambling there 🤔
Let them go.....I think some states will want to leave the union if Biden wins. America is in bad shape!
People are so ignorant. That’s not stupid it’s ignorant. If they vote for Joe Biden. Or you vote for emotional reasons, instead of business that’s ignorant.
i’m not shilling for joe biden my guy, i’m pretty sure that’s you
Why are the dems trying to keep  from debating  Before you site covid as an excuse, remember this could easily be done virtually. Joe Biden will be destroyed in a debate. That’s what the dems are scared of. #2020debate #trumpbidendebate

Buck cherry has a song about Joe Biden ..

Biden -185; Trump +175. Get your bets down
Republicans trying to prop him up in every state to take black votes from Biden.  I think Black people are too smart for this.
I'd vote Beavis before Biden.   Butthead &amp; Trump are both no from me.
.  CALL  AND TELL HIM #THEPEOPLE WANT YOU AS THE #VP!!!  #WakeUp #BIDEN!!!  Don’t you want to win by a land slide?
no, you should vote for Biden if you ever want this virus to be manageable!! Only vote for Trump if you like seeing more Americans dead every day with no plan of how to get out of this terrible mess!
Whatta Mean “We'd be lucky to have Dr. Biden as our next First Lady.”  Dr. Biden WILL BE OUR First LADY!!!! #strongwoman #PositiveVibes  #futureisbright
I made a bet with a Republican friend that if Trump is re-elected I have to do this. If Biden us elected he's just gonna jump off the bridge
This insane bastard...Biden is one of you, Robert. Get over it. He's far more Christ-like than the likes of you.

I’m looking forward to the Biden Trump debate, aren’t you?
Just voted for Biden
⁦ says, that on Election night, if votes start heading more towards Joe Biden, he feels that Trump, will try to let halt and litigate the votes.... just try to stay in office!!  What a NIGHTMARE!!! #AxiosOnHBO
Biden, like all Modern Democrats, doesn’t have any ethical principles other than say anything and promise anything to get elected—Power is all that matters.  Must get elected first, so any strategy desired by the powerful top Democrat cabal can be pursued.  Promises don’t matter!
I’m ready for that Biden and Trump debate.
What is she running for?  Biden doesn’t even have to talk anymore.  WTH is wrong with him?
You really think he'll be their candidate? If they force him to resign, Pence and Haley will destroy Biden. Then they'll take all the credit for getting rid of Trump, and will be hailed as heroes by the forgetful voting public.
#CreepyJoeBiden is going to have a woman VP.. because Jill Biden said she wouldn’t be able to handle the job working with another old white man! Re-elect  #1A #2A #WalkAway
Biden reminds me of Pinochet- but it's appearance based only.
I sincerely could use a few more followers.  I've been on here since Dec. '18.  Love Obama, Biden, tan suits, Marines! (am the widow of a Nam Marine), sticking it to Trump and his minions....I'd like to follow more people who feel the same. Will follow back after vetting! TY
I'd like that to be true. It's a hell of a stretch.  But, I don't expect either Trump or Biden to be on the ballot.  Certainly, almost 0 chance of BOTH making it.  Even our pitiful excuse if a political system won't survive that.
With only 91 days until Election Day, Trump &amp; Biden have rolled out their plans for housing, hoping to win over suburban voters.
Biden—SOP, another Democrat not carving.
Joe Biden's Energy Stance.   #pipeline #energy
Actually the previous two have mattered greatly. Iraq and torture were Cheney's babies. Dub just went along. Biden was the point man on our economic recovery from the Great Recession.
I have the same birthday as my president, Barack Obama and I’m voting for my other president, Joe Biden. 🎉🎁🎈🔥
That’s why Biden doesn’t need to interviews. Why get in the way of someone destroying themselves?
Ummm if you open your eyes, you will see that I was commenting on someone else's comment asking  "what does Biden have to do with this"...? I wasn't comment on the issue at all.
Tucker: ‘Probably Illegal’ for Biden to Only Consider a Black Woman VP  via  PICK ME JOE I AM PART BLACK QUOTE HILLARY

I literally said NONE of that. I was only pointing out that Biden is actually a huge part of this. Come November, people are either going to be voting for Trump or Biden. My argument is only that Biden and Trump are BASICALLY the only options at this point.
Amazing how you and Biden have one main thing in common- both of you have become rich on the ones that voted you in.

Patricia, give up. Mike is not going to change his mind. You presented excellent points and he just shoved them aside. He's lucky he lives in a state with a Democrat governor. He even bragged about it. Let's wish him luck and good health and call it a day. #Biden
Instead of debates between Biden and Trump, how about a spelling bee, or maybe a game of "Are you Smarter Than A Fifth Grader"?
I challenge your premise.  His donors are MORE evil. Trump is MORE evil. Biden is MORE evil. Cheney &amp; Romney are both MORE evil. Pelosi &amp; Schumer are both MORE evil. The Koch's are MORE evil. Soros is MORE evil.  That's not the point.   The SYSTEM that made them is the MOST evil.
A baked potato could beat Biden in a debate.
Let's swap Jareds in November: Dump useless Jared Kushner for Jared Bernstein. He is a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and from 2009 to 2011, he was the Chief Economist &amp; Economic Adviser to VP Biden.  Suggestions for Biden cabinet openings?
Media liars and democrats desperately trying to hide Joe Biden. They know he is not mentally able to debate. Knew this was coming. 👇🏻
I don’t know, but after the Axios interview I’m ready for a Biden/Trump debate.
you used biden and sane in the same sentence, you need to be mentally evaluated just like him.
Biden has everything to do with this? The election is coming up and EVERY SINGLE liberal celebrity is posting shit about how "bad" Trump is. Why? Because they want him voted out and the ONLY OTHER person that could possibly win is Joe Biden.
How can anyone watch Joe Biden and think he is going to be a good leader...? That man doesnt even know where the fuck he is and cant even put together a coherent sentence.
I’m saying if  on the ballot in swing states helped Biden, the ILC (Ivy League Caucasian’s ) would be screaming “systematic racism” over ballot requirements - as the do for voter ID requirements.  It’s about winning and pawns in the game.
the people supporting biden are out on the streets rn tearing up major city capitals because of a tragedy that happened months ago. russia has nothing to do with trump but go ahead believing some conspiracy, ya look like the perfect guy to support those claims.
That's what happens when you get old and senial  that is Biden. Stupidity: nomination of an America hater.

The key question is: does Trump endorse them? In the case of the communists, Biden and the democrat party do support them BACK.
Ain’t that special, Maybe Putin can do speaking tour with Biden.
Once again the Democratic establishment is trying to shield VP Biden from scrutiny or the American Voter.
After the Axios interview, I believe Biden and Trump should debate. What do you all think?
Joe Biden will be elected!!!
Yeah, nope. Ridiculously bad idea that would gain no one and turn off most everyone who wants Biden to win.
Do you think we will get to see Biden debate President Trump?
Don't cry. You'll get Obama II in Joe Biden if he manages to get elected.
"whether it's worth debating Trump"? Lol Dems know Biden isn't good at debates
Because Biden knows he just has to stay silent while the President makes the case for Biden every day when he opens his mouth, just like that interview yesterday.
Trump says his administration has the coronavirus under control. Do you believe him?  He says mail-in voting leads to fraud. Do you believe him?  He says electing Joe Biden will destroy the country. Do you believe him?  I wouldn’t believe him if he said the sun sets in the west.
And...the  wants THIS GUY to debate BIDEN!  Bring it on!
Biden: “If I’m elected president, I’ll spend my Monday mornings working with our nation’s top experts to control this virus — not insulting them on Twitter.” #VoteBiden2020
Susan Rice will volunteer to debate Trump and expand on Obama-Biden lies.
This guy is an IDIOT &amp; doesn't know what he's talking about ! He wants biden in so he can control this country ! #GodBlessAmerica #GodBlessPresidentTrump
Even if Biden refuses to debate Trump they should still hold debates. Let it be a 2 hour question and answer session between the moderator and President Trump, with an empty podium for Joe.   If you aren’t willing to attend the interview you don’t get the job. #HidenBiden
A Biden presidency will completely destroy the oil and gas industry. No fracing would mean no oil, no gas and everyone walks to work within a couple of months.

Biden is a centrist candidate. The majority is excited to vote out extremist Trump. Hard to get excited for a stable, middle of a road guy.
has Mrs. Biden on today.  Do you think she will have the nerve to ask Mrs. Biden why she is putting her husband out there for this torture?
Or the 36 that came before.  Biden isn't decent. He's a segregationist corporatist sociopath.

Biden assails Trump for 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail
There’s gonna be a ton of shit, but what’s the 1st thing y’all want Pres Biden’s AG to investigate come Jan ‘21?  I’ll go 1st.   Who paid off Kavanaugh’s... • $92,000 country club fees • $200,000 credit card debt • $1.2 million mortgage  ...and bought a SCOTUS seat?
When William Barr was Attorney General the first time, he wrote a report called “The Case For More Incarceration”   VP Biden authored the largest crime bill in history  If you want to continue having the top incarceration rate in the world, vote GOP/DEM  If not, vote Libertarian

Yes, that’s true and has been in the plan way before the Bushes. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Communism, New World Order and more. If you want Liberty and Freedom Vote for Trump!
Trump is trying to convince you Biden is senile. You do know Trump suffers from dementia, slurrs his words, cannot complete sentences. Bring it!
This will be another one of those things republicans regret if Biden is elected and I really don’t want to hear them whine about it at all- particularly Inhofe.
I dont need a debate to vote biden. Looks like biden holding all the cards. He should demand  live fact checks and no slander also checked live
No surprise. Must be who HidenBiden’s camp and DNC are selecting as their actual presidential hopeful. Biden is only there for name recognition.

Maybe Biden has the silent majority?
As with many things the Biden campaign does, it negates the other side's advantage. Right now Trump is saying that Biden is "afraid" to debate him.  A single debate solves that. I also think Biden would benefit, being a rational and sane voice debunking Trump.
We think the Trumpers and Maskholes are bad now...wait until Biden wins...and watch what happens when the little Trumpers refuse to wear a mask in school....

If Biden doesn’t debates him he can do a national town hall event with clips of Biden saying the answer to the same questions. After one of those Biden will have to come out if the basement to answer.

Let’s see a debate!!!!  Bring Biden out of his basement!
Imagine that. Biden easily goes back on his word. #IncompetenceKills #Biden2020 #Trump2020
have you had  on your show to discuss things like you are having Mrs. Biden?  Asking for a friend.
Why does  have to debate  People who watch the debates already know Biden has dementia. If  excellent works can stand on their own, debates won’t change that. Who is most capable of getting us back to where we were?  without a doubt
Biden has nothing to gain by a debate. He can only lose. His base will vote for him either way. Some of the weaker Anti-Trump supporters could be pulled away with the poor performance Biden is likely to give.
Biden is going to win by a landslide
Only idiots vote for more taxes. Oh I forgot. A large portion of Biden's base is on welfare. They don't pay any taxes.
I wonder if Biden ordered any cardboard cutouts of random people to fill seats at his next basement rally?

Hello Joe Biden I give 15$ a week for your campaign. I just know that you will win.
My current thought is in sept. The indictments will get Biden and pence. The dems will demand a new convention and delayed election like trump just foreshadowed. Convention ends Nov3 like Rob said the other day. Landslide win Trump /Jr
Try doing your own job, Joe Biden will be great!😷👍
That’s like saying Biden is like Kennedy.
I want to watch dump get his ass handed to him in a debate with VP Joe Biden
The Biden camp is waiting to see which potential VP will be indicted. DOJ waiting to see who Biden chooses before indictments. It’s nice to have TRUMP cards to play.

How funny...  All I did was voice that, while I'm not voting for Trump, I think that he's better than Biden.
It doesnt matter who he picks for VP. It only matters we support Biden no matter who he gets. His VP pick could be 'Sully' George H W Bush's service dog as long as Trump goes to prison I don't care.
That's entirely irrelevant to presenting things that are happening on the ground.  I'm voting  and I personally don't think Biden is any better than Trump (Worse, imo)
I’m grateful that we have a person who can potentially beat Trump. Biden needs to.. work on poverty (no hand outs just hand ups) COVID-19.. Veterans...Equalty...the justice system. This country is a mess, we can do better. I believe that Biden will calm the waters.
Ummm....Trump didn't do anything to race relations though. That was the democrats "trying to get the black vote" including and especially Biden. Figure it out.
She was 62 when she put out that statement.  If she isn't lying (Which I think she is), then she's just admitting to be incredibly ignorant.  Either possibility disqualifies her from Biden propping her up to be the real president.
They need to get recorded video of them answering questions or something. America needs to see Biden as he is.
Biden probably ran out of choices but too bad; he already committed.  He's actually trying to pick a President as he won't last 'til the swearing in.

But I thought we weren't a democracy, we were a "constitutional republic". So shouldn't your argument indicate a vote for Biden is a vote for America, if America isn't a democracy?
He hasnt done anything in 44 years so why would he start now?  When will you all realize, biden is a life long political crook?
Lets face it, Biden is done. The only thing at this point that might save him from a killing blow is if he asks President Trump to "Save Martha".
I guess this assumes Biden dies by November and the Democrats pick their nominee in a back room?
You don’t have to sell me so hard, my dude. I’m already voting for Biden.

I can’t decide how to feel until I see a poll that shows boater support for trump vs Biden.
Excited to see Biden’s pick for the new VP. Looking forward to seeing positive messages about the future of our country. All is good! VOTE!✌️🙏👏😘🎊
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is our time to show strength. We don’t need to question his choice.  He made a list of strong list of candidates. This is our time to show Trump we are behind Biden! So put on your big people pants, wash your hands, pull up your masks and let’s do this!

yeah buddy I one hundred thousand percent agree with that they can not hide out its stupid but then so is biden his handlers know he is a walking disaster his past is coming back to show who biden really is a real racist in his heart and mind he was off limits as vp for obama
An aside: Biden himself wasn't announced as VP until August 22 of 2008.
At least it’s not a tweet of lies.  I sincerely hope Biden has a team that coordinates his tweets with policy and action.   All we get from trump are lies and divisive rhetoric.   His staff is constantly trying to cover his lies and bizarre tweets.
Anyone shocked as I am that the Biden Campaign hasn’t floated Condoleeza Rice as potential VP?
You’re kidding? Sanders is at odds with Biden. Most uf us are voting against Trump, not for Biden. Biden is a centrist, slightly right of center. Don’t paint him as a progressive. He will, however, save our Union and our alliances worldwide. US must lead and not retreat.

Ok well Joe Biden won’t be running the country, it’s obvious he’s not there mentally
If Biden doesn’t agree to cash reparations for ADOS before November 3rd then he can kiss goodbye to the White House. We haven’t forgot what he said years ago &amp; recently on the issue of reparations. The days of tokenism &amp; symbolism are over. No tangibles or substance = NO VOTE.
How nice that you think we can survive another four years of Trump. Democratic Socialists have been a real disappointment. At least Biden can READ. Has a working understanding of what governing looks like. WE CAN SURVIVE HIM. What we won't survive is another 4 years of Trump!
My mind's already made up. But would be hilarious to see Biden try to debate  That's where COVID lockdown/small crowds comes in, maybe. Idk. What I'd LOVE to see is a LAW forbidding corrupt ppl running for public office!  cc:
Obama-was he our Neville Chamberlain- He signed the Munich agreement which was the great appeasement to Hitler. All weak leaders want to please everyone and Obama and Biden are 2 of the worse.

Then I guess they will be choosing Trump over Biden. That's the way to further their agenda now, isn't it........
I hope  will choose Senator Harris or Ambassador Rice...both well known, both tough as nails, and both ready on day one.  Biden is surrounded by good people.  I will support his choice, but hope it is one of these two. I think we learned from the Tim Kaine choice..
Ask yourself how many Ds voted for Trump's DoD budget.  How often do votes pass/fail not by party line; but based on who benefits.  That's not going to change under Biden, it wasn't different under Obama.  The game is over. It doesn't work anymore. We 👀 the con.  #BestOfLuck

I'm a progressive, or possibly democratic socialist (Hivemind Collectivist isn't feasible). One thing I'm not is a real Democrat. I'll vote Biden to beat trump. But the Clinton's are Republicans in the eyes of many progressives, having her speak doesn't bring much but division.

Um, not sure what fantasy world you are living in.  How do you think the debates will go? Have you not seen Biden try and give a simple interview?
Sorry but not voting for Biden is a huge mistake,more trump is death for people who are out of the womb
I think if pence/biden gets picked up in the September indictments then they will have to have new conventions, Delay election, new conventions end nov 3rd. And thus time line is a maybe but jr....? One can hope.

No, but I think it would be a wonderful display of Trump’s dementia. If Biden does not debate, Trump will hammer him with it (while being damn glad he,himself didn’t have to debate!) joe can take care of himself!
Okay then we basically agree one point at least. No two points we both want to aid in economic recovery, though we differ on how to do it. Dude we aren't going to change each other's minds about any of it. Imma vote Biden cause lesser evil but I'm a Hivemind Collectivist.

The witnesses described Trump’s attempted shakedown and bribery of a foreign official for providing media  clips that would damage Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Mob tactics. Same stuff he did for decades in New York. Republicans just shrugged.
He’ll simply recover the taxes you cut for your billionaire friends and the tax cuts you gave corporations to “build new Factories”.  As it turned out, they just used it to buy back their own stock.   Biden’s taxes won’t impact one middle or low income American.

If you’re a conservative and you vote for Biden your nothing but a liberal. That’s the platform he’s running on. I’m fully aware of the shit trump says that isn’t true He’s rude and cruel and I couldn’t care less when the alt is the lib policies on coming if Biden is elected.
Biden will listen to advisors before acting.  He won’t tweet nonsense and most importantly, he won’t lie.   I’ll take a few of Biden’s miscues over the incompetency and lies from Donald trump.
RD, I doubt that you’re a billionaire so you don’t have to worry.   In fact, if you think about it, as an unemployed dishwasher level employee, Biden will be more beneficial for you and make those food stamps more available.
When Joe Biden finally makes his VP choice...and, people say they can no longer support him for President... will he change his mind just like he has on everything else he's said before?
We all know Pedo Biden didn’t type this he can’t even think clearly
I’m not saying this to argue, but people voting for Joe need to fully evaluate his VP pick first. If Joe wins, “she” will be your president within a year. Joe won’t be capable. To most Biden voters, this doesn’t matter. Whatever it takes to get Teump out is their thinking.
Biden is the weird uncle you avoid being alone with; &amp; Kamala is the sadist older cousin who all the adults think is "responsible" (so they always leave her in charge).
The Obama admin was literally the worst administration in the last 100 years I don’t see how anything Biden says couldn’t be used against him. The trump admin has an edge in literally every avenue. Hopefully the loss will allow the left to restructure.

AND this wasn't about the funeral it was about 4 years ago - where Obama stayed way out of the Campaign as did Biden. l
It wasn't a campaign speech and he never mentioned Trump. Funny that he never mentioned Trump but everyone on both sides knew exactly what he was talking about. And it was about the chaos in current leadership - and he's thrown his support to Biden, he's allowed to support Biden.
Such fools! Has this dude seen a Trump rally? 😂😂 It's definitely not 10 people falling asleep, Biden is a puppet
Tell me how Obama/Biden encourage this kind of behaviour and they are good in your eyes? There is a cure for Covid19 but they wont let drs prescribe it, who do you think is the true enemy? Obama at the Wuhan lab for  "Bat" project. They can't be the cause and the cure.

I'm really not in favor of Biden picking a Senator, we need to hold all of the Senate seats we can. Other than that I'm cool with whatever.
Whoever Biden picks, I’m all in. I’d like it to be Harris or Rice, but I’m there!
Really? Abrams, Demmings, Rice. I don't think white supremacy would pick them. Relax, I think Kamala is still the VP. I trust Biden to pick the right one to help win.
My money is on Harris. Biden needs a prosecutor on this campaign. He's not good at it.  She is. The only question would be is whether she would be a team player.
My daughter is turning 18 in September. She has already filled out her voting registration as a Democrat. She will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
I think you are underestimating how many people find Biden extremely comforting, maybe more so because we’ve had 4 years of trauma with Trump. Biden was WAY down on my list, well behind your top picks (who were up there for me too). But Biden soothes people. He projects kindness
Never forget that you are actively calling on Americans to hit other Americans with their cars. Americans who, by protesting, are expressing the fundamental rights people like you think Joe Biden takes away.

Me too. But, I'm abstaining on POTUS.  Biden hasn't earned a vote.   Oklahoma Elector selection won't have a different outcome without my input.
I'm kinda sad knowing we may have heard the last pitch for Raimondo from Mike if Biden picks his VP next week. Oh well, we'll always have Chicago.
I don’t think Biden will fall for it. He knows he needs somebody ready on day one so I’m thinking Harris or Rice.
I’m sure Biden’s people are aware.
Support for a party is one thing but I do not get the worship! Trump supporters flat out think he can do no wrong. Ask any Dem &amp; we will agree w/ u on the many flaws of the Clintons, Biden, etc. But any disgusting thing Trump does is either the media’s fault or “out of context”🙄
SUBURBAN IDIOTS FOR BIDEN! Cause we be STUPID!
At least there are no Biden supporters there....whew!

According to Trump, AMERICA IS GOING TOO HELL, if joe Biden wins Election this year. Even the guys behind him were looking around, shaking their heads in disbelief in what he just said!!! #trumppresser #Vote #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpThreatensAmerica
Please when Biden becomes President. Please please do not constantly berate him on the news. Anything he does is going to be 1000% better than Trump.
It’s because Biden is a fellow white man
The subpoena demands all the records the department has turned over to Senate committees that are investigating Hunter Biden's work for a gas company in Ukraine.
The one good thing this time around is that Biden has said he’ll pick a woman of color. Leading the media to talk about many women of color who typically get little national coverage.
Still not sure why  hasn't officially picked  as his running mate yet.
Joe Biden is the definition of a moderate. He has no leftist policies. He won’t push for any leftist policies. It’s a lie.
Reading comprehension? He is saying that Biden has been pulled more left than BERNIES PEOPLE THOUGHT. NOT further left than Bernie. Geez you should apply at CNN
Rep. Karen Bass of California has emerged as a leading challenger to be Joe Biden's running mate.  viaSo uS intelligence has reported that now Russia is interfering trying to get trump to win and China is interfering trying to get Biden to win. What a circus.
Then Congress gains a few more members like Bernie the next few years. Then we get a slightly better Biden after that. This change allows Republicans and centrist Democrats to adjust and not raise to in arms like GOP did with Obama. Unfortunately you can't slide into a black prez
Yeah, its how human history has worked for centuries. The problem is that the American ideal is to demand instant gratification. To compare to other topic, we don't want slightly better Trump, we want Bernie. But politics has never worked like that. So hopefully we get Biden.
Your have said worse and still on the hunt. I don’t give a fuck what Biden does. You gonna go. Then go to jail
Yeah SCOTUS seats are the only thing keeping this relevant for me. But at the same time, Biden is likely to pick a moderate person to take RBG seat, who honestly should’ve retired in 2008 but I guess we will say
Hearing from several GOP sources confirming that Biden has murdered God with a shovel given to him by his dad. Expect official RNC announcement soon
You are so right. As an independent. I would've loved to see Biden/Kasich ticket. I mean. Why not???
Biden will be better than Trump thought He was!
what did you say about Obama giving a Biden campaign speech at a funeral? Oh, nothing huh?
Based god Biden
tRump is MOST CERTAINLY NOT THE ANSWER! Anything is better than this corrupt lunatic! We need to restore dignity, peace and decency to our nation! Biden will do fine! After 4 years we can go from there! #RepublicansAgainstTrump
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
How quickly do you expect Biden to win the Nobel Peace Prize?
Biden/Harris ticket!
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
I thought that months ago but I got over it. If Biden gets pulled they will pick Clinton.
Oh no just like all you biden followers saying his racist comments over the past week is just misinterpretation so thats all this is was just misinterpreted
Bruh who are you talking too? I’m not against Biden
Omg! Do they think we are that dumb? Good luck ! We are for Biden and we don’t want to die..
I think 🤔 Joe Biden should release his VP pick. Just saying cuz if it’s Susan Rice we might be in trouble Dems #khive #SusanRice #Republicans
Oh my bad I thought you thought ignoring millions of voters was the conspiracy. (That is obviously a given) The DNC isn't going to switch out Biden. His VP is going to be the president when he steps down. So no bait and switch like you suggest.
Ana Navarro is not a good person. If she becomes the face of the Biden campaign.... I think that's a wonderful idea. This is just a hateful, mean, nasty person.
Joe biden says the stupidest things everytime he opens his mouth how can he realistically debate you sir and hope to win
I HATE biden with a passion but at least hes easier to shame into doing the right thing with enough backlash
seth rich was robbed by a stranger. LIE. veganism is environmentally responsible. LIE. acid rain. LIE. God is a woman. LIE. margarine is healthier than butter. LIE. y2k. LIE. clinton foundation wants to help haiti. LIE. biden is just affectionate. LIE.
ight…on a real note, please give me a good reason to vote for joe biden, i need to know why i should vote for him
One day I hope JayZ and Beyonce, just as examples, are held to account for their human trafficking and gun running in Latin America. Go GI Joe!
This statement cannot be clarified or walked back. He literally made it clear and unambiguous in the original. This is who Biden is.
Joe Biden, your grandfather’s Republican.
Even his ads are mentally compromised. I’m Joe “we’ll build back and build back better” Biden
"I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy," Biden said. "I mean, that's a storybook, man."
I'm black and I'm ready to Build Back Better with Biden
Biden lies
Biden campaign should make an effort even in the solid R states that are next to Toss-up states.
Well we know pelosi isn’t prayerful for trump I don’t know anything on biden but funny he hasn’t condoned the burning of bibles if he’s for god
This white (as opposed to White) person is for Biden ALL THE WAY!
The VP candidate could be Joe Biden’s pet ferret for all I care, I’m still voting for the only chance we have to get cult 45 out of office.
it’s so funny how if trump said this democrats would go crazy but since it was biden that said it all you see are excuses 🤣🤣

The Dogs have it right; Their owners are voting for Biden!
Cativist, are you prepared to eat cats, if Biden gets into office?
Joe Biden isnt going to the DNC. He atleast has to debate Trump twice which he wont.
Yepp. I just dont think we have enough for this election but I refuse to let trump win. I may hate Biden but ill take that anger and ill use it to motivate me
Neither are you!! 1. Shithole countries  2. We are a hate group  3. You want to protect the suburbs from black people bringing house values down.  4. We are terrorists  So far Biden has apologized but you seek to divide.  5. Suppress votes.
Heres my logic. I DESPISE biden and the thought of voting for him makes me sick but right now we need damage control. People are dying in droves. Once we get rid of anti christ trump we need to keep this amger and momentum and show biden were not stopping at trump
They only ever loved him for what they could get with the Biden name. They’ve all got to get what they can before he’s declared “no use” to them by China and Ukraine, right Hunter!
As much as it sickens me. Yes. I dont think we have enough radicalized to afford to split the vote yet and that could put trump back in office however biden is easier to shame to the left or at least shame into silence than trump ever could be.
He is definitely declining. I’m pretty sure they have Biden locked in the house like people have to do with Alzheimer’s family members. Sad!
You really want Biden in a situation where he has to make a split second decision with your family's life on the line? He's going to nuke Kansas by accident he openly doesn't respect black people and he's scared to even talk to his own ... Be honest with yourself
Joe Biden is literally the stick bike meme personified.
Yes, elder abuse! Mueller was just the face of that BS, just like Biden is the face now. What’s scary is -who’s pulling the puppet’s strings?!
Yes, where are the people that are supposed to love him? His wife, obviously she is cruel! Jill Biden is a poor excuse for a wife. Sad and disgusting!
Joe Biden is both articulate &amp; reads well. He does flub words and panics, probably from his early stutter.  Trump’s reading skills are abysmal. I doubt he even knows that word. When he speaks, he often doesn’t form complete sentences &amp; is difficult to follow.  It’s word vomit.
Why did the audience clap at the town hall meeting several months ago when he called the guy “fatty” for just asking about Hunter Biden and his enriching himself off of his Biden name?
His wife is a terrible person to do that to him. Shame in Jill Biden.
He’s always gotten by with his BS gift. Gift jo more, just dementia. Shame on Jill Biden, what a b*tch for a wife. Power hungry!
Jill Biden can’t rest until she’s FLOTUS. It’s shameful, disgusting, and sad to watch. They have plenty of money to retire and go away. She’s a cruel wife!
No, it’s not funny, it’s disgusting, and it’s horrifying to watch Jill Biden march Joe Biden out into public for her own benefit, has she no shame?! Terrible!
You, Jill Biden, should be protecting your husband since he is obviously experiencing dementia possibly Alzheimer’s, instead of of parading him in public for your own power grab. Shameful!
The ONLY reason im voting for biden (that sentence still makes me wanna puke) is becasuse if we split the vote i dont think well win and biden is easier to shame into the left than trump is
Take it back lord knows biden cant
Anything is better than comparing that to a regime that caused so many deaths and pain for survivors.  The brutality cannot be compared to anything. I would never compare Biden or anybody to something like that.
Are we sure the people who would vote for the pro-life Christian capitalist rapper who’s been wearing a MAGA hat for four years were reliable Biden voters in the first place?
Joe Biden isn't worthy of the Mexican vote. But, because of the manufactured hatred of the president, and decades of conditioning, Mexicans and the Black community will vote Democratic Party.
She’s guaranteed to not bring Biden across the finish line first! Then we can hear her squeaky voice for the next four yrs bitching about election fraud
Anyone who thinks joe Biden wrote this is naive to a fault. Arguing that he even read it is a stretch...
Biden doesn’t make you cry? Seriously? What are you not paying attention to?
Three hours and only one like to your comment. That's what it's like when you live in a blind society and believe socialism is better than a republic. Watch your freedoms go down the drain with Biden.
So what? Trump never accepted the endorsement. The premier of the CCP endorses Biden. But I'm sure you're proud of that.
I can see that. I never said Biden wasn’t racist either. Even if he picks a black VP.
Then it shouldn't be a problem for Biden to debate him! What are the dems scared of?
All these people bitching and whining about “I’m not gonna vote for  Guess you want 4 more years of the dipshit currently squatting in the White House ?  Jeez.  Biden was not my first choice but he’s a good man with a good heart.  I will vote Joe !
ABC, NBC, and CBS Run Defense for Biden, Edit His Racist Gaffe out of Their Reports  ...should the aforementioned networks be required to report their defense of Bejing Biden as an "in-kind contribution"...
Biden thinks it’s a train that runs on a single track.
Joe Biden has stuttered since he was a child. He has overcome it pretty well.
Why do you continue to hurl insults at Biden that really just deflect the same behavior coming from your daddy?
So, "I don't like your argument, watch me call you a racist!". Very effective technique of persuasion. I remind you of Joe Biden's words yesterday:
If Biden really can defeat God, we should probably vote for him cause he'd be the biggest badass in politics.
Oh yea!! Givem hell
Biden is gonna win. Then Kamala is gonna throw black men jail.
I agree. Right now i dont understand politics cause i avoided it so long. Im learning noe though all i know is people are dying and while biden is blue trump hes more responsive to backlash. I just want people to stop dying so we can organize and finish this ince and for all
Joe Biden addresses African American 'diversity' gaffe  ...does America really want a President who cannot be trusted to go out into the general public...
My logic behind voting Biden (that sentence made me throw up a little) is that we NEED to get rid of trump. Biden is just blue trump but hes more responsive to backlash. If we can get biden in office al then hold onto this anger &amp; revolutionary momentum we can end this for good
Cardi B has doubled down on her support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
If Biden wrote it: Earlier today, I didn’t know what to say to y’all and how much you were thinking about making love. I’m glad y’all are doing better today than yesterday morning sweetheart. I’ll try to get my truck ready to leave tomorrow afternoon and then I’ll call y’all.
Joe Biden did not write this tweet.
President: Biden over Trump, 324-210, +4% Popular Vote  Senate: Democrats 51, GOP 49  House: Democrats 234, GOP 182
Vice President Biden could have Pee Wee Herman as his VP pick and I would still vote for him
If trump and Biden should suddenly keel over, we could end up with Kanye as president. That would be so 2020.
It almost seems like there are those on the left who would go to the ends of the earth to tear Biden down enough to make him lose. And for what? So they can say "I told you so!"?
I agree, But I feel like if Biden is polling around 36% I think it can be close.
Surely, most people can see who Biden really is and that his prays are real and also should know not to believe anything trump says.
So should Obama stork biden clintons clapper comey vindman yates antifa cuomos de blasio pelosi shiff nadler
Biden had no idea what he said. Came back after they corrected him. Rehearsed his answer. And he still cant read it well. Ly'n Biden!
Would anybody even be surprise it Biden wins OK and Cleveland counties?
Plan B if Biden doesn’t win is getting to whatever person told Trump the story about the water pressure in their house. I mean if we could just get intelligence briefings to them, maybe some bits of the constitution, maybe we’ll make it fine through 2024
I bet Biden can say Yosemite correctly. Also, Thailand instead of Thighland!😂
#KIngTrump worships money, power, and fame oh but wait... He tells a crowd that “Joe Biden is against God”. Wow really ?
No one else could beat trump. So if Biden wins he was the best candidate. This country is still very racist.
Before we let Joe Biden retract (again), why did he EVER CHOOSE THE WORD "UNLIKE"..BEFORE SAYING "AFRICAN-AMERICANS"?  SOMETHING IN HIS BRAIN TRIGGERED THAT WORD.
You’re going with proven liar Biden? Good luck and brace yourself to eat Fido and little kitty. All these dem leaders have proven themselves not to give a damn about your liberty, they’re tyrants, dictating from their office. You’ve sold your soul to Satan.
...so he’ll make everything that you just mentioned WORSE. As he consolidates power into the executive branch and stacks the Supreme Court. I get the reasons why Biden is not ideal, but he’s better than Trump one literally every single issue I care about
Biden is a disaster. Even a coward ghoul like Sen. Cruz can clown him. A political party that had any credibility or decency would not only cancel  candidacy, but expel him from from their party. The  won't, and that's really all you need to know about their worth.
1.) Sippy is wrong on face here; any vote that isn’t affirmatively for Biden is a vote for Trump and all of the failure and cruelty and fascism that comes with that; but  2.) you click the link and I actually agree with her; so  3.) the answer is to never click the link.
I love Cupp, but this ain’t fucking hard— Biden is better than Trump, better is good. Especially when the alternative presents an existential threat to our country
If you were wondering why Biden shot down M4A, follow the money trail of his donors.
I never said that Trump is a Christian. I also didn't say that Biden isn't. I look at their policy choices and see whether they support Christian values or not and place my vote accordingly.
As a progressive I’d defy you to name one issue Biden, Harris or Rice isn’t between you and Trump on. Better is good
It’s fun watching Biden try to appease the lefty fringe. This guy used to have common sense and even opposed murdering babies, but now he’s always stuck trying to catch up.
Biden did do deliberately
When identity politics goes wrong. Joe Biden trying to hang on to the Latino and Black vote after today’s interview. #Trump2020 🇺🇸
So teens reserved free tickets to his kk_ meeting/ campaign rally. tRump has a toddler fit taking away income from our youth. Yep, every teen eligible to vote this year vote for Biden. He isn't a perpetual child.
Yeah if there went 20+ other examples of Biden "mistakenly" making racists racist statements.  I mean the guy didn't want to live in the jungle with black people
Lol we know that's not biden.  Its 2 complete sentences put together.  And yeah you said what you mean just like you ain't black if you vote Trump
I'll wait for the  and  morning digests to figure out what the #Biden hashtag was about. I clicked on it but 90% of the tweets were trumpet talking heads. They can't write proper English. Then there's Biden apologizing for something I don't have a clue about.
Nice try at redirecting the conversation back to Trump. That tactic doesn't work with me. You sit in judgement of him for breaking the Ten Commandments while breaking them yourself. Do you think Biden hasn't? Who says it's okay to break 1, 2, or 3 but not all? You?
Biden obviously didn’t write this. Keep the Segregationist in his basement.
I can’t imagine wearing a Lil’ Kamala tee shirt &amp; jumping on the Segregationist bandwagon like KHive. Maybe it’s because Biden had corporate money and didn’t need to ask them for donations that was so appealing. Still doesn’t explain why they are so obsessively angry with Bernie
West himself has hinted he may be in the race to detract from Biden. When it was brought up West responded, “I’m not denying it."

⁦ Problematic Record On Racial Justice, #JoeBidenIsRacist
Joe seems to always just be making a “mistake” when it comes to his racist asshole mouth.   It’s been documented since he’s been In politics 100 years. Just go back and listen. You can see the conviction in his face when he says the crap he says.
Imagine how much the evangelical voters would freak out if Obama said Biden could hurt God.
Tell me you did not just call joe biden woke
we were all told last week that THIS WEEK Biden wld announce his VP running mate. That WAS last week, right? Its Thursday August 6th.  So, what’s got the left in a tizzy y’all? They’re mad about something aren’t they? They’re Acting like it. Smh
I’ll prob vote for Biden depending on his VP because that is who will be president.  Have fun reading peoples minds.
Yes.  I don't want Biden. I never wanted Biden. I think it's utterly asinine that he got the nom over Warren.  But.  He's what we've got. He MUST beat Trump.  SO HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS GOB SHUT, PICK HIS VP (K. H.), AND LET HER DO THE TALKING 'cause she'll be better at it.
I THINK BIDEN CHOOSING A VP ONLY BY SEX OR RACE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF RACISM AND SEXISM!

is saying that all black people are the same, think the same,  come from the same, singular place.  C'MON MAN. In 2016 trump didn't pander to black Americans for their vote.   He asked for it for the same reason he asked for my vote. Cont.

Glad to see how serious some people take their right to vote. Biden can't get through an answer, intelligently. His (Or his puppeteer's) choice will be the President, if he's elected. No way he's capable of making it 4 years.

Dems know Biden is out there  If he wins by chance  He will be replaced by May
Call me silly, but IF Biden (who if I recall is a Catholic) were to try to “hurt God,” my money’s on God.
Perhaps, but never Trump is ignorant...trusting our country in Biden’s socialist hands is essentially never-Republican.
Biden's 'rallies'
Look I’m not what one would call a good Catholic, lapsed Catholic is probably more accurate, BUT what we are NOT going to do is go after VP Biden for being a devout Catholic. 😡😡😡😡
I'll give it 10 minutes before a Trump quote emerges.  I'll give it 10 weeks before anyone sees Biden in a public place.
Biden rivals Hillary for military strategy ineptness.
That’s pretty sick.  So, how do you figure out how to undo the damage to Biden.
Better to be pissed off than pissed on, my guy. Speaking of, were you as up in arms about R. Kelly’s verifiable crimes as you are about Biden’s alleged ones? Or is this whole thing really about the Qreepy Qult you’re in?
God damn Joe Biden sounds awesome
If you refuse to vote, I don’t wanna hear shit from you about trump for the next 4 years.   He’s gonna win because of idiots like you. AND IM NOT SAYING BIDEN IS A GOOD OPTION EITHER, but he isn’t Donald Trump. Grow up and quit acting like someone else is gonna fix this and VOTE.

You misspelled Joe Biden
God is kinda weak if Biden can hurt him.  I don't think Biden could hurt me.
Joe Biden needs to be interviewed a lot more.
There's your man, church. His profound knowledge and intimate relationship with God says that Biden will hurt God and the Bible. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
He is using our tax payer money to fly across the country for Biden hate speeches
I think Trump has slipped some from when he was younger like most people once they get into their 70s. But Biden is much worse.  He's approaching full blown senile.
So, are the schools going provide the masks, and make sure the younger kids keep them on for 5 or 6 hours even when they have sneezed or coughed in them.  This only makes sense to somebody like “ come on man” Biden !
Joe Biden is an ICE Democrat
Well I’m not voting for tRump so that counts as a vote for Biden considering Democrats’ logic.
Btw the way Biden just said the African American community isn’t diverse. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If we told Trump that God is omnipotent so Biden can't hurt him, do you suppose he leave the stage?
Hello fellow Republicans! Either you put up with our current President or your other choice is socialism. Your choice but I guarantee if Biden wins you’ll be begging for Trump back when we turn into Venezuela.

I’m not voting for Biden.... So....
Joe biden is racist
I've become so inured to bad news and doomscrolling that when I actually get good news I have a panic attack.   I expect to have a complete meltdown if Biden actually gets elected. Which is ok, in the end.
Not a single person voting for Biden can legitimately say they are voting for him because he is a good candidate...they are voting for him simply because it’s not Trump. 🤦‍♂️
Yeah, like how every other author “hurt” their imaginary characters. Biden is literate.
Twitter will ban  &amp; the campaign before too long. The #Biden left &amp; their evil media allies have declared total war, just like Goebbels did. No limits. We'll see some startling new outrages before November.   **Threats of secession from west coast feces states.
Republicans for Biden? What a freaking joke you people are!
You see, I am voting for Joseph Robinette Biden on November 3rd, *specifically* because he will hurt god, and hurt god very hard
WTF is Biden talking about? Mannnnn we gotta keep praying yo! Because if not we are in Barney Rubble... TROUBLE!!

You can't test the dead. He won't survive losing to Biden. It will literally kill him .
Well, I have never heard Biden take the Lord’s name in vain!
At a debate, Biden should do nothing but challenge trump to Bible trivia. What does John 3:16 say?  What was Joseph’s (Jesus’s dad’s) occupation? Who came before Jesus to prepare the way? What are the beatitudes? Etc.
What the hell is wrong with Biden... who could possibly vote for this fool?
Does that mean the Justice League will get Biden to help the next time Darkseid attacks Earth?
I agree, except there’s no way Biden makes it through a full year in office before he’s off to an assisted living center for bingo and lots of pudding.
FWIW, I think this is some awkward wording from Biden but makes much more sense in context:
Yeah ok hmmm lets test your theory out shall we, one is out answering questions and holding confrence after confrence after confrence and one hides in his basement. Trump is not affraid of Biden, Biden is going to get embarrassed if the democrats even let old poor joe debate
Biden couldn't even read your tweet without screwing that up for 10 minutes before actually getting it right.
Biden is coming for you!
You are so destructive and such a liar. I cannot wait to have President Biden in office.
I know you can't comprehend this but, unlike you, Joe Biden will obey the Constitution including the Second Amendment. I know you think this is for suckers but it's what honest and ethical people do, even if it's against what they personally believe in.  Because it's the law.
Did not know #Biden was this all powerful. He's been keepin his God hurting powers on lock.
"Unlike the African-American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things."  - Joe Biden, again showing why staying in his basement and not talking is so vital.
Share what you want, obvs, but maybe check someone’s bio and other tweets before sharing their stuff. Not sure why folks on the left would want to help conservatives hurt Biden with sketchy readings of small comments taken out of context.
Biden is specifically asked about TPS for Venezuelans vs Cubans being deported. He answers about TPS, and then mentions Latino diversity. Seems clear to me he’s talking about political (not ethnic) diversity, and some Latinos being more conservative on immigration (eg Cubans).
I see some conservative media creeps are sharing a short clip of Biden’s interview with NABJ/NAHJ to try to make him look bad. The full interview is here:  Relevant section is ~36 minutes, he’s asked about TPS for Latino immigrants from various countries.
Hiden Biden should stay buried in his basement
Still 2 old white men. Hopefully Biden stacks his cabinet with some progressives.
Maybe except for Pete Buttigeig but yeah of the Dems at least Biden, Butti and Warren are deeply religious where Trump seems to believe in nothing except money/Mammon
Joe Biden disgusts me.
Only thing that would make me pause on Biden is if he chose Ivanka and that pause would be very short.
Vote your conscience and principles. Even if that's not Biden or Trump and one of those two wins (as is likely), the winner not having your vote (and those of similar mind) still lessens any perceived mandate and has the potential of altering the future political landscape.
To all the military folks in the State of Oklahoma if you vote for  for president you all must be okay with Putin paying bounties for the heads of your brothers and sisters overseas! I so hope not!! Vote Biden as he will stand up to Putin instead of being buttfuck
Lord , I need you to send down better candidates for preseident... biden is just....i was raised to respect my elders but people make it hard.
Love it when Trump campaigns for Biden
Biden=Practicing Catholic 45 impeached forever=can’t hold a bible correctly.😷😷😷
I believe Biden just embarrassed himself, again, this morning. A racial comment.
Fuck I WISH Biden actually wanted to do any of these things
Such a potentially easy year for Democrats. Yet Biden gives them these kinds gaffes like he is trying to give Trump a run for his money.

Failing to understand why the car ad was Good, Actually, is why your entire movement and candidate fell flat on its face and you’re still spending your time each day Whining Online about it, while ignoring the entirety of Biden’s platform and the progressive input it’s received
They should have a debate BEFORE people vote because we to see if Biden is competent to be a president. Unless he needs to hide something. We shouldn't vote for any president because he's a nice guy, that doesn't cut it. We need a president to be ready to go on day one.
Me either. I’ve seen more Warren lawn signs than Biden. I was up in Wisconsin a week ago and saw a couple Biden signs. Nothing in Chicago.

So with that statement you are a Christ follower?  So Joe Biden want I ng to give everyone everything on the backs of working people is what you want. I get up at 4:15 every day and bust my ass until 4:00 or after and then go home to 5 acres of work. My choice but it took me 30+
I’m pretty sure Biden went to pay his respects to John Lewis at the Capital. Did your daddy?
Using  's example of refusing to debate  because everyone already knows who he is, Vice President Biden doesn't need to debate trump even once.  We all know who trump is.  We also know who VP Biden is.  Thanks Jim Inhofe for the tip.
Bro no one cares about debates. There isn’t one thing you could say to get me to vote for you. I’m voting Biden a debate won’t change my mind
Bernie’s way of fighting back was his voters and we didn’t show up in the numbers he said we needed. Unless you’re claiming mass voter fraud that 300 delegate lead Biden had and no path to the nomination I see no reason why Bernie would keep fighting when the Bros weren’t.
Biden said he would veto M4A and compared his VP vetting process to a car. Biden also said to “Vote for The Other Biden”.
I can see Trump laughing at Hidin Biden during the debates!
Fair enough.  Biden can be rather thick, but you're talking sense, here.  Thanks!
We aren't that dumb to vote for a man in the sunken place. He's a Kardashian. I don't believe Kanye will take votes from Biden. GOP thinks us blacks are ignorant and uneducated

Listen, I understand we don’t want that man having a second term. But Biden is just as trash, loves. Let’s just burn it
Yeah but that’s when all Democrats were against gay marriage. Remember when Tulsi was the first Democrat to endorse gay marriage? Tulsi beat Biden, Obama and Hillary.
Barr and Trump will bring the full weight of the U.S. government to steal the election.  James Comey Wrote a Letter in 2016. What Will Bill Barr Do?
I do not believe it was planned to show force.    As far as President Trumps faith is concerned that is between him and God. All I know is his agenda lines up with what I want for this country way more than Joe Biden or any of the other democratic leaders.

Mr Biden, if you feel so strongly about this issue, why don't you debate President Trump and tell the American people, that recently purchased AR styled firearms for their protection, that you are coming after those firearms and dont care that you will leave them defenseless.
Oh and I don’t reply to Biden because I don’t see his tweets in my feed..
Mannnn the whole strategy behind that is too siphon off votes frm Biden, Ye don’t have a snowballs chance in winning, but what he can do is take votes away frm Biden which in turn helps Trump
Biden socialist list. 1. Emply out the prisons. 2.single payer healthcare. 3.government paid child care. 4.the green new deal. 5.guaranteed basic income. 6.reparation.

🌟🌟Wouldn't it be the ultimate GIFT to America if millions of Biden voters mailed in their ballots early like Hillary requested, and then after the debates, the DNC was forced to replace presumptive nominee Joe Biden? 🌟🌟 🙏🙏🙏

Biden projected winner.
Susan Rice, Biden VP Finalist, Said Bowe Bergdahl Served ‘With Honor And Distinction’   ...we traded 5 GITMO terrorists for this deserter...fair trade?
Gingrich is delusional if actually thinks that. The fact the Democratic presidential candidate is establishment centrist Biden who is supported by national security hawks, ex Bush staff &amp; disaffected Republicans proves the actually reality of where the Democrats are.
I wish Joe Biden would show up on my private property and try himself to take my guns, he wont be leaving my property
Come get me when Biden's pro-Nazi and then we'll talk.
I'm hose, and this is good voter outreach for Biden.
Must be terrible knowing what’s coming, “cats,” on the menu. If you’re listening to Biden, you’re eating cat food out of a can, anyway.
Sure, will that be before or after Israel cash their DAILY $8.2 million check?  Mr. Biden to earn my vote you must acknowledge that our ‘allies’ are abusing the rights of my family in the #GazaStrip everyday. Not sure what caused the explosion, but how about all the others?
That’s such a clickbait headline “Overall, the poll found that 43 percent of voters would choose Biden in a present-day matchup whereas 40 would choose Trump.” - then they don’t provide actual information on white voters
Plus, if you spend three months and a hundred million dollars lowering the bar for Joe Biden he’s going to have to declare it as a campaign contribution.
It’s been a minute, but Joe Biden worked Paul Ryan like a speed bag and managed to kick Sarah Palin’s ass so hard that people thought he was an asshole.   This is not a winning strategy.

Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked ‘Aunt Jemima’ as his VP
Are you going to get 3-4 million black voters out of their houses to vote?  Right now, Biden doesn't have a brain (I mean, prayer-sorry).  His VP pick will probably not be a black's black women, so 4 more years of Trump it is!!!
There is a scene in Godfather I that I think would be appropriate during Biden’s inauguration. I don’t mean it of course...but I can fantasize.

We’ve got to stop saying “Im for/support Trump”  “Im for/support Biden”  “Im Democrat the repubs. don’t know anything”  “Im Republican the dems. are ruining everything”  We need to start saying “I am American” &amp; “I am for the people and the interest of the people” #ForThePeople
But the Dem retort is Biden is going to die in office
I don't understand badgering leftists about voting for Biden. I'm sure a lot will, but wasn't a point of backing the liberal centrist to bring in all those never Trump Republicans I keep hearing about? Get on the phone and lock those votes down.
Doesn’t matter, he was never going to win CA. They have the same number of ElectoralCollege votes if Biden wins by 1% or 40%. 🤷🏻

Have you met Joe Biden? Dementia is a bitc.   ....what was I saying?
If you’re such a genius, surely you already realize that the GOP is only helping you get on ballots to take votes away from Biden and help Trump get re-elected.  You continuing this nonsense will only help Trump and hurt minorities even more.
I don’t think they’ll let Biden debate in person. If they debate at all, it will be remotely. He’ll be in a room with a teleprompter in front of him telling him what to say.
Project Lincoln.
Dems don't want Biden to debate with Trump because you would see how unconfident he really is. It would stop the radical left to run our country. Biden is the worse dem to run for the dem party. I don't think he will debate with Trump. He won't expose himself. Protect  Biden!!

Are you still going to vote for Biden despite the Tara Reade accusations and tons of pictures of him groping women and young girls? Talk and action are very different. Also no one votes on just one issue.
Cool Biden needs to make more appearances. This is great.
So what. Watch Biden’s videos and you can see his diminished mental faculties.
Only Biden and woman praying? Yeah right
Biden got petty game. 😍🤣
Oh lawd. Now he's saying if Biden wins, he's going to be voted out for dementia, the VP is going to "mysteriously" die, and Pelosi is going to be the new President.
Which is EXACTLY what Biden has done...and the Ukraine sellout is on videotape...for GAWDs sake.
Or Biden’s just senile and they only let him out for a few minutes at a time when they’ve pumped him full of enough meds to allow him to form half sentences.
Biden family corruption is rampant and Trump family has no corruption. But keep lying to yourself

99.99% of President Trump’s supporters are just VERY DEDICATED. Not radicalized. They won’t commit violence for him—a that’s true with every fringe group—right or left. Haven’t you seen “fringe” Biden supporters? If you haven’t, you’re not looking.
Biden loves little girls
I have a parent with dementia. My dad is slightly a yr older than Biden. The squinting Biden does searching for words and his shuffle when he walks are red flags for anyone who has a loved one, who has gone or going through it now. The body has outlived the mind.
This entire thread is a clinic on people trying to intentionally interpret and twist things in order to manufacture fake dogpile outrage and make some pretty awful allegations — all because they’re Mad About Biden. It’s pathetic. Hope you had a blast though.
The DNC scientists and doctors are working on making a Biden clone as we speak.
Biden will accept the Democratic nomination from his basement.
Yet it's employees are union members who are backing Joe Biden.

Joe Biden = Science?
If Trump claims Obama and Biden are traitors, what's to stop me from saying the same thing about Trump.  Trump is a traitor. Won't ever take that back either.
Do you want the United state destruction? That's what you will get if Biden is our president. We need a strong leader like President Trump. He'll make America great again. He'll make it greater than you thought possible. He did it once and he'll do again.
Aaaaand now the phone bank and “coalition” lines. Jesus Christ you people are bitter absolute losers and rehash the same lines over and over. Cry about it more. And cry more when Biden wins. And cry even more when the legislation starts coming. Maybe go focus on your Patreon?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Joe Biden might have forgotten this, but many jobs do require you to take a test to see if you are on cocaine.   He appears to be slipping and, if elected, it will get worse over the course of his presidency. He’ll probably resign, leaving his VP and Pelosi as her VP.

I’ve read Biden’s response THREE times and I still can’t figure out what he was trying to say   What is the DNC up to this time.
Bernie was the compromise. Biden offers nothing to progressives.
Trump and Biden are not the same. Voting third party only helps trump stay in office. Trump wants to hurt immigrants and minorities. Don’t help trump. I wanted Bernie. Joe Biden has big flaws. But Dreamers, children, minorities, NEED joe Biden to win. (Love ya stixil! No h8)
This has to Biden’s wife’s burner account. Literally laughed out loud.
The problem though is this time the greater of two evils might actually destroy democracy as we know it. So I think we should do everything in our power to get rid of trump. At least Biden, as not ideal as he is, would keep us running as a nation and give us a chance for a future
If Biden does debate President Trump, it will be interesting to count how many “come on man”s there are in his incoherent responses.
Do you own a home? Do you plan on owning a home in the future? Biden’s plan would tax every homeowner 3% based on the value of the home. A $300,000 home would cost you an extra $9,000 a yr. Renters won’t go unscathed, their rent will double or triple in some places. Going...

So the trump administration is now supporting Biden? We already knew that from the Axios interview.
Only a few hundred are expected to be at the Democratic National Convention where former Vice President Joe Biden will formally accept the nomination.
1. Ignore the polls. They're not accurate (think 2016). Work like Biden is 10pts behind.  2. No, we have to learn from the mistakes that got Trump elected. Otherwise, we risk another disaster like him getting elected in the future.

Or, you can use Twitter to twist the liberal media into a knot.     Trump's brand is established. The majority of Americans are satisfied with a non-politician (forget Monmouth, CNN and Post skewed polls). Biden is a 47-year politician, washed up and cliche. Joe Kennedy III 2024!

This is what I see when I watch a Trump press briefing... #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #Biden46 #Biden #Biden2020 #NextSundayAD
Obama picked Biden because he was white and an establishment Democratic with foreign policy experience that some said Obama lacked. It was between Biden and Evan Bayh.
Even a goat would win against Donny tbh, The People has had enough of him.  I'm a Bernie Bro but I will still vote for Biden over the Divider-in-Chief.
I see it too Dinesh, i don't see how anyone can't see that there is a game being played here with Biden as the candidate.
Duhhhh   Don’t even go there,  the one you support is like AI but minus the I, not all that intelligent. He sure sleeps a lot though.  His arms don’t move when he walks. Try it yourself.Seriously.  Joe Biden might be bot.  IDK
Ummm “we don’t have the luxury”..? You mean us working class don’t, you haven’t been hurt by this presidency, not economically anyways. Biden sucks

God bless the free market not forcing anyone to go Mr. Biden Warrior.  Being a Biden Warrior do you go around telling black conservatives they’re not black if they don’t vote for Biden?
Maybe! I'm not saying she's my pick. Just watch out. Biden hasn't actually hinted anyone. Everyone else is guessing.
Like we're going to take advice from a wh*re. 😂 JOE BIDEN COULDN'T WRITE DOWN A GROCERY LIST MUCH LESS ANYTHING ELSE.  Campaign slogan for JOE AND KAMALA IS  SNIFF &amp; SUCK 😂😂😂
I’m curious to know what the process is if Biden drops out at the last minute, or if he is ruled unfit. Who runs in his place?
Yes. Pay attention for more security state propaganda in support of Joe Biden come August.

FIRST presidential debate Western Reserve/Cleveland  September 29-Tue  Vice presidential debate University of Utah October 7-Wed  SECOND presidential debate in Miami October 15-Thu  THIRD presidential debate in Nashville October 22-Thu  NOVEMBER 3, 2020 - 🇺🇸JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT
When you understand why Trump doesn’t want to debate  you’ll also understand why Biden doesn’t want to debate Trump. There is no difference.
me: idk if TikTok should be like 100% banned, I mean idc abou...  “ALL LIVES MATTER! Mask are communism! Biden is an old senile creep! Libtard!”
Do you know of some secret other candidates? It is Trump or Biden? Why do you want Biden to win? Do you think he is the better choice?
Are you planning on keeping your home or apartment under the Biden tax plan? 3% on all homeowners, $300,000 home will cost you $9,000. Renters? They’ll see their costs double and triple in some places. 401K? He’s planning on taxing that too. Good luck to you, door mat.
Joe Biden's handlers know he will lose the election if the country sees him try to think and speak on his feet as would be the case if he debates Donald Trump. Biden will have questions days in advance from the media and a speaker in his ear, but he has no chance if he debates.
My dad was recently diagnosed with dementia. He’s a little over a yr older than Biden. The squinting that Biden does, has nothing to do with stuttering it has everything to do with his sick brain. Biden should be no where near the White House, he needs to be in a retirement home.
Biden doesn’t want people to know about his tax plan. 3% on every home across America. If your home is worth $300,000 that’s $9,000. Renters won’t go unscathed, their rent will double or triple in some places.
Like Joe Biden’s plans do tax us into the poor class? Joe Biden’s tax plan would tax every homeowner 3%. If your home is worth $300,000 that’s $9,000 a yr. Now double the electric bill and natural gas bill. What will his voters give up? What am I/us going to have to give up?
Under the radar thought here, but what about Tulsi Gabbard for Biden's VP pick? Thoughts?
Yea I mean why wash my clothes if they’re just gonna get dirty again?  Also, attacking Biden on mental health doesn’t help your argument to not vote against Trump, and it makes you look like a callous asshole.
And the ads about Biden are so true and funny.
Biden doesn’t want to debate trump huh?  I wonder why?  🤔🙄
And why would any Biden supporters be anywhere near you?  They probably have better things to do, like a dentist appointment or the DMV.
I think the votes for Biden will be so overwhelming that by midnight there won't be any denying his victory.  How the Media Could Get the Election Story Wrong
Paying your electric bill will be unattainable under Biden’s plans. Double what you pay now. What will you have to give up in order to have electricity? Your cell phone, internet, home maintenance, car insurance, health insurance, or will you pick up 2 more jobs?
Bernie ran as a D, Biden is going to get that nomination. Bernie could easily petition and run as a 3rd party candidate, but he's not. Kanye missed the deadline on a bunch of states, but there's a handful that don't require a petition that he's attempting to get on this week...
You didn’t answer my question. How is Joe Biden taxing my home to the tune of $9000 helping me? How is Joe Biden taxing my 401K out of extistance, helping me? It’s not, stop playing games with an incompetent senile old man.
I supported, donated and voted for Bernie in both 2016 and throughout his campaign this last year.   Pointing out a fascist isn’t a threat to you. It’s not antagonizing you. It’s not rude.   But deciding Trump isn’t worth voting against because Biden isn’t great is priviliaged.
biden announce ur running mate challenge
Mr. Biden,  when you become president please do not spend too much time speaking about DT.  Thanks.
Right on schedule. Biden will never debate and media will cover him
of the PEOPLE, by the PEOPLE, for the PEOPLE.
Biden’s facial expressions vs trumps facial expressions.
They’re not democrats, they’re  Marxist, sucking the life out of everyone. They really need to stop referring to themselves as democrats. Biden’s plan to tax everyone who owns a home 3% of the value of your home, making sure homeownership is unattainable. A 300,000 home...
Biden is such a lying fraud it's painful
LOL, use President Trump's refusal to release his Income Tax Returns (which is not required to run for President)  as an excuse not to debate, because everyone knows Biden can't put two coherent sentences together. #KAG2020
So I guess none of you have ever misspelled anything while texting? But Biden thinks Arizona is a city. Pathetic. Such hypocrisy.

Lol of course they would weasel out of it, they know what will happen if the debates were to happen biden would be toast. Trump mops the floor with sleepy joe.

Do you remember how the Obama Democrats rolled over on every opportunity to guarantee abortion rights and other fundamental gains of the 20th century? Do you remember how they punted Supreme Court seats to Donald Trump? Do you envision a Biden presidency being different?
Do you not recall the massive stock gains and overall growth of the 1% under Barack Obama? Do you not think Joe Biden represents a continuation of that? Do you not think the mainstream Democratic party stands for the status quo in that sense?
The "fighting over people dying" is exactly what will continue to happen under the "no human right to healthcare" future endorsed by Joe Biden and his predecessor
What's worse is that Biden *will* win, if only because Trump doesn't have the energy or GOP backing to dispute the election, but shit won't really change. See also the Obama administration
The whole thing with Biden's condition concerns me a lot, why is he the candidate? Something isn't right.
Obama was the WORST President ever. Now he’s try to help get his Vice President elected. Eight years of him was seven years too many. Poor Joe Biden can’t string three words together that make sense,he has to have help walking. Obama needs to shut up and sit down. Enough Obama.
Bret you should try to be a little more fair and balanced or we will end up with a socialist country and a Blithering Idiot  in charge. I don’t need you to try to sway me to joe Biden. Democrats want socialism and I like Freedom. Don’t need your opinions

Joe Biden hates governments not aligned to US interests or under US influence. Their democratic failings and human rights records are merely used to justify US economic warfare to punish them for being independent of US control. Friendly dictatorships aren't similarly sanctioned.

I’m also slamming KHive for backing Biden after they wore tee shirts calling him a Segregationist. I’ll also slam KHive after Biden keeps his ticket white.
I heard you talking about your October 1 plan last week and because I’m a scientist (good, I hope all fools think I am “elitist”), I love your plan and me and mine are ready to do our part. If we keep pussyfooting around, we’ll be stuck at home until Biden’s inaugural!!
I will be voting, for Biden. Good luck in November! Honestly, I wish you the best of luck in an HONEST, straight forward election. The Constitution is pretty rock solid on how all this "Election" stuff works out. Have you looked into a youtube job after your "Daddy" is gone?
They will not let Joe debate. And they will blame Trump to boot. This is how it’s done. Biden can only lose a debate with Trump and his handlers know that.
Kamala was merely acting the night she called out Biden over busing so Biden’s camp doesn’t trust her. I don’t think it’s absurd at all but hey I dislike both of them.
Everyone can see that you are already trying to cheat everyway possible. If the election is rigged, it will result in a win for you. Biden does not need a “rigged” election to bear your sorry ass
Biden...you’re untrustworthy!!
This is how you take your own accurate poll:  FACEBOOK: Trump 28.5 Million likes. Biden 2.2 Million likes.
The Bernie Bros failed to show up and after lagging behind in hundreds of delegates and no reason to risk his supporters getting COVID19 he quit and endorsed Biden... like he said he would do multiple times. Now Bernie Bros want to be mad that Bernie has no move to make.
Hell the fuck yes I will, BUT it is far more likely that trump will refuse (find an excuse) to debate Biden. Because Biden is accomplished, politically experienced, compassionate and well read, all things Trump isn’t, he will be afraid to take Biden on! Watch for DJT excuses!
VP Biden will have such a deep bench of expertise for his cabinet and more. Heaven knows we'll need great leadership at all levels, including VP. We know he'll give more power and respect to that office as well.
Joe Biden is so close to a VP pick he can smell her.
It wouldn’t even be a debate. It would be a highlight reel if Biden forgetting where he is and trump rambling about China.
All you have to do to shut KHive up is tell them to donate some money and they’ll vanish. No one this like Kamala. When she asked for money they pretended to be deaf and when she called Biden a Segregationist they backed him.
You have more than two options. 🤷‍♂️ So you will choose a sexual predator because deep down you don’t think there’s anything wrong with sexual predation. Your assertion that “I don’t believe” is disingenuous at best with dozens of obvious photo examples of Biden creeping girls.
If Biden becomes POTUS, he will be a puppet played by the socialists from Schumer, Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler. AOC to the Squad.  His mental condition has deteriorated to a point where he can’t control or defend himself.  He will be totally vernable to the socialists around him.

You can't find a Biden vote in Scranton either. If your story started in Scranton it ends in your basement.
There is some concern growing that Biden has coluded with Xi in China to create the COVID-19 pendemic to aid in the removal of Trump from office.  Biden is no stranger to China since he aided his son in getting billions paid by China to Hunter Biden.  These actions were criminal.

Biden has never even spoken to AOC. 😂 You don't know what you're talking about. Biden sucks, but you're the one spouting off Fox News buzzwords. The Fed is doing what Trump wants. If the economy's good, it's Trump. If the economy is bad, it's the Fed and Biden. T-Bone is wild.
So Joe Biden supports Medicare For All? That's new to me. You are breaking news, T-Bobile.
Isn’t he Biden’s good friend?  No bias there!

What is your strategy here? Everytime you try to accuse VP Biden of memory issues, it just reminds me, it's your dad who has done all these...
Give me a break.  Months ago VP Biden said he would make his announcement in August.  Do you research before you write?
William Barr's reputation is on the line here, if he was thinking about keeping Obama and Biden out of the investigation he needs to rethink that now, Democrats don't hold back it's time we didn't either, William Barr needs to bring the hammer down bring back Justice

It makes my stomach turn that the people running Joe Biden's campaign didn't capitalise on this as a campaign slogan/strategy.   Maybe they really are socialists 🥴

He asked Ukraine to look into the removal of a prosecutor. (Which Biden bribed them to remove which has been confirmed by audio tape and the Ukrainian government.) I’ll provide a link if you’d like.  So is bribing and etc is bad?  But this proves the hypocrisy I was mentioning.

I can't imagine anyone more toxic to the American way of life than Kamala Harris as President. And that's what you'll get, if she's the VP pick, and Biden wins.
Yeah, Obama definitely wasn't far left and was more pragmatic, which is probably why I liked him. Hopefully, Biden won't feel he owes the soccer moms much.

Yep, Biden/Harris ticket.
Joe Biden doesn't know he is Joe Biden.
You don’t need to vote to elect Biden.  Just hold protests and riots.
I think Kamala is a good pick but from that tweet earlier there seems to be some that think IF she isn’t picked then screw Biden. F those people.
Are you sure of that number? How many died with covid and not because of covid? Elect Joe Biden and it goes away? Yea.. ok... good little Marxist, the CCP, wil raise your social credit score by 5.
Whoever he picks,  will be the next president if Biden is elected,  he won't make it through one term.     This farce is so transparent,  even non political junkees like me can see through it.
Biden lacks the cognitave capacity to participate in a debate.
Biden can't debate him.  Trump will make him look incompetent. Biden can't critically think anymore (not a dig, but he is clearly in cognitive decline).
Case in point. They have no trouble deciphering what Trump says....THENNNNN right after tweet something that Biden NEVER said.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week   ...could Mike Obama be the dark horse candidate...

Man...F those people. Calling you a Karen when it’s THEM acting like some entitled douchecanoes over a simple question. Those people I find almost as bad as Trumpers. Almost.
So I have been reading the tweets &amp; what I get is that you are living in a paradox. You are okay with Biden ONLY if KH is picked as VP? Anyone who questions this all of a sudden is no ally? The F...maybe you should join the Trumpers with that logic.
If Biden did pick Kamala for his running mate, one upshot is that she would definitely put all the convicts back in prison.

I wonder how she feels about not being considered for VP on the basis of her race.  She’s not black so Biden won’t consider her on her merits.  I’d like to hear her honest opinion of that.

As well as being sexually attracted to children, Joe Biden had to drop out of his presidential campaign in 1987 because he was caught plagiarizing speeches.

I understand that Trump wants a white American but again allowing Biden to run for office and win does nothing but uplift pedofiles. Biden Clearly has dementia and I’m sure he could us that as an excuse to justify his actions.
It sure seems like the Biden supporters are more defined by the opposition to Biden than their actual arguments FOR Biden? There just is zero "here's why he's great/a great choice". Only "He's not Trump" and "sOrRy He'S nOt GoNnA fIx EvErYtHiNg, LeFtIsTs"
Biden is the most moderate candidate I've ever seen...
Biden would take away those rights, and do whatever is party wanted. Because none of them approve of the constitution. We are in uncharted waters right now. Trump is trying to protect the innocent in Portland. And went in as a last resort. Not the first reaction.
Karter, the difference between Biden and Trump, is Trump abides by the constitution. Which says the state has the responsibility to manage their own issues.  They can request federal aid, but the government is not supposed to go in unrequested.

is the racist his own actions and friends prove that. Friends with people like Robert Byrd and Strom Thrumond he also uses racial slurs. Biden also has been accused of rape. Since you support Biden you must support his racism and assault on women.
Biden is played between Clinton and Republicans. That’s a laugh.
Nice piece by  this morning. Offer big change that feels familiar. Avoid ideological traps and be ruthlessly pragmatic. Hope  and his team give it a read.
Remember that a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Don’t feed the fire, vote for
Biden is not a progressive. This isn't a debate.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Can’t Delay Voting, but He Can Cause Confusion" by Unknown Author via NYT
Biden is a fucking conservative. He isn't the left. Eww
Facts: he is our President, he isn’t cheering he is stating truths that media won’t, he banned travel from China early on &amp; Biden called him xenophobic, Biden later admits this was right thing to do, covid is less deadly than flu so doesn’t really matter
He can’t even remember what he is running for. Biden is a puppet for the rich liberals.
Y’all still voting for Biden??
Biden is a pedo as well why tf are we voting
Sense? This man changes his mind, more than he washes his hands. He makes as much sense as Biden-none. He’s been wrong about everything. Picture from the 80’s. HIV era, Mr Fauci, “get over it.” Fuk that leprechaun.
It's not paranoia to believe Trump is going to sue to get the results overturned and a hold put on swearing in Biden while it works it's way up to the SC where they will declare the results null and void.
This isn’t going the way you thought it was. This is projection of your own personal beliefs, not what has been witnessed on camera with Biden and his wandering hands, on women and children. He’s sick and so are you.HAVE YOU EVEN TRIED TO DO ANY JOURNALISM?  HAVE YOU EVEN ASKED FAULSI FOR A LIE TO COVER UP OR GO BACK ON HIS SPEECH?  YOU GIVE BIDEN A DO OVER TO LIE HIS WAY OUT OF EVERYTHING HE SAYS.  COME ON DO WORK.
Yes an I watched MSNBC last night the polls show Hispanics having problems voting for Biden. Insanity. Frankly the people should be released and throw the Trump Administration in these camps awaiting trials for crimes against humanity.

Biden only has a basement.  Dont be sad The White house has a bunker.  Its for the President who is VIP to our Nation. Dummy.
and the Dem(wit) party including Obamagate have been lying this entire year.  The funniest to me is that Trump is a racist.  So...  History hopefully wont lie but tell the truth about the lies like the fake impeachment of no facts or actual witnesses.  Yes Biden is an idiot.
I couldn’t give a rats behind how he pronounces it at least he knows WHAT to say unlike ummm (let’s say it together, class) Biden?!!😂🤣😂
Indeed! And after another 4 years for him, it will make Biden to old to try this run again. Tells you how bad Dems have it if he is there best foot forward! Peace.
Trumps running for Office, Biden is running scared to his basement.
Is it just me or does Biden’s side of the house constantly have to explain what he said? I don’t see Trump do it even 1/20 of what Biden and his handlers have to do-that my opinion and I’m sticking to it! Peace.

Never Biden is essentially saying trump 4Eva. We have to restore the center before we can move to the left. All or nothing gets nothing when you are too far out to convince the center.
Ha. Biden is probably really scared of covid or black people.  Its a jungle out there man and he decided to stay home and shave his legs.
Trumps getting desperate. Biden a Catholic all his life.  Against guns. Must feel desperate about the NRA.
Trump must be getting scared. Biden's a Catholic
Isn't Biden an actual practicing Catholic? What religion does Trump actually belong too. As an agnostic, religion should not be in politics.
You blacks are common as hell and suoer ignorant, to Joe Biden. Take look.
They're preparing to be concerned about the budget when Biden becomes President😏😏😏
Tampering with the mail is a felony. Hope Biden wins &amp; throws this Trump Stooge running USPS in the slammer &amp; that goes for anyone at USPS that stops the flow of mail. The excuse "I was order to block the flow" doesn't work the same excuse used at Nuremberg Trials
Biden drives Vets and the only thing I see Trump ever driving is a golf cart. Think about it.
Forget cancel Culture... Well. As long as your not pro Biden or Pro  Pro vaccine Pro Mask Pro abortion Pro anything not Trump.  Your golden.  Lmao
Good, now do it over the Photoshopped Biden pictures
He ran for office once and became U.S. PRESIDENT   WHO IS YOUR HERO?  50YEARS OF DO NOTHING BIDEN?  QUID PRO QUO  GUY?
If America isn't equal for all then how did Biden get to where he's at? That idiot has almost bullshitted his way all the way to the top.
Lmao. What is Trump doing to Justice?  And you idiot. Im Comanche not white why do I care about white people and powers to have or share?  Also you are a racist because many hispanic and blacks love Trump.  Biden said you aint black if you vote for Trump.   Racist dividers.
So he gained a few pounds.  Greatest President ever still!  Did more for Americw than Biden and the Dinosaurs in Congress.
Lori, its the Postal Unions that have endorsed biden. Im sure all the Postal unions have endorsed him. The Postal service has 5 or 6 unions for such a large corporation there is NO UNITY amongst employees..
Who asked for a diaper change? Id believe Biden did.  Complain about ratings.  He said he was upset that falsie is rated higher but people hate Trump.  Which he was right about. They hate trump for no reason.  But he is up in Numbers breaking records MAGA Trump 2020 baybee!!
You mean Biden. And no he isnt there but he is still in his basement.
Joe Biden thinks Blacks are Junkies.  Since the man interviewing him is not a Biden supporter, the man is not black so he cannot be a junkie...   BASIC LOGIC.  HAHAH OMG  DUMB!
You know if my choices for President are Biden, Trump or Kanye, Kanye doesn't seem that bad.
Drop that VP pick already, Biden
That was not  And no, it was not dead. It was building SLS and helping get astronauts to the space station thanks to the support of Obama/Biden
I guess it’s a matter of opinion. It will take Biden 10 mintes to remember her name then STILL have to read his own notes. I think it’s Obama’s end game to get back in the WH. Peace.
Michigans new low income facility burned to ground. This is what OUT OF TOWNERS or local paid Craig’s list $25.00 hour. Joe Biden company helping with bail payments! Jail for rest of life breaking rocks, we’ll never have to hear from them again and some will squeal like pigs!
Let me add, Trump is also not the classiest person, but again McCain has a very shady history in some of the stuff he did.  I wouldn’t knock anyone that has passed but Trump is a thin skinned individual.  Having said all of that, he’s still better than Hillary and Biden.
I think we NEED the debates now more than ever to shine a light on the differences between Trump and Biden. Then Biden can sit down somewhere.
Watching this I noticed a beautiful girl in Green behind Biden and was like HELLO. HOW DID I NOT NOTICE HER BEFORE?  WAIT?  WHAT WAS THE QUESTION?  WHY WAS I WATCHING THAT?  WHATEVER.
So absurd.  There is a virus world wide with a 99% survival and recovery rate.  But Dem(Wits) somehow believe Trump is responsible?  You should be ashamed for using a virus as a political lie to cause chaos.  Republicans want to open America.  Biden been failling for 50+ yrs.
You're assuming that the fix isn't already in with biden
I haven't seen any evidence that taxpayer money went to Hunter Biden for his position with the Ukrainian energy company, but I do know that it is well documented that the rooms at places like Mar-a-Lago are paid for by taxpayers and are not free, at least not for secret service.
maybe if your network would actually covers Biden's press briefings and interviews.
Joe Biden can too. Then again compare to Stitt, Inhofe, and Cole a bar-s hotdog would be better. 🙀🙀😹😹
Biden is a proven racist
#RyanAFournier I Know Right! B. OBAMA Was SPEWING PROPAGANDA for 11-/2hrs AS HIS eulogy! WTF? WOW BIDEN'S SO DESPERATE! "*DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS*" + THE FORMER PRESIDENT ie; THE "FORMER"! BIDEN Cannot Speak if it's Not Written Down.I Sincerely PRAY he's Not Displaying dementia.

History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
Lead on Mr. President...and apologize for attacking Biden’s faith, you erred.  Your big enough to admit it.
Keep to the issues and no disparaging remarks about Biden’s faith.
I don't care who Biden picks.  I'm still voting for him.
But trump "did" say, "Biden doesn't deserve the black vote..." because of his gaffe.  I would express that the media didn't say that, trump did.... ijs
ha ha ha!  We're NOT talking about African immigrants! LOL     Nonetheless, Kenyans are different than Nigerians as they are different from Ugandans - which is the point Biden was making;  there is no monolithic ideology among a specific race;  the diversity is what matters!
You know nothing about Catholic Faith. Biden is a heretic. Abortion infanticide same sex marriage socialism. Contraception. You are an ignorant idiot. A mortal sin for  a Catholic to vote Biden
Biden will probably just keep his cool and not get into an argument with trump because will turn it against Biden if he doesn't say every word perfectly when even trump can't do it but that's okay with trump cuz he's president
Notice I said “One dumb thing” and not incredibly racist thing every time he speaks once a month. I wish Trump wasn’t the better choice here but if you think Biden has what it takes you are either willing to risk our entire country to get trump out or you are blindto what you see
And if Biden says something racist every time he speaks that is an issue. Democrats go through Trumps many speeches and tries to find one dumb thing he says and light it on fire and then pour gasoline on it while most normal stable individuals is watching dems do this like “WTF?”
Yeah that’s what I was saying about taking everything he says at face value. I agree that’s a ridiculous thing to say that he has done more for Black people than Lincoln but thinking highly of ones self is a whole lot different then the shit Biden says.
There is only one African American culture and country? I can think of a few different ones. And if Democrats are going to take everything Trump says at face value then people with a brain are inclined to take everything that Biden says at face value.
Biden talks a good fight but never delivers.  His inactions are hard to understand until he talks and says what he really thinks.  Conclusion:  he lies a lot—Another BS Democrat!!
Biden is too demented &amp; delusional to recognize the implications of announcing “black woman”  as a prerequisite for the VP position.
Biden thinks Jobs was The Apple Computer guy!!
I see Biden has found his VP for 2020...LMBO
It will need to be a long add.  Or Can just make several and just rerun them over and over.  That way many will think all Biden does is make goofy assertions and his racist attitudes will become vote changers.
If you're riding Biden--you're on the highway to hell.
Biden is a good man but that would be a stupid move at this point. Trump wouldn't do it for him or anyone else and Trump deserves not to get away with everything he's done
Mr. President, respect VP Biden’s beliefs in God.  We all differ a little.  Respect that.
Ummmmm...... That's exactly what Biden was talking about.  (You did watch the video right) ijs

Whatever Hiding Biden. Go back to playing with your dolls in your basement gePEDO!
It’s funny because Trump is def not a believer in any faith and Biden is a practicing catholic
Because we don't need debates for this election. We know to vote for Biden and to throw you out. Easiest decision ever.
I dare  to have a "debate" abt the Bible! Biden would wipe trump out on a debate abt it &amp; only thing trump would be able to do is mutter "ppl are saying","ppl have told me", "I hear there's some guy in it who does some pretty good things, but, eh, I can't relate"!

Biden said he would ask a woman to be his VP.
I’m not saying this to argue, but people voting for Joe need to fully evaluate his VP pick first. If Joe wins, “she” will be your president within a year. Joe won’t be capable. To most Biden voters, this doesn’t matter. Whatever it takes to get Teump out is their thinking.
If Biden’s campaign folks don’t get him on TikTok doing a goofy dance in the next 24 hours are they even paying attention?
Hello - can the right finally say they don't know what in the hell he's talking about because Obama and Biden didn't run in 2016?
AND this wasn't about the funeral it was about 4 years ago - where Obama stayed way out of the Campaign as did Biden. l
It wasn't a campaign speech and he never mentioned Trump. Funny that he never mentioned Trump but everyone on both sides knew exactly what he was talking about. And it was about the chaos in current leadership - and he's thrown his support to Biden, he's allowed to support Biden.
How is it possible that Biden is leading Trump in the polls in Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, etc... with his energy policies? His policies would kill millions of jobs and bankrupt the states. #DontBelieveThePolls
Obama wasn't running 4 yrs. ago u incompetent, imbecile, Putin loving TRAITOR! &amp; Guess what--he's not running again this yr.! But Joe Biden is &amp; he will win by a landslide b/c ppl have had 4 yrs. of ur vile, racist presidency &amp; that's too much! #NobodyLikesTrump

Then Congress gains a few more members like Bernie the next few years. Then we get a slightly better Biden after that. This change allows Republicans and centrist Democrats to adjust and not raise to in arms like GOP did with Obama. Unfortunately you can't slide into a black prez
Yeah, its how human history has worked for centuries. The problem is that the American ideal is to demand instant gratification. To compare to other topic, we don't want slightly better Trump, we want Bernie. But politics has never worked like that. So hopefully we get Biden.
Your have said worse and still on the hunt. I don’t give a fuck what Biden does. You gonna go. Then go to jail
Yeah SCOTUS seats are the only thing keeping this relevant for me. But at the same time, Biden is likely to pick a moderate person to take RBG seat, who honestly should’ve retired in 2008 but I guess we will say

Oh my bad I thought you thought ignoring millions of voters was the conspiracy. (That is obviously a given) The DNC isn't going to switch out Biden. His VP is going to be the president when he steps down. So no bait and switch like you suggest.

Joe Biden is literally the stick bike meme personified.
Joe Biden is both articulate &amp; reads well. He does flub words and panics, probably from his early stutter.  Trump’s reading skills are abysmal. I doubt he even knows that word. When he speaks, he often doesn’t form complete sentences &amp; is difficult to follow.  It’s word vomit.
Take it back lord knows biden cant
Anything is better than comparing that to a regime that caused so many deaths and pain for survivors.  The brutality cannot be compared to anything. I would never compare Biden or anybody to something like that.

It almost seems like there are those on the left who would go to the ends of the earth to tear Biden down enough to make him lose. And for what? So they can say "I told you so!"?
I agree, But I feel like if Biden is polling around 36% I think it can be close.
So should Obama stork biden clintons clapper comey vindman yates antifa cuomos de blasio pelosi shiff nadler
Would anybody even be surprise it Biden wins OK and Cleveland counties?
I bet Biden can say Yosemite correctly. Also, Thailand instead of Thighland!😂
#KIngTrump worships money, power, and fame oh but wait... He tells a crowd that “Joe Biden is against God”. Wow really ?
No one else could beat trump. So if Biden wins he was the best candidate. This country is still very racist.
Before we let Joe Biden retract (again), why did he EVER CHOOSE THE WORD "UNLIKE"..BEFORE SAYING "AFRICAN-AMERICANS"?  SOMETHING IN HIS BRAIN TRIGGERED THAT WORD.
Biden is a disaster. Even a coward ghoul like Sen. Cruz can clown him. A political party that had any credibility or decency would not only cancel  candidacy, but expel him from from their party. The  won't, and that's really all you need to know about their worth.
If you were wondering why Biden shot down M4A, follow the money trail of his donors.
I never said that Trump is a Christian. I also didn't say that Biden isn't. I look at their policy choices and see whether they support Christian values or not and place my vote accordingly.
When identity politics goes wrong. Joe Biden trying to hang on to the Latino and Black vote after today’s interview. #Trump2020 🇺🇸
So teens reserved free tickets to his kk_ meeting/ campaign rally. tRump has a toddler fit taking away income from our youth. Yep, every teen eligible to vote this year vote for Biden. He isn't a perpetual child.
I'll wait for the  and  morning digests to figure out what the #Biden hashtag was about. I clicked on it but 90% of the tweets were trumpet talking heads. They can't write proper English. Then there's Biden apologizing for something I don't have a clue about.
Nice try at redirecting the conversation back to Trump. That tactic doesn't work with me. You sit in judgement of him for breaking the Ten Commandments while breaking them yourself. Do you think Biden hasn't? Who says it's okay to break 1, 2, or 3 but not all? You?
Biden obviously didn’t write this. Keep the Segregationist in his basement.
I can’t imagine wearing a Lil’ Kamala tee shirt &amp; jumping on the Segregationist bandwagon like KHive. Maybe it’s because Biden had corporate money and didn’t need to ask them for donations that was so appealing. Still doesn’t explain why they are so obsessively angry with Bernie
West himself has hinted he may be in the race to detract from Biden. When it was brought up West responded, “I’m not denying it."
⁦ said in 1977 that desegregation would create 'a racial jungle' - Business Insider #JoeBidenIsARacist
Uuuhhhh...Biden is funded by China, so? Isn’t this a tad bit hypocritical?
hey Rick, c'mon man, I don't want my children to grow up in a jungle,  a racial jungle.    Also Joe Biden: C'mon man you got anymore of those Coleman coolers,  you know the thing with that Confederate flag?
⁦ Problematic Record On Racial Justice, #JoeBidenIsRacist
Joe seems to always just be making a “mistake” when it comes to his racist asshole mouth.   It’s been documented since he’s been In politics 100 years. Just go back and listen. You can see the conviction in his face when he says the crap he says.
Imagine how much the evangelical voters would freak out if Obama said Biden could hurt God.
Tell me you did not just call joe biden woke
we were all told last week that THIS WEEK Biden wld announce his VP running mate. That WAS last week, right? Its Thursday August 6th.  So, what’s got the left in a tizzy y’all? They’re mad about something aren’t they? They’re Acting like it. Smh
I’ll prob vote for Biden depending on his VP because that is who will be president.  Have fun reading peoples minds.
Yes.  I don't want Biden. I never wanted Biden. I think it's utterly asinine that he got the nom over Warren.  But.  He's what we've got. He MUST beat Trump.  SO HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS GOB SHUT, PICK HIS VP (K. H.), AND LET HER DO THE TALKING 'cause she'll be better at it.
I THINK BIDEN CHOOSING A VP ONLY BY SEX OR RACE IS THE HIGHEST FORM OF RACISM AND SEXISM!
Can we please get #JoJorgensen2020 trending on Twitter? Biden isn’t a good choice, Trump damn sure isn’t. #JoNotJoe is our only hope!  predicted a woman president after Trump anyways.  #TrendingHashtags #JoJo2020 #VoteGold #VoterSuppression
Heck Biden won’t even do one!!! Watch and see.
is saying that all black people are the same, think the same,  come from the same, singular place.  C'MON MAN. In 2016 trump didn't pander to black Americans for their vote.   He asked for it for the same reason he asked for my vote. Cont.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
White Oklahoman here.  Only freaking state where Trump carried all (77)counties in 2016.  I am literally surrounded by tighty whiteys.  I’m Ridin’ with Biden.  #VoteBlue
Glad to see how serious some people take their right to vote. Biden can't get through an answer, intelligently. His (Or his puppeteer's) choice will be the President, if he's elected. No way he's capable of making it 4 years.
Earned my follow and I couldn’t agree more.  I’m ridin’ with Biden and HosrseWhisper.  The good guys are in blue.  Trump is all hat, no cattle.
impressed the hell out of me on the  again. This guy's standing up to big money and exposing fact that the Biden camp wants large dark money in politics. Points out that we don't only have two choices... #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Call me silly, but IF Biden (who if I recall is a Catholic) were to try to “hurt God,” my money’s on God.
Perhaps, but never Trump is ignorant...trusting our country in Biden’s socialist hands is essentially never-Republican.
I'll give it 10 minutes before a Trump quote emerges.  I'll give it 10 weeks before anyone sees Biden in a public place.
Biden rivals Hillary for military strategy ineptness.
Better to be pissed off than pissed on, my guy. Speaking of, were you as up in arms about R. Kelly’s verifiable crimes as you are about Biden’s alleged ones? Or is this whole thing really about the Qreepy Qult you’re in?
God damn Joe Biden sounds awesome
If you refuse to vote, I don’t wanna hear shit from you about trump for the next 4 years.   He’s gonna win because of idiots like you. AND IM NOT SAYING BIDEN IS A GOOD OPTION EITHER, but he isn’t Donald Trump. Grow up and quit acting like someone else is gonna fix this and VOTE.
Is it just me or is anyone else here in the U.S. tired of seeing political posts about Trump and Biden? November can't get here fast enough...
Biden can even read a teleprompter what makes u think he can read a bible
And more of Biden being racist af.
can someone photoshop biden’s face into this?
You misspelled Joe Biden
God is kinda weak if Biden can hurt him.  I don't think Biden could hurt me.
Joe Biden needs to be interviewed a lot more.
There's your man, church. His profound knowledge and intimate relationship with God says that Biden will hurt God and the Bible. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
He is using our tax payer money to fly across the country for Biden hate speeches
So, are the schools going provide the masks, and make sure the younger kids keep them on for 5 or 6 hours even when they have sneezed or coughed in them.  This only makes sense to somebody like “ come on man” Biden !
Well I’m not voting for tRump so that counts as a vote for Biden considering Democrats’ logic.
Btw the way Biden just said the African American community isn’t diverse. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
And I’m taking Biden’s advice and casting my vote For The Other Biden
I’m not voting for Biden.... So....
I've become so inured to bad news and doomscrolling that when I actually get good news I have a panic attack.   I expect to have a complete meltdown if Biden actually gets elected. Which is ok, in the end.
Yeah, like how every other author “hurt” their imaginary characters. Biden is literate.
Twitter will ban  &amp; the campaign before too long. The #Biden left &amp; their evil media allies have declared total war, just like Goebbels did. No limits. We'll see some startling new outrages before November.   **Threats of secession from west coast feces states.
You see, I am voting for Joseph Robinette Biden on November 3rd, *specifically* because he will hurt god, and hurt god very hard
WTF is Biden talking about? Mannnnn we gotta keep praying yo! Because if not we are in Barney Rubble... TROUBLE!!
Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
What’s he means when he says Biden is going to hurt God is that he’s trying to unseat him as president
I’m now treating the Biden-Trump Debate as a Heavy Weight Championship.  It’s going to be electric. The only way itll be better would is if Jo is there. #LetHerSpeak
You can't test the dead. He won't survive losing to Biden. It will literally kill him .
Well, I have never heard Biden take the Lord’s name in vain!
At a debate, Biden should do nothing but challenge trump to Bible trivia. What does John 3:16 say?  What was Joseph’s (Jesus’s dad’s) occupation? Who came before Jesus to prepare the way? What are the beatitudes? Etc.
What the hell is wrong with Biden... who could possibly vote for this fool?
Does that mean the Justice League will get Biden to help the next time Darkseid attacks Earth?
FWIW, I think this is some awkward wording from Biden but makes much more sense in context:
Yeah ok hmmm lets test your theory out shall we, one is out answering questions and holding confrence after confrence after confrence and one hides in his basement. Trump is not affraid of Biden, Biden is going to get embarrassed if the democrats even let old poor joe debate
Biden couldn't even read your tweet without screwing that up for 10 minutes before actually getting it right.
Biden is coming for you!
You are so destructive and such a liar. I cannot wait to have President Biden in office.
I know you can't comprehend this but, unlike you, Joe Biden will obey the Constitution including the Second Amendment. I know you think this is for suckers but it's what honest and ethical people do, even if it's against what they personally believe in.  Because it's the law.
Did not know #Biden was this all powerful. He's been keepin his God hurting powers on lock.
Share what you want, obvs, but maybe check someone’s bio and other tweets before sharing their stuff. Not sure why folks on the left would want to help conservatives hurt Biden with sketchy readings of small comments taken out of context.
Biden is specifically asked about TPS for Venezuelans vs Cubans being deported. He answers about TPS, and then mentions Latino diversity. Seems clear to me he’s talking about political (not ethnic) diversity, and some Latinos being more conservative on immigration (eg Cubans).
I see some conservative media creeps are sharing a short clip of Biden’s interview with NABJ/NAHJ to try to make him look bad. The full interview is here:  Relevant section is ~36 minutes, he’s asked about TPS for Latino immigrants from various countries.
Maybe except for Pete Buttigeig but yeah of the Dems at least Biden, Butti and Warren are deeply religious where Trump seems to believe in nothing except money/Mammon
Joe Biden disgusts me.
Only thing that would make me pause on Biden is if he chose Ivanka and that pause would be very short.
Vote your conscience and principles. Even if that's not Biden or Trump and one of those two wins (as is likely), the winner not having your vote (and those of similar mind) still lessens any perceived mandate and has the potential of altering the future political landscape.
To all the military folks in the State of Oklahoma if you vote for  for president you all must be okay with Putin paying bounties for the heads of your brothers and sisters overseas! I so hope not!! Vote Biden as he will stand up to Putin instead of being buttfuck
Lord , I need you to send down better candidates for preseident... biden is just....i was raised to respect my elders but people make it hard.
Love it when Trump campaigns for Biden
Biden=Practicing Catholic 45 impeached forever=can’t hold a bible correctly.😷😷😷

#Biden's cringe comments about "the blacks all being alike" remind me of the cartoonish white characters on "The Jeffersons," "Good Times," or "Sanford &amp; Son."  Our family watched and wept at the hurtful characterizations.  I'll take my #reparations for THOSE tv programs in gold.
Failing to understand why the car ad was Good, Actually, is why your entire movement and candidate fell flat on its face and you’re still spending your time each day Whining Online about it, while ignoring the entirety of Biden’s platform and the progressive input it’s received
They should have a debate BEFORE people vote because we to see if Biden is competent to be a president. Unless he needs to hide something. We shouldn't vote for any president because he's a nice guy, that doesn't cut it. We need a president to be ready to go on day one.

It’s really fkin weird that Trumps sexual allegations span 30 fking years but now all of a sudden it’s a non issue cause they point fingers at Biden. This picture of your kids is fkin stupid and it’s very telling....they don’t look even half Mexican. Mi esposa es Mexican..so yeah

I ain't worried. Trump's African American Kanye Kardashian will NOT stop Biden from winning
So with that statement you are a Christ follower?  So Joe Biden want I ng to give everyone everything on the backs of working people is what you want. I get up at 4:15 every day and bust my ass until 4:00 or after and then go home to 5 acres of work. My choice but it took me 30+
Bernie’s way of fighting back was his voters and we didn’t show up in the numbers he said we needed. Unless you’re claiming mass voter fraud that 300 delegate lead Biden had and no path to the nomination I see no reason why Bernie would keep fighting when the Bros weren’t.
Biden said he would veto M4A and compared his VP vetting process to a car. Biden also said to “Vote for The Other Biden”.
Fair enough.  Biden can be rather thick, but you're talking sense, here.  Thanks!
We aren't that dumb to vote for a man in the sunken place. He's a Kardashian. I don't believe Kanye will take votes from Biden. GOP thinks us blacks are ignorant and uneducated
“Make no mistake, Biden wasn’t chosen by popular acclaim. He was anointed by the Democratic Party’s new kingmaker, Barack Obama.”  Biden's mental ability a campaign issue that can't be ignored: Devine
Listen, I understand we don’t want that man having a second term. But Biden is just as trash, loves. Let’s just burn it
Yeah but that’s when all Democrats were against gay marriage. Remember when Tulsi was the first Democrat to endorse gay marriage? Tulsi beat Biden, Obama and Hillary.
Barr and Trump will bring the full weight of the U.S. government to steal the election.  James Comey Wrote a Letter in 2016. What Will Bill Barr Do?
I do not believe it was planned to show force.    As far as President Trumps faith is concerned that is between him and God. All I know is his agenda lines up with what I want for this country way more than Joe Biden or any of the other democratic leaders.
Biden couldn't find his ass with both hands let alone handle this pandenic.
Biden also took a shot at Trump's personal history with money. #YouGoJoe  via
The GOP exploiting a mentally ill black man to try and siphon off votes from Biden is both racist and stupid AF.
You need to investigate Joe Biden and his son. They have taken money from China and others foreign countries!
If the GOP congress candidate keeps running with "defend Trump" as campaign theme, the Biden lead in OK-5 will be even bigger.
Remember when Biden forgot what the declaration of independence was?
Trump is Stupid. Biden is in severe cognitive decline.
has no idea what he is even talking about! My grandkids can put sentences together better than Joe Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂 and they are 3 and 5!
Mannnn the whole strategy behind that is too siphon off votes frm Biden, Ye don’t have a snowballs chance in winning, but what he can do is take votes away frm Biden which in turn helps Trump
Biden socialist list. 1. Emply out the prisons. 2.single payer healthcare. 3.government paid child care. 4.the green new deal. 5.guaranteed basic income. 6.reparation.
Biden free pass from the media. Joe's society: less safe and less free kids and less adgacted.
🌟🌟Wouldn't it be the ultimate GIFT to America if millions of Biden voters mailed in their ballots early like Hillary requested, and then after the debates, the DNC was forced to replace presumptive nominee Joe Biden? 🌟🌟 🙏🙏🙏
Biden would use the pandemic to ram through far left polices.
Biden projected winner.
Susan Rice, Biden VP Finalist, Said Bowe Bergdahl Served ‘With Honor And Distinction’   ...we traded 5 GITMO terrorists for this deserter...fair trade?
I wish Joe Biden would show up on my private property and try himself to take my guns, he wont be leaving my property
Come get me when Biden's pro-Nazi and then we'll talk.
I'm hose, and this is good voter outreach for Biden.
Sure, will that be before or after Israel cash their DAILY $8.2 million check?  Mr. Biden to earn my vote you must acknowledge that our ‘allies’ are abusing the rights of my family in the #GazaStrip everyday. Not sure what caused the explosion, but how about all the others?
That’s such a clickbait headline “Overall, the poll found that 43 percent of voters would choose Biden in a present-day matchup whereas 40 would choose Trump.” - then they don’t provide actual information on white voters
Joe Biden is so demented that he actually thinks this is a winning platform? 🤔🤦🏼‍♀️
Because Biden is the biggest pandering politician there is. He walks back every single position he has ever stood by.
Virginia mayor urged to resign after allegedly saying Joe Biden picked ‘Aunt Jemima’ as his VPYes. Trump was mentioned by name is the case documents for Epstein’s trial and a child says he was one of the men to rape her on that island. Biden is not perfect. He’s not my first pick but I won’t vote for monsters.
Classic  spin! Barely mention what should be bombshell for Biden campaign, then spin it to attack how   responded to the gaff. Where are the hard hitting questions to  about his racist attitude that all blacks are the same? #NoJoe2020
I am White and attend an HBCU and I am voting for Biden! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
If Donald Trump asked a black journalist if he took a “cocaine test” it would be wall to wall coverage of him being racist.  But Joe Biden said it so he gets a pass.
Dude... I know people don’t like Trump and he’s said dumb things... but I really feel like Biden is just as bad.
Can someone explain to me why the Biden ad strategy is to seek support so that you can be one of the first to know his running mate? That announcement will be live on social media in 30 seconds when it’s made. I’m sincerely confused by this strategy.
I didn't say it was a good strategy. :-)  I think the Biden campaign would be well served staying out of the headlines for the most part. Let Trump dominate the news cycle with his... Trumpiness. Biden's been shooting himself in the foot since at least 1988, so why chance it?
Also here is how it works Vote for Trump=Trump, Vote for Biden=Biden, Vote for third party=Third Party, Vote for No One=No One. Wanna get us to vote for Biden make him go left, why is the pressure on us to give up what we believe in, why can’t it be on him to win us over.
Why can’t we try to push Biden to the Medicare for All position, why can’t they ever unite on actual progressive issues, why do we constantly have to give up our principles to vote for the lesser of 2 evils? Voting for the lesser of two evils for so long got us Trump.
yes, the VP bashing Biden for not sending out the national guard is probably still the best, but the senator whacking her opponent for taking selfies with her dog instead of solving unemployment or whatever it was, that's pretty wacky too. projection much?
What is interesting is that it hit CPAC early on. Now WH staffers, 🙈🙉🙊 governors who refused to shut down and/or enforce masks in red states are getting hit hard. Small wonder the red states are moving towards Biden. Personal experience has informed their blue vote.
Some Biden allies wage a shadow campaign to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice presidentAt this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
They only ever loved him for what they could get with the Biden name. They’ve all got to get what they can before he’s declared “no use” to them by China and Ukraine, right Hunter!
He is definitely declining. I’m pretty sure they have Biden locked in the house like people have to do with Alzheimer’s family members. Sad!
Yes, elder abuse! Mueller was just the face of that BS, just like Biden is the face now. What’s scary is -who’s pulling the puppet’s strings?!
Yes, where are the people that are supposed to love him? His wife, obviously she is cruel! Jill Biden is a poor excuse for a wife. Sad and disgusting!
Why did the audience clap at the town hall meeting several months ago when he called the guy “fatty” for just asking about Hunter Biden and his enriching himself off of his Biden name?
His wife is a terrible person to do that to him. Shame in Jill Biden.
He’s always gotten by with his BS gift. Gift jo more, just dementia. Shame on Jill Biden, what a b*tch for a wife. Power hungry!
Jill Biden can’t rest until she’s FLOTUS. It’s shameful, disgusting, and sad to watch. They have plenty of money to retire and go away. She’s a cruel wife!
No, it’s not funny, it’s disgusting, and it’s horrifying to watch Jill Biden march Joe Biden out into public for her own benefit, has she no shame?! Terrible!
You, Jill Biden, should be protecting your husband since he is obviously experiencing dementia possibly Alzheimer’s, instead of of parading him in public for your own power grab. Shameful!
Anyone who thinks joe Biden wrote this is naive to a fault. Arguing that he even read it is a stretch...
Biden doesn’t make you cry? Seriously? What are you not paying attention to?
So what? Trump never accepted the endorsement. The premier of the CCP endorses Biden. But I'm sure you're proud of that.
If Biden really can defeat God, we should probably vote for him cause he'd be the biggest badass in politics.
President: Biden over Trump, 324-210, +4% Popular Vote  Senate: Democrats 51, GOP 49  House: Democrats 234, GOP 182
Surely, most people can see who Biden really is and that his prays are real and also should know not to believe anything trump says.
1.) Sippy is wrong on face here; any vote that isn’t affirmatively for Biden is a vote for Trump and all of the failure and cruelty and fascism that comes with that; but  2.) you click the link and I actually agree with her; so  3.) the answer is to never click the link.
Biden did do deliberately
Yeah if there went 20+ other examples of Biden "mistakenly" making racists racist statements.  I mean the guy didn't want to live in the jungle with black people
Lol we know that's not biden.  Its 2 complete sentences put together.  And yeah you said what you mean just like you ain't black if you vote Trump

I think Trump has slipped some from when he was younger like most people once they get into their 70s. But Biden is much worse.  He's approaching full blown senile.
If we told Trump that God is omnipotent so Biden can't hurt him, do you suppose he leave the stage?

I believe Biden just embarrassed himself, again, this morning. A racial comment.
Lol yeah until they see Biden needs to be put in a home due to dementia
It is more like Biden is lagging at 39 points
I’m pretty sure Biden went to pay his respects to John Lewis at the Capital. Did your daddy?
Using  's example of refusing to debate  because everyone already knows who he is, Vice President Biden doesn't need to debate trump even once.  We all know who trump is.  We also know who VP Biden is.  Thanks Jim Inhofe for the tip.
Bro no one cares about debates. There isn’t one thing you could say to get me to vote for you. I’m voting Biden a debate won’t change my mind
Oh and I don’t reply to Biden because I don’t see his tweets in my feed..
Plus, if you spend three months and a hundred million dollars lowering the bar for Joe Biden he’s going to have to declare it as a campaign contribution.
It’s been a minute, but Joe Biden worked Paul Ryan like a speed bag and managed to kick Sarah Palin’s ass so hard that people thought he was an asshole.   This is not a winning strategy.
How do we know if Biden is lying, or just having a senior moment? Asking for everyone.
Doesn’t matter, he was never going to win CA. They have the same number of ElectoralCollege votes if Biden wins by 1% or 40%. 🤷🏻

Or Biden’s just senile and they only let him out for a few minutes at a time when they’ve pumped him full of enough meds to allow him to form half sentences.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Virtual debate would make it even easier to pass the questions to Biden beforehand...you know, like they did Hillary.
I’ve read Biden’s response THREE times and I still can’t figure out what he was trying to say   What is the DNC up to this time.
He’s not gonna hurt Biden. He will hurt trump
I will be well when Joe Biden is our President.  I will be both well and happy if trump and his crime family are indicted.
You should be more terrified if Biden wins. Trillion dollars taxpayer money for the green new deal, amnesty for illegal aliens and guaranteed taxes are raised. He is on the record for all of these.
Opinion vs decision. A better campaign idea would be Trump’s decision  to cancel flights from China vs Biden’s opinion of it
If Biden picks this moron as VP mate it would be the worst team of all time
This isn’t an endorsement of Donald Trump, but to vote for Joe Biden is irresponsible.
Honestly my ~biggest~ problem with Joe Biden is that he can’t do a kickflip
Rest assured Joe Biden can pronounce Yosemite.
That’s because they don’t want their dementia candidate Biden in front of the cameras.

Biden Campaign Says He Is So Close To A VP Pick He Can Smell Her | The Babylon Bee
Biden is in serious cognitive decline and everyone knows it. That’s why they don’t want him to debate. He’ll get embarrassed. He can’t make it through a one minute written speech without getting lost.
There's a great deal of hold out from many who don't want to reveal their choice until election day. If these polls are anywhere near accurate Trump is going to destroy Biden.
Obama picked Biden because he was white and an establishment Democratic with foreign policy experience that some said Obama lacked. It was between Biden and Evan Bayh.
I’m curious to know what the process is if Biden drops out at the last minute, or if he is ruled unfit. Who runs in his place?
Biden is such a lying fraud it's painful
Repeating lies will not make WaPo a better liar!  Biden dug up Anita Hill and then didn’t believe her bs!
It's not just about electing Biden. It's about allowing RBG to retire. It's about replacing Betsy DeVos with someone who cares about educating students. It's about putting component people in charge of national security and economic policy. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

If this is true she’s not a good idea. You are after all trying to get evangelicals to vote Biden
Based on what’s been coming out though if it’s not Senator Harris it’s going to look incredibly bad on Team Biden.
Exactly. Biden is the same thing. Just pandering to a different crowd.
What illegal act did Biden commit?
I think she can do way more as majority leader and do more good. She can craft the Biden policy’s
Biden needs to fire the men that are undercutting a strong black woman.
Q anon and conspiracies. That's the only reason people refuse to see current events for what they are.   Biden is not a shining star, even though Trump and current events make him appear to be. Alex Jones is a close equal to Himmler
Are you living in an alternate universe?  Trump rode in on VP Biden &amp; Pres. Obama's shirt tails after they initiated the successful plan to recover our economy after the 2008 recession. Trump's been on that ride that hadn't stopped until he ignored the pandemic. Fact ☑️ Yourself
He has zero chance of getting elected if he doesn’t debate BDD. Trump will completely destroy Biden though if they do debate.
Following everyone! #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Resist 👊
It truly amazes me that the American people think that a couple geezers, with signs of early onset dementia, are the two best options for President. #Trump #Biden
George W. started two wars and Obama added 5 more. Trump is the only President in the past 20 years who didn’t start a war. And Biden voted for the Iraq war. That’s your candidate.
Nothing surprises me about this. The deep state is still in control and I am afraid the deep state is running the clock on spygate. If Biden gets in all goes away and General Flynn goes to jail.
I’m old enough to remember when the t**mp campaign and the GOP made fun of Vice Pres Biden for suggesting POTUS would suggest delaying the election.
Yes!!! On the day of that rally, I predicted it would kill Cain.
Big tech will guarantee your and our defeat in 2020. Your campaign managers are making Biden appear to be a conservative. That’s so stupid, stupid!
But AOC not too young to be in charge of Department of Energy to which Biden has promised her. So with a Biden victory gasoline prices will skyrocket.
OMG. Is BIDEN "Q" ?!?!?!
Biden couldn’t recognize the button.
Gross. 🤢🤣But Biden isn’t our president nor will he be
Joe Biden said He aint Black
I don’t like Trump, but am unsure of Biden’s capabilities.😞Excellent article on Biden's options for VP.  I'm still on #TeamDuckworth
BLUF:  - China doesn't want Trump to win re-election, seeing him as "unpredictable." - Russia is attacking Biden via multiple means, as they see him as being tougher on Russia. - Iran wants to undermine Trump and further divide the US.
No longer? Biden has shown contempt for black people all of his 48 years in DC. If a Republican had shown a fraction of the racism Biden has, he would have been run out of politics decades ago. Different set of rules for Democrats.
😂😂😂 Kanye West 'admits he's running a spoiler campaign to draw votes from Biden &amp; see Trump reelected' in bizarre interview
Think the blacks that were imprisoned because of Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill think he’s a good man? Did you know that a bill signed by DT, First Step Act, served to release a lot of these blacks?  Biden gave eulogy for Dem Sen Robt Byrd in 2010, a former Klansman. Biden’s a racist.
Well we know pelosi isn’t prayerful for trump I don’t know anything on biden but funny he hasn’t condoned the burning of bibles if he’s for god
I agree with this stance; it sucks but I will commit to getting that awful man and his cruel administration out of office, as well as voting for progressives to take office. Others might disagree, but it's their vote and if Biden couldn't win them it's on him.
There are zero 0 reasons to vote for Biden.
Yeah, but Biden apologized for that comment. The conservative media and Trump are doubling down on this mis-pronunciation.
Folks, Biden's OK-5 numbers are going to come back to Earth as we approach Nov. Not saying he won't win OK-5, but by 8% is a stretch not even an Armstrong can do.  That said, no way Biden loses Okla Co by 10% this time. Races here that were within 10-15% in 2016... look out?!
Fact check: Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox &amp; Friends interview
Any discussion Joe on the latest Biden statement that “blacks, with a few exceptions, don’t have diversity of thought”?  Didn’t think so. Fake News is also ignored news. Biden is a racist. And you’re hiding it.  Pathetic.
Any guests speak to the fact that Biden is considering Representative Karen Bass (D-Ca) as his VP running mate? The same Karen Bass that visited Cuba 8 times and after the death of Fidel Castro, stated it was a great loss for the people of Cuba.   A Communist sympathizer for VP?
So Biden gets to “clarify comments” when saying something overtly racist, but when Trump says anything he’s a racist no matter what he said. Ah I see
Biden &amp; Sanders Collusion🙄.....
🚨Biden: Illegal Immigrants Who Work 'Should Have Access' to Subsidized Health Care!
He cannot pronounce Ulysses, Yosemite and now Thailand. And he claims Biden is mentally unfit. Laughable.
So it's kind of hilarious when the right and/or the anti-anti-Trump left keeps trying to weaponize entirely predictable Biden gaffes. Stupid shit may end up deciding this election (it always can), but that's not the stupid shit that'll do it.
Joe Biden has been so gaffe prone throughout his career that he's essentially immunized against paying any political price for any new gaffes....especially in this day and age when, if you're a white dude, even scandals basically don't matter any more.
Biden has zero chance of winning in a debate with anyone. Unless the Moderators feed him the questions in advance and he has a teleprompter to answer them. Knowing the Dems history of dirty tricks, it wouldn’t shock me to see it.
Big Trump fan huh Ben? Wait until Biden’s your President if you want to appreciate Trump. And believe me, you will appreciate Trump.
Daily reminder,  FUCK JOE BIDEN!
If this were true I’d actually like Biden
Biden is Catholic. He actually practices his faith. Regardless, he treats other people like Christians are supposed to treat others.   It honestly hurts to see this used as a “campaign strategy”
That thing called “racism” just keeps popping up with Bunker Biden. Where’s the Media? Zzzzzz
The real reason - not racial strife - that she upset 'with Trump' is probably because a whole lot of people are pressuring her to become Biden's running mate.
Hello fellow Republicans! Either you put up with our current President or your other choice is socialism. Your choice but I guarantee if Biden wins you’ll be begging for Trump back when we turn into Venezuela.
Against  ✔️God ✔️Guns ✔️Energy If only Joe Biden was actually this cool.
Joe biden is racist
Not a single person voting for Biden can legitimately say they are voting for him because he is a good candidate...they are voting for him simply because it’s not Trump. 🤦‍♂️
He Really Said This: Biden AGAIN Suggests African American Community Is Not Diverse!🍿😏 #KAG2020
Republicans for Biden? What a freaking joke you people are!
Judging by that comment, you've obviously decided to ignore Biden's obvious mental decline (and he started with a pretty low bar).  This says more about  &amp; her TDS than anything else.
👇you want to keep talking about Biden’s stutter ?
Exactly, it's insane. How is 4 more years of this in any way comparable to who Biden picks for VP? Dems give folks like  &amp;  grief for telling them what to do - but they have the totally correct view, item #1 is getting DJT out, everything else can wait.
Joe Biden: CEO of shooting himself in the foot AND sticking that same foot in his mouth.
Remember, Biden’s not going to Milwaukee because ... *checks notes* ... of COVID-19 concerns.
I thought Biden was going to win until Nevada, and then I allowed myself a brief moment of hope
A couple of weeks ago, we had a GOP internal shared with us showing Biden +5 in OK-5.  Now, another from a credible source showing Biden at +8 in OK-5. We're v skeptical of a lead this big, but it's worth noting that the Pres has never been more toxic in Okla Co than he is today.
Ahh yes Mr Swalwell, who lied for over two years about Russian collusion. Any discussion Joe on how dismissive, disrespectful Biden is to black interviewers, first Charlamagne and now Errol Barnett? Didn’t think so.
Any discussions by your All Star cast Joe on Sally Yates testimony in front of Congress where she indicted James Comey for his role in the Crossfire Coup? Anyone honest enough to state WHAT the real reason that in unprecedented fashion, Joe Biden is hiding in his basement? Any?
When you see those Biden numbers from another GOP internal in OK-5...
And here's the most important thing about Veepstakes speculation: it has no effect on anything (least of all Biden's choice). And it will become retroactively even more meaningless once the choice is announced in a matter of days.
Mail-in voting relies on:  Voting rolls being accurate - they rarely are. USPS getting it both to &amp; from the voter reliably - USPS      reliability is about as real as Joe Biden's mental acuity.  Biggest problem (or feature): There is no way to confirm the ID of a mail-in voter.
But that would reward Trump. He does NOT want to debate Biden. He's a TERRIBLE debater.
Shame on you kellyanne , you know joe Biden has a stuttering problem and making fun a persons disability. People who live or work in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Example: your boss , yes omite
It really is.   They’re mocking  regularly and the man is just passionate about his faith in God, and refuses to be told how to think based on the color of his skin.   Biden on the other hand.. guys. Pull him out of the race now. Whatever is going on deserves privacy.
I disagree. Biden needs to stand face-to-face with 45 and call him out for his disinformation. Do Biden’s gaffes worry me? Of course, but the risk that “running from the debates” creates is too much for me.
Just a few thoughts re Biden's interview w/ Errol Barnett:  Brought up the animal ID - mistaking EB for Don LeMon?  Automatically assumed testing a black man = drug test.

😂😂😂 Not only does Biden forget he recently claimed his cognitive skills are “tested” all the time, but also Biden says, “forward looking”, rather than “looking forward “ to debating Trump 😂😂😂 GEEZ

We saw a poll with Biden +5 in OK-5, and he was +9 in Oklahoma County. If this is OK-5 and it's Biden +8 now, things are really damn bleak for the GOP in Oklahoma County, currently.
Biden just put out a nuke of an ad today after Trumps disasterous interview and this is how Trump responds? Has anyone told him there’s an election in &lt;100 days? Can’t be real. Simulation must be ending soon
Google it. All over the place if you want to find it. Biden is corrupt, has dementia, and has sold out to the radicals in the Party. Can’t think of a worse candidate for a major political Party. Broken candidate for a broken Party.
Is that what CNN and MSDNC told you to think James? Biden is corrupt. It would come out if his sycophants in the media weren’t covering for him. What happened to investigative reporters?
“Public servants” shouldn’t be worth millions.  His family, namely his brother and son Hunter have become millionaires because Biden sold his influence.  He did it it Ukraine when he set his son up in a high paying job he had no experience in. Hunter also profited from China deal
If the Biden administration decides not to prosecute, or if Biden decides to issue pardons, the Republicans will laugh and laugh and will say allegations about Trump crimes were lies all along.
I'd vote for civil war if Biden won! We have to protect our constitutional republic. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica
Glad you see great attributes to Joe Biden James S Davidson. His claim to fame is the 1994 crime bill that put thousands of blacks in prison for minor offenses. He has become a multimillionaire as a “public servant”. His corruption in Ukraine is well documented, as well as China.
Oh so the GOP gets to hand pick which states vote by mail, red states yes, blue states no! Wow sounds like something a dictator would say. If you vote for Trump you can vote by mail, but if you vote for Biden you can’t. He’s lost his fucking mind. How can anybody vote for him?
Yes, he just recently said that, we could go on forever. The quid pro quo on video in Ukraine would have finished most politicians. Trump gets impeached for wanting to investigate Biden’s crime. Incredible.
Biden has a lot of things. Unfortunately none of which are things successful Presidents are made of.
Listen, anonymous guy, you don’t know what you’re talking about. UN is merely an informal coalition of Norman voters w shared viewpoints and a common goal. UN doesn’t even have a roster. Saying someone is a “member” of UN is like saying someone is a member of Biden for President.
If 80% of Arizonans vote by mail...  and Democrats are overwhelmingly voting by mail while Republicans are not...  and Biden is leading the polls in AZ...  🤔🤔🤔
You mean Biden’s statements of 125 million Americans dying from Covid-19 or the 150 Million that have died from gun deaths since 2007? And they called Trump “unfit” for office in 2016? Biden thinks he’s running for the US Senate😳
Biden declining fast!
Triggered... your city is going to hell. Thanks to Democratic govenor, mayor congressmen/ women .... they are too worried about cheating by mail in ballots... biden not well... where is he? His wife gotta go  do the interviews ... don’t look good
IF there is a debate, this will happen.  Yet Biden will still prove he couldn't pass a kindergarten entry exam, let alone a cognitive exam.
A debate of any kind between Biden &amp; POTUS would graphically demonstrate that Biden couldn't manage a neighborhood lemonade stand, let alone the U.S. economy.
I picked this at random. Does he stumble over a couple of words, sure, but he always he has. But how you can watch this and not see that it is 100x more coherent than any DJT speech or presser, I do not understand.
No surprise there. They endorsed Obama too. Sure have some fine folks endorsing Biden, Antifa, BLM, Communist Party, Socialist Party, Atheists, Soros, the Devil etc.
Yea, early, like in before the Democrats remove Biden and replace him with, say, someone named Hillary, so a phony-baloney vote for him becomes an even phonier-baloney vote for, say, someone named Hillary?
I share a bday with Biden. I knew I liked you for a reason.
When was the last time you sawJoe Biden speak? I can’t even remember

SAD! Joe Biden Repeats Himself 3 Times in One Minute
The GOP Just Released a 46 Minute Video of Joe Biden Talking Nonsense
Biden is a disgrace to the very tradition that so many have come to take for granted- our privilege of #voting
That and the ongoing, massive failure of the Teump administration to handle the economic and pandemic crises. But as it's axiomatic that #BothSidesDoIt, some equivalent Biden failing must be found.
Why is this even a question?   The #BidenVP pick has got to be the most consequential wingman selection in our history. Joe Biden will be in such a cognitive decline by the time he’s sworn in that VP will be our next president if Biden pulls of a miracle with the W.
Will just one of your guests be honest enough to address the obvious cognitive decline in Joe Biden?A growing sentiment from Dems is  “Joe don’t debate”.The guy that gets a teleprompter at a news conference is declining rapidly, and no one at MSDNC is honest enough to address it.
On a scale of “1 → Biden” - how confused are you? 😎😂  #TrumpsGotJokes  #MyPresident
My biggest fear is that Biden will make a huge stumble that can't be undone.
Except we need to see how biden can preform on the fly , no prescreened questions so a wers can be put on a teleprompter ... we need to see the unscripted biden.
Yeah who else you sending those to. All the illegals, dead people, people in prison, convicted criminals. Send them to all you want, Biden still loses. Man doesn't know what year it is. #Trump2020 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
That's somewhat true. Biden has done zero in all the yrs he's been in government! Trump's done way more than he promissed! Great pres. Another 8 yrs.!!! Then his son!
AG Barr said that the DOJ would not interfere in the election, going so far as to exclude Biden from investigation or accountability. This is why he shouldn’t hold back on the Deep State.
will the Deep State elites continue to avoid accountability for their crimes? Apparently abuse of power is the key to escaping criminal conduct. 🤦🏻‍♂️ #Obama #Biden
Bold prediction:  Whatever your favored narrative about Biden and his presidential campaign is and whoever he picks as his running mate, you will be able to spin the pick as evidence that your narrative is correct.  Posts that do just that will dominate this hellsite for days.
If Biden can't debate, how is he going to negotiate?
What changed is the left controls the Democratic Party, and they control Joe Biden. I think that is now apparent to most everyone.
Kamala Harris is well-qualified by experience, political engagement and charisma. She is the right choice for Joe Biden.
My thoughts on this issue over the past month or so.  Dems- White people are ALL racist!  Also Dems-Biden MUST pick a woman of color ME-if white people make up the majority of voters, and they’re all racist, isn’t selecting a woman of color political suidice?
Will anyone address the Obama coup attempt on Trump?  Ignoring this like you did the other side on Russia collusion huh?  Anything today on Biden’s dementia which has put his campaign in a basement? Is that how he would run a Presidency too? “Fake News” is also “ignored” News.

No. Biden could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and I would still vote for him.
Incompetent and you’re voting for Biden?  Oh my.
exactly. which is what i’ve been trying to do by donating to progressives for the house and senate. by no means do i want trump. and m4a isn’t my only issue i care about. i just want biden to enact change instead of running on empty platitudes
which is why in the past few months i’ve donated to progressive candidates who will actually work for the people in the senate and the house. i’m not out here saying “if i don’t get this i won’t vote” i just wish biden would stand up to his donors
so we should just be okay with the dems not even trying it? also never said i wasn’t voting for biden. i can want him to do better and still vote for him. if they really wanted our votes, they would support popular policies. their choices make it seem otherwise
if any of y’all feel the urge to call me a trump supporter i will kindly remind you that i voted for hillary and will more than likely vote biden so keep your dumbass comment to yourself. sorry i want the dnc to actually enact change and not just run on vague promises
yes i am singlehandedly responsible. my one (1) vote in oklahoma will be the reason trump wins. also, to equate me to a trump supporter takes a lot of cognitive dissonance. just because i want biden and the dnc to be better and actually enact the “change” that they run on. smh
i’m just simply stating that the dnc will be to blame if biden doesn’t win. I DONT want people to die needlessly, hence my support for a universal health care system. also never said i wasn’t voting for that “imperfect friend” so
Stop lying.  Biden has not called to "defund the police."  His proposal adds $300 million to community policing efforts.  Biden has said "I don't support defunding police."   Source:
Biden was presumptive nominee when Yang endorsed him too
Have you seen CNN and MSDNC lately Helen?  They take up for rioters.  They think the Mayors of Portland, Seattle and NYC are doing a good job. They think Biden should stay in the basement.Wonder how the State if the Union address would go over from there if he won the Presidency?
He might be referring to Biden's actual skeleton?
Well it was done by libotards, it was OK’ed by libotards, and it was verified by libotards. Yep, thanks for yet another fine example of dumbing down America.   I guess they were preparing early for Biden.
To most anyone but his sycophants in the media, it is going to be extremely hard for Joe and the Democrats to convince anyone he’s still a moderate. Bernie the Commie even said Biden would be the most progressive Prez ever if elected.
needed to press  about his co-chair’s comment about voting for Biden= eating a bowl of shit. The Bernie bros still trolling dem and Biden posts here, and FB. #MSNBC
THIS ^   I really don’t want to hear 45 speak.   His voices makes me ill.  I’d rather see Biden’s skivveys.
Hearing more and more Democrats are advising Joe Biden not to debate Trump. The man vying for the highest office in our Country, and those in his Party want him to continue to hide? What else would he hide from, the G7Summit? The State of the Union Speech? Addresses to Congress?

"Very fine people on both sides"- Donald Trump, after a White Supremacist ran over and killed a peaceful protester in Virginia. Joe Biden sat in a church with black leaders to fix social injustice.  But if someone is white we can say that they don't support racial equality right?
I would tweet that now I will vote for Biden but I was always gonna vote for Biden.
She is a fan of Fidel Castro. Probably means she’s a Communist too.  Sure glad the Democrat Party hasn’t moved left and Biden’s a “moderate”.
But let’s talk about Hunter Biden and Chelsea Clinton.
So tired of hearing what needs to be done to keep the Bernie people happy. Joe Biden is going to do infinite amounts to move this country toward a progressive agenda than DJT would. Biden should be picking who can best govern the country if something happens to him, full stop.
The only thing that will get Biden on that Debate stage is for him to be behind in the polls. Hiding out has been working for him. Why change? The savior of the Socialist Party is hiding. Tells you all you need to know.
This would never happen. Biden looks forward to debating Trump.
Still, fuck Biden, but this is pretty funny!
It would just be a bunch of deflecting, name calling, lying and sniffling on Trumps part. I don’t think a debate is beneficial. I’m with Biden no matter what
So it's very, very important not to let the most lauded phase of the ongoing Black freedom struggle fade far into the rearview mirror. Joe Biden, e.g., was already in junior high school when the Montgomery Bus Boycott began in late 1955.
Sounds like the Bernie/Biden platform to me slick.

This is unfortunate. Didn't know much about Bass. Now I think much less well of her. Not that it matters. I have no say in VP selection. And I'm voting for Biden, not the bottom of the ticket. But I hope he selects a VP who doesn't praise avaricious, life-destroying cults.
Really? With the mother in ear shot? Nope. Not buying it. At best it’s an assumption that’s what he’s saying because you can’t really hear those words. Don’t get me wrong, I loathe Biden. 😂😂
But it would have had to been worse under a Biden Presidency as Joe called Trump xenophobic for stopping flights coming in from China on 1/31.  When would have Joe stopped the flights if ever? Does Joe know what day it is?  Get lost fool.
I do mail in ballot. but I can guarantee one thing , if they close I’ll crawl across glass to vote for joe Biden!
Does anything make you madder than seeing so called Republicans like  Michael Steele, Ana Navarro, Jennifer Rubin  and Steve Schmidt attack our President while embracing a empty suit, leftist political hack like Joe Biden? RINOS exposed.

"So you think the Republicans that are upset will stay home and insure Biden’s election?"  No.  knows Trump needs independent voters.  So far, I believe Trump will get them. Mish doesn't.  We'll see what happens.
Every few hours you tweet this stuff. You think you know all Americans. You don’t and it’s time you got if that sort of elitism. If Biden wins, we all lose including you. Virtue signaling is practiced by a lot iof non-virtuous folks.
I truly don’t get it. No one is saying Biden is perfect or progressive. Why can’t we elect him and then criticize him once he’s in? He’s the candidate now. The other guy doesn’t even want to let you vote. (Reposted this as earlier it was just a screen grab and it’s a long story)

This should be obvious, but there's nothing noble or admirable about not being able to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Even the 99% of GOPers who support the president and fascism don't engage in this peculiar form of political idiocy.
Nunes apparently getting information with Russia-friendly sources for opposition research on Biden.
Trump vs Biden 2020. What if a third party candidate could win? Especially if they owned the middle ground middle class American with all cabinet positions released before the election.  What an experience that’d be for our political system, a true American that sees both sides.
Don't worry; if Biden loses, that's on progressive's shoulders and about the only thing they would ever give us credit on affecting, even though they are bending over backwards to lose this election and capitulate to Republicans. 🤷‍♀️
I’ve got my popcorn WAITING for that debate. Trump will eat him alive. It’s a lose/lose for you. If Biden debates, Trump makes a fool of him. If he doesn’t, Trump still wins. Please, continue to stay “woke” though. 😆
I have now! We needed this, especially today. I'm in the middle of a bright red neighborhood in a bright red state (OK).  I have yet to see any Trump signs (yea) but also have yet to see any Biden signs. I'm sure when we get our Biden sign it will be vandalized.
The left was already scraping the underside of the barrel when they realized biden is the best that they had to offer. One sniffed his way up while the other...well you know the thingy things she did lmao
😂😂😂 someone sounds scared of Biden winning soon
The biggest challenge for Biden promoting media between now and November 3rd?  To convince the Nation that Joe Biden still has control of his mental faculties, that he is a moderate politically, and that he is free from corruption during his 48 years in DC.

Mr Biden, if you feel so strongly about this issue, why don't you debate President Trump and tell the American people, that recently purchased AR styled firearms for their protection, that you are coming after those firearms and dont care that you will leave them defenseless.

That is why I say I blame them for Trump and I am not donating money to the project. But I don’t see how you can blame them for not doing stuff they have no power to do. I am glad they are doing these ads. It is the least they could do. The very least. That and voting for Biden.

um...no, she's not. based on her not being born here, she shouldn't be allowed to be on the ticket, because if biden is removed from office, we would have a non American as President, and we all know that's not Constitutionally allowed

So basically she is saying she lied trying to defeat Biden. That means now she will lie to try and defeat  #ItWasADebate
Kamala knows what she is, her state knows what she is. Problem is now, CNN wants to help reinvent her. 2% in the polls Harris, ppl knew she was fake AF, broke laws, hurt the minority communities, hell it's no wonder racist Biden picked her! #Trump2020
Kamala was quick to try and block someone not credibly accused, while now joining up with Biden, who has been credibly accused of sexual assault. Par for the course.
Setting aside the glaring legal issues here...  Montana?! The state where he won by 20 point in 2016? Where even if by some act of God Biden were to win, he’d only pick up 3 electoral votes?  Seriously?!
This New Trump Video Mocking Enthusiasm for Biden Needs to Be Seen to Be Believed
That right there is sheer projection. Biden spoke at 2 kkk members funerals, he supported segreegation, &amp; I can go on and on.  Trump never did.  His father was at a protest as a bystander &amp; that's been proven. So, not sure why you even bring up what Dems have done as a Rep issue
Kamala Harris' Favorability Rating Higher Than Trump, Pence and Biden's: Poll
You referred to Kanye and Nick Cannon as "paid slaves." Way to reinforce Joe Biden's description of black people lacking diversity of thought. You're acting no better than a Democrat party plantation overseer by attacking prominent black men for being free thinkers.
The campaign hopes the haul is the beginning of a prolific fundraising push in the final stretch before Election Day.
And they are going with Biden is on cognitive decline. This moron  can’t even read.
Everyone checking it out at once is probably bogging down their system.  I've seen enough.  If Biden wins it'll be because he cheated.  No way any American that sees this would vote for him. Only someone anti-American wants to destroy our country.
Was that the liars club I watch with Biden and Harris
But yet you think Biden's cognitive decline into Alzheimer's is ok? The man can't even read cue cards! Y'all are pathetic hypocrites!!🤣🤣
Is Fox News' Jeanine Pirro Advocating Violence Against Biden⁉️
After watching the VP rollout, my eyes has seen the #GodBeTheGlory satisfied with the VP pick, wasn't my 1st choice, after watching  and her words rang true!!! I got excited that help is on the way. Biden/Harris🇺🇸
Rudy declared Wednesday that if a future administration under  Joe Biden tried to prosecute President Donald Trump ― as Giuliani himself has repeatedly advocated for Obama administration figures ― the country would devolve into a “banana republic.”
I realize the fight has just begun, but I’m ecstatic with the democratic ticket! I’ve already cried (happy tears) 3 times watching the morning news! Anytime I see Biden &amp; Harris, I feel hope. I feel proud. 🇺🇸♥️🤍💙#BidenHarris2020
Great visual - the trump train will plow through your town at break neck speeds and blow right past the things you need to have addressed while blowing environmental needs away. The Biden team will see each need as it comes and act with purpose and determination. #flipitblue
Hahahahaha! OMG! Sooooo funny! That dumb MF don’t know what to do about Kamala Harris or Joe Biden! But what he should do, is get the hell out of the way because he’s going to lose!
So we feeling pretty good about Harris v Pence on the debate zoom. What do we think about Biden v Trump? Like Bernie couldn't be bullied Biden tends to take the bait on a slight.   #debatethoughts
Joe Biden....The HEAD of ANTIFA!!
I’m pretty sure that Kamala Harris was born in India and Biden in a small village somewhere in Ireland.  I’ve heard many people say this.

All so delusional! Those that had zero respect for former divisive president did not stomp our feet and suck our thumbs...  or tear up the country gleefully.  Dems goals and policies are disaster.  Get off the government payroll Biden! 50 years of nothing is enough.
She also said she believed Biden's accusors soooo.  Give'em hell is right, how many innocent people is she responsible for locking up.

Bend, Oregon activists block ICE bus, prompting federal agents' response  #FoxNews.  ICE ,which Biden will dismantle along with Police, tries to to protect us from illegals and their criminal bs. Vote Red to keep ICE.
I stopped reading at "...Joe Biden tapping a woman..."
I thought Biden would blow it for Biden. The left hate Trump so much they are willing to put any Marxist in charge.
Trump is the one who tackled this issue.  Biden and Barry did NOTHING.

UPDATE: MSNBC and CNN Doctor Image of Biden Calling Kamala Harris with a Cheat Sheet Script! — And Old Joe Was Holding His Phone Upside-Down
Biden/Harris!!! I'm seeing a legit and stellar cabinet lineup in the works 💁🏻‍♀️✅✅🤟🤟
Kristen it would be hypocrital if you don’t also correct Joe Biden for not knowing how to pronounce his running mates name correctly.
At least Biden looks more approachable. You're in that giant speeding train. He's even gettin' exercise which more than I can say of you golf cart boy.
Trump didn't cause the virus, and Joe Biden is responsible for millions of Americans locked up, and surely some who unfairly died in prison. How is that better?
Do you really think Biden and Harris can run this country?  No is the correct answer
Lmao white privlage doesn’t exist y’all trippin on some Hidin Biden Bullshit
Well Vickie, I mean my tweet to you was pretty straightforward in that it was a question based on your tweet about Biden-Harris. Had nothing to do with  but I’m glad you acknowledge you can’t even follow a simple question (or realize I was joking about all.the.way)
Sadly these Negoes allow it. Biden said the same about Obama and noone on the left and no WOKE black person spoke up about it. Pityful.
Trump isn’t responsible for the deaths. If you think that we need to shut this whole country down and have nothing going then you are in sane. If you support Biden in Harris you support socialism which is an essence communism. That won’t fly here in the United States
Kids in cages happened under Obama/Biden in 2014. Every one of you liberals keeps trying to blame Trump for that and it’s not his fault for that. Trump took action against the virus and his travel bans. The Democrats called him everything in the book 1/2
Trump didn’t separate kids from families. That started in 2014 under Obama/Biden. Blame it on the right people.. It’s the Democrats that haven’t come to the table and negotiated anything
You can follow Jesus and be totally confident that Trump is doing more Christian things then Biden or Harris have ever done. If you support abortion you cannot support Jesus would be a follower either.
First of all children in cages happened in 2014 under Obama/Biden. That was in Trump. And Jesus didn’t deny healthcare. If that was the case he wouldn’t have healed the people that he did. Keep up with your false teaching. The Bible warned us Christians about people like you
24 Hours After Biden Picks Harris For VP, Her 10 Dirty Secrets Come Falling Out Of The Closet  This political blog makes some very good points for which Kamateau  needs to be ready to respond. She’s as black as Barack Obama and not a cop.

Trump has helped more minorities with getting jobs and prison reform. Biden never did that in 50 years
Um no Biden is a racist
That’s on the memo all you folks got? Ok everyone....use the term “radical left” in every comment involving Biden, Harris, Pelosi, etc...because seriously, we don’t have shit to run on...”.
Really? Good Lord you are ready to fuck everyone completely over under Trump. If Trump stays in office this country is over. Period. I didn't want Biden/Harris but they won't destroy the Constitution. They won't reverse gay marriage or Row v Wade. They won't stop SS &amp; Medicare.
Soooo ... she has the hots for Biden.
Biden has been asleep longer than 4 years.   His comatose sleep started in 2008-09.  He has been living in an imaginary &amp; delusional world since.
Biden has been in politics for 50 years and hasn't done a damn thing😂🤷🏾‍♂️
Kamala is doing the same thing she accused Biden of doing. Dividing this country by race &amp; political bullshit. #WakeUpAmerica #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Who thinks the BLM donations are actually donations to Biden?
Please tell me more Mrs. Blackburn. You just might be able to convince me to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. They sure as spit ain't doin' it on their own.
Yes Joe Biden's a racist along with every single American. As a lifelong Christian with a preacher in our family we collectively reject Trump as a man of no faith in Christ. He doesn't even know any of the Bible and breaks Commandments daily. False Prophet
At this point I feel like third party votes will just get Trump elected :( there are too many people who are resigned (excited even!) to vote Biden/Harris. Soooo fuckin lame.
I actually didn’t think Biden could lose at this point, however adding someone that was garnering around 2% of the vote when you had to drop out of the primary could actually do the trick. When identity politics goes wrong...
Biden &amp; Harris all the way
When Biden wins, get ready for America to punish Trump. I personally can't wait to see him scream and bitch at his trial and after they drag Trump and his corrupt family off to prison.
Heaven forbid Joe Biden becomes president, Kamela will  become president eventually. Everyone is aware Joe Biden won’t be able to run this country.
Biden is the enemy of the poor.
“I wanted to highlight a kind of odd situation. In the last hour or so, if you googled ‘ it would take you straight to Joe Biden’s website — his official campaign website — odd situation,” Rion said, adding, “We don’t know who’s behind that.”  #ONEV1
Even Tara Reade has ALREADY said in an interview that Joe Biden was always a very kind, nice man to work for. She was pulled in by the Republicans for this LIE , no doubt about it.
Tara reads LIED!! If you cannot see that then you have blinders on. Are you kidding me? NoI one but a neighbor (she likely called for backup) 40 years ago suddenly remembered?!? And her brother. Periodi. No one else who worked around them ever saw that in Joe Biden. So it’s BS.
Trump wants us all to be able to do that. Biden only wants his buddies to be able to do it and the rest of us to pay for it!
TLDR. You cannot ask people to vote for Biden just cus “it’s the lesser of two evils”
LOVE him!  #WheresFauci?  Is he in the basement with Biden?
Nope, ridin with Biden. Back the blue wave!
Yeh because Joe Biden certainly can't and she can do what she does best
Biden is lying. He condemned white supremacists when he said it. He did not "call white supremacists very fine people"
Biden sure will.
its litearlly fucking already over none of your ideas or opinions relate to waht will happen in november at alll...before biden picked a vp it was like everyone unerstood this and yet

Inside Biden’s unusual VP pick process: Tough questions, 11 finalists and many lawyers
Is sowing discord within the DNC your goal with this tweet?  Because that’s the result. Look at all your #YangGang fans turning against the Democratic Party and swearing they won’t vote for Biden.
So his endorsement was to guarantee a speaking part at the convention? It wasn’t because he prefers Biden to the orange idiot?
Joe Biden spoke at a KKK klansman’s funeral who was his friend.
Why is it that everytime a Black person runs for high office we hear about how articulate they are? As if it wonder when there is an articulate  Negro. Heard a CNN or MSNBC talk about how articulate  Biden's VP choice, Camel Hair, is.
Not only are you a liar  , you are stupid too!  Americans know the real savior of our economy is    What he inherited from Obama/Biden was a bag full of traitors and a mess of an economy. Expansion....🤣😂 God Bless the USA &amp; President Trump! 🇺🇸
Not Biden for sure.
Who you talkin bout? Biden or Obama? Or BOTH?
This is crazy my wife put this in the Comments of a Joe Biden speech just once and was Instantly kicked off and sent this message by Facebook.

This election equates to do you want Syphilis(Biden) or Gonorrhea(Trump)?🙄🤔🤦🏾‍♂️😂🤷🏾‍♂️
The most tragic thing is over 160,000 people have died from the #coronavirus and it didn’t have to be this way. When Obama and Biden, were in office and Ebola came around, ONLY 2 Americans died.....(2) That’s what you call leadership....in a crisis!
Sanity.   #BidenHarris
Our local FOX channel here in Tulsa, OK did a 1st today. They televised Biden/Harris instead of Trump. Bottom of screen said you could watch Trump on their app. I’m shocked! 😱😁🥳

Apparently Joe Biden picking 1 of his 2 narrowed options, chosen for race &amp; sex, specifically the one that called him a racist, is an 11. Great critical thinking, Jennifer.
Conservative Reporters need to ask the question and know his gonna blow. It only proves what we already know!  Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump
If you believe Tara, Biden says don't vote for him

lmao bitch if you dont think dems and republicans are colluding to slowly strangle your rights then you are a smooth brain. the two party system is a smokescreen. biden wants the same thing as trump. total control
Can someone please tell me if the Biden/Harris speeches were broadcast on all the networks?  Thank you.
Only if they don’t want people to realize that Biden was chosen by a black President twice as a running mate. Biden chose made a historical move in choosing a black woman as his running mate.  But sure he’s racist 😂😂
Explain to me why  did not excommunicate Biden and Pelosi??
I was too busy watching Biden/Harris. Not that was electrifying! 💪
Lol have you noticed since Trump has been in office attacks on the US have been almost non existent. As soon a Biden takes office if he wins, they will start right back up.
Has she changed her belief?  If so, why did she do so?
Biden and his newly chosen running mate campaigned together for the first time today, as the former primary rivals sought to solidify their advantage over President Trump and secure their place in American history.
After their first formal appearance together as a presidential ticket what do you think of Biden/Harris? Who will win? So far Trump/Pence is way in the lead with 68%.
I bet Biden reads his Intel briefing every day.
I can’t stand Trump and I can’t stand Biden. This sucks man
Who said I wasn't voting for Biden? Why do you keep making strawman arguments against me? Are you embarrassed and this is like a weird  defense mechanism?
Old creepy bumbling Biden.
I think I just had an orgasm watching Biden/ Harris.
Biden has an anti gay history, Trump does not
OMG, this is hilarious!  I just did it and after you type  it does go straight to   That is too cool!!! Love whoever is the keyboard warrior who did this!!!
Joe  - “unlike the African American community, the Latino community is incredibly diverse-“ - “poor kids are just as bright as white kids” - “if you don’t know whether you’re for me or for Trump, you ain’t black!”  Biden
Okay everyone. On 3 everyone will forget the attack on Biden from Harris. She called him a racist among other allegations. On 3, we pretend it never happened.  1..... 2..... 3  Hey look! Puppies!
Biden and Harris are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working to restore LAW AND ORDER.
Phony Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s new liberal handler.
I get people wanting trump out of office but.. Biden??? After the #metoo movement?? Just a thought.
This Biden speech is absolutely amazing and Presidential as all get out.
Hearing Kamala talk about Joe Biden reminds me of this:    Cure the #TrumpCancer and eradicate the #TrumpVirus   VOTE #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica
Joe Biden has no real solutions for our country. Bashing Trump is all he has.
Omg. I'm listening to Biden and crying like a baby.
SPECIAL REPORT: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their first joint appearance.
They only mean something if you're a republican law abiding citizen. Sadly the girl accusing Biden probably wont get justice because all the demonrats dont care because it doesn't fit their agenda.
At Biden/Harris event - they're late, and the reason the campaign is saying is some power issues but there have been no lighting problems, etc in the gym where they are having it.  Suppose the power issue is trying to power #JoeChina up?
A vote for Biden is a vote for Harris.

I knew u was full of crap before Tulsi Gabbard exposed u. The sad thing is everybody seen her expose u and act like u good for the country! You no better than Trump! Biden is no better than Trump! Amerikkka is a joke! It's only going to get worse! You chumps won't make a change
"if and when Biden decides to step aside"
That’s weird, you haven’t expressed this excitement for Biden vs Trump?
Scared of Joe Biden? The guy doesn’t know where he is most of the time and it shows every time he speaks. And Kamala Harris is a Christmas in August gift to Republicans. She is so unliked by even Democrats that she even dropped out before the primaries.
Fuck Biden in his dead brain
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
He stopped the flights incoming from China while Pelosi was telling everyone to come to China Town because it was safe. The rest was the failures of Democratic leadership from mayors &amp; govenors. Also if he spied on Biden it would probably be a horror film. GD Pedophiles.
Remember when kamala said she believes everyone of Biden’s accusers. What happen there? Hush money I assume
Gross. We need to shed more light on this. World wide pedophilia ring going on right now. Her &amp; Biden are complicit. KLM!
wouldn’t it be great if the presidential debate was just Biden and Trump going back and forth with “it’s the ____________ for me”
Biden/ Harris:  We won't kill your kids!  (Unless they aren't fit for slave labor- then all bets are off).
Ration that insulin right- or it's really YOUR fault, isn't it?  Biden/Harris 2020  We'll only kill your kids if you're poor.
It’s very strange. She was a disaster in the primary after expecting to be a contender. And suddenly everyone is acting like this is some huge swing Biden’s way. If Biden wins it will have NOTHING to do with her
I mean he didn't get impeached. Cause he still has power and he's still the president. And I wouldn't be so sure about him not getting elected lol. Biden and Harris going to have their own hoops to jump through.
Hey, Dawn, did you see this? Holycrap 😮 nobody that's sane can deny that Biden is a full-blown racist.
You’re delusional! This suburban “housewife” is voting for Biden!
Looks like we will have a Glorious victory since the DemoCracks sealed the deal Trump winning due to Biden electing the evil cultist Kamela Harris as his Vice! #Trump2020 #MAGA2020 #KAG2020 #Patriot #Veteran…
Weaponizing religion: Trump's attacks on Biden's faith, calling him 'against God'
Nope, it was just a matter of being Hunter Biden...I can't imagine anyone else getting that treatment.
Voting third party is essentially voting for biden. A third party candidate is never going to win in our two party system. It's sickening
body language here- 1000% supportive of joe Biden?  lol
I agree 100% on that one...hate to be Captain Obvious, but I think he just thought because he was Joe Biden's son, he could do whatever he wanted, which is what he's used to.
This makes me think of that scene in Braveheart where William Wallace is saying to Robert the Bruce 'just lead them..."   The point being, these people (Kamala/Biden/Pelosi) are in positions of power and would be better off doing something good w/it.
The ugly visages of the promoters for Biden/Harris are so hateful. Their voices and speech patterns obnoxious.  These two demented and hater of America are what Dims/media/Rinos want.  A Godless Communist Government. Unbelievable
This is her saying... “I’m not going to outwardly support Trump, but I’m not above creating false statements against his opponents.” Don’t get me wrong, Harris AND Biden are Left... but not radical.
When Biden gets elected then pulls of his mask scooby doo style and reveals that he’s been Michelle Obama this entire time and then heals the entire world and wraps us in a tight hug with her ripped arms

Biden desegregated a school system?
Please you dont work, now your just lying lmao. Workers approve of Trump.  Free loaders approve Biden.
You're in a heavily contested state with lots of electoral points, and LOTS of idiots. Biden absolutely sucks, but Trump is a fascist who doesn't believe climate change is real. Please vote for Biden
I completely agree with you on that. Both sides don’t have much to work with, but with that selection of VP I can’t go that way. Biden won’t last a full year and eventually she’ll take over and I’m not for that.
maybe they could put out a letter about what they'd do if Trump used sketchy FISA warrants and political appointees  to spy on Biden
Harris could not be president if Biden went down. Her parents were not citizens when she was born
The small govt card is not valid after federal troops invade and illegally detain citizens exercising their constitutional rights. Voting for Biden/Harris will ensure that every city doesn't become another Portland
I think black people are way smarter than Trump gives them credit for when he puts Kanye West on the ballots of a couple of swing states in order to draw votes away from Joe Biden. They surely must realize a Joke Vote will only come back to bite them in the ass.

Too many leftists still act like liberals sadly. You can tell someone is full of ignorance by the way they act towards Biden/Harris.
The former primary rivals will appear at a high school near Biden's Delaware home to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Trump.
We’ll see if the people of CA will give her a vote or not.  If CA doesn’t turn red, then they deserve all that Biden/Harris have in store for them including higher taxes. So get out now and move if you want your vote to count.
you may not like biden or kamala and neither do i but there will be no chance for positive change again if trump wins and fills another supreme court seat this will do permanent damage you must vote for biden to save lgbt equality laws and roe v wade
I can't vote for someone who thinks trans women should be locked up with men. Hard stop. Biden had a large field of candidates he could pick from including Bernie which would have united the left and he chose a cop. At a time when defunding the police is a moderate popular stance

Wrong. Cops need to be investigated to ensure the white nationalists are gone.  And if you beleive the propaganda threat moderate Biden and Harris would defund the police you are buying the propaganda.   First, demilitarize the police and return them to “Protect and Serve”

Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major ticket  &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
Yesterday Joe Biden, under pressure from the radical left, selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Not by the content of her character  but by the COLOR OF HER SKIN.  Not Martin Luther King's dream of "judging by content of character not by color of skin".
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will be the states I’m watching.  Trump-Pence or Biden-Harris will be determined by you.
At least Biden picked a VP he could stand behind. #Sorry #BidenHarris2020
Nothing compared to what will happen if Biden elected.
The party leadership installs the nominee replacement.  The next highest delegate count replaces a presumptive.  Biden stepping down doesn't help Kamala.  Unless HRC is okay with someone else being the 1st female POTUS; it won't be Kamala.  Y'all are adding unnecessary steps.
Trump’s 2020 religious attack on Biden harks back to 1800
I think you're adding a step.   Convention ends, Biden steps down; HRC is announced as top of ticket.   Why do you think the party leadership installed Harris's staff for her before announcing her?  👀 Making sure she doesn't go rogue, like Trump did in 2016.

Biden/Harris... putting black Americans in prison in record number for decades
Kind of fitting that she would run with Biden who I truly believe is racist....sad that it is being hiden
it's cool how liberals are like "just vote for biden and then we can hold him accountable once he's in office" but then if you're like "what's up with this insanely racist law he passed" it turns out they meant a different kind of accountability, somehow

Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate  via
I am Catholic and will vote Biden-Harris. Voting for Trump is intrinsically evil.
Biden: I’m not sure you’re the right fit. Harris: I use Pantene. Biden: Welcome to the ticket.
Come on, Biden has been a life long politician and now he will “fix” things. 😂 shouldn’t he have already been doing that? Harris a former prosecutor and AG who’s stance was tough on crime. Seems like a solid ticket to keep the Cheeto in office.
I am telling you, they will try to have Trump debate Harris. Basically be saying that Biden would tear him to pieces, so that Trump would have a chance, Biden will send in the Apprentice.  Jokes on him, Trump knows how to handle those too.
Really...suburban housewife? Lol! Just keep digging your grave with your cluelessness. Biden/Harris 2020!
Why? To fact check combat a post going viral on FB about Harris not being qualified for the office should anything happen to Biden, if elected, because her parents weren’t born in the US. 100% false. She was born in California and that’s the qualifying factor that matters. (2/2)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The dry dream and wet fart option on the 2020 ballot.
Biden said he would pick a woman
Let’s be honest. In 2016, HRC was the worst candidate in the history of candidates. Republicans couldn’t have that. Instead of learning a lesson, Democrats are now outdoing themselves with the Biden/Harris ticket. Blame yourselves. Hail to that red hat wearing 2-term booger.
Biden /Harris yes!
Her authoritarian policies preclude her from libertarian support. Did you know that you can be polite without sounding like you are on the Biden/Harris campaign team? You’ve abandoned your party, pandering to identity politics twice now. #MAGA2020 I guess.
Keen observers point out unusual elements of Biden’s Instagram post with Harris
The Chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party speaks out about Biden's choice of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.
BIDEN'S HISTORIC VP  The comment we've heard most often about Senator Joe Biden's VP nominee KAMALA HARRIS:  "She's a fighter."
Exactly.  Biden’s not courting Democrats.  This isn’t the Primary.
*joe biden, coming into frame as he's riding a bicycle*  fox news reporter: "joe, joe, who's your pick going to be for vice president?" joe biden: "your mom!" *camera pans over as joe is seen riding off into the sunset*
I really don’t think they will win. I hope they don’t. Trump is such a dousch but I’d prefer 4 more years of his idiocy than 4 - 8 years of yet another Clinton presidency. Trump is a very broken person. He’s embarrassingly stupid. Biden/Harris and their crew are EVIL.
Donald Trump Donated to Kamala Harris’ Campaigns—Twice  via
Dems overthought themselves into Biden. DNC overthought itself into convincing themselves they could get away with what they wanted all along in Harris.  The announcement was a random fart in the midst of a confused muddle. Classic for minimizing blowback.
Because Biden doesn’t have to prove his penis is bigger!  #lame
Well he did say he was "only" 99% sure. At a time when many were assuming Biden had as much chance of nomination in '20 as Tromp did in '16.
My vote is going straight to Biden
And Biden is supposedly losing it? Try and read one of Trumps typical word vomits and make any sense of it.
Yes, this hypocritical communist is who Biden wants to "help run the country."
If Biden wins every state Hillary did (he will) and adds Michigan (99% chance he will), he only needs one more state and he’s President.
*Heard Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as veep today. Thought he committed 2 pickn a Black woman. Nevertheless, congrats 2 James "Kamala" Harris for joining Joe's ticket. Might be a problem tho as "Kamala" is reportedly less lively than Joe havn died a couple of days ago.*
Convention/ Biden bail/ HRC top-of-ticket/ Lose to Trump.  R #evolution?
Joe Biden pick one of the most unliked presidential candidates of 2020 to be his Vice President. Her only qualification she’s a woman who pretends to be African American
She’s probably under criminal investigation but again Joe Biden might be too
I’m more of the flip the red and blue states to green. I lean alil more on red myself but both suck right now I just can’t vote for Biden if anyone takes offense to that you shouldn’t because I don’t take offense to you voting for Biden to each his own we’re all fuck either way
Go look at joe Biden’s too 75% donors. All coastal billionaires!!! I shit you not!
I hope Biden doesn’t put Kamala Harris in charge of Campaign Strategy, or they will run out of money two months before the election
Dude she believes what she said about him. Kamala has an agenda. Her agreeing to do VP on this ticket is bc she will become the next POTIS simply bc Joe Biden is 102 years old. A 95% chance she Harry S. Truman's this shit and succeeds in office. I kind of like her but dems reek.
like at this point, he could have chosen 4 possums in a trench coat as his fucking running mate and i would still smile all the way to the voting booth to vote for Biden. i do. not. care.

Now that Spurs have signed Hojbjerg and Biden has named his VP, we just need a Treasury Secretary, AG, and another option at Right Back to be ready for 2021.
And you both are racists . You push divide when we need to be working together . You  are the only president in our history to not honor the peaceful transfer of power . You are such a disgrace . Hey Biden how many millions did you make from Ukraine and China ?
See the side that she belongs to is the Biden side that speaks for all black people
You moderate Democrats are so stupid it’s ridiculous, how about instead of blasting people for thinking that they are doing the right thing, maybe try to explain to them why you believe that Biden is worth the vote.
Biden’s a joke.
Bernie and Biden’s teams came together to write the Biden climate platform
Woot woot! So excited that  was chosen as Biden’s running mate! #BidenHarris2020
Could you explain why you don't like Kamala Harris? I've read up on her and from what I've read, she seems to be a good pick. Is it just because Biden picked her? I legitimately want to know what you think
And I hope this isn’t interpreted as a “wasted vote” argument. I don’t think any type of voting is a waste. But I do think that Biden needs every vote he can get, and I think he is the candidate with the best chance to beat shitbird 45.
Joe Biden Needed a Typed Script to Call Kamala Harris and Tell Her She’s the VP Pick  how sad is that 🎶🤣
keeps spewing the same lines about how Obama/Biden “spied” on his campaign in 2016. Donnie keeps putting focus on the fact that his staffers were handing over security information to a Russian handler, so the FBI was keeping tabs on them and the information.

Biden picked intelligent, black/Indian woman. 🤔 He must not have known that he already had my vote.

Joe Biden is a racist incompetent pedophile and Kamala Haiti’s is a greedy capitalist cop who would rather seen growing incarceration numbers and deny trans people health care than actually pretend she wants to fight for the demographic she wants to represent so much
Haha. What a bunch of fucking losers the Dems have become. This is hilarious. Rapist and his accusers' confidant. Fuck    obviously you have no self respect or dignity. Whatever it takes to become President...as JB is 102 yrs old.👍🏼
Joe Biden before he ran for Vice President in 2008 helped put 100,000 police officers on the streets across America . So don’t try to spin this this.

I think Biden/Harris just sealed it for Trump. I was wrong in 2016 and I could be wrong now. It’s a toss-up I guess.
Actually- I have repeatedly said any choice gets a pass. Because the choices are all terrible.  No vote shaming from me.   Write in Ventura? Fine. Vote Biden? Understandable.  Vote Trump? Heinous; but you do you. Vote Green? Cool  I've wished the Ds luck every day. #BestOfLuck
went further left into crazy radical-ville. There is no better election to will show the differences between the radical left and the conservative right. Freedom with  or imprisonment with Biden
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
When I heard Biden chose Harris the debate was the first thing that came to mind. Pence is going to need mother to hold him after Kamala is through with him.  Regardless what you think of her she is a total badass during hearings.
Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, spent career breaking barriers
A vote for Biden is a vote for Harris.
I agree.  A weak play from Biden.  But who else was there for him to loose with out there.
I don't trust Biden to not expand the airstrikes, but we're still militarily involved in all of those places, much to my dismay  Obama was still worse, but I'm still disappointed.
Reminding everyone of this gem of mine now that she’s Biden’s official Veep pick.
You fail to understand that a lot of people don't put 160K deaths on Trump  I really don't know what Biden would have done differently, and I haven't seen evidence that whatever that may be (Mask mandate) would have actually prevented the deaths  160K will be dead under Biden too
I don’t like Biden but I’ll chose him over Trump.
Biden isn't doing any of that.   He's alienating EVERY voting bloc.  Except donors &amp; apparatchik.  Donation data tells the tale.  Be glad he is in quarantine- or rally numbers would be painful. How are his state offices doing for volunteers?   Nah. #FeelTheMath
I love Biden uses a MacBook Air. Gets my vote  Then again I’d never vote for a fascist
The entire narrative about Biden being electable was laughable.   The right already has conservatives. They will (&amp; do) call the most far right D a "socialist".   That does cost votes. Right votes.   See the problem?
🤷🏾‍♂️   As a leftist, don’t care for her politics. I think she’s a good fit for Biden, but was hoping for Warren.  I am excited about Indian-American pols    who are much more progressive.  Some of my Indian-American friends are v excited, some feel like me.

This is one reason it may be more advantageous than ever for a candidate to have his entire cabinet picked/announced during the campaign... make the campaign Biden+Kamala/Rice/Pete/Inslee et al vs. Trump+jr/Ivanka/Jared.
Joe Biden thinks Kamala Harris is the best person to run the country come January 2021.   Yes, you read that right.
He wrote the crime bill. He wrote the federal asset forfeiture  - the Biden/Thurmond bill. He's always been to the right of Reagan on policing. He promised to INCREASE their budget during Defund protests.  He gains nothing from adding her. It ain't about him.
Turning out Biden and Tromp voters is a path toward your "goal".
Not literally Biden’s behalf but him as the proxy for any white male with power being questioned by a black woman (ie Trumps form of himpathy lol
Wow, #CreepyJoeBiden has managed to upset the also ran other old white man! Maybe #SleepyJoe thought he would steal  s  fan base. Still sounds as logical as ANYTHING Biden has said all year! #Trump2020Landslide #ProLife #1A #2A #WalkAway

Pence doesn't believe those accusations about Trump, but Harris does believe them about Biden.  There's a pretty clear difference.
So many people just jonesing for a conspiracy. The bevy of armchair politicos using the VP pick to justify their nutty fucking suspicions is wide. From “I knew it was her because of how Biden sat 8 weeks ago” to “Tulsi Gabbard made this happen”   I’m tired y’all
And what did Kamala do to Biden about the bussing? One gamble paid off and the other didn’t.   Listen it’s unethical but it’s the game they play.
Biden Harris is backed by tech moguls and Wall St because they will preserve China sell out of our jobs and preferable tax codes for Wall Street . Wooops.  She called him a sex abuser and racist.  BLM . Open borders . Free health care for illegals ! High taxes . Fewer jobs !
Once again Trump wants to cut taxes for the upper 5%. Raise their taxes Joe.
In this case, when he said, "sleep," Biden actually meant taking a nap.
He was rich before entering politics, unlike Biden and the rest of the DC swamp rats
The die is cast, Biden - Harris ticket.  If, Biden wins he will serve until age 90 then step aside due to poor Health and the Dems have what they want a female President.  This has been the plot all along.
It’s either you can make a terrible voting choice or the worst voting choice. No inbetween. We had some amazing people up on the debate stage... I don’t know how we got here. I don’t even know anyone who voted for Biden. Wtf
Biden is said to be pleased that his pick for VP is you know... That lady from that place.

Biden thinks picking a person by their skin color and sex organs qualifies her .   Biden won’t last a full term. Harris covered up evidence in LA and let an innocent man go to prison for life . Put thousands in jail for grass then smoked it at home.  Even seems stoned on TV
Biden could’ve picked Nikkki Haley as his veep (ew, I just threw up a little in my mouth) and she’d be labeled ‘far left’ by a whole host of “pundits”.
I think the vice presidents scope of power is whatever the president allows, and biden aint going to stop her from anything.

You are so intimidated by strong intelligent women. Kamala and Biden are going to eat your lunch! And then you're going to jail, fat boy!

Elect Trump to a 2nd term?  That's a paddling.  Elect a Biden-Harris ticket.  Oh, you better believe that's a paddling.
Here's why Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his VP
I consider all this not worth paying attention too. It is all a distraction from the other side or just click bait. We all were waiting and very FEW had any issue with any Biden pick.
Biden choosing a cop for his VP candidate is a clear sign that the Democratic Party DOES NOT and WILL NOT listen to its constituents.
I would cite Harris' own campaign website but since she was chosen as Biden's VP the site links to his. Instead, I'll give you a link to a Reason article:
Trump machine is lying about this.
is this biden and harris’ america? omg 😍
I've seen a lot on Twitter basically denouncing Bernie for the immediate Kamala Harris support.  They understand that Biden and Kamala are part of the history of the corrupt justice system they hate.  Those that do vote will be gritting their teeth the whole way through.
i have to vote for joe biden and kamala harris i hate it here 😭
Death team for President. Biden Harris. Abortion  infanticide. Coming soon:  one child policy  forced sterilization  forced vaccinations forced euthanasia.  Godless society.
Block anyone saying they won't vote Biden based on Harris. They are bots or trolls.
#2020Election will be a shit show.. which smell do you prefer?  #KamalaHarris #Biden #Trump #Warren #Bernie
So,  are you voting for Biden/Harris this November?
biden’s pick for VP just proves we are moving deeper and deeper into a fascist police state and that “the people” can never truly win when our options, both A and B, are 1) chosen for us(DNC BS) and 2) blur party lines to give us a false sense of our freedom to vote.
I remember the day after Trump was elected. I was disconsolate. Being in Oklahoma, I'm surrounded by people who voted for Trump. I complained to my friend and he said, "Now you know how I felt when Obama was elected."  Well, this guy just said he's voting for Biden this year. 😮
Someone would always be salty with WHOEVER Biden picked, but let’s not take away the moment of the first black woman tapped to be Vice President. American history.
The Biden/Harris tag-team is going to face a "Rocky-like" Champion of the World . . .  #BidenBlow2020  .
Well Biden didn’t  pick a woman who was black. Kind of reminds me of Warren when she pretended to be Indian
What will Tammy do? Remain a Senator? Or...??? But, I'm still voting Biden/Harris 2020. Good enough for me, I think.
Of course she did. She cares nothing. Nothing for America. She panders. She lusts  for power. She is an empty empty soul like the demented racist Biden. She accepts his racism as she knows she will be President.  In her sick sick mind.
Yesss! Biden-Harris 2020!!
No, Biden is shitty on some policies and same for Harris. Those policies might not affect you and that’s why u probably won’t care but others care since it affect their lives. We are in shitty situation to choose between two horrible choices
You better vote this year. It’s Trump or Biden.
I’m sure Joe Biden didn’t know who his VP pick was until his wife told him
What about Biden’s corruption. Pay to play. Biden should be in jail.
The only thing historical about the Biden Harris ticket is for the first time in the history of the United States we have two open communists on the dem ticket. If they win there goes our Constitution and our livelihood
China will be thrilled if Biden wins.  Even Pelosi acknowledged that.  Russia is a pathetic country with 1/10th the GDP of China.  They aren't a legitimate threat like establishment dems have been squawking about for 4 straight years.
I was partial to Biden/Bass. Sounds like crappy fishing tournament.
It makes sense when replying to someone saying that Russia will be happy if Trump is elected.  Pelosi even said China wants Biden.  Who is a bigger threat?  China or Russia?  I think it's pretty obvious.  (Still voting third party, anyways)
I’m a realist.  It’s either Trump or Biden.  Why are you complaining about a VP pick?  Go vote in November. You still will need Iyanla to fix your life if you don’t go plan and work for your dreams. No politician is going to make that happen regardless who wins!
Trump has done more for Criminal Reform than Harris or Biden
Biden &amp; Harris are both pro-Zionist.  Trump is mucking up things- not pushing the agenda forward.  Adelson pulling his $ makes perfect sense.  He's probably part of the Lincoln Project.
Biden Obama cages Hunter Ukraine family issues Willy Brown’s prostitute  Still doesn't make sense
Trump is a fascist. Biden is fascist-lite.  We could discuss degree, but . . .
I think I saw a Biden boat parade but I couldn't be sure. The river wasn't clear enough to see all the way to the bottom.
I’m not brainwashed. I’m a realist. It’s either Trump or Biden.   I take care of my family daily regardless who wins!!!
She's such a loser. Kamala will do anything for power, she came up from under desks, kept the innocent in Jail in fact she said Biden was racist. What happened  is Joe all of a sudden not racist? 🙄
idk why all of you are acting like we didn’t know from day 1 that biden was going to pick kamala as his vp
Biden and Kamela... idk man I’m not feeling that but it cant get any worse than this soooo
will you have Biden Harris yard signs? I need one. They're $25 on his website.
You complaining and the election is November 2020. You have Trump or Biden. All that hot air you typing work the next 4 years to fix after the election.

RIGHT ON!! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!🇺🇸⭐️🇺🇸⭐️🇺🇸
This election will be similar to 2016. Many people will vote Democrat due to “voting for the lesser of two evils”. I’ll begrudgingly vote for Biden mostly because we can’t afford another 4 years of the alternative
kind of hope you are, though i don't the ins/outs of warren/biden. i like warren a lot.
So when Joe Biden said you ain't black if you don't vote for him that's okay?  What about when Kamala Harris said that she believed Joe Biden's accusors, but now she's running as his VP, how's that right?
The 2nd Amendment is under no threat. I do pray however, that Biden &amp; Harris dismantle the

Oh my, Eric. Something tells me your daddy is scare of Biden's VP. Of course he is. Smart, strong, intelligent. She knows her stuff. I imagine your daddy is sweating it when she debates Pence. Look what she did to Barr during his confirmation hearing? She takes no prisoners.

Vote Biden/Harris  For you know  The Thing 2020
Seems a bit odd that Biden would select somebody with a pretty terrible record as a prosecutor especially considering how much attention/support BLM is getting
Damn Skippy!! I am thrilled! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!🇺🇸⭐️🇺🇸⭐️
FOR THE LAST TIME.  A VOTE FOR JORGENSEN IS A VOTE FOR JORGENSEN.  IT IS NOT A VOTE FOR TRUMP.  IT IS NOT A VOTE FOR BIDEN.  IT IS A VOTE FOR JORGENSEN.
Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris as His Running Mate: 'a Fearless Fighter'
Sorry, but I'm gonna be mad about Biden/Harris for a while.  Jorgensen/Cohen is the only option.
Yeah if he doesn't back out! The debate would be like watching lions eat Christians. She will destroy him. I don't think he will debate, his advisors have to be telling him not too. They (Biden/Harrris) didn't cheat thru college, life and politics, or on their spouses.
. announcing his pick on Twitter: “I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked  — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.”
Joe and Kamala hate each other and the entire left hates cops. Who’s the secret Trump operative in the Biden campaign 😭
AMEN!! I am crying for joy! BIDEN-HARRIS 2020!⭐️🇺🇸⭐️🇺🇸
I’m thrilled with Biden’s pick!!! I’m very excited!! We can’t let Trump get re-elected!! I want our Nation back!!
Trump instantly lashes out at Kamala Harris as Joe Biden announces her as VP pick ?
OH oh I want to be flooded too.  I am a conservative.  I will not vote for Trump.  I may not vote for Biden, dunno.  But I do know I will NOT vote for Trump
Or call Biden a racist
BIDEN AND HARRIS -2020
She brings 2 things, most valued by the retrograde neolibs:  1. Pandering to the base (man, white liberals are going nuts all over twitter right now!)  2. Assuming victory, a person with desirable optics who is guaranteed to carry on their obstruction after Biden.
Kasich has become a left wing weirdo supporting AOC &amp; Bernie in support of Biden.   Don’t listen to what he says anymore, his actions have set his political path right through Socialism
I will say that I'd be a LOT happier seeing a Jorgensen vs Hawkins election than a Trump v Biden election.  I stand with both the Green Party and the Libertarian Party in their mutual quests for ballot access
So Kamela doesn’t believe the woman who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault??
With Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs and open our borders. #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020

Amen. Leaving aside ideological matters - and I bet it won't even be 24 hours before we start seeing "I can't support her, she's a cop!" tweets from purer-than-thou progressives (and Russian bots) - and considered purely politically, Biden could not have made a better VP choice.
Joe Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate for 2020
Yeah, Kanye now gets to run against Biden and Harris's long history of promoting the persecution of unfair and shameful laws that caused irreparable damage to the black community.
They won't.  Trump will refuse to debate Biden in an empty forum space. Pence won't be on stage with a woman who can kick his a$$ with words and punches
Growing out my commie beard to vote in those known radical leftists Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Oh. Fuck the MAGA crowd.
And how did I forget to mention Joe Biden helped write the 94 crime bill which is considered to be the modern revitalization of slavery. This ticket is an absolute mess.
Joe Biden makes racist remarks on a monthly basis and Kamala Harris has arguably done more than any other potential candidate to ensure POC are locked away for lengthy sentences in prisons for minor offenses through systemic racism and corruption. That seems like a distaster.
The least Biden could’ve done was have Kamala as his running mate
Now can we please have tag team Presidential debates? Aside from Harris wrecking both Trump and Pence, Biden and Harris could watch each other's backs if Trump tries anything funny.
Let's go #Biden/Harris for the win.
Great day. Let's hope Nov. 3 is even better with Biden-Harris winning. #MakeAmericaGreater

Ladies and gentlemen, our new VP:
Will anyone address that Biden is a spineless trojan horse who didn't get to actually pick his VP?  If he did, he looks weak as hell after how she talked about him.  Biden is weak.  We need debates, and Trump needs to be in a laser-focus attack similar to 2016 Primaries

Maybe Kamal Harris figured out she was for Biden, and wasn't for trump, and that's what made her turn black?
NJ will be going for Biden Harris in a BIG way.
Your heart is huge &amp; Kamala is great! However, can a man/Biden w/ONLY 70% of his brain capacity REALLY lead the United States, as we explore new energies, fight new greed, hopefully gain immunity, continue to thwart China, keep Putin content, while educating ALL Americans? HONEST
I like brainless Biden
I support both you and Biden but, truth be told, we have had AT LEAST three and a half years to do those things and look where we’re at.
To start, a number of anonymously sourced quotes from Obama leaked out throughout the 2020 Biden campaign where the former president allegedly expressed doubts about his former running mates’ fitness for office.
Half the country would be unemployed in a Biden administration during a pandemic.
It sure does matter! At least Trump has done what he said he would. It’s not gonna affect SS. Unless all you watch is msnbc or cnn.  Biden has argued for cuts or freezes to SS for much of his 45 year career. What has he accomplished in all those years?
One of the worst run unions and organizations in America endorses Biden? Seems about right!
Cheaper to make there, hopefully the Chinese will prehack the machines to only vote Biden as revenge for the tariffs.
I mean you could argue most politicians are. Biden picking her IMO alienates his current radical base and fails to secure a sizable portion of mods playing the "law and order card" his party cant even denounce a terrorist group let alone prosecute rioters
After 51 Years in DC, If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
I'm pretty sure I remember just a few days ago Biden on his bike zooming past a Fox news reporter.
Trump does a horrific job uniting all races, creeds &amp; religions. He's a scientific dolt. Yet, from his trade bills to his Middle East peace acts, to his opiate crackdown at US ports of entry, to his strong stance on China, to having 100%ok-90% brain capacity, he "trumps" Biden!
Non issue.  Israel/UAE is a huge issue and HUGE win for Trump!  Biden/Obama wussed out, delayed any peace talks, and have the blood of dead US soldiers on their wimpy hands-when they gave Iran 150 billion!!!!
It’s what they want. They know Biden can’t win, so they want away to delegitmize and cast “doubt” on the election.
Biden / Harris the faces of what basic bitches look like hahaha
I just stay away from all news and most social media, the world they show on a 24 hr loop is not the world I see outside my window. This will all be over right after the election, Biden wins it will disappear by Jan.1, Trump wins they will find something new to be mad about
If you unironically support Biden/Harris then you are definitely not a leftist lol
Joe biden however did say he wanted to defund social security
Kinda like the USPS Union endorsing Biden ??   Nothing suspicious there, right?
I guess we listen to opisite news sources and therefore get the bias we want. All i know is I am hearing reporters ask people and those people are stating Biden will not change dates or add a 4th.
You could be right, but local organizers are fighting quite an uphill battle against the two-party power structure. The fact that we’ve had only two parties worth anything for many decades now shows what a difficult process that is. Again, not saying I’m going against Biden
However I have to i will vote for Biden on nov.3rd. Mail, personally delivered,  cast a ballot in person.  Vote blue 💙!
He just needs to shut up and bring back Fauci and Burke. Did he send them to Siberia? We NEED their expertise not his BS. Biden doesn’t support wacko Qanon cult members to get their votes.
Not saying I’m not voting Biden, but let’s say my dream is one day the US is de-polarized like Germany or one of many other Euro countries with a true DemSocialist party and many diverse parties with diverse interests. How do I get there by voting Dem in perpetuity?
0 cap detected. Saw someone call biden a fascist, socialist, liberals, communist unironically

Not true I couldn’t stand your ass but decided to vote for you because I saw Hillary as corrupt. Joe Biden doesn’t have that problem. I’m voting joe and I’ve never voted dem for President. #byeDon
You are missing the point. Biden is the biggest hypocrite in politics. 47 years proves this.
What like funding HBC’s and making sure it’s 10 years instead of begging every year? Or creating opportunity zones in minoritie neighborhoods? Or signing first step act that allowed a lot of young black men that Biden and Clinton’s crime bill put in prison out of prison?

Bingo and many I think are ignorant on purpose. Some ive talked too truly believe Obama/Biden left Trump with nothing to fight virus. They're dumb
I can’t wait until you and Biden are in the White House.
Once again, any attacks against him reduce his chances against Trump. I guess you'd rather have Trump as President?  If it were a less odious opponent, fine. But it's Trump. And yes, hurting Biden helps Trump.
I'm just going to quote this on every Joe Biden tweet from now until the election.
I love hearing Kamala Harris talk about the plan that Elizabeth Warren wrote for Joe Biden.
Dr West is voting for Biden... I’m almost guaranteed not to, but if people like Dr West will vote for him, you can’t say he’s a hypocrite. He understands harm reduction. I’m in a red state so I vote Green, but harm reduction exists. Vaush made a good video on this.

So why are the press not allowed to ask questions at the Harris/Biden events?
Def don’t think Biden has the charisma of say, an Obama or a Reagan or even Trump. Putting him out there like this feels like being served re-heated leftovers. I don’t think he has the ability or the desire to gain the same kind of religious devotion as is given to 44 and 45
oh yeah that is kamala harris’ proposal that you just sent i was referring to biden’s. not like any of this matters anyway biden’s ass ain’t gonna get elected 😂
To me it looks like a lot of the enthusiasm for Biden is wishful thinking, like “Well, let’s make the most of this and give him our full support,” gaslighting themselves until they believe he’s amazing, while a large chunk of Trump supporters seem to borderline worship him.
You look like a bot. Are you a bot?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

When will they get rid of Biden? Predictions? 👇🏽 who are they swapping him with?
Listen, Biden and Harris are not perfect. They have issues with their past that they will need to deal with and make changes, but to say that because they aren't perfect, you should sit one out and let the current President get re-elected? Go fuck yourself.  Vote his ass out.
That Biden, Kamala doc signing was infamous!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In no way, shape, or form do i think Biden is a good candidate but i think this is very misleading. His tax plan is actually fairly realistic IMO and are targeted at people making over $400,000 (the 1%). And I do support the increase of the capital gains tax.
I guess since Biden and Kamala have been putting away more blacks in prisons than ever before, BLM won’t be voting for them? If they have ANY common sense
This woman to all my Christian friends around the world SHE TORE THE BIBLE IN HALF and threw it on the floor!!!!!!  Anyone calling themselves a Christian that votes for her them. Biden was there!!!  Stated they don’t believe and Trumps family does!!!!!!!!
these are our choices. Absolutely fucking hate it. But we can survive a Biden presidency. We can elect other progressive candidates down the ballot. We can apply leftward pressure to Biden and still have a functioning country at the end. 4 more years of 45 will destroy us. (2/2)
What our President is trying to do is called Fascism. So whatever problems you have with the Biden/Harris candidacy shut your fucking mouth and vote against fascism!! #BidenHarris2020
Exactly this. A Biden/Harris ticket isn't perfect, and in fact there are def some legit concerns... but in the absence of a perfect candidate, I'd rather have the imperfect one that'll still at least push some liberal policies over the man who's actively trying to destroy America
If the democrats had any integrity, which they lack, they’d realize this disqualifies Joe Biden from being president by their own admission.
Vote for Biden/Harris cause we have more of a survival chance with them even if it’s still scary and with them we maybe will still have a victory 8 years down the road.
Raymond Arroyo: Is Kamala Harris Biden's shadow president?  via
I think the issue is that it ONLY resonates with people in the Fox News bubble. Joe Biden isn’t nearly as reviled by the general public as Hillary was. Calling Joe “far left” only works on those who would’ve never voted for him anyway.
Honestly, I would buy the rhetoric, but it failed last time. And paying more attention this time, the dnc will continue to do everything in its power to disenfranchise progressives. I can't not vote for Biden, but it's hard for me to be too upset with people that won't.
Watching my friends who grew up raving, are pro marijuana, and support BLM and defund the police now try to do mental gymnastics to justify supporting Biden and Harris makes me very sad. Just another example that logical consistency is dead in America.
THREADCEPTION  But no, seriously, there's some really important points made here and I'm guilty of doing it myself. I have legitimate concerns about some policies that a Biden/Harris ticket might advance... but they'd honestly still be far, far better than 4 more years of 45.
Mika supporting a proven racist and sexual predator in

Sadly yes. A vote for anyone other than Trump or Biden is a "wasted vote" &amp; would be viewed as "helping Trump".
Their polls also show Biden leading President Trump.
We just had a poll showing Biden +3. Somebody is *wrong* by a lot. My guess, this one.

Yep, this is one scenario/mindset I was worried about. I'd rather the nominees be Trump and Biden. I've dealt with Trump for 1,301 days. At this point, I can deal with him another 159. If he wins, then impeach him.
But that’s not a good thing to say. I get it. But it’s relinquishing your vote. It’s not holding anyone accountable. People should still be telling Biden he has to earn your vote.

She says it like it is! Biden is a racist from the deep states hold lies and hides in his basement
No.  The difference is that Trump doesn’t mind if you get rich, too.  Biden does.
She only spoke the truth to Biden when she said he was racist
Vote for Biden, Chef. But no lying about him or Kamala. That’s unacceptable.
Too many what ifs. I'd rather just see the election proceed as it is. That's just me though. Why spend energy on an impeachment when they could spend energy on getting Biden elected?

If you think Trump is doing anything on his own you aren't paying attention. So if he can have Pence/Kuchner/McEnany/Barr/Mnuchin/OAN/FOX there behind him propping him up, then it's perfectly acceptable for Kamala to land some punches if Biden is too classy for that.
LOL, Russia is behind the democrats.   3 1/2 years of investigations showed President Trump was not aligned with Rusdia.  But Clinton and Biden are.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks    Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at
Biden and Harris have to take the spot light of them being so radical left. But they're  not the answer to our problems. President Trump is best person to straighten out our problems. Biden and Harris is the problem. They're no good for our country. Pelosi doesn't  care about you
The photos and images posted of Joe Biden are not true he’s not a paedophile he lost his wife and a child Joe Biden hasn’t gotten over that but he’s actually a good man and a good father he doesn’t teach his children to be evil like Donald Trump and Kamala is good.
Huh. Just around the same time Biden is announcing it should be mandated?
Obama and Biden lost 12 million people in flu epidemic while they were in office. Everyone wants to blame President Trump for virus but not true people wouldn't follow directions that have put out so how can you blame our President? But they want to put the spot light on Trump.
Believers for Biden? Thats an oxymoron.  No shame. How can a believer support the most abortion rights ticket in history? And yet I know some who are supportive of Biden.  I'd be concerned about being asked about it at the judgment seat.
Dude all he does is answer loaded question after question after question. Your bitch biden answers none or has them already pre-determined who gets to ask. We all know why they wont answer, one biden cant formulate a coherent sentence, two they would have to address their lies
george if you give me $20,000 i will stop saying i don’t like biden and harris
Older voters must’ve wanted Biden because they trusted him when with Obama. Idk lol I’m not in that demographic group 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
Obama/Biden did such a "good job" we decided to elect a civilian business man instead of a politician.
Because we care about incarceration, that's why we presented Biden and Harris.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’
we want a progressive candidate  the DNC and joe biden:
The left, living in fantasy world, will coo themselves to sleep at night with these posts. According to the commie Dems, Biden and Harris will win, so why worry about impeaching the president?
I’m fully aware what dense means. LA, Boston, Detroit, all densely populated cities with nowhere close to the failure rate of Cuomo. Biden lied his way into politics by claiming he had 2 more degrees than he had and said he was top of the class when he was bottom 25%. They all do
That means 11 million illegal immigrants computing for american jobs. Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks will be eligible for free healthcare, social security and medicare. WE CAN'T AFFORD JOE BIDEN. WE NEED TO RELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP. He will make America great again.
Joe Biden is still tweeting too.
Joe Biden has dementia but still remembers to hate black people
Biden says if you elect me your taxes are gonna be raised not cut. That means middle  class families, small business, and seniors will pay higher taxes. Biggest tax increase in history 4 trillion dollars. Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.
Kamala and Biden. Welcome to George Orwells 1984 dustopian nightmare
Nope we will be respected again.  We the people will sleep Easy knowing Biden won’t start war in the middle of the night
No matter what you do to the #postoffice I am voting for Biden.
I get that Biden and Harris weren't your first choice. Probably not even your second choice. But if you think there's no difference between them and Trump?
You can’t honestly believe that? No amount of fraud can propel Biden to a win.
Hillary’s margin never was this big! I can tell you don’t have a statistics background nor had one class on it ! Bozos are everywhere in the Q family .. We shall see.. We shall see. Biden has always been loved like Obama! Trump is going lose. Mark my words .. R are leaving Trump
Harris, like Biden, has history of making questionable comments via
Dan Gainor: Biden keeps hidin’ from tough questioning by reporters, as anti-Trump media go easy on him        Well Said!! HIDIN BIDEN!
There truly is an absolute lack of enthusiasm with Biden - The hope that anti-Trump sentiment will drive the vote, seems to be the angle.
I think if Biden gets elected he’ll likely step down early and make Kamala president.
and this is why anyone is voting DEM is really voting for Harris because I doubt hardly anyone would put money that Biden could make it 4 years
Black Lives Matters &amp; the rest of us want equality in this country why didn't this country's first black president do something to fix racism? Why did Obama pick Biden for his VP? Biden has friends that are members of the KKK and voted to block equality bills. Biden is a racist.
Biden/Harris are for heavy regulation (for climate change), wealth redistribution (heavy taxation aka "economic justice"), globalization (trade agreements that send jobs overseas), continued class warfare, and bailouts for Democratic Party controlled states.
Biden/Harris have been in government for 30+ years. They are part of THE SWAMP. Both of them have enjoyed political power, opulence, and the status their position has given them. During Harris' 30 years public service, and Biden's 44+ years, what actually improved?
We're sorry to hear you've  canceled your subscription, but we had a story about Biden and Harris on page A7 in our national news section:
You can either believe the politicians or you do the research. Ask yourself what did Obama/Biden do for you &amp; what has Trump/Pence done for you? Biden has had 51 years in politics what has he done in all those years that has improved your life?
Unemployment rate in Dec 2015 (Obama/Biden) - 3.5 unemployment rate in Dec 2019 (Trump/Pence) - 5.0 Dow Jones in 2015 - 17,587.03 Dow Jones in 2019 - 28,538.44 GDP in 2015 - 3.9 GDP in 2019 - 4.1 Either Kamala Harris doesn't know how to measure the economy or she is lying.
Hahahahaha! Biden is ahead while staying in Delaware ! I don’t your naïveté to over 160,000 deaths.
They've posted 45 &amp; covid, VP Biden and Sen. Harris, but no Tiffany Cross on YouTube.
The only real argument for voting for the Biden/Harris ticket is as grudging, nose holding anti Trump vote because it is more important to get rid of Trump than anything.
Two corporate Democrats with absolutely trash voting records....remind me of 2016. The DNC has told  progressives that they don't need our vote and they never plan on giving us meaningful policy concessions. Biden is against M4A during a pandemic. Trash ticket.
Biden had 50 years to fix America and now wants to complain
Like, Obama and Biden did a great job with the recession we were dealt with and got us out of the gutter. Trump enabled business expansive policies to keep our economy rolling and expanding where it could have easily contracted. Both can be true
are you inciting your cult to do something to Biden? You are one evil woman. Karma will get you.
In my personal opinion, Biden is the better option. But that doesn’t mean he’s not dirty, let’s not treat him like a savior because he’s no where close to perfect.   We’re still screwed no matter what... 🤷🏻‍♂️
I don’t think Biden’s candidacy is as nuts as someone rising from the grave and logging onto Twitter dot com.
Get used to it. This may be the nicest anti Biden Trump ad
If Biden can do it, why not Herman Cain?
Eeks!!! I know Biden is!
I can't believe that some people say that making them wear a mask violates their rights. My question is if it stop the virus then why not? People need to work together regardless. Let's all be safe together. The Biden and Harris will violate your rights!!! Is that what you want?
328 million citizens in the “greatest” country in the world and the best we can do:  Trump v. Biden
Yeah, "just right for Biden" is part of the issue here. They'll be holding hands and skipping while beating black parents over the head and jailing them for truancy.
Fine. She sounds like Marge Simpson. I don't care if she sounds like Bobcat Goldthwait. She's intelligent and she'll get the job done. That's why Biden/Harris is the ticket for which I'm voting.
Yeah, BERNIE is gonna vote for Biden. He didn’t tell anyone else to do that.
Joe Biden is suffering with DEMENTIA so bad he doesn’t even know what State he is in!! However he knows he likes little kids to feel his leg hair, and he touches and kisses every female he comes in contact with, his favs are the 12 and younger grope ah group!
Your right both Barry and Biden have lied for years about it!
Blah blah blah! You Trump suckers are shaking in your boots. She’s a winner and she’s coming after your loser! Biden/Harris 2020!
Bring honesty, class, compassion, and dignity back to the White House!  Vote #BidenHarris
Shouldn't Biden do that?
Maybe Hunter Biden is hiding in Kamala Harris basement 😂😂😂
Not even the pope will help Biden get elected.
Someone is afraid the man Biden can’t debate. We all know Biden is an idiot
I'm not voting for kanye. I was left with no choice in this matter and yes Biden was and is an idiot but at least he's 100% better than that nazi monster.
Hopefully not from the same place as the innocent people she blocked DNA testing against so she could keep her conviction rate up. I’m no trump fan but in the debates, trump will embarrass Biden and Pence will call out her keeping innocent black people in prison
Don’t get on my page slamming Joe Biden anymore because I will block you I’m pissed at Donald Trump he can go fuck hisself I need to be taken care of and every person in my predicament needed to be taken care of he failed me and thousands of others in the United States I’m done
Watch Biden during Thomas’ Confirmation Hearings. Pays Hill to lie, then dumps on her! Dems are a crock of snakes - always have been!
Giuliani has been quiet for so long you know he's up to no good, doing tRumps bidding. And, yes, they've probably found some miniscule issue with Biden that they've created &amp; manipulated into some great HOAX to defame his character &amp; integrity.   WE THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE BAITED.
Herman Cain upon hearing Biden's VP pick:
I have literally hated Biden after what he pulled at the Confirmation Hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas. He dug up Anita Hill then dumped on her as well.  A loud-mouth, liar, thief. One term would have been one term too many! Shameful!
Biden and Harris will not be the  best thing for our country just the opposite. If you want to lose your freedom and be controlled by government you will not like what happens. I hope people will wake up before it to late. Our country survival depends on it. That's a fact.
Kamala Harris will be the one in charge not Biden. We will lose our freedom and everything will be control by the government. Do you really want the most dishonest two people running  our country? God help our country and the people. This country will be no more!!!
Fuck Joe Biden
Man,  has their "spin team" working overtime tonight. You're gonna have to do better than this to make America forget what a joke the Biden campaign is.

To be fair, Bernie didn’t actually tell anyone to vote for Biden if you actually read the article and also watch the video. He says “vote early and vote down the ballot, vote because it matters” or something similar.

Biden/Harris 2020!!! America has had enough of trump and pence!! I know when the lord is sending us a signal!
Kamala is a horrible choice-if the goal is to garner 4 million more black votes-as she IS NOT a black voters black person.  Her DA record proves she's anti-black!!!!  Should scrap both Bedridden Biden and Harris; change ticket to Kennedy III/Abrams!!!
Biden should’ve picked Michelle 🥺
Why aren’t we hearing more about Comey, Clinton, Biden(Ukraine) no one cares about Kamala Devils! We all Know she is evil and  allows babies to be killed ( probably has designer shoes and purses made out of them)
Biden is in the White House for 4-8 years, another Trump Supreme Court pick will be on the bench for 30+. What is so hard to figure out about this. You will NEVER get MFA if we have a conservative majority Supreme Court.
Biden doesn’t know here from there. If anyone thinks he’s really gonna be the man pulling the strings if he gets elected they have no idea. Someone else is gonna be telling him everything to say as do. He’s just a puppet.
To be fair, Biden made up his mind about having a black woman as a running mate before any other qualification. He’s supposed to be a leader. So we hold regular Joes to a higher standard than a presidential candidate?
Biden/Harris of course!
Trumpturd and Mikey have nothing for Biden and Harris.

Just to read "pool report" regarding Biden is SO refreshing!!!!
What in the world? This was clearly not written by Joe Biden.
Biden’s biggest supporter
Kamala Harris Fact of the Day:  Should the Biden-Harris ticket prevail, Kamala, 5’ 2”, would measure as the shortest Vice President ever (by 4 inches).  Shortest VPOTUS 5’ 6” Aaron Burr &amp; Martin Van Boren  Shortest POTUS 5’ 4” James Madison
I'm down to 1  ,,,  My dad  and in our last conversation, he asked if 'not voting Biden is a problem'  *headdesk
So is this how politics work now? Kamala says she believes Biden’s accusers just a few months ago.... and now we ignore all of that because it was just something you say to win? I hate it all. We need better choices.
So what will you be calling Joe Biden? He used the exact same pronunciation that Tucker did.  Or are you a total hypocrite?   And in case you missed it, Tucker was mocking the stridency of the critique, so if you don't take Biden to task with the same vehemency, hypocrite it is.
Biden really said “Man, people don’t want to vote for me? Watch this drive” and shit himself in the foot with his VP choice pushing even more people away from voting for him 🥴🥴
It turns out that  pronounced Kamala EXACTLY THE SAME as Joe Biden did. Now are you going to go off on Joe with the same vehemence. I doubt it. Hypocrite.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
I don’t think Joe Biden will last 4 months in office, before he’s sent to happy acres!

Gasses citizens? Boy talk about lacking context.  You're completely blind to the absurdities of Biden and Harris. Trump isn't close to being a dictator.
I don't understand how you can't see the problems with Biden and Harris. Are you just blind to the problems they have?
Weekend at Bernie’s is in for a longer run than Biden
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

Joe Biden mispronounced his VP's name. Boy this guy's a winner. Come on man!
Yea I know!! Me neither too! There are theories that biden intends to step down if he is elected to allow Harris to take over.
If Trump  is re-elected he is going disassemble Social Security in January of 2021. Why would you do this? Are you insane? Your a lunatic &amp; the people need to vote this Narcissist out of office. So he can’t tell any more lies. VP Biden  help us. Please.
Joe Biden couldn’t come up with the stream if he had to
That website literally just trashes the green new deal, while trying to pretend that Biden has proposed something that's the same thing.

Get a Biden-Harris flag.
Has he been hired to work on Biden's campaign now? Crazy state of things!
Really? Biden is Catholic in name only.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti Catholic VP pick.  I am not impressed by this AD.
Biden doesn't say anything because his handlers don't want him to accidentally say the opposite of what's on the cue cards.

I’m not voting for Joe Biden
i was only clarifying for those who are not energy players. who routinely heard biden and now trump take credit. love the cartoon!
That’s promising. Saw one sign of Joe Biden during the Primaries in West Texas
That is so true...   V.P. Biden this is who we want replaced in November! A lying buffoon, who is a narcissist &amp; lunatic. Help our country.
Neither did Stalin or Hitler. She is a known Socialist. Sooo is Biden have the same Socialist values?!!!
Are u insane? Kamala Harris repeatedly went to great lengths to BLOCK DNA testing on innocent people just to keep her conviction rate up. She went after Biden for sexual assault allegations... now you’re going to vote for them? Makes sense
Graham is deep state and running the clock hoping for a Biden victory
Hey Eric how about when she kept a innocent man in jail by knowingly witholding evidence that would free him. R his constiuency ready death camps. With Biden that’s next because his running mate is a KNOWN Socialist!!!
Wonder why Biden and affiliates are supporting Trump???? Weird but they can keep their support. #Trump2020
Nope. Hasn't been catholic in a long time. Just look at his voting record. If you are Catholic and you think Biden is please seek help. Talk to your spiritual director.
The DNC invited Kasich, did not invite Julián, and only gave AOC 60 seconds to speak. This is not the time to piss off an entire wing of your own party that you need to win down ballot races. Of course I’ll vote for Biden but gah dammit we deserve better!

True. I’m not a trump supporter but Biden was the Vice President for 8 years. If he knew how to fix things, why didn’t he tell Obama?
Just heard Biden just raised a record breaking 30 million....🤔 this and the BLM funding ActBlue which is basically the Democrats.... well let’s just say it’s clear the Democrats are funded by more then one terrorist organization ... 🤬
How Biden rode into VP Office on the coattail of Obama is suspect - he didn’t lend a thing to the campaign. He was disliked by his party!  Perhaps he learned Blackmailing #101 skills from the Clintons and will pass them on to his VEEP choice, as if the bitch needs advice on vice!
always appreciate your viewpoint. Concerning Biden as a baby boomer, he was born in 1942, one of the late Silent Generation. Boomers started the next year. Biden would be the first of his generation to be elected President, the only one never to elect a Pres.
Biden, Harris to make unusual campaign debut in virus era
Did theybsay anything yet about Biden doing the same.
I don’t want to hear what you think about Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I think she’s a great choice. At this point, I would vote for Biden if Steven Seagal was his running mate.
These Biden/Trump debates are going to look like two old men argueing over what channel to watch in a nursing home.
Actually, by not voting for Trump I’m helping Biden get elected
The reason for it is Brets boy Biden and bidens ho had some kinda train wreck confrence or whatever and bret leaked his biden underwear ready to talk about how much biden means to him and blah blah blah. Bret just needs to come out and say it he os riden with biden
I am so excited for the combination of Biden/Harris to make America great again!
Biden’s Cognative Decline™️ is really something to see.
Not for me! I will never ever have those thieves and liars for my POTUS! HOW EMBARRASSING CAN THOSE TWO BE? BIDEN HARRIS &amp; JOKE FOR 2.

Joe Biden wants to make this law if he wins. No thanks. He cannot be allowed to win. It will destroy whatever small businesses are still around assuming we aren't forced into another economy killing lockdown.
I found it fascinating that 6 months ago she implied that Biden was a racist and a sexual predator and now she’s his running mate. I also thought that using his dead son to make points was really tacky.
Democrat October Surprise: Biden suffers medical calamity.  Harris picks Hillary as running mate.
The U.S. is in the middle of a perfect storm: COVID-19, murders, the fight for civil rights and justice, birthing the era of the BLM movement with the greater plague-the Trump Admin. All of this: Still, we will rise; we will recover. A strategic God w/Biden &amp; Harris leading US.
Biden/Harris ROASTED trump and VP Penis.
Yes, I was watching that Harris speech on Fox, bc the late afternoon on Fox News is my favorite cable news. Not as much since Sheppard got ousted, but still. Chris Wallace &amp; Neil Cavuto were on before they went to the Biden announcement
Oh no. Heaven help us. &lt;reaches for voting lever&gt; That would be terrible. Please save me. &lt;throws handle for Biden and Harris so hard the resultant devastation can be seen fromnspace&gt;
The facial expression from Biden makes it evident that he is so damn proud of his VP choice.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we journey down the road to recovery. It will take time but we will get there; we will recover.

My two cents... Biden/Heiress 20 is joke..how the hell does they not say anything about condemning the  riots,rioters? It’s their followers burning down the cities!!!  wins in a landslide over these two communists
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we are on the road to healing. It will take time but we will get there; we will heal.

Hes not my first choice either but I'm ridin with Biden now.  Blue down the ticket.

Could I ask you why you think voting for Biden is a more logical alternative than voting for Jo?
LOL, he won't have to try that hard to show Biden's racism, Biden does a good job of that by himself.
if you have a t-shirt for your campaign, get someone or several down to the high school wgere Biden is rolling out with Kamala. That man Lee Murphy has a lady standing in the camera shot with his website  pretty tacky on JOE'S rollout, but it's
Joe Biden couldn't tell you what the Second Amendment is without reading off a teleprompter, and even then he would still probably fumble his words
Joe Biden heard ya.
Lmao on this post.  Do you see the shape basement Biden is in?  He can’t even talk.  Good luck
Biden is Catholic!
Not going to lie and say it's my first choice. But in 2020, expectations/reality aren't the same. I will vote for Biden&amp;Harris, and I will push others to do the same. Not because I'm a #1 fan, but because other people deserve basic liberties. My selfishness doesn't come first.
That's one reason why I'm voting for Biden.
For those refusing to vote because a Biden/Harris ticket wasn't your first choice, just remember that there are others  voting because their life depends on it. So if you value "progress" more than human life, do us all a favor and STFU if trump wins again while you did nothing.
This is EXACTLY how I feel. Sick about it, but I will cast my vote for Biden/Harris
Imagine thinking a Biden/Harris ticket represents the “radical left” lol
Do you know what time the Biden/Harris  event is? I need to run to my doctor for a Med but don’t wanna miss it
No one wants bobble head VP Penis except for VP Penis wife.
So Trump seems completely blown away that Biden chose a candidate who might outshine him. He seems to think that the main criteria for a V.P. is someone who will hide behind your shadow and prop you up and kiss your ass when necessary.  Mike Pence totally agreed.
Joe Biden will either be unfit and Harris will step in as president. And polosi would be vp. This is there plan.
Biden - Harris = pro-abortion, both have a deep history of poor performance on prison and judicial reform, both favor pushing the democratic party further left.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Okay so I saw this being tossed around yesterday. Is it legal for Biden to announce his cabinet before winning the election? Some said "yay" with others saying "nay"?
Trump is a total idiot.  Biden is in a coma state.  I'll take idiot over incompetent anyday.....work with a few situations like this at my 2 Oklahoma Universities, too
can’t wait for them to lose and liberals to blame it on Biden-Harris being “too progressive”  Why the DNC is only going after “moderate voters” instead of activating what should be their base is beyond me.
I'm part of a National Coaching Coalition and have maybe 70,000 black friends- who ALL KNOW that Kamala Harris is 'WHITE"!  Sorry, but she would have been a good VP choice in 2024 with Joe Kennedy III, but now she's sunk with Biden
The college kids voting for Biden are gonna be like, fuck yeah I’m dumb as fuck. Guilty as simp.
She endorsed Biden. Months ago.
Jamaican-Asian-American to be accurate. But she's still not VP material and Biden isn't competent enough to be Prez either. Killary's already had her 2 terms (we all know she was Prez when Slick Willie had the title).
Is that why we have to choose between Biden and trump?
Also do you believe Joe Biden is still alive?
I just think it’s fucked up as a woman to live in a country where you worry about the safety of Kamala Harris working with Joe Biden
Whites have no chance garnering enough votes to elect Biden/Harris. And, as Kamala IS NOT A BLACK PERSON'S BLACK, black voters will NOT waste time to even vote.  I have sent this to over 1 million eligible black voters in 1 day/will send to 20 million more

Shes moderate left. Aint nothing radical about the possible Biden Administration.
That's not Joe Biden.
The Biden campaign has said it plans a rollout that blends the historic nature of Harris' selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation's circumstances.
Also, does 45 have to send his personal army to your city again to remind you of the existential threat that he is!? You guys sound ignorant trying to find reasons to not vote for Biden/Harris. I swear, uninformed, fake woke people are the worst. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Waiting for Biden to announce VP...
The only person for which this conservative wouldn't pull the Biden lever. Guess I'll just vote no on all the taxes, and nobody for prez
BBC News - Kamala Harris VP pick: How she could help - or hurt - Joe Biden
Oklahoma.   No worries here.  Biden will, guaranteed, go 0-77 counties.
Ok man, if you think that Biden has a sudden change of heart in the last four years and isn’t just committed to the same neoliberal garbage that he always has been then that’s no skin off my nose
President Trump said Joe Biden running mate Kamala Harris was "nasty" and "disrespectful" to Biden, offering his first reaction to Biden's pick of Harris.
If Biden was serious he’d pack the court, but he won’t 4. Again, doubt it 5. ACA is garbage anyways, M4A is the only viable healthcare plan and Biden isn’t touching it with a 10 foot pole 6. Doubt it 7. He has attempted several times over his career to slash SS
It's so fascinating how extreme everyone's take is on Kamala Harris.  Either Biden doomed us all, or she's our gallant savior come to slay the white male dragons of the established GOP order.  I do see the confusion
And Joe Biden still doesn’t know what state he’s in
Shows what kind of "Catholic " Biden is.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti-Catholic VP pick.
But getting rid of Trump is utterly pointless if we’re replacing him with Joe fucking Biden. It’s useless. It doesn’t matter.
and Joe Biden every step of the way if they are elected. We must fight against this liberal insanity, reelect  and replace Kendra Horn with a conservative voice for the 5th district.
It should come as no surprise that the swamp has selected socialist Democrat Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate. She supports gun confiscation, free health care for illegals, and radical environmentalist policies.  Make no mistake, Kendra Horn will stand with Kamala Harris
Neither Biden nor Kamala was my first pick, but I’ll take them over Cheeto Face any day
Biden’s gun tax policy is a joke and unfairly targets poor gun owners.
The meddling Barack the Great has saddled us with this hideous creature, Kamala Biden, the worst ticket in history.  #Deport  Wait until you hear her laugh. That's when the love really flows.
People think I’m defending Trump , I’m not. I dislyKalama, Biden and Trump all for different reasons
Republican attack ads make Joe Biden sound so much cooler than he actually is.
But Biden isn’t going to do anything to roll back any of Trump’s shit, and he’s just gonna be a repeat of the Obama presidency and give us someone even worse than Trump after. Biden doesn’t offer a viable alternative to Trump. This election is pointless
I get it. A vote for Biden means one vote less for Trump. I do not want another 4 years under a Trump Presidency. But you CANNOT ignore what these politicians are doing just because they aren't Trump
I am a suburban housewife &amp; I will not be voting for a racist buffoon &amp; narcissist that you are. It is time for a real man like Joe Biden   step into the office of President &amp;  Kamala Harris  along at his side!  That will make America great again!  NOT YOU!
I'm optimistic actually. Biden is personally pretty moderate, but his platform will be the most progressive in American history.  More than anything, I'm looking forward to having a cabinet of people who are even vaguely qualified.
Not going to happen...Biden is not much better than Hillary and we all know what happened there 🤷🏻‍♂️
biden/harris tech team covering all of their bases. was poking around and found that  redirects appropriately, lol
#nastywoman will vote Biden/Harris 2020
Ok Boomer. I'll vote. View Trump however you want. I don't like him. But one shouldn't ignore Biden's absurdities.
We All Look Forward To Pedo Joe being our “Commander and Chief” I’m Joe Biden and I’m Running for President of the Republic of China! Where’s that kid I was sniffing???
I’m seeing a lot of Trumpies attacking progressives for supporting Biden/Harris now when they didnt in the primaries. I think the main difference is that we’re voting for someone terrible bc we have to, they’re voting for someone terrible bc he’s exactly what they want.
Hey Chip, what happened to the Biden accusers that Camilla Harris believed
If biden and harris are radical socialists trunp and pence are the antichrist and Hitler. #TwoCanPlayThatGame
Biden was a part of the Obama administration.  So, in reality, Biden HAS put them in cages   Also you should research his VP pick, as far as putting people in cages.  Congratulations, i wasted about a minute writing this in response to an obvious bot account
My thoughts...I don't want 4 more years of Trump. He could have named anyone vice president and I wouldn't notice. Still voting for Biden.
She’s not my first choice either but I’ll take her and Biden any day over trump. No one candidate is perfect, they all come with baggage but trump’s  baggage is on a whole other level. We can’t afford 4 more years of trump, literally and figuratively.
Chomsky is still on board with voting for Biden after he chose Harris as his VP
Is Harold also Biden’s son? Follow the money. Hunter and Harold should both be in jail
oh well im not voting because biden sucks just as bad as Trump does
You quiet AF About that charity thing huh? Y’all bring up Hunter Biden religiously but can’t seem to muster up Trumps son stealing money from kids with cancer. Weird.
1)What’s your definition of “suburban housewife”? 2)This suburban housewife didn’t vote Trump in 2016 &amp; will #VoteBidenHarris2020 3)I will feel safe once you’re out of WH 4)I ❤️diversity 5)I hope Corey Booker is involved in Biden’s administration.
Criticizing Kamala’s policy don’t make you anti black or anti woman. Same way I get off criticism for Trump, Biden, Obama etc she gon get it too.
Bold of you to assume Biden cares about kids in cages
Joe Biden isn’t going in the direction I want
Excuse me Bishop! Biden is a long time devoted catholic, his faith is everything! You sir might want to re read your bible, cause Trump ain’t cutting it
8 years of Obama/Biden and not a single Democrat came for a single gun anywhere. Go clean your own house first.
Does this mean that Biden is less racist / sexist than the guy who picked him to be his VP?
She’s publicly slandered Biden on many occasions and believes his accusers lol😂😂
If the Election War game they ran tells us anything, they’re going to protest the election results, Biden I’ll step down and the electors will try to give it to Kamala.  They’ll hold an inauguration in California and try to see what the Military does
If the country belongs to all of us, does that mean you and Biden will change these outdated, barbaric man made laws? Freedom is what the people want. We want to self determine and not be told what to do or how to live our lives. We want to be able to live in #Peace
The soul of this nation has been tried and found guilty of its transgressions. Every individual soul desires to be free. Can you or Biden free the people? All Power to the People!! #BlackPantherParty #endpoliceharassment #DefundThePolice #ChangeTheLaws #Peace #Allahuakhbar
Joe Biden is no saint he’s the reason why we working towards prison reform now. Keep that in mind!
If you don't think that Obama and Soros are the puppet masters here you are crazy! I'm sure Hillary is ready to pounce and join the ticket should Biden unravel or worse before November.
To all of the resistors out there who unfollowed me because of my insistence that Joe Biden pick a woman of color as his running mate I only have three things to say  1. You are racist. 2. Fuck you. 3. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  #JoeBiden2020
He’s defending Biden for being friends with the Klan
Oh Liz we are going to give her and Biden a chance...about 4 years worth of chances.

When the alternative is someone who is a complete anathema to progressive values in an authoritarian right wing nationalist like Trump I imagine these people will hold their nose to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket regardless.

Trump is so appalling though that many of these people will hold their nose and vote for Biden and Harris anyway because the priority is to get rid of Trump.
She prosecuted the black and brown people that Biden’s law targeted. Very easy choice for him.
Why is Biden Harris 2020 account suspended?
Seeing a lot of people saying they’re not voting bc of the dem. candidate. If Biden is the democratic candidate then vote Biden! Don’t get to thinking your vote doesn’t count bc a nonexistent vote from you is a vote for trump.
Joe Biden has been nothing but spend his life getting rich off the American people he has accomplished absolutely nothing even if he had his mental stability is too far gone now
General. This whole movement started with police brutality. Then dementia ridden biden thinks its a great ides to make his vp a former cop. Peopke have a right to be outraged and say fuck the
The “Biden should have picked Tulsi” crowd might be the funniest three people on Twitter.
So were all in agreement right? Biden just betrayed the ENTIRE leftist movement and what we stood for? Were all agreed were saying fuck biden vote 3rd part and burn everything to the ground?
Reps were winning based on being tough on crime, to compete Dems had to become tough on crime. If crime wasn’t a problem already, the argument wouldn’t have been necessary. But miss me with the argument Biden put folks in prison, no criminals put themselves in prison. 1 of 100.
Biden chose a cop ad VP when all this shit started with cop brutality. Burn this goddamn system to the ground
I was going to vote biden cause we dont have the numbers for third party but this whole thing started with police brutality. Im not about to let a former cop whos known for high non violent incarceration become VP. Burn this fucker to the ground
That's about as big of a surprise as Joe Biden sniffing an 8 year old's hair.
Kamala Harris has done more to hurt People of Color since Joe Biden helped write the 1994 Crime Bill  Good thing they’re not on the same ticket...oh wait #VoteGold
#GeriatricJoe Biden as predicted picks black female senator as VP running mate. 2nd prediction: #GeriatricJoe when elected will shortly become unfit &amp; stand down in favour of said VP giving Democrats the first woman #POTUS &amp; the first BLACK woman #POTUS #transparent #woke #left
NEW: FiveThirtyEight data released this morning shows Biden favored to win the election. They simulated the election 40,000 times.
I walk a bit of a line here because I am a lefty by inclination and a pragmatist strategically; I don't like the Biden/Harris ticket, I think it is very far from where we need to be as a country, but the struggle to move us to the left is a cultural struggle first and foremost.
I told my husband it feels much like when Barack chose Joe Biden. A lot hope!!
Maybe Biden and Kampala can debate now. 😂
I don't have a party. And its messiah sure as hell isn't Joe Biden (Bernie Sanders, if anyone).   Ease back some there, edgelord.
I am voting early. Why wait til November? Vote Biden in ASAP!
When even Noam Chomsky is imploring people to vote for Biden...
Biden vs Trump better happen though. God owes us.
was forced to pick  for his VP by 100 ANGRY BLACK MEN! They sent Biden a letter threatening him if he did not pick a BLACK WOMAN for his VP he would lose all the BLACK VOTES.  is a COWARD! He can't think or do anything on his own!
Biden has spent more time telling people to not vote for him when they ask him what the holy fuck his actual platform is beyond “I’m not Trump” than he has spent actually coming up with a fucking platform. You are not owed votes.
He has an entire website where you can read it. But that isn't the point. We express it in terms of Trump to impress upon thick-headed individuals the criticality of backing Biden even if his politics/platforms aren't 100% what you want. Trump is indeed that much of a threat.
Okay. But Trump or Biden will be President. Must be nice to be in a good enough position to have the luxury of not caring which wins.
The debates are going to be hilarious. Biden will get asked the really tough questions, like what state he’s in and he won’t have a clue 🤣🤣🤣
Look at the bright side, Biden has been in politics for over 30 years and he doesn’t even know it 🤣🤣🤣
My opinion is Biden was forced to pick Harris by 100 BLACK ANGRY MEN they sent a letter to Biden threatening to take all BLACK votes from him. They also know that Biden won't live long enough so Harris will become president. VERY SCARY TIMES NOW!
Sheehan has a pretty brilliant analysis here, of Biden/Harris from a couple of weeks ago, reversing the DNC lurch to the right, how AOC will become a threat from the Left for 2024, and passing a Green New Deal. He thinks Obama should be Sec. of State.
Uhhh George I usually love you but WTF, Medicare for all and Green New Deal are NOT supported by the Biden ticket...
An ANT could pick Joe Biden up!
So you’re not going to vote for Joe Biden, the practicing Catholic; but rather the thrice married (who cheated on each spouse and then married the friend of Maxwell, currently in custody for sex trafficking) and who can’t recall a scripture. How “Christian” of you. You’re a fake.
Join me in supporting Biden Victory Fund via
Sadly at this point not voting for Biden is as bad as voting for Trump because you know his supporters will be out in force.
Trump/Pence 2020 it won't even be close. Trump hits 270 b4 biden hits 200.
You calling Biden dumb is like Einstein calling you smart.
I think a lot of us are just real uncomfortable about her history as a cop &amp; prosecutor. A lot to unpack with her ... it's a conversation we all need to have. But, in the meantime? Hands down, she and Biden aren't Trump, and that's enough for me. We can address the rest later.
Biden/Harris 2020 I predicted it would B  simply because she was clearly the strongest, most experienced, female candidate!
Biden has forgotten more than Harris will ever know 🤦🏻‍♂️
Calling a bad president a dictator doesn’t help your case.. it just, per usual, makes you look stupid.  Joe biden is infinitely worse than trump in comparison lmao. Trump is just the media villain when biden is the actual villian. Stop regurgitating shit
Are.. are there really people that would vote for Biden?
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Because i don’t like biden that means i want trump? Don’t be stupid lmao
It's no wonder democrats don't remember that they are the party of racism, hell they don't remember what Kamala said about Biden a few months ago!
According to the Kamal, Biden is both!
This election and all US elections ended in 2016 when Authoritarianism won. In what is left of our hearts, we know that if there is an election this Nov, it will be a charade. But, yeah, Harris and Biden is an awesome team.

BBC News - Biden's VP pick: Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots   #SoutikBiswas
#NEWS: Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party presidential ticket. Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is one of the party's most prominent figures.
Heard an NPR pundit say that it may actually be her tempestuous past as a DA that balances the ticket. The Tr*mp campaign has been accusing Biden of being "soft" on crime &amp; wanting to "abolish the police" (if only, 'twere true). Now that she's in the mix that attack has no teeth.
I’m a POC, and I’m extremely excited for Biden/Harris.
I got a sawbuck that says Biden thinks this is his running mate. #kamalatheugandanwarrior #kamala #ripkamala  Yukon, Oklahoma
If that isn’t a scream of no confidence in Joe Biden, I don’t know what is.
Slogan for the Biden/Harris ticket....  "PEEPADS &amp; KNEEPADS"  LMAO
I’m more ready for the pres debates! Trump: "if you have ideas for how to fix America, which isn’t broken btw, then why didn't you tell Obama for 8 years, or anyone else the past 50 years? I’m great." Biden: "well you've had 3 1/2 pancakes, i like woody allen films, fish sticks"
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the perfect “better than what we have but not great” duo
Honestly, the only way I would have ever remotely considered Biden is if he had picked Gabbard.
I knew that was coming i seriosly doubt hes a racist but with biden there is no doubt
What happened 5 hours ago, they’ve already moved on. Leftist memories are as good as Hiden Biden’s.
Infuriating and makes me 🤮🤮🤮🤢  Democratic Party sets rules for criticizing Biden’s VP pick Kamala Harris -  -
You think trying to paint Biden as a racist when he literally put an African American woman on the ticket is weak man.  Your downfall is you’re just attacking this time. No vision no plans for a 2nd term besides more cultural wars and more division. No thanks #biden/Harris
I don't agree with Biden's or Harris' stance on banning so-called "assault" weapons. However, I do agree with them on a plethora of other issues and think they are the best folks for the job vs the current embarrassment. And I'm not a single-issue voter.  #BidenHarris2020
If I do, it’ll be a wasted vote. I’m not voting for someone that dislikes my group. Biden doesn’t care about Black folks either.
Sheehan has a pretty brilliant analysis here, of Biden/Harris from a couple of weeks ago, reversing the DNC lurch to the right, how AOC will become a threat from the Left for 2024, and passing a Green New Deal. He thinks Obama should be Sec. of State.
You called biden a racist and a segregationist.  Were you wrong?
Tulsi Gabbard endorsed marriage equality before Barack, Biden and Hillary. What’s the reason Democrats were homophobes before 2013 and only Tulsi gets the blame? Also the only poll that set Tulsi vs Kai showed voters favored Tulsi. This is all reality btws.
Saying this now for future reference. If Biden wins, I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t step down relatively early in his presidency due to “mental decline” of sorts, and Kamala becomes President. Dated: 8/11/20.
I’m curious if this is still true.
You people are always triggered you people destroy cities but your going to make a statement like that about us lol go hid with basement Biden
Vote #BidenHarris2020 to save America!! #BidenHarris
By year 2 or 3.   I’d be surprised if Biden finishes a full term.
Steve Mnuchin probably approves of Biden's choice of VP.
Kamala Harris: Who is Joe Biden’s running mate?
y’all trying to give 20 reasons why Biden picked Kamala and the only reason he did it is cause Obama told him to 😂
He should have, I hate her and she's a 🐍 but any idiot can see she was the best choice after Biden committed to choosing a woman
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Kamala Harris as VP is what you get when you concentrate on skin color instead of policies. Whatever your opinion of her, if you live in a swing state and you don't vote for Biden/Harris, you're a cunt, full stop.
Boy, you sure changed your view of Biden, huh? He's no longer racist, sexist, or believe the women whom have accused him. How fast you are to change your values you were touting while running for president. #TalkingOutOfBothSidesOfHerMouth
I’d like to find it surprising that in the same year there are world wide protests calling for an end to police brutality a super cop is picked as the VP nominee but, joe Biden loves mass incarceration so not surprised at all #toughoncrime #acab
Wanna bet it made Biden look ‘presidential’ for the first time?
What are you talking about? Biden has already agreed to 3 debates. Trump is the one still trying to negotiate...
Hoe Biden didn't pick Harris, the Deep State did!
I’m looking forward to it. Biden did well in the primary debates and Hillary mopped the floor with Trumps dumbass in the 2016 debates, so yeah...bring it. Mr 1917 pandemic ended WW2 is going to get powned.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris: The Most Pro-Abortion Ticket in American History
I figured. That's one reason I didn't mind Biden holding off for however long he wanted to. I knew they were chomping at the bit to attack any of them.
For real, seriously. I am not a fan of Biden, and Kamela has a worrisome track record... I'm pissed that these are our choices... But even as crap as they are, they'll still be better than 4 more years of 45. I don't believe we can survive that.
You’re making the wrong assumption that Biden is making a single decision on anything
Harris is a good tactical choice--she's the attack dog Biden can't be.  Also, she handily gives a middle finger to folks who thought that real police reform or at least less killing babies for hire might come out of this year.  But, y'know, Biden's deeply held "faith," y'all.
Reade has been proven to be a liar. Her ex never said it was Biden and her friends have abandoned her because she’s a liar and psychotic obviously.
Biden is.
I don’t speak your language but when I saw vote Biden I knew it was ok! #RepublicansAgainstTrump
If you think Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will reform our criminal justice system then you shouldn’t be allowed to vote.
Please tell us that you no longer endorse Biden. You were spot-on about Harris in the debates. She is not what this country needs in the #blm era. Please consider a look at  I know you aren’t a libertarian, but she is much closer to your ideals.
Biden—Harris 2020! Leadership we can be proud of once again.
I don’t even care who Joe Biden didn’t pick. We’re playing football!
He never said it was Biden.
Oof, tough break on your VP pick... couldn’t find anyone who at least defended you against your accusers?
Joe Biden is going to cost Joe Biden the election.
Alicia Andrews, Chair of the Oklahoma Democratic Party, discusses Joe Biden's pick of Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Hear more...
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣.... I don’t even have to say anything here...  showing her true values.. I mean... if she had any to show that is #HorribleHarris
Biden shoots himself in the foot and then forgets why it hurts
You do realize Joe Biden has accusations as well? There is no good person on either side. Don’t fool yourself into thinking the DNC is untarnished. The party of the KKK vs. the party of Lincoln.
Racism - Does it bother you that Biden's VP pick will be chosen by "skin color &amp; gender" instead of character!?!
YOU could have beaten Trump.! "Biden/Harris" or (if Biden retires before November) "Sanders/Harris" WILL LOSE to Trump/Pence!
Biden’s VP Pick: What Republicans have to say about Kamala Harris
Harris ‘honored’ to join Biden on Dem ticket
The DNC doesn't care.  If they cared Joe biden wouldn't be their pick.
Is it okay if we admit this race is really between  and  ?  How long after Biden’s president do they invoke the 25th? And they wouldn’t be wrong.
Half my time line love Kamala Harris, the other half hate her. I wanna say something, but right now I'm just Biden my time... 😏
She will but its a sideshow. It just takes one big slip from Biden to cause problems plus all the illegal shenanigans that the GOP and Barr have lined up to fix the Election Belarus style.
He is lying though. My problem with him playing 4 D chess is thinking it’s ok to lie and manipulate us. It’s not ok under any circumstances. It’s not his support of Biden it’s his covering and lying about him and for him.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris for his running mate
Yeah because Biden Harris 2020 is basically a Republican ticket 15 years ago lmao
One thing about  picking  as his vp. Trump is gonna have an hardtime saying Biden is wanting to end police. He picked a cop.
Even if you think Biden would do anything to create effective change, which he won’t (and you’re deluded if you think otherwise), we don’t fucking have time for two slow steps. People are dying and the country is hurling towards catastrophe. We don’t have time for gradualism
The base chose Joe Biden. Looks like you're *still* not over it.
Ofc you do. Joe Biden is also a conservative.
Sure they do, along with Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate?  Joe will be excited when he finds out...
I have a feeling you weren't going to vote for Biden whoever his VP choice would have been, so why do I care about your opinion on her?
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Biden/Harris will decimate Oklahoma’s economy.  stands with them! #Trump2020
#ACAB, Kamala Harris included. No one Biden picks would do anything meaningful to alleviate poverty, ensure healthcare, or end our predatory military &amp; prison industrial complexes. Biden could pick a potato as VP, he's already locked in the uninformed moderate vote.
Photo Gallery: Meet Biden’s VP choice Kamala Harris
Omg.... Can you imagine her disbelief when they lose. Harris: Well i just wasted a perfectly good blow job. Biden: But I I I I I I told to them u know the ones who um did the thing. Harris: Come on Man!!!!
Scary.  Let's see how many black voters take the (deceptive) bait.  More stimulus money from Trump, a stern executive order to protect renters from eviction, strong stance vs China should keep Trump votes high, Biden (as he says-"my guaranteed black") votes WILL stay at home.
I don’t want either one but Orangeface is just as big of a sicko as Biden.
My question – where can I get a Biden-Harris bumper sticker?
In 2016, Americans voted *against* Hillary more so than voted *for* Trump (even though she won the popular vote).  In 2020, looks like Americans will vote *against* Trump more so than vote *for* Biden.  Yay, “modern democracy!”
In the year of #DefundThePolice joe Biden picked a cop 🤣🤡
The GOP has been taken over by a CON MAN and his corrupt cronies! VOTE BIDEN/ HARRIS and save our Country!!!
Agreed how many more outburst you think Biden got in him to mess up his campaign
I’m not a trump fan but can u imagine how bad Biden will look? It wont be funny, it will be sad honestly
So what changed her mind about Biden?
"bIdEn iS An uLtRa cOnSeRvAtIvE AnD No bEtTeR ThAn tRuMp"
Every time. Every fucking time. People overwhelmingly picked Hillary over Bernie in 2016. And then in 2020 they were all “did we stutter we’ll take the neoliberal again.”  Can’t wait for the self-righteous “I will not cast a vote for Biden” thought pieces coming.
NO NO NO! Biden has been photographed MANY times doing predatory behavior to children and women. #JoJorgensen2020 #SAVETHECHILDERN
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate
okay but she still all we got. that’s what y’all not understanding. hold her accountable, yes. but still vote for biden and kamala.
Now that Biden has released the name of his VP pick the “Slut Shaming” has begun. Would it be possible to attack records without retreating to middle-school name calling?   #Election2020
I didn’t even say I wasn’t voting for Biden.  I’m just tired of this response that I see to people talking shit about Joe Biden where they act like the person is covertly supporting Trump because they don’t uncritically kiss Biden’s dementia ridden ass.
Logic. Campaigns are months long arguments between two (or more) sides trying to convince people to vote one way or another. Are you suggesting Trump wasn't saying it with the goal of trying to push voters away from Biden?
Like u said, politics aside, isn’t she the person that kept trying to convict innocent people to keep her conviction rate up? I’m not a trump supporter but to think Biden, who clearly is mentally incapable of the job and now her... 330 million people and this is who we get? Damn
Biden just put the last nail in his bid for presidency's coffin thank you Joe
Anyone who thinks a Biden-Harris ticket isn't as viable as a Trump-Pence ticket is clinically insane.
If you are sane and love this country and democracy you really must vote for Biden-Harris.
So you don’t have to I flipped over to Fox News. The polls are wrong and Biden not only isn’t ahead, he doesn’t have the black vote shored up, so in desperation he went with Harris. Also it’s not only an insult to all women, it’s an insult to every identity specifically
To be clear, this isn’t an endictment on the “ridin’ with Biden” lefties who will actually admit that Biden is a total dogshit Democratic candidate, just this dumbass idea that any slight against Biden is somehow a tacit support for Trump.
I can’t stand these motherfuckers.  It’s either you worship at the altar of Biden or you’re a covert Trump supporter and you secretly want the fall of western civilization. No nuance exists, you have to slobber on Biden’s saggy old balls or you support Trump.
So when’s the debate for Trump vs Biden happening?
But you're not right. In the context of this entire shebang being an argument between Trump and Biden, insults between the two or directed at one another's campaign are in fact ad hominem attacks. You should stop pontificating. You should also stop being a misogynist.
Look after all this Biden was so impressed that he asked Harris to become an important part of his ticket! VP can’t get any better than this! Vote Blue 2020 💙🇺🇸💙
I love and honor my leftist-ass friends who are critical of Biden and Harris. I strive to be as woke as you but if you opt out of voting for Biden/Harris on November 3, you will be, as my grandma used to say, pummelled into unconsciousness with an organic carrot.
Kamala Harris Will Shred Mike Pence in the Vice Presidential Debate
What did tRump do for CA. Make a choice: Biden or tRump?
Sheehan has a pretty brilliant analysis here, of Biden/Harris from a couple of weeks ago, reversing the DNC lurch to the right, how AOC will become a threat from the Left for 2024, and passing a Green New Deal. He thinks Obama should be Sec. of State.
Not all arguments are in the context of a formal debate. Not all are even explicit. Within the context of the "Kamala Harris will be a good VP and an asset to a Biden Administration" conversation, petty insults directed towards her by a political opponent are indeed ad hominem.
Happy to help Biden win. If it pisses a Trump off in the process then that’s just gravy.
Biden selects running mate, expected to be revealed as early as today, reports say
Eat shit jimbo we ridin’ with Biden
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bernie is kinda left, and he is much further left than Biden or Harris. You’re just ignorant to politics
maybe you should take some of the energy you use on lecturing marginalized people on why they should vote for biden and put it towards organizing, donating, and direction action that immediately and materially benefits their lives and their communities
Like opposing Medicare for All?
1994 was 26 years ago. People can change in 26 years (optimism for Biden). Trump changes within a single sentence, so I don’t understand how that’s hard for you to grasp.
Congratulations to Kamala Harris on being chosen to be Biden’s Vice President.❤️🇺🇸 #KamalaHarrisForVP
That doesn't speak well for Tulsi's political judgment. She never came even 10% as close to relevance as Harris in the primary. Harris saw it was going nowhere, so she bowed out, just as literally every candidate should have except Biden.
I agree for sure. Seeing Biden picking someone who literally called him racist and then had to drop out due to her criminal justice history just doesn’t make sense to me. But I’m not well versed in politics fr so maybe there’s a bigger picture I’m not seeing. I doubt it doe lol
Putting this out there as a prediction. We'll see how it ages...  Biden will be replaced by the #DNC with #Clinton due to an unforeseen medical condition. It will be the first ever all female ticket. Mark it down. #Election2020 #PresidentialElection
My hunch is that Joe Biden will pull out of the race before October, Kamala will maintain her VP part of the ticket AND the new Democrat candidate for President.............BERNIE SANDERS!!

Congratulations Vice President Biden  for picking Kamala Harris  for your running mate! 🎉🥂🎊 Excellent choice.
Biden you are the worst candidate to run for President since Murderer Hillary Clinton!!!  Trump is the best we’ve had in a very long time!  TRUMP 2020!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. Democrats Never!!!!!!
this tweet wasn’t meant to shame people into voting for biden so please stop retweeting/engaging with it if that is your intention!
Not as weird as Trump /joe debate. Biden won’t know where he is at.
What’s a worse pick?  Joe Biden picking Kamala Harris or the Raiders picking JaMarcus Russell? #VPHarris
Had to break my Twitter break for this. Harris/Biden 2020
Go ahead, vent about how you’re aware of everything everyone else is also aware of when it comes to Biden/Harris, go on. We know but please proceed.   If it helps you sleep better before going to vote, have a blast 🚀
Ya’ll ain’t anti-biden enough for me.
It's crazy. You can't get more of an establishment centrist, career insider than Biden, yet he's still accused of being a communist or socialist.
Still more than Biden had and Eric is not the lead actor here.
You’re welcome! Yeah I just kinda don’t wanna exist that much anymore. The whole Biden presidency certainly hasn’t helped
Breaking: Kamala was stunned that he was tabbed to be Biden's V.P pick.
She flipped my Mom’s vote from Biden to Jorgensen.
Then Trump will be briefed and create a new executive order to protect renters, etc.  You just flushed both Biden and now......Harris.  Kamala will never be President now, once Biden loses in November.  She would have made a nice ticket with Joe Kennedy III.
Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Kamala call Biden a racist no more than 6 months ago? I guess it’s like Ted Cruz kissing Trump’s ass even though he called his wife ugly.
For my birthday this year I would like to be celebrating President Biden.  November 3rd we vote November 18th I wish to still be celebrating a new administration.
My hunch is that Joe Biden will pull out of the race before October, Kamala will maintain her VP part of the ticket AND the new Democrat candidate for President.............BERNIE SANDERS!!
My hunch is that Joe Biden will pull out of the race before October, Kamala will maintain her VP part of the ticket AND the new Democrat candidate for President.............BERNIE SANDERS!!
Then, Trump will create an executive order that does protect renters. The huge anchor falling to the floor of the ocean now has hooked both Biden &amp; Harris, sorry. Can you use your time and money to support schools, child care and mentoring programs for youth instead of wasting it
sooooo many people who were already planning on not voting are gonna announce they’re not voting Biden/Harris lmao
Everyone needs to calm down. Joe Biden doesn’t even know who he picked.
what kind of question is "does Kamala Harris help or hurt Joe Biden's chances"
Pelosi WILL NOT succumb to Harris, NICE TRY!  My hunch is that Joe Biden will pull out of the race before October, Kamala will maintain her VP part of the ticket AND the new Democrat candidate for President.............BERNIE SANDERS!!
Biden and Harris in 2020, there isn't a better choice for the nation.
but many people seem to expect us to vote for biden/harris without voicing any discontentment...... why???? when did they suddenly become entitled to our enthusiasm, given that both of them have extraordinarily problematic histories??? we’re just not supposed to talk about that??
Nah different electorate. More young voters. And more angry voters than in 2016. The pandemic. The mass protests. More Gen-Z voters. And Hillary was Astronomically more hatable than Biden. Biden just seems more stupid gaffs than evil.
I've waited a long time for a   ticket announcement.  With the pandemic, February seems decades ago.  Biden/Harris will mop the floor with Trump/Pence!
Trump2020 best president ever!!.biden and Harris.going under Trump2020
I knew that Biden would pick her I love this pick!
Interrupting our BB tl to announce Joe Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his running mate! Here’s to a new beginning in November! I’m trusting it will happen! 💙💙💙💙 #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt
At least Biden/Harris will be getting them.
Facts. The Biden campaign picked the 47th president.   It’s that “back to normal” stuff that neoliberals asked for.
Ok fair, so let’s talk about the Biden accusations too then along with Kamala’s evil past
Yeah if more people voted for him than Biden
tRump is so disgusting.  I'm so pleased with Biden's choice and am soooo annoyed with some of the hateful things that have already come out of his supporter's mouths, including people close to me.   I'll never understand how their hateful brains work.   🥺
Harris unlike Milano actually says she believes all women (me too) Biden has an open claim of sexual misconduct (Tara Reade). Hmmm hows that going to play out.  #Trump2020LandslideVictory
no radical leftist would call Joe Biden their 'friend' and a 'good man'
Joe Biden will not make it four years as president. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for Kamala Harris to be president. Vote for  or  or literally anybody else.
This is going to be funny as hell to watch. Biden: Segregationist.  Harris:Incarcerationist. Haha wonder who is actually going to support and bring up the black community.
Oh he wasted no time to put up a Kamala/Biden ad on twitter for his followers to retweet.
Kamala Harris is bad. Kamala Harris is a cop. Kamala Harris is horrible on criminal justice reform. Kamala Harris is horrible on drug decriminalization. Kamala Harris is does not care about you. Do not vote for Biden/Harris. Vote third-party.
Well considering Biden isn’t a rapist...
I mean... with all this justice system overhaul the country is going through/needs... Biden picks the poster women for why it’s all screwed up in the first place?  She’s basically a cop who wants to President right?
So you think Biden groped children?
Enjoy what you didn’t sign an executive order for the poor and middle class people for the stimulous checks so what the fuck is there to enjoy not unless you’re talking about Joe Biden again ain’t nobody gives a fuck anymore 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
We agree on the facts. You're just willing to interpret them in a way that justifies a vote for Biden. That's cool. I get it. Just don't pee on my leg and tell me its raining. She has a record as a prosecutor that cannot be ignored.
You appear to lack any real human empathy. However, you will probably be a one term potus. Biden could be too, if elected. But please, sir, get some help. Much of America cares about you....it just didn't work out long-term, and you deserve to get well. So do we.  🙏🏼♥️🇺🇸
Am a trial lawyer, but not relevant to post. Am also a non-trump conservative. Any VP pick for Biden stands a realistic chance of becoming POTUS based on Biden’s age and health. I was leaning towards him until this pick. It’s a bad pick. He could really pull w/ a moderate choice
And if COVID-19 didn’t escalate to this point, trump would’ve won easily. Now he’s facing a rising death toll and is forced to fund Obamacare because they had no plan up until this point. Biden is riding the protests and pandemic to election.
Uh Kamala and Biden are running together it is not a vote for each person. She will own Mike Pence in the debates. Mike will be asking for “Mother”
Can’t believe Biden picked koonala Harris as his vp pick. I actually can believe it but you hate to see it
And Biden supported the crime bill (which increased budgets for policing nationwide). Tell me again how Biden is a crazy Marxist that wants to defund the police?? If anything trump is making a good law and order case for Biden 😂
In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate   #ScottDetrow
expected nothing less from biden lol.. SNL bout to be lit for 4 years tho
How can she be a good running mate?  Nobody likes her, that’s why she dropped out.  This doesn’t help Biden, it just sealed the deal for Trump to win
and this tweet really isn’t just about biden, it applies to bernie and warren and kendra horn, etc
Okay Biden! #KamalaHarrisForVP 😱
It’s like Biden’s handlers don’t even want to win.   #JoJorgensen2020

It’s not as crazy as it seems if you listen to Biden and Harris-thats what they are encouraging and in agreement with. Absolutely disgusting at best. Thank you for this! Peace🌸
I wish the President use this video as one of his campaign ads, he has a lot of ammunition on Biden and he should use it.
It’s your vote to cast! I’m voting for Biden/Harris.
Twitter "FACT CHECKED" and banned the President.  But I havent been banned yet.  Please see pic below.  If you believe in this...  Like Biden said, Youre a lying dog face pony soldier. You aint black. Come'on man!! You know you know the thing. Poor kids are just as intelligent as
18-24 year olds.  Yall gonna be stupid and vote for this...  Remember if you dont vote Biden you aint black and Camela wasnt pro black and proud.  She took office as an India native no mention of being a black native.  Twitter fact check that!
Ill forget it and I will say your name wrong just to show how much I dont care for you.  Gross.  Disgusting.  If you run as VP for Biden you aint black.
Twenty Twenty Rigged = 222 / 888  Trump getting re-elected. BUT Elections are rigged. If THEY rig this election via the "Mail-In" and other means, then expect to see Harris installed as President when Biden forgets where he is.
This is well worth the read!
Biden Pick Kamala Harris = 1110 I was keeping it a bit to myself.
Hahah  Dot not feather.  Lmao.  Andd.........  Now she is Black.  Is she gonna get a dark sun tan and try natural black face?  Omg.  If you dont vote for Biden and Kahmahlah...  You aint black and its okay, neither is she or Them, They?  They are not black.  Haha...
And Russians and the Chinese want Biden and kamala. Trump is to hard on them. TRUMP AND PENCE 2020
Why am I NOT surprised?? I still don’t understand how Biden got the nomination in the first place! And I think Kamala was the only one that said yes. I would never have my enemy as my #2. She talked all that smack and look at her now! Peace🌸!
Well, no, he’s not fit to RUN that’s why he’s Ridin’ Biden!! (Sorry it couldn’t be helped...tried not too😂) Peace🌸!
Hahaha...  Sleepy Joe made his first promise   Train wreck!  He said a black African American and  Even  IS IN THE ARGUMENT.  CAN YOU REALLY TRUST BIDEN?  DOES HIS WORD MEAN ANYTHING.  I SAY NO!   KEPT HIS PROMISES AND FOUGHT FOR THEM!  Word is Bond!
Haha...  Sleepy Joe Biden forget he was gonna pick an African American black woman?  This girl is INDIA INDIAN AMERICAN.  I can hear Joe,  Come'on man! I know what I said at the the, thing but she is a woman. She has the you know the Thing.
Biden is a boss that place America first. However Trump doesn’t understand that America comes first , before petty, vindictive qualms.
I don’t see Biden winning this election. Which is a good thing.
Biden has an entire cabinet to fill with girl magic 😍
I just ask myself WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PARENTS?? I raised my kids to be aware that no one should touch them where their bathing suit covers, but Biden seems to have shot that all to hell...now I have to include “sniffing” with my grandkids?!? Peace🌸.
It's really Harris-Biden but its cool
You’re shooting yourself in the foot Biden. And you know it!

Is Joe Biden wife going to read the statement or will Biden stumble through it himself?
Unbelievable. And half the country will still vote for Biden.
Obama and Biden could have their 8 years for good, but they didn’t do that.
There is no way Biden can be or should be elected.  He isn't even President yet and others are dictating what he will do or else.  Please people, when you vote, vote for Trump a man proven to stand against the dictators before it's too late.

Let's give China a discount. Will make a package deal. We'll put Biden and Pelosi together at a discount. They are always for sale right?
Sweet!! Thanks- although I’m sure it won’t make Biden happy...if he can follow...I DO feel bad for him, but not bad enough to lie and vote for him!! Peace🌸.
What does "Biden And Oprah" equal in English/Sumerian Gematria? ;)
I think she is lost. Her and Biden are super crazy!
You could say I hate Trump and vote biden and im still say youre pretty.  I do like your messages.  Great work!
I’m talking about Biden being a racist. He always has been. So that’s just proof of it then and now. Peace.
HAVE YOU EVEN TRIED TO DO ANY JOURNALISM?  HAVE YOU EVEN ASKED FAULSI FOR A LIE TO COVER UP OR GO BACK ON HIS SPEECH?  YOU GIVE BIDEN A DO OVER TO LIE HIS WAY OUT OF EVERYTHING HE SAYS.  COME ON DO WORK.

I couldn’t give a rats behind how he pronounces it at least he knows WHAT to say unlike ummm (let’s say it together, class) Biden?!!😂🤣😂
Indeed! And after another 4 years for him, it will make Biden to old to try this run again. Tells you how bad Dems have it if he is there best foot forward! Peace.
Trumps running for Office, Biden is running scared to his basement.
Is it just me or does Biden’s side of the house constantly have to explain what he said? I don’t see Trump do it even 1/20 of what Biden and his handlers have to do-that my opinion and I’m sticking to it! Peace.

What do you know about the serious THREAT on Joe Biden when you said on your show, “Something BAD is going to happen to  befor the Election!?” Have you contacted the  about this grave threat? Also, another Fox host said the same thing!? #FoxNews
Is the  looking into her comment about something happening to  before the Election!!??? That’s a huge statement to make! What does she mean by that? What does she know? Is somebody going to try to assassinate Joe Biden!???
It seems like Biden’s entire strategy is based around the goal of beating Trump.  Is that what you’re seeing?  And is “what you are against” enough to win an election?
So basically she is saying she lied trying to defeat Biden. That means now she will lie to try and defeat  #ItWasADebate
Great visual - the trump train will plow through your town at break neck speeds and blow right past the things you need to have addressed while blowing environmental needs away. The Biden team will see each need as it comes and act with purpose and determination. #flipitblue

Well Vickie, I mean my tweet to you was pretty straightforward in that it was a question based on your tweet about Biden-Harris. Had nothing to do with  but I’m glad you acknowledge you can’t even follow a simple question (or realize I was joking about all.the.way)
Really? Good Lord you are ready to fuck everyone completely over under Trump. If Trump stays in office this country is over. Period. I didn't want Biden/Harris but they won't destroy the Constitution. They won't reverse gay marriage or Row v Wade. They won't stop SS &amp; Medicare.

Biden and Harris are WEAK on crime and want to see our cities burn, unlike President Trump and Vice President Pence who are working to restore LAW AND ORDER.
Phony Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s new liberal handler.
This Biden speech is absolutely amazing and Presidential as all get out.
If Americans needed a reason not to vote for Biden, you just got a big juicy one.
He stopped the flights incoming from China while Pelosi was telling everyone to come to China Town because it was safe. The rest was the failures of Democratic leadership from mayors &amp; govenors. Also if he spied on Biden it would probably be a horror film. GD Pedophiles.
Remember when kamala said she believes everyone of Biden’s accusers. What happen there? Hush money I assume
Gross. We need to shed more light on this. World wide pedophilia ring going on right now. Her &amp; Biden are complicit. KLM!
The ugly visages of the promoters for Biden/Harris are so hateful. Their voices and speech patterns obnoxious.  These two demented and hater of America are what Dims/media/Rinos want.  A Godless Communist Government. Unbelievable
maybe they could put out a letter about what they'd do if Trump used sketchy FISA warrants and political appointees  to spy on Biden
Harris could not be president if Biden went down. Her parents were not citizens when she was born
If something happened to Biden Harris cannot be his replacement it would go to pelocy
Biden was a gaffe machine when he was young, have you seen him lately Billy?
Open our eyes and ears to this evil evil duo. Biden/Harris
Joe Biden said Obama is the first “smart, articulate and good looking African American” do not get manipulated by the most racist politician in the books.
Kind of fitting that she would run with Biden who I truly believe is racist....sad that it is being hiden
Back in Black w/Harris &amp; Biden
Biden: I’m not sure you’re the right fit. Harris: I use Pantene. Biden: Welcome to the ticket.
Biden said he would pick a woman
Let’s be honest. In 2016, HRC was the worst candidate in the history of candidates. Republicans couldn’t have that. Instead of learning a lesson, Democrats are now outdoing themselves with the Biden/Harris ticket. Blame yourselves. Hail to that red hat wearing 2-term booger.
My vote is going straight to Biden
I’m more of the flip the red and blue states to green. I lean alil more on red myself but both suck right now I just can’t vote for Biden if anyone takes offense to that you shouldn’t because I don’t take offense to you voting for Biden to each his own we’re all fuck either way
And I hope this isn’t interpreted as a “wasted vote” argument. I don’t think any type of voting is a waste. But I do think that Biden needs every vote he can get, and I think he is the candidate with the best chance to beat shitbird 45.
I know Biden isn’t amazing. He wasn’t my first choice, or even my second or third choice. I don’t think he’s a great person. But he is who we’ve got. Voting for a third-party candidate is a risk we can’t take if we want this unqualified tyrannical fool out of office.
“In Historic Pick, Joe Biden Taps Kamala Harris To Be His Running Mate”. NPR tag line for Biden picking his running mate. Apparently somebody at NPR actually has a sense of humor!
Sorry, correction, she did attend a Church of God as a child but she considers herself a “Black Baptist”
Kamala’s biggest potential impact for Biden will be the loss of California when it would have been a slam dunk without her.  CA is getting fed up with Shit Hole San Francisco Politics and bully LA Politics.   Outcome TBD??
Perhaps because Biden is suffering from the early onset of dimentia.   — Easy ticket in for a potential presidency via the Article II Succession Clause. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris

I agree.  A weak play from Biden.  But who else was there for him to loose with out there.

Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary  #FoxNews
Once again Trump wants to cut taxes for the upper 5%. Raise their taxes Joe.
It’s either you can make a terrible voting choice or the worst voting choice. No inbetween. We had some amazing people up on the debate stage... I don’t know how we got here. I don’t even know anyone who voted for Biden. Wtf
Biden is said to be pleased that his pick for VP is you know... That lady from that place.
Trump machine is lying about this.
Death team for President. Biden Harris. Abortion  infanticide. Coming soon:  one child policy  forced sterilization  forced vaccinations forced euthanasia.  Godless society.
Someone would always be salty with WHOEVER Biden picked, but let’s not take away the moment of the first black woman tapped to be Vice President. American history.
What will Tammy do? Remain a Senator? Or...??? But, I'm still voting Biden/Harris 2020. Good enough for me, I think.
Of course she did. She cares nothing. Nothing for America. She panders. She lusts  for power. She is an empty empty soul like the demented racist Biden. She accepts his racism as she knows she will be President.  In her sick sick mind.
Yay! So happy Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate... she’ll make a great future President :)
Trump instantly lashes out at Kamala Harris as Joe Biden announces her as VP pick ?
Kasich has become a left wing weirdo supporting AOC &amp; Bernie in support of Biden.   Don’t listen to what he says anymore, his actions have set his political path right through Socialism
With Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's ‘political living will,’ he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to raise taxes, cut police funding, kill energy jobs and open our borders. #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020
America can't afford Joe Biden. #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
Just when I think  couldn’t possibly be any dumber
Harris will dominate the debate stage against Pence but how will Biden do against Trump 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Biden has chosen Kamala Harris as his VP pick!      DO NOT treat her like u did Hilary! Don't ask her abt her hair/clothing choices! Treat her the same u would a male candidate! Don't belittle her b/c she's female! #Respect is the key! #BidenHarris!
I’M SOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!! Let’s go Biden/Harris 2020!!! #BidenHarris2020
Biden needs to Quit lying or listen more closely.   Cannot remember much and creates fiction too often.
Biden|Harris is official
Sounds like a Biden lie!!
Biden and everyone said he shouldn’t ! Anyone saying he was right doing that now? Oh hell no ! Too easy to try to blame him when you absolutely know it wasn’t his fault ! Geez! Grow up and at least be honest !
Joe Biden is too busy Making under the table deals with China.  Wake up people !
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed that just 13% of voters say their vote is up for grabs in the presidential election   via
But but but Ben, it has training wheels. So Biden is more competent than that Raccoon!
Biden Campaign supporters are using Trumps Strategies and rewrapping them into a Democrat illusion so Biden &amp; voters think Biden created the idea.   DEJA VOUS—PLAGIARISM AGAIN!!!
I keep asking and no one will answer my serious question. What has Biden done for America? Not sarcasm, I honestly want to know.
Well this what this Native American has said for a while White people need to start suing it is their civil right this is discrimination at its finist just like Biden is being demanded to choose a Black female for VP it is just bullshit and it needs to stop it is nasty racism.
Just a born sick liar  Biden
0% chance Biden tweeted this himself. Because he's literally mentally incapable
Here we fucking go....They are already trying to say that the woman that Joe Biden, takes to be his VP was involved in the sabotage, corruption and  investigation into the 2016 Elections!! WTF!!??? Are you serious!!#TrumpPressConference
A last ditch effort, just like in 2016 and Hillary Clinton dump, they want to come up with non-fact based BS to come up with to damage Joe Biden. People are much smarter this time around and will NOT FALL FOR IT!!
Duh? Biden isn’t a progressive? We all know this.
Way less expensive than a totally botched pandemic response by Trump, &amp; these supports for the safety net will address the social determinants of health, reduce healthcare costs. We this under Biden because we will still have Social Security &amp; Medicare. Trump tried to end both!
Due to pandemic...Congress must pass relief bill that gives a person $3 for every time Joe Biden has said something racist.
We are a nation divided. Sorry to say. Elect Biden and things  really fall apart. Worse than Obumma times.
Backing a fool like Biden gets you a empty suit with no memory. How will he function? Let me guess. The dems will slip in Clinton, or just as bad, Obumma the court jester.
Joe Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare for decades.  Now, Biden is promising YOUR benefits to illegal immigrants.  President Trump is protecting Social Security and Medicare!  #LeadRight #ArmyForTrump #MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat #Trump2020 #Trump2020Landslide
I’m aware of two #Tulsa houses that had Biden signs taken out of their yard and replaced with “Commie” written on the driveway. One is a law enforcement officer.
Biden caused the crap in Latin America.
Instead of debating on the national stage maybe Joe will challenge Trump to a "Basement Push-up Challenge".  Biden is not worthy or mentally capable of holding the office of president.
To heal this nation as Joe Biden would say. I think a woman on the ticket is exactly what we need to heal this nation. No matter who it is he decides to pick!! And a woman who is very ambitious for that position is exactly what we need. #TrumpFailsAmerica
Biden can ride a bike, u can't!  gave wealthy a huge tax break that left out most Americans, stocks are already down b/c of ur incompetent response to COVID, same for economy/jobs! Looks like YOU are to blame donnie! 11/3/20 Americans will #MakeTrumpGoAway!🙂
That segment of the population who think a vote for Biden is anything but a vote against Trump really cracks me up.
Black ppl not fuckin with Biden look at his numbers with blacks
ok, where are the tough questions on Biden???
YOU are the biggest political crime &amp; scandal in American history! Hopefully, for the good of our country, YOUR removal from office will begin on Nov. 3rd when America tells u--YOU'RE FIRED!  Make America Great Again--Vote Biden!  #Biden2020! #TrumpCantRideABike
Biden is worthy of EVERY vote we give him! YOU are not worthy of living in the people's house b/c YOU are a HUGE disgrace, a failure, a laughingstock worldwide, &amp; a JOKE! YOU are a racist, vile, bully, greedy, LIAR! #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Biden was out riding bikes while you were running away from strong women journalists' hard questions! We prefer a real man, not a whiny whuss baby who runs away from a strong woman b/c she called you out on ur lies! #TrumpHatesStrongWomen!  #TrumpIsWeak!
A tax that they will have to pay back! Another burden to put on their shoulders! Man, ur making  a Biden win that much more certain! Thank You!  #TrumpCantRideABike #TrumpsCovidCoverup
What's not racist about the left demanding Biden choose a woman, not white, as his VP choice?   "must be black"  How's that not racist? Or even sexism?
Biden has already forfeited his right to be President.  Class act—NO!!!
A childish response you think everyone who is against Biden more than Trump is a redneck, kkk or a racist but most of those people just don’t want to feed into the corruption and are trying to keep the government from taking every right that ever American has regardless of race
Another term for bully, although VP Biden will be fine.
Of course.  Russia targets Biden in election-meddling effort, U.S. intelligence says
Biden was sniffing her hair, went in for the kill!
Because they know Hiding Biden has no chance! See you later quid pro Joe!
Biden was marginal when he told Obama that Obamacare was a big fuc’n deal.  That was many years ago.
Biden at the new libtard rally!
History professor who has accurately predicted every election since 1984 says Trump will lose
Lead on Mr. President...and apologize for attacking Biden’s faith, you erred.  Your big enough to admit it.
Keep to the issues and no disparaging remarks about Biden’s faith.
I don't care who Biden picks.  I'm still voting for him.
But trump "did" say, "Biden doesn't deserve the black vote..." because of his gaffe.  I would express that the media didn't say that, trump did.... ijs
ha ha ha!  We're NOT talking about African immigrants! LOL     Nonetheless, Kenyans are different than Nigerians as they are different from Ugandans - which is the point Biden was making;  there is no monolithic ideology among a specific race;  the diversity is what matters!
You know nothing about Catholic Faith. Biden is a heretic. Abortion infanticide same sex marriage socialism. Contraception. You are an ignorant idiot. A mortal sin for  a Catholic to vote Biden
Biden will probably just keep his cool and not get into an argument with trump because will turn it against Biden if he doesn't say every word perfectly when even trump can't do it but that's okay with trump cuz he's president
Notice I said “One dumb thing” and not incredibly racist thing every time he speaks once a month. I wish Trump wasn’t the better choice here but if you think Biden has what it takes you are either willing to risk our entire country to get trump out or you are blindto what you see
And if Biden says something racist every time he speaks that is an issue. Democrats go through Trumps many speeches and tries to find one dumb thing he says and light it on fire and then pour gasoline on it while most normal stable individuals is watching dems do this like “WTF?”
Yeah that’s what I was saying about taking everything he says at face value. I agree that’s a ridiculous thing to say that he has done more for Black people than Lincoln but thinking highly of ones self is a whole lot different then the shit Biden says.
There is only one African American culture and country? I can think of a few different ones. And if Democrats are going to take everything Trump says at face value then people with a brain are inclined to take everything that Biden says at face value.
Biden talks a good fight but never delivers.  His inactions are hard to understand until he talks and says what he really thinks.  Conclusion:  he lies a lot—Another BS Democrat!!
Biden is too demented &amp; delusional to recognize the implications of announcing “black woman”  as a prerequisite for the VP position.
Biden thinks Jobs was The Apple Computer guy!!
It will need to be a long add.  Or Can just make several and just rerun them over and over.  That way many will think all Biden does is make goofy assertions and his racist attitudes will become vote changers.
If you're riding Biden--you're on the highway to hell.
Biden is a good man but that would be a stupid move at this point. Trump wouldn't do it for him or anyone else and Trump deserves not to get away with everything he's done
Mr. President, respect VP Biden’s beliefs in God.  We all differ a little.  Respect that.
Ummmmm...... That's exactly what Biden was talking about.  (You did watch the video right) ijs
Lay out truth for the 2020 voters of what occurred.  DOJ-FBI-CIA-NSA-Obama &amp; Biden-Hillary-Rice—ALL instigators &amp; coverup artists wanting Trump to be illegally persecuted &amp; crucified. DISAPPOINTING BUT EXPECTED—THEY WERE UnAmerican FOR 8 YEARS. NO WONDER HILLARY LOST HER EMAILS
Yes, yes it does. You cannot hold conservative values and support Biden. You need to rise above your hurt feelings.
Old rambling UNCLE JOE (STALIN)BIDEN
Yep. Good old Uncle Joe(STALIN) Biden.
Whatever Hiding Biden. Go back to playing with your dolls in your basement gePEDO!
It’s funny because Trump is def not a believer in any faith and Biden is a practicing catholicMine is my new Joe Biden/Harris face mask. And I will proudly be wearing to show my support
Maybe Kamal Harris figured out she was for Biden, and wasn't for trump, and that's what made her turn black?
NJ will be going for Biden Harris in a BIG way.
Your heart is huge &amp; Kamala is great! However, can a man/Biden w/ONLY 70% of his brain capacity REALLY lead the United States, as we explore new energies, fight new greed, hopefully gain immunity, continue to thwart China, keep Putin content, while educating ALL Americans? HONEST
I like brainless Biden
I support both you and Biden but, truth be told, we have had AT LEAST three and a half years to do those things and look where we’re at.
To start, a number of anonymously sourced quotes from Obama leaked out throughout the 2020 Biden campaign where the former president allegedly expressed doubts about his former running mates’ fitness for office.
Half the country would be unemployed in a Biden administration during a pandemic.
It sure does matter! At least Trump has done what he said he would. It’s not gonna affect SS. Unless all you watch is msnbc or cnn.  Biden has argued for cuts or freezes to SS for much of his 45 year career. What has he accomplished in all those years?
One of the worst run unions and organizations in America endorses Biden? Seems about right!
I mean you could argue most politicians are. Biden picking her IMO alienates his current radical base and fails to secure a sizable portion of mods playing the "law and order card" his party cant even denounce a terrorist group let alone prosecute rioters
After 51 Years in DC, If you think Joe Biden  is suddenly going to bring change. You are an Idiot!
I'm pretty sure I remember just a few days ago Biden on his bike zooming past a Fox news reporter.
Trump does a horrific job uniting all races, creeds &amp; religions. He's a scientific dolt. Yet, from his trade bills to his Middle East peace acts, to his opiate crackdown at US ports of entry, to his strong stance on China, to having 100%ok-90% brain capacity, he "trumps" Biden!
Non issue.  Israel/UAE is a huge issue and HUGE win for Trump!  Biden/Obama wussed out, delayed any peace talks, and have the blood of dead US soldiers on their wimpy hands-when they gave Iran 150 billion!!!!
It’s what they want. They know Biden can’t win, so they want away to delegitmize and cast “doubt” on the election.
Biden / Harris the faces of what basic bitches look like hahaha
Joe biden however did say he wanted to defund social security
I guess we listen to opisite news sources and therefore get the bias we want. All i know is I am hearing reporters ask people and those people are stating Biden will not change dates or add a 4th.
You could be right, but local organizers are fighting quite an uphill battle against the two-party power structure. The fact that we’ve had only two parties worth anything for many decades now shows what a difficult process that is. Again, not saying I’m going against Biden
He just needs to shut up and bring back Fauci and Burke. Did he send them to Siberia? We NEED their expertise not his BS. Biden doesn’t support wacko Qanon cult members to get their votes.
Not saying I’m not voting Biden, but let’s say my dream is one day the US is de-polarized like Germany or one of many other Euro countries with a true DemSocialist party and many diverse parties with diverse interests. How do I get there by voting Dem in perpetuity?
0 cap detected. Saw someone call biden a fascist, socialist, liberals, communist unironically
After a couple weeks off, due to the birth of my newborn son❤..here's poll results from my Jul. 15th #POTUSelectionpoll: (including my vote = 28 votes) Trump 4- 15% *Jorgensen 7- 26% (Winner)* Biden 6- 22% Hunter 3- 11% Carroll 1- 4% Hawkins 3- 11% Blankenship 0- 0% West 4- 15%
Legit If i had a nickel for every time I've had to explain to my moms friends that im an actual socialist and that biden isn't some radical communist and that he's more of a republican than anything I'd be so rich that i could give it to the poor
What like funding HBC’s and making sure it’s 10 years instead of begging every year? Or creating opportunity zones in minoritie neighborhoods? Or signing first step act that allowed a lot of young black men that Biden and Clinton’s crime bill put in prison out of prison?
Joe Biden Has Called for Social Security Cuts 3 Times / ⁦ ⁦
Huh? Now in English, please. (Note: the biggest difference will be that Joe Biden will be POTUS46.)
Consider, in the event they win, that she will very likely 'have' to replace Biden before his first year in office. He does not come across as a man who is mentally fit for the office  I truly believe a vote for Biden is really a vote for Kamala.

In her first two days as Joe Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris has vouched for Biden’s character on race and more. And the enthusiasm surrounding her historic candidacy has brought in a record $48 million in 48 hours.
You DID during the primary; Biden stuck to a relatively moderate platform and ran away with it, nonetheless. That should tell you what most voters are after. Regardless, this election is effectively a binary choice. The only leverage you have over Biden is to threaten his...

I can’t wait until you and Biden are in the White House.
Once again, any attacks against him reduce his chances against Trump. I guess you'd rather have Trump as President?  If it were a less odious opponent, fine. But it's Trump. And yes, hurting Biden helps Trump.
I'm just going to quote this on every Joe Biden tweet from now until the election.
I love hearing Kamala Harris talk about the plan that Elizabeth Warren wrote for Joe Biden.
Dr West is voting for Biden... I’m almost guaranteed not to, but if people like Dr West will vote for him, you can’t say he’s a hypocrite. He understands harm reduction. I’m in a red state so I vote Green, but harm reduction exists. Vaush made a good video on this.
If #BidenHarris win, and the Republicans gain control of the House, make  Speaker.  When #Biden is removed due to mental issues and #Harris is found to be ineligible, Jordan becomes #POTUS
Progressives are supposed to back Biden/Harris, while the party actively tries to destroy a progressive candidate's campaign against a "moderate" incumbent by using homophobia? The Dems can kiss my progressive ass.
Def don’t think Biden has the charisma of say, an Obama or a Reagan or even Trump. Putting him out there like this feels like being served re-heated leftovers. I don’t think he has the ability or the desire to gain the same kind of religious devotion as is given to 44 and 45
oh yeah that is kamala harris’ proposal that you just sent i was referring to biden’s. not like any of this matters anyway biden’s ass ain’t gonna get elected 😂
To me it looks like a lot of the enthusiasm for Biden is wishful thinking, like “Well, let’s make the most of this and give him our full support,” gaslighting themselves until they believe he’s amazing, while a large chunk of Trump supporters seem to borderline worship him.
You look like a bot. Are you a bot?
VOTE FOR BIDEN
Press ushered out of Biden- Kamala nomination doc signing. Why in Hell am I the only person bringing this up???
One thing is forsure, no flippin way they dont swap out Biden
Biden will most certainly get replaced. Maybe they want two women
Biden is elected.  Biden dies.  Token brown female VP assumes office.  Police state becomes worse under her reign.  Laugh.
When will they get rid of Biden? Predictions? 👇🏽 who are they swapping him with?
Listen, Biden and Harris are not perfect. They have issues with their past that they will need to deal with and make changes, but to say that because they aren't perfect, you should sit one out and let the current President get re-elected? Go fuck yourself.  Vote his ass out.
That Biden, Kamala doc signing was infamous!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In no way, shape, or form do i think Biden is a good candidate but i think this is very misleading. His tax plan is actually fairly realistic IMO and are targeted at people making over $400,000 (the 1%). And I do support the increase of the capital gains tax.
these are our choices. Absolutely fucking hate it. But we can survive a Biden presidency. We can elect other progressive candidates down the ballot. We can apply leftward pressure to Biden and still have a functioning country at the end. 4 more years of 45 will destroy us. (2/2)
What our President is trying to do is called Fascism. So whatever problems you have with the Biden/Harris candidacy shut your fucking mouth and vote against fascism!! #BidenHarris2020
Exactly this. A Biden/Harris ticket isn't perfect, and in fact there are def some legit concerns... but in the absence of a perfect candidate, I'd rather have the imperfect one that'll still at least push some liberal policies over the man who's actively trying to destroy America
If the democrats had any integrity, which they lack, they’d realize this disqualifies Joe Biden from being president by their own admission.
Vote for Biden/Harris cause we have more of a survival chance with them even if it’s still scary and with them we maybe will still have a victory 8 years down the road.
Raymond Arroyo: Is Kamala Harris Biden's shadow president?  via
I think the issue is that it ONLY resonates with people in the Fox News bubble. Joe Biden isn’t nearly as reviled by the general public as Hillary was. Calling Joe “far left” only works on those who would’ve never voted for him anyway.
Honestly, I would buy the rhetoric, but it failed last time. And paying more attention this time, the dnc will continue to do everything in its power to disenfranchise progressives. I can't not vote for Biden, but it's hard for me to be too upset with people that won't.
Watching my friends who grew up raving, are pro marijuana, and support BLM and defund the police now try to do mental gymnastics to justify supporting Biden and Harris makes me very sad. Just another example that logical consistency is dead in America.
THREADCEPTION  But no, seriously, there's some really important points made here and I'm guilty of doing it myself. I have legitimate concerns about some policies that a Biden/Harris ticket might advance... but they'd honestly still be far, far better than 4 more years of 45.
Mika supporting a proven racist and sexual predator in
Can't wait for Biden to win and people to remember dems suck too.
Their polls also show Biden leading President Trump.
We just had a poll showing Biden +3. Somebody is *wrong* by a lot. My guess, this one.
Am I the only one who feels the Biden/Harris campaign materials and messaging targeted towards women reeks of a certain implicit TERF vibe? Like, beyond Harris’ brutally hostile treatment of Trans inmates in California?
Delete Biden Insert TRUMPIE  Projection defined !
really? Biden commercial blaming Trump 4 downplaying Covid? Y’all were calling him racist 4 banning China? Liars! Crooks! Idiots!          -destructive
Would love the see the D Duo focus mostly on their vision for the future. Allude to The Pres not doing his job, but promote what a Biden/Harris Admin WILL do with specifics. Better to invite voters to a more positive outlook.

"'Little Brown Girl': Australian Biden-Harris Cartoon Sparks Furore" by Reuters via NYT
Personally, I can't wait to spend the next 4 years trashing Biden's admin.
I think the Biden/Harris coallition is basically "everyone who doesn't like Donald Trump." That is currently a large group, but it's not very unified, so winning with that coalition will be easier than governing with it.
Voting Green is the right thing to do but unfortunately the Green Party isn't on the ballot here. Biden I guess
I’m obvi gonna be moderately happy if Biden wins in Nov. but that doesn’t change the fact that half the world should burn. If anything the last 4 yrs have only confirmed that Thanos was on the right track.
Yep, this is one scenario/mindset I was worried about. I'd rather the nominees be Trump and Biden. I've dealt with Trump for 1,301 days. At this point, I can deal with him another 159. If he wins, then impeach him.
Buuuut when joe Biden does it??
Literally wrote I’m voting fo Biden in my fb post condemning the DNC and someone had the AUDACITY to say “get Trump out” BITCH OBVIOUSLY BUT WE CAN STILL CRITIQUE CORPORATE INTERESTS IN OUR OWN DAMN PARTY
Who will DEMS pick to top their ticket with upcoming news that Joe Biden will be exiting the ticket/retiring from public office before October 1?

Hey Georgie.  THE DEMS ARE THE LOSERS RIGHT NOW.  No White House, No Senate.  And, KKKamala has incarcerated more black youths than ANY POLITICAL FIGURE, EVER!  EVEN HER POLITICAL SPIN WILL NOT CONVINCE MY BLACK FRIENDS TO VOTE FOR HER TICKET WITH "WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S" BIDEN!

Too many followers. A vote for Trump is a vote for evil. A vote for Biden is a vote for evil and for being a dumb cuck.
Ummm....where is Joe Biden?
No.  The difference is that Trump doesn’t mind if you get rich, too.  Biden does.
Too many what ifs. I'd rather just see the election proceed as it is. That's just me though. Why spend energy on an impeachment when they could spend energy on getting Biden elected?
Mail in voting isn’t new. Trump has made up this narrative and his cult is actually believing it. I’m not a Biden fan either, both of these idiots are unfit for the job
Who the hell is voting for Biden? Like seriously.

Biden, Harris Call For 3-Month Nationwide Mask Mandate
“Having made the necessary act of contrition and profession of the pro-abortion faith, Biden is now in full communion with Harris and the party he leads.” —
The DNC is peak privilege. They think everything is going to be perfect as soon as Trump’s out of office. This fight ain’t over, folks. We will vote for Biden AND hold his administration accountable. Our end game is Big structural change
Nah. The same media puppets who claim Kamala is 1st woc vp candidate also said Kamala was last women candidate when she dropped out &amp; completely ignored the fact Tulsi Gabbard was still in &amp; lasted longer than all but Biden.
Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris Both Support Abortions Up to Birth 😡 Supports Killing Babies “Under Any Circumstance”😡  ABORTRION is MURDER 😡
Find someone’s weak wife to troll hun!  I am NOT the easily persuaded type ! You see! I am an independent woman who survived a perpetrator! I know their kind well! God save us all! Biden isn’t a perp! In fact, our President is one! So f move along ! God save the American women .

This woman's is as bad as Joe Biden. SHE can't put two sentences together she sounds like she can't form a sentence or words what drug or alcohol is she on?
It’ll be funny to see the tweets if Trump gets re-elected. It’ll be horrifying to see the economy and life as we know it if Biden gets elected. I’d prefer to go with seeing tweets about Trump.
Biden is already plotting trying to avoid the presidential debate.
You can leave when Trump loses. Biden-Harris 2020
What’s funny is the other side is saying the exact same thing about Biden. It’s almost like it’s a giant pissing match for who can get the most votes or something...
Remember THESE Kamala Harris moments? | Five videos show why the Biden VP is SO unpopular - Glenn Beck
If you think Trump is doing anything on his own you aren't paying attention. So if he can have Pence/Kuchner/McEnany/Barr/Mnuchin/OAN/FOX there behind him propping him up, then it's perfectly acceptable for Kamala to land some punches if Biden is too classy for that.
LOL, Russia is behind the democrats.   3 1/2 years of investigations showed President Trump was not aligned with Rusdia.  But Clinton and Biden are.

Biden and Harris have to take the spot light of them being so radical left. But they're  not the answer to our problems. President Trump is best person to straighten out our problems. Biden and Harris is the problem. They're no good for our country. Pelosi doesn't  care about you
The photos and images posted of Joe Biden are not true he’s not a paedophile he lost his wife and a child Joe Biden hasn’t gotten over that but he’s actually a good man and a good father he doesn’t teach his children to be evil like Donald Trump and Kamala is good.
Huh. Just around the same time Biden is announcing it should be mandated?
Obama and Biden lost 12 million people in flu epidemic while they were in office. Everyone wants to blame President Trump for virus but not true people wouldn't follow directions that have put out so how can you blame our President? But they want to put the spot light on Trump.
Believers for Biden? Thats an oxymoron.  No shame. How can a believer support the most abortion rights ticket in history? And yet I know some who are supportive of Biden.  I'd be concerned about being asked about it at the judgment seat.
Dude all he does is answer loaded question after question after question. Your bitch biden answers none or has them already pre-determined who gets to ask. We all know why they wont answer, one biden cant formulate a coherent sentence, two they would have to address their lies
george if you give me $20,000 i will stop saying i don’t like biden and harris
Obama/Biden did such a "good job" we decided to elect a civilian business man instead of a politician.
Because we care about incarceration, that's why we presented Biden and Harris.

The left, living in fantasy world, will coo themselves to sleep at night with these posts. According to the commie Dems, Biden and Harris will win, so why worry about impeaching the president?
That means 11 million illegal immigrants computing for american jobs. Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks will be eligible for free healthcare, social security and medicare. WE CAN'T AFFORD JOE BIDEN. WE NEED TO RELECT PRESIDENT TRUMP. He will make America great again.
Joe Biden has dementia but still remembers to hate black people
Biden says if you elect me your taxes are gonna be raised not cut. That means middle  class families, small business, and seniors will pay higher taxes. Biggest tax increase in history 4 trillion dollars. Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks.
I get that Biden and Harris weren't your first choice. Probably not even your second choice. But if you think there's no difference between them and Trump?
You can’t honestly believe that? No amount of fraud can propel Biden to a win.
Hillary’s margin never was this big! I can tell you don’t have a statistics background nor had one class on it ! Bozos are everywhere in the Q family .. We shall see.. We shall see. Biden has always been loved like Obama! Trump is going lose. Mark my words .. R are leaving Trump
There truly is an absolute lack of enthusiasm with Biden - The hope that anti-Trump sentiment will drive the vote, seems to be the angle.
Black Lives Matters &amp; the rest of us want equality in this country why didn't this country's first black president do something to fix racism? Why did Obama pick Biden for his VP? Biden has friends that are members of the KKK and voted to block equality bills. Biden is a racist.
Biden/Harris are for heavy regulation (for climate change), wealth redistribution (heavy taxation aka "economic justice"), globalization (trade agreements that send jobs overseas), continued class warfare, and bailouts for Democratic Party controlled states.
Biden/Harris have been in government for 30+ years. They are part of THE SWAMP. Both of them have enjoyed political power, opulence, and the status their position has given them. During Harris' 30 years public service, and Biden's 44+ years, what actually improved?
We're sorry to hear you've  canceled your subscription, but we had a story about Biden and Harris on page A7 in our national news section:

Unemployment rate in Dec 2015 (Obama/Biden) - 3.5 unemployment rate in Dec 2019 (Trump/Pence) - 5.0 Dow Jones in 2015 - 17,587.03 Dow Jones in 2019 - 28,538.44 GDP in 2015 - 3.9 GDP in 2019 - 4.1 Either Kamala Harris doesn't know how to measure the economy or she is lying.
Hahahahaha! Biden is ahead while staying in Delaware ! I don’t your naïveté to over 160,000 deaths.
They've posted 45 &amp; covid, VP Biden and Sen. Harris, but no Tiffany Cross on YouTube.
Two corporate Democrats with absolutely trash voting records....remind me of 2016. The DNC has told  progressives that they don't need our vote and they never plan on giving us meaningful policy concessions. Biden is against M4A during a pandemic. Trash ticket.
Biden had 50 years to fix America and now wants to complain
Like, Obama and Biden did a great job with the recession we were dealt with and got us out of the gutter. Trump enabled business expansive policies to keep our economy rolling and expanding where it could have easily contracted. Both can be true
are you inciting your cult to do something to Biden? You are one evil woman. Karma will get you.
In my personal opinion, Biden is the better option. But that doesn’t mean he’s not dirty, let’s not treat him like a savior because he’s no where close to perfect.   We’re still screwed no matter what... 🤷🏻‍♂️
Get used to it. This may be the nicest anti Biden Trump ad
Eeks!!! I know Biden is!
I can't believe that some people say that making them wear a mask violates their rights. My question is if it stop the virus then why not? People need to work together regardless. Let's all be safe together. The Biden and Harris will violate your rights!!! Is that what you want?
328 million citizens in the “greatest” country in the world and the best we can do:  Trump v. Biden
Yeah, "just right for Biden" is part of the issue here. They'll be holding hands and skipping while beating black parents over the head and jailing them for truancy.
Yeah, BERNIE is gonna vote for Biden. He didn’t tell anyone else to do that.
Joe Biden is suffering with DEMENTIA so bad he doesn’t even know what State he is in!! However he knows he likes little kids to feel his leg hair, and he touches and kisses every female he comes in contact with, his favs are the 12 and younger grope ah group!
Your right both Barry and Biden have lied for years about it!
Blah blah blah! You Trump suckers are shaking in your boots. She’s a winner and she’s coming after your loser! Biden/Harris 2020!
Bring honesty, class, compassion, and dignity back to the White House!  Vote #BidenHarris
Shouldn't Biden do that?
Maybe Hunter Biden is hiding in Kamala Harris basement 😂😂😂
Not even the pope will help Biden get elected.
Someone is afraid the man Biden can’t debate. We all know Biden is an idiot
I'm not voting for kanye. I was left with no choice in this matter and yes Biden was and is an idiot but at least he's 100% better than that nazi monster.
Hopefully not from the same place as the innocent people she blocked DNA testing against so she could keep her conviction rate up. I’m no trump fan but in the debates, trump will embarrass Biden and Pence will call out her keeping innocent black people in prison
Don’t get on my page slamming Joe Biden anymore because I will block you I’m pissed at Donald Trump he can go fuck hisself I need to be taken care of and every person in my predicament needed to be taken care of he failed me and thousands of others in the United States I’m done
Herman Cain upon hearing Biden's VP pick:
Biden and Harris will not be the  best thing for our country just the opposite. If you want to lose your freedom and be controlled by government you will not like what happens. I hope people will wake up before it to late. Our country survival depends on it. That's a fact.
Kamala Harris will be the one in charge not Biden. We will lose our freedom and everything will be control by the government. Do you really want the most dishonest two people running  our country? God help our country and the people. This country will be no more!!!
Fuck Joe Biden
Man,  has their "spin team" working overtime tonight. You're gonna have to do better than this to make America forget what a joke the Biden campaign is.
To be fair, Bernie didn’t actually tell anyone to vote for Biden if you actually read the article and also watch the video. He says “vote early and vote down the ballot, vote because it matters” or something similar.
Oh My Gosh! For the first time in 3 1/2 years I feel hope! SHAME ON OUR SENATORS!  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 #oklahoma #DumpTrump
I do and Clinton never had the kind of lead Biden has not even close.
Biden Ravine
The TRUMP "freight train over BIDEN" DEBATES WILL DESTROY what remains of Biden's frail psyche!!!
Kamala is a horrible choice-if the goal is to garner 4 million more black votes-as she IS NOT a black voters black person.  Her DA record proves she's anti-black!!!!  Should scrap both Bedridden Biden and Harris; change ticket to Kennedy III/Abrams!!!
Biden should’ve picked Michelle 🥺
To be fair, Biden made up his mind about having a black woman as a running mate before any other qualification. He’s supposed to be a leader. So we hold regular Joes to a higher standard than a presidential candidate?
Ask isis how President Trump coddled them? U know sleepy Joe Biden the Terrorist u and ur buddy Obuma let build up a caliphate and let it keep expanding!🦅🤠🇺🇸
As usual it was full of repetitive nonsense, fear mongering, and promises he can’t keep. Watching that train wreck shortly after the Biden/Harris conference, how can there be an argument about which candidate is fit for the office of POTUS? #TrumpIsNotWell
Just to read "pool report" regarding Biden is SO refreshing!!!!
What in the world? This was clearly not written by Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris Fact of the Day:  Should the Biden-Harris ticket prevail, Kamala, 5’ 2”, would measure as the shortest Vice President ever (by 4 inches).  Shortest VPOTUS 5’ 6” Aaron Burr &amp; Martin Van Boren  Shortest POTUS 5’ 4” James Madison
I'm down to 1  ,,,  My dad  and in our last conversation, he asked if 'not voting Biden is a problem'  *headdesk
So is this how politics work now? Kamala says she believes Biden’s accusers just a few months ago.... and now we ignore all of that because it was just something you say to win? I hate it all. We need better choices.
So what will you be calling Joe Biden? He used the exact same pronunciation that Tucker did.  Or are you a total hypocrite?   And in case you missed it, Tucker was mocking the stridency of the critique, so if you don't take Biden to task with the same vehemency, hypocrite it is.
It turns out that  pronounced Kamala EXACTLY THE SAME as Joe Biden did. Now are you going to go off on Joe with the same vehemence. I doubt it. Hypocrite.
I don’t think Joe Biden will last 4 months in office, before he’s sent to happy acres!

Gasses citizens? Boy talk about lacking context.  You're completely blind to the absurdities of Biden and Harris. Trump isn't close to being a dictator.I am having a rough day.  A rough few days. I can't understand how people can spread BS that they really don't know is true,  and ignore the 🐘 in the room. 45 is an admitted womanizer.  He has more connections to Epstein than anyone.  Yet I see people saying Biden is a pedo.
Suck it up and vote blue. No 3rd party candidate stands a chance, so a vote for anyone else is = a Trump vote. We aren't voting for Biden. We're voting for the people who will come in and make a difference.
I said no, as I’m not kamilla and Biden.  is the better choice. Screw both sides of the swamp lady.
Trump arguably ran one of the strongest economies that we’ve experienced until 4 months ago when this pandemic started world wide.   Democrats also pushed hard for the economy to close but apparently it’s now Trumps fault it took a hit. Biden’s campaign is honestly just a 🤡 show
VP Biden and Senator Harris, have just called for a nationwide mask mandate, while not wearing a mask. They answered a total of 0 questions from reporters after their remarks.
We’ll take the Biden bus but when we reach the end of the line, we will go the rest of the way on foot because there is no bus to a better world.  Those routes have not been laid yet.
Now I know that  is posting all this as an interview for a Biden administration job, which will be sad for all of us.
He must be applying for a job in a Biden administration.
I have a good feeling that he will get one from Biden. Stood up to a corrupt administration and it ruined him. We need to make him whole.
Wow, man. I didn't accuse the previous presidents of being pedophiles. I could with Clinton, because there is evidence. Same with Biden. But I don't have anything on Obama, Bush Sr, W, Reagan, Nixon, etc. I was merely mentioning that prior administrations didn't attack the Cabal.
Fox News is reporting  chances of beating Joe Biden is 29% at this exact time in the race against Hillary in 2016 Trump's chances of beating Hillary was also 29% That speaks volumes! #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica #Trump2020LandslideVictory #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
I agree!! Goosebumps and actual tears in my eyes! Biden-Harris I'm with you!!
Please help the Biden campaign decide which poster is the best!
Great idea!! Every dedicated public servant whose career has been ruined after decades of hard work by “Silver Spoon” Trump, I want to be reemployed by the Biden administration. F Trump.
Hats off to  for receiving five big Pinocchio's! #WalkAway #WalkAwayFromDemocrats

How Kamala Harris Became Biden’s VP Pick | WSJ  via
Joe Biden then and now, the Joe you think you know isn't the one running for president!
I had a thought Kamala Harris would be a smart, right and strategic choice as running mate for Biden a few months ago; Biden exactly did what I had thought. I am also foreseeing the US getting female president after eight or a few more than eight years, if not earlier.
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed Joe Biden's sexual assault accusers? That was after she called Joe Biden a racist. Phony Kamala.
Favorite quote of the day  nailed it she said  ticket is too far left for even the Reverend Jeremiah wright! She's right Biden Harris wouldn't just bring the chickens home to roost they would bring them home to kill them! #WalkAway  #WalkAwayFromDemocrats
I just personally believe it’s our civic duty to vote and I can’t continue to watch our environment be destroyed, so I’m thrilled with Biden and Bernies environmental plan
Yes team Biden has already printed up the campaign posters! 😂😂
The Biden campaign must have had knowledge of who  was going to pick for his running mate because they didn't waste any time rolling out the new slogan!
Okay twitter fam - how do we feel about Biden picking Kamala Harris for VP? #VPPick
I mean sure, it sucks, but the alternative is Trump. Whereas Biden MAYBE, MAAAYYYYBE, might listen to a left leaning base, and has (albeit half-assed) a more leftward platform, Trump is just gonna send federal agents to throw us in vans.
Ah yes, not wanting Trump again is "rewarding" Biden, yes.
I'm still going to hate vote for Biden/Harris, because another 4 years of Trump is not what this country needs, but we cannot just go back to the slightly left of center status quo with Biden and Harris.  The system gotta go, and be replaced with a better one
Biden didn't pick Klobuchar because of her terrible history as a prosecutor, so he chose Kamala Harris, someone with an equally bad history as a prosecutor.  Very cool
“I believe Biden’s accusers”
"Her tenacious pursuit of justice and relentless advocacy for the people is what is needed right now."
If/When Joe Biden wins, you’ll be looking at Kamala Harris, First Woman President within 4-8 years.
me reading that Biden picked Harris as his running mate
Come on Kamala Harris. Let the narc be Biden’s VP.
More leftist hypocrisy. Right up there with “you can keep your health insurance” and “ they didn’t build that”
Nope. What if one or two are controversial picks? The VP pick will take enough heat, never mind an entire cabinet. The GOP is looking for ANY reason to cast doubt on the strength of Biden’s candidacy. Let’s not give it to them.
You must be blind. Trump will smoke Biden. Cry for another 4 years. #OBAMAGATE
100% chance that Mr. Biden is going to need that "I can't believe I have to say this" thing at the debates
Just saw a Biden commercial.  Lame.  It will only sell to the lemmings.
Cleaning up the 💩💩💩 from 45 will take some time. And of course, what is left of the GOP will be never-ending obstruction and heckling of Biden’s admin - their favorite sport.
Things we see on Facebook-”Trump to sign Executive order to protect God from Biden attack!” #Biden2020 #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsALaughingStock #Vote2020 #BlueWave2020
Yes. Trump was mentioned by name is the case documents for Epstein’s trial and a child says he was one of the men to rape her on that island. Biden is not perfect. He’s not my first pick but I won’t vote for monsters.
Classic  spin! Barely mention what should be bombshell for Biden campaign, then spin it to attack how   responded to the gaff. Where are the hard hitting questions to  about his racist attitude that all blacks are the same? #NoJoe2020
I am White and attend an HBCU and I am voting for Biden! #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
If Donald Trump asked a black journalist if he took a “cocaine test” it would be wall to wall coverage of him being racist.  But Joe Biden said it so he gets a pass.
Dude... I know people don’t like Trump and he’s said dumb things... but I really feel like Biden is just as bad.Cheaper to make there, hopefully the Chinese will prehack the machines to only vote Biden as revenge for the tariffs.
If you unironically support Biden/Harris then you are definitely not a leftist lol
Kinda like the USPS Union endorsing Biden ??   Nothing suspicious there, right?
I’m glad to hear Biden won’t fall off the earth, it’s trump that I want to fall off the earth. Silly bot.
Not true I couldn’t stand your ass but decided to vote for you because I saw Hillary as corrupt. Joe Biden doesn’t have that problem. I’m voting joe and I’ve never voted dem for President. #byeDon
You are missing the point. Biden is the biggest hypocrite in politics. 47 years proves this.
Has Joe Biden given anyone a sit-down interview?
You listen to Biden and like him ? Feel sorry yes , like not a chance
Bingo and many I think are ignorant on purpose. Some ive talked too truly believe Obama/Biden left Trump with nothing to fight virus. They're dumb

She says it like it is! Biden is a racist from the deep states hold lies and hides in his basement
She only spoke the truth to Biden when she said he was racist
If only Biden would answer...sometime.
You’re right. The a President seems to have learned his lesson. As for Biden , guess he didn’t learn from being VP...
Why is Biden talking so slow now???
“Trump then said that Biden is "playing politics" by turning the virus into a campaign talking point.”  Um, what? The pandemic is the main talking point.
Trump takes questions from a biased leftish media DAILY and Biden can’t for even a minute?? Tells ya something. #Landslide2020

and this is why anyone is voting DEM is really voting for Harris because I doubt hardly anyone would put money that Biden could make it 4 years
If Biden can do it, why not Herman Cain?
Watch Biden during Thomas’ Confirmation Hearings. Pays Hill to lie, then dumps on her! Dems are a crock of snakes - always have been!
Giuliani has been quiet for so long you know he's up to no good, doing tRumps bidding. And, yes, they've probably found some miniscule issue with Biden that they've created &amp; manipulated into some great HOAX to defame his character &amp; integrity.   WE THE PEOPLE WILL NOT BE BAITED.
I have literally hated Biden after what he pulled at the Confirmation Hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas. He dug up Anita Hill then dumped on her as well.  A loud-mouth, liar, thief. One term would have been one term too many! Shameful!

That’s promising. Saw one sign of Joe Biden during the Primaries in West Texas
Graham is deep state and running the clock hoping for a Biden victory
How Biden rode into VP Office on the coattail of Obama is suspect - he didn’t lend a thing to the campaign. He was disliked by his party!  Perhaps he learned Blackmailing #101 skills from the Clintons and will pass them on to his VEEP choice, as if the bitch needs advice on vice!
Actually, by not voting for Trump I’m helping Biden get elected

If Biden becomes president our world will change dramatically and we will go into a recession like you’ve never seen . Everything about him is bullshit here’s proof   .......it goes to his website ......god help us ....Trump 2020
My two cents... Biden/Heiress 20 is joke..how the hell does they not say anything about condemning the  riots,rioters? It’s their followers burning down the cities!!!  wins in a landslide over these two communists

She endorsed Biden. Months ago.
Ok man, if you think that Biden has a sudden change of heart in the last four years and isn’t just committed to the same neoliberal garbage that he always has been then that’s no skin off my nose
If Biden was serious he’d pack the court, but he won’t 4. Again, doubt it 5. ACA is garbage anyways, M4A is the only viable healthcare plan and Biden isn’t touching it with a 10 foot pole 6. Doubt it 7. He has attempted several times over his career to slash SS
Shows what kind of "Catholic " Biden is.  Pro-Abortion with a Anti-Catholic VP pick.
But getting rid of Trump is utterly pointless if we’re replacing him with Joe fucking Biden. It’s useless. It doesn’t matter.
Neither Biden nor Kamala was my first pick, but I’ll take them over Cheeto Face any day
But Biden isn’t going to do anything to roll back any of Trump’s shit, and he’s just gonna be a repeat of the Obama presidency and give us someone even worse than Trump after. Biden doesn’t offer a viable alternative to Trump. This election is pointless
I get it. A vote for Biden means one vote less for Trump. I do not want another 4 years under a Trump Presidency. But you CANNOT ignore what these politicians are doing just because they aren't Trump
I'm optimistic actually. Biden is personally pretty moderate, but his platform will be the most progressive in American history.  More than anything, I'm looking forward to having a cabinet of people who are even vaguely qualified.
oh well im not voting because biden sucks just as bad as Trump does
Bold of you to assume Biden cares about kids in cages
Joe Biden isn’t going in the direction I want
If the country belongs to all of us, does that mean you and Biden will change these outdated, barbaric man made laws? Freedom is what the people want. We want to self determine and not be told what to do or how to live our lives. We want to be able to live in #Peace

#NEWS: Joe Biden picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party presidential ticket. Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is one of the party's most prominent figures.
You think trying to paint Biden as a racist when he literally put an African American woman on the ticket is weak man.  Your downfall is you’re just attacking this time. No vision no plans for a 2nd term besides more cultural wars and more division. No thanks #biden/Harris
I’m curious if this is still true.
Wanna bet it made Biden look ‘presidential’ for the first time?
Hoe Biden didn't pick Harris, the Deep State did!
Reade has been proven to be a liar. Her ex never said it was Biden and her friends have abandoned her because she’s a liar and psychotic obviously.
He never said it was Biden.
You do realize Joe Biden has accusations as well? There is no good person on either side. Don’t fool yourself into thinking the DNC is untarnished. The party of the KKK vs. the party of Lincoln.
Is it okay if we admit this race is really between  and  ?  How long after Biden’s president do they invoke the 25th? And they wouldn’t be wrong.
Even if you think Biden would do anything to create effective change, which he won’t (and you’re deluded if you think otherwise), we don’t fucking have time for two slow steps. People are dying and the country is hurling towards catastrophe. We don’t have time for gradualism
Kamala Harris is Biden’s running mate?  Joe will be excited when he finds out...
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.

Not as weird as Trump /joe debate. Biden won’t know where he is at.
You’re welcome! Yeah I just kinda don’t wanna exist that much anymore. The whole Biden presidency certainly hasn’t helped
Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Kamala call Biden a racist no more than 6 months ago? I guess it’s like Ted Cruz kissing Trump’s ass even though he called his wife ugly.
Trump2020 best president ever!!.biden and Harris.going under Trump2020
Well considering Biden isn’t a rapist...
So you think Biden groped children?
You appear to lack any real human empathy. However, you will probably be a one term potus. Biden could be too, if elected. But please, sir, get some help. Much of America cares about you....it just didn't work out long-term, and you deserve to get well. So do we.  🙏🏼♥️🇺🇸
Hilarious, a 14 month old article. “Seven of the women said Biden's behavior did not amount to sexual harassment or assault.” We now know Tara reade is a lying lunatic.
great pick!  She is going to be a thorn in the gop’s side!  She’ll light up mike pence’s dumbass in a debate!  She’s going to be a hellcat to that lame ass administration. Go Biden/Harris!  Let’s kick some ass in November!

Can’t find a video on Trump using the N-Word, but we have Biden saying it in Congress.  And you guys support him. Good luck.
Joe Biden will be waking up from his nappy time and prepare for the big announcement.
your article about pressure mounting for Biden to pick a black woman as a VP – I would like to hear more of this. It makes a lot of sense to me. I was not going to vote for a vanilla ticket, I will, but distastefully. But I believe  sees America now.
Perhaps because it was an accurate description.  Attempting to overthrow the duly elected president. Basis for impeachment was paid for and supported by Hillary, Obama, and Biden.
Whomever Biden picks as VP will be running the country shortly after inauguration   Joe will be resting quietly in the basement
It matters Democrats want that lie spread because if Biden wins he will be removed for medical reasons and his VP will be president
If Trump is so stupid....then why is Biden trying to duck the debates?
I love Mayor Pete but he's be a miserable VP choice for Biden. Hope he lands some spot in the administration though.
Biden is being deliberative. I much prefer that than be rushed like the current moron in the white housed

Give Biden the same amphetamines they’re fight Trump. I’m tryna see somethin’
If  does not pick a woman of color as his VP pick, I will not vote for Biden. I will not vote for tRump either, but I will have lost all enthusiasm for him to be far seeing, and being in touch with the people. I will stay home. We’ll never see change.
Sen. Ron Johnson denies getting dirt on Biden from Ukrainian lawmaker, blasts Blumenthal for 'twisting' classified briefings        Blumenthal is a pathetic pathological liar 🤥🤥🤥🤥AND a DimmWit!
What up Josh? I agree with you. When Michelle Obama said " we go high when they go low" is played out. GOP don't play fair, and neither should Dems. Yep can't get it twisted. Republicans 4 Biden are still Rethuglicans.
Preach!! Yes  and these other right wing groups supporting Biden, hate Trump. That's where it ends. After Trump they'll continue to vote and back conservatives. You're one of the few I've heard talking about this.

So, Biden gets a pass on rape charges by former employee. You will not bring up all the times Biden placed his hands &amp; lips inappropriately on numerous women. He’s a creep.  Your other close Dem Friend, Bill Clinton, flew w/ Epstein to his private island to hv sex with minors.
You repeating the lies about Biden just prove how irrelevant you are to  the conversation.
Question...is Biden really going to be the Democrat nominee??? That’s why he’s not knocking on doors. Who would their nominee be? Sanders? AOC? Michelle Obama? Oprah? It could be anyone.
He works 24 hrs a day while Biden sits in his basement with his handlers.
Biden can’t even string a coherent sentence together. A debate would be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. I hope it happens and I’ll have my popcorn ready.
What he is trying to say here is that Mr Biden has painted himself into a very tiny corner. Rice, as bad as she is, may be the best of a very pathetic selection.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
Joe Rogan thinks that *Joe Biden* has more severe dementia than fucking drumpf?! This man is a serious idiot. If you listen to him, you should question your life choices.

Biden rides a bike, wears a mask, has a sense of humor, and just owned a fox reporter. Seems okay to me.

This was literally in the Affordable Care Act. Biden called it a BFD when it passed. Let's make Biden president.
Anna Navarro is a “big get” for Team Obama (I didnt know Obama was seeking 3rd term 😱) like Rush Limbaugh is a big get for Trump.  Just another example of media cheerleading for Biden.🙄
Annnnndddd....that excuses Biden bein' a big ole racist???
Literally none of that ever happened. They are baseless accusations and no matter how many times they're tossed about, it does not make them true. Biden PROVES his racism and pedophilia ON CAMERA constantly. SMH #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Biden’s senile. We don’t need Russia to tell us that. We can watch the videos.  That’s why they’re hiding him in the basement.

You repeating the garbage about “Biden has dementia” just proves you don’t actually know anything.
At this point Biden could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I would still vote for him.
They only ever loved him for what they could get with the Biden name. They’ve all got to get what they can before he’s declared “no use” to them by China and Ukraine, right Hunter!
He is definitely declining. I’m pretty sure they have Biden locked in the house like people have to do with Alzheimer’s family members. Sad!
Yes, elder abuse! Mueller was just the face of that BS, just like Biden is the face now. What’s scary is -who’s pulling the puppet’s strings?!
Yes, where are the people that are supposed to love him? His wife, obviously she is cruel! Jill Biden is a poor excuse for a wife. Sad and disgusting!
Why did the audience clap at the town hall meeting several months ago when he called the guy “fatty” for just asking about Hunter Biden and his enriching himself off of his Biden name?
His wife is a terrible person to do that to him. Shame in Jill Biden.
He’s always gotten by with his BS gift. Gift jo more, just dementia. Shame on Jill Biden, what a b*tch for a wife. Power hungry!
Jill Biden can’t rest until she’s FLOTUS. It’s shameful, disgusting, and sad to watch. They have plenty of money to retire and go away. She’s a cruel wife!
No, it’s not funny, it’s disgusting, and it’s horrifying to watch Jill Biden march Joe Biden out into public for her own benefit, has she no shame?! Terrible!
You, Jill Biden, should be protecting your husband since he is obviously experiencing dementia possibly Alzheimer’s, instead of of parading him in public for your own power grab. Shameful!
Anyone who thinks joe Biden wrote this is naive to a fault. Arguing that he even read it is a stretch...
Biden doesn’t make you cry? Seriously? What are you not paying attention to?
So what? Trump never accepted the endorsement. The premier of the CCP endorses Biden. But I'm sure you're proud of that.
If Biden really can defeat God, we should probably vote for him cause he'd be the biggest badass in politics.

1.) Sippy is wrong on face here; any vote that isn’t affirmatively for Biden is a vote for Trump and all of the failure and cruelty and fascism that comes with that; but  2.) you click the link and I actually agree with her; so  3.) the answer is to never click the link.
Biden did do deliberately
Yeah if there went 20+ other examples of Biden "mistakenly" making racists racist statements.  I mean the guy didn't want to live in the jungle with black people

I think Trump has slipped some from when he was younger like most people once they get into their 70s. But Biden is much worse.  He's approaching full blown senile.

Help me understand. You withhold your vote from Biden to send a message to the DNC. But is it fair to say it wasn’t the DNC that choose Biden but the voters? Does it send the same message to the voters? What’s the end game? Sincerely asking.
I am not the one to reply to those saying who do I vote for?   That requires an amount of patience I simply don’t have.   To me it’s so obvious, &amp; you asking angers me.  I need to work on this. I don’t give a flip if you hate Trump, and dislike Biden. Get over it!
If people actually cared about having a politician "reduce harm" more people would have acted said no to Biden and forced him to dropout and have Dem endorse somebody else. Unfortunately people didn't, and won't, do that because of this whole rhetoric.
Joe Biden says if he’s President, we’ll be joined by the hip with WHO.
Imagine being so privlaged that you could settle for Biden.
So you forgive BIDEN for all of the bad things he said, did, and voted for that were negative toward POC, but this guy you won’t?  Hypocrisy at it’s finest.
These people are out liars. They have called him every name in the book. The American people just dont believe them. Biden has been an empty suit and been running for President his whole life.
Just a few short months ago Kamala Harris said she believed the six women that accused Biden of improperly touching them. That was “before” she was handed the VP spot. Also intimated in the debates he was a racist.  Now all is good?  Politics.
Patriots, &amp; those that don’t riot, don’t kill cops, don’t burn the American flag, don’t worship China &amp; Russia. Believe in borders. Believe Biden is a wishy washy career political hack now worth millions as a “public servant”. Socialism doesn’t uphold Democracy. It usurps it.

I've been really worried to say this for a while now, and I don't know why - I guess it's a fear of Trump winning the presidency again for 4 years, but.. I'm terrified of Biden/Harris as well... I don't like this feeling.  I feel like a cornered animal right now.  What do we do?
Trump AND Biden?
In an earlier discussion of divisions within the Dem Party, Klein and Yglesias (more or less correctly) note a divide between e.g. Biden and Harris, on the one hand, and, e.g., Sanders, Warren, and AOC, on the other, over how committed they are to our political system as such.
If Trump’s a racist, he’s sure a piss poor one. Now Biden....
Delaware, how many big banks have HQ in Delaware. All show anyway because big banks will be big donors to Biden/Harris. Obviously they aren’t too tough on them. Al, show, no substance.
Learn history Ed. A larger  gov’t makes people smaller.  You’re for a larger Federal Gov’t. It usurps freedom and civil liberties from “the people”. 1A rights already in trouble, censoring dissenting opinion. Now we hear that Biden-Harris will enact Assault Rifle confiscation.
I am thrilled with  but also would have been very happy with any of the candidates on Biden’s short list. When I get down about the future of US, I think about the many honest and capable people in office right now. Our future is bright once we get past Trump era.
Also she literally can’t even get presidency if something happens to Biden because she was born and raised in a foreign country that means her Secretary of State would become president via Nancy Pelosi
Elizabeth Warren strongly supports the Biden-Harris ticket.  As does AOC, fwiw. Real Warren Dems don't try to reelect Trump.
How many employees has Joe Biden paid $20 an hour?
Joe Biden has 8 years to figure this out and many more years in other roles in government. He has had his opportunity. Go be creepy somewhere else Uncle Joe.
Wrong. 1. The majority of progressives voted for Democrats &amp; are part of the base, so disregarding them for Republicans is foolish. 2. AOC stated that in any other country besides the U.S. Biden &amp; her would be in different parties, because of the differences in policies they hold

Oh ok!! I was looking under collections then the Biden Harris collection.
I think they’re wanting a Biden-Harris one. But that’s also a good option!!
Love them. Biden Harris 2020!
This is such common sense. Just now i had a flash of resentment that the Dems (Incl Biden/Harris) didn’t do this when they were last in power. But then I remembered a Senate anachronism called the “Filibuster”. That needs to go. Day One.
I do think that Warren can get more done as, say Sec of Treasury than as VP.  It will be very interesting to see what Biden's cabinet looks like.
Well put. Kamala was far from my first choice (for president or VP), but she was also far from my last. If Biden had made his choice before George Floyd's murder, my guess is it would have been Klobuchar, and that would have been terrible.
Biden and Harris are not as progressive as the folks I'd have most liked to see on the ticket, but progressives who are responding to Harris getting the nod by denouncing Biden and Harris aren't just arguing against the Democratic ticket, they're arguing against Warren and AOC.
My hope is Beto is in the Biden cabinet if they win

After listening to Biden and Harris, Trump just looks and sounds like a paranoid, crazy, angry old man.
Nah Biden is his equal. Only thing is he actually has experience. Vote for libertarian
It started with more voters pulling the lever for Biden than for any of the progressive alternatives. Until we on the left of the party can convince more voters to support our candidates, the corporate donors will keep getting their candidates on the ticket.
Voting for anyone besides Biden is a vote for Trump, and a vote for Trump is a vote for racism, hate, queerphobia, etc. It is what it is, don’t vote 3rd party.

I always wondered what I was missing? Find me someone who can tell me she isn’t a better candidate to beat Trump than Biden or Bernie
So, are we just going to ignore the fact that Biden just picked a VP candidate that believes he is a racist. And stands with his sexual assault accusers?
Can we honestly hold this against her if we don’t hold Biden accountable for his alleged pedophelia or Trump for his supposed philandering?
I will be voting for Biden. I do want safety for my children and all children, with affordable housing and programs to help those who are struggling. I want my children to grow up safe AND compassionate, working as a community to insure everyone can live a happy, healthy life.

I guess I’ll hold my nose and vote for Biden and Harris, but Jesus what a grim state of affairs.   Eventually the constant capitulation to the right by Democrats is going to result in even more dangerous right-wingers like Tom Cotton having a shot at POTUS, and that’s terrifying
You hear it a lot: "I like Joe Biden because he is a moderate."  Biden just chose a VP candidate that has a more progressive voting record than the "radical" leftist/socialist/Marxist Bernie Sanders.
I’m sorry if that sounded rude or short. Im not feeling well right now and I apologize. When the Biden camp says he wants a woman of color as his VP, that screams AA. They aren’t looking for the best, they’re pandering for votes.
The vote is going to be so close that any vote not for Biden, is a vote for Trump. A libertarian is not going to swing enough votes their way to win. Sorry.

So is ok if Biden is racist and sexist. We’re to overlook that. Got it.
Ultimately polls and poll analysis shouldn't affect what we do or what the outcome is. I'll certainly do what I can (campaign at a distance, donate, vote) to help Biden win. What percentage chance you or I or Nate Silver thinks Biden has of winning is not of great consequence. 4/
Polling is imperfect. Poll analysis more so. But both are better than your or my gut feeling that "Biden is doing twice as well as Hillary on her best day." 3/
Now Trump, again, has a very small chance of winning. But, again, most folks don't want to / can't manage to think probabilistically about this. So, again, we want to deny what we can actually say about the likelihood of Trump or Biden winning. 2/
Apparently there is a 1.5% chance that Biden dies before Inauguration Day
I stayed out of the Veep Wars bec: 1) it's the Vice goddam Presidency; 2) only one person gets to pick the VP nominee and that one person was and is Joe Biden, so arguing about it on Twitter is a total waste of time; 3) they seemed almost designed to drive wedges between Dems. 5/
Like me, the vast majority of Bernie primary voters in 2016 voted for Hillary in November. And, of course, the vast majority of Warren Democrats will be voting for Biden/Harris. And many of us will be working to make sure they win. Because it's damn important. 3/
I love that you're discounting the fact that Biden is Catholic while SIMULTANEOUSLY counting his presence as a Catholic on the 2008 and 2012 Democratic tickets.  10/10, very Christian of you
Heard of Tara Reade? How about when Biden’s own VP candidate said he was a racist?
Joe Biden picking a moderate VP candidate so Republicans don't call her a far-left radical
Shouldn't you be phone-banking for Biden/Harris? Don't you want them to win? Get to work, buddy.
It’s funny how Kamala Harris called Biden racist now she is his VP, I wonder if that question will ever come up, probably not though because she is a democrat and it’s not part of the mainstream media’s narrative that something like that ever happened
So Biden has the American Communist Party endorsing him and now the Chinese Communist? Whose next Kim Jong-Un and Nicklas Maduro?  Sure glad Joe’s a “moderate”.  I get it, Joe’s a “moderate” Communist. Not a hard core one.
If Biden wins, we know who the first female President will be.
I’m still stuck on her saying that Biden isn’t a better option than trump
Kamala Harris Is the Future, So Mike Pence May Well Be History
The progressive wing of the party lost the nomination and we need to figure out how to win it next time, but throwing a fit and taking our toys and going home accomplishes nothing. The policy concessions Biden's made to Warren and Sanders are worth more than the Vice Presidency.
That loud minority of my fellow #WarrenDemocrats who would've been enthusiastic about a Biden-Warren ticket but who now denounce the entire Democratic Party needs to rethink their politics.  You know who _is_ enthusiastic about Biden-Harris?
But Biden’s ok? Guess that’s what watching CNN and MSDNC get your. Certainly not the news. They show you clips of him 5 years ago.  There’s a very good reason he’s always hiding.
Cognitive dissonance? Yes, Biden shows that all the time.
When you reach 60, most physicians give you a memory test of some kind routinely. If you were older, you would know that.  Compared to Biden, Trump has perfect memory. Either you haven’t heard Joe ( I know the media’s been covering for him) or you are in denial, Joe has dementia.
Some Trumper just tried to argue that since Harris lost badly in the Democratic primaries, Biden choosing her for VP has "shown blatant disregard to the American voters" by picking her.  Seriously. 🙄
Sure, lots to list. Only have so many digits. A Biden Presidency would be a disaster. He’s sold out to Bolshevik Bernie. Good luck convincing America that he’s a moderate now. And wasn’t that the reason he was selected in the first place, Biden wasn’t a radical?
I’m voting for more than just Biden and Harris. I’m voting for the government they’ll build.

Trump stopped flights from China on 1/31 before one person in US had died. Biden called him xenophobic for doing so. Makes you wonder how much longer it would have taken Joe to stop flights?  Dr Fauci said that Trump’s early response saved thousands of lives.
I’m pretty sure she locked up tons of people as a federal prosecutor for pot, then went on a radio show and bragged about how she smoked it in college while listening to snoop and dre, who weren’t making music when she was in college. Oh and she called Biden a sexual predator 🤷🏻‍♂️
You’re not paying attention. Biden adopted most of Crazy Bernie’s Socialist platform. The Party can’t get to Socialism fast enough. Many liberals will have some soul searching to do before they vote for this radical ticket.
People have been criticizing the length of BIden's VP process, but there's a pretty good chance that if he'd selected his running mate back when Sanders conceded (that is, before George Floyd's murder), he may well have picked Klobuchar, who'd have been much worse than Harris.
The president of the USA is projecting when he says Biden committed treason. Horrible thing to accuse anyone of, particularly when the accuser has committed treason, or so it would appear. But I agree with you, Trump is profoundly vile and dangerous. He needs to be removed NOW.
And you’re voting for Biden? Trump is Einstein compared to Joe Biden.
The systemic issues that plague our country will continue to persist if we do not hold every single individual operating under these systems to a higher standard. I will vote for Biden but you must have me fucked up if you think I’m not gonna trash his uninspired status-quo bs.
The DNC &amp; Biden guaranteed that I will NEVER vote for Biden.  Fuck the DNC!
Should be hard for the Trumpettes to criticize her on "law and order" grounds since she is a former DA. I think she will bring some unique perspectives to the ticket that will be much appreciated during these turbulent times.  I am so happy with Biden's selection of Kamala!
I don’t hate her, I will likely vote for her and biden, however, her character hurts me.

Less than two years ago Biden said “the poor kids are just as bright as the white ones” and somehow I’m supposed to believe he’s socialy progressive.

Of course, in 2020, in the middle of the BLM protests, crime bill author Biden picks the cop.
Biden/Harris huh? I guess at this point lmao
Now get those Biden harris sticks printed so I can slap one somewhere
I’m fine with it. Warren was the best choice, but Harris is ok. She’s not the worst person out there, and sures up a bunch of Biden’s problems
I knew that if Joe Biden picked a Black woman as his running mate, she would represent the top 1% just as well as any white woman ever could.
I didn't think Biden would choose the actual worst VP candidate but here we are
It’s Kamala. I’m good with that.
She literally sold T-shirts attacking Biden’s history on race during the primaries.   How the turntables
I am perfectly fine with Harris as the VP choice. Then again, I'd have been perfectly fine with any of the VP candidates who Biden was considering. It's just the Vice Presidency.
I am* Biden's VP pick.  DM for interviews.
As long as Biden isn't picking Bass, we're good.  Hard pass on throwing away Florida from the get-go.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a lot of Obama administration veterans (e.g. the crowd behind Crooked Media) have expressed a preference for Rice. Their voices are pretty easily amplified. But I don't necessarily expect their preferences to make that much difference to Biden.
Agreed.  But also seems like there's an effort to make stuff meaningful that's pretty minor.  There's not a whole lot of change in the WI polls.
Everyone is trying to coax out something meaningful in pretty minor changes.  I'm more interested in what's up with the Emerson poll showing Biden only +2 in MN.
Everyone when the Biden team tells us to “text ‘First’ to 30330”
Though I'll give partial credit to VP Selection Process concern trolls who base their concern on the fact that these are extraordinary times so Biden should not follow a perfectly normal VP selection process. At least they admit that nothing out of the ordinary is going on here.
Veepstakes Speculation Twitter is among the emptiest Twitters. And the emptiest genre of Veepstakes Speculation Twitter is concern-trolling Biden's utterly unremarkable (beyond the promise to select a woman) VP selection process.
Do you think “Mother” will have to be next to Pence when he debates the female VP that Biden chooses?
what do you think about biden then since he’s a catholic?
I’d like to think positive. Biden isn’t giving me much hope. They need to debate.
What a totally deceived &amp; evil statement! The opposite is true. Being a true Christian &amp; supporting the Biden doctrine is impossible. #Trump2020Landslide
Big deal! Trump is sharp as a tack! I wouldn’t trust demented Biden to watch my dog!
I wouldn’t trust Biden to watch my dog!!! The man is demented! Give me a break. Stop watching #FAKENEWSCNN
Did I miss the Biden/Imminent press conference?
Any reporting Joe by you or MSDNC of Ukraine prosecutors listing Joe Biden as a “criminal suspect” in the firing of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin? Whether you agree with it or not, the fact that Biden is makes it newsworthy right? Why is negative Biden news ignored?
Joe Biden confidently explaining that a gay is basically a woman, so he's kept his promise.
It cost money on my phone to text biden. They ask me for money daily
We need more than a new FBI building,  we NEED new FBI agents! Ones that will honor their oaths and never turn against their own country and people, like  the ones under Obama and Biden did.
Whatever Trump has said, next to Biden he will look like a Nuclear Physicist.  Isn’t there some “Elder abuse” laws that should protect Joe from such exploitation? Poor man.
Biden said that? That’s pretty good for him. He’s said that Covid has killed 125 million Americans, that 150 million Americans have been killed by firearms since 2007, and that he’s running for the US Senate. Dementia is a dreaded disease.
He's working for free! He donates all his pay checks to charities. It's the people like Biden that have made fortunes off of stealing from the American people.  Made his entire family rich too. Selling America out to China!
ACA punished people for being poor. One of less than 5 good Trump deeds was wiping out that mandate. Biden wants to bring it back.
Did you catch what Biden said about blacks the other day? Said they had w/few exceptions, no diversity of thought, unlike Latinos. Just one racist in the race, and it ain’t Trump.
He speaks fine. I’d put him up against Obama any day, w/o teleprompters. And Biden?  oh my. I think Joe’s going for the sympathy vote.
Biden was announced at 2 am
Folks, I gotta come clean: its me. I've been catfishing Joe Biden pretending to be Elizabeth Warren's 3rd cousin Barbara Little Bear for almost 2 years now and now I'm the vice president
Biden/McGraw 2020.
BIDEN PICKED BRIAN KELLY AS HIS VP!?!?!?
I don’t care who he picks. All are good choices. I’m voting Biden 2020.
GOP racist for calling out Marxist cop killers, rioters?Dems running a racist Joe Biden for President. Trump will get record number of blacks voting for him this fall. Dems  give them terrible schools, bad neighborhoods, no future, no hope. Been doing it for yrs.  Nothing changes
That’s great for Biden, but where will you be giving your concession speech? I don’t want to miss it.
Another county for your Election Night watchlist is Cherokee. If Cherokee swings towards the Dems in any meaningful way (around 42% or so), rural Okla may swing a little, too.  No, Biden isn't winnning Coal Co, but it may help show the decrease in votes for the Pres we expect.
However, with this in mind, if Biden really is 6-8% ahead in Okla Co... the 4 Democratic candidates for County office are almost certainly going to win.  Election night - for Pres - might not be exciting statewide but seeing how Biden is doing in Okla Co is going to be the story.
Joe Biden-Roger Stone unity ticket
If Biden had been, it would have been higher. Those “experts” that you deem always right early on predicted a death toll of 2 Million from Covid.I don’t recall Republicans blaming Obama for Swine Flu. Shows you how diabolical the Dems are. They wanted a recession to get rid of DT
Sorry but Trump disassociated himself from Epstein, unlike Clinton and others. Have you not see the creepy photos of Biden and kids?
We have enough voters who elected Biden as VP who can elect him as POTUS. Just gotta make sure they show up!   #votelouder
If you do this for what the true percentage of white, college educated voters will likely be, it's Biden +9. Still a healthy lead, but +13 is kinda the equivalent of figuring a batting average that excludes at bats where the batter struck out.
For a press conference? Hardly. You are kidding yourself if you think Biden doesn’t have serious dementia. The media is dishonest for covering it up. Biden’s hiding.
Oh, ok, giving the eulogy at Dem Sen Robt Byrd in 2010, a former  Klansman is not racist? Biden’s ‘94 Crime Bill put thousands of blacks in prison.Biden talks down to blacks, that is a form of racism. Be glad to compare what DT has done for blacks, versus 8 yrs of Obama-Biden.
And Biden gets a teleprompter at his last presser.
Joe Biden and real leadership?
“It shows, once again, that this election is all about Trump. And for as much as he tries to make it a choice between him and Biden, for this group, it’s a referendum.”
Biden has a lot less gaffes so that’s why so many Dems are advising him to stay in his bunker and not debate?  Right.

Robin Williams' decade-old comedy bit about 'rambling' Joe Biden goes viral after Democratic candidate's gaffes
Biden finally picked his VP
Go to bed Simone no one cares what you say biden has been in bed for hours
You were an baffoon on Steve Hilton... you are angry you were fired, there was nothing your said that said Biden was better... sry you are a joke!
And CNN, MSDNC, ABC, CBS AND NBC are apologists and defenders of everything Democrat. With 90% of the media acting as an arm of the DNC, your concerns about Fox are laughable. Be glad to count the pro Biden Dems on Fox versus pro-Trump Repubs appearing on those other networks.
If they have a good reason, like needing to rearrange their sock drawer on November 3rd, those potential Biden voters probably not going to find time to go to the polls. So yeah, enthusiasm for Joe is lacking a bit.
🎉#WINNING!#KAG2020✝️🇺🇸 National Polls: Biden's Lead Over Trump Shrinks to 3pts.
Hey, Bolshevik Bernie, Trump CANNOT cancel rent, because the U.S. is still a Constitutional Republic. That's private property. Your ilk has to win on Nov. 3 to make everything the property of the State. BTW, good luck with Biden as your champion.
Remember, if you don’t vote Biden, “you ain’t black.” 😂
Truth Is, Biden Never Had a Firm Grip on Reality.🤪🤡

Comfortably safely center in America is smack dab on the right and I don’t think I should have to pretend I’m comfortable in the center. No one else on the face of the planet would call Joe Biden or 80% of our Democrats centrists. In most other nations they’re on the right.
I doubt he’d call his own father a pedophile and fascist but yeah I’m sure he loathed Biden as much as I do. I’m not signing up for either sports team they both suck.
I’m most definitely criticizing bigger issues. I am not a fan of the majority of the Democratic Party. I blame the party for constantly bending over backwards and basically letting republicans drag our entire country to the right. I know biden isn’t all bad.
Then why are we virtue signaling? Fuck em both. I understand what you’re saying but you and I both know my audience is well aware of where I stand. If I was speaking to someone on the fence I’d tell them to vote biden but I wouldn’t sugar coat it.
Biden’s nose would’ve got way too excited😂
Historically, democrats easily get over 50% of the vote in these states. Biden isn’t reaching that, based on this data, and Trump is polling unrealistically far below what he got in 2016. Easily flawed and biased.
I don’t think it will matter whether we are ready or not. But, IMHO, it won’t happen. I DON’T think he will be as lucky as Nixon. I doubt Joe Biden will pardon Trump.
I bet Biden announces his pick , the day ole Donnie accepts the nomination!
Anyone Biden picks , I’m supporting
Oh my.  Starting to believe that a good portion of Biden votes will be “sympathy” votes. Not why we elect Presidents America.
That seems to be their mindset.  Also Joe Biden briefly rode a bicycle today and we're all supposed to be excited about it, so there's that.
I'm supposedly a Russian for pointing out that Putin uses reverse psychology and people fell for it? What would you guys even do with yourselves if Putin "endorsed" Biden? Lol, so pathetic.
With Pelosi,Schumer, Schiff, Nadler, and Biden, Democrats already look bad.
I’m pretty sure he’s not voting for Biden lol
China is involving themselves in election interference in our elections this fall. Word is they want Joe Biden to beat Trump. Why is this the least surprising news this week?
I'm sure the way forward is to further subcategorize people based on skin color, male/female, etc.  This used to be called racism &amp; sexism.  If Harris is truly a finalist for VP candidate, esp w/ Biden's impending collapse, then competency surely isn't a req'd trait.
Hey my man, BLM and ANTIFA just came out in the open in Norman, Oklahoma. Booth set up outside mall flying BLM and ANTIFA flags. Plus Biden flags. I have pics and video if you like!
🚨The Biden Swap That Should Concern John Durham
Team Biden: Respecting the health of the public and their campaign staff during a pandemic.  Team Trump: Not so much.
Biden - Robin Williams video is viral - yet it showed up #7 on my YouTube search.  Anti-Trump videos were ahead of it.  Not to mention - the Libtards at YouTube deleted the remainder of the Williams video.  This is what Woke Nazis do.
No one had to die? Biden criticized  Trump for stoppping flights from China on 1/31 before one American had died from Covid. More would have died under Biden. The “experts” that you value so much had early predictions of 2 MILLION Americans dying from Covid-19. Wise up.
Yeah when biden announces his running mate  biden will see his numbers drop
Once again, as in the "I take a cognitive test every day" comment, Fox News takes Biden completely literally, even though it's obvious to everyone else that Biden is trolling them.
"Just nab any old black person -- they're all pretty much interchangeable," Biden reportedly told his aides. "That Stacey chick, the Kamala cop lady, heck, get Denzel Washington for all I care. Any of them are fine. And poor VP candidates are almost as bright as white ones."
You’re so cute for continuing to believe that Biden’s gaffes are in any way comparable to Trump’s repeatedly stated intent.
What about Biden saying he wouldn't trust a vaccine because it's from Trump?  LMHO!!🤣🤣🤣
"Go away."  She has as much right to run for president as Biden or Trump.  But, of course, you do not believe in rights - which are what the Libertarian party is about.
uh y'all outta check out the profile on this guy... yes, he dunks on biden, but he's not your friend
BIDEN IS PICKING TOM IZZO AS HIS VP?!?!?!?!
The manner in which Joe Biden has dealt with personal tragedy has been reason enough for me to vote for and support a man of such courage and dignity.
Nope, pretty sure those taxes are going right back on the top 1%. As far as crushing the economy, seems your daddy crushed the one Obama/Biden gave him.
Calling out Biden for saying all black people think alike and then saying that he doesn’t deserve the collective “black vote” is just... pretty spot on for 2020
#REDCHINA &amp; #Iran both support Biden.
Excellent article on Biden's options for VP.  I'm still on #TeamDuckworth
BLUF:  - China doesn't want Trump to win re-election, seeing him as "unpredictable." - Russia is attacking Biden via multiple means, as they see him as being tougher on Russia. - Iran wants to undermine Trump and further divide the US.
No longer? Biden has shown contempt for black people all of his 48 years in DC. If a Republican had shown a fraction of the racism Biden has, he would have been run out of politics decades ago. Different set of rules for Democrats.
😂😂😂 Kanye West 'admits he's running a spoiler campaign to draw votes from Biden &amp; see Trump reelected' in bizarre interview
Think the blacks that were imprisoned because of Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill think he’s a good man? Did you know that a bill signed by DT, First Step Act, served to release a lot of these blacks?  Biden gave eulogy for Dem Sen Robt Byrd in 2010, a former Klansman. Biden’s a racist.
Well we know pelosi isn’t prayerful for trump I don’t know anything on biden but funny he hasn’t condoned the burning of bibles if he’s for god
I agree with this stance; it sucks but I will commit to getting that awful man and his cruel administration out of office, as well as voting for progressives to take office. Others might disagree, but it's their vote and if Biden couldn't win them it's on him.
There are zero 0 reasons to vote for Biden.
Yeah, but Biden apologized for that comment. The conservative media and Trump are doubling down on this mis-pronunciation.
Folks, Biden's OK-5 numbers are going to come back to Earth as we approach Nov. Not saying he won't win OK-5, but by 8% is a stretch not even an Armstrong can do.  That said, no way Biden loses Okla Co by 10% this time. Races here that were within 10-15% in 2016... look out?!
Fact check: Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox &amp; Friends interview
Any discussion Joe on the latest Biden statement that “blacks, with a few exceptions, don’t have diversity of thought”?  Didn’t think so. Fake News is also ignored news. Biden is a racist. And you’re hiding it.  Pathetic.
Any guests speak to the fact that Biden is considering Representative Karen Bass (D-Ca) as his VP running mate? The same Karen Bass that visited Cuba 8 times and after the death of Fidel Castro, stated it was a great loss for the people of Cuba.   A Communist sympathizer for VP?
So Biden gets to “clarify comments” when saying something overtly racist, but when Trump says anything he’s a racist no matter what he said. Ah I see
Biden &amp; Sanders Collusion🙄.....
🚨Biden: Illegal Immigrants Who Work 'Should Have Access' to Subsidized Health Care!
He cannot pronounce Ulysses, Yosemite and now Thailand. And he claims Biden is mentally unfit. Laughable.
So it's kind of hilarious when the right and/or the anti-anti-Trump left keeps trying to weaponize entirely predictable Biden gaffes. Stupid shit may end up deciding this election (it always can), but that's not the stupid shit that'll do it.
Joe Biden has been so gaffe prone throughout his career that he's essentially immunized against paying any political price for any new gaffes....especially in this day and age when, if you're a white dude, even scandals basically don't matter any more.
Biden has zero chance of winning in a debate with anyone. Unless the Moderators feed him the questions in advance and he has a teleprompter to answer them. Knowing the Dems history of dirty tricks, it wouldn’t shock me to see it.
Big Trump fan huh Ben? Wait until Biden’s your President if you want to appreciate Trump. And believe me, you will appreciate Trump.
Daily reminder,  FUCK JOE BIDEN!
If this were true I’d actually like Biden
That thing called “racism” just keeps popping up with Bunker Biden. Where’s the Media? Zzzzzz
The real reason - not racial strife - that she upset 'with Trump' is probably because a whole lot of people are pressuring her to become Biden's running mate.
Hello fellow Republicans! Either you put up with our current President or your other choice is socialism. Your choice but I guarantee if Biden wins you’ll be begging for Trump back when we turn into Venezuela.
Against  ✔️God ✔️Guns ✔️Energy If only Joe Biden was actually this cool.
Joe biden is racist
Not a single person voting for Biden can legitimately say they are voting for him because he is a good candidate...they are voting for him simply because it’s not Trump. 🤦‍♂️
He Really Said This: Biden AGAIN Suggests African American Community Is Not Diverse!🍿😏 #KAG2020
Republicans for Biden? What a freaking joke you people are!
Judging by that comment, you've obviously decided to ignore Biden's obvious mental decline (and he started with a pretty low bar).  This says more about  &amp; her TDS than anything else.With Biden in charge that will drop to zero. He will let them have anything they want
Older voters must’ve wanted Biden because they trusted him when with Obama. Idk lol I’m not in that demographic group 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
I’m fully aware what dense means. LA, Boston, Detroit, all densely populated cities with nowhere close to the failure rate of Cuomo. Biden lied his way into politics by claiming he had 2 more degrees than he had and said he was top of the class when he was bottom 25%. They all do
No matter what you do to the #postoffice I am voting for Biden.
I can’t get over the fact that his team posted about “continuing his important work” and then immediately tweeted about the Biden campaign being “nuts...”
Biden really said “Man, people don’t want to vote for me? Watch this drive” and shit himself in the foot with his VP choice pushing even more people away from voting for him 🥴🥴
That biden Harris ticket is socialism
The U.S. is in the middle of a perfect storm: COVID-19, murders, the fight for civil rights and justice, birthing the era of the BLM movement with the greater plague-the Trump Admin. All of this: Still, we will rise; we will recover. A strategic God w/Biden &amp; Harris leading US.
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we journey down the road to recovery. It will take time but we will get there; we will recover.
Yehhhh Kamala: V.P Elect. Thank you Joe Biden for your pic; a sweet strategic move. May God bless you both and these United States of America as we are on the road to healing. It will take time but we will get there; we will heal.

What did tRump do for CA. Make a choice: Biden or tRump?
Nah different electorate. More young voters. And more angry voters than in 2016. The pandemic. The mass protests. More Gen-Z voters. And Hillary was Astronomically more hatable than Biden. Biden just seems more stupid gaffs than evil.
And if COVID-19 didn’t escalate to this point, trump would’ve won easily. Now he’s facing a rising death toll and is forced to fund Obamacare because they had no plan up until this point. Biden is riding the protests and pandemic to election.
And Biden supported the crime bill (which increased budgets for policing nationwide). Tell me again how Biden is a crazy Marxist that wants to defund the police?? If anything trump is making a good law and order case for Biden 😂
Let’s get to work! I’m excited to elect the first female VP!
Now get those Biden harris sticks printed so I can slap one somewhere
You mean Joe Biden was informed he received a running mate?
What a totally deceived &amp; evil statement! The opposite is true. Being a true Christian &amp; supporting the Biden doctrine is impossible. #Trump2020Landslide
If Biden doesn't pick a mixed-race transgender I'm not voting for him.
I will vote for Joe Biden, no matter WHO he picks.

Who running for president her or biden it sounds more like her
saying this with my full chest, I don’t like Biden or Kamala. but am i still gonna vote for this ticket because it’s the only shot to get trump out of office? 100%. and also, fuck jo jorgensen:)
Well, TBH Biden would say more twisted stuff if he could just remember, you know, that thing.
I heard that yesterday &amp; immediately thought-Baier misunderstood what the Judge was saying. Idk if she’s right, but I believe I know what she meant. Not that the D party would change their support of him, but that Biden would be unable to fulfill the role (medical/health reasons)
Because IF Biden wins, were going to go into a depression.  Hopefully neither happen.
Hey Tom, how’s Biden’s taint taste?  You’ve been there for a while now.
Biden will need to set up a 500 man task force to investigate &amp; prosecute THE TRUMP MOB! After CORVID, &amp; the economy...we need to clean up our NATIONAL DISGRACE created by the Republicans!
I will feel REBORN when we win back our country &amp; conquer COVID! It is in our hands...we have the team &amp; we have the power! GO BIDEN-HARRIS!
It was stupid for Biden to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate. In retrospect, the voters didn't want Harris as their president, much less their VP. LOL JUst wow!
Yet you vote for Biden who pushed a crime bill that incarcerated millions of black men. Anyone who votes for that racist and yells "Black Lives Matter" at the same time needs their head examined.
The best Kamala joke I’ve heard so far is this.  “Joe Biden picked her as his running mate”.  The punchline is subtle, but it’s funny as hell.
That might be the only person on this planet who would get me to vote against Biden
like why are they choosing to say oh well biden sniffs people like okay cool yeah he’s creepy but 43 women haven’t come forward saying he raped or sexually assaulted them!
Do you still think Biden is a racist?? What changed your mind please let us know.
Did he finally pick someone???? And seriously picked Kampala Harris?? The only way Biden can win is by cheating for sure!
So Biden’s years of racist politics &amp; bad political decisions don’t matter because- they’re the past, things change. But you think Trump supporters will just make excuses for anything bad he’s said or done. Got it.
There’s nothing safe about the Democratic agenda. Joe Biden might not be the most extreme, but his party is becoming that way &amp; that’s who he’ll be surrounded by. Biden has 30 years of showing us political bad decisions.
Suppose there’s another Supreme Court nomination come up in the next 4 years- Biden isn’t going to nominate anyone that a Republican would be ok with. My family is doing better economically with Trump. Not to say the pandemic didn’t hurt everyone, but we’re recovering.
Let's hope Biden immediately sets up a shadow government! With hundreds of people interacting on video meetings in their various areas planning their programs. On day one we HAVE to have a REVOLUTION!

No matter how you feel about Trump, how can any Republican feel good about voting in Biden? *also, people always forget the swindlers in this story. The Emperor was vain, but he was fooled by the Swindlers. Who are the swindlers? You? You certainly sang his praises.

How can Joe Biden get away with not presenting his policies to the people. He has done absolutely NOTHING. If he wins it will be by cheating.
I hope these debates happen. Joe Biden owes the American people some kind of clue as to what he stands for. Americans should not have to blindly trust a possible President. It should be illegal. He doesn’t respect Americans enough to come out and say something he should be barred
Here is a solution it is still legal for me to be on ballot as independent party candidate look it up F Trump and F Biden
Not to discount Biden’s ability to make me laugh with his Corn pop or hairy leg stories...
Biden won’t come out to talk and when he does all he can do is insult people
I would return the stimulus is the election is done properly. If Biden was to be president our future generations will grow up in  communist or socialist country. Our children and grandchildren’s entire way of life is at stake. He could turn this country inside out in one term
Biden should decline to debate TRUMP because TRUMP is unable to coherently discuss reality.
