Giraffe FAIL  via  Trump VS Ramps... hopefully this one will be him falling all the way out of the White House.
Just curious! I have been asking this for months with no answers! So tell me how is Trump‚Äôs vanity wall going to stop this?
Unbelievably and Incredibly I sensitive but no one would ever accuse trump and his ilk of having the sensitivity to care!
Do you think these trump supporters seem so pissed lately is because they know he‚Äôs getting his ass kicked in Nov.?
A great representation of Trump supporters! Not a single minority!
Hypothetically   If the attendees at the trump joke tonight catch corona, could they hold the golf course and therefore trump responsible. The bill hasn‚Äôt passed in Congress t

But China and Iran don‚Äôt want Trump? Is Biden weak with them? You guys are idiots
Really work with more communities? Like Sweden-I don‚Äôt recall Sweden allowing any of its citizens burn things down-left or right. Democrats allow to keep tempers up-see look what‚Äôs wrong-it‚Äôs trump elect us it stops-that‚Äôs a threat-

Someone should tell the F--in Morons on FOX that working Americans don't have a job to go to. FOX is out of touch with reality, as is dementia Trump.
There is as long as you can use the numbers to hit Trump over the head with.
Let me be clear.  If you are a Republican, then act like one and stand true to your principles, even if I disagree with them.  If you are a Re-TRUMP-plican, you are part of the problem and need to be voted out because you are spinless and have abandoned the beliefs of the party

Trump announced a new executive order that bans U.S. transactions with #TikTok owner #Bytedance and #China tech titan #Tencent, which runs the messenger app #WeChat
Trump is racist. But as VP....you can‚Äôt say that. Sounds like Biden has moved on from her and I hope that‚Äôs true.
With everything that is going on, trying to chill with my coffee. Listening to Stevie Nick's music, was thinking about the election and Trump. And this is what came on... And I saw Trump's reflection in a snow covered hill Until a LANDSLIDE brought it down. Smile. Vote Biden.
Trump signed an executive order to shut down TikTok. Because you know that is so much more important that the close to 160K deaths since March. Millennials and GenZ have Trumped Trump when it comes to the Social Media Game
Basic geography.  State capitals.   Even if he knew it was coming, Trump wouldn't be able to retain the information.
I enjoy mocking Trump as much as anyone but I just can't get behind the "thighland" thing.  He simply misspoke and quickly corrected himself. Not unlike when Biden recently misspoke and said "millions" when he meant "thousands" and immediately corrected his mistake.
Trump running to avoid prosecution? No, I don‚Äôt get that feeling at all. #slander #losers #nhpolitics
So yeah, something is not right here. I‚Äôm not buying that they are generally all of a sudden outraged about death , but rather, they sense an opportunity to get Trump and are taking advantage of it.
First off, the original projections were AT LEAST one million.  We are not even 20% of the way to that bottom figure, so why isn‚Äôt Trump getting credit for saving so many lives?
There is just something not right, maybe even sinister, but I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it, about the relentless blaming in the media of all the Covid deaths on Trump.
Trump reads the Bible, Yeah right, he's still reading, "In the beginning God created the heavens and Earth." That's only how far he got. #TrumpHoaxedAmerica

Trump is a blithering IDIOT.
I‚Äôm not a Republican but let me tell you, I feel bad for them considering that Trump supporters are giving Republicans a horrible rep. I don‚Äôt agree with Republican policies but I can atleast find common ground and be civil with true republicans. I cant find ground with Trumpies.
There‚Äôs a difference between true republicans and trump supporters.     are true Republicans who place their country over party. Trump supporters are not Republicans, they are cult members. Trump supporters have  defamed the GOP
Donald Trump, Mitch McConnel, corporate greed, the current state of my country, and my mother: these are going to be the reasons I lose it‚ù§Ô∏è
As much as I would love to agree with you I don't think that even if Trump loses that we will have seen the last of him. CNN predicted there is even a possibility of him buying into One America News just to keep his mug in front of us.
What are news outlets(not Fox) going to report on when Covid changes course and Trump vacates? What did everyone used to talk about, I forgot.
You love your prez because fox news told you so. Joe doesn't need to apologize to me but show his progressiveness with his actions. A steaming pile of crap is a better potus than tRump.
If my last name were tRump, I'd get the cash from my book and hide my face. No one wants or should follow a Trump, who is pissed at her dysfunctional family whose family is destroying our democracy. F Mary and all the tRumps!

Did you see even ten seconds of the Swan interview?  Trump is completely senile and he already has the codes.
When Biden is safely inaugurated we can all sit back and breathe a collective sigh of relief. But then we have to get right to work to repair the damage Trump inflicted.
Reality TV at it's finest. Trump could only dream of the ratings. Jerry Springer should moderate.
Michael is right about being insulting, but the real insult is on the rabid white nationalists who are stupid enough to believe that just because of skin color all Blacks vote together. Just like they voted for an idiot named Trump!

The picture is of Biden praying in the AME church in Charleston where he went to mark the anniversary of the massacre of 9 people at a Bible Study. But to the Trump minions, that's a sign of weakness.  Also - note the comments asserting Biden is senile? Russian-driven nonsense.
Glenn, when Trump lies as much as he has in office, an unprecedented amount even for any President, it‚Äôs difficult for any rational human being to start with the premise that he‚Äôs trying to be accurate. We start with the premise that he‚Äôs probably lying to defend his other lies.
Why must Biden be so combative? This certainly isn't the first time he escalated a relatively benign question into full on confrontation.   He would be well served to remain as calm &amp; composed as often as possible to highlight the distinction between him and Trump.
Trump to be re-elected
Mask man who hates Trump supporters.  It‚Äôs a New NH.

let's face it. You are trying to create a racist America but not with Trump. Do u support ufettered voting rights? Liberal judges who support human equality? A non religious State that doesn't take sides? Jesus never hated or judged. Hypocrites!
as President you made things happen. I'm honored to have voted for you. This Trump idiot on the other hand... I'm honored to have written in your name.
you guys may be hypocrites but u have money and talent. When trump is out, will u go back to supporting hidden racists? States Rights? Cut taxes? War on drugs? Your greatest racist hits?

Ignoramus Donald Trump sued Nevada for mail in voting, will it even be able to go to court in 90 days? Then he says Obama's eulogy was angry and not what our country is about. Voting is precisely what we are about. John Lewis was about the right to vote. #TrumpsaMoron

What signs? Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm aware of this one. Last sign related post I saw was a friend of mine complaining about Trump signs in Dracut, but that‚Äôs not really worth tweeting about.
I like your optimism about New Hampshire, but as one who lives just over the border from there, I see an awful lot of Biden signs up there. Signs are split pretty evenly between him and Trump.
If you never voted, now is the time to start by voting Trump out. He cares about no one but himself.

Just heard that Joe Biden will not accept the nomination in Milwaukee and it sounds like Donald Trump won't accept the nomination in Charlotte and/or Jacksonville. Hot take: in 2024, one of the parties will just hold their convention in front of a green screen

Trump basically left it to individual states to create their own safety rules, basically being a republican and providing less government over sight, he did ask doctors and crate guidelines but ultimately it was up to the states themselves and they failed their duty to the people

People are individuals. Many good people love guns and small government or just tolerate Trump because they don‚Äôt like Dems.   Many Dems who support woke candidates with policies that empower the poor, are still hateful, greedy, self-centered people who mostly just want accolades
One of my aunts loves Trump too. With her you might be right. She‚Äôs always been kinda mean and hateful even though she loves me.  I know some real jerks who are liberal too. Egotistical, morally self-righteous. Some value ambition and attention over charity and understanding.
My neighbor loves Trump. He also loves his kid and helping me out, whether it‚Äôs helping push my wife‚Äôs car outta the snow or texting me when I leave the garage door open.   No one was more welcoming when my Puerto Rican family moved into our very white neighborhood.
I‚Äôm sick and tired of this idea that we have to pick a side. My sister likes Trump and her AR-15. She‚Äôs gonna teach my daughter to shoot it.  Nothing you or the internet or Trump or Biden ever tells me will overcome my 42 years of living and seeing how good and kind she is.
If you say police are bad, how are you at all different than Trump when he calls journalists and his critics ‚Äòenemies of the people?‚Äô  If all Trump supporters lack character and patriotism, how are you different than Trump when he says liberals want to destroy America?

Most of those deaths were because democrat run states and cities failed their citizens! Those same states reminded us all that they would not let federal government take over decision making. Now they want to blame trump!? That is plane and simple stupid. Do you agree?
In any of those questions Trump answered, was he coherent?
It only makes sense that Barack Obama is a Leo and Donald Trump is a Gemini

I would not normally recommend that anyone waste 30+ minutes watching a Trump interview, but this really should be essential viewing. Amazing job by
What Trump said was bad but, but, but . . .  What about this totally unrelated thing that's also bad that some non-descript people did?
Biden has interviews, not as many as Trump, but he's not POTUS.   But you probably rely on the doctored videos and chatter about his senility. That's fake news.   I encourage you to watch Biden for a complete conversation. He may not be a smooth speaker but he's coherent. Really.
Disappointing not being able to discern between a Racist and a Fascist.  I agree Trump is a Fascist and a Racist. And Joe Biden....I don't believe to be Racist..that's good.  But excuse me, make no mistake when it comes to economics.....He is a Fascist.  Economics 101   üêÇ or üêª

Kudos to  for being patient, persistent and laser focused on getting Trump to answer the question asked and to clarify/justify his statements.  Every journalist, please push back on Trump's lies/delusions. Dont accept his bullshit.
The fact that shut your mouth is trending to trump is insane. Democrats have a monopoly on social media. Republicans need to get in or get out. It‚Äôs the new future.

I share the concerns of Trump and others on mass, never-before-tried-on-this-scale #MailInVoting.  But it will likely be a reality.  The #GOP should have some people fighting against it in court, where and when they can, but they should have many many more others
Trump needs to continue to show that leadership on the virus through November in order to win re-election, no matter how well the economy improves, or how much the civil unrest/ violence subsides, if it does.
I give credit to Trump and the campaign for finally accepting that the #Corinavirus is the main issue today , whether they like it or not, and dealing with it appropriately.  I share their frustration that other things such as the economy and security aren‚Äôt number one, and I...

Trump is ok with making our kids sick!
I still have to give the edge to Biden in the #PresidentialElection,  but Trump has certainly narrowed the gap.  Battleground state polls are tightening.  The change in leadership at the top of the campaign has seemed to help; more serious, focused relevant messaging
First and foremost.. Obama and his administration 2nd antifa and Black life‚Äôs matter for spreading the race bait 3rd the mayor of the city for allowing the riots 4th the governor for not bringing in the national guard 5th Trump for not bringing in 5x the troops and crushing them
#WomenAgainstTrump It blows my mind that any woman would support Trump. My mother is in the Trump cult and she can't explain to me what she thinks he's done for women, other than degrading them and treating them like they are a lesser being.

You mean kinda like this? Sure he's not gonna full stop it but he's an idiot of he thinks calling for less testing is a good idea (among all the other reasons he's an idiot).

He is not 100% at fault of course but if you ignore common logical fallacies like whataboutism and try to direct the convo elsewhere it really does nothing. Trump was a variable in this equation and a big one.  If he was a strong supporter of science we'd be in a better position.

2016. Your right Trump has no chance. Please keep saying it.

I'll really be glad when its all over am so sick of turning tv on and that's all you hear is negative am older so I have seen many things  but never anything like Trump he is just so nasty and Dangerous to the country
I'm not accusing anyone of anything. You're all just proving my point nicely. Trump's "racism" turns on subjective interpretation of what he says. Biden's racism is objectively racist.
Or if Trump said that poor kids were just as smart and talented as white kids
Trump is President now. He should set an example and make his stuff in America. Stop blaming everyone else.

And you're right. Maybe it wasn't a good idea for anyone to be marching with those people or be any way involved. I'm just saying that not EVERY person there was a supremacist. Some just didn't want the statute down. But either way Trump condemned the supremacists.
if I see the words "falsely said" one more time from the I Hate trump media I will run to my tweeter page and call them out just like you ,,,,,It can not be a kawinkidink.
Wrong. Trump loves everyone equally unlike Joe the racist.
Let me be clear.  If you are a Republican, then act like one and stand true to your principles, even if I disagree with them.  If you are a Re-TRUMP-plican, you are part of the problem and need to be voted out because you are spinless and have abandoned the beliefs of the party
Hey what if I told you that neither Biden nor Trump actually take their religious beliefs all that seriously, and saying that Catholics *must* vote for one or the other is a ridiculous false dichotomy
Another piece of fake news to disrespect our President! Put some celebrities in it because they know everything right?You people are as brainwashed as Biden! Go ahead and vote for someone that can't even put a sentence together unless someone orchestrates it for him!  Vote Trump!
Sure as long as you agree that voting and supporting Trump is the biggest mistake you ever made in your life.
If Trump could get Biden to say some thing nice about religion , God or rebuke the liberals in the media who are anti religion , then it would be a public service.
Well she is 80. Trump/Biden shouldn‚Äôt be running this country either in their mid 70‚Äôs but I digress.

I knew they were going to do this; act like they were all acting in good faith only to wait until the last minute, throw up their hands and blame the democrats for not bending to their will so Trump can swoop in and look like he's saving the country with his fake executive order
Please Mr Trump take action today to help us!! I look for work everyday.
What‚Äôs your thoughts on protesters/rioters? Worse than a Trump rally!!!!!
My point is that when Trump says very fine people you have to assume that he is talking about white supremacists. You have to  subjectively assign the most racist meaning to it. You don't have to assume anything with biden's racism.
Trump signed an executive order to shut down TikTok. Because you know that is so much more important that the close to 160K deaths since March. Millennials and GenZ have Trumped Trump when it comes to the Social Media Game
What does this even mean,,., let‚Äôs pay attention to business, 1.8 million jobs added,  unemployment down to 10.?%..,  Cuomo is bleeding out and pleading for the rich to come back TRUMP 2020
So basically, the NRA is run just like the Trump campaign.
See that's this thing. To find racism in what Trump says you have to ignore entire parts of what he says. In your example you ignore the part where he says "not white supremacists, though. They should be totally condemned." He said it in the same sentence lol
Trump never said that poor kids are just as smart and talented as white kids. See Trump's supposed "racism" is subjective, determined by people who either hate him or look for racism in everything. Biden's racism is objective, overt racism.
Kind of does for me. What it does **NOT** mean is never conservative. As long as the GOP remains Trumpy, even after Trump himself is gone, I will be never GOP.

Ok, my personal opinion is if the people closest to the press don't trust his ability to make an informed decision then there's a problem.  I don't like any president so it's not just my dislike of trump.
Ohhh, so Trump is showing off his Thai language skills. Interesting.
And before you think it because I hate trump, I do, but that's not it. I would feel the same for any president, especially one as old and questionable as trump or Biden. No pres should have unchecked power.
Obama whispered to Moscow stooge that he would help him "after the election" and made fun of Romney for pointing out Russia was a danger. When he said Trump would never win the nomination at the Press show, the one 2 yrs later they called Trumps female press sec a fat ass ,
I can understand that if they felt he was unfit to be able to handle a military option that they should have talked with the VP and Congress about pulling trump out by way of the 25th.

There‚Äôs a difference between true republicans and trump supporters.     are true Republicans who place their country over party. Trump supporters are not Republicans, they are cult members. Trump supporters have  defamed the GOP

Trump is a hoax #TrumpsFakeChristianity
What are news outlets(not Fox) going to report on when Covid changes course and Trump vacates? What did everyone used to talk about, I forgot.
He won‚Äôt let criminals out of prison, kill us with a virus, send well wishes to child rapists and spend our money on his hotels and golf courses during the worst recession trump created.
Of course Trump is a  #Biblicalidiot My parents were agnostic and I was raised with more Christian values than he has.
gargling Trump's balls for fun and profit
Your comment got me thinking. Did it matter who the GOP picked in the 2016 Primary? Those "in the know" thought Trump was the worst candidate (and they were right). But the alternatives: a woman (for party of white men? No), Bush again? No. Kasich (considered a RINO now) amaz...
Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
Grew up with that type, recognize!  Trump is a #FakeChristian
How did Trump suppress the black vote?  And he called for the death penalty when he thought they were guilty, but I'll admit is was dumb for him to double down on thinking they were guilty later on after they clearly weren't.
I also think that the media cherry picks and takes things out of context to further their position that Trump is a racist.
Nobody says your not going to believe this anymore when it comes to trump. Pretty sure that was the last one.
Free America from trump
CNN is propoganda. All news outlets are propoganda.  There is a comparison. Trump has never said anything overtly racist. Biden has on many occasions said openly racist things.    Either way. Your comment said Biden isn't racist, but you just admitted he was.
I am more confident that trump will send love letters to Maxwell. How‚Äôs Nestor?
NH Trump 2020!
You're telling me, in a year that ANY Democrat can beat Donald Trump, Joe Biden is the man?? The best?? üëå
I'll not lecturing. I'm just trying to help you shake those delusions. If you believe Trump is racist but Biden isn't, youre clearly delusional.
As did Trump's business practice. How many patents does your family have in China?
Honestly do you care what trump fans think?  Their just jelly that your safe and they are not.
Why are they clapping?  Not only is Trump an idiot but he has used that joke before.  I swear he thinks he is a brilliant stand up comedian.
Agree it‚Äôs an outlier just not a huge one. 40% is what McConnell‚Äôs Democratic rivals traditionally get. Also nationally undecideds are breaking towards Biden but in a deep red state undecideds will break towards Trump. They disagree with Trump but are. primed to hate liberals
Give me one thing... Just one thing.. That Trump has done to hurt black Americans.
Um. Trump lost in NH (and will again).  Yes, and we use the money to regularly crush cocky out of state repub operatives' dreams.   Btw, GOP data is owned by a national private corp, our data is owned by NHDP. Their data has about 20% of what our data has.   #nhpolitics
All good old Al and John needed was the votes.  Money or how Trump earned it didn't get me to vote for him.  I voted for Trump, because Hillary was the alternative. You know, the one in #pizzagte or #PedoIsland.  Drinks #adrenachrome, with the head bobing.
This is not just Trump v. Biden. This is Trump v. united    Biden has twice as many gen election wins than Trump. Obama/Biden ticket carried NH twice, Trump lost. (If you include FITN both Trump &amp; Biden are tied)   won 6 of last 7 (86%) prez races.   #nhpolitics

It's almost like the NY AG is working with the Trump campaign. This is galactically stupid timing
That's fantasy. Finch is correct, IMO. This plays right into the #2A crowd's hands. I'm not going to bite cuz I don't think Trump should remain anywhere near the Oval, but the vast majority will have no problem siding up with him to fight this. This is ridiculously stupid timing

Absolutely.  It is simply nuts and way out of hand.  I am so angry with the democratic leadership.  They only want this violence to continue b/ they somehow think it will help Biden get into office.  WRONG!!  I am an independent who loves Trump!
It's wild how many people on this thread are asking what our alternative is. Get involved in your state legislative races. Make sure you vote in (Progressive) people that won't cow-tow to biden OR trump. Veto-proof majorities in both houses, the exec is far less consequential.

Head on a swivel is the only way to watch this Administration and its enablers.  and Ukraine could be a significant source of election interference. Early in this presidency, Trump ID‚Äôd Johnson as a most useful tool. #nhpolitics

The #RNC is weird: Delegates are ‚Äúexpected‚Äù to attend but there will be exceptions if sick/quarantine. Still in Charlotte Arena...but essentially NO press (Only AP/Reuter‚Äôs and AON attending). Most speeches cancelled but some will go on.   So this is 2,000 in mini #Trump party.
If Biden get's 90 percent of the vote on election day , will dems admit that is impossible therefore we need a do over or demand Trump leave office anyway ?

There's no "they" controlling Trump. Unlike a lot of other politicians, where there are true handler's.  I'll understand if you don't see the good in that, but it's hard to argue that he has people controlling or restricting him. Like it or not, many are drawn to that.üá∫üá∏

Okay I‚Äôm confused on some of the ‚Äúwords‚Äù you use in that PA. Firstly it certainty is an opinion that trump is racist, just like you think it‚Äôs okay to through around a swatstika.
Maybe ur confused her about genocide and fascism let me help. Trump isn‚Äôt a fascist he‚Äôs a conservative republican, I study law and politics btw. Also genocide is murder of a specific race or culture. trump didn‚Äôt cause COVID, even if he did that‚Äôs not genocide.
First off here‚Äôs what ur forgetting. Adolf hitler killed 20 million innocent people because of their race. Donald Trump didn‚Äôt get elected because he was racist, most of those bullets for trump are opinionated. Hitler isn‚Äôt even close to trump.
What in gods name other than this do they have in common? When did trump commit mass genocide? When did he convert to fascism or started a war over the economy. U ppl don‚Äôt know how good u have it. Grow up

No wonder he got the Trump endorsement. He's got the sketchy business activity down pat.
These Democrats have created more hardship for the American people than we could imagine. I‚Äôm voting for Donald Trump
Democrats could care less about the constitution! They want what they want. Ever notice that all the thing they say trump is corrupt over ... it is them actually doing it!
But still, all Nixon did was one minor illegal act, surely his approval rating should have been HIGHER than Trump's!?
Trump is definitely doing this for security reasons, personal not national. #sarahcooper

I think trump bungled it and made it worse, but I agree, Im ok with spending an extra 50 mill for a temporary hospital that does not get used.  My issue is all the people who listened to his words and actions when he should have been a leader, not a cheerleader

Trump dated a Black model for 2 yrs before he met Melania. You can't hate that what you love. He's never been a racist.
Donald trump is a racist. Donald Trump is a rapist. Donald Trump is a murderer and I am fucking done not screaming it from the top of my lungs to anyone who supports him. Fuck you dad!
I swear the first time through I read that as "Why I spent my life savings on Blackiston's Fish Oil." I figured just another con in the time of Trump. Glad I did a double take.
Others came up with action plans, more workable solutions, will be devised by others. Donald Trump claims that these were his ideas, that he devised it. Some people will believe it.

Liz, there will be no reason for Biden to debate Trump. The media w/protect him. Mail in voting will start before debates. I hate to say this but Dems are winning at every step. Blaming Trump for Covid 19, the poor economy, due t shutdowns. Trumps people suck. He's a one man band

Trump took a cognitive test as most elderly people do. Part of it is to draw a simple clock with the numbers and hands to representing any time. Trump: there you go. Done. It's the best. Everyone says it amazing. Nurse: yes, Mr. President. It's very nice, but we said  cLLLLLock.

Racism has existed and will always exist in the US in some form or another. To say that Trump is the reason this ONE guy is there is ignorant. Trump has done more for Black communities than Obama did, and he‚Äôs condemned the White Nationalists and Nazis
Try Tunisia. I always wanted to see what was left of Carthage after the Romans destroyed it. The Russians have been saying ‚ÄúAmericana delenda est‚Äù ever since the Cold War began. Looks like Trump is helping them finally achieve that.
Correlation is not causation. It is obviously Trump's fault. Isn't it? LOL Seriously, many liberal philosophies have only one weakness: Humans are involved. But, they can't see it and don't want to. Have a blessed Sunday.

Trump knew exactly what he was doing when he put that massive trump donor to head the USPS!  trump gave him the order to start slowing down mail service now in preparation for slowing down the mail before the November election so votes will not be counted!
You are a Trump puppet. He says jump and you say how high. The fact that you admire someone who is as untuned to the American constitution as Trump, tells me all I need to know about you. No class, no original thoughts of your own. You get off repeating all his lies.
3 months till November 3rd. Having another 4 yrs of Trump our country won‚Äôt survive him. He wants to change the day of voting because (he says Covid-19)he knows we won‚Äôt forget what he‚Äôs done and what a liar he is. Covid-19 is a nightmare of his doing .

Unlike the Trump administration, this Army veteran trusts Foreign Relations Committee member  to do all in her power to protect Europe and US military forces overseas. Trump has admitted he did not even mention the Russian bounties to Putin when they last talked.

ICYMI: Black Man Shot 'Execution Style' In 'Broad Daylight' After Giving Interview About Supporting Trump
There are definitely other situations in which it makes sense to call Trump a murderer, but in this particular case he had consent from his victim, which I think matters.
While Trump certainly bears some responsibility for Cain's death here, that responsibility is akin to a doctor assisting in a physician-assisted suicide, and since I would not call such a doctor a murderer, I am reluctant to apply the term to Trump in this case.
Looks like Trump's propagandists are taking over at VOA:
They won‚Äôt be able to push back the elections. That‚Äôs an unheard of precedent. We went through a Civil War and 2 World Wars without doing so. Were it to be forced it would certainly be a negative mark on Trump.
Thousands of people are buried there. They lost their lives in the two world wars. Some fought for the Kaiser, others for the Nazi regime. There were no Nazis around in WWI and Hitler and his criminals got in the last free election 33% of the vote. He got less than Trump.
In June, Trump decided to hold a rally in Tulsa. Some Republicans attended out of a sense of defiance, including Cain, who was photographed‚Äîlike most  without a mask. Nine days later, he was hospitalized with COVID-19. Today, he died at a hospital
Or Trump orders Postal Service, which his crony now controls, to stop delivering mail because of some irregularity; lawsuits filed to order mail to be delivered; appeals; this is far from over......
Most people are so obsessed with Trump now that political beliefs don't matter.
Nobody deserves it. They shouldn't be blaming him, his blood is on Trump's hands.

Trump loves creating doubt. He believes his disciples will do anything to keep him in power.
A hallmark of authoritarianism is having democratic processes that are just for show to enact the despot's will. Trump is giving a signal to his Congressional loyalists. He can't do this himself, but they will.

If you had asked me in 2016 if Trump would try and delay the 2020 election because he was responsible for 30 million people being out of work and causing massive social unrest, I would have said that seemed like you were low balling it.
We always knew that Trump would try to find a reason to attempt to delay or cancel the election that would boot him out of office, but his own chaotic mismanagement of a global pandemic that killed 150,000 Americans was not on my bingo card.

PPS: I'm not TELLING you to vote for Biden. I'm just stating the effect of choices that you have.  It's PURE BS to say that Trump and Biden are the same.  If you're ok with letting Trump win, that's your choice.  But OWN IT.  Don't hide behind Bernie...  ...BERNIE IS VOTING BIDEN
Who says I voted for Biden?  You don't control my vote.  You holding the Democratic party (and thus the nation) HOSTAGE TO YOUR SELFISH DEMANDS is HELPING TRUMP.  YOUR ULTIMATUM IS HELPING TRUMP.  If you're not against Trump, you're with him.  PS: BERNIE SUPPORTS BIDEN.
Considering the National Letter Carrier Union‚Äôs recent endorsement of Biden, any Trump supporter who has a sign indicating so in his or her front yard, should either vote in person, or drive their ballot to town hall themselves.  No joke. Just be safe.  You never know.
Something is not passing the smell test for me.  In their three joint appearances so far, neither Biden nor Harris have taken any press questions.  And now, it looks like none of Biden‚Äôs campaign are going to be making appearances on the Sunday morning talk shows tomorrow...
This woman is such a monster. Let's laugh of the credible sexual assault allegations against Biden. Let's laugh off him drafting the Patriot Act. Let's laugh off of very rotten thing the man has ever done. Let's pretend it's fine because that's what helps us beat Trump. Go away.

Stop complaining about Biden when the alternative is 10x worse.

There is simply no greater moral or human rights  issue in our time than abortion.  It kills more innocent people than anything else.  I hope people understand the gravity of this issue, and think long and hard before voting for Biden/Harris or anyone of any political party...
...would be the most pro-choice, pro-abortion one ever.  The differences could not be more stark.  For those of us who believe in the sanctity of all human life from womb to tomb, the prospects of a Biden/ Harris Presidency should cause us grave concern.
In this election you will see the greatest disparity in terms of candidates positions on abortion than ever before.  The record clearly shows Trump/Pence is the most pro-life, anti-abortion administration since Roe v Wade, and it also shows a Biden/Harris administration...
I had my doubts about Biden‚Äôs Catholicism already with his stance on abortion, but his selection of someone like Harris, confirms my belief that he does not take it very seriously.
But upon reflection, I think that speaks to the reality that everyone is thinking right now, that Kamala would really be the President if they are elected, considering Biden‚Äôs age and clearly evident cognitive decline.
Wtfiswrongwithyou? Trump is a confirmed pathological liar. Saying Biden is a liar is mighty funny coming from a JPS trump supporter. Bless your brain

As a right-leaning political outsider, Kamala Harris as VP makes no sense to me.  1: CA is a safe state for Biden  2: She has little-to-no momentum in the primaries  3: BLM is reinvigorated and she locked people up for non-violent marijuana charges The Donald should be thrilled
They're gearing up to send more black men to prison. A Biden Harris ticket would essentially guarantee that the US will never not be the most incarcerated country on the planet. This is such an unbelievably dark election for the people and history of America. There's so much evil

Biden can't speak.
Perhaps but history is against her - George HW Bush was only VP since Martin Van Biden to become president after his predecessor competed his term
Enough said about Biden. What a leader.
Sorry if this sounds like fluff as refreshing as listening to Biden and Harris was, it was also refreshing to see how much their spouses really seem to love them.
The DNC working with Jill Biden have come up with a plan to help Joe in campaign events when he leaves his basement. Here is a picture of that effort
So that is what Biden and her have in common.
Skip the debates? It because we have seen Biden for for so long he we need to see him in a debate. I will retire in a year. I was 10 when he first won office.

Yeah I‚Äôm not that naive to junk that it‚Äôs all the candidate. But all the talking points today has tried to paint the picture that it was Biden who is bringing her in.   But after all the animosity during the campaign it just doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs a blend of ideas here.
So these turds think it's okay that Fearless Leader can conduct policy via Twitter, but Biden can't announce his pick online? OK, got it...üòè
Both could be an option but don‚Äôt feed me the line that it was all Biden.
Honest question.   Did Biden really pick Harris or did the DNC pick Harris for Biden?
What bullshit. #CrookedJoe picked #Catholic hater Kamala Harris for VP. Send Harris &amp; Herono asked a Trump nominee to resign from the Kights of Columbus but Biden is #Catholic? : Biden Plays the Catholic Card
I have a good title for Harris &amp; Biden The ROOSTER &amp; The Canary Get it rooster becomes she‚Äôs a cocksucker &amp; canary because it is a bird that is used to die Its life has no valu like JOkE üëéüòÄüá∫üá∏
Donald Trump isn‚Äôt going to go after policy issues. He‚Äôs going to go after the context of Joe Biden‚Äôs and Kamala Harris‚Äô character. Donald Trump is and always will be weak.
Nail, meet head! So well said. Thank God those white fossils didn't bbn prevail. I also hope Obama keeps his ear in Biden cuz, well, Biden...
I supported bernie but never got t hff e bernie bro meme. I WILL and DO support Biden and always was gonna support any Dem. Love Kamala too. This is t hff e most important election of our lives
With respect, the ‚ÄúAmerica as you know it will be gone forever‚Äù is nothing more than scaremongering. There is nothing extreme about Biden, and all of the constitutional checks and balances will still be in place. Trump‚Äôs divisiveness as a tactic must be repudiated loudly in Nov.
Biden is the candidate-Dems got that wrong as well-
No way! It hurts like hell. He is such a nice guy. Reminds me of a Hispanic co worker who thinks Biden is evil. They are lost to Putins propaganda and the dark web. We must shut those down! Fox news needs to be sued for slander. Outrageous!
I hope and pray you will have a prominent role in the Biden admin. I also dream of an all black administration one day. I believe the saving of this country will come from ur black citizens. I for one am ready
Just compromise. Something is better than nothing.  Why is that so hard? After biden wins, you can kick ass but you are losing this argument.  I'm a Bernie supporter and now  Biden/Harris "bro". Dont make is suffer to get at tRump. Please! Pretty please Speaker!

History was made today 8-11-2020: the first African American woman - of Jamaican and SouthAsian descent - will be the running mate to #Biden, the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. Kamala's mother was a trailblazer herself! #WomenSupportingWomen
Biden: "Let's Remember when America was Great"
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. I'm hip with it.
Fox's Cavuto fact-checks Trump camp claim that Harris called Biden racist: 'She never did'
This how Joe Biden started out?
I‚Äôll say this, as DA -  record is problematic. As a US Senator her voting record and advocacy on policy issues satisfy me thoroughly - and certainly moreso than Biden‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve settled for Biden.  I‚Äôll vote for Harris.
Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn‚Äôt distance themselves from Trump.
BIDEN-HARRIS ticket is awful!!!!  VOTERS: yeah, but the alternative is T...   VOTERS WILL REJECT THE BIDEN-HARRIS TICKET
Biden/Harris a Winning Ticket! We‚Äôre ready for November! Couldn‚Äôt be happier with this choice! Team Biden for the WIN! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate

‚ÄúKamala‚Äù James Harris dies on Sunday, Kamala Harris is chosen as VP running mate on Tuesday. #illuminati
It should be noted that Trump was not mentioned once in this press release as the alternative to Biden-Harris. Most likely because he‚Äôs exceptionally unpopular in NH. #nhpolitics

Joe Biden helped write the 1994 crime bill and Kamala Harris made a career of locking people up for marijuana offenses. So there‚Äôs the systematic change you all wanted, I guess?
well it should help #CrookedJoe Biden win California. #RaceCard

OMG...between Biden picking Harris and the NCAA cancelling football, Trump is going to be in the corner in the fetal position.

Kamala Harris Is Biden‚Äôs Choice for Vice President
And you know this for a fact? Even if you have seen Joe Biden tax plan whic I highly doubt, you aren‚Äôt smart enough to crunch the numbers! So quit taking out of your behind!
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Yet he still has followers. Truly baffles me. We need a landslide for Biden.
Depends on who wins the US election.  Biden: I‚Äôll stay Trump: let me know the fastest way to learn mandarin and cantonese
Biden doesn't hate God, I believe he is Catholic, and I am as well. We believe in God and his only begotten son Jesus Christ. By the way John F Kennedy was also Irish Catholic. I had a picture of John and Jackie with little John outside a Chapel. Trump is an illegitimate POTUS.

I voted for Susan Rice cuz she‚Äôd be the worst but Val Demmings would be Biden‚Äôs best pick.
We can‚Äôt let Biden destroy America
WTF is wrong with u. FYI, Biden hasn't won yet. If u compromised and told Americans in 100 days u and the next admin will fill those gaps, you would get support. But, you hate of Trump (which I hate too) is making us all suffer. You are a loser to us.
Love you, Amy, but if he‚Äôs Biden, please call them Harris and Warren. Or say Joe. Words matter, and first names signal reduced respect (when juxtaposed with surnames).
I did no such thing, oh You meant Joe Biden
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he‚Äôs on the ballot... that would divide Biden‚Äôs votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it‚Äôs not. We can‚Äôt have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020
Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.

Hey Donnie. I think you miscalculated the Kanye West situation. I believe he will take votes away from you, not sleepy Joe. Republicans that don‚Äôt want to vote for you or Biden will vote for Kanye. Another miscalculation on your part.
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
How is it racist to say some people say this person will cause Biden problems?. I'm talking about a possible candidate for VP. So any discussion of a candidates negative points is racist? Don't think so,
If Biden raise taxes the rich, what do u think will happen. The rich will pass that tax down to us, the poorer people. That could mean lower wage increases, job cuts, higher prices, a ripple effect back down to us. Raising taxes on the rich is a joke. People like u r fooled by it

I remember that so well, Trump was sworn in. It was so memorable. Or where you suggesting Biden being sworn in? Biden will see that crowd, leaning over to someone close, and whisper, what's the big occasion? Then Kamala will be told, you don't need knee pads for this promotion.

Don't you just wish his father wore a condom that night?
He chose Booker because Biden has praised Booker's policies on housing on his own website and said that he is going to expand those policies. Even though factually incorrect, it's not a leap to assume that Booker would be in charge or heavily involved.

Joe Biden is a single term president. He is too old to run again. Kamala Harris‚Äôs negative upbringing to power hopefully is because she had to play by what she was given for political gains. We should have a better candidate options in 4 years. This is the first step !

Promising to speed up the insolvency of SocSec and Medicare is a sure fire way of getting those elderly retirees in FL to turn out in droves, just probably not with the results Trump is banking on. The Biden campaign should just run Trump‚Äôs own words on a loop.

History was made today 8-11-2020: the first African American woman - of Jamaican and SouthAsian descent - will be the running mate to #Biden, the presumptive Democratic Nominee for President of the United States. Kamala's mother was a trailblazer herself! #WomenSupportingWomen
This how Joe Biden started out?
President Biden. VP Kamala. Senate Majority Leader Warren.  I MEAN COME ON.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden  #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020
Ridiculous. Neither Biden nor Harris support socialism. This life-long GOP voter (until Trump) will never support the current GOP ticket, nor will I vote for anybody who doesn‚Äôt distance themselves from Trump.
As long as you don't Force anything, you still got my vote. But know wavering, I get any word your forcing vaccines, and I'll buy the whole town Biden signs.
She was really impressive! Really excited by Biden/Harris!
Far left radical? Seriously have you met Biden? #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpHatesWomen #Trumpisacrybaby #TrumpIsARacist
But that doesn‚Äôt make Biden competent. It‚Äôs a valid concern.
Remember when Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching?
Flashback: #KamalaHarris said she believed women who accused #Biden of inappropriate touching #BidenHarris2020 #lol #Metoo
would not vote for her but I can see her as pres more than I can see Biden.
Just so we're very clear.  Biden &amp; Harris were not in the most corrupt administration in American history, didn't destroy the economy, let 160,000 Americans die or inflame the streets of America by being racists, nope that's the impeached Trump &amp; his toady Pence. #nhpolitics
Biden/Harris 2020 I'm all in.
Hey Peter should we start quoting the brilliant Joe Biden?
This is a c/p pitch for the Hillary 2016 campaign, no? Or yes, but Hillary was perceived as a b*tch so this is different? The overton window moves faster than this pick (or Biden for that matter).
Now the narrative becomes if you don't vote for Biden Harris you're a racist.
Gonna be interesting to see the Trump campaign continue trying to push the Biden wants to defund the police line after Biden picked one for VP.
With the news of Biden's #VPPick, it is time to bring this back. Tulsi &gt; Kamala Harris. #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
Who's got the Biden Harris lawn signs? I need one!
What a joke.  I first met Joe Biden in Manchester in 1980. For 40 years Joe Biden has been a strong and consistent friend of NH. But I can imagine how shook you are about the   ticket winning NH big! #nhpolitics
Where am I in the Biden picture?
Biden chose harris...if they win were fucked
She did say that she believes Biden's sexual accusers though.
Awesome news.  Awesome choice. Awesome ticket.  Let's do this!  Biden-Harris 2020
And... she *is* to Biden‚Äôs left. So while it‚Äôs not a huge nod to the left... it‚Äôs not, oh... Pete.
Very happy for the Democratic ticket of Biden/Harris! I was lucky enough to meet both spouses of the future President and Vice-President!
I‚Äôm sorry but I utterly despise Harris. She‚Äôs an unapologetic authoritarian who will step on and destroy anyone she can for power. Her record as a prosecutor is atrocious. I will never ever vote for Trump, but this just made voting for Biden a lot harder for me. We‚Äôll see.
Biden's pick causes DOW to go down over 100 points,
Statement from  NH state director    "Selecting Kamala Haris is a promise to the next generations that a Biden-Harris administration will fight for progressive policies and act as a bridge to a new generation of leaders"  #nhpolitics #youthvote
Couldn‚Äôt be more excited about the ticket. You will be soundly trounced by Biden and Harris.
Congratulations to VP Nominee #KamalaHarris. Biden-Kamala 2020! #KamalaHarrisForVP #Kamala #BidenHarris2020  Below  is a picture I managed to get with our presumptive VP Nominee, Kamala Harris, at a rally in NashuaNH last spring!
Harris: hey Joe. I think you're racist and a sexual predator. Biden: I know. Do you wanna be my VP?  How weak does this make Biden look?
Biden + Harris, two Democrats responsible for incarcerating more black men than every current Republican combined.
Biden + Harris, two Democrats responsible for incarcerating more black men than every current Republican combined. #nhpolitics #VPPick
I‚Äôm not crying but I‚Äôm not clapping either. This is basically the choice between suicide or lifelong depression and general anxiety disorder. Clearly Trump is going to kill us. Biden Harris are just going to make us wish we were dead. But I will #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Does the least harm to the Biden ticket.  Rice would have fed the Benghazi lunatics. And Warren is a) also old, b) white, and c) too far to Biden‚Äôs left for Biden to be happy.   Not the ticket I wanted, but that got decided long ago.  Predictable.  Trump must go, so... ok.
They just posted some Biden/Harris swag and I saved the image
Dad just called to tell me that he, my stepmom &amp; their dog are all very excited about Biden picking Harris (I could hear the dog barking and my stepmom yelling "Yeah!!") He said: "Pence won't know what hit him in the debate and we'll get rid of that crook Trump!" #nhpolitics
Great.  Can we move on now?  lol  BIDEN 2020
President Biden, Vice President Harris, 2020 - 2024.
. is a fantastic choice to join Joe Biden on the ticket. She connected with the voters of New Hampshire during her campaign and has the judgment, values, and experience to lead. She‚Äôll make an excellent Vice President! #nhpolitics
Biden/Harris! The winning ticket!

Hope, excitement, admiration. Ready for President Biden and Vice President Harris!
Wondering if there was more of an FU NH ticket possible than Biden-Harris.  #nhpolitics #FITN
Looks like Biden picked the Dirty Cop for VP.
Only slightly surprised.
So excited to have  as Joe Biden‚Äôs VP nominee! She is a fighter, caring person, and will be ready to hit the ground running to help execute Joe‚Äôs plans.   Let‚Äôs do everything we can to get them elected in November! #nhpolitics
CNN reporting that Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Kamala Harris picked by Joe Biden as running mate
There it is. Biden's VP pick is one of his challengers from the 2020 Primary.
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate
Are we really going to find out Today or Tomorrow. All day yesterday they said Biden was going to announce her but that never happened. #Biden2020 #RidenWithBiden2020
So if this started off with the GOP signaling to black people that they think they‚Äôre stupid and will vote for Kanye over Biden, and ends with the GOP getting Kanye sent to prison, does that help or hurt their standing with minority voters?
I think you mistyped that. It was supposed to be "top advisers told Joe Biden this morning who his VP pick is."
Biden should show up at the press conference and make the announcement there!  (with a mask on of course)
I do not care if Biden's plan is to sleep the entire time!  We need to unite, break voter turnout records and vote Trump out!  Every single message should at least mention getting registered and vote.  NH Democrats must turn out in record numbers on 11/3!
Voting for Biden
Like Biden, lots of meds.
Imagine if Biden pledged to only consider a man? If you think that would be sexist, you agree that Biden saying the same about only choosing a woman is too.
Karine Jean-Pierre will be Biden‚Äôs Running Mate‚Äôs Chief Of Staff.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS!  VOTE FOR BIDEN!
If Mr. Biden were my parishioner, I would have to follow the example of those brave priests who have denied him Communion.
Or, just spitballing, Biden wouldn't stand up and say he's not taking responsibility, and actually take responsibility, like a real leader, and do something about covid.
‚ÄúGYM‚Äù Jordan the masochist and it would only take one good punch and hed be knocked out, by a woman nonetheless.   Sexual misconduct should never have allowed him to get this far.   We need people that are above reproach like Joe Biden !
If America wants Barack Obama to be president for another 8 years then vote for Joe Biden üëéüòÄüá∫üá∏
Biden was going down hill he had to keep peddling to keep his balance notice how he didn‚Äôt stop he would have fell on his head LOL üëéüòÄüá∫üá∏
Obama, without question!    Next to Obama, 2nd would be President Biden and 3rd would be Hillary Clinton!
Biden‚Äôs V.P. Pick Is Said to Be Imminent
Wait you said you're voting for Biden but you have no tolerance for stupidity, deranged leadership confused message and destroying the constitution.   So which is it?
Can I order two Biden/Warren 2020 yard signs?
YES!!!!! Another incredible N.H. Primary alum is rising in the ranks! Turn PA Biden Blue,
Where Joe Biden lives and where Donald Trump holds campaign speeches are two completely unrelated things but you knew that didn‚Äôt you?
And what does my race have to do with anything?
Biden's plan? Let Trump talk.
Obama wasn't a Progressive either. He was a centrist. You just don't understand the terms. Cops are fine, but with a current progressive effort to defund police departments and get cops under control in America, a cop might not be the best person to do it.
I'd rather watch a loop of Biden on his bicycle. #RidinWithBiden2020
Democrats must have a reckoning with their past not ours. Slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, Biden‚Äôs crime bill, ect. Only then can America heal.
I love Bernie Sanders with all my heart, but if people vote for Bernie this November simply because he‚Äôs on the ballot... that would divide Biden‚Äôs votes. Do NOT vote Bernie in Nov. I wish it could have been different but it‚Äôs not. We can‚Äôt have any more of Trump. #VoteBiden2020
Shitcago isn‚Äôt Joe Biden‚Äôs Zoo! üôÑ
Aided/abetted by U media clowns becuz  doesn‚Äôt put up with your non stop anti American bs. Lies, hoax‚Äôs and anti American rhetoric piled upon us by  has caught up, now go ahead push Alzheimer‚Äôs Biden and shit on us some more. #Trump2020Landslide
Honestly, whether Biden is up 7% or 9/10% nationally doesn't make a world of difference when it comes to the outcome. He would win solidly in any of these scenarios, only places where it'd make a difference would be like GA/TX/OH/IA/ME-2 etc after Biden's already at 334 EVs.
She's a COP! She spent her career LOCKING PEOPLE UP. I don't like that. That's not progressive. I don't need to do research because I've been watching for the past 50 years. Progressive is a platform she does not support so STFU!
BIDEN SUPPORTS KKK
The stakes could not be higher in November. It is going to take us all rallying around the Democratic ticket to save the soul of our nation.   I hope you will tune in to the Democratic Convention next week and do everything you can to elect Joe Biden in November!
Joe Biden will reestablish America leading by example and put us in a position to address the challenges ahead.
Joe Biden has plans filled with actionable policies to address racial inequities in criminal justice, housing, health care, and so many more areas in a real way.   The current president does not.
Joe Biden knows how to get our economy back, distribute an eventual COVID vaccine, and prevent the spread of future epidemics.   The current president does not.
No...Joe Biden is a sick old man that will turn the country over to the far left. You know so much about Trump, why not Biden ?
Sounds like Biden's advice to his son
BTW I‚Äôm a huge AOC supporter and will be thrilled to see her as part of Biden‚Äôs administration. Cuz that‚Äôs how we evolve ya know?
If you buy that she's a progressive. More than Bernie or EW? I call bullshit. Kamala Harrtis is a centrist.
Trump better be ready for the debate because Biden is faking it.
im not paying Joe Biden to speak from  HIS Basement i am paying for the Trader and chief  to talk from white house TAX Dollars
Nope.  More than anything, I‚Äôm voting to *remove* Trump.   Biden is, eh, acceptable. And he could select something found forgotten the back of the fridge and I‚Äôd still vote for him.  Does it matter? A hell of a lot, yes. In so many ways. But won‚Äôt change my vote.   Will not.
I don‚Äôt care who the VP is, Biden has my vote. ‚ù§Ô∏è
#Biden doing the traitor thing again. I want a president that does not salute communist countries!
We can not let this happen! An American president spending our tax dollars on Americans is just once again proving how crazy Biden is! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
You lost all your credibility when you tried to say with a straight face that Biden is in a better mental state than Trump.
Ok.  But do you think that, in terms of mental competence, it is worse to mispronounce words like Trump, or not know where you are, what you're doing, what your name is, or who your wife is, like Biden
Ok again fine. But regardless of your opinion of Trump at least be honest and recognize that Joe Biden barely knows what's going on.
He has legitimately not known what state, city, or location he was in multiple times. He has literally forgotten his name. You don't like Trump, fine. But you're just being dishonest or willfully ignorant if you think Biden is in a better mental state.
Great point. Trump mispronounces a couple words. Biden hasn't known where he was, or what he was running for, or even that his name was Joe Biden on multiple occasions. Definitely the same.
I thought this was from the Biden campaign: #RIPKamala üò∂
Her only weakness, as I saw it was health care, but that has to be worked from a position of power. No one can say how to pay medicare for all until they can view all the revenue streams. Would you rather give a friend $ to buy food or to buy a gun?
Never Trumpers are being paid huge dollars to support Biden.
Biden and his elite friends force poor black children into failing schools. Why?
He acting like Biden  by saying he comes from a blue collar family Scaramucci is an idiot üëéüòÄüá∫üá∏
She talks like Biden have them talk at the same time to get a complete sentence üëéüòÄüá∫üá∏
Now we know why he's voting Biden.
President Trump supports religious freedom, while Biden goes to pander.
LOL! President Biden!
If Kanye Somehow Stays in the Presidential Race, It'll Hurt Trump, Not Biden  via
They way Biden is campaigning, he welcomes any distraction!
Making ridiculous mistakes is not the same as literally not knowing where you are. Lesser of two evils I know. Although Trump is not the smartest tool in the shed, Biden is starting to not know what is even going on.
Right. Just like the assumption should be that Biden can't run a country because he forgets where he is or what he is talking about more often than not.
Trump can't ride a bike? Is that supposed to be a big win for you? Did you "get him." Quick question. Is Biden still making horrifically racist comments on a daily basis on live TV?
Thought it was Biden
Is Joe Biden Actually Trying To ‚ÄúHurt God?‚Äù Trump Says He Is, So It Must Be True Erin Corbett August 6, 2020, 5:35 PM  NO‚ÄîJoe Biden would never ever try to hurt God.  Trump has come up with more lies over 30,000 in 3 years
Thanks for saying. I think it is high time for a Progressive to have a seat at the table. Bernie supporters are still licking their wounds from 2016, let alone 2019. We had 8 years of centrists with Obama/Biden and the people are ready to have a voice that considers the people.‚ù£Ô∏è
Is Trump just trying to get votes away from Biden by introducing a ‚Äúwildcard‚Äù nominee? Like is Kanye the new Jill Stein?
It's OK, he's Looking for the correct Progressive for the job!?! üò≥  Why Joe Biden Keeps Missing His Own V.P. Deadlines
I voted for the guy and I will again Biden would be an even worse choice
Yep, but you have to remember that he‚Äôs only capable of thinking 10 minutes ahead. All he cares about is getting re-elected. By the time people realize what the truth is, it‚Äôll be too late. If he‚Äôs still president, he‚Äôll invent another scheme. If not, he‚Äôll blame  Biden.
Being genuine here, what convinces you that Biden is going to win? I seem to have no hope we're going to get Trump out :/. ESPECIALLY given the sloppy campaigning - I feel like their doomed to repeat the same mistake 4 years ago
That plus the fact Trump simply does not know how to debate. He will make stuff up and Biden will be ready for it and slam the door on it. Then Trump will get frustrated and start with the insults and again, Biden will be ready and put an end to that. This should be spectacular!
Does anyone know about a secret deal between Obama/Biden between a high ranking sexual abusing priest in the Vatican and China that was shut down by Trump but will be reinstated if Biden wins. Just hearing about it, very complicated and sick !
Oh Biden does that all on his own every time that he speaks
Move along folk, nothing to see here:  Biden gaffes ignored by MSNBC's primetime shows for 3 straight nights  #FoxNews
Biden doing something criminal! Treason.
After Biden's comments on Black diversity, some worry blunders could impact support
How do any of Biden‚Äôs policies matter more then having a rapist in office? A man with no morals, pretending to be religious after constantly saying he is not and wishing well to pedophiles. How do you sleep at night?
My question, this followers purge - did it affect a single liberal? Can't imagine Biden's real number is over 17, so...
This " I can't believe I have to say this..." on Biden tweets is becoming so frequent it reminds me of  #ToddlerInChief posts or this bit
Yes, Saint Joe Biden, didn't he give the eulogy for kkk leader Robert Byrd AND call him a mentor AND friend? The reason for the President's blm comment is not the movement itself but the ppl associated with it that breed the hate and chaos. Nice try thoüòÜ
Nope. The VP pick is the one move Biden can make that will dominate the news cycle   Why play his Ace now?  Only political junkies care about the VP drama.  60% of public only cares about Covid and the Economy. I wouldn‚Äôt even do it until Labor Day unless Trump closes within 6%
I am  getting tweets from Biden people attacking Trump for doing this. I hope they keep attacking him like this as it is the only way the word will get out to all the media.
While this from the  is the most explicit, the entire coverage of Biden‚Äôs potential running mate has been equally sexist.  But, YIKES.
Instagram Displayed Negative Related Hashtags For Biden, But Hid Them For Trump
I likely am, I don't see it getting better with Biden. I'm not sold he wants change, and the DNC just wants a status quo puppet. The economy, tariffs to get cash back and investing locally were pros, but he is an ass. And Biden seems like he has alzheimers which could be very sad
Have you not seen Biden's track record? His crime bill, pro-segregation stances, racist statements as of late? I'm not telling anyone who is and isn't racist, just pointing out this man surely is no straight arrow
ü§£ I didn't vote in Trump, but back to my main point since you didn't read it the first time: IT DOESN'T GET BETTER UNDER BIDEN.
I wish I could be a wash out for one of the worst teams in the NFL, but instead I'm privy to knowing how big of a POS Biden is.
Biden has continually proven he's a racist shill. Nothing gets better under Biden.
Glad to see how much you love looking at other people's taxes, perhaps you should get a job at the IRS . Perhaps Biden's son would  like to show us his taxes. Also kids sometime read this site so we avoid 4 letter words.Anything to pretend the only thing going on is Biden's BS.
It is not clear that Biden will step down. I think he will be taken out due two mental incapacity. Then, if Hillary becomes the VP, don't be surprised if Harris is taken out. It sickens me to think that any of these things will happen, but this is bizarro world.
Exactly and she has demonstrated this over and over. Her appearance on the ticket was strange and I wonder if she was actually Biden's pick or is she there serving behind-the-scenes powers. Still, peace, love and blessings for all.
81% of people saying they'll vote by mail are Biden supporters.  67% of people saying they'll vote in person are Trump supporters.  Even Donald Trump can do that math.
Hick would be running way behind biden, but he wins narrowly anyway. it looks like bullock probably wins to get the Dems to 51... IA looks like it‚Äôs going down to the wire, so another narrow Iowa election might happen-carrying echoes of the dem primary so many months before
I see Bernie signs more than I see Biden signs  I also see Trump signs more than any other #Trump2020
ü§¢ü§Æ what about the ‚ÄúI believe Joe Biden‚Äôs accusers‚Äù which was said...  NOT DURING A DEBATE!!  I guess what she‚Äôs telling us is not to believe anything she says during a debate because... ‚Äúit‚Äôs a debate‚Äù
Good point. I didn't vote for the worst POTUS in American history. I'm voting for Biden/Harris
No-one is safe from the utter contempt that Joe Biden has for actual people
The one unambiguously good thing about Joe Biden is how thoroughly he owns the Pod Save bros and their Democratic Insider grift by ignoring them every single day.
You are a despicable piece of tyrranic filth. I hope Biden eviscerates you in November and you wind up in prison for the damage you have done to this country for the past four years.
What are the rules? Kamala Harris is born of 2 immigrants, not citizens at that time, making her ineligible to be President, correct? I‚Äôm asking. Should Biden have to step down (if he by a miracle won), Pelosi (if Dems retain the House) would then become President? Right?! Yikes!

Your correct, I voted for POTUS Obama and I'm voting Biden/Harris on November 3rd from NH
yo. When Biden wins. You know all you interns who run this will be fired. Right?
Truthfully, I believe she is looking at it short term for the relief everyone needs, but playing longball on a Biden/Harris administration doing a tax structure before Reagan and his Trickle Down
the election for president is for more than just NH, it's for the entire country. Biden/Harris would be better for the country overall even if they didn't focus on NH as much.
I mean, do you need any clearer indication of how Kamala Harris will say whatever she needs to say to get coverage than this? She's the perfect Biden VP in that she stands for nothing but protecting a viciously carceral state
Many of my fellow postal workers voted for Trump. Over 600,000 employees affected. Those are lots of votes that could go for Biden now.
Shit maybe Kamala Harris and Joe Biden will win in November
How did Politico know Kamala Harris was Joe Biden‚Äôs VP pick back in July when he probably still doesn‚Äôt know who he picked.

Kamala blasted Biden with fatal historical points, but yesterday just laughed and said it was a debate! Haha. There is no doubt that she is very intelligent, but also no doubt that she will lie, and accept anything, if it is in her personal best interest. She is not principled.
I'm not overly religious, but Biden is definitely Catholic.  Get your facts straight!
YES. YES.  YES.  Biden‚Äôs choice proves he‚Äôs neither afraid nor threatened to embrace those with different views from his own - GREAT choice!

I am anxiously waiting to cast my ballot for the Biden-Harris ticket!!  will make an incredible Vice President will do a great job wiping the debate stage with Pence.
If you are referring to Biden, I don't believe it says that.
Not nice. Biden is an asshole! I don't wish him harm. He can do that on his own.
Google "Joe Biden naked at pool" and find the US News and World Report article.
Have you googled the Biden material? I checked it before I posted.
Worships him? You really don't get the argument...and probably don't want to. Between Biden and Trump, Biden would be so terrible for the American public as he really cannot think well and clearly looks like he is in stage 3 of the Reisberg Scale.
It‚Äôs serious mental illness &amp; I had no idea it was such an epidemic here. Biden will make sure they get the help they need though.
Biden can‚Äôt win being the anti Trump. He has to detail a vision worth replacing an incumbent. People are loathe to change from the devil they know without solid promise of a better future.
