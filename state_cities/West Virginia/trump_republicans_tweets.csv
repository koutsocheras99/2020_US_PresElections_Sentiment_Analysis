Anyone with any sense will vote for Trump!!! Anyone that has any common Sense will hit the Republican lever!!!...The only way we'll get anything done is to take back the house, keep the Senate,and keep the presidentcy!!!
Won't blame ur old bro for going back on his words to protect elderly? Ur bro murdered &amp; u don't say a word. But accused Trump killing all the ppl who died from the virus? That's double standard little man
Dear  WTF, u r the 1 who faked having virus &amp; went out busted w/NO MASK. Ur murder brother  killed 1000s of elderly. U blaming  makes u look like an childish idiot. Caine didn't wear hi mask a lot. How can u blame Trump for everything but
On November 3, 2020 we will vote to evict tRump and any &amp; all GOP who have allowed him to destroy our Nation. We must be vigilant. We must ensure we take up the mantle left by Rep. John Lewis.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #ComplicitGOP  #Dems4USA
Postal Service backlog sparks worries that ballot delivery could be delayed in November    There is always another way to gum up the works. Trump is a piece of work. If he could spend a 1/3 of this energy on fixing #Covid19 crisis we could rejoice.
Well i guess Trump is about to cry and people are about to boycott the NBA like they did the NFL
Trump really got twitter fingers like nobody else
No, History will tear down Trump and his supporters.  Most of his supporters are tired, sick and alone anyways.  I know it's been bad so many won't visit family or former friends of the loyalty to the president.
i know that's correct so many trump lies.
Wow. About the Federalist Society guy isn't that the group that Mitch McConnell used to put John Roberts on the bench. Uh Oh. Trouble in Trump world.

I'm starting on Sunday in Ashland, KY. Congratulations and thank you so much for all your efforts. I look forward to starting mine as well and maybe together we can help the commonwealth Ditch Mitch AND Dump Trump.
It IS vote shaming as you're trying to say Trump winning and the subsequent garbage that he will do to the U.S. will be my fault and the fault of those like me.   and  are corrupt, and I refuse to support either one. Deal with it.
I thought Trump said if you don't support him you'll be poor what you're saying is the inverse.
Trump Will Do Whatever It Takes to Win
President Donald Trump drew immediate rebukes across the political spectrum Thursday after floating the prospect of delaying the November election.

He's the only pres. to give over double to negro universities to help them. I wish u &amp; other media to step back &amp; really be honest about everything Trump has done good &amp; biden has said
Remember those old, old, adages the GOP used to state? Fiscal Conservatism, Balanced  Budgets, Spending Cuts? Or were those invoked to thwart Democrats? Why don't you try them on Trump?
He's letting states make their own minds up. Ur the communist not Trump
lmao off u &amp; ur interview.  would get it done faster if u 2 put stuff aside &amp; just work for Americans. Nancy Americans know u r the 1 holding back &amp; trying to make Trump look bad. U haven't learned yet? Trump is also not a tyrant, then y did he say

You should hate the GOP and Trump for lying to their sheep. This could have been avoided if he had stayed home or if he had worn a damn mask.
Did all trump is a rapist.  The proof is in the pudding.  Look at his close friend Jeffrey Epstein at what happened to him.  God will get you Mr. Fake President.  Oh and what is this I hear you weren‚Äôt actually born in the United States?  Hmm?  Show your proof Donny.
I watched news channel the other day, excuse my comments but pure common sense, one said they would vote for Trump again because covid-19 and the economy was not his fault and compared deaths from covid 19 to deaths from auto accidents, heart attacks, cancer and more. Bull !!!!!!
Ohio loud and proud for President Trump!
But what good are videos? Trump goes on video and lies every time he talks but the republicans deny it.
That‚Äôs exactly what we need. This country is a shambles because of Trump. Fauci served under six presidents that apparently listened to his advice. Except the current one who thinks he‚Äôs almighty
Goosebumps. This is what it means to be "Presidential." Trump will never be invited to participate in such events of significant importance and celebration. mark my words
So to protect a few from abusive parents all children must be sent back to school amid exposure to deadly COVID-19 ?  You have no morals, you lie for Trump. Caring for kids is not this WH concern. You have caged them, even.
Trump legit trying to make himself a dictator.
So, a man who has voted by mail in for the last 4 elections says it‚Äôs fraud??? Imagine being so scared of losing that you want to postpone the election indefinitely. It‚Äôs insane that out of so many people in this country our options were Trump/Hillary and now they‚Äôre Trump/Biden.
I gotta stay off FB today. Too many people saying "Trump can't postpone the election! It's against the law!" as if 1) he gives a shit about legality &amp; 2) he doesn't RIGHT NOW have federal forces &amp; hired goons kidnapping civilians in plain sight.   I just want to shake them all.

Trump is not even trying to hide the fact that he cannot win without voter suppression.
So she is telling us the Democratic strategy, how the press tells lies , and how  Barr hearing Democratics repeat lies generated by them and the media , like they still claim  has secret love for Putin , Trump only wanted to get Putin to stop helping  Iran
Mitch McConnell and a US Senate in Political Lockdown to protect the Felon In Chief from all threats both Constitutionally and by Law Enforcement. They allow it and protect it. They must go in November along with Trump!
And there it is the beginning of Trump refusing to leave the whitehouse. He wants schools to reopen now, but it‚Äôs not going to be safe to vote in November?? FASCIST PIG!!!
You'll just try to calm those waters and lower the temp so you and your corporate donors can continue to fleece us.  You are no better than Trump.
You are no better. Corrupt, only interested in holding up to your corporate supporters...  You stand for yourself, not the people. You are just as bad as Trump.
Mr Trump in some areas such as mine (which is very rural) Having any other types of absentee voting is not even possible. You can pick up your ballot or it can be mailed to you but you must return it by mail only! I am in a deep "RED Controlled" area. So stop being #CryBabyTrump

Sometimes I think I could be a Trump Democrat minus the racism. It was Mitch McConnell that messed him up and I worry so much about war and volcanoes. My generation will be authoritarians with hopeful strong pro union tendencies. The room for error is small and dictates it.

The scientist said something on the news tonight that was astounding 150,000 people that have died were disposable to trump that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt care to help makes perfect sense
Watch this about trump.
And that is Biden's fault, for being a shit candidate and being just as corrupt as Trump. Biden is part of the same problem and will NOT help the people. He's already said himself that things won't fundamentally change if he were pres.  Go fly a kite with your vote shaming crap.
So you‚Äôre saying any other race than white doesn‚Äôt have a suburban lifestyle dream? Not everyone in America wants to live nut to butt. And how is Trump racist? People like you and the far far left are making all Democrats look bad.

Biden and the Dem Party are no better than Trump and the Repubs. They simply hide it better with pretty words and empty promises that they spout to lure people in that are naive enough to believe them.   He is JUST as corrupt.   He IS the same.  The choice is fascism and fascism.
Donald Trump desperately pleading for white people in the burbs to save him by demonizing poor black people.  I don't think it's gonna happen Donny boy.

Trump went to India in February and made this deal while there.   He saw the magnitude of fear of COVID-19 then   He violated the emoluments clause by cornering the market on hydroxychloroquine 50 million units.  Make money off it, to hell with stopping its spread!

Democrats refuse to acknowledge lawlessness because it doesn't fit their agenda. They can't back Trump by allowing help to these cities or he may be reelected...so I guess they decided the people living there are on their own...say no to Joe
The DSM-5 criteria of narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, entitlement, and lack of empathy.¬†Yep that pretty much sums up Trump.

One that is trash: covid is hoax propagated by Democrats to topple trump with the aim to reestablish global elites (Clintons and their allies) in power as to unite a one world government eventually controlled by Illuminati (global elites).
Why does Trump have better approval ratings? We don't have a national strategy to combat #COVID19. He hasn't asked for more funding so that every American can get tested. He hasn't asked Congress for a law requiring #COVID19 pts to be quarantined! #TrumpIsALoser
The combination of Zinc, HCQ, and Azithromycin has been used all around the world, effectively, somehow because Trump promoted it, it's the devil.

I'm just trying to show everyone that we don't need to be disrespectful towards others. Trump does that. I was raised that behavior like that was unacceptable behavior. Treat everyone with respect, period. The old, "Treat others the way you won't to be treated" way of thinking.
Your opinion means nothing to me. You don't know me so you have no proof to make such disrespectful claims. But of course a strong Trump supporter has no problem being disrespectful towards others. Go learn respect and get some morals. Then come talk to me.

Ya, that's the strategy we have to get certain Republicans or realistically Democrats to not vote for McConnell who may vote for Trump.
I also loved when the guy was telling Barr, Supurb or not supurb....when asked about Trump not wearing a mask or telling ppl to wear a mask...Barr said then or now?
No, I'm not sitting it out, just refusing to support either Biden or Trump.
I'm very confused wan't it Trump that cleared Lafayette Park?
Not good enough. Biden is just as bad as Trump, as the Dems are no different in their corruption than Repubs. Electing  won't make a goddamn difference for the people.
Trump doesn't have coat tails. Trump went to Lexington and increased Democrat turnout enough for Beshear to win.  Many wouldn't vote for Bevin because of cuts to welfare programs, Massie and McConnell are in the same situation.
Dude I can't stand Trump at all. I think he belongs in prison. But ultimately people are entitled to their own opinions. If we start holding people's opinions against them at that level, we are no better than Trump. Hatred is what he is enticing. Don't bend down to his level!

I AM an informed voter. That's why I'll never support Trump OR Biden. Great job in assuming someone with a different opinion than you is ignorant.   What arrogance...nice.
And in a relationship between a president and vice president, I like that Kamala Harris called it like she saw it. Does Biden intend to be like Trump and only surround himself with yes men. I hate to say it if that's the case maybe Biden should take a cognitive test.
if it actually makes any difference w/ selection process maybe it shows Biden is small or surrounded by small minded people. &amp; that could be problematic on a debate stage w/ Trump. Leaking is bad. This is not good for the party. If it came from Dodd. BOO!
A lot of universities due to budget cuts, I understand the frustration, are funded by students who enter into the United States and pay a much higher tuition costs.  Then Trump decided to expel them from the nation, this will cost local universities dearly. My guts says 1 closes.
We forget nothing. We aren't looking for anyone to "beg" us. We're looking for a candidate we can actually support...NOT more of the same bullshit.  Biden is just as bad as Trump. The Dems are no different from the Repubs. We won't support them.
The Dem party is part of the problem, too. Don't make them out to be something better than Trump and the Republicans. They're NOT.  Both are corrupt. Neither gives a damn about the people.

We're actually falling out of a weird period hopefully back into a more normal period. Most of us, I'm 36 were raised up in extremely unusual times, and you see that even announced today with the Reagan name asking Trump to discontinue use of his likeness. It's about over with.
Is this really how the left perceives Trump? When he ran, he ran on fighting the establishment. We have all known the news was fake/distorted. Brian Williams is a prime example and they brought him back after he admits to lying on air.
It's hard to pick the worst. So many have aided trump in reaching the WH, and in committing the various crimes against our citizens. He didn't come to power alone, and he shouldn't be alone in being stripped of power.
Money? You lose money/following if you support President Trump.
It's not like liberals can't play dress up and pretend to support Trump. They've been doing shit like that for years. They are the KKK.

Oh so you know why he banned him? You were there?  And of course Trump would give information. Exactly what did he provide though? And his motive was probably to hurt someone he was mad at, and to save himself. That‚Äôs his exact MO.
Spoiler alert: if your argument is Trump banned Epstein because he knew what Epstein was doing, that means he did not go to the police. He allowed it to keep occurring.   Morons.
So Trump knew and didn‚Äôt tell the police? Upstanding individual there.
That‚Äôs not why he booted him. They had. A falling out over a property. And he may have booted him only once Epstein was being investigated.   However, using your logic, Trump booted him because he knew he was raping underage girls...and he did nothing but ban him from his resort?

Trump is visiting the Red Cross right now and not donating blood, which is kind of a bummer, because blood donation is very quick and easy and much needed at the moment.   (I realize this is a lot to ask when the guy won't even wear a mask.)
Yeah, Biden‚Äôs a gaffe machine. Although, back then Romney was leaning heavy into the white identity politics. Not to donald trump levels, but he was. But at this point we all know that isn‚Äôt really him. It‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not really popular amongst the Republican base.
‚ù§Ô∏è  you should be the president of my country, you're a lot better than Donald Trump, and I have more respect for you anyway. plus, your ideas are totally brilliant, so I look up to you even more. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Chickens have come home to roost. Mimicking racist rapist dumb narcissistic Nazi dear leader, Herman Caine rejected mask and social distancing hence became Trump Virus statistics, a death cult foolish Uncle Tom negro listened to his white evil master.
That explains why Trump is against it.
We need to sound the alarm: Trump could refuse to accept defeat. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm joining #ProtectTheResults:

Trump: It's too dangerous to vote in person on November 3rd.  Also Trump: Teachers and students get back in the classroom, everything is fine.
So basically, Trump asked the Ukraine to rig the election, then claimed other people were doing the same, and he's asking for a delay until we have a COVID vaccine so he can claim he was the one who made it happen. He'll claim fraud when he loses.
And as we all know, Trump is a stickler for the facts
President Trump says second stimulus check ‚Äòmay go higher‚Äô than $1,200
So basically, Trump asked the Ukraine to rig the election for him to win, now he realizes he's trending to lose and even if he does, he's going to reject election results, and now he wants to delay until COVID is gone and he can claim that as his victory
If you vote for Donald Trump you are hitching your wagon to a fascist and rejecting all principles of the enlightenment and the founding of America (distinguish ideals from history). It is simply accurate to describe someone who is still voting Trump as sympathetic to fascism
America may not be a fascist country because of our strong civic institutions, but Donald Trump himself and many of his staff are pretty much the definition of fascists (insofar as there is one), and you don‚Äôt know anything about fascism if that isn‚Äôt obvious to you

Trump‚Äôs New COVID Doctor Says Sex With Demons Makes You Sick

Hey Ted... not for nothing, but as glad as I am that you're demanding Trump act like an actual president, you and I both know the futility of you making these demands of him. Why not put some work into promoting progressive Senate and House candidates instead?
If it makes you feel better, Trump retweeted a video showing doctors spreading lies about Covid. One doctor claims female problems are caused by sex with demons. Trump ended his ‚Äúpress briefing?‚Äù or whatever he calls them, when Kaitlan Collins asked a Trump a ? about the doctor.
I'm really sorry and I'll gladly try and help you in any way I can but Trump didn't do this to you China did. Would you like to speak directly so I can see hoe best I can help you?
That's because it's heartbreaking and it shouldn't have happened but the Media and Democrats have poisoned the minds of so many with their lies about Trump supporters we're now being gunned down. They own this murder!
It's no surprise that Russia would back the Taliban under the table. After all, we backed the Mujahideen when the Russians invaded Afghanistan. What is inexplicable is that Trump does not seem to be bothered by it, is not protesting it, or even raising the issue with Putin.

First of all, you mentioned the Democrats, so stop acting all obtuse like you have no idea what people are talking about. Also, why was the last time BLM was around was in 2016? Im not a Trump fan at all, and I hope he gets unseated- but I‚Äôd be foolish to not see the relation

Don Surber: Democrats killed thousands to get back at Trump
This is the most concise package of the Trump administration's corruption.  Retweet.  Vote.
I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever done or not done something because any president did or didn‚Äôt. Media talks about people‚Äôs rights then blame Trump for people making their own choices? Crazy
Christians, if for no other reason, this is why you must reelect President Trump.

Jingoistic American dimwits have no clue China had beat them in every step. Case in point, Americans can never match Shanghai Maglev high speed Train traveling at 267 MPH. America can boast about Trump virus that killed 150,000 rabid US dogs.

Both Nicki and Trump could care less
The cupboards were bare, Obama didn't restock needed medical supplies either.......but he did leave detailed plans  how to handle Pandemic. But since it's Obama, Trump can ignore, and it's OK.
Justice is channeling Trump, who also says things are so great.
There you go again  pretending that you are relevant. You can stop, Trump is not going to dump Q-tip for you.

Agree with everything said here: 1. If Big Cat is an big part of Barstool (Which yeah, he is.) then he should of been told.  2. Most people who say they want politics out of sports at the same time likely applaud NASCAR for letting Trump go the the 500 and other events.

Do y‚Äôall think Biden knows that people are only voting for him because he‚Äôs not Trump? Or do you think he legit thinks he‚Äôs popular and a good candidate?
Don Surber: Democrats killed thousands to get back at Trump
First of all, the fact Trump took a cognitive test is stunning. That means they felt like they had to test him. Second, Trump proves his mental illness through his narcissistic braggadocio. Third, Biden saying million instead of thousand does not compare to Trump‚Äôs incoherency.
Ha "politics aren't allowed in school" yeah right?!? the students ask questions and even if they don't your politics affect how you teach. I see that from the Trump supporters and highly religious teachers at my elementary school.

They are perfect, for they expose  shortcomings as president and I thank them for it. How the Lincoln Project's brutal anti-Trump ads could remake US politics
Yes, he could, but there will be a price to be paid politically for doing so. Trump says he could send as many as 75,000 federal agents to US cities
I concur. Trump's briefings were meant to show him in charge -- now they are becoming absurd
#Trump &amp; the GOP are trying to just wish away the pandemic and its serious consequences. Schools don't have the funds to reopen and we are on the precipice of the biggest health care crisis in a century.
üòÇüòÇ he would do what? Protect American citizens from violent crimes and clean up cities that Democrat government has beat down for decades? If that's what you call a warning, you must be a criminal! I call it a promise kept! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ hell yes! TRUMP 2020! I want 2 more terms!!
