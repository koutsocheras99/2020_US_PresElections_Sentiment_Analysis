Trump has in only 3 1/2yrs! Dems couldn't do it in 50+. Obama only empowered our enemies both foreign &amp; domestic for 8yrs.
Trump does plenty of damage to himself. Anything McConnell does or doesn't do is just gravy on top
Apparently putting kids through months of this is just fine by Trump's way of thinking, but he's afraid to have their parents stand in line for part of one day to vote in the presidential election?  *sniff* *sniff*  Smells like bull****.
Problem is, then they will be legally forced to approve other murals....Trump, Hitler, Putin....they can not discriminate. Their hands were tied as a Council. Better to remove this one than to open Pandora‚Äôs box.

So it seems like a more productive strategy for progressive to be more calculated and strategic about pushing him in that direction. Just clapping back and treating him the same way we do Trump is why we lose and our ideas have zero shot
A President trying to deflect attention from the 33% drop in GDP today. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Focus on the worst economy in American history, all thanks to Trump incompetence. He wants to hide that with sensational nonsense. Don‚Äôt let him!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpEconomyDisaster
So what? It‚Äôs trump‚Äôs money he should be able to do what he wants with it. He knows what‚Äôs best.
I feel deep inside that I need to do everything in my tiny human capacity to get rid of Trump. Everything else seems secondary. Republicans beat us not because of their policy but because they are willing to stomach more for their fucked idea of the greater good.
I don't necessarily know the context, but in what way was Obama more restricted than Trump?  (Not voting for Trump, just seems like no president has ever had the same extent of opposition from the media)
My Rep Kevin Hern‚Äôs staff called me today and that was one of my concerns was whether Biden would debate Trump.  She said they are planning for a first debate but she didnt know when.  And my other concern was prosecuting Ilhan Omar, stripping her citizenship &amp; deportation.

I understand the extremist rioters don't like Biden.  My point was that bringing in National Guard and Federal Troops without their hands tied behind their backs WILL stop the violence imo.  These governors and mayors are rejecting solutions because Trump is behind the wheel imo.
Trump‚Äôs Sudden Photo-Op Just Happened To Be During Obama's John Lewis Eulogy
41,000+new confirmed cases 800+more deaths in last 9 hrs.   Yet the  do NOTHING! The death toll continues to grow. We‚Äôve now DOUBLED our 58,220 dead in Vietnam - DOUBLED now over 155k Trump had ‚Äòbone spurs‚Äô during Vietnam &amp; now MIA. This is disgusting!
It's sort of interesting to me because, while I think more riots will happen if Trump is elected, I think Trump is more likely to take care of them than Biden  On the other hand, Dem cities would actually let Biden take care of the issue if he so chose, so that might be better.
When Biden is safely  Ensconced in the White House can we stop talking about Trump. Please. üòî  I'm so tired.
Stitt is manipulating the data for Trump. Oklahoma kids and teachers are going to die.
He chose to go to the rally no one forced him. However Trump was not a good example of how to prevent coronavirus from spreading.
I have been a republican for years, and so far to be honest Trump is the only one actually doing things other Presidents have been scared to do. The reason they have been scared is all the political crap involved.
Like I said, Biden is much less Libertarian than Trump (Low Bar)  If you don't realize that, then you don't know anything about Libertarianism.  It's why Libertarians tend to swing right.
I‚Äôm no billionaire, however I do know that Trump is the only president actually following through with his campaign promises. My life is actually better now. I don‚Äôt care who is in office, I am going to make my life better because I choose to do so.

I've stated multiple times that I don't like Trump and he may be a racist, but somehow you take that as me "talking up" Trump?  I'm just shitting on Biden.  It's not the same thing even though the establishment has brainwashed you into thinking such.
Hope you watched Bush, Clinton, and Obama today...you will never be a tenth part of any of them. You will be a minor footnote when they write the damning history of Trump.
A gift from Trump, I guess, the worst disaster to ever hit America.
Keep asking hard questions. He‚Äôs Oklahoma‚Äôs trump.
Tulsa rally with Trump that‚Äôs what happened no mask no protection and he wanted to please trump and risk his life for it. I‚Äôve not seen Trump people say a word about it today but they don‚Äôt care. There will be many casualties and Trump will say he‚Äôs doing a good job. üò≥
Btw, Trump (who I disdain to an extent) is closer to Libertarianism than Bernie's platform that Biden is running on.  It's a far Left platform.
He doesn‚Äôt understand that Trump is going down. Oklahoma can not save him. And he will drag Stitt down the next governor‚Äôs race because Stitt will be clobbered with Oklahoma deaths.
I am more inclined to think that Calabresi sees a GOP wipeout due to trumpism and notwithstanding the fact he rode the trump train until now he wants off to position himself to influence in the new Conservative party. He‚Äôs a hateful, selfish bastard. So fuck that guy!

He's still a much better person than the establishment prick you're pushing.  You go for pragmatism over morality.  That's fine, but don't pretend what Trump has done is immoral if morality isn't even your main incentive on who to vote for.
He went knowing the risks. Although I'm not letting trump off the hook..
Only idiots would believe this tweet. You are replacing old wall. A little over 200 miles of outdated wall and a little over 3 miles of new wall. People do unbiased research. Trump is nothing more than a liar and thief.
I didn't say he was.  I said I wouldn't put it past him.  See, I don't hold an idealistic view on any of these people, and the idea of Trump being a racist doesn't seem totally ridiculous to me (Given how most elites behave behind closed doors)
What if they were both equally racist?  Biden has said worse shit than Trump, but I wouldn't put it past Trump being a legit racist.
He was VP during Obama's war-crimes, but I don't hold that against him.  He just never vocalized a disagreement when Obama started killing innocents with drones.  (Btw, Trump is guilty of a similar thing in Yemen)
That‚Äôs a lame ass reply. How many times have Trump‚Äôs minions tried to explain away what he says?? Don‚Äôt you understand sarcasm? He was just messin‚Äô with you! Can‚Äôt you take a joke?? Because they cannot defend him. There is no defense.

When the time comes, Trump will have to be buried in an undisclosed location or the upkeep will be horrendous!!!
Then he throws out a conspiracy theory that the White House coronavirus Task Force identifying Oklahoma as a concerning hot spot is an attack on President Trump and the state.
Also, if the results are in question and the constitution terminated his term, and Trump and Pence leave the Whitehouse, then it will fall to Nancy Pelosi to fill in as President.  Yeah, stupid.   ... try to fight that.
You can‚Äôt blame Trump for something that happens to someone else. That‚Äôs like saying what happens to you is Trunps fault. Obviously you do what you want anyway. So you are proof people make their own minds up

Did you happen to mention how he died? Was it the Trump Virus??
Hey moron, Trump doesn‚Äôt control everyone as a puppet. To say Herman Cain would have worn a mask if Trump did is obviously an idiotic remark. Another thing how about those that wear masks and still get COVID-19? That happens as well
No the economy isn't coming back yet Trump.
All of us have said this racist would try this.
Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt control everyone. Your comment is ridiculous and stupid.
"The resistance to this idea among Republicans is overwhelming." üëàüèª that is a completely unnecessary cheap shot against Trump that will be used against him.   This is why Republicans get their asses kicked like little bitches. They don't have any idea how to play the enemy.
Just wait. Trump will ask, "WHAT is the Federa List Society? Is that a 'Good' List. Or a 'Bad List? Am I ON the List?? I dunno. It's probably a very 'GOOD LIST'. Yeah. I am...or SHOULD be!! *Fine People* I don't know them, though. I've heard GOOD Things! Probably are."üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Just a fact. You are a hateful shrew. Trump is not at fault for Hernan‚Äôs death.

So who are you. Such a shrew. Go have supper with Bush and get out of the Trump party.  Boy would I love to see election delayed just to shut you up!  Cheney. Liz. Ugh
I did not see Trump‚Äôs rant. Can someone fill me in? This October surprise has to be Durham. It won‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs all a tissue of lies. It will just be for distraction. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to change anyone‚Äôs mind by that point. They know he is desperate.
How does she know he got the CV virus in Tulsa? He came here from Georgia and went through airports.   Nor does the mask stop the CV. People who wear masks have contracted the CV.   They are just pulling all this out of their asses because they are terrified of the Trump rallies
She doesn't get it at all. Look at how she started off her tweet.   Why can't these humorless Republicans wake up to the nature of the enemy? President Trump understands the devil hates to be mocked; Republicans don't get that.
Trump didn‚Äôt send a letter. He knew even that would have been booed.

A good lawyer would be able to prove gross negligence on the part of the campaign.  His estate should sue Trump 2020, the State of OK, and the City of Tulsa as all were willing parts of the negligence
That he probably picked up at Trump‚Äôs bust of a rally in Tulsa.
Awesome job  We need you to take care of the real IC whistleblowers who reported internal wrongdoing . . .
#COVIDBaggers following Trump like lemmings. Virus-ridden lemmings.
I've never voted in my life until trump. I knew they were cheap door to door salesmen . With their polished appearance and suave speeches. This is spiritual not political. I hope you can be objective. I'm a history buff.. and we are marching towards communism...
Yea, beware tRump and Putin are up to something!üò°
I'm always objective..  i was an independent never voted before trump.  My I.Q. is off this chart... and  I'm on here arguing with idiots.. I'm just trying to enlighten people. We've all been exposed to different information.  And yet we say your stupid for not agreeing...
Herman Cain died after attending a worthless trump rally in Tulsa Oklahoma.
Obama, eulogizing John Lewis, takes aim at Trump over voting rights, protest responses.
Yep, the MSM tells us everything that's bad in the world and that it's all Trump's fault...figured I'd sum that up.
They know they have the government by the balls bc this is being rushed to try and stop the economic bleeding that makes trump look so bad.
Do you doubt that if Trump could be a dictator,¬†he would be? Do you doubt it is his intention to cheat America‚Äôs voters again?¬†Do you dare dismiss his disregard of the Constitution given his track record?
Moral code is don't drive anywhere...you could be involved in an accident.  And kill someone and then your a murderer.  My goodness it's astounding how little people really know about epidemiology. and all the sudden they're experts on here. But that's ok hate trump ....
What do you think the most outrageous thing Trump will do leading up to the election?
Like 150,000 other people, his death certificate should read, "Cause of death: Donald J. Trump"
Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election

Lunatics are saying, without evidence, that Herman Cain died from being at a Trump rally. He lived in GA and went through airports to get to Tulsa. Nor do masks prevent the CV.   via
Then when are you going to resolve the outstanding issues with my case and hold the IGs accountable for their failures instead of covering up for them?   absent resolution, I will have no choice but to publicly expose everything.
Trump's economy has crashed.
Trump trying to buy your vote?  President Donald Trump said Wednesday he wants the next coronavirus relief package to be "very generous" with direct stimulus payments to Americans that are potentially more than $1,200.  "It may go higher than that, actually," Trump said.
They don‚Äôt give one shit about black lives or any lives. They are gleeful that #HermanCain died because they imagine it helps them scare people away from Trump rallies.
She has absolutely no evidence that #hermancain picked it up at a Trump rally.   That is pure wishful thinking on the part of the lying lunatic left.
Herman Cain died from COVID-19.  He tested positive shortly after the Tulsa Trump rally.  Conservatives on Twitter say there's no proof he got it there,  yet the same people believe #pizzagate is obviously true.  #mentalgymnastics #RIPHermanCain
If there's a time the Russian "pee-pee" tapes and the Apprentice's tapes of Trump's racist diatribes should hit the airwaves, it's in October. Where are the whistleblowers when we need them?
These are just the cases we know about #VoterFraud and let me guess, most if not all are for  Just like the 1960 presidential election which had serious voter fraud issues in Chicago, IL . . .
tRump could not dealing our election and stop vote by mail because some states has it for long time,  he is not an American he is opportunist as KKK like his father who arrested on June 1st 1927 while 80 percent of American are not happy with him
I can hear the Trump campaign rolling over in its grave right now.  This is what a President should sound like.  Not a better person to give this eulogy...   #JohnLewisFuneral
And if he allows Trump to circumvent federal statute law (and Constitution) he should be removed by any means necessary.  Maybe we should force him to visit Louie Gohmert so they can have a COVID party
I had no idea that Tulsa, OK was the only place in the US to get CV... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÅ  What I do know is that the left is deathly afraid of Trump rallies and will say and do anything to scare people away while they support massive riots.  So excuse me when I call bullshit. ü§®
You can't reason with or persuade inveterate fools, the #MAGA crowd, the #KAG2020 cult, so I just block them so I don't have to listen to idiocy (unless I try to listen to Trump at a press conference, but I usually skip that, too)
Good luck with your‚Äòratings‚Äô, Trump
Terrible shame on trump
Now he‚Äôs saying to wear goggles so sheep goggles will be the rage now.
Lairs like Turkey trump
I wonder if the tRump family has these discussions...
Great job he did , tRump need to that too as his father was arrested as a KKK on June 1st  In 1927  and he is follo him
To my democrat ‚Äúfriends;‚Äù prepare to be disappointed once again when Trump kicks your ass.   You should have learned your lesson with Hillary but you did not. When you run a lousy candidate and attack Americans, you LOSE.
Trump prefers the medical advice of this woman over Dr. Fauci.
He has on those Trump goggles, always!
USPS is intentionally understaffed right now, during a busy mail season. New Trump-appointed Postmaster General is Betsy DeVos-ing the nation‚Äôs oldest institution.
You need to dive into how BIG of a trump SYCOPHANT  is.     And Jimmy's insider trading!!!!!
Shame on Turkey tRump

Trump suggests delaying 2020 US presidential election due to concerns over mail-in voting fraud
How long has Trump been in power? Even if what you say is true, he has over 3 years to prepare. And failed. Now we have 150,000+ Americans dead.
If it's necessary to delay an election, then delay it and vote in person with a certified I.D. To much Fraud in mail in voting. I totally agree with our President. Trump 2020 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
A black man died and all of you bitch about Trump, calling Harmon ignorant, its has own fault and you want to sit their and call Republicans racist, wow wtf, your tweets prove the true haters and true racist.
It'd be much easier to tell when Trump is joking about something if we had ever seen him laugh at anything. It's pretty hard to play the joke card on things that are marginally worse than things he's proposed with absolutely seriousness.
I guess this is what WINNING looks like to Trump and the Republican Party. Just keep screwing America.
I see a scenario where Trump secretly leaves the USA for a country without an extradition treaty.
What's wild is how counterintuitive to his reelection it is. Older people are the ones who need mail-in voting the most during a pandemic, but they're also the ones most likely to listen to Trump. So either they won't vote(for Trump), or they'll go vote and put themselves  risk
According to PBS there was ( and it was thrown out.

So dumb. Trump is not terrified of anything because he‚Äôs a rich old white guy who has had everything he has ever wanted or needed in life handed to him or served up to him. He will die a rich old white guy. Just like his old man. Just like his sons will. That‚Äôs how America works.

Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election
Hey you hot sack of shit. Remember when you wrote an opinion article about Biden saying Trump would try to delay the elections? How is your Boomer brain reconciling the presidential tweet this morning?
Trump will NOT be able to delay the election. Congress could, thus we‚Äôd have #PresidentPelosi That‚Äôs why  will not go for the idea.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Of course he  will.
All you need to do is listen to the radio broadcasts of Hannity, Levin, Limbaugh et al. They are spreading the doomsday message now and will throw gas on the fire when/if trump loses.
What does #putin have over Trump?

Laura Ingraham hammers Democrats over 'deafening silence' after Black Trump supporter murdered   Dems care not about blacks killing blacks. If Biden wins it will get even worse. The media and left only use black killings if it suits their agenda

I would take Dick Cheney over trump

He fell ill from Covid-19 a few days after attending the Trump Rally here in Tulsa. So maybe it can't be proven 100% but it's like getting pregnant, you most likely know who the father is.
donald trump isn't gonna fuck you bro
One of the saddest parts is that Trump has yet to recognize his death. Herman Cain‚Äôs loyalty could very well be the reason for his death yet there is no loyalty in return. We need a president whose focus is in others and not his personal gain. #RepublicansForBiden #Election2020
As a sure sign that trump is killing the humanity even in those that oppose him, I have ZERO fucks to give for Herman Cain. He and his ilk deserve anything that happens to them.  here's to you travelling the same road as Herman.
Really? What will Biden do about the pandemic that trump has t done?  Trump didn‚Äôt cause any segregation! Biden put into law the largest segregation of African Americans in prison. Ask schiff what he knew about the bounties back in feb.
Two weeks before being hospitalized for COVID-19, he attended President Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Trump is still going to landslide Ohio. And any other state with mandatory masks &amp; forced medications.
Donald Trump do anything and it makes the news lol
What do you think about Herman Cain dying from Corona Virus he contacted at Tulsa Trump Rally?
Hey Henry. It doesn't look so false after all does it. Trump is talking about this exact thing today. I think you owe someone an apology. Biden was spot on and you were dead wrong!
I can not mourn this man‚Äôs death very much. He went to trumps rally with no social distancing and no masks. He followed trump examples and it killed him #magadeath #TrumpKillsAmericans

I've come to a conclusion about the Trump supporters! There are two groups! First group says Trump is a terrible person but I am doing well, so I will vote for him! Second group says Trump is horrible but he's not Hillary Clinton so I will vote for him! Lol!
Wait did someone say Trump's not leaving???? Huh
Trump has planted this dumb idea that mail in ballots are BAD and now even if he doesn‚Äôt succeed in postponing the election and somehow Biden wins there will be a seed of unreliability in the voting process. His followers won‚Äôt believe it was a fair election. This is dangerous.
NO! WE LOST! üëÄ AT WHO IS SUFFERING AFTER TRUMPüá∑üá∫ STOLEN PRESIDENCY!
And if he tries it, the US Constitution says he and Pence are OUT of office on January 20, 2021,  is next in line to the presidency until the election is held. That‚Äôs why Congress would never permit that to happen. Trump is fully delusional. OR welcome #PresPelosi
Him &amp; 6k otherdumb asses rolled into Tulsa for Trump's rally &amp; laughed the whole time, while the vast majority of people living here (which is like 90% hard right leaning) stayed hunkered down because even the most rabid people I know are scared of the virus.  Can't fix stupid
Hey Jonathan, you see what Trump is talking about today? Delaying the election. Looks like Biden was on to something.
The leftists will use Herman Cain's death to discourage Trump rallies because they are terrified of them.  They don't give a shit about anyone who dies of CV. They care about politics.

See Herman Cain circled on right at the Trump virus super spreader event in Tulsa Ok. Gov Stitt, Senator Inhofe, Senator Lankford can also be seen in this photo from the Trump Rally June 2020 Gov sTitt then got the Trump Rally Virus
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Yes, delay the election until January 21st.  That way, per the constitution, Pelosi takes over as President.  Trump is gone.  Problem solved.
See Herman Cain circled on right at the Trump virus super spreader event in Tulsa Ok. Gov Stitt, Senator Inhofe, Senator Lankford can also be seen in this photo from the Trump Rally June 2020 Gov STitt diagnosed with TrumpRallyVirus 3 weeks after standing next to Cain mouth open
President  has suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election. What do you think?
See Herman Cain circled on right at the Trump virus super spreader event in Tulsa Ok. Gov Stitt, Senator Inhofe, Senator Lankford can also be seen in this photo from the Trump Rally June 2020. Ok Gov Stitt got the Trump rally virus after the event too.
Trump floats delaying election over mail-in voting, legal experts say that power rests with Congress
To believe this we would have to believe:   a) you can only get China virus in Tulsa, OK even though we have a very low rate    b) masks can stop the CV [they don't]  I call bullshit...   The real agenda is the dems DESPERATION to stop Trump rallies.  #HermanCain HermanCain
Pretty much sums it up...
Rightfully so. Trump holding the rally in Tulsa was irresponsible and everyone knew that.
Herman Cain: His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, tweeted a photo of himself without a mask at the event, which was attended by several thousand people.
Trump says that you shouldn‚Äôt worry because he‚Äôs going to cancel election so he can keep on doing all the things that got us here. ü§™

Yep, two thing worth noting about trumps rally. The second thing is  Say my name...  TULSA ENDED TRUMP.
That is correct. Trump is more self interest through special interest.
People who straddle line in parking lot so no one can park next to them. Usually a Cadillac with Trump bumper sticker.
#TrumpRecession #TrumpVirus #TrumpThreatensAmerica   Trump must be arrest, tried for treason and suffer capital punishment if found guilty.
And Trump killed him because his ego needed a rally and people didn‚Äôt wear masks.
Haha.. typo worked out...  Thing trump...
Maybe its just me. I know Trump can't speak very well. But maybe his intention is to delay so people can vote in a booth since our postal service is a circus with 14 days or more ballot turn around time.

The hypocrisy by the Right is mind blowing. Had Barack Obama suggested anything like this or dozens of other things Trump has said or done they would have flipped their shit!! Yet they take it up the ass by Trump no problem.
Thing trump will say shit about Cain!
People should be focusing on Cain dying and the virus. Not the new/same old distraction.  Trump,  and  are FULLY responsible for Herman Caines death.
Hey  since trump is starting his propaganda campaign again on the election,  we‚Äôre are your supposed election security bills?   Oh that‚Äôs right. You are a failure.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.

DO NOT FALL FOR THIS DISTRACTION! We have 150,000 Dead Americans because of Trump's lack of leadership.
Man, I can't deal with Trump. I went to try to read his tweets because it seems like he might have said something that needs attention BUT I COULD NOT READ THE FUCKING PRESIDENT'S TWEETS BECAUSE I HAD A PANIC ATTACK.
Covid-19 does not know borders. It is NOT the China virus.  It is a pandemic that you allowed to spread. Feb. 26 Trump: "You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero,‚Äù We now have over 150,000 Dead Americans.
This is so sad...as it didn‚Äôt have to happen....local medical professionals begged the Trump campaign to cancel the Tulsa rally....May he Rest In Peace....

This is a dumb take by Trump but I'd like to see polling on how populus feels about it. If a majority of Americans feel mail-in voting does not secure their vote and if a majority of Americans feel the virus is a risk for in-person voting, something has to give one way or another

Ain't that the truth.  But I distrust HHS more than CDC because the Occupier in Chief has more control over it.  The moment he wanted to stop sending CDC the testing data from states...  I sensed a desire to manipulate the data for Trump's benefit.

Trump believes in repentance. Obviously you don‚Äôt understand what he saying now. He talks about Jesus and about being a Christian now. If he wasn‚Äôt before that‚Äôs OK. Jesus has forgiven him for everything he‚Äôs done before.

Mary Trump and Jack O‚ÄôDonnell are spreading lies about Donald Trump. To believe people that never liked him and say the most ridiculous things is wrong.

He never did that. He never discriminated against black Americans but not renting to them. Again that‚Äôs a liberal lie that they want to bring up. If Trump were racist he would not have Ben Carson And even other black leaders that like him. He‚Äôs no racist

There's no political will to stop this madman but don't underestimate the American people. Trump was correct in running to the bunker sensing danger from the mob.
Trump did not say Clorox and Lysol will work. He said leave it up to the medical professionals. HCQ works. Look at the other countries that are using the medicine it does work
Let me also say that for those businesses or places that do discriminate and use this to discriminate, they will be handled by the administration in a way they don‚Äôt like. Trump is no racist, and he will not tolerate that

watch it then watch it again then send it to a trump supporter
Trump is a descendent of Judas Iscariot and Scott Baio is the grandson of Adolf Eichmann. Trump also raped and murdered Macaulay Culkin after Home Alone 2, which is why he wasn‚Äôt in the third one and who you see now is just one of those clones. No sources. Do your research.
This is why I just laugh when Trump supporters/conservatives complain about FAKE NEWS. It‚Äôs not about whether it‚Äôs true or not...it‚Äôs about whether or not they like it or not.
President Trump lashed out at social media companies for labeling Dr. Stella Immanuel‚Äôs comments as misinformation and for removing the video showing her and a group of doctors.
Did I not tell you.....WE will remember who backed Trump and they will be voted OUT and REMOVED!!!!!
How can anyone think trump is decisive and strong when he changes his message every day.  He tweets dangerous information from questionable sources saying how great the person, then says he doesn't know anything about the person when confronted?
Trump calls this woman very impressive. She talks about sex with witches &amp; demons. Medical conditions being caused by witches, alien DNA being used in med. treatments.
He was supposed to be on the Trump plane to Midland TX so trump tested him before he could fly...

Trump calls "very impressive" a person who thinks alien DNA is being used in medical treatment, talks about having sex with witches and demons. Medical conditions caused by witches. God save us. #WakeUpAmerica Trump and his conspiracies must go.
Good advice  Trump doesnt debate.  He just throws out words.
Money (at our expense) is always Trump's priority.
Did Trump just reveal the secret to Area 51?
I later heard it was a stunt to upset the left, but I think they were floating the idea as a test just like Trump has done numerous times himself. ü§¨
You know Trump HATES brown people, right? I guess self-hate is a real thing.
I can't believe Trump thinks he can make age an issue. Biden hasn't been asked to test for dementia. Trump has.

Remember our talks about redlining and how it wasn't until the 60s and 70s that the practice was finally halted?  Donald Trump's very first appearance in a newspaper was when he settled with HUD for violating fair housing laws and discriminating against non-white people.
You‚Äôre so politically wise Ryan. You have channeled the disgust middle class suburbanites have toward poor people and how sneering at them is actually smart. Awful and desperate! But smart. I‚Äôm sure you will continue to talk about this when Trump gets beaten in 3 months
The Election is coming up-Don‚Äôt believe the lies this time! Do you know Putin wants TRUMP to win because he does not punish him for killing our troops and they are selling arms to the Taliban to kill people! It‚Äôs time to get rid of Trump and vote for Joe Biden!!

Crazy that Trump officials aren‚Äôt on every news network throwing the fiscal conservatives under the bus with a ‚ÄúNew GOP equipped to deal with this virus‚Äù message. They really ain‚Äôt trying to win.

If I have learned anything from the last 4 years, it‚Äôs that there is no bottom for the GOP. Trump could strip buck naked at the podium while singing the Russian national anthem and they would rush to his defense.

I found his speech very hypocritical . Remember when Obama used tear gas, rubber bullets and water on natives in freezing cold weather? Those were actual peaceful protestors. What trump is dealing with are actual violent protestors attacking police officers and federal property.
He has zero chance of getting elected if he doesn‚Äôt debate BDD. Trump will completely destroy Biden though if they do debate.

Let's not pretend that Biden is an even decent candidate. He's simply "not Trump". That's his redeeming quality.
I hate to say it but anybody who supports Trump I have to assume is racist. Am I wrong, coach?
Don't think he's asking for em to be psychic - just to actually act accordingly as information becomes available. If Trump's that worried about mail-in ballots, common sense would dictate you strengthen the entity tasked with getting said ballots where they need to go on time.
I think that says something to the blind trust, or at least the facade of public support, that the RNC has given to Trump.  Just like 2016, I would've rather had almost any other candidate - like you, but there are only 2. So I will be reluctantly supporting Biden.
Trump won today. Everybody focused on that one stupid tweet.  He knows very well that moving the election is 100% a 0% possibility. Yet the media ran with it like a greyhound chasing a fake rabbit.

I do offer my sympathies to the family of Herman Cain. He fought for what he thought was right. On the other hand, Donald Trump knew what was wrong and did it anyway in a supreme act of self promotion. In short, he believed in his own lies and people died because of it.
The problem is that Bush's awfulness doesn't even touch Trump's. There are different levels of bad.  I never liked Bush, but I will take him back in a second.

This may be the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read. Catching a virus when you are in a vulnerable state and being murdered are completely different. If you think Trump never existing would ensure Herman would still be alive, then you are living in a deranged world dude.
Trump‚Äôs base.
if you think  is a poor candidate who will work more for Wall St than American people but voting but you fear Trump utterly destroying the country, and so voting #DoNothingJoe and want to contribute give to Settle For Biden to deliver a clear message.
Lindsey Graham, that quote is weak. Only a resounding NO is acceptable for this outrageous suggestion by Trump to delay the election. Shame on you, where is your backbone sir? If you Republicans would stand up to him, just once, you can change things for the better of America.
Stitt responding to letter stating that Oklahoma is not following federal recommendations. He says the letter is a political statement against President Trump and Oklahoma.
And you are a joke.  Enjoy your freedom while you can.  Next year you will be under indictment.  If trump pardons you, the State of New York will get you.  There is no escape.

I miss the Sean Spicer part of the Trump Presidency.
Fact-checking Trump's continued assault on mail-in voting and suggestions of delaying the election
Herman Cain died from covid-19. He was a staunch Trump supporter who refused to wear a mask and talked loudly about it. I wonder if he thought he'd be #dyingforTrump
Read Mary Trump‚Äôs book. Might change your mind about Trump. Not Terry, just Trump.
As true as this is, any person that contracted the virus there then spread it somewhere else, somewhere that Trump wasn‚Äôt involved in and that didn‚Äôt require signing a waiver. Eventually resulting in more deaths of unwilling fools
Herman Cain was an American, and over 21 years old, he chose to live free or die. God bless the Cain family, Trump, and the USA. #Trump2020 #LiveFreeOrDie
If you spent just 15 minutes doing your own research (not bullshit biased media sources like nytimes, Washington post, cbs, or CNN) you would realize that Trump has done a lot more good than harm for this country
Trump could literally bring world peace and people would still criticize him. I find it unbelievable that y‚Äôall are so fixed on this bullshit narrative that Trump is the fucking antichrist. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is/who he is.
Me too, my God we have no other option, but I love what Trump has done. He has been falsely ridiculed. He has been the best POTUS we‚Äôve had in years. He‚Äôs an alpha male.
Good thing for Trump Cain signed that rally waiver.
If trump wins re-election after all of this bs we have been though, I am out.  Not too early to start reminding people.
The founders would have tried Donald Trump, Bill Barr and Mike Pompeo for treason.
That and to hurt Bezos'. Trump is willing to destroy the post office and make America vulnerable to private mail and a likely rural monopoly to satisfy his personal goals and ego. Not the action of a patriotic American.
Listening to Barack Obama is to listen to a President of the United States. Listening to Donald Trump is to listen to a cheap carnival barker working a midway scam.
The worst President to ever exist! #TrumpThreatensAmerica The USA is falling apart and he is doing NOTHING but talking about he wants to postpone the election. UM no we will all DIE if you stay President! You‚Äôre a failure #Trump
i don‚Äôt believe trump has a chance of actually delaying the election, however considering his history of blatantly violating the constitution for personal benefit, i don‚Äôt find it abnormal to be concerned by the suggestion
Wont happen Trump will win in the biggest landslide
Besides being racist and it is 50 years later, the fact the Trump campaign is running on this is so wildy odd to me since this is going on in Trump's America.  He is the president, he owns everything happening in America right now.
If Putin did a shot every time Trump did him a favor the man  wouldn't be able to walk.
Yes, Trump killed Herman Cain. And that happened in Tulsa AND I predicted this death on that day. I hate that I was right.
Agreed, Mr Wyden. I hold him responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. But he is also a mass murderer; more than 150,000 Americans, considered the cost of doing business, to Trump. Dismantling fair housing provisions. ha, what a legacy.
Attention President Trump
Darn trump made him do it!!
This is an honest question.  Trump is just trolling with the whole election delay talk, right?  This is just misdirection. He knows he can't do it, and it would never happen. Right?
Well the overhaul we got by electing Donald Trump was a catastrophe. So sure, let's trust the Louis Dejoy, someone with no experience, overhaul the USPS. My Uncle is a retired Post Master &amp; I was born in the home of the Pony Express. I proudly support the USPS.
He is worried about himself, not us.  No wonder they follow Trump.  #GOP #GOPDeathCult #GOPBetrayedAmerica
Yea because trump aimed the virus at Cain and shot him with it.
So if you ever doubted the wisdom of three branches of government.....two legs of the stool broke off but somehow the courts are balancing it on one leg!    Appeals court will reconsider order to dismiss criminal case of former Trump aide Michael Flynn
Who ever gave the coronavirus to  also gave it to  at the Trulsa Trump Rally.  I wonder who that person was and I wonder if any one else who attended the rally became sick and or died?
Is that from the Trump campaign? Maybe it's a compliment.
Okay. I can‚Äôt think of one Democrat who would delay an election in hopes of causing such chaos and voter depression. Fuck tRump #NeverBidenNoMore
No shame?  Trump led him to his death.  #WeWillVote #NobodyLikesTrump
I imagine the 34% is Trump‚Äôs base.
Trump has never looked well.  Too much hate and racism will do that.  All MAGGOTS are racist and devils. That's the way they roll..  DEVILS
Then by this moronic logic he died because he went to a trump rally then shouldnt everyone who went be dead by now its been 6 weeks. Hmmmm
No way anyone on this earth is as crooked as trump crime family and  GOP.
Trump crime family, crooks.  There I corrected it for ya.  You welcome.
Yeah, because if you support America you‚Äôre more than likely a Trump supporter üòÇ  See the problem here?
Obama is a criminal that spied on Trump campaign  He also spied on Americans He also hated the Police Got 5 Dallas Policemen killed Let the FBI run rouge  and the NSA  He may go to jail
Trump never even actually wanted the job, he actively hates it, but he's gonna have to be dragged out of the White House by a SEAL team because his maniacal brain cannot accept defeat
In the face of destruction of statues and rewriting of history by Democrats. Trump protects peaceful protest and freedom of speech censorship from big tech backed by CCP. This guy has the audacity to glaze over actual human rights violations and goes straight to Trump is hitler.
So do we have any data regarding drone strikes under the Trump administration?
These things are NEVER based on race. Usually just basic economics, and safety. These politicians either know that and dont care because its against their agenda, or are just playing stupid to blame yet something else on Trump.
HE IS ABUSING HIS POWER OF OFFICE LIKE tRUMP AND YOUR THANKING HIM!?! He will never be re-elected! Cult followers geez üôÑ #RepublicansAgainstTrump
George W. started two wars and Obama added 5 more. Trump is the only President in the past 20 years who didn‚Äôt start a war. And Biden voted for the Iraq war. That‚Äôs your candidate.
Ok question, will you lefties and demos accept the results if Trump wins, cause its been almost 4 years now and you haven't accepted the results of 2016.
Because Trump was right
Louis Dejoy is a Trump donor who is trying to dismantle this public service and sell it off for profit. The post office has been broke because they charge $0.36 to send a piece of mail across the country to keep the service affordable.
Hold up, so is Trump... coincidence!?!?!?
Pompeo, Barr and Trump are the new axis of evil
Noone deserves to lose their life to Covid. Only wish all Republicans would take precautions to protect us. Unlike Trump did for him. Trump could've saved his life. Did he take Trumps miracle drug? If so, Drs warned this could happen. Sry for your loss
I just read some assinin tweet from Trump and just want to scream.  I will run walk crawl to vote him out November 3rd.
The left always talking about impeaching trump, he hadn‚Äôt even been elected yet. Y‚Äôall remember that? They‚Äôve never NOT talked endlessly abt it. Will they ever üõë stop?
POTUS Trump is letting Fauci dig his own grave lol, this will give POTUS the ability to kick the WHO and UN out of the USA. Just this vets observation.
Trump with a Braum's logo would end Twitter. (at least in Oklahoma)
They are Trump supporters. See Tucker interview.
Did you forget C-Span exists? Your lying to the American people. Your greediness is beyond comprehension. You did the tax scam, TAKE IT AWAY. Give it to the struggling suffering American people. #GoBigMitch maybe just to try to save yourself. You let Trump bring your party down!
tRump just earned Joe Biden my vote. #NeverBiden no more. Regardless of who is chosen as VP I‚Äôm all in for Biden.
There are likely some Oklahomans who also died from attending the Trump rally. We implored leaders not to go through with this wreckless and now deadly event.
Another victim of Trump's Tulsa, OK rally.
Anyone who is surprised that Rashida wants tRump out of office is pretty new to politics or just an idiot.
The point in general is sending in federal agents into these places for what is clearly a stunt for Trump's election campaign. It isn't as if these agents are doing anything authorities at the city and state level can't do themselves.
Everytime trump has bad news about him, he tweets something to distract. He KNOWS the media (you) will follow him wherever he takes you. He has played you and the media from day one. Rachael Maddow said it best-watch what they do NOT what they say.
You know who needs to go back to school.  trump, he is classless and needs a course on etiquette. #WhyIHateTrump #WhyIDontLikeDonaldTrump
Not in comparison to Trump or yourself, Rudy

It's not "it didn't have to be this bad" but  "this didn't have to happen at all" Trump is the "founder" of coronavirus. I've been a Biden fan for a long time and I'm going to be really pissed if you all screw this up.
Preach President Obama!!! Trump must be hating this..üòä
Trump still doing commercials, Really? Is he ever going to do some presidential work ever?
No.  If Biden wins, it‚Äôs whatever. Biden is not for M4A and will have a swamp Administration beholden to wealthy donors as always.  Sure, I‚Äôd be glad Trump is gone but neither get my vote for many reasons.
Omg Obama hit trump on his post office bullshit
Almost certain that‚Äôs from him attending the Tulsa trump rally...maskless.
I have no confidence in "should not be delayed". There have been many things on his watch that should not have happened, but they did.  Put same bass in your voice, let me know you mean what you say bc it sounds to me like groveling up to tRump.
‚ô•Ô∏è Trump 2020
They are trying to blame Herman Cains death on the Tulsa trump rally that is total bullshit
According to 3 USC ¬ß2, if electors are left undetermined after a state election, the state government allocates electors. Makes me wonder. Could states with GOP led govts finagle that somehow? Doubtful, but with complicit SCOTUS, I'd say possible. Still, Trump couldn't order it.
Ngl if Biden won trump would run again in 2024 and since Biden is a neolib who will do nothing for people, trump would have no problem winning in a few years time.
Seeing a lot of people blame Trump for the escalating COVID death toll, specifically in reference to the death of Herman Cain. Let's not diminish his role in his own demise. Went to the OK Trump rally&gt; fell ill. All while his team was tweeting right wing bs while on his deathbed.
Ya thats right, Trump is not responsible for corona deaths, CHINA IS!
I ain‚Äôt want the nigga to die but he risked his life for trump. So there‚Äôs that.
Is Fox News going to apologize to any of the families that have lost loved ones due to Covid? Is Trump? All of you have blood on your hands. #TrumpVirus #FoxNews
.... this could produce generational majorities in house, senate, and in state houses around the country (in a redistricting year). Trump doesn't care about those casualties. If he thinks such a ploy offers him a better chance of staying in office he won't hesitate a second.
He didn't ask because he doesn't care. Those troops mean nothing to him.  Trump Says He Did Not Ask Putin About Suspected Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops
"Trump Nomineee Hearing Pulled Amid Furor Over Islam Remarks" by The Associated Press via NYT
Trump suggesting that we change the date of the election should be seen as a threat to our democracy, even if there is no way in hell that it would actually happen.
You should place the blame for tRump where it belongs: Hillary Clinton and the
This is why we have the highest death toll in the world. This is why tens of thousands continue to die needlessly. Trump, Pence and the entire GOP are killing people with their campaign of lies and deceit.  Shame on them. Shame.
Donald Trump ( oh wait this isn't a movie ) just replace any movie clown ü§°
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Reagan was a fascist sympathizer!! Wtf?! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£. Portland, secret police abductions, unilateral increase in drone warfare, tried to ban flag burning, protesting, and insulting the president.... like come on, you are absolutely off your rocker if you think TRUMP isn‚Äôt fascist
Have to insult anyone who doesn't follow your narrative.  Call Senator Scott the Token Blk guy for the Republican party.  Now this.   Vernon Jones: Because I'm a Black Democrat who supports Trump, MSNBC asked me this insulting question
What makes me laugh about this tweet is I know someone is going to read it and assume I‚Äôm a Republican or like Trump.  #SimpleMindedFools
Poor trump
Someone tell Trump that if he delays the election it just rolls back to his predecessor until an election is held. #PresidentObama
‚Å¶ So sit down, bitch.
If this were a Trump 2020 rally, a Back the Blue rally, a Reopen America rally, a Reopen Schools rally, a Please Stop Destroying Our Cities With Your ‚ÄúPeaceful Protests‚Äù rally, a Let‚Äôs Give HCQ a Chance rally.. focus would be on the lack of social distancing &amp; the unmasked. Facts
Hitler cancelled elections then cancelled the legislative body and put himself in charge of the government. Trump could try the same if we look the other way. Dump Trump!
Nah, Trump said he was pulling out last year and just movrd 4000 troops to another section of the Mideast...
If trump can mail in votes then why can't test of the country?  Vote in person fine just don't try to shut down the voting and keep people out oh and how about fix all the districts that Republicans redrew to be in their favor...
Believe it, that is all you are going to get, go vote for Trump 2020 and DRAIN the swamp!
Herman Cain died, I will always think, because he attended the Trump rally in Tulsa several weeks ago.  I always thought he was a good man.  Please, friends, do everything you can to avoid this virus.  No more wasted lives.
To be sure, the service will be better off without trump. The country would be better off without him.  Hell, the entire planet would be better off without him present.
Snopes has spoken...ü§£ü§£
Suicides are up since Trump became POTUS.  I'm sure there are some having issues with this. Too bad, Trump couldn't act sooner...really shut down. We could have nipped this is the bud. Sad.
Trump: it's safe for your kids to go back to school and businesses to open. Also Trump: we need to delay the election I am losing because of the virus. #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpFascist #TrumpVirus
They can‚Äôt answer that question because we haven‚Äôt lost any freedoms.  The left has tried to deprive people of life and liberty if we dare have a different opinion.  We‚Äôve lost friends, families and jobs by stating we support President Trump, law engagement and Al Lives Matter.
Nadler, who thinks Antifa rioting is a myth, despite all the video evidence, now thinks plainclothes police didn‚Äôt exist before Trump. And this is who heads our judiciary committee.
I am sorry he has passed, but in all due respect, he bought into the lie about Covid-19 - that masks don't matter, do whatever Trump tells you, go to a rally with 6,000 people.  He and Trump are responsible for his death.
Wow butt hurt over your documentary now all of a sudden you come out hard against the only candidate whose been outspoken about censorship . You are a piece of work. News flash - Trump didn‚Äôt ban your documentary.
rather or not Herman cain should have went to the trump rally is a question but it doesn't make it funny that he passed away. respect his life and a real person died, you can get COVID anywhere, hopefully you reduce your exposure by doing less risky things
I really hate to even have to comment, but everyone can stop getting all worked up about Trump‚Äôs tweet about moving the election because he LITERALLY cannot do it. Can. Not. This is not complicated.
He attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa micro-rally, where six staffers had Covid. Then he got Covid.
What a stain on the U.S. and Oklahoma response:  It is possible he contracted the virus at the Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
And when Trump wins will yall finally be able to accept its been 4yrs and yall still havent accepted this one then have the nerve to say trump wont accept something whew chile hypocrisy should be the new name of the Democrat party.
Hell trump just cancel the whole election and make yourself president for life.  That‚Äôs what he really meant to say.  96 days boys and girls.  GO BLUE
at home, but I am still encouraging you to speak up and say something to allay our fears. Senator Lankford, we are suffering at home. We are begging for leadership from any side that will take steps to restore the balance, the law and order as Trump so often tweets.
Nothing will stop me from voting trump out of office! #WeWillVote
trump should be thrown out on his ass
The media playing devil's advocate on this is just as dangerous as what Trump is saying. It's shameful to even consider this behavior.
Trump suggests delaying 2020 election
Thanks Trump .
I really wish Donald Trump would resign! #TrumpResignNow
What are your thoughts?  Should the 2020 US Presidential Election be delayed, as President Trump suggested in a tweet Thursday morning?  Read more on what the President had to say:
Yet you have let Donald trump disparage and fire people who were whistleblowers
There is the distinct possibility that millions of people may actually vote for Biden. Trump wants this nipped in the bud now.
I remember when Trump was 1 of 17 vying for the Republican nomination. He said (not verbatim) when he wins the nomination he would expose the GOP for the filth they are. He indeed did just that #gop
Herman Cain survived stage 4 colon cancer, and as a result had a comprised immune system as do most cancer survivors who undergo treatment. But yeah let's blame Trump.
Just 1 more. Donald Trump
You aren‚Äôt fooling us, trump butt-kisser.  Take the pork out and help the people!!
Great, short thread. Trump indeed has crossed the Rubicon this morning.
This is your daily reminder that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 2,865,075 votes. #25th #Corrupt #TrumpShutdown #Unstable

Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election.  Need to accept the idea, that the mail in ballot is a bad deal for the good guys.
Too bad so many  listened to Trump instead of the scientific and expert medical professionals. RIP.
So what you mean to tell me is that Hermain Cain just died this morning after likely contracting covid at Trump's rally here in Tulsa, OK, and his twitter account is tweeting about covid skepticism and blaming the media and CDC for people's nonadhererance to social distancing?
I just want to know how Trump kept Alyssa Milano from shaving her legs for 4 months. That‚Äôs the only thing keeping me on this hell site today
Donald Trump isn't a man, he is one million cockroaches in a human shaped skin bag
Batshit crazy, just like Trump.
He died because of ignorance and stupidity.  AKA....Trump.
That‚Äôs what they want then the media can lie to the sheep and say it was peaceful and they rolled tanks in for no reason. It‚Äôs all Trump they were just sitting in the park with candles planning how to deliver food to old people the next day and here comes Trumps tanks!
Has Donald Trump ever watched an entire documentary?
is this Trump campaign footage? they try to make 200 people appear to be 2000.
Trump will never be impeached by the senate while Republicans hold power. He‚Äôs proven that already. I don‚Äôt see a peaceful transition if he loses.
We have to fight this new party of Trump.. It has killed our oilfield and economy and now, COVID19 will kill many because he won‚Äôt mandate masks and follow the CDC guidelines.
Trump asked a question and everyone behaves like he just dropped atomic bombs in the Heartlands. It's rather comical.

Because trump just farted
A few seats to the right of Mr. Cain (outside of this photo) sat Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who also contracted the virus.  It was Stitt, a trump-puppet, who thought it was a grand idea to hold an indoor rally in the midst of a pandemic.
Donald Trump murdered Herman Cain.
It‚Äôs an ultra corrupt deal. There‚Äôs no doubt Trump and his minions fingerprints are all over this.
So, once a hoax kills an important a Trump sycophant‚Äîall of a sudden it is time to do the right things to combat this virus.   You are incapable of leading. You should resign from public service as you have only been serving your own greed and power driven ends. Shame on you!
Trump's doc on Trump's state TV essentially saying ignore anything Trump has to say about the virus. Wow.
making sure trump knows our democracy will not be deterred or delayed #WeWillVote
Vote tomorrow to get trump gone
7. the donald is the charismatic figure with visual and verbal identification with the American fascist base: he's embarrassingly tacky, uneducated and pretty stupid, like them. They love him. The puppet masters have to do something.   trump decides nothing. He is just a thing.

I totally agree with Pete‚Äôs first statement.... the second statement I‚Äôm not quite convinced...   I‚Äôm leaning toward voting third party right now, but I‚Äôve entertained the idea of Biden because his tone is considerable better than Trump‚Äôs.
A 74-year-old died from COVID? This is unheard of. It must be because he‚Äôs a Trump supporter. I thought we were all supposed to live to be 300. What‚Äôs happening?

Sure hope intelligence is watching Russia for voter interference in favor of Trump as he and Putin have become bff.  We know Trump expects something in return to benefit him.  Heads up!!
No way to know when and where he contracted COVID, but Herman Cain tested positive days after attending President Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa.

Yet the GOP keep drinking the Trump Fool Aid #gop
Yes, Trump must see his contribution to this death.
GOOD LORD! TRUMP CANNOT DELAY THE ELECTION!!
I will show up in person and wait in line if necessary to insure my vote for Joe. Biden is not hijacked by the Trump administration.
You are correct! Trump bears some blame. He still doesn‚Äôt respect the virus.
Tulsa.  He got it at Trump‚Äôs rally
Tragic news. Herman Cain was among those who attended Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally. He was hospitalized 12 days later. He was photographed not wearing a mask and said the media was overhyping COVID-19 a few days earlier
Herman Cain has died after being hospitalized with COVID-19.   Cain attended President Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa in June 20th.
Can we all say Tulsa? Because Trump‚Äôs event in Tulsa is highly likely the place where he contracted the virus. If I were in Cain‚Äôs family, I would make sure Trump saw his part in killing him.
This is why Trump had everyone sign waivers for his Tulsa rally. Our governor  also tested positive after the rally.
This globalist, front man has one job: keep the fear going and downplay effective therapeutics until and his pals can make billions on a dangerous vaccine (and hopefully oust Trump in the bargain).
Wow! So hoaxes can be deadly? Who knew? Can trump be forced to comment? A lot of other political undesirables were with him in Tulsa, not wearing masks. This could really complicate rigging the election.
Don't let Trump's calls to delay the election (which he doesn't have the power to do, it requires both houses of congress) distract you from what he wants you to forget:
trump's ill-conceived Tulsa rally, in the middle of a pandemic, caused the death of former GOP Presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  There is no telling how many people were infected that evening and the coliseum was only 1/3 full.
Well.... I hope the Tulsa Trump rally was worth it.
I thought with Martial Law the election could be delayed.  Maybe this is Trump‚Äôs way of getting the Dems to stop the riots in their cities.  If they don‚Äôt, then martial law will be declared.  Everyone knows Trump will win 2020.  If Hillary couldn‚Äôt beat him Brainless Biden can‚Äôt
Folks.. please read before making any kind of comment.
11.2 million of us, at minimum, will need to rise up if trump refuses to leave. That is the 3.2%of the population historically needed to evict an autocrat. Be ready.
Thank you. He‚Äôs had many years of suffering, but he loves America &amp; Donald Trump.
Oh my god absentee voting and mail in ballots would work the same way, but Trump thinks one is better than the other? I can‚Äôt with y‚Äôall‚Äôs President
So, thoughts on your boy Trump wanting to postpone the election?
Interesting that trump is trying to force schools to repopen but would like to delay the election to keep everyone ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù He‚Äôs not even trying to be transparent. It‚Äôs weak, ‚Äúdear leader‚Äù shit from man who knows his days in office are numbered.
I think what bothers me most about this is not his inane tweet (which aren't we all used to by now?), but the media's immediate OMG BREAKING NEWS STORY that gets everyone all riled up. p.s. - He can't change the date.
‚ÄúPresident‚Äù Trump is also a lunatic, so we have to take that into consideration.
This is the headline story today, not Trump's distraction tweet.
Trump really said we should delay the 2020 election. This man is a fucking disgrace to the office and a disgrace for America.
I don't understand Trump's motivation. As a praise junkie, being an ex-president is right up his alley. People love W. People adore Carter. People had very kind things to say about Nixon in the early 90's. Ex-president sounds like his dream gig.
America was great until Trump came in.
A hot take: The Presidency is supposed to represent the best of us. If this is the best the Boomers can do - Trump and Biden - then maybe we should phase Boomers out more quickly. At the very least, they need to take responsibility for it and quit blaming Millennials.
We always knew Trump had authoritarian instincts, even before he was elected.
Says ONE of trump‚Äôs measly 33% of cult followers!! He will never be re-elected but cheer up maybe you can visit him in prison!! Cult followers geez üôÑ
Reason to believe?? My GOD!! The alternative is TRUMP! There‚Äôs your reason!
Ok...dude...that is exactly what could be said for Biden. Using your very own logic that is exactly what you Trumpers are doing to Biden. Trump admits to it, he is accusing himself. Not to mention Biden never put a full page out saying some innocent kids need the death penalty.
No. No. No. NO. NO. NO!!!!!!!  Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
Trump virus killing our pets.
Even if an election is delayed (absolutely should not be), Trump wouldn‚Äôt be in office after his term is up. Right? Which leads me to believe his newest campaign to delay it means he doesn‚Äôt know that.
I feel the timeline diverged when the UK voted for Brexit and we've been living in an alternate timeline where Trump became President ever since.
Trump raises idea of delaying election
He git paid off by Trump and Kemp for sure
Im feeling a lot of eagerness to vote this year. I predict high vote turnout. I also predict, no matter what Trump is going to claim voter fraud and fight this tooth and nail. I really think he's trying to start a war.
Trump is terrified of losing to Sleepy Joe Biden! üòÇ
Only Congress can delay it and if they delay it beyond February then Trump is removed from office.   If the rules still matter.
How am I supposed to love thy neighbor when thy neighbor's WiFi is unironically named "TRUMP MAGA"
Trump is getting ready for the massive rebellion
Before you ponder all the terrifying reasons Trump would tweet about delaying the election (something he cannot do and absolutely will not happen), might I point out this piece of news that he undoubtedly wants to distract us from.
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Trump 2020
If you wish to take Hydrochoriquine  why cant you Why is the left dead set against it  Was Trump right and that's what the  dems are pissed about Or OUR  great leaders Stand to make money off of covid vaccine  Why didnt restaurants wipe menu off during flu season COVID IS MONEY
President Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud
I have found much of what Trump has said and tweeted scary, but this is fucking terrifying. He has just suggested we not have an election. The march to an authoritarian dictatorship has become a sprint. Every American of conscious has to reject this abomination.
Headlines and push alerts should also make clear Trump doesn‚Äôt have the power to do this. Pretty easy to write ‚Äúa decision that would be up to Congress‚Äù
Posted in April: President Donald Trump said on Monday that he has no intention of trying to win re-election by using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to delay the presidential vote in the United States scheduled for November 3.
Sadly, if you aren‚Äôt voting for Trump, you may have to go in-person to vote, just to help not give him any excuses. Beyond frustrating. Thanks for speaking up and giving us honest information. #RidinWithBiden
. is floating his conspiracy theory on election fraud for mail in votes. This crazed lunatic is setting the stage for another civil war. America we must make Biden win by landslide so there is no chance in hell trump will remain in power. VOTE üíôüá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíôüá∫üá∏üíô
Sadly quite a few people like Trump, this is why everyone who doesn't needs to vote
Because trump isn't a racist and has nothing to atone for except maybe his own sin to Jesus
After covering Trump for 5 years, how can you not see that he isn‚Äôt being serious? I‚Äôm not saying I approve of how the president uses twitter, but clearly he tries to joke around sometimes and mess with the media. And once again, you have fallen into his trap.
Hmmm....so he proves yet again he despises are system of government and and a US constitution. #TraitorTrump  Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so  via
Yep. It's been predicted he'll do exactly this for some time.
Why am I being blocked from adding 2 followers every 4 days. Begged you to stop this. Is this happening to anyone else? I'm sick of it. Prez adds followers everyday but we can't? Something's not right. Rules should apply to all. Trump spreads Fake News esp VOTING
The Dems have no power. The house has literally given trump everything he asks for. There is no opposition.
Bullshit... Trump is trying to steal democracy from Americans... NO
No wonder Trump wants to divert attention to whether he will try to delay the November election.
I‚Äôm not sure why anybody would be surprised by Trump floating this idea by the way. It is truly the most obvious possible turn of events
Trump suggests delaying the U.S. presidential election
You can‚Äôt be serious...just look at my past tweets. I have busted literally dozens of foreigners tweeting misinformation, in defense of Trump. Trump literally asked foreign help to win the election.
In my Trump District stores begging for change as it is. It's going to get worse again if no cash too. Sure it's coming though
Democrats always take the exact opposite position of Trump.  Dems will now say voting is safe and much occur.
Liberals:  All of Europe is superior to the US. Trump: Open schools. Liberals: Not safe, irresponsible, dangerous!  Trump: All of Europe opened their schools. Liberals: crickets.   #BLEXIT #KAG #KAGA2020 #MAGA #WalkAwayFromDemocrats #JoeBidenIsARacist #WalkAway
And here we go... Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Translation: Trump is scared he's going to lose to Biden so wants to delay the election so he can cling to power.
And what about Trump? I could literally show you hundreds of excerpts of him showing signs of dementia but you guys ignore that and bring up Biden Biden Biden. Like wow. The projecting is strong with y‚Äôall.
Wow...you Trumpers staying on topic is a chore in itself. Went from having dementia to sexual abuse. And the irony is that Trump has literally decades of sexual abuse complaints that y‚Äôall ignore...weird.
And whats with Trump? For sake of the argument suppose you are right...what‚Äôs up with Trumps word salads? Trump not being able to pronounce words? Like you do see that, or are you not wanting to?
Here we go folks - dictator trump
The fact Trump's family wealth was made from his father defrauding the federal government while building low-income housing, and he turns around to do this, tells you everything you need to know about this family.

doesn't get it again she wouldn't give Mary Trump any credit because she isn't close with the younger cousins Ivanka and others BUT THE BOOK IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE FOUNDATION OF HIM AS A PERSON!! NOT THE ENTIRE FAMILY...
How is Trump the dumbass here?? The guy in the blue suit on the right is the dumbass and shouldn't have been crossing his arms. Trump was just watching the shit show. In this chain of handshakes, it alternates from arms crossed to not crossed then crossed then not crossed etc.
You only dont care when it is a Trump supporter!  Hypocrites!
Remember this hashtag #NobodyLikesTrump when Trump wins again &amp; makes Liberals cry again!  CAN'T WAIT!
It's called a pandemic.  Trump said  himself, " Iam a war time president "
Shit. I hope this doesn't mean a war.....   Trump 2024!
Nope, trump said that everyone is jealous of our testing! We have the best tests ever...ü§£ he's such a dipshit.
Yes, Leader. Since Trump has no clue WTF he is doing, she is now the leader of the ACTUAL free world. You need to read something not from Fox, written by a fox commentator, or Republican. Seriously. Be well rounded in your information.

if trump and his enablers were actively trying to sabotage and undermine america, what would they be doing differently? anything?
Trump will never come close to what Cuomo did when he forced sick infectious patients back into nursing homes.

According to the  story I linked to, the LP is dumping a inordinately large % of it‚Äôs money in paying its operators and consultants. Much more than most PACs. And their biggest ad buys are in DC, likely targeted directly at Trump; not voters in swing states.
The actual electoral benefits remain to be seen but the fact is this is largely run by old guard republicans paying themselves big $$$. They helped pave the way for Trump but have since been exiled from their own party by Trump.

Will somebody ask Trump if he's had ANY COVID-19 treatments or tests other than his claim of 14 day script of hydroychloquine.  Blood, plasma, EKG, Lung Function, swabs, saliva, urine?  Ask if he is a blood donor - what type?

Well if you can't be an enemy of Don Trump's state then you aren't a true patriot.

To be completely fair to Donald Trump, it‚Äôs not so much HIM that I dislike, it‚Äôs that I won‚Äôt give assh*les, that mock handicapped people, a single ounce of grace, because that kind of assh*le has no grace.
Because they really, really don't want Trump to be right about hydroxychloroquine.  Even if it could have saved lives. It is only really controversial in western countries.

I‚Äôve always voted republican I even voted for Donald trump reluctantly in 2016. I was undecided all the way to walking in the ballot box.  In 2020 for the first time in my life I will vote for a democrat for president and every other federal office. Classical conservatives
What are we going to do just lay down &amp; let this country go bankrupt. I guess if it means getting Trump out of office the libs will do anything to include destroying this country. Go back to work, go back to school. See as  had on his profile  one time, we believers
To them.  What trump is doing with the federal officers is big time government overreach and republicans are completely quiet while they try to hammer on China for civil rights violations but don‚Äôt worry about trumps violations.
They have compromised on their values , they have compromised conservatism. They are no longer fiscal conservatives. If they were they would have said No to trump tax policy. Then there‚Äôs the whole Russia issue. Republicans have cowered to trump. Russia interfering don‚Äôt matter

Yep. The hypocrisy is inexcusable. Especially when you look at the character of Barack Obama (not his policies) and see how he was treated by the ‚Äúreligious right.‚Äù They literally had to create fantasies to disparage him. And now they create fantasies to excuse Trump.
Trump prolly fancies himself a pack of Reese‚Äôs Pieces cuz much like him they‚Äôre mostly orange and in pieces iunno thank u
Biden isn't scary so the right is trying to tie him to rose twitter and the squad basically. It's dumb, but then Trump doesn't have much respect for his base.  And frankly they don't warrant much respect.
üî•üî• MSM is a complete joke in this country..üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏  Thats right, Trump doesnt have a filter and hes a dick but his policies are great. He's done a lot and people are blinded by hate..
the lincoln project is only targeting staunch trump supporters like...  *checks notes*  ...susan collins
If you support Biden and think he is different than Trump you are in a cult.
there are people globally who read the fake tweet sent out by trump. This is hurting other nations. He should be reigned in.  There is no cure except in trumps delusions  Silence is Complicity
The company dictionary for the CNN goons probably shows the following entry under ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù: The word for a Trump claim that turns out to be true, or possibly so, or at least reasonably supportable, and which requires CNN to clean the egg and rabies froth off our faces.
Trump is also a creepy old radical.
So you‚Äôre going to help remove trump from office? If not shut up
Trump urinal cakes!
Says ONE of trump‚Äôs measly 33% of cult followers! Baffles me that people CLAIMING TO BE CHRISTIAN can support a guy that assaulted 25 women and raped a 13 year old child (court papers are online)? He will never be re-elected but cheer up maybe you can visit him in prison!
‚ÄòThe swamp is alive and well in Washington, D.C.‚Äô ‚Äî 40 lobbyists with ties to Trump got $10 billion of federal coronavirus aid for their clients
I'm waiting for the Trump take on "shooting shrimp shells up your nose."
Great example of how everything could have been a little better if the Senate would have removed Trump from office and we could have been dealing with Pence instead. I still don't like Pence's political or religious ideology, but at least he's mentally fit for office.
This is your daily reminder that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 2,865,075 votes. #25th #Corrupt #TrumpShutdown #Unstable

From  Gen. Mattis says:  "We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‚Äòbattlespace.'" He says Trump makes "a mockery of our Constitution" and 6,000 vets in the ad agree.
The fact that Trump endorsed this (retweeted) this without investigation should show people how legitimate his claims about hydroxycloroquine are...
Someone ask Trump, in about 2 weeks, if he can remember Person. Man. Woman. Camera. TV.   Say it and say ‚Äúdo you remember these things?‚Äù    He won‚Äôt know what the fuck you are talking about.
So, within a few hours after talking with Putin, Trump pulls over 11,000 U.S. troops out of Germany. Now tell me again how the current occupant of the White House isn't under the thumb of Russia.
That is an absolute lie propagated by Trump!
That is an absolute lie propagated by Trump!
Women for trump vote red
I‚Äôm actually noting voting for tRump so that‚Äôs a vote for Biden.
Have to wonder how many of the people in these comments defending Trump would have cheered these same moves if Obama had done them.  In any case, Putin is a critical threat to the sovereignty of Europe. Trump is a patsy.
Yes! Vote out these people! Trump, Pence, Barr, Kellyanne Conjob, Mnuchin, Miller, etc. vote ‚Äòem and disinfect the White House
Bernie endorsed Hillary and Joe. I‚Äôm fine with a second tRump term. Will you be okay too?
Can this election just be over now? I'm sick to death of hearing about Trump this and Biden that. November can't get here fast enough.
Based on the media and the spin out of Washington, D.C. opposing Trump, I'd hate to see what a real soft coup and attempted treason looks like!  If the Democrats win in November the Republic party and anyone showing opposition will be steamrolled both politically and socially.
It‚Äôs escalating bc of the police now.  The more they do this crap hoping to squash the protesting the more people will protest.  Trump thinks violence is the answer but it‚Äôs only making things worse.
You definitely care about my opinion as you seek to influence it. Have children and be responsible for them. I‚Äôll outlive all of tRump‚Äôs judicial appointments. Hope you do too!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
...and you see ‚ÄúDemon Sperm‚Äù trending on Twitter a decade later and wonder if they finally hit it big, but no, 2020 and president Trump are just that weird
You notice √âric growing a Trump Jr type beard &amp; combing his hair like his bro? Hoping it‚Äôll help him get noticed.
"You are pleased."  That's nice. I'm pleased to share that I sold all of my 28,000 shares in your company yesterday and today after you again showed more interest in Tweeting than informing investors substantively. You have become the Trump of biotech Tweeters. Congrats.
What part of "illegal" doesn't Donald Trump understand?
I have never seen a worse bunch of idiots and liars as the correct group of democrat leaders.  They create disruption and blame Trump, but won‚Äôt let him solve the problem.  They lie about every thing Trump.  Biden is not qualified to be POTUS , but they support him at your risk.
The left never want to hear the truth. Anytime someone tries to cut someone off from speaking that means they‚Äôre afraid that their lies will be exposed.  Vote Trump 2020 #maga2020
Pres. Trump says he is looking at BANNING TikTok.
I‚Äôm voting for President Trump no matter what!   KEEP IT GOING!
Any evidence to support your assertion that they were ‚Äúprobably Feds sent by Trump‚Äù or are you just trying to get people worked up? And why does it matter if she‚Äôs transgender? Transgender people break the law &amp; get arrested too. Were you not aware?
I can‚Äôt make up the crazy crap that the media throws out everyday. If trump  doesn‚Äôt get re-elected they will have nothing to talk about??

You know in Mean Girls how Gretchen kept trying to make "fetch" a fad? I feel like HCQ is Trump's "fetch" that he keeps trying to make into fad
Do you think Trump will be charged and prosecuted for his crimes once he leaves office?
You don't talk about Russian bounties on US troops or trump's love of Putin. You don't talk about the 150,000+ dead Americans because of GOP incompetence. Or the fact that trump is promoting doctors that believe in demon sperm. Dead troops, Dead Americans and you're Dead Silent
Donald Trump is a lying POS and he is right, no one likes him.
.  get your ass moving and pass this next stimulus bill minus the gifts to the Trump family, please!!!!!
I know a way around tRump‚Äôs demand that classes have to open in person - do what tRump does - simply ‚Äúredefine‚Äù what it means what it means for classes to be ‚Äúopen‚Äù - he‚Äôs way too stupid to figure it out
good morning. fuck tRump

The tragedy is this was from a FB post of Oklahoma family/friends! It hardly matters anymore when we were cut-off in 2015 when to their shock &amp; dismay they discovered we weren‚Äôt voting for Trump. Same old story for all of America. Still love them.
Jfc...you literally took sound bites like from Biden in regards to past statements AT THE SAME TIME ignore what Trump has said...done? Glass houses motherfucker....glass houses.
‚ÄúHe‚Äòs got this high approval rating. Why don‚Äòt I have a high approval rating with respect ‚Äî and the administration ‚Äî with respect to the virus?‚Äù Trump asked, painting Fauci simultaneously as both expendable and an important teammate. #Oklahoma #covid19
Because trump is probably paying for kanyes campaign to help him steal another election
To help his friend trump win. Thats the point of his campaign to try and steal some of the young people or black vote which takes votes away from biden and then kanyes buddy trump wins again
The CDC WHO Fauci knew China was playing in with a virus Fauci told Trump in 2017 that he would face a pandemic  HOW DID HE KNOW THAT ? This virus has Politics smell all over it How is it that you die in a car wreck and it is written down covid death People still die of non covid
The Democrats would accuse him of putting doctors out of work if he found a cure for cancer. They simply hate Trump and Republicans and care less about facts, only their agenda.
This is a scam devised by Kanye and his buddy Donald Trump. They know a 3rd party candidate takes votes away from the democratic candidate and allows Republicans to win. Republicans will vote staright ticket the plan is to split the Democrat vote to help trump
When you feel so mad that you want to roar, take a deep breath, and count to 4....thousand and infinity cuz trump is so god damn infuriating.  is the best programming ever üòä we love
I do not believe that the I voters want them to be offensive rude in large numbers,  The squeaky wheels maybe but not most. The representatives are they themselves the culprit as their power and influence can only continue by the destruction of Trump and his supporters
Think the issue is more with running government like a *Trump* business (e.g., corrupt, incompetent, unaccountable, and likely to end in bankruptcy).
Trump is so incompetent.
I never believed the ‚Äúsucker born every minute‚Äù quote until Trump.

"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Comes Full Circle on His Convention" by Unknown Author via NYT
Trump, whether you like him or hate him, was a middle finger to the establishment from the people. The saddest part is that there were barely enough people left in the country to give that bird!
So seriously, anyone wanna move to Canada or Scotland with me if Trump gets re-elected?
I think Trump's opposition to mass mail-in might be a tiger trap.
On election night, there will be some precincts reporting.  Those precincts are going to skew hard right.  The media narrative will be a Trump landslide while all the pundits repeat, "But we have to wait for the mail-in count," about once every three minutes. Everybody's crying.
Is Trump likely to win in a landslide or will it be a squeaker?
It‚Äôs gonna blow my mind when I see my kid bring home a history book from school that contains a section about trump and photos of the stupid shit he says on TwitterTrumps term ends Jan. 20,2021. If no POTUS elected  the Speaker of the House becomes POTUS. It's  in the Constitution.  So Trump can play his games but in the end he will leave the White House  "One Way or Another".   Always like that song.
Perhaps one of these? I know this is the source of trump‚Äôs anger towards the Chinese. üôÄüôÄüòπüòπ
Here‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to see if trump doesn‚Äôt vacate the White House. üôÄüòπ

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Herman Cain. After attending the  Trump rally in Tulsa, he contracted the coronavirus. He was one of the leading African-Americans in The republican party.
Malpractice and Trumps cronies should all be charged with negligent homicide! Trump knew full well what hecwas dealing with in October of 2019.
Listen to your elders. When asked in May 2016 what she thought about Trump as POTUS Her reply, "Trump! Trumps another Mussolini"!  Grandma 85 years old.
We need a president who will appoint a special prosecutor to provide truth and reconciliation following trump‚Äôs reign of terror and treason! I am voting for you and every democratic candidate on the ballot but I want trump in Guantanamo Bay before he expires from natural causes.
Trump removing 12 000 troops from Germany a wake up call who Trump really works for. Sure isnt for freedom loving people.
That‚Äôs it! I knew the republicans refused to shut down Guantanamo Bay for a reason. The trump presidential library has a home!üôÄüòπ

As far as I'm concerned they all violated thier oath to the US Constitution.  Making the American people Trumps enemies in his orders  protecting &amp; knowingly Trump colluded with Putin &amp; Russians to steal election is treason.
COVID-19 took the same path out of China like the Black Plague that killed est 75-200 million. Mutated into a pneumonic plague spread human to human via aerosols. Trump was informed &amp; ignored warnings from CDC due to his insanity of racism &amp; should be charged with manslaughter

Hire Americans doesn‚Äôt apply to trump or his supporters. Republicans are still the largest employers of undocumented workers in the United States. They don‚Äôt want to stop illegal immigration, they want to drive it deeper underground and lower wages for undocumented workers.

Thom Hartmann an hour ago. A lady 5 ft tall 100lbs sexually assaulted by one of Trumps Storm Troops last night in the Federal Building in Portland. He had no name tag, no Badge number, never read her Rights when taken into custody. We now live in a Trump Fascist Police State.
Disgustingly horrid ! These thugs were sent into the streets by Donald Trump . Abuse of power by the chronic abuser of all Americans .Men , women and children . Misogynist turned dictator . He must be held accountable for what he has done .
Trump Sure has his Nazis propaganda memorized.
Laws mean nothing to tyrants . That will be thier duenas fall. Frankly  this was 1950 everything from bountys, COVID-19, Russians  , lies, graft Trump and Barr be fryin iin an electric chair. Oh yes read pages 116-117 not the 1st time Barr saved tyrants from prison.
Stupid is that stupid does. I always felt he fried his brains drinking Texas fracking water. I thought he was supposed to meet Trump in Texas today.
That's what the Democrats R trying 2 do; keep Republican candidates away and have a whole lot of democratic candidates. That's how we got Trump because the quote" quotes other ones was siding with the Democrats because of fear of them and the media. Trump turned out 2 B better.
FYI  Marine and Army Vets here all retired at Ft Sill  was calling Trump a traitor the day after the election.
In the 1950s Trump would have been sent to the electric chair.
My Trump has more common sense
Anybody notice Trump limping and favoring his right leg?
Well that's a no brainer. Trump been buddy's with Putin and KGB since 1987.
I know a bunch of retired Marines and ARMY Vets here at Ft Sill that hates Trump since the day it was made public he dodged the draft.
I like my Trump Never mouths off or try steal my money
You can bet the Trump family and thier cronies has investments  in the company that manufacture of this drug.

Trump is to American Presidents                    what The Vega was to GM automobiles
Trump steals election he will be the most Powerful man in Washington. Barr have all Trump opponents arrested.The plan in 1933, 5 regions with appointed governors &amp; Senators, abolish Congress, free press abolished,  VP abolished, Chief of Staff taking orders from industrialist
In reality plan all ready in effect. Trump just a figure head. A consortium of industrialist making policy, Chief of Staff carry out thier objectives.
He want resign. Barr just part of the plan after Trump steals the election. Barr will have Trump opponents arrested, dissolve Congress, all US Senators appointed, US divided into 5 regions each an appointed governor, no free press, VP abolished replaced with a Chief of Staff.
your ignorant, I used to like the view till y'all got Trump Derangement Syndrome. I was a Democrat and changed two years ago because of people from the left lost their minds with TDS....
Funny. Women scare the crap out if all these Republicans. My Mother called Trump a Mussolini at a town hall.
Two nurses at Oklahoma City hospital's stated 2 people died Sunday from COVID-19 . The state reported no deaths Sunday. Governor Stitt , Trump's lap dog hiding the true figures.
Two nurses at a OKC hospital stated two died from COVID-19  Sunday while the state stated no deaths reported in Oklahoma. Governor Stitt, Trump laps dog been hiding true figures from day one.
I get more info from this Trump than the Trump in the White House.
Barr knows full well if Trump loses the election a set of Bob Barkers will have his name on it.
I don't think Trump has made the best choices with the virus,but still he's a great president compared to Obama,Bush, and Clinton. It may not be now,but I bet the economy will be at it's best under trump admin.
This borders on attempted manslaughter. Guarantee if a doctor had done the same he would be in jail. Frankly Trumps actions or non actions from the day the 1st case of COVID-19  hit our shores. Trump should be charged with Genocide.
üòÇüòÇüòÇI keep getting spam emails from trump asking for donations
Trump and Republican denial, lies and mishandling this Pandemic  Borders on attempted manslaughter or Genocide.
I swear, if Trump or any influential supporter of his came out publicly &amp; said a good diet &amp; sufficient exercise is the best way to live long and healthy that these lefties would swarm McDonalds and Burger King, super size everything &amp; drink soda by the 3 liter watching TV 24/7!
Trump better thank God this isn't 1955. His relationship with Putin, asking the Russians to get involved in our elections,  Republicans accepting Russian money funnelled thru the NRA. I have a feeling people would be  going to prison or DOJ warming up electric chairs.
That's part I like about Trump. He's  predictable.
Trump has brought shame to our Democracy and doesnt give a rats petute!
If Trump steals the election and this is America's future. I betting there will be another Civil War. No pardons this time! .
I don't have a PhD doesn't take rickets science how Trump plan to refuse the election.  The militias &amp; riots in the streets, all spelled out in this book written decades ago. Only reason it failed in 1933 no boots in the ground.
Oh he would. Blowing up the Drmocratoc HQ in Arizona isn't an assault on our Democracy. I predicted Barr and Trump would have mercenaries  and paid rioters on the street last year. Just using Hitlers play book.
I'm preparing for the worse. Looking at the 1867 Hayes election Trump and GOP will pull some dirty tricks.
Please send donations ASAP so these fine people can help beat Trump. There're  getting scared to pull this stunt.
Considering the only companies I ever heard of trump forming was to pay off his NDAs like Stormy Daniels. I suspect they could be considered successful in their intended purpose but they didn‚Äôt employ people or produce anything. üôÄüòπ
Sounds little funny. Guess she believes Trump going to win the election. Mite want to put a reservation in for a U Haul truck just in case.
National Security Adviser? Shouldn‚Äôt part of his job be risk management? You know identity &amp; evaluate threats, then put controls to mitigate the risks. I doubt he‚Äôll infect trump since the idiot can‚Äôt be bothered w/ National Security. #TrumpVirus2020

No his ego will  go fight ut.  Trump gambling he can pull off a Coup D'etat  so he can sit next to his dictator friends and brag. Look what I did.
Is folded hands around Trump  a security thing??
No your not a cannibal, quoting the regressives favorite saying, Your just stupid.Trump has led the march to burn peoples own neighborhoods, their grocery stores in their neighborhoods, riot, loot  and destroy property.  He is so bad. Just be sure to wash your hands in the fight
When  Christians/believers Stop being ‚ÄúCOMPLICIT‚Äù with Trump / White House and the enemies of God, He will hear our prayers.
Been saying for months. Trump has two options.  A bugout plan or excuse to declare martial law cancelling elections and make himself POTUS for life. The latter was planned in 1933.
Because Netanyahu is a corrupt bigoted nationalist like trump?üôÄüòπ
They sure got thier Nazi propaganda down pat. Heck  Trump supporters wear mask with Swasikas on the front of  them in Minnesota's.
I'm sure they would do the same in 1933 Germany. Trump is thier saviour from the bad old Liberals want "Free Stuff" like SSI &amp; Medicare , caravans of Hispanics taking thier jobs and an African American family moving in next door.
Warning! Alot of profanity in this message but George Carlin was right. But then again Trump can get away with cussing.   George Carlin called it. What he's saying no politicians will ever admit.
Well put in Okie terms. There'res not a dictator out there today or in the past  like Hitler, Bizmark, Stalin, Mussolini, Franco , that didn't have a few loose screws. With Trump its beyond loose screws.
Or at trump university üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My health is MY HEALTH. The government should not be able to trump that. ( no I don‚Äôt mean the president )
What we are witnessing the biggest land grab since 1929. 28 million evicted from homes &amp; apts, landlords loosing property, small business &amp; farmers as well. Trump stated 1995 he made when people lose homes Steve Mnuchin, Wells Fargo stolen 1,000s of homes never went to prison
Proud To Be An American‚Äî‚Äîbecause it was my late father‚Äôs favorite song. And I reeeallly hate that Trump plays it!
And convienantly you‚Äôre a political activist.  I tested 32 patients for Covid in the last two weeks and all of them are negative.  So I assumed Trump is responsible for them being healthy too?  Sticky to being a lawyer and leave pandemics to Epidemiologist.

Pronouns suck but X √Ü A-12 is fine? Bad call, edgebot. Keep red pilling everyone and just support Trump we all know you want to.
I can't wait until they put Donald Trump on trial after they kick him out of the White House !
History will not judge Trump and his enablers kindly !
I've been doing my damn best to try and do that since Trump Day 1 !
Yes an no, at the start of the year we had almost all our stuff being built there, but therona forced us to start moving manufacturing back here. Technically, Trump could snap his finger an start forcing companies to make supplies here, as he can do it using therona as his excuse
What people in Washington  call Capitalism in reality Fascism. True Capitalism Trickle Down works, but in the case of the Trump Republicans they have a dirty little secret. Prisons, slavery, police and thats called Fascism.
Hey it's ok. Had the same happen 2 years ago a lady  I really cared for. Time heals. Believe me when the arrest warrants start flying they will change thier tune. Oh yes. Mom would be proud. She stated Trump was another  Mussolini May 2016.
Stupid. They out numbered before they get out of bed to beat up people. Somebody should inform Trump Vets are replacing the Moms. Real soldiers  combat hardened that know what the Constitution reads instead if these punks. Heck even General Honore' stayes Trumps troops BS!
Trump is proof we should listen to our elders. My Mother 85 years old stated in May 2016. "Trumps another Mussolini". Mom should know she survived WWII, Hitler and Mussolini Fascism.
Hope this never broadcasted. FOX is bad enough at reaching Trump propaganda.
General Honore' supports these Vets. The General angry at Trump and these cops wearing US Military uniforms and making War in the American people expressing thier 1st Amendment rights.
General Honore' ticked off at Trump &amp; these clowns making War on the American people expressing thier 1st Amendment Rights. ARMY &amp; MARINE Vets here at Ft Sill were ticked of the day after the election Trump put in the White House even thought 3 million more voted for Clinton.
Ever get the feeling Trump trying to kill us off doing Putin a favor?
General Honore' stated it best yesterday. Bunch of ticked off Vets in my home town. They saw thru Trump long before he stole the election.
Not just trump! üôÄüôÄüòæüòæ
I will never forget the day after the Electoral College handed Trump the White House. Working a a big box lumber in the tool dept.  just outside  Ft Sill, Oklahoma. All day long Vets &amp; retired Vets here from the US Army &amp; Marine Corps. Anger!!! Even calling Trump a Fascist.
Trump, Speaks, Its, Horse, Crap

If that‚Äôs what I think it is, I love it! Can you imagine using that phrase for treason ? Just another reason to send the entire trump family to GITMO. üôÄüòπ

Trump as incompetent as Hoover and has the evil of Adolf Hitler.
I think Alaska has a few thousand acres to spare.  It not like trump gives a shit. üôÄüôÄüòæüòæ
Trump is opposed to supporting public schools that do reopen! That‚Äôs why he put Betsy DeVos in place at the Department of Education. We are 45% dummer by having trump as president. DeVos‚Äô job is to bring it up another 15 percentage points before leaving office.üôÄüôÄüòπüòπ
This is a practice run for November, December and January  after Trump refuses to leave office.
Trump would say that. Only been a friend of the Russians since 1987.
In a formerly classified FBI document released at the GOP's behest, Trump‚Äôs comments about Russia reveal him to be either incredibly gullible and unsophisticated in his understanding, or deliberately disingenuous about Russia.  via
Quit acting like an idiot trump supporter and start acting like a responsible member of good governance. How did you get to your position anyway?
Now I see why the reactions day after Trump stole the election. Retired ARMY and USMC vets here at Ft Sill ticked off. One stated, I'm cleaning, locking and loading. I asked why. He stated Trump's a Fascist we will be in a Civil War  within a few years.
Bernie it's time you go retire and let trump fix America
Trump calling out his federal police  in Seattle and  Chicago just  practice run for riot control after he balks st the election numbers and refusing to leave the White House.
Haha... Nobody can make the Best President of America Look Dumb!  Not even Trump if he tried because it would be too good and we know he is always about being Best!
Im 71 years old. Yeah I'm remember getting heck in emails and calls for not jumping on the Trump Train by my retired friends. As a retired Railroad conductor I told them your headed for a train wreck.
Only difference between Trump and Schicklegruber.  There is none.
Well looks like the Trump Express finally  off the rails.
Trump called it a Hoax, every governor like mine Governor Stitt jumped on the Trump Express to death.  Fine example we need Joe Biden &amp; the way we handle heath care in this country. Scary part. COVID-19  just getting started. I'm look at a quarter million deaths by Christmas
2. Ps: Ma predicted Obama  would be POTUS  two months after he was elected to the US Senate and in 2016 predicted Trump would be another Mussolini.  After she passed away look all over the house for her crystal ball. Didnt find it.
Paw patrol wasn‚Äôt cancelled apparently. Cops &amp; live pd had low ratings (everyone moving to streaming). LEGO police station was limited. But guess what? Even if they were all cancelled because of police backlash GOOD at least someone is listening unlike Trump and this bitch puppet
However, life under the democrats doesn‚Äôt suck. When President Clinton and President Obama were in office I didn‚Äôt fear for our future as a nation. Bush and trump have never been able to remove the fear of 1984 from my mind. üòæüòæüôÄüôÄ
My personal hell year was 2016. This year hasn't come close to that year for me, personally. Sucks for the world though. Especially if Trump stays in office
anti defund the police Commercial just  WRECKED  The defund the police movement.  I just turned on the tv and almost spit out my drink.  Get'em President Trump!  I say, better training and policy to eject and reject bad cops but not defund.
I lost below negative respect for the media when these idiots keep asking about Trump sending Fed Officers to areas.  They pretend to not understand the Feds are protecting Federal Property and yes the President has a right to that.  Liars.
And I don't agree with everything that Trump or Biden stand for but sometimes you have to look at the greater good and pick something.  No organization is perfect. Not even BLM.   But there is a problem and they're the closest to bring changes about.  So just kneel to support.
Can You Explain to Trump how this works?  My God could you imagine?   He would bankrupt all communist news networks and papers.  Fake news It would all be over.  Trump could say, I ended fake news!

Trump canit count.  350 million against 75,000?
I just wished we could turn a key for Trump. A door to a rubber room!  One thing for sure. Ma hit it right in 2016. "Trumps another Mussolini". Ma keeps a crystal ball under her bed. She predicted Obama be POTUS 2 months after he was elected as a US SENATOR.
Hey you can Trust Trump. NOT!
Mite as well. Trump writes Hitler
These Fascist trying to start a Civil War so Trump can have his little Coup D'etat.
I think the chicken got more brains than Trump.
Trump had ignored dang near every word of the US Constitution. US Code and Bill of Rights the day he took office. I'm beginning to believe he thinks a POTUS supposed to be a dictorship.
Needs to be charges with neglect homicide like the rest of the Trump demonstration!
Lots of people have been on calls to hear the President talk.  I remember a call with Obama and didnt care or even listen.  Id go nuts if I had a call with President Trump, it would be super exciting.  He seems like a real down to earth guy.
Sen. Grassley it took over 140,500 American lives &amp; Jacksonville, Fl. now the epicenter of the world for COVID-19.Trump really cared about the people set his ego aside &amp; listened to CDC doctors in 2019. Its about saving his own skin!
Wise men seek good Counsel. Trump lacking in that department.

This was 1950 the Trump adminstration  would be standing line taking turns in the electric chair.
Like your story in Yahoo news about credit cards. My Mother 85 yrs old survived the Great Depression on the day Trump elected or stole the election Made a suggestion to the whole family. Pay off your Bill's &amp; charge cards ASAP. Trumps another Herbert Hoover!
Heck my 85 year old Mother slam dunked Trump in May 2016.  "Trumps another Mussolini"!
When talking about Trump. Thorozine anyone?
My favorite class attending college in Iowa the 1990s. "Behavior Observation  and Written Documentation". We studied out if the DSMR-3. Trump was the average person on the streets. He would be doing Thorozine Shuffle in a nut house.
And the 38% that supports Trump mite not be around by election due to COVID-19
Unemployment records are bogus. Trump adm. dont count people that has giving up  looking for work due to manly Companys that will never reopen even after the Pandemic is over. Hoover Hoover Republicans gave out bogus numbers as well in 1932. Look for Hoovervilles on very soon
Like my 85 year 9ld Mothers stated in 2016. She saw right thru Trp. Quote "Trump was another Mussolini".
Vets here at Ft Ft Sill were cleaning locking and loading  the day after Trump stole the election. 2016 my 85 year 9ld Mother warned the family  Trump was another Mussolini. Trump thinks people are stupid
The 15-minute video, posted online Thursday, is the latest maneuver to get the former president involved in the 2020 campaign for his former vice president, as Biden tries to rebuild Obama's winning coalition in November.
Right. Omg... Some of these Dem(Wits) voting for Old lost his mind Biden after his lies, plagerism, racism, failed 40+ years in Governement.  Trump needs to create a task force to help Dem(Wits).
GOP senators and President Donald Trump are at odds over priorities, and Democrats say it‚Äôs not nearly enough to stem the health crisis, reopen schools and extend aid to jobless Americans.
It's not only Trump. The people backing him have an agenda dating to 1933. Remember Bush41 sending military grade weapons to the police, Bush43 after 9/11 created Homeland Security. Prescott Bush involved in attempted Coup D'etat was Bush43 Grandfather. We are in Coup D'etat!
Trump and Barr teling the same lies Hitler told before he took over Germany. We are in the middle of a Coup D'etat  that failed in 1933.
Trump and Barr preaching the same propaganda and lies Hitler used before he took over Germany!
Trump and McConnell going back to the Good old days. Hoovervilles on steroids coast to coast.
If Trump really took a psychic  evaluation like a working stiff from the streets he would be doing the Thorozine Shuffle in a nut House.
I wonder after 20 million familys are evicted in  August what they going to call the shanty towns known as Hoovervillesin 193?  Trump Republicans refusing to help the working class like Herbert Hoover in 1932. Pullup your boot straps a common comment from Republicans in 1932.
I second that! The ayes have it and the motion is carried! Trump is a terrorist and a traitor. üòπüòæüôÄ
If Trump doesn't change and I dought with  his mental problems. He will die a lonely old man.
Why do we have dumb ass people like this woman trying to pitch this shit and she's Chicago's Mayor? No wonder they can't stop all the crime in chicago,they're too busy trying to throw shade on trump.
Ever wonder what Harry Truman would say about Trump?  ARTILLERY officer WWI. Truman elected to the US Senate 1934 served as POTUS 1945-1953.  Broke when 1st elected 1934, went home broke in 1953.  " An honest public servant can't  become rich in politics"
You ever see a cute guy and go üòªüòª &amp; then find out he‚Äôs a trump supporter and immediately get turned off. Yeah same, bc um ew gross ü§í
Republicans against trump is a start. However, I think Republicans turned independent against trump would be more powerful. üôÄüôÄüòæüòæ
That and the false claim Trump said to drink bleach and put uv lights in your body.  Which he never did.  I assumed Demwits were only trollin but I am afraid they actually believe he said that.  They actually hear him say that in their heads.
Not gonna say you‚Äôre wrong, because you‚Äôre not. But I do know of a U.S. government professor who set up the whole class to favor democratic views and also took off 3 weeks of class when Trump was elected. Lol That may be a little biased. Politics are just so damn polarized rn
It‚Äôs not just the magats getting to me these days. For the life of me I can‚Äôt understand how anyone opposed to trump can still call themselves a republican. üôÄüôÄüòæüòæ

until trump is removed from office i'm mad at every adult who voted for him in 2016 and who didn't even bother voting against him or at all.
Trump in a full lens attempted Coup D'etat  like 1933 that failed. Only thus time his cronie dusted off the play book, got thier duckys in line this time.
The Trump Republican Party think they can win the 2020 election causing chaos in the streets, using his police powers to keep you safe from the BLACKS, COVID-19 &amp; blaming China, Liberals for countrys problems and stating he's a Leader. A rerun of 1932 Germany!
Lmao...   The majority of Deaths in the US. Was from New York.  Demo Killier Cumo put covid positive in Nursing homes.  Then other officials told citizens to go spread that virus goodness on subways and to mingle.  So... Explain how this china virus is Trump virus?
My 85 year old Mothe cried watch photos like this. She stated during the in 1932 children starved in this country with bloated bellies. She stated she was one of them. This country going to have hungry children as well &amp; Hoovervilles on steroids  by the time Trump  gets done. .
‚ÄúIn January, ... Trump declared that America‚Äôs relationship with China ‚Äúmight be the best it‚Äôs been in a long, long time,‚Äù praising Chinese President Xi Jinping weeks after inking a first-step trade deal with the country. Flash forward to July:...‚Äù
‚ÄúThe question is how many tests are being done with results coming back within a day, where the individual tested is promptly isolated and their contacts are promptly warned.‚Äù
Ha. No. Trump tells us all we need to know.  Books ha have you headd of the internet!  Dum.
I can honestly say that I respect him, even though I don‚Äôt agree with some of his positions, because he has ALWAYS been consistent in his opinions about trump.
Trump is a master at making a deal.  If he did this it was awesome and probably the best way.  Trump can do no wrong.
Wtf.....But Trump can kill, sell us out and he‚Äôs still the fucking President??üò°üò°üò°
Sorry about the cussing. This is how Trump treats the our US Military.
The Trumpers should have listen to my 85 year old Mother in May 2016. She stated Trump was another Mussolini!

The Trump administration will pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for a December delivery of 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine the pharmaceutical company is developing.
Yeah, sure! What‚Äôs the Chinese govt gonna do? Delay trademarks &amp; patents to trump family members, raise the minimum wage for the slave labor &amp; stop rent price gouging &amp; speculation? Please, Han nationalist govt of China is just as corrupt as the GOP!
Trump‚Äôs derision towards China is merely election year propaganda &amp; no more significant than trump‚Äôs actions towards Russia. Trump brands &amp; crime family businesses rely on Chinese manufacturing &amp; government cooperation.üôÄüòæ #TrumpIsACoward #TrumpIsAFailure

Hey it worked for Hitler. Trump even putting troops on the ground to start another Reichstag  event. Dictators are always predictable.
Many more predicted to die. Trump and his cronies should be charged with manslaughter.
Trump thinks he can write his own Constituion. To bad Susan Collins weaseled out and let the felon stay in the White House.  Now shes weasling out and turning in him.  .
You could tell with his smart smirk on his face he was lying thru his teeth. Guess he thinks the people are stupid. Trump attempting another Reichstag event. Doesn't take rocket science Blackwater sending in thugs starting trouble like the Minneapolis cops breaking store windows
These people are Blackwater contractors beating up people.  What Trump is doing attempting to create another  Reichstag  event to declare martial law. FYI  DHS was created by Bush43, his grandfather attempted a Coup D'etat  in 1933. Same goal today a Fascist dictatorship.
Trump using DHS setting up another Reichstag  fire event to declare  martial law. Even NRA stated years ago Jack booted police power will take or freedoms or kill us under the color if law is legal. We in trouble!
How can you post this? I am conservative and not a fan of Trump, but people like you make people like us very angry. An absolute hypocrite. Misleading. Fake news because thousands of people will see your post and make you think it takes place here.
More Trump storm troopers at work.
So was Mom in 2016.  "Trump's another Musdolini"!
Trump just sold out every Red State Governor in the nation.
Amen. A Hitler move in my books! Trump doesn't plan to leave office.
Doesn't take rocket science she has dirt on Trump hidden in a special place for a Get Out Of Jail card.
Hate to break it to #GeorgeWill about voting for Trump.  My 85 year old Southern Baptist Mother that voted for Reagan  warned the family in May 2016. Trumps crazy and "Another Mussolini"!
Dodge Ball. Trump and Republicans dodge questions   like  a 7th grade dodge ball team.If Trump was an ice cream flavor, he would be pralines, and diiiiiiiiiiick.
So it seems like a more productive strategy for progressive to be more calculated and strategic about pushing him in that direction. Just clapping back and treating him the same way we do Trump is why we lose and our ideas have zero shot
A President trying to deflect attention from the 33% drop in GDP today. Don‚Äôt fall for it. Focus on the worst economy in American history, all thanks to Trump incompetence. He wants to hide that with sensational nonsense. Don‚Äôt let him!! #TrumpFailedAmerica #TrumpEconomyDisaster
I feel deep inside that I need to do everything in my tiny human capacity to get rid of Trump. Everything else seems secondary. Republicans beat us not because of their policy but because they are willing to stomach more for their fucked idea of the greater good.
I was on the phone with my father during this. I told him I'd hang up so he could hear. So I missed a ton. He is the age of Trump at 74. He is a part time employee at his living quarters. It's HUD housing. All old people. I tried to get him top register! But it failed...
He chose to go to the rally no one forced him. However Trump was not a good example of how to prevent coronavirus from spreading.
A gift from Trump, I guess, the worst disaster to ever hit America.
I am more inclined to think that Calabresi sees a GOP wipeout due to trumpism and notwithstanding the fact he rode the trump train until now he wants off to position himself to influence in the new Conservative party. He‚Äôs a hateful, selfish bastard. So fuck that guy!

Did Trump just kick a beehive? Do we need a new foe in the whole of Europe, because this is how it's done. Sure, they don't have an aircraft carrier (maybe the French do). Maybe they are, as a whole, militarily weaker...but do we need a three front war?  That's what we'll get.
I wonner what the Generals think? LOL. But really? Are they like just yes men now, thankful for their positions or are they like Mattis? Few men (and yes, it's men again) are as honoraale as James Mattis.  These men were there for that, and remain. Is our military a Trump group?
I got to thinking about the virus and Trump not doing a damn thing about it. What if that‚Äôs exactly the point, that no one comes out to vote because of the virus. They are right now, doing everything they can do, to make it harder to vote! Don‚Äôt stop..vote!
is wanting to move the Election Date, he has no legal authority! Trump is going to try also to make voting more difficult, so he can win. He will do anything to win. But in the end..we the people, decide who our leader is and you must get out and vote vote vote!!

How long has Trump been in power? Even if what you say is true, he has over 3 years to prepare. And failed. Now we have 150,000+ Americans dead.

Trump will NOT be able to delay the election. Congress could, thus we‚Äôd have #PresidentPelosi That‚Äôs why  will not go for the idea.
Of course he  will.
But  said it was the perfect place to restart trump‚Äôs energetic campaign! Are you saying burger boy is ... umm ... full of PPP?
Did he know he was sacrificing his life for trump just to go to a campaign rally?
Wait did someone say Trump's not leaving???? Huh
And if he tries it, the US Constitution says he and Pence are OUT of office on January 20, 2021,  is next in line to the presidency until the election is held. That‚Äôs why Congress would never permit that to happen. Trump is fully delusional. OR welcome #PresPelosi
Most of what Trump does violates American law. This choice is not his to make. Congress decides and  won‚Äôt allow    or anyone else change it.
Herman Cain: His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, tweeted a photo of himself without a mask at the event, which was attended by several thousand people.
Yep. Need to have people stop sharing it. There are plenty actual bad statements by Trump to amplify.
Trump has 0 understanding of American history. So he can't intentionally dog whistle. All he can do is hear complaints and respond to those.  But that isn't dog whistling, because that would require knowledge of history. Trump has admited to writing more books than he's read...
Trump‚Äôs next move?

How can anyone think trump is decisive and strong when he changes his message every day.  He tweets dangerous information from questionable sources saying how great the person, then says he doesn't know anything about the person when confronted?

If I have learned anything from the last 4 years, it‚Äôs that there is no bottom for the GOP. Trump could strip buck naked at the podium while singing the Russian national anthem and they would rush to his defense.
I would not take this at face value. If he was for law or supportive of police or Trump. If he opposed insane mayor. I can say he was murdered until proven otherwise. Very sad. He has a kind face unlike the hate visages of most dims

He‚Äôs doing an excellent job, regardless of the Dems constant efforts.  I admit he‚Äôs probably not diplomatic in some of his ways and he may be a little rough around the edges but that‚Äôs President Trump and he has done wonderful things for our country.
and  when will you two pathetic sycophants find a single vertebrae to say and do something about trump‚Äôs treasonous aide time Russia?
The POTUS can move the date his first term ends. On January 21, Trump‚Äôs first term ends. Period.
Trump‚Äôs going to be in prison in a couple of years and his worshippers will still be saying that he‚Äôs just playing ‚Äú5th dimensional chess‚Äù and that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all coming out,soon. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù They think they‚Äôve woken up and all they‚Äôve done is slip into a coma. WAKE UP!
I think we still have guards in prison, perhaps not very skilled, like those guarding #JeffreyEpstein, but guards, nonetheless. The a Trump family can enjoy those. Not free, but cheaper than what they have now.
Question: What is something trump uses as excuse for secret police invading American cities &amp; illegally arrest innocent BLM protesters b/c the RACIST-in-chief doesn't like their message? Reason #2 for #WhyIDontLikeTrump
Dumber than dumb donnie is just an asset for Putin, even allowing him to place bounties on American soldier's heads, &amp; will do WHATEVER Putin wants him to do--even at the expense of Americans! I'll take Biden over Putin/trump any day!!! #1 of #WhyIDontLikeTrump
It‚Äôs because Leftist Democrats want absolute control of government. You stand in their way. They must turn public opinion against you.  Trump questions how Fauci has a high approval rating 'but nobody likes me'
I am MORE THAN READY to replace trump a**-kisser Lindsey Graham with Jaime Harrison!!!
I don't like trump b/c he's a narcissistic, pathological liar, bully, greedy, amoral, life-long sexual abuser, misogynist, climate change denier, anti-science, xenophobe, racist old man who lacks empathy, knowledge, &amp; basic common decency! #WhyIDontLikeTrump
when ur tryna get a new job and the company values neutrality in politics u gotta become an anon and still share the dank anti trump memes :/
Duraham must finish before September, or the DOJ should be disbanded,  work papers taken from them &amp; read to the Senate.  It‚Äôs more important for Trump &amp; voters to know what happened in 2016 than to prosecute the perpetrators.  If not known, postpone the Presidential election.
Yep. It‚Äôs been a long decade since trump got elected!
good idea... vote for new Dem leadership to work with Trump üòÇ
Trump is a Nazi is the sign of a beta male
That‚Äôs what Trump thinks.
The questions were almost too hard.   If they had been more difficult Biden would have started saying the questions came from Trump and refused to answer.
Why would he? Lewis bitched about Trump constantly.
Well this is FUN! And I love to hear it! Showing  some love in this Cancel Trump bop!   Hey        check this out!

Leave and it will be great again. By the way it's not the China virus it's the Trump virus because of your failure.
Reporter - "Why should voters vote for you vs voting against Trump?" Biden - "Huh?".... incoherent answer

Old folks problems? If that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶ And we all know it is‚Ä¶ He should not be the president of the United States of America! We need someone with a smart brain and fully in charge of his faculties. Vote Trump.
Any religion that begins with the premise that Trump is God's chosen vehicle and his prophet is a non-starter
Can't wait til Trump takes them.all down. And show the public how Sick and Evil they are...Soon then BOOM
Democrats riot thinking they'll somehow blame Trump for what they promote and allow in their cities (or when they don't get their way). This is one evil bunch, and most folks with a little sense see right through their Alinsky-Marxist maneuvers.

If Biden wins Florida by +8, this will be an historic ass kicking for Trump. If Biden barely wins Florida, he will win the general pretty confortably.

Hilarious thread showing #maga crowd doctor who likes hydroxychloroquine and thinks sex with demons is the cause of illness. So on brand for 2020. Is it her Retweet by Trump that Twitter removed as false? Right, #KAG bunch, have at it.
I think Trump ends up winning Texas by 4% but the idea that Texas *could* flip for this election would be the biggest middle finger by the voters since...ever?
New international polls show what the world thinks of Trump's screw-ups, and it's not pretty
No ‚Äúnew tone‚Äù from Trump, no new tune. He lives off key, always discordant, it always hurts our ears.

I had no control over it at all. I wish it had never even been considered. Once it was here, I look for silver linings. The fact it was a major bust, Trump was humiliated, and the whole arena didn‚Äôt test positive for #Covid19 is the silver lining I found. #trumpRallyFail.
So you prefer four more years of Trump. Pathetic. Work to make change once Trump is out. With Trump in a second term, both Medicare and Social Security will be GONE for all.

I still think it worked out for Trump to experience a mammoth fail, more than he would ever have believed possible. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt matter what I think after the fact. It‚Äôs over, it was a huge failure, Trump was humiliated,  demoted. I‚Äôll take that.
Doesn't matter what Trump says. Both passed by veto proof votes.
National Guard Command to testify before Congress. Excessive force used.
Trump and his cohorts don't seem to understand the difference between confidence and desperation.  The Dems don't need a dog and pony show to get their point across to the American voters.  All they have to do is point to the GOP's many missteps over the past 3.5 years.
National Guard Command to testify before Congress. Excessive force used.
Trump's answer is to make things worse.
Trump will always be the mean old man in the neighborhood who wears knee-high socks and yells at kids from his porch.  He's just a miserable old man.
Common sense really. It sounds like you have no sense at all. What treason did he commit. Trump has committed treason and that fact must have went right over your head. You trump people are pathetic you just repeat what you hear without knowledge of it
And trump thinks kids aren't susceptible.
President Donald Trump  Is not responsible for the protests. He's not responsible for the Chinese virus. He's not responsible for slavery. He's not responsible for the destruction seen in some states and cities.  Wake the fuck up people. You either want law and order or anarchy.
Lol Biden is not worse off than trump in that regard and Trump is completely clueless about his own agenda. Which he doesn‚Äôt have. Biden will be fine in the debates.
Having issue with people kneeling during the playing of our National Anthem...  Does NOT make me or others a racist. Good grief, people are desperate to find reasons to pillage our cities, blame Trump and ALL white folks...and truth is they really just hate themselves.
It‚Äôs Perplexing that every possibility that Trump had done something wrong was pursued by the perpetrators who did the wrong.  Fortunately, Key Republican House Members had created a paper trail the perpetrators could not escape from or Trump would have been framed.  JUSTICE????
At this point in 2016, Trump and Hillary were basically tied. Biden has a 10% lead right now. Biden isn‚Äôt gonna duck the debates. He has no reason to.
That's ok President Trump.  You got more important things to do. You're  the best.
President Trump inact the Inseraction in Portland and Seattle! The everyday people are suffering from it. It will not hurt your reelection. The mayors and governors are complete idiots.
If tRump would pull his nazi troops out of battle things would be ok, instead this all shows how much of a coward and failure he is! He is not for law and order! This is his warm up before losing the Presidency! üò°
Dims/media getting more savage by the hour. Raging and screaming with violence threats lies as their fear spirals at the realization that Trump will be triumphant. Hold on America. We can do it. All 50 Trump 2020 !!

Probably built by a friend of Trump‚Äôs!
This is Awesome! Trump 2020
I agree Mr Graham but your support of Donald Trump is a deal breaker.
I have a serious question?  Where do All you lefties get President Trump‚Äôs  personal itinerary knowing how often and what days he golfs?  Or are you just talking out your A$$?  I assume the latter is accurate.
Protesting/Rioting has been going on for 60 days! Weeks before Trump sent federal forces in!
Joe's propaganda showing clips that have nothing to do with Trump &amp; everything to do with Democrat-run cities. Anyone else notice that?
Trump would get blamed even more
Am I bad for grinning as I watch Hurricane Hanna topple Trump‚Äôs dumb border wall like it‚Äôs made out of sticks?
Hypocrisy? Let‚Äôs start with  Obama saying we needed border control from Mexico. When Trump makes that a platform, hell breaks loose on the left.
Thank God for President Trump everyday.
You jest,  of course!  Can you really imagine bumbling Biden with access to the Nuclear Button!  Think big picture!  Trump trying to get us out of Wars...Biden helps send pallets of cash to people who want to kill you!  No to Hiden Biden!
The trump campaign has more HATRED, according to many, than any campaign in the history of this formerly great country.  A country once a strong world power has been decimated and eroded by the egomaniac in the white house. We are now a 3rd world country carrying a gucci bag.

I had a joke about  but Trump can't seem to grasp it
What does Hillary, Obama, and Trump have in common?   They're all in the "Can't Club".
If you've been in politics for 30 plus years and blame Trump for everything that happened since the end of the Civil War....  You might have stupid constituents.  It's insanity to blame Trump for anything from their past incompetence.
‚ÄúWe the voters‚Äù &amp; Trump will be lucky if truth is irrevocably illuminated in time for the November election.   Negative inertia resisting truth,  pushing disinformation &amp; IMPEACHMENT created a 3-year snails pace of discovery &amp; truth in communications.  DEMOCRAT COMMUNISM!!
False patriots support trump. Richard is a good man and worth the follow.
Not every Trump supporter is a racist but every racist appears to be a Trump supporter
Trump's fault? Priceless ignorance. Obama built that.

Everything trump touches dies.  Scary that it is coming true
One of the silliest comparisons is Trump to Reagan. Reagan was one of, if not the, best POTUS when it came to speaking for ALL in times of uncertainty. Trump divides people on purpose.
Biden‚Äôs taking so long picking a running mate because he‚Äôs planning an 11th hour run at Trump‚Äôs base by picking the Confederate Flag.
No, Trump cannot stay on message or do as his staff directs for more than a day or two. His ego won‚Äôt permit him to stop riling up his base. He is the least disciplined person I have had to observe.
I seriously don‚Äôt understand why people hate trump... if you step back and forget about his attitude towards others, and just look at the good that he‚Äôs done... anyone can see that he is for the people and only the people!!!!  #Trump2020LandslideVictory

Schools and hospitals suffering in Tulsa due to the spike in virus cases after Tulsa agreed to host 6,000 people here mostly from out of state, in the middle of getting played by Trump and Musk. Awesome. Well done  ,  ,
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. It‚Äôs their call who they vote for and shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed for it. I know I‚Äôm not gonna sit and be pinned down because I refuse to vote for any of the democrats. Trump ain‚Äôt perfect(there is no perfect candidate) but I ain‚Äôt voting for Biden.

Oh we know Tim. If this was a real pandemic people would be dying in front of you and on the streets not just in hospitals. That is why Trump took over getting the numbers so he can do them accurately to get this thing gone. A little late in the game for masks!
This shows that in actual personal interactions, Trump is a very nice guy. He was so gracious to Dave's father even though he doesn't like Trump. Trump just wants to be liked
Oregon Politicians‚ÄîJust like National Democrats blaiming Trump for what the Democrats have been doing.   When are the Republicans going to wake up and force the truth to occur?

Preet, is it too to much to ask if during one of the debates, a commentator asks trump, "What were the five(5) things listed on question #10 on the Alzheimer's test?"    ijs
FOCUS. Virus is Chinese Based. The unplanned, uncoordinated shutting down of businesses tanked local economies. I know it's hard, but look into actual causes. Blame on Trump is giving the guy way too much credit.
Preet, let's be real here;  Trump said, "he got extra points", for getting the words right - and in the right order..  So if he got 35 points - out of 35 answers, how many of his "extra points" were used?  ijs
Nobody understands dementia like Trump, that I can tell you.  He understands it better than anyone in the history of the world.  Nobody‚Äôs ever come close.
Even better is Mike Pence.  He stands by Trump during speeches with little hearts dancing above his head and such a look of love on his face.  It‚Äôs just precious

You say you can‚Äôt fathom why anyone would vote Trump. But I feel the same about why would anyone vote Biden. I have researched Trump, I have lists of things that he has done that are good. I have lists of bills he has passed for the American people but not one...
The Dems running the cities created this chaos and lawlessness.  Trump has offered help over and over again and they reject it.  But he's now going to do something about it anyway.
This is one suburban mom who WILL vote for Donald Trump because I know what's at stake, OUR FREEDOM!

Trump Jr‚Äôs girlfriend was diagnosed about two weeks later. Tulsa saw a spike in cases in following weeks.  (possibly from rally &amp; protests).  1/2
I do believe that's where POTUS Trump is headed, first the WHO and then the UN.
Trump should have been there.  It was necessary that he attend.  And yet...everything is better without Trump. He sullies everything he touches.
"I guess she could just drag him out of the White House her self?" This, but like...unironically. Our legal/justice system will not do its job and our election system is rigged. Trump LOST the popular vote (the only vote that should matter) in 2016 but still became prez.
love you President Trump. Thank you for bringing God back to the White House, thank you for supporting Jerusalem and moving our embassy to Jerusalem. I have your back. God bless you. I pray a hedge of protection around you and your family in the name of Jesus.

I found his speech very hypocritical . Remember when Obama used tear gas, rubber bullets and water on natives in freezing cold weather? Those were actual peaceful protestors. What trump is dealing with are actual violent protestors attacking police officers and federal property.
Brainwashed my family. Took them from me. Makes me sad to know amount of time lost spending &amp; talking with my Dad &amp; Brother since 2016. I'll never forgive Trump for it. My Dad has suffered unemployment/increased taxes under Trump &amp; Brother increased taxes. Too proud to admit it.
I find it funny that you are laughing but Trump is running ads in OKLAHOMA
I‚Äôd pay money to watch Trump listen to this while hooked to a heart monitor.
Hey genius, what‚Äôs Trump!?!
Let's not pretend that Biden is an even decent candidate. He's simply "not Trump". That's his redeeming quality.
Don't think he's asking for em to be psychic - just to actually act accordingly as information becomes available. If Trump's that worried about mail-in ballots, common sense would dictate you strengthen the entity tasked with getting said ballots where they need to go on time.
I think that says something to the blind trust, or at least the facade of public support, that the RNC has given to Trump.  Just like 2016, I would've rather had almost any other candidate - like you, but there are only 2. So I will be reluctantly supporting Biden.
Trump won today. Everybody focused on that one stupid tweet.  He knows very well that moving the election is 100% a 0% possibility. Yet the media ran with it like a greyhound chasing a fake rabbit.

Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
Only a tacky Obama provides the enthusiasm needed to guarantee a win for the dotard #Biden.  If it‚Äôs Michelle, trump will make bulge jokes since she a Tranny.  I think Biden will put Barack on the ticket as vp, but he‚Äôll resign later in favor of a real freak, like Eric Holder.
I do offer my sympathies to the family of Herman Cain. He fought for what he thought was right. On the other hand, Donald Trump knew what was wrong and did it anyway in a supreme act of self promotion. In short, he believed in his own lies and people died because of it.
The problem is that Bush's awfulness doesn't even touch Trump's. There are different levels of bad.  I never liked Bush, but I will take him back in a second.
you know you‚Äôve made an oopsie when the federalist society (?!?!) calls you a fascist

Trump has never read the constitution. I mean, after all, it is long, in attorney speak and, most importantly, doesn't mention him.
Well thats what happens when u have a mouth full of trump, he cant get enough.
It is his own damn fault!! A mask could have saved his life but Trump murdered him along with 151,000 other Americans
is a complete failure as a leader. What he does at this point isn‚Äôt surprising. He‚Äôs a trump fan boy
‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù people, people that don‚Äôt wear masks, people that believe that #DemonSperm video is true, people that support their arguments with memes and Trump supporters are no longer qualified to speak to me I‚Äôve decided. I have a ‚Äúminimum IQ‚Äù requirement.
There is no proven fact of voter fraud! Get over yourself. It is just that Trump is losing is all, BIGLY
Don't be surprised when Capeheart says this about Trump.
A REAL president would stop the voting by mail fear-mongering &amp; get educated himself on the rules and do everything to insure timely, safe &amp; secure voting for all Americans. Trump is lying &amp; spreading misinformation about voting - "2020 fear campaign."
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand there it is, folks. The Trump Declaration of Treason.  Resign.
Also, not holding guys like Dubs, Rumsfeld, Rove and Cheney accountable for their crimes is how you get Trump.
He is being forced to read a script now. That was not Trump talking.
Compare Obama's eloquence today to Trump's meandering English mangling, nonsensical lies.

So puking fed up with the imbecile WH press corps. Not one question about why trump‚Äôs Post Master General is crippling deliveries by eliminating overtime. Paying 75 yrs retirement in advance is destroying the USPS. FUND THEM!  Youth are not immune -THEY ARE SUPER SPREADERS!
You can't say Trump isn't thinking ahead.
Trump admin is counting in a fun way that actually subtracts instead of adds.
Jorgensen doesn‚Äôt have a chance and we need Trump gone for the good of our country.
Yeah, pretty much all the jobs created in his first year to two can be attributed to Obama. It just takes time for a lot of that stuff to start working, but trump destroyed all of Obama‚Äôs and his own accomplishments due to his inability to properly handle Covid.
You think that maybe a contagious virus from China that turned into a worldwide pandemic had anything to do with that?  You actually blame Trump for it.  Which is an indication that you‚Äôre insane.
Why did Trump and republicans cancel the rally in Florida? Are they afraid of a repeat of Tulsa, OK?
- Just now Trump indicated that young people are immune to Covid. He is so clearly misled and misinformed.
Avoiding fact has always been a Trump strong point.

President Trump needs to make sure Democrats don‚Äôt get to stuff the ballot boxes. Observers should be at each polling place! Cameras should be used extensively.  If they stuff the ballot boxes, president Trump is gone! Prevention beats proving democrats cheated! AGAIN!

This may be the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read. Catching a virus when you are in a vulnerable state and being murdered are completely different. If you think Trump never existing would ensure Herman would still be alive, then you are living in a deranged world dude.

Good thing for Trump Cain signed that rally waiver.
The founders would have tried Donald Trump, Bill Barr and Mike Pompeo for treason.
Listening to Barack Obama is to listen to a President of the United States. Listening to Donald Trump is to listen to a cheap carnival barker working a midway scam.
The worst President to ever exist! #TrumpThreatensAmerica The USA is falling apart and he is doing NOTHING but talking about he wants to postpone the election. UM no we will all DIE if you stay President! You‚Äôre a failure #Trump
i don‚Äôt believe trump has a chance of actually delaying the election, however considering his history of blatantly violating the constitution for personal benefit, i don‚Äôt find it abnormal to be concerned by the suggestion
If Putin did a shot every time Trump did him a favor the man  wouldn't be able to walk.
Attention President Trump
This is an honest question.  Trump is just trolling with the whole election delay talk, right?  This is just misdirection. He knows he can't do it, and it would never happen. Right?
Well the overhaul we got by electing Donald Trump was a catastrophe. So sure, let's trust the Louis Dejoy, someone with no experience, overhaul the USPS. My Uncle is a retired Post Master &amp; I was born in the home of the Pony Express. I proudly support the USPS.
Yea because trump aimed the virus at Cain and shot him with it.
So if you ever doubted the wisdom of three branches of government.....two legs of the stool broke off but somehow the courts are balancing it on one leg!    Appeals court will reconsider order to dismiss criminal case of former Trump aide Michael Flynn
Who ever gave the coronavirus to  also gave it to  at the Trulsa Trump Rally.  I wonder who that person was and I wonder if any one else who attended the rally became sick and or died?
Is that from the Trump campaign? Maybe it's a compliment.
Okay. I can‚Äôt think of one Democrat who would delay an election in hopes of causing such chaos and voter depression. Fuck tRump #NeverBidenNoMore
I imagine the 34% is Trump‚Äôs base.
Then by this moronic logic he died because he went to a trump rally then shouldnt everyone who went be dead by now its been 6 weeks. Hmmmm
Yeah, because if you support America you‚Äôre more than likely a Trump supporter üòÇ  See the problem here?
Trump never even actually wanted the job, he actively hates it, but he's gonna have to be dragged out of the White House by a SEAL team because his maniacal brain cannot accept defeat
In the face of destruction of statues and rewriting of history by Democrats. Trump protects peaceful protest and freedom of speech censorship from big tech backed by CCP. This guy has the audacity to glaze over actual human rights violations and goes straight to Trump is hitler.
So do we have any data regarding drone strikes under the Trump administration?
These things are NEVER based on race. Usually just basic economics, and safety. These politicians either know that and dont care because its against their agenda, or are just playing stupid to blame yet something else on Trump.

Noone deserves to lose their life to Covid. Only wish all Republicans would take precautions to protect us. Unlike Trump did for him. Trump could've saved his life. Did he take Trumps miracle drug? If so, Drs warned this could happen. Sry for your loss
I just read some assinin tweet from Trump and just want to scream.  I will run walk crawl to vote him out November 3rd.

They are trying to blame Herman Cains death on the Tulsa trump rally that is total bullshit
According to 3 USC ¬ß2, if electors are left undetermined after a state election, the state government allocates electors. Makes me wonder. Could states with GOP led govts finagle that somehow? Doubtful, but with complicit SCOTUS, I'd say possible. Still, Trump couldn't order it.
Ngl if Biden won trump would run again in 2024 and since Biden is a neolib who will do nothing for people, trump would have no problem winning in a few years time.
Seeing a lot of people blame Trump for the escalating COVID death toll, specifically in reference to the death of Herman Cain. Let's not diminish his role in his own demise. Went to the OK Trump rally&gt; fell ill. All while his team was tweeting right wing bs while on his deathbed.
I ain‚Äôt want the nigga to die but he risked his life for trump. So there‚Äôs that.
Is Fox News going to apologize to any of the families that have lost loved ones due to Covid? Is Trump? All of you have blood on your hands. #TrumpVirus #FoxNews
.... this could produce generational majorities in house, senate, and in state houses around the country (in a redistricting year). Trump doesn't care about those casualties. If he thinks such a ploy offers him a better chance of staying in office he won't hesitate a second.

Hitler cancelled elections then cancelled the legislative body and put himself in charge of the government. Trump could try the same if we look the other way. Dump Trump!
Nah, Trump said he was pulling out last year and just movrd 4000 troops to another section of the Mideast...
Herman Cain died, I will always think, because he attended the Trump rally in Tulsa several weeks ago.  I always thought he was a good man.  Please, friends, do everything you can to avoid this virus.  No more wasted lives.
To be sure, the service will be better off without trump. The country would be better off without him.  Hell, the entire planet would be better off without him present.We had an election during the Civil freaking War, and during WW 2.  We wouldn't even delay an election for the greatest President ever and we're damn sure not doing it for the worst.  Once again, Trump proves he knows nothing about the country.
The stupidity of the government was previously hid under a thinly veiled mask; trump has shown a spotlight on it (and his own stupidity). Postponing election but open schools. Can‚Äôt make this up
Oh I hope trump is watching this nba game.
The real October surprise. Green men are going to show up and endorse Trump. They have some next level kompromat!

You're absolutely right. Trump has always had dementia.
I‚Äôm sure Trump is disappointed. He thought the seniors would be onboard with sacrificing their lives for the economy. Turns out my 85-yo mama wants to live. Man, is she pissed.
Trump's plan is to throw journalists in jail for not telling the "truth". With Barr glued to his hip, it could actually happen. We are already seeing Americans thrown into unmarked vans. We are in seriously deep doo-doo if he wins reelection, cuz it will be bye-bye to democracy.
Trump claimed election fraud in 2016 and established a commission on voter fraud. That quietly closed down as well. Found nothing. You didn‚Äôt find that in your research either? Look it up.
Russia interfered in our last election for the benefit of Trump. That is what Devin Nunes said during the impeachment hearings. He said they issued a report of several hundred pages. Found that in your research, right? I saw his lips moving and saying those words, soooo....?
In 2016, I was 17. I was happy when Trump won. I despised Hillary Clinton and celebrated Trump's victory.  I'm ashamed of that. I'm ashamed of who I was. I'm proud and thankful that the past four years have transformed me inside and out, but I'm ashamed of where I was.
Trump has been extremely kind to Blacks. He saves them the trouble of going to the polls by suppressing their vote. Let me go back through our thread to see what facts you are ignoring.
I paid attention as this conspiracy theory has been repeatedly investigated and debunked. It was the Trump administration who finally, quietly, closed the file. Nothing there. Surely you found this in your research?
I spent 38 years in the legal industry, specifically litigation. I was trained to deal with facts and only facts. So don‚Äôt talk to me about research, pal. My bubble until Trump‚Äôs nomination in 2015 WAS the GOP. Do your research before you insult my intelligence again.
I‚Äôm sick of this, too. I voted Republican for 40 years. He has destroyed the party and made a cruel mockery of Conservatism. Another fact about me, since you didn‚Äôt ask: I didn‚Äôt like Hillary either, but I despised Trump. Still do.
Abuse humanity? After the hell I‚Äôve been through for 2-1/2 years, I know now that healthcare is a human right. I was thrilled to pay $200.11 per month under the ACA. I don‚Äôt want one damn thing for free. Trump wants to end that when millions have lost their health insurance.
It‚Äôs been feeling like this since Trump took office üòÜ
My brain is fine, thank you. I read extensively and even go on govt websites to check facts. I only deal in facts. Try it. I‚Äôm a former member of the GOP for 40 years; I left the party when Trump was nominated. I know a conman and a ü§• when I see one.
I am absolutely aware of that fact. Funny how they fell into line when Trump began his hate campaign. üòè
I‚Äôm doing plenty by way of donations and volunteering my time to make sure Trump is not elected. So there‚Äôs that. Do some due diligence and go on the government (Trump) website to see the hundreds of Dem and bipartisan bills are in Do Nothing Mitch‚Äôs graveyard. Lazy, my ass. üôÑ
Seeing way too many people joking about Kanye‚Äôs presidency. IT‚ÄôS NOT FUNNY! 2016 there were so many ‚Äújokes‚Äù about Trump becoming president and it became reality. If we don‚Äôt learn from history we‚Äôre doomed to repeat it. Take these elections seriously, peoples lives are at risk
We can trust NO data at this point. The WH controls all data now, Trump will not let medical experts speak, Dr. Fauci is being/has been slandered, and the CDC made sure to get schools open. I can't believe I'm even writing this. Who are we as a country now, America?
I have to laugh every time the GOP/Trump uses the term "elitists" to describe Democrats.  I have never seen a group of people so completely untethered to the reality everyday Americans face. This is seriously F'd up.
Nixon was an amateur compared to Trump. I have never seen anything like Trump or this enablement by the GOP in all of my 60+ years. I was a member of the GOP for 40 yrs until Trump became the nominee. Corporations over people? Nah.
Imagine not educating yourself as a senator and turning to twitter to bash women‚Äôs basketball for showing support to #BLM. Isn‚Äôt he supposed to be held to a higher standard? Who gives these people social media? Take his and trump‚Äôs social media privileges away!

Finally, in June Trump issued an executive order for a national police misconduct database but I can‚Äôt find anything on how or when it will come to fruition.
This is a disgusting abuse of power from the executive branch. The first amendment exists for this exact reason. Someone has to hold Trump accountable for the use of federal troops on his own people.

Honestly, when Trump is out of office eventually, he should honestly go to work for Barstool Sports.   Like the dude understands how branding and marketing works. It‚Äôs honestly a great match.
Might as well call it Christian Nationalism which would be self-defeating.   Let‚Äôs not change Evangelicalism, instead, just call the rest the Religious Right or Trump‚Äôs RR.
Your ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù is expected... but it‚Äôs not really relevant because you can‚Äôt compare the two. The Trump administration has stated so many irrational things that it‚Äôd be impossible for anyone to catch them. Couple that with all the lying &amp; it‚Äôs even worse.
And now a word from Trump's spokesmodel.
I'd wager fifty bucks Trump couldn't pass a test over what is actually in the Constitution.
If Trump could walk into a 2nd term over a sea of dead bodies it wouldn't bother him a bit.

It‚Äôs amazing how close our country is to full fledged fascism under Trump, and people STILL don‚Äôt realize how much is riding on the election this year.

Godspeed and good night people of the world and the United states.. oh, God stands for the United states of America to.. because that's where I was born... Go America!! Go President Trump.. see you in 4 years!
Would love to hear Trump's thoughts on Hamilton.
Lol. 3.5 yrs after tRump took charge.
Give it 2 hours...someone will find a tweet with him defending his eviction of Charles..."sad, but necessary", said Trump.
I'm not so sure about Chicago (Mike Ditka and all), but Trump has picked the wrong town to pick on with #PDX. The LIBRARIANS are vicious.
I think we know that in the Trump Administration the buck stops... well... generally in the bank account of a Trump property.
YES! I'M SO PROUD OF THIS COUNTRY WINNING THE RACE FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE/DIE FROM COVID-19 AND HOW WELL WE ARE HANDLING THE PANDEMIC! PRAISE JEEBUS AND HAIL TRUMP /s
These days, its actually pretty easy. Seriously, when Trump says its gonna get worse before its going to get better, how devastatingly bad do you think he knows its going to get?
Even though past administrations prepared for pandemics no1 predicted we would have 1 in 2020. Trump‚Äôs response has failed us. If elected in 2020, what makes any1 think he can handle the next crisis? He has nothing to gain/no election to win past 2020. We can‚Äôt afford it
As Trump would say, I wish the Starbucks employee well.
How will Biden respond if Trump asks him if America is a racist country during a debate?
Before you waste your time you should look into how that has ended for the people who did sue already.  No case has made it to trial.  In Oklahoma, a Trump Appointed Republican judge threw out such a case.  They are FULLY legal.
Trump would you do a cognitive test podcast with Joe? Side by side online??? Bring it on!
You can‚Äôt talk to me about politics and tell me you support trump if you don‚Äôt educate yourself on what he stands for. If your only argument is that people take what he says the wrong way then you clearly don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs said ü§¶üèº NEXT CALLER
Harry Reid changed the filibuster law for Judges? I warned my Brother in law it was bad! Now they want to go further. Understand what you WISH for. That‚Äôs how Trump has put 200 lifetime federal judges on the bench. Keep it up see what happens? The next election will tell......CNN's Chris Cuomo shames Trump, suggests Herman Cain died because of Tulsa rally       Cuomo is a liar ü§•.  How does he stay on the air??
I agree I think I‚Äôm just fearful some shady shit will happen and trump stays in office
you need to strongly condemn Donald trump and you also need to call your son out.
Donald trump has undermined women‚Äôs health. He‚Äôs done nothing to actually help. Then again you‚Äôre also not a real follower of Christ. If you were you wouldn‚Äôt support him period
He has zero chance of getting elected if he doesn‚Äôt debate BDD. Trump will completely destroy Biden though if they do debate.

We're so lucky we get Stitt as our governor, Trump as our president and since I live in Edmond, I'm lucky enough to have Bob O'Neil as my city's ridiculous mayor...an incompetence trifecta if you will
Agreed,  its hard to find that unity we need when there are so many...people who think what trump says is gospel! (Me being nice) ü§î
This is war?  Wear a mask and stop listening to Trump.  He killed Cain.  It is not a hoax.  Stupidity and ignorance are not leadership skills.  #TrumpDeathCult #GOP #GOPBetrayedAmerica
He's an incompetent moron who is blindly following Trump and he makes me sick ü§¨ #CountryOverParty
great idea to have the Trump rally in Tulsa. #shitshow
It's only so all the Trump supporters can say "one less...."
Trump used a national prayer breakfast to talk about himself
Dude the lovely governor of my state made the same freaking statement about Oklahoma today and I was yelling at my tv. Then I saw your post I didn't know Trump had already used the same scenario when talking. I fvcking can't stand these pandering unfeeling bastards!!
It truly amazes me that the American people think that a couple geezers, with signs of early onset dementia, are the two best options for President. #Trump #Biden
Trump is a religious cult to them.  They will literally die for him.   Jim Jones 2020
Fox's website says trump is mourning the loss of Rep. Lewis.  This is total BS and an example of real fake news.

Didn‚Äôt trump just say about a month ago that he doesn‚Äôt joke?
Let‚Äôs start with trump totally mishandling the #TrumpVirus .. go from there.
Why would anyone ask Trump, a narcissistic fool, to grade himself.
Lindsey Graham, that quote is weak. Only a resounding NO is acceptable for this outrageous suggestion by Trump to delay the election. Shame on you, where is your backbone sir? If you Republicans would stand up to him, just once, you can change things for the better of America.
And you are a joke.  Enjoy your freedom while you can.  Next year you will be under indictment.  If trump pardons you, the State of New York will get you.  There is no escape.
I miss the Sean Spicer part of the Trump Presidency.
Herman Cain died from covid-19. He was a staunch Trump supporter who refused to wear a mask and talked loudly about it. I wonder if he thought he'd be #dyingforTrump
Besides being racist and it is 50 years later, the fact the Trump campaign is running on this is so wildy odd to me since this is going on in Trump's America.  He is the president, he owns everything happening in America right now.
Yes, Trump killed Herman Cain. And that happened in Tulsa AND I predicted this death on that day. I hate that I was right.
Agreed, Mr Wyden. I hold him responsible for Herman Cain‚Äôs death. But he is also a mass murderer; more than 150,000 Americans, considered the cost of doing business, to Trump. Dismantling fair housing provisions. ha, what a legacy.
He is worried about himself, not us.  No wonder they follow Trump.  #GOP #GOPDeathCult #GOPBetrayedAmerica
No shame?  Trump led him to his death.  #WeWillVote #NobodyLikesTrump
George W. started two wars and Obama added 5 more. Trump is the only President in the past 20 years who didn‚Äôt start a war. And Biden voted for the Iraq war. That‚Äôs your candidate.
Pompeo, Barr and Trump are the new axis of evil
Another victim of Trump's Tulsa, OK rally.
I have no confidence in "should not be delayed". There have been many things on his watch that should not have happened, but they did.  Put same bass in your voice, let me know you mean what you say bc it sounds to me like groveling up to tRump.
Ya thats right, Trump is not responsible for corona deaths, CHINA IS!
If trump can mail in votes then why can't test of the country?  Vote in person fine just don't try to shut down the voting and keep people out oh and how about fix all the districts that Republicans redrew to be in their favor...
Snopes has spoken...ü§£ü§£
Suicides are up since Trump became POTUS.  I'm sure there are some having issues with this. Too bad, Trump couldn't act sooner...really shut down. We could have nipped this is the bud. Sad.
Nadler, who thinks Antifa rioting is a myth, despite all the video evidence, now thinks plainclothes police didn‚Äôt exist before Trump. And this is who heads our judiciary committee.
I am sorry he has passed, but in all due respect, he bought into the lie about Covid-19 - that masks don't matter, do whatever Trump tells you, go to a rally with 6,000 people.  He and Trump are responsible for his death.
Yet you have let Donald trump disparage and fire people who were whistleblowers
Too bad so many  listened to Trump instead of the scientific and expert medical professionals. RIP.
A few seats to the right of Mr. Cain (outside of this photo) sat Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, who also contracted the virus.  It was Stitt, a trump-puppet, who thought it was a grand idea to hold an indoor rally in the midst of a pandemic.
So, once a hoax kills an important a Trump sycophant‚Äîall of a sudden it is time to do the right things to combat this virus.   You are incapable of leading. You should resign from public service as you have only been serving your own greed and power driven ends. Shame on you!
Vote tomorrow to get trump gone
A 74-year-old died from COVID? This is unheard of. It must be because he‚Äôs a Trump supporter. I thought we were all supposed to live to be 300. What‚Äôs happening?
#TrumpKillsUs  Herman Cain died this morning of corona virus.  He attended Trump's rally in Tulsa with no mask.
always flies upside down so you shouldn't be surprised that he would support trump ignoring the Constitution
Nah, it was Trump
Nothing will have an impact until this Trump train completely derails, suffering one final Trumpublican extinction event.
Yes, Trump must see his contribution to this death.
You are correct! Trump bears some blame. He still doesn‚Äôt respect the virus.
Tulsa.  He got it at Trump‚Äôs rally
Can we all say Tulsa? Because Trump‚Äôs event in Tulsa is highly likely the place where he contracted the virus. If I were in Cain‚Äôs family, I would make sure Trump saw his part in killing him.
trump's ill-conceived Tulsa rally, in the middle of a pandemic, caused the death of former GOP Presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  There is no telling how many people were infected that evening and the coliseum was only 1/3 full.
This is the headline story today, not Trump's distraction tweet.
Are you freaking kidding me??
Nope, trump said that everyone is jealous of our testing! We have the best tests ever...ü§£ he's such a dipshit.
Apparently it also only affects those who support Trump because I have had severe asthma for about 30 years. My boyfriend has copd. We both wear our masks and are able to breathe so I guess it doesn't affect us the same üòÇ
pls stop fucking trump supporters
And that‚Äôs literally all he had to do. Bush and   did the work. All trump had to do was take the steps that 43 &amp;44 wrote but nope he couldn‚Äôt even do that

I‚Äôve always voted republican I even voted for Donald trump reluctantly in 2016. I was undecided all the way to walking in the ballot box.  In 2020 for the first time in my life I will vote for a democrat for president and every other federal office. Classical conservatives
To them.  What trump is doing with the federal officers is big time government overreach and republicans are completely quiet while they try to hammer on China for civil rights violations but don‚Äôt worry about trumps violations.
They have compromised on their values , they have compromised conservatism. They are no longer fiscal conservatives. If they were they would have said No to trump tax policy. Then there‚Äôs the whole Russia issue. Republicans have cowered to trump. Russia interfering don‚Äôt matter

He never stands up to Trump. He doesn‚Äôt represent his constituents. He does what‚Äôs best for his Campaign Donor‚Äôs he has compromised the Republican Party just the same as every other republican.
We know. Trump is a vile racist.
Joe Biden dealing with Dementia. While Donald Trump is deploying the US military against US citizens.  I gonna "waste" my vote on a 3rd party.
Adam Silver &amp;  has handled Covid-19 better than Trump administration.
Is this all just not a ploy to delay mail-in ballots as needed to effect the desire outcome of Trump? Step 1: attack mail-in ballots. Step 2: install donor to slow, delay, and disrupt mail delivery. Step 3: impact the election results.
Great Job President Trump
I hoped someone would find evidence that he reads a Trump‚Äôs tweet, the lying sack of...
That is quite possibly the worst idea since Donald Trump for President.
I don't Donald Trump has a clue of anything going on in his administration.  I guess they all think he is stupid and useless like the rest of America.
I literally delete everyone for being a trump supporter. That alone tells me what kind of person you are.
Biden isn't scary so the right is trying to tie him to rose twitter and the squad basically. It's dumb, but then Trump doesn't have much respect for his base.  And frankly they don't warrant much respect.
The company dictionary for the CNN goons probably shows the following entry under ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù: The word for a Trump claim that turns out to be true, or possibly so, or at least reasonably supportable, and which requires CNN to clean the egg and rabies froth off our faces.
Trump urinal cakes!
Someone ask Trump, in about 2 weeks, if he can remember Person. Man. Woman. Camera. TV.   Say it and say ‚Äúdo you remember these things?‚Äù    He won‚Äôt know what the fuck you are talking about.
Yes! Vote out these people! Trump, Pence, Barr, Kellyanne Conjob, Mnuchin, Miller, etc. vote ‚Äòem and disinfect the White House

I can‚Äôt make up the crazy crap that the media throws out everyday. If trump  doesn‚Äôt get re-elected they will have nothing to talk about??
Donald Trump is a lying POS and he is right, no one likes him.
I know a way around tRump‚Äôs demand that classes have to open in person - do what tRump does - simply ‚Äúredefine‚Äù what it means what it means for classes to be ‚Äúopen‚Äù - he‚Äôs way too stupid to figure it out

Odds wise. There is almost no chance the GOP takes back the house, coin toss now on the Senate, and Trump is a -150 underdog.
No book in Nevada (or offshore) has the GOP favotlred to take back the house. None.   Ladbrokes has the Democrats favored to win both the house and the senate right now and Biden 4/7 over Trump 13/8.
Anyone else notice a trend? It's almost like these people do coordinated comments on EVERY Tweet Trump puts out. The Krass, Rothschild, Tiderich, and now this Murray guy.   It must be weird to be that bored.
Hey,  you can walk on out! Nobody likes you! Stand up to trump, for once! The orange dipdshit, doesn't care about you! Do the right thing and stand up for your friends and family!  Earn your respect!
Can you explain to me what other option a president has to move the country out of a recession Carole? Obama's hand was forced (just like Trump's hand is forced right now with COVID).   It's what you do when the economy is strong that matters. Ex. Clinton paid down our debt.
Kind of sad, that if you're linked to hanging out with the president of the US, its a bad thing, and maybe something shady going on! I'm sure this is trump trying to find something that will get his numbers up!
Of course Brett Farve defrauded a charity and sent wiener pics, another best person? Maybe trump should give him a WH position.

The problem in recent years is to get Americans to spend a little bit of time and energy to pay attention and then to go vote for a good, patriotic American!  That eliminates Trump!
Do you get the feeling that Trump and his minions are setting us up for meddling by his campaign to insure a win for himself in November?
Trump is truly #AmericasGreatestMistake

Grandpa, you weren't going anyway.  The time to care about the health of the American people was March when this virus could have been controlled.  trump ignored it and so did you.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  I hear Iowans are ashamed of you.
Yeah, well that's the problem.  You wouldn't be getting your ass kicked if you would have chosen to miss some of the votes you cast over the past 3.5 years.   You were warned, but your loyalty to everything trump was greater than your love for country.  Bye Felicia.

Sorry Aunt Crabby, I trust Trump as far as you can throw him.

The issue here is that a lot people don't consider Trump support a "difference of opinion," but rather, an acceptance of racism and misogyny.
Your just mad that a massive part of this country wants law and order. These terrorists lost their rights and that's not Trump being authoritarian. That is Trump doing his job. The government is supposed to protect us from people like this.
Mitch McConnell  has a net worth of 22.5 Million!How do u think he has earned that much money.He is a thief. He is trying to rob us ‚ÄúAmerican PEOPLE‚Äù!He thinks giving us all another stimulus check is going to take away from his portion of our tax dollars.  Trump promised us more!
Trump vs Biden..  Biden gets to sleep
Poor Suzy you're forever connected to trump."...five states - [CO, HA, OR, WA, UT] - already conduct elections primarily by mail." - MS?  No problem 4 states already doing it. But NY's primry in dist 12 has been disaster.  Trump's tweet has put Congress Dems&amp;Reps AGAINST election delay. No time for mail-in preparation now.
Nah we love trump he‚Äôs shook up Washington and we are ready to do it 4 more years
Trump really one step ahead f them
Now can a case be made that Omar, AOC, etc never get elected without 2 years of Trump to shake people a little? Maybe. Is the trade off worth it? I dunno.
I enjoy seeing W &amp; Michelle together.  Their friendship and respect for each other is sweet.  Forget politics.  trump will be ostracized forever, only being included in events when it‚Äôs unavoidable.  There will be times when he still doesn‚Äôt show - if he lives much longer.
I know, me too.  But compared to trump...
trump makes W look like a genius.
Wow. Somewhere at the north pole there us probably a vault with those documents, some kryptonite, and a scratched up Capt America Shield. Someday they will surface and real justice will be done. I hope we never let anything like Trump And his minions ever happen again.

No need for 20, 50, or 100 people to tell trump he can‚Äôt change the date of the election.    Just get a copy of the Constitution &amp; highlight the part that says who CAN change it.  That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs necessary.  You know he won‚Äôt read the whole thing with all those big words.
So Obama delivers the eulogy at Congressmen John Lewis‚Äôs funeral today.... and turns it into a political speech, demonizing Trump and Republicans. My gosh I had forgotten how much I despise Obama. He reminded me today.
Even *JaredKushner* saw the need for a coordinated federal testing program. But Trump thought it would help blue states. At what point do Trump and his lackeys get tried for attempted political genocide? Botched, of course. They‚Äôre killing a lot of Red Staters. But still.
Will, you have proved your point. I'm done. Trump might be right after all. Nothing will please you guys. Nothing. All of you, read my posts before accusing me of being a Nazi sympathizer. I feel for uneducated people who are conned by a dictator. I am anti-Nazi; don't doubt it.

How about we stop Trump inviting foreign interference in our elections first, then we can work on ballot harvesting like what the Republicans did in the congressional race in North Carolina.
Yea and trump did nothing to stop, contain the virus. 150,000 plus dead!!!!
Thanks so much. I have donated to Dem causes and candidates and have spoken out against hate of all kinds, especially the hate promoted by Trump. But gosh, I'm done. Maybe Trump is right. I think people start out good but turn bad. 15 and 16 year olds have no idea. I'm done.
Honestly, I‚Äôm upset by the idea that Covid-19 is being blamed as the reason that Trump may likely lose. He was a failed president long before we were hit with a global pandemic.
I think we can assure Trump is safe because he is the only one who matters, to him. That may be the only safe assurance. Probably is.
Do you think Trump writes off the expense he pays for hairspray as President? He likes hairspray in a way that most men will never understand. I hope he‚Äôs buying bulk at Costco.

I can‚Äôt believe why people are wondering why Trump wasn‚Äôt at the funeral today 1. Nobody wanted him there 2. Nobody wants a campaign rally had a funeral 3. He are we says stupid things. 4. Nobody likes him that would be there
Wrong.I hate and condemn Nazis. Stupid people get sucked into horrific things. I think Americans are good people but so many are being sucked into Trump's web of deceit and hate and I see many similarities between Trump and Hitler. And I hate that. Not an apologist at all.
This should be obvious, but there's nothing noble or admirable about not being able to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Even the 99% of GOPers who support the president and fascism don't engage in this peculiar form of political idiocy.
While Trump blames Senate Democrats for obstruction (false), The  adjourns the Senate for a long (3.5 day) weekend instead of continuing to work on relief.
After watchind the impeachment debacle of Trump in the House, I can't believe you people are talking about anything fair. That was the worst kangaroo court I've ever seen! Looks like your planning the same for Barr. Why waist time? Go ahead and vote! You got the partisan votes!

That is Not what I think. I think that everyone who still backs Trump is All In. But there were Republicans who are still Republicans yet hate what their party has become. That‚Äôs why I left it in 2005.
trump: i'm gonna do some fascist shit  liberals: tut tut he can't do that  trump: *does it*
I don‚Äôt even know what you mean. If you saw my timeline, you would know I‚Äôm not complacent about Trump. I have been raising alarm for years. I don‚Äôt want another Nazi Germany. My dad and 4 uncles fought the Nazis. That‚Äôs where we are headed if Trump has his way.
Trump vs Biden 2020. What if a third party candidate could win? Especially if they owned the middle ground middle class American with all cabinet positions released before the election.  What an experience that‚Äôd be for our political system, a true American that sees both sides.
But .... NASDAQ is highest ever and DOW has set records under Trump administration! Ugg. Trump still does not understand the virus must be controlled before economy can truly recover. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúleadership‚Äù is killing us, businesss and in turn, the economy.
Wont happen Trump will win in the biggest landslide
Trump met with Vanessa Guillen's family and clearly hadn't bothered to learn much about the case beforehand.  So heres a reminder about what Trump had to say about sexual assault and violence against women in the military in the past:
New York Federal Judge orders the Trump administration to stop enforcing the #PublicChargeRule during the pandemic.
She has quietly advocated for mask wearing for some time now. Problem is she‚Äôs usually with Trump and can‚Äôt say it very forcefully. Look where that got Dr. Fauci.
Ok, so guy gets a pardon for bilking Medicaid AND his company Kodak gets a government loan to become a drug maker?  What did he do for Trump?  What did he do? Must be something pretty big.
I really wish that all the 'pearl-clutchers' in the crowd would quit fretting about Trump changing the date of the election. This also applies to getting him out of the WH after the new Prez is sworn in.   The new Prez can have Trump tossed out on his ass by marshals.
Obama is a criminal that spied on Trump campaign  He also spied on Americans He also hated the Police Got 5 Dallas Policemen killed Let the FBI run rouge  and the NSA  He may go to jail
Maybe Democratic party should drop out of the race and endorse a third party if they are so afraid of Trump winning because of them.
Because Trump was right
Y‚Äôall know trump isn‚Äôt leaving, right? Like there‚Äôs zero chance he‚Äôll leave and no one will stop him.
Once out of office, Trump will be of no use to Putin or any country, for that matter. Why would another country take him and his grifting family? I think he will find that his "friends" are all truly FAKE and they will drop him like a hot potato. Even GOP will turn on him.
Pres Trump uses his name on his tweets so if you want to call someone a coward just look at the handle you have on your tweet.
I don't think Trump's Russian handler will allow him to resign so soon after losing the election. He still has work to do for his Mother Country. That is what keeps me awake at night, in addition to other worries about how he can destroy US.
THIS IS SURREAL WATCH!!!President Trump will ‚Äòlead America back to God,‚Äô according to 1983 prophecy  via
The new Prez should have Trump passports revoked.  Trump has an airliner. Maybe have FAA ground the thing...
I‚Äôve got my popcorn WAITING for that debate. Trump will eat him alive. It‚Äôs a lose/lose for you. If Biden debates, Trump makes a fool of him. If he doesn‚Äôt, Trump still wins. Please, continue to stay ‚Äúwoke‚Äù though. üòÜ
You just described trump.
I have now! We needed this, especially today. I'm in the middle of a bright red neighborhood in a bright red state (OK).  I have yet to see any Trump signs (yea) but also have yet to see any Biden signs. I'm sure when we get our Biden sign it will be vandalized.
That's my fear too. We saw what a simple LIBERATE tweet did in Michigan; it brought out the pretend militia members dressed in full combat gear. Trump can encourage even more violence and would have no qualms doing so. He would love to have a war fought over Him.
Obama is giving the eulogy at Lewis's funeral and god forbid Trump not be at the center of attention... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¨

Trump can't do shit when it comes to changing the date of the election.   Full. Fucking. Stop.
Literally no trump supporters in the comments they know this is wrong.
Unfortunately, many people voted for Trump because he said things many were thinking but couldn't say out loud. But generally I agree with your statement.
So trump is getting the blame for this death too? A grown man who decided on his own not to wear the mask who on his own decided to attend?? How about people start taking responsibility for their own actions
Trump is so psychotic he listens to WTF just for Maron's monologues
All this time, folks suspected Donald Trump to be a Russian asset. Who would have guessed, he's actually a Democratic asset queuing up a #PresidentPelosi?  Seriously though, read this if you want to understand the nuance of election timing hypotheticals:

Israel named a town after Donald Trump. Talk about an incompetent Nazi!
Absent one notable exception. Of course, Trump would make it all about him and would just disrupt the funeral. It's a time of sharing love, not hate. Just sad that the President of the United States doesn't have the ability to even try to say a kind thing about Rep. Lewis.
Fake News! Don't believe a thing you read about COVID-19. It's a hoax! Easily remedied by a cocktail of Trump's favorite "cure" and Demon seed and Alien sperm, prescribed by Trump's new favorite doc. Seriously, this is not good. Trump has to go. NOW.

Driving around waving at hard working Americans is awesome. Sorry  for driving by so many times. I just know you have president Trumps cell number. I‚Äôd like to lead us into 2024 and allow Trump to retire as a great president that took on the crooked media.
Trump virus killed Herman Cain!
Yes. Not sure why today feels different. Maybe it was waking up to breaking news that Trump considering postponing the election. Now Herman Cain dies from COVID. Trump Militia going into more cities. Pompeo testifying. HOW MUCH MORE CAN THIS COUNTRY TAKE AND STILL SURVIVE?
Re-upping this photo of Gov Stitt sitting within two feet of Herman Cain‚Äîboth without masks‚Äîat Trump's Tulsa rally.  Both Stitt and Cain tested positive for coronavirus after the rally. Now one of them is dead.  Are you ready to take this seriously yet,
If only he had went to a protest instead of a Trump rally he would have been immune. The first thing I thought was that he was murdered by dems to try and prove a point. Wouldn't be to far fetched to believe a dem operative purposely gave him the virus.
This man literally died for Trump
GOOD LORD! TRUMP CANNOT DELAY THE ELECTION!!
Really that has nothing to do with the 1st amendment. Lmao she is a politician he is a constituent, she can't block him. End of story. Trump hasn't been the only politician/police department that has lost these cases.
Maybe learn the constitution.
You can bet if, somehow, polls go in Trump's favor by November, he will enthusiastically express support for the election and its results.
But predicting that our Constitution _will_ fall apart in November can really only do two things: help it along the way to falling apart or play into the focus of Trump's campaign  ("vote for me 'cause things are falling apart").
Freaking out about election cancelation / failure only feeds Trump's narrative. Cut it the fuck out!
There are no "just Trump" failures. His party could have stopped any of this. Instead they support him in everything. Romney's lone vote on impeachment is a pretty good metric of the percentage of the GOP willing to stand up to Trump. This is ALL on the Republican Party.
Trump's call to delay the election is exactly as serious as his demand that Clinton be locked up or that "Obamagate" be the focus of national attention. It's nonsense. It cannot happen. But, yeah, we should be disturbed as hell that he'd say it.
Shocked to see Rush Limbaugh point out his use of conspiracies. ‚ÄúTrump never says that he believes these conspiracy theories that he touts. He‚Äôs simply passing them on.‚Äù What?
This. The more outrageous the Tweet the more likely Trump doesn‚Äôt want  *his followers* to see bad news elsewhere.  Truth Sandwich:  ‚ÄúThe election date is in the constitution Obliterating Obama‚Äôs economic recovery was not Trump thinks he can fool you again.‚Äù
Reason to believe?? My GOD!! The alternative is TRUMP! There‚Äôs your reason!
This is all part of the Democrat strategy to take down not only Trump but all coservatives too. Dems are in bed with global socialists. They are well financed and organized. A formidable enemy! They're not going to stop! We are at war!
Oh hell, once a new Prez is sworn, (s)he is the CiC and can have Secret Service or US Marshals toss Trump out on his fat ass.

Disagree LuAnn. There is a strategic reason we have allies. Nobody does well standing alone in the world, but that's where Trump is taking us. I stand with Mitt, a beacon of hope in a sea of Trump puppets.
Something MUST be noted:  Prior to Trump's escapades, Mental Health professionals (as a professional standard) would refuse to "remote diagnose".    It just was not done.  Now, it is commonplace in Trump's case. WHY AREN'T WE LISTENING????

This election has ramifications for the world.  In 4 years Putin could invade multiple countries, start WW III, and trump would sit back and let him.
We are on the brink of a civil war now. Pres. Trump has shown great restraint or we would be in one now! I don't want a civil war. It would devastate our great nation!
The most blatant example of how systemic racism in the United States thrives. With trump, it‚Äôs just out in the open.
There is still plenty of time for Trump to change and capture the majority of voters. Yeah, I know that sounds uninformed and ignorant but something could happen that gives Trump the edge.
From a guy who covered Tiananmen.
Aww, Trump is a mean business man. The Chicoms don't like him either. You're in bad company!
I'm so glad you feel supported. And you are right; Trump brought a whole lot of good people together. I hope the Twitter relationships continue because it has been so nice. Good luck with the packing.
MJF out on here looking like Trump lol #AEW #AEWDynamite
Thank you for speaking up. I, too, have lost friendships over Trump. I keep saying he's not worth it but gosh, words get "said" and pretty soon, not even talking. I really don't understand how they don't see what we see.  GOP left me in 2005. I am sad, yet free and at peace.
Trump tweeted that our lovely suburbs are safe now that he has ordered no low-income housing in the suburbs. He promises property values will go up. The Russian bounty issue has not made it to his desk yet but many say it's fake news anyway. Louis Gohmert has COVID. Ugggggg.
Germany is home to the US military's largest overseas hospital. If a military member is severely hurt while deployed, it's Germany they're evacuated to.  Now Trump wants to pull a third of troops stationed there to "punish" Germany‚Äîbut it's American service members he's hurting.
They'd rather people die than take something Trump recommended or that would compete with Gilead's (barely tested) remdesivir.  Trump should issue an EO to make HCQ over-the-counter.
"We need a president who will bring us together instead of tearing us apart and who will enforce the law faithfully rather than put his own political interests first." Which is precisely why Donald Trump gets my vote on November 3rd.
Still, regard Trump's tweet here as a precursor to what he'll be tweeting on Election night.
you met my mom on the trial, she passed away last night from Covid, something that trump could have prevented from happening.
Thank you, Donald Trump! He signed it, right Bernie?
I am by all means saying Trump would be a better choice. Not to be rude, but how can you think a Democratic President will be anything less than catastrophic. We can‚Äôt afford it, or tolerate it!

Of course  did.  He threw out his own reopening guidelines when they suggested going back and losing Trump's Tulsa rally, saying "We'll just have to learn to live with (#coronavirus)!"
Like I said, *someone* is making a helluva lot of money off the Trump-Kodak largess.  Now it looks like insider trading also occurred.
There's plenty of casinos that are not making money right now. Everyone including you wishes that they could "fail" in business as Trump did. We'd all be "failed" billionairs! Right?

The AFFH also requires that states and localities track how much of their housing is accessible to disabled people.  Once again, Trump's racism also has the byproduct of hurting the disability community, putting disabled PoC at particular risk.

Invading the states? You don't have a clue as to what an invasion is. Trump has shown remarkable restraint by not sending in the military to squash this rebellion! He's been sworn to defend federal entities and to uphold the constitution for all!
I'm not desperate. It's obvious that the Dems are. They are accusing Bar and then not allowing him to talk. They did the same thing to Trump. Trump refused to participate in the sham. Why don't you Dems just have a vote to impeach Barr without the sham inquiry? You got the votes!
Someone's making a lot of money thanks to Trump's largess to Kodak, and it's not the people out of work due to COVID.
One would think that they both should run away from the toxic waste dump that is Trump and his minions.
Yes, let‚Äôs have a debate on which candidate speaks better, you really want Joe Biden here? I think it‚Äôs extremely problematic that Biden doesn‚Äôt know where he is a lot of times, forgets questions &amp; his train of thought. I also don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ever watched a single trump speech
Hey, its the guy that single-handily demolished the United States Senate.  I think I will pass. I always tune out greedy, power-hungry, Trump enablers.  He needs to be voted out of office in November.

Will the media still report on Trump everyday after he is no longer president?

Think maybe the knuckleheads got together and planned that strategy? Ever seen a more angry, rude, indignant collection of people? Trump picked up a few undecideds yesterday no doubt.

My mom died tonight from the virus... I‚Äôm having a real hard time. Fuck trump and fuck American health care
So what are you talking about? We're seeing a coordinated effort to destroy our nation. Do you think any pres. would stand by and allow that to continue unoppsed? Pres. Trump has shown remarkable restraint. He's hoping that the mayors and governors will begin to protect their own
She is like trump with name calling except trump names are good nothing about nancy is good, funny or important
Well, this won't end in a disaster. Kidding. Everything Trump does becomes a disaster and we pay for those.
Glen knows Trump is our Pres. and can do his job as the Pres. of the United States. Which includes enforcing our constitutional rights, our right to life and the pursuit of happiness (protection from terrorists)! Right?
I have been calling him William dis-Barr for months. He is not an Attorney General. He is Trump's personal attorney and the bar association should investigate him.
Watching  about Alex Jones, and I‚Äôm so disgusted. He and his followers of Info Wars, are exactly who got Trump elected.  So gross. All of them. And Roger Stone.
He's not Trump's Attorney General. He's the Attorney General of the United States! He's being attacked by despicable Democrats for upholding the law! They will fail to remove him, just like they failed with Trump!
This is who our president thinks is an important voice. "Doctors make DNA from aliens"
They are so desperate to beat Trump
Wrong! They are sworn to defend our constitution. That means to defend our right to life and the pursuit of happiness. Pres. Trump has every right to send in the military, if he deams it necessary. He does not have to put up with anarchy!
Even Trump says it should be left to the states.
Somebody got to Trump after the briefing before tonight. I suspect Laura I on FOX because she continued to promote after Trump had dropped the issue.
This isn‚Äôt the ideal answer, but it‚Äôs the honest truth. The post popular thing about Biden‚Äîamong lifelong ardent progressives &amp; evangelical conservatives alike‚Äîis that he is the opposite of Trump.
The Devil will be surprised when he tries to collect Trump's "soul."
Trump is the best across all boards.. you need some get right!
Trump says he's going to veto it.    Will you vote to override if he does?
I have the same fear  US is like a volcano with all of the hot lava bubbling right below the surface, getting ready to erupt. Instead of calm, the Trump administration is just turning up the heat so Trump dream of a war being waged Over Him comes to fruition. Scary.
I will readily state that I am NOT a big fan of using COVID-19 "assistance" dollars to build a new FBI building, build F-35 fighters and replace the BILLIONS Trump stole from Defence to build his Vanity Wall.  Spend the money needed...but do it wisely.
"Trump tower was actually about Maginsky and adoptions"
A Trump administration mandate will now give Oklahoma‚Äôs nursing homes greater access to #COVID19 rapid tests, helping a hard hit community.  However this lessens public access to testing, and could be counterproductive in curbing the pandemic.
They don't want to hear reasonable responses. They just want to pontificate. They hate Trump and are willing to let cities burn.
Just one more prime example of Trump's inherent inability to recognize expertise and talent. This defect in Trump is why his current cabinet looks like they escaped from a clown car in ring #3.
*Sends in feds to keep anarchists from burning down city   ‚ÄúTrump is only protecting his base‚Äù üòÇ
You and Trump appear to be the only ones confused on VP Biden's position on police defunding. Spreading misinformation is NOT PATRIOTIC.
I mean I (generally) like Trump but I also have a sense of humor, people need to grow tf up
But all y‚Äôall sheep made jokes about Trump saying hydroxychloroquine works for Covid, look at it now! Haha do y‚Äôall ever get tired of getting proven wrong by this man? Shit I know that‚Äôs gotta be exhausting seeing him keep winning üòÇ
Democratic MO not allow Barr to answer... that‚Äôs not a hearing this is  harrassing the attorney general! Vote Trump 2020 to continue fighting for the corruption of democrats like swalwell, pelosi, schiff, Nadler, Schumer, chicken Cohen, lofgren, Johnson,...
Trump-Lite
It's a good thing NY &amp; NJ ignored Trump's recommendations early on and kept their mortality rates so low, especially in nursing homes.  Oh, wait...
Now if only Facebook and Twitter would delete more of his shit more often, that would be great.
The Trump campaign is one huge #grift.  #Kleptocracy
We need to remember the great job President Trump is doing and üëÄ at all the BIG NAMES!  Massive pedophile ring busted; 230 kids saved - Crime &amp; courts
Trump pro nuclear energy? Where‚Äôs it at then?
2 choices?  How about just not voting?  Why be an accessory to US government misdeeds?   You know there's going to me more war and innocent deaths, regardless of who gets in there.  Don't blame me for Trump. I didn't vote.
If they‚Äôre for trump , there is for no thinking going on!
Can't even stand to look at Barr's face; he makes me so angry with how blatantly he doesn't care about anything but enacting Trump's lawlessness agenda.
Drug manufacturers can't make their billions of dollars on a cheap drug that works! China unleashed this to get rid of Trump, who is forcing them to treat us fairly in trade. They want our economy ruined. The media is totally controlled by the Democrats.
You little communist Trump haters are trying your best to force communism on our country. It won't work here. Even with all the media in your pocket, the House, and sports against us and Trump, we're still winning. We will never be communist ever!!!! Move to Venezuela.
It‚Äôs gonna be President Trump‚Äôs greatest legacy in his EIGHT YEARS in the White House! Steve Bannon knows!
Another point was made about the situation in #Portland. One can hold two opinions:  1) Trump sending in numerous federal agents and cracking down hard only escalates the situation.  2) Most protesters are peaceful, but those that are rioting and attacking agents are wrong.
I‚Äôd bet on trump over biden getting the ball to the plate .

Dr. Fauci reading Trump's tweets this morning:
Seems Trump and his conspiracy-loving supporters are back to pushing the ‚Äúmagic cure‚Äù once more.
Hydroxychloroquine now being touted by more and more doctors as a significant drug in successfully treating COVID-19. Will any guests speak to the lives lost all because Trump haters immediately rejected  the drug, only because Pres Trump mentioned it as a possible remedy?

Donald trump and omarosa
It has been exasperating at how many ‚Äúrespected‚Äù journalists keep trying to normalize Trump as if he were a pecking chicken who picked the right weather forcast once out of 50 times at one of those state fair booths. ‚ÄúLook‚Äù, they cry, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a miracle! The chicken got it right!‚Äù.
They need to. They didn‚Äôt ask for this. There are enough cities with unpaid bills from previous Trump rallies that should make any city think twice about inviting him, yet Stitt invited Trump. Trump and Elon already had it agreed that Tesla would go to Austin. Trump lied to Stitt
Yep! and is also a vote for Trump.
this is AMERICA where i only respect BLUE LIVES and i give my child CHEMICALS and masks are just CONTROLLING DEVICES and trump LOVES us and jeff bezos DESERVES his fortune just like i DESERVE the discounts at GOLDEN CORRAL
Two months of protesting and violence in Portland Joe. Was going on there way before Trump sent in help to protect Federal buildings.  Violence in Seattle, Minneapolis, DC, NYC and now Austin. You just now figuring that out? You act like this is a new revelation.
3. The Trump Admin sank MILLIONS into buying up HCQ.  So, fuck ya they want you to demand it and doctors to prescribe it so they can cash in on their purchases!
Could the difference be Trump is an actual motherf***ker, whereas AOC is not a f***ingbitch? Yep, that's it.
...and as a Trump, you would be very familiar with betrayal of the American people.
I just cannot take this woman seriously (the Dr. in the video).  She looks like she's performing, not giving sound, scientifically-driven medical advice. Also, the Trump Admin spent MILLIONS and MILLIONS on HCQ. So of course they want to peddle it now so they can MAKE THAT MONEY.
Lol the enlighten centrist will really show the tankies what's up. Keep fighting the good fight dude. Feel free to send that kind of appreciation toward the Trump cult as well. You'll be just as successful.
Your Trump voodoo doll is hiding. That's appropriate. hehehaha.
Where did you find your Trump doll? By the way, I liked your prayer for your pins. Sounds like your pins are hoping Trump has a period of retrospection and regret. I'm afraid I would my pins differently to relive my stress. Never thought a Voodoo Doll could be a Prayer Doll.
Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.
I wonder if someplace sells Trump Voodoo dolls? If not, someone ought to jump on that little gem QUIKLY! I'l buy one and also a few for my friends. Brilliant idea  !
Nah. If Mexico paid for a wall instead of Trump administration, which contracted with Trump donors with no Wall experience, the wall would have not been knocked down by wind. Or was it the Trump Donor's Wall that blew down? Either way, God made the wind solely to embarrass Trump.
But he hasn‚Äôt done it has he genius? Why don‚Äôt you direct your concern to what is ACTUALLY happening instead what Trump said? We have Democrat ‚Äúprotestors‚Äù burning up cities run by Democrat mayors and they‚Äôre Given a pass by msm, dem politicians, &amp; probably you. Incredible.
Probably because Trump does not want another endless war with Iran - which would NEVER surrender to US no matter how many of them we kill.
Has Trump said a word about Herman Cain? Silence is some weird kind of Thank You for taking one for the team.
Yep, the old "mom scam", then there's the "dad scam," the "fed-up grandparents' scam," and don't forget the  "veterans' scam"...Rex Tillerson nailed it when he said Trump was a (  word my mother does not approve of  ) moron.
Of course they didn't discuss it because Trump is afraid of Putin and would never stand up to him. If he does, his Russia-originated loans will be called and then even his cult will have to acknowledge Trump is compromised. Not that it will matter to them. He will yell FAKE NEWS
Not illegal or ridiculous and it‚Äôs only unfair in your eyes. Many of us who participate in the ‚Äútrending‚Äù activity are fed up with your lies, corruption, abuses of power ad infinity. The trends are a way of expressing our frustration and disapproval. You‚Äôre a failure, Mr. Trump!
Have you been waiting to get into the United States on a B-1 or B-2 #visitorvisa? Now that the #US Consulates are opening up around the world you can apply for either visitor visa.
Biden should say "No taxes, no debate."    Would refocus on Trump's corruption.
SAME i took a survey for how trump was doing to bash him and i answered everything negatively and i got an email saying ‚Äúwelcome to the trump team!‚Äù Like NO
Better start looking at home. The first place is the White House starting with Trump. Nazis, KKK, and talking orders from Putin. Can‚Äôt wait to your next election. Because you lie for Trump you are as guilty as if you broke the law yourself.
With numbers not going to CDC first but WH the numbers are filtered out. Like Oklahomans numbers for week saying technical issues when we started reporting to WH. Red State Governors are coveting Trump‚Äôs ass.
‚ÄúFit my narrative‚Äù. Good one. If anyone knows anything about ‚Äúfitting narratives‚Äù it‚Äôs Trump supporters. The good news for you is, even if I provided solid evidence you wouldn‚Äôt believe me anyway.
Happy Monday to everyone except Donald Trump whose border wall is an abomination.
‚ÄúAnti-racist‚Äù ideology is a race driven ideology. Explicitly and admittedly. It uses that racist ideology to justify discrimination. Ask Kendi. That is the a to fascism. Trump is driven by Trump. Not by a racist ideology.
Not only are they supposed to stay home, but the Trump Virus is out of control in US because of Trump administration's failed COVID19 response. Innocent Americans who have lost jobs, homes and businesses, not to mention loved ones. Trump created this mess; he must make it right.
Could you imagine if the tables were turned, and Trump made that comment? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That‚Äôs not racist, that‚Äôs people making fun of Biden‚Äôs absurd comment to the black community: ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote for Trump....I mean, what kind of crap is that???
Has she smiled in public once since Trump was elected?
Perhaps one for  with Inhofe parroting Trump...
It seems like Trump's reelection plan has become a hundred little Reichstag fires.
If Trump (or Barr) announced he was no longer pursuing Assange, Trump would instantly be accused of aiding the Russians and probably lose the election.  So yes, there is a political angle here, whether it is the AG "using Assange for political ends" or Trump's political enemies.
Any suppression of individual thought and freedom of speech by trying homogenize language and thought is fascism by definition. Trump has done none of that. You and the left are literally preaching it as virtue.
Exactly. We by definition do not have a fascist government even with trump in the presidency. We do have woke, ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù fascists of ‚Äúripping down‚Äù our institutionally democratic (non-fascist) government and replacing it with their fascist regressive ideology.
Trump's views of "suburban housewives" seems rooted in the 1950's, where racism was prevalent.  He's using that outdated fear of "bad hombres" to try to win them back, and it's not working.
Hey, Joe [or rather his shill who composed it], complete the true thought:  "In 100 days, we‚Äôre going to make Donald Trump a one-term president by skullduggery, intimidation, voter fraud, and murder, if we have to."
Along with the financial impacts of Trump's impetuous decisions, there are political ones.  ‚ÄúIf Joe Biden wins North Carolina, Trump gets his ass kicked all across the country,‚Äù one state Republican official told NBC News.
Yes when local governments don‚Äôt want them coming in. Do you remember the civil war? Read history friend. And this.
That‚Äôs just untrue. Again, you got rebuffed on every point from the beginning of this conversation and the ONLY thing you can do in return is bash an easily target like trump. In summary The 1619 project propaganda for a fascist ideology that you believe in. That simple.
You‚Äôre using a definition that has been changed just like your definition of racism. Either way, every time you get caught on a point you never respond. Now you default to trump bashing because you can‚Äôt respond with facts. When that doesn‚Äôt work you imply racism.
By the way, if you look up the real definition of fascism and not the SJW version of it (yup they changed that definition too, which is a sign of fascism) you will see its meaning has more in common with ‚Äúanti-racism‚Äù than anything Trump has done.
Suddenly Trump‚Äôs handwriting makes sense ...
I see they purchased bleach. Hopefully that‚Äôs for their Trump-recommended IV drip. Idiots usually take care of themselves.
Lady, the liberal media ran with a story about Russian prostitutes urinating on a bed Obama slept in before Trump was even inaugurated, and the stories have only gotten more bizarre. I think you should sit this one out.
LET's BE CLEAR !!!  Pork Producers need a bail-out because China stopped buying their product.  This is a result of Trump's failed trade policies.  NOT COVID-19.
Trump has built more new wall around the White House than he has at the US-Mexico border.  Was this what #MAGA was wanting when he said #BuildTheWall?
It's Trump's fault
Mr. Bolen,  Many seniors have trouble with fine motor skills due to aging or age related conditions. Tweeting a meme like this one puts you in the Trump category of mocking the disabled, or in this case, elders. SMH
A TOTALLY different set of rules has applied to Trump's gangland Crew.
Really, because I'm sure Mary Trump's book followed closely by Bolton's is much, much more important than yours...or that's what 1 million readers are saying.
Maybe, like many seniors, his advisors need to SPEAK LOUDLY. As narcissistic as Trump is, hearing aids would be out of the question.
They follow Trump in the same way 918 people followed Jim Jones to Jonestown in Guyana and drank his cyanide koolaid. They have become a conspiracy theory believing cult.
'Try harder' are the operative words. Trump is LAZY. Period.
An out of control pandemic, a stock market artificially propped up, explosive racial issues, storm troopers on the streets of American cities, Russia paying bounties on our servicemen, illegal payoffs to porn stars (oh, and wishing a sex trafficker well). You &amp; Trump own it all.
I wouldn't rule it out...  Each speaks DIRECTLY to a segment of Trump's Core that he NEEDS to retain.
üö®Why Lisa Page's Tweet About the FBI, Trump, and 'Generational Harm' Is Beyond Rich! üçøüòè
Apropos for Trump. All "has-beens"...
So trump is a dictator because he‚Äôs defending federal property from being burned down?
I grew up going to church. I have the same Bible I had as a kid. Trump does not go to church. I doubt that he even knows how to pray. I doubt that he ever asks God for guidance. I am not an evangelical. Just a regular person who knows that God is always in my life.
Trump has no plan for the country after the election. He doesn't give a damn about anyone except his base. First president in my lifetime who can't tell me what  he will do after the election.
JFK as a redhead? He would never be in the same room as Trump.
Wow I just got hit with a Biden ad and then a Trump ad on the same YouTube video.Nah we love trump he‚Äôs shook up Washington and we are ready to do it 4 more years
Trump really one step ahead f them

If they just mail out ballots to everyone, I think Trump will get all his redneck minions to steal them and fill all them out straight Republican.   Aren't you scared Trump will cheat?  That's why we need vote in person with ID. So Trump can't cheat.
The trump playbook says to create your own reality. Congrats! You are doing EXACTLY what trump would do...LIE AND LIE AND LIE! This explains why you‚Äôve been designated one of the MOST DANGEROUS GOVERNORS IN AMERICA! Resign! NOW! You are a CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER! #babytrump
If you spent just 15 minutes doing your own research (not bullshit biased media sources like nytimes, Washington post, cbs, or CNN) you would realize that Trump has done a lot more good than harm for this country
Trump could literally bring world peace and people would still criticize him. I find it unbelievable that y‚Äôall are so fixed on this bullshit narrative that Trump is the fucking antichrist. Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where he is/who he is.
Wont happen Trump will win in the biggest landslide
Obama is a criminal that spied on Trump campaign  He also spied on Americans He also hated the Police Got 5 Dallas Policemen killed Let the FBI run rouge  and the NSA  He may go to jail
Because Trump was right
Everytime trump has bad news about him, he tweets something to distract. He KNOWS the media (you) will follow him wherever he takes you. He has played you and the media from day one. Rachael Maddow said it best-watch what they do NOT what they say.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
making sure trump knows our democracy will not be deterred or delayed #WeWillVote
This man literally died for Trump
GOOD LORD! TRUMP CANNOT DELAY THE ELECTION!!
Reason to believe?? My GOD!! The alternative is TRUMP! There‚Äôs your reason!
No. No. No. NO. NO. NO!!!!!!!  Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
The most blatant example of how systemic racism in the United States thrives. With trump, it‚Äôs just out in the open.
This is not the time or the way to fight the "Trump Lite" nickname...
We need Trump to drain the swamp and you know it's the only way it'll ever happen.
Trump is also a creepy old radical.

Question, if you hate Trump so much, why do you follow him and respond to his tweets on Twitter?

No, we are blaming to politicians that refuse to reinstate law and order, regardless of what their political affiliation. However, I know it wasn‚Äôt Republicans rioting because Trump won the election. (I just had to throw that in, sorry)

While running errands today daughter says I really hate Trump! When I asked her why, she responds becuz he‚Äôs not even a  good enough president to be on our dollars!!  Love the simplicity in a 6 yr old.
Pretty sure the ‚Äúnot political‚Äù part is wishing someone with opposing political viewpoints to get well. I‚Äôm sure he didn‚Äôt suddenly start supporting Trump or Republicans. He didn‚Äôt even speak to HC‚Äôa character. He just wished another human a complete recovery &amp; to get well.
TRUMP SHRUNK!
They believe wearing a mask is ANTI_TRUMP!
Trump supporter like comedy too
If this person hadn‚Äôt retweeted &amp; then blocked me...I might remind him of the 2016 celebrity line up...&amp; Trump still won because only stupid people would vote based off who a celebrity supports.
Because of what celebrities support Trump?üòÇ Why would anyone base their vote on what a musician , actor, actress, or any other type of entertainer thinks?
If Trump wins in 2020, there won't be a United States left in 2024. The people ( well, except for the crazies who wouldn't know crap from chocolate) are beginning to wise up to this snake-oil salesman. I would, as a Republican, rather have Joe Biden than Cadet Bonespurs in office
State of shock was clever &amp; funny. Still voting Trump.

I don‚Äôt care what Donald trump has done for the economy!! Because the emotional turmoil he has caused or instigated is unjustified !!!

You‚Äôre right. Career politicians had everything under control until Trump was voted into office &amp; then suddenly everything went wrong.
There is a rumor that contractors attacking peaceful MOMMAS in Pittsburg were shouting commands in RUSSIAN! Did the military contracting companies supply TRUMP with foreign mercenaries?
I think I might be a suburban momü§î... I think I‚Äôll vote for Trump BECAUSE of his rhetoric.  ...&amp; also I don‚Äôt want my town turned into Portland...
I'd be more impressed if TRUMP offered proof he could change his own diapers!

If we test people and the hospital get full I hope that would be good. If we stop who knows how many would spread this around. So Trump is right the more testing we do the more hospitals get full.

I‚Äôd love to be voting for a black president right not, but not if they are not educated. That‚Äôs like voting another trump in. Ain‚Äôt happening
The most stupidest comment I‚Äôve ever seen. Yes Biden hasn‚Äôt done anything for African Americans but I‚Äôd rather him than trump anyday. Hes our only option. I sure ain‚Äôt voting for no one who is late in the race, unstable, And don‚Äôt know a lick about politics just bc he‚Äôs black.
