This is such a mistake to do right before election. It just gives Trump a talking point and takes votes away from Joe Biden. Bad timing.
Joe Biden is getting distracted from his  obsession.

Team Obama, team Biden, whatever team it is, I'm in as long as it means #VoteTrumpOut
Did you read Nate Cohan’s breakdown about recent polls? Apparently there has been a lack of high-quality polling the last few weeks and less reliable polls (Rasmussen) are pulling down Biden slightly.
BIDEN’S AMERICA! 🇺🇸 NEVER FORGET - coming to a town near you. 🇺🇸
I have family in Michigan that didn't go vote in 2016,  thanks to misinformation.  They know better and will stand on line for days to vote for Biden.
I love how these idiot Trump supporters love to believe the victims when it comes to Biden and Clinton but conveniently ignore the victims when it’s Trump.
Im seeing a lot of people's takeaway from this thread is that voting doesn't matter, and that Biden is the same as Trump. I hope people can realize the trickle-down impact that the policies set by the government in charge have on everyone. Things like supreme Court justices.
Johnny, these are sad days for me. I'm having to take down my Obama stuff because I know he didn't move the needle enough. I love him and Michelle and they didn't move the needle enough. They inherited a mess and they didn't move the needle enough. It sucks but true. Never Biden!
Jassica Talov what has Joe Biden done for the African American and for all people in 50 yrs in congress give me one thing , 8yrs as Vice President , you want me to tell you , nada you no what that means ? President Trump as done more in 3 yrs than all dmocrats in office..
They haven't been any of those things for YEARS.  Clinton cleaned up the Reagan/Bush mess, Obama cleaned up Bush's mess, and Biden will have to clean up Trump's. How many times will Americans be fooled by these con men?
Hey   Trying to dissuade African American voters from voting for Joe Biden to vote for Trump is like asking them to return to a Jim Crow America.  Because that’s what a second Trump term would look like.  Not gonna happen.
Team Obama = Team Biden = Team Sanity = Team America!!
NO! THIS CAN'T BE!  SOCIOPATH SAYS BIDEN HATES GOD!!!  AND SOCIOPATH HASN'T BEEN WRONG YET, HAS HE?!?  👿👿👿PRES. SOCIOPATH RULES ! ! !👿👿👿 (OR DOES HE ? ! ?)
The first thing that struck me, of course in comparison to the malignant narcissist in chief, was how Biden listened. I don’t recall tRump listening in any way that wasn’t just to calculate how he was going to either kill the messenger or soak up adoration and use it to boast.
Joe Biden needs to take this VP nonsense out back and shoot it like a lame goddamn horse, pick *someone* and stop the mini-primary infighting and bitterness we got over the primary we don't need a second primary to get over before the election.
Meghan McCain bashes Daily Beast for headline suggesting she could vote for Trump over Biden  #FoxNews- First &amp; foremost it’s call freedom of choice &amp; speech. Besides it’s none of our business who Megan votes for this election.
I get it. Biden can call Trump the most racist president ever but Trump can't say anything about Biden. Makes sense
I feel like, much like Biden’s own nomination, it’ll be Kamala and was always Kamala and it will feel very anti climactic because that’s who was always ahead in the odds.  And then both right and left will tear her down to the bones and take no responsibility for the consequences
What did China give the Biden’s to deserve ALL the money China paid them?
Funny he still won in 2016. He doesn't take black votes for granted like Biden yet has done more for the black community than Biden has in 40 years.
I agree people shouldn’t be complacent.   But I also think Biden will get 70,000,000 votes.
Honestly what’s worse? 4 more of Trump, or 8 of Biden?
I could not afford the annulment and again I still receive. My parish is St. Joseph’s in Portland, Maine. If any canon law  Catholics want to tell on me. As far as abortion, I understand want you are saying however I am still with Biden. I could go on but I

Well, they're not letting Biden out of his crypt to do any debates, so...
Imagine a debate -  Trump will stomp him out with Crime Bill   How will Biden ever defend that  . He can’t.   He’s gonna lose and 4 more years of the worst pres in history . Thanks DNC. Only #Bernie could hv stopped this horror of Trump
Biden is against Gods  commandment, thou shall not kill. He and Pelosi and Democrats who voted for infanticide are Catholic in name only.
Trump is the only evil here. Let’s be clear. Biden is not evil. Is he the candidate I wanted? No. Do I always get what I want? No. Is there something more important than what I want? Uh yes, the future of the country.  The choice is never been easier.
Why Trump – Not Biden – Might Have An Enthusiasm Problem –
Right-wing Biden attacks fizzle –
Biden's position on abortion is being debated on-line  People are weighing-in saying Catholic family members, nuns, etc. can be pro-choice  Please be unequivocal about this  Many souls are being lost
Today, we will see if Obama dead enders are in control of the Biden candidacy.
i see a direct correlation between TikTok users punking him in Tulsa and him saying Biden hurt god. #TraitorTrump
Joe Biden doesn’t write any of his tweets
Joe Biden is this way
He's unimportant.  Anyone that votes for him had no intention of supporting Biden.
Btw, saying that when a cartoon points out racism as a bad thing it isn't TERRORISM... isn't supporting Joe Biden
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
I understand that voting Biden in is not going to change a lot right off the bat but lemme tell you how nice it would be if me and my friends had a fighting chance at human rights
That’s... literally not what I said? The camps I was referencing are the ones currently in existence at the border.   But yeah, better go phone bank for Biden. You’re not changing any hearts or minds here. I remain grateful that I live in a state with ranked choice voting.
No he just keeps a Separation of Church and State as per the Constitution. I’m sure neither his first wife (RIP) or Dr. Biden have had abortions so no he does not ignore it.
Gee, could their motives be to attempt to peel away a certain voting bloc from Biden, maybe? I don't know. Probably not. They wouldn't do something like that.
Can you list out the successful businesses Biden has run for me?
I’ve never seen someone pivot and grandstand so much as Buttigieg. Who actually looked decent early on. I always preferred Hillary Clinton to Biden, but I think my judgment was misplaced, back then I wasn’t as knowledgeable about US politics. She was fairly popular in the UK.
And also Susan, do you agree with the leader of your party - you know you’ve voted 90+% of the time to support his judges - that joe Biden is anti-god? We Mainers are terribly interested. #retiresusancollins
I was siding with Joe Biden.
Biden was the favourite way back in 2017. With his name recognition I’m not surprised he won. There were several better candidates to choose from in the primary. Tbh I am quite surprised he hasn’t picked his VP already. I’d have thought early August would be the right time.
You passed the test Joe - you really are sleepy creepy Joe Biden.
Remember Liberals: every tweet you send complaining about leftists is a tweet you COULD HAVE sent to help get Joe Biden elected. If you really don’t need the left, every second you spend whining about leftists is a second you’re handing to the Trump campaign.   Better get to it!
And yet: the camps became possible because of laws the came to fruition the last time Biden was in the White House.  Use your brain. There’s more nuance here than the *~Blue Wave~* is going to spoon feed you. The longer you ignore root causes, the worse it gets.
Meanwhile Trump is all like “Biden doesn’t even believe in Jebus!”
Unlike biden I would consider myself “against God”
“Poor kids are just as smart as white kids” Eat shit whomever wrote this. We know it wasn’t Biden that’s for sure.
I’ll bet Warren’s poll numbers go UP after being introduced to the country as VP. People like her the more they see of her, and she would do an amazing job selling the electorate on Biden’s policies.  Also, folks LOVE competent female politicians once they’re no longer running...
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Asked about that directly, West said that rather than running for president, he was “walking,” quickly adding that he was “walking . . . to win.”  Exclusive: Kanye West Indicates That His Spoiler Campaign Is Indeed Designed To Hurt Biden
Profoundly indicative of his lack of cognitive function - clearly not able to lead a nation - his family and the National Democratic Party MUST pull him out of this mess - THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE for the really sad use of Mr. Biden simply to get President Trump out-shame on them all
How can we elect someone who isn’t Biden or Trump? Is there a way?
Dbag husband is working with #ComplicitCorruptGOP to get #BunkerBoyTrump  re-elected!  #KayneWest
In fairness, other than Obama and FDR, not sure who inherited a bigger national sh*tshow than Carter.  (Soon to add Biden to the front of that short list).
Perks of being President &amp; running for a 2nd term! 🤷🏻‍♀️ Jim, arent you a journalist? Strange that you’re constantly campaigning for Biden by trying to beat down our President. Better luck next time!
Biden will ein natiobak by 5-8%. He will win every Rust Belt State, except OH will never close. He will win AZ, NV, and NC. He will win FL and has outside shot at TX. It ain’t 2016. People are done with Drumpf. Blue Wave coming.
Biden has been upbto 10 points. He’s leading in every—EVERY— battleground state. OH, Expected to be aDrumpf cakewalk is tied. He stopped spending inRust Belt. Spending in formerly “safe” NV, AZ, NC, GA, TX.  This ain’t 2016–an Electiral inside straight for Drumpf. We’ve  had it.
“Biden will hurt God,” says Golden Calf.
Who wants to tell him that God loves Biden?
“If you can’t improve on silence, don’t.” Words to live by with the Veepstakes. The Biden campaign isn’t talking. We shouldn’t feel the need to fill the void. Looking forward to campaigning for the awesome woman he picks.
trump says hes ready to debate Joe Biden,it will be all Biden could ever hope for,but trump won't ever do it,just like hes trying to delay election,trump isn't even able to handle a press conference,Nixon-Kennedy Debate was a disaster,this debate will be The Tsunami,Titanic,THEND
Nope, he's done more for woman and small businesses than Biden and Obama so I'll proudly support that 🇺🇲
Wish we could move up the election and inauguration of Biden.  I'm ready to vote trump out and clean out the White House.
Joe Biden should challenge Trump to a debate on religion.
Mr. Wallace better be tuff on Biden and ask the questions that need to be asked.   I'm a bit puzzled on where Mr. Wallace really stands on behing fair.  We'll see if he lives up to the standards he portrays.
ATLANTA (AP) — Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden faces new scrutiny over how he discusses race and ethnicity after drawing distinctions between Black and Hispanic populations in the United States.
Biden is planning to kick his sorry ass as we speak.  Payback time.
Trump saying Biden not believing in God is the equivalent of Trump not believing in extra martial affairs or touchy feely relationships with his daughter.
Trump: Joe Biden has "no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He's against God." Give Trump your Bibles. He will take them, under cover of  pepper spray and smoke canisters, uninvited to St. John's Episcopal church to be photographed and protected.
Hope you were listening to your candidate Joe Biden today say ‘unlike the Afro American community , the Latino community is incredibly diverse with different attitudes about different things.’
GOD: Ouch, that hurts!  BIDEN: C'mon, man!  GOD: FINE. &lt;rolls eyes&gt;
Really religion? Biden is a real Catholic. A church going one. Trump isn’t religious and doesn’t go to church. Just another Trump lie
oh boy I'm rich ,trump is trying to stop the election by hiring another idiot,who is causing USPS to go on tilt,because of his fear of votes for Biden,so when do i.pick.up my money?
Some good news in Maine!   #mepolitics
God, Are you there, God? Do you need extra security, because of Biden? Just asking...
Multiple crap things happened to me this week...topped off by someone I barely know questioning why I would vote for Biden over Trump...rather than engage (bc what is the point) I turned on my happy place  #hamifilm ty
So does Nancy  Both denied Catholic sacraments   take note. This is not a time for nuance but to stay true to the word.
Is Kanye West helping Trump by swinging Black votes from Biden? Internet says he's 'puppet of the worst kind'
When I miss Obama, I don’t just miss his humanity, warm sense of humor, his great intellect, generosity of spirit, and civility.  I miss the America that even with all its faults represented those qualities.  I am voting for Joe Biden because he can bring that America back to us.
Biden doesn’t get away with racism as much as you do.
And anybody during this time ,as what you call failure, would fare no better ,definitely not Biden the guy is a gangster .
What did Biden do?
I don’t know. I am not exactly sure we should be making dementia quips when Trump evidently believes that Joe Biden is scheming to take down the Almighty. Not a paragon of lucidity.
Someone will pay for these vaccines from those that pay with their lives to those that get their healthcare raised so high they can't afford it. This guy is a clown. #Biden
I've seen one Biden bumper sticker and I travel to a county over, 25 minutes drive on a good day.
Thanks! Glad to hear there’s enthusiasm elsewhere. Here in Maine it’s been pretty grim. Back in 2016 we saw Clinton signs and stickers everywhere. barely a Biden sign anywhere right now. I’m very worried.
Biden supporters, care to take this on, if so, can you do it without “what about trump?”
My vote for Biden hinges on his veep pick   I would never vote for#senileBiden
Biden is against energy lol.
I heard Biden is also against air. Under Biden there will be no air!
This poll also has interesting numbers on the presidential race here: In the 1st Congressional District, Biden leads Trump 61-30. In the 2nd, Trump has a slim 45-44 edge. Remarkable split and a sign of how different, politically, those two districts have become.
as someone who lives in maine, im especially excited about this new batch  polling:  - Sen: Gideon 48%, Collins 45% - Pres: Biden 53%,  Trump 43%  W/ Biden at 50+1% this could leave Gideon well positioned in a potential RCV runoff
But hey. If Biden picks the wrong VP you are cool
Joe Biden is a sincere and observant Catholic. Trump once reacted to being offered communion at Presybterian church—his alleged denomination—by putting money on the tray.
Trump was anti segregation while Biden fought for it.  Educate yourself and don't be a sheep
Any non Biden vote is a trump vote. please make up your mind

TX AG refuses to expand vote by mail which means almost all of Texas will have to vote on 11/3 and a winner will be announced that night. No recounts in TX unless an exact tie. If Biden squeaks out a wn there, it’s game over.
Trump is doing great campaigning for Biden!  #GoJoe2020 😷
I'm not buying that Biden would know how to powershift.
“I’m not voting for Trump” doesn’t mean “I’m voting for Biden.”
Conservatives all excited that Bill Barr may have dirt on Deep State, Antifa, Obama, Soros, Hillary, or Biden, giving them rabbits #6,980,569 to #6,980,575 to chase.  They are so easily entertained.
But that only works if the people elect Biden?
“Biden “ , &amp; most of us have been watching trumps racist remarks for the last 3 &amp; 1/2 yrs! Plus more!
That sounds like something Joe Biden has had for at least forty years now.
compares Latino communities with black communities: Latinos “incredibly” diverse with different attitudes. Biden doesn’t want to admit strength of black conservatives and independents.
If they censored Biden you’d be pleasuring yourself as you tweeted your full-thrusted support.
No they aren’t.   Look at polling averages and trends.   Biden is up big in every midwestern state.   Drumpf is in Ohio today— was supposed to be a sure thing for him.   Shows you Ohio is in play.   Texas (!) is in play.  Not good for Drumpf.
But the liberal press will never tell these facts.  I think Trump's done well with a the China pandemic that not one was prepared for.  Liberals are using this as a tactic to mask Biden's weak campaign and his mental clarity!
Biden is thr voice of logic, reason and science. #ConsequencesForTrump
They’re preparing you for Biden dying in office...like FDR.
The more they try to smear Biden as a perv the more they're going to hear about trump's decades of perversions
Trump's new low. The wicked, unrepentant con man keeps using photos of Joe Biden praying to convince voters that his rival is weak. Donald, you need to give prayer a try.
g desperate!!! #VoteTrumpOut Trump campaign ad against Joe Biden contains a number of doctored images, CNN and WaPo report
Biden Marxists is a thing 🥴
I can't see a real Biden supporter changing their vote to Kanye.
Lunatic fringe?? Or life under a Biden admin??
shit, just cause it's still trending. I only have 54 followers. i'm never voting biden.   #NoComradesUnder1k
There's no coming back from this, just like the movie theater and gym industries that Radical Far Left Joe Biden would like to tactically compromise to a permanent end
Sally Yates deserves a Cabinet position when  Biden’s elected.
One poll— look at all polls and treblines... Biden is  expanding his lead, it’s at 8-12 points!!!
And yes, I still DO think Biden settled on Warren months ago...
One benefit of all the MSM erasure of Warren as a potential VP is that, when Biden *does* choose her, the MSM will see it as an earth-shattering development that “shakes up the race,” and will give Biden/Warren a huge media boost.  Kamala would be a total snoozefest for them.
tRump must have told his staff he want videos of Biden similar to Lincoln Project style ...but being cheap he could only get a Photoshop Graphic Artist
This allows for only one response from Joe Biden. Joe Biden must deliver his acceptance speech from The Wall surrounding the White House. Tear down that wall...
Biden says border wall construction will stop if he’s elected president  #FoxNews- let in the clowns.
We don’t get what we don’t fight for, and we still fight even when we might lose.  Hey Warren Dems! Are we prepared to keep fighting for #VPWarren? And keep fighting alongside her afterwards, regardless of who Biden chooses?
I’m sorry but, why would he? Your question was out of line and rigg day ridiculous. Not Biden’s fault that President Brainworms took one.
Biden has dementia and can't walk on his own
Not The Onion version of Biden?
Really? What  an idiot. Right now trump has been doing as terrible a job as leader as he is with the coronavirus trying to convince us he’s doing great. 1000k deaths dly , he has done a very very poor job. Hes even been impeached for lying about his attempt to get dirt on Biden.
Conway your hate has been more potent than trumps and that’s not saying much. You say you are catholic and yet spew forth mistruths, hate like non other.  least Biden comes across as intelligent not stupid as u and trump do. Horrible Shameful person.
Michelle Obama says no to public office, but fans still want her as vice president  PLEASE YES MRS OBAMA - there’s no way Trump could beat Biden if you were his running mate. Not only would you be the first women President, but the first Black Women POTUS.
We would? Why? They got the Iraq freaking war facts wrong.  P.S. I wonder if they've sealed the deal with some Trump cultist to do a 10-part series on his upcoming book "Biden Cash."
⁦someone should tell Trumps team that making it look like Biden is hiding, when he is not, is laughable when ⁦ has so recently been caught hiding in #bunkers .....

I didn’t know that Joe Biden in Montana and Idaho! 😂😂🤢🤢😳. #CreepyJoeBiden #Idaho #Montana
Actually, he said he's "forward looking" to them.  Guarantee if there are any debates at all, there won't be a 2nd because the 1st will be such a disaster for Biden that his "team" won't allow him to go another round with Trump.
Biden flubs it again and again! Biden to Black Journalist: ‘Are You a Junkie?’
Lindsey, if you could stop stabbing Mr. Biden in the back for a moment, I'd like to hear this...
If he does a good a job as he usually does he'll CREATE Biden votes. He can't hit the floor with his hat.
Joe Biden couldn’t debate a tickle me Elmo with week batteries
I also love her swinging in like she's some kind of good faith actor, like we all forgot her saying she wasn't gonna vote for Biden, like shut up join the Greens, leave us alone.
The locker hypothesis is interesting. We can imagine that Trump asked one of his minions to provide numbers on the pandemic because, he said, "I want a reason to lock Biden up."
The Democratic Party has slowly started shifting further and further left, to the point where Joe Biden is considered a moderate. I do think this concerns many of the actual moderate Democrats who might like Biden, but may not agree with AOC or Talib. Identity crisis, anyone?
The reason we need debates is because the majority of America has no idea who Joe Biden is now. We can't understand him when he speaks and we have no clue what his policies are except our taxes will go up. People are only going for Biden because they don't like Trump
As the primaries continue to show, progressives is what the Dem Party seems to want. Having a Centrist VP would not be a good look. Don’t be surprised if you see Biden choose Karen Bass or Barbara Lee of California as they seem to fit best the qualities voters are voting 4 now
Umm...Joe Biden is Catholic
Why do you think much of the mainstream media is now saying debates are not necessary? Biden is going to get his clock cleaned if he has a debate with Trump.
Biden will be a great President! Said no one ever!!!
Yeah i responded before i realized someone was pushing Biden again. Respecting that decision should be easy. My response was more to the idea of national campaigns like M4A.
Met a 21-year-old who said she’s voting for Trump because her mother told her Biden is a pedophile. Can only shake my head.
I hope Biden wins and nominates Sally Yates to the Supreme Court just to own the #maga freaks
Leftist is an understatement. I yell at my parents daily to not vote for Biden. Progessive as F*CK. No fossil fuels. 100% organic. Cannabis to the end. BLM.  LGBTQ. M4A. and of course, lastly, F*CK TRUMP  #NoComradesUnder1k
BTW, I usually get ignored after I rebut like this.  So if you want to join the rest of the people who don't have a response, the line is over there. If you do have a plan, please share here.   PS. I'm never going to vote for Biden.
Also, since when is there a heart of Delaware to be deep within? Where is it? Definitely not 5 miles from the state line where Joe Biden lives.
“we have to overcome and destroy systematic racism....by electing a guy who literally helped build it!!! Vote Biden!” It must be nice living in a world where you don’t need logic
It’s odd how so many people who will talk about Trumo being “stupid” or a “mush brain” seemingly have no comment on Joe Biden not being able to form 2 sentences. I wonder the mental gymnastics done to be able to publicly act like that
So maybe Biden could do same
The Democratic party is just as bad as the GOP, they're just better at hiding it. They still bomb, they still favor corporations, they still hate Medicare for all, and yet you praise Bernie as if him giving us Biden is a yay moment. Please.
Oh absolutely. Trump is an easy evil target. Biden isn't as free, and so Bernie was unwilling to do what needed to be done, and now we're all paying the price.   Bernie didn't do his job.
People gave money. To his campaign. Because they thought he'd fight, and they thought he'd win. He didn't fight. His opponent was the easiest person to beat, Joe Biden, and he didn't even try.   He had an obligation to try, and he didn't.
been saying that since he stepped in and tried to make America great...?????How can anyone fix the economy in 4 years let alone him claiming credit for it within the first year.... ridiculous. Mr. Biden you are going to have a tough road ahead to fix this mess but you can do it
Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept the Democratic presidential nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus, party officials said Wednesday, signaling a move to a convention that essentially has become entirely virtual.
so the Democrats caused all of this pain and suffering they hiring Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA ❗️To destroy businesses and property all over the United States just to get Biden elected because he such a weak candidate “amazing”
"That’s Allan Lichtman’s prediction. And Allan Lichtman is always right." WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? WHY?!?!  SPOILER: Lichtman predicts that Biden will win. Now you don't have to give  multiple clicks to get to the punchline. You're welcome.

Joe Biden’s Democratic presidential campaign is reserving $280 million in digital and television ads through the fall, nearly twice the amount President Donald Trump’s team has reserved.
All racist things Biden has said. Truth hurts
How are the misquoted? 40 years in government what has biden done?
I doubt that anyone on the fence about Biden because trump said he is owned by the Radical Left is going to be moved by her distancing from Biden.  I don't see someone like that catching the hint and acting on it.
This guy has been harassing people for 24+ hours straight over not supporting Biden. Lying and bullying. And I mean, either it's a bot, this person doesn't sleep, or it's an account run by multiple people.
That guy definitely thinks he’s smarter than he actually is.  He’ll probably be Biden’s Secretary of State

I find myself wishing Biden had not PUBLICLY committed to choosing a woman. If there were still some male candidates in the VP mix, maybe we wouldn’t have women being pitted against one another...maybe we could have avoided a lot of this VP drama and polarization.
Lots of trolls here tonight who are very sensitive to #hannity rightfully questioning Biden’s mental state.
That’s crazy. You really think Biden wouldnt appoint his own people?
Unfortunately for us, Biden is the lesser of two evils. I’m not enamored with him but I think Trump is destroying the Country. We’ve never been more divided.

Happy Birthday President  Proud to have been a National Delegate for the Obama/Biden ticket back in 2012 and a Youth Organizer for you back in 2008.
Joe Biden is pro-Abortion under all circumstances to a fare-thee-well, like all Democrat party people lately, which makes him &amp; them all not only intolerant &amp; anti-Human Life but also unacceptably ideology driven, inhumane, &amp; yes:  Evil or cultivating evil with aplomb.
#EricIsTheStupidOne VP Biden doesn't have to answer for abandoning us during the pandemic, or allowing Russia to pay a bounty for dead US soldiers, or leading to the worst financial downturn ever, or encouraging Americans to take meds proven not to work, or gassing &amp; beating us.

Sure the Dems strategy of keeping Brain Dead Biden locked in a basement is strange but at least he can’t make a national embarrassment of himself on a daily basis 😂 #trump #maga #AxiosOnHBO  #clown
Whoever is running the Biden Veep Search should be ashamed.  Floating potential picks so that the Media can vet them for free out in the open is cruel and shameful.  Just announce  and be done with it!
Trump does the interviews because he is an attention hound. Biden has done more for getting safety word out on the pandemic than Trump.  Biden knows more about politics, more about the world, so much more qualified that a man whose reputation as a bad businessman is legendary.
They’re everywhere! Can’t wait to vote—which is also our 53rd anniversary! Not a big Biden fan, but at least he seems to care.
I'm ok with it so long as they don't vote, we have to rally every Biden supporter/trump hater to the polls
No you don't. If you did, you wouldn't be supporting Biden who hates the poor, the disadvantaged and POC, all while loving war and his benefactors who include union busters and fossil fuel magnates.
Well you didn't say that you must be a Joe Biden supporter
Look at this Biden Bro who admits he lacks both independent thought and critical thinking skills so needs other people to tell him who to support and how to vote.
But it will under Biden, too.
Yeah, Biden has a stutter but Trump has a  billion dollar loan from Vladimir Putin.
Nice interview. (For Biden)
Pelosi and Schumer! Biden would just be a puppet to these two idiots.
The #Biden tide is quickly transitioning to a wave. Tidal wave watch now in effect!
He probably listened to Biden's speeches about CV19 and gun violence.
Did you see the Axios interview? Biden skipping the debates would be doing your candidate a favor. Your dog can no longer hunt.
The  Biden hiding in his basement narrative is lame. Here’s a counter. Everyone remembers Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Everyone will remember trump golfed while 160K Americans died, while 40 million were unemployed &amp; while Putin paid bounties for US soldiers lives.
I mean dan’s tweet is clearly political as their union endorsed Biden. I just find it funny that with their performance suffering lately now is the perfect time for mail in voting.
Well Biden/Obama dont support gay marriage, but trump is the first president to openly support it. There's a lot of bills trump has passed that show his compassion in actions, not words. Of course he's rough around the edges and talks off the cuff but he's the most transparent
So you're not voting for something, you're voting against something. Interesting. I'm sure you're aware of the racism Biden has displayed over the years as well? You'd be surprised how much conservatism has changed since trump. I mean I'm a conservative and I'm all for
No I'm asking why you support Biden, you should be able to do that without mentioning Trump
So serious question, why do you support Biden?
To take black and brown votes from Biden. GOP operatives are helping him. This is for 45.
You're the Biden supporter. Why don't you explain, being an expert and all.

Actually it makes sense. If he gets these items in the budget and properly scheduled the work to begin after Jan 20, then he can turn around and accuse Biden of misusing funds.

Brought to you by the same people who have Biden leading in the polls. I don’t even think 67% of people wear them correctly. People are afraid to stand up.
Joe Biden is full of it ,nothing done in 50 yrs in Washington ,just taken a tax payer pay check
Polls themselves aren’t importsnt. TRENDS are.   Biden is trending away from Drumpf nationally and in almost every battleground state.   His lead is far superior to unpopular Hillary’s in 2016– and she won vote by 3 million!   He’s lost elderly, suburban women, &amp; educated whites.
Better is what we need. My cat would be better. And my car and my blender and my dog’s poop. And Biden.
Says a dude that thinks Joe Biden is a communist.
It doesn’t matter if you believe Biden is just camouflage for an Obama third term.
Just seems like Biden has leads in a lot of states he doesn't need, and Trump's behind in a lot of states he needs.
I wonder how Matty will reconcile Biden lying about the accident that took his wife and daughter, ruining a man's life and reputation just for sympathy and clout.

Enjoy living in a socialist country! Do you even have a remote clue as to what Biden's platform is? You just aren't very intelligent are you?
Yeah, but Biden is going to take California without a problem. I think Reagan might’ve been the last Republican to actually take California. The Democrats planned their takeover of that state well, and they’ve done the same thing in my state of Maine. The GOP sat back &amp; let them.

That was question about the composition of the Supreme Court.  If RBG is incapacitated before December then McConnell would put a trump nomination through.   If Biden wins and RBG retires or is incapacitated after January 21, 2021 then he'll get to nominate someone.
I mean, you can't have it both ways. Since we vote based on policy, and not by team or candidate, and Biden wants/needs our votes, a reasonable conclusion is to adopt those policies.
Biden's deteriorating mind worsens!
We can fight corrupt system, but in the interim I'd rather have dems in charge of it.  Failure on pandemic, gutting environmental regs, paramilitaries gassing protesters diverts leftist energy.  Do people honestly think Biden will continue those things?
The Biden campaign brings a certain physical element that your spreadsheets just can’t account for
I just read that  isn’t supporting Biden!
If you support joe Biden, you’re no better than her.
Who will you be voting for? I’m not dissing you. Just curious.  If you don’t vote at all, it will be a bit for the winner - probably Biden. I was a Liz Warren gal. But anyone but Trump for me. Just get the Democrats in and I think things will change for the average American💙
like, don't get me wrong--Biden largely sucks, and i've still got my heart in my throat for a fuckton of reasons, but i agree, equating this with 2016 is pretty silly.

Why would Biden supporters be cheering your arrival
And why are you so bent on veering the conversation away from Biden's inadequacies? Is it because you can't defend them and you don't want to face them, Evan?
Why? He's not running for president. It's a non-issue at this point what his vote was. But, Biden is. And he wrote the thing.
The year was 1988. My first ever presidential election. Living in Washington, DC. Democratic primary. Jesse Jackson got my vote. Joe Biden was on the ballot.
While Biden is an actual POS who helped design the modern prison industrial complex.

wow. really bad poll numbers for donald trump. biden doing great, leading by far. bloated orange dementia patient not a factor!!! also, resign.
Yep. Just like Obama needed a non-threatening white racist as a running mate in 2008 to appeal to white people — enter Joe Biden.
And we're saying we supported policies that Biden doesn't.
Wait for it. He'll reply with some meme of a whole bunch of policies the DNC nor Biden support.
And I say that if you support Biden you're not a progressive. Then again, shitlibs have a habit of co-opting terms and basterdizing them.
Who's arguing that point? What I see is you coming to someone else's tweet about lesser evil options pulling out failed tactics of vote shaming. Do you really think being a turd and bully on Twitter will work? If you feel that strongly, start 📞🏦ing for Biden.
Look at that crowd. Only Biden could draw a smaller one.
Bad joe Biden
Oh, geez. If I was Joe Biden, This would so not look good for my job portfolio.
Seriously lovely and powerful ad for Biden.  Check it out!
Joe Biden promises to:  1. Clean up GOP debt ridden spending spree 2. Move the country toward renewable energy sources 3. Make sure the insured aren’t paying for the uninsured &amp; that human beings have medical help when they need it.   We see you, GOP &amp; know what you stand for.
At this point it's obvious Trump has abdicated his responsibilities as President.  If we want something done about anything, we will have to do it extra-governmentally.  Corporate titans, Joe Biden, NGOs, advocacy groups, ordinary people, what say you?!  It's time for us to lead.
Nope. It’s because most third party candidates are bat shit crazy or clearly planted to create a split among the opposing voters. A vote for anyone but Biden is a vite for Trump.
On average, Biden is up by 9 points in Michigan, 11 points in Pennsylvania and 10 points in Wisconsin –
Well, I’m not concerned. And what are these “other ways” you speak of? Of all that’s going on now, for Biden to take the time he needs to feel confident in the most important decision he will make in this election is actually more reassuring.
Everything Biden does is mediocre
Where's the Biden parades? Oh right, Biden supporters can't afford boats🤭🤭
Trump tries time claim that Biden is soft on China but it turns out Trump administration doled out up to 419 million to businesses that China either owns or invests in. I’m betting Trump getting paid by both Russia and China when he leaves office.

Joe Biden is just awful
dems check out levin aug. 1st sat. eve. an u want biden i dont think so the dems will destroy dems an gops america as we know it will b gone please vote 4 trump 2020
best way to support Biden is to not behave like President Trump.  "Orange fraud"? Responsible, grown-up politics doesn't include name calling/insults. Rise above it. Conservatives had all kinds of nasty names and things to say about President Obama.
democrats look 4 levin show on aug 2nd if your not scared of what u hear then u deserve biden
It means I think Trump is a tik tock. I’d never vote for Biden, but if I had to make the argument to vote for him, I’d simply say “Biden has fucked us over forever, and really sucks, but Trump is monumentally self absorbed topped with a ton of creamy stupid.” It’s a very low bar.
And Biden has 10x more enthusiasm to get the Orange Stain out of office!
- a no- Biden vote is a vote for your and my train car.
well if we vote for Netenyahu its like voting for Both Trump and Biden all at once !!
And you are surprised why? The dude is WAY over his head as are those in his Administration . God help us if Joe Biden doesn’t win- this is the only time in my life that I have feared for our Country and my life!!!
Mail in voting allows millions of more DEMs to vote. Huge advantage for Biden there. Drumpf’s only hope is to sabotage the Postal Service—which he is trying to do.
He doesn’t have to remove Drumpf. On Jan 20, Biden is potus. Secret Service will escort the Orange Stain out of the WH. He will be indicted the next day.
Drumpf is at 41% approval. He’s down an average of 8-9 points nationally. The only dring state in play now is Ohio. Trump is down in FL, NC, PA, MN, MI, WI. TX is in play. GA is in play. UT is in play. Biden leads big in AZ.
Brain Dead  Biden talking science. 🙄
The damage is being done by democratic leaders letting their big cities get destroyed by rioting and looting. This is shameful. Biden will just be a puppet to the democratic leaders like Pelosi and Schumer who will be pushing all the buttons.
Name the “key” states. Show me that data.   Republucans are a smaller party than Democrats. Hence the polling ratios.   Pollsters know what they are doing-/ it’s their job. EVERY poll has Drumpf getting hammered!   Show me ONE poll that has Drumpf leading Biden nationally. One!!
That would guarantee a Biden win. No.
Who could be Joe Biden's running mate?  via  Really hope it’s not Socialist Mad Professor Warren. Looking to vote for Biden, but will vote for Trump or Mickey Mouse before Warren.

Not necessarily. She's MAGA. She thinks Biden is a Marxist, I'm sure.
Biden is garbage, and most of us are voting for him anyway. supporting the anti-Tr*mp ticket doesn't mean we need to stay quiet about the life-and-death problems of Biden's policy history and plans.
this whole "don't criticize the candidates" thing is nonsense. whoever Biden picks for VP will need to be examined.
I like to think Biden's having fun toying with us all. ("Hey, let's float Mary Landrieu next. Yeah, Landrieu Ha Ha Ha perfect! I can hear the hearts exploding now....")
Yes, Biden will
Respond by voting for Joe Biden November 3rd.
Joe Biden could shoot Donald Trump on fifth ave and I would still vote for him.
Any vote for a third party only helps trump win, because his voters will not also vote for a third party. Therefore the only effect is to drag Biden down and prop up Trump. It’s basic math.
In addition to election trolling and interference by a foreign entity, and the normal GOP disinformation campaigns, there has been a GOP research project on Biden that is increasingly mentioned.  Rumors that some report will be released in October?
Better question is who will joe Biden’s VP choice. Choose as VP. When joe is forced out.
Chaz I too support Joe Biden no matter what but my choice for voters VP is Kamala Harris as well..she's got it all!
You're doing a bang-up job connecting with potential voters, there, William. Just like you do with your students. You should try your hand at phone banking. Biden needs a lot of help.
At quick glance I bought that this was an actual Biden tweet. Sigh. I fucking hate 2020
The ‘Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left’ campaign strategy is banking on independents not having friends that are liberals and leftists
I wish Biden would actually take a position that has majority support lol.  He’s against M4A, legal weed, taxing the rich, free college, wiping away student debt, GND, ending the wars. American people want these policies but oligarchs don’t. Who does Biden listen to?
Seems like a good reason to vote Biden
Reality Check:  Biden is cognitively smart enough to stack the administration with intelligent professionals!  You know... educated folks to “assist” in running the government??  We currently have a kakistocracy!!
Scared, huh?  I'd start thinking along the lines of criminal defense attorneys, instead of making up lies about Biden.
I don't think anyone is negating that Trump is a terrible human but you have to come with more than 'he's corrupt' when talking about blood on his hands when Biden literally has decades of wars and the modern prison industrial complex under his belt.
Biden doesn't even know what he's running for, let alone him picking anything
Sorry to hear we disgust you. Joe Biden might “care” about us, but he looks down on us, pities us. Accordingly his policies haven’t improved our plight. Trump addressed incarceration and opportunity zones. I’m for school choice. Sorry to say, but Trumps the one with new ideas
Voting Locally I did . Haven't liked any of our presidents ever all war criminal shitbags that don't care about our planet and somehow we are suppose to believe Biden is a  contrast to trump? a choice?! what choice? both party's protect the 1% !
For some reason, I just stumbled upon this thread. I completely agree and am thrilled you still feel this way. With Warren as an active VP, I think Biden’s presidency could be more than transitional; it could be transformative. How could he resist a chance at that legacy...
I want Biden to pick her just so we can all watch this.  After six months of Covid, it’s the least we deserve.
The laughter was deafening 😬 #Biden  #Gutfeld
Biden settled on Warren months ago, but his comms team insisted that the best time to roll out a VP choice is when nominees typically do it: no more than a week before the convention.  Until then, comms has to work like hell leaking other names to throw off the media!

I believe Hispanic means people who speak Spanish &amp; Latino is the race of people from Latin America but I'm not sure. To answer your question, I'm half Latino &amp; I am offended, not because Biden isn't choosing a Latino VP, but because he promised to pick based on race &amp; gender.
Agreed. Teens and twenty somethings were on the warpath last night. This is the biggest GOTV move Trump could ever make with youth, for Biden....
I trust the Biden campaign to vet whom ever is chosen. I’m assuming the same vetting the Obama ( don’t do stupid shit) campaign did on Biden. I just don’t think this particular bit of history is a deal breaker. She’s not MY pick, but Biden &amp; his pick have my vote.
No need to apologize. I'm with you. I'm writing in #Bernie2020. Never Biden. Never a rapist, racist or any other criminal liar.
Let’s be real here. I’m voting for Biden no matter what. And I think it will be the other way around. Trump doesn’t know how to talk. Joe Biden does.

If you think Joe Biden is making the V.P. decision you haven't been paying attention to Joe Biden.  Obama and the Clintons probably have more say in his pick than he does.
It’s like the primary all over again: “It’s so weird that Black primary voters keep choosing Biden! They must not know that Booker and Harris are in the race!”  Most Black voters calculated that Biden had the best chance of beating Trump. And they were RIGHT.

Where were these Lincoln project people 4 years ago? You only want him out cuz you already got your tax cut.... And Biden is essentially a republican
Honestly, I think the white dems across the spectrum have seen the recent Biden-Trump polls and think they can win without enthusiastic Black dem turnout.
I disagree with the 1 term view, because Biden is a creature of the Senate where people continue working into their late 80’s. Biden seems to get more life from work than he did while retired. I understand the 1 term view, just not sure it applies.
If  wants to destroy his election chances, go ahead and choose Karen Bass as VP. For fucks sake get your picks dammit! #ScientologyIdiots
Hmm, I wonder. It would be entertaining if Biden brought all 56 of trump’s accusers along with Epstein’s corpse to the debates.
I’d like to see Biden announce his entire cabinet when he announces his VP pick. I think it would take the pressure off “the pick” and be a very good indicator of his admin direction, which I believe will be smart &amp; inclusive. Also a contrast with the “acting” Trump cabinet.
Biden has to be having second thoughts about Kamala, otherwise why delay the announcement until August 10?  Name her and get it over with!

Even I must admit that is hogwash. He's doing everything humanly possible to lose this election. This is Bush Sr losing touch with reality territory circa 1992. I'm not a fan of Biden, but he may win by default.

You can’t change spots on a leopard Joe Biden did nothing for the American people Beijing in washington for 50 years and it won’t change if he should get elected  , same old story nothing from nothing leaves nothing.
Let’s get something straight ,Media and Joe Biden  reappropriating funds somewhere else is called defunding , unless it  is going to the Police.
How, exactly, is Biden, who has been a private citizen for the last 3.5 years, destroying the US fossil fuel industry?
I mean, could be either MAGA or blue MAGA. They're both notorious for it. But, she is a Biden supporter.
Well, I guess with court docs placing #BillClinton on the isle-o-child-rape, we're reasonably protected from a Hillary "Oh shit, Biden is senile we've got to do something" candidacy.
Something all Americans should know your Democratic Representatives sold out to China year’s ago starting with the Clinton ‘s and then again with the Obama administration s andif Joe Biden is elected it will continue to sell out Americans to China
I'm hoping for a Lakers-Celtics finals. Forget Biden. That's kind of nostalgia the nation needs right now
Biden doesn’t have any sort of plan for what he’s gonna do as president he’s just gonna say well I’m not trump and that’s his whole fucking campaign and YOU VOTED FOR IT IN THE PRIMARIES????
Cherry picked that so Biden is running up a ramp instead of going down it 😂 you need to change your username if you're gonna cherry pick and take things out of context. He never called Mexicans as a whole as rapists, he called ms13 that.
Or, for a change, they can blame Biden’s mess on Biden. And the rest of the “first do some harm” Democrats. Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and the rest of us along with them. NO to both capitalist parties.
They are going to pivot to full-on "Joe Biden is a radical leftist who will destroy America and take all your freedoms."  I think it will be primarily lefty fear mongering, flavored with racist pandering.
He has adopted zero of Bernie’s policies...quite literally zero. And all of Bernies policies are supported by an overwhelming majority of the dem party and a solid majority of the American people. Biden better than Trump but he’s still a pawn of the oligarchs 🤷🏼‍♂️
The Democratic electorate seems to have already made that decision itself by nominating Biden and for a second time rejecting Sanders. Which in this election, if the goal is to defeat the current president, was the right choice.
This is such a pathetic argument to convince people to vote for anyone yet it's the only one that anyone has to vote for Biden. The uninspiring aura about him, the racism that drips out of his mouth, the decades of right-wing policy, the lack of even pandering to the left 👍
It’s funny reading peoples responses as though Biden even knows this was posted. He doesn’t know where his handlers keep the butterscotch pudding, never mind what Twitter is

The thing is, if Biden ends up making a more conventional VP choice like Harris/Whitmer, it probably won’t seem to have been that consequential, since a conventional VP wouldn’t end up doing much.  But those of us who ❤️ Warren would mourn the loss of what COULD HAVE BEEN.

She was my top pick for President. I wanted Biden out of the running, at least he'll surround himself with intelligent, competent people. I'm voting blue no matter who.
Yes Trump is a coward..my brother volunteered for Vietnam..we need to elect Joe Biden
I think if Trump wins, it will be a huge fraudulent election. Biden can never ever concede!
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
And he will incite his followers to violence. Biden is going to have to make it clear that if Trump/Barr order, or incite violence against the people that they will be held accountable.
I wouldn't hold my breath on that. Fully expect an aggressive effort to push (all-too-willing) colleges to return to Obama policies, &amp; surge of lawsuits as a result. One of the few policy issues on which Biden is a true believer rather than a weathervane.
Precisely--had predicted this as a likely loss for student after oral argument. (Case had some procedural problems as well.) Outcome a good reminder of how skeptically even liberal circuits have come to look at the assumptions underlying Biden's approach to this issue.
You have nothing to worry about. Biden will accept and you will be gone. It’s that simple. #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBiden2020 #DumpTrump2020
When did ambitious become a bad word. In every job I have ever had I always worked hard all while thinking about the next job for me. When Kamala does it, somehow how it’s bad. So sick of this sexist mentality in our country.

It absolutely is, but if we don't elect Biden, there will never be a chance to raise it again. Can't fix the country if it burns down.
Biden Election Day is Nov 3. Per POTUS declaration, if you are voting for Trump, be at the polls early the week of Nov 10th. Pass it on.
Trump probably wants to do that but he can't because he has to handle the coronavirus. He seems very anti-China. Biden on the other hand wants to be allies with them and that cannot be.
Time to call out Hidin' Joe Biden for his lack of support for Law and Order.

But she is a black woman. I thought they were the only savior to the country? Biden won't think your lies are true. So hush.
I mean, there's a pretty good chance the Republic won't survive another Trump term. It will definitely survive Biden. That's enough.
Is it too late for Biden to do the same
Biden is 78. Who cares?
Yes to all of this but I don't see what Harris does for the ticket. She struggled to connect with voters during her own campaign, she's from CA which Biden will win handily anyway and her history as a prosecutor will be a stumbling block.
Seriously? You need to get your shit together before you go to prison... #NobodyLikesTrump #Biden
I wonder what Hillary Clinton is going to feel when which every women is selected as Bidens running mate &amp; if Biden wins will be the FIRST WOMEN PRESIDENT. Biden will step down his last year of his Presidency so his VP will become President to show Americans she’s up to challenge
Totally understandable. AP has a GREAT section called AP Fact Check, that will break down a speech by Trump or Biden, or a claim from someone about COVID, and inform the reader of the ACTUAL facts of that topic, or their claim. I've learned a TON from that section.
If Biden takes the same test and passes, I will gladly also make fun of Trump
Even if you're a supporter, you must see by now that if Joe Biden was your uncle, the family would be discussing how to gently take away his car keys.

One of the few bright spots of Biden picks Kamala will be her having to walk back the whole “I think Biden is a closet racist” remark. That will be fun
Martha did not say that. She randomly threw out her name as a possibility if she weren’t picked as VP.  That said, anyone else getting the willies over the Biden line-up? 4 years of shrill shrews? Sorry, there!s no emoji for slitting one’s throat.
See, I don't trust Biden to actually get behind those things. He can say anything he wants. His history shows that he's beholden to power and not to the people.
If there WILL be debates. Biden could never handle that! And perhaps Biden will show up somewhere, just not in the proper place because he gets lost all the time!
Oh Biden is in bed with the Chinese. If he wins, America will be RULED by the CCP!

Then I guess the establishment should have moved further toward the progressive goal post. I’m not giving my vote to someone just because I hate the incumbent. If Biden needed the progressive vote he should have offered up more than he did. (Which was NOTHING)
It was sarcastic because everyone was calling Bernie supporters toxic during the primaries 🙄 I assure you, anyone not voting for Biden either hates his policies or is deeply concerned about his cognitive shortcomings
Who cares? If Biden can’t garner votes on his own merits its the fault of himself, his policies and the

Not quite.  At his current lead, Biden will take both the popular vote and the E.C.  This isn't Hillary's lead.
Gore was not my candidate. McGovern was not my candidate. Kerry was not my candidate. Biden was not my candidate. Every single one of them way better than their general election opponents. (Btw., you said the Supreme Court elected Bush and then you demonstrated it was you.)
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
It should not have been close enough for the Supreme Court to put Bush in office. Yes Gore had weaknesses (Pssst so does Biden), but Gore would never have taken the USA to war in Iraq. Gore would have addressed climate change.
You idiots need to get a grip. The protests may even fizzle out once Biden is elected and we have an administration that will work to benefit all Americans.

Biden-Harris ticket is 'Trojan horse for socialism,' says Marc Thiessen  #FoxNews- Yes, Harris a socialist will help ruin our democracy. Those of us who prefer to keep our medical will be forced off by Harris, Sanders, the squad because Biden is a puppet.
you don't owe Democrats your vote, they owe you a decent candidate that gives a shit about the working class.  having said that, please vote for Biden in November. we can work towards holding the DNC accountable for their bullshit once we deal with Tr*mp
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
The Biden train derailed!!😂😂#MAGA2020
Rightly so her facts are not right ,people are looking for real leadership not false aquisations , 8 yrs of less than stellar performance of Obama and Biden  economy is no inheritance kamala none at all.
Biden, senile and used as a puppet by his overlords, scary to see who’s calling the shots on him
Speaking to friends and coworkers who, like me, are not voting for Trump and reaaalllllllly don’t want to vote for Biden, the pick of Harris for VP has not excited us or made us change our minds about Biden. The general feeling is one of disappointment in the Democrats.
hold biden’s feet to the fire, try and move him left. but if anyone thinking about voting for trump. please don’t. you can message me on here and we can discuss if anyone want to tak more about it.
Birtherism: evil  Criticism about how Biden and Harris masquerade as progressive but primarily protect corporate interests: valid  Still have to vote for them: obviously
obviously i’m not Biden’s biggest fan. but anyone on the fence between him and Trump needs to reevaluate their lives. Biden-Harris may not be ideal, but Trump’s unique and overt racism/facism needs to be removed from office
I am pretty disappointed in a lot of people lately. I can’t believe some of you are going to shout ACAB, be part of the me too movement, and claim you’re anti racist and go and vote for fucking Biden with his top law enforcement VP. All because the orange man is bad. Hypocrites.

Biden-Harris will deliver!
If Biden drops out of Debates....then one more cut in the Death by a Thousand Cuts..I have some faith left in American people and think the ones who speak out the loudest are the minority and the weak
Biden and Harris ,before you accuse the opponent of wrong doing ,or blame ,get your facts straight, you sound ridiculous ,American people not stupid like you think.
Checking Twitter: -Jeanine Pirro is making veiled threats against Biden. -Herman Cain is tweeting from the grave. -Everyone is fighting with boomers again.
But the more people do it, the more comfortable other people will be. At the very end of our street, a big Biden flag went up yesterday 😊
I was genuinely shocked by my messages. A woman I would have guessed is a republican sent me a long message about Biden &amp; how she’s happy to see him on the ticket.
Which, that’s the thing about drumming up excitement. It’s not just about me &amp; my little Biden lawn sign &amp; my neighbors four Trump signs. It’s about getting other people excited or interested or inspiring them to get a sign, to vote, etc.
I posted about my Biden sign on Instagram (where I’m mostly followed by people who know me IRL) and got some very interesting messages!!!
Hermain Cain died on July 30th yet someone is tweeting anti-Biden/Kamala propaganda from his own Twitter account.   Politics = disgusting.
I am ridin’ with Biden and “Harley” Harris!!
"We’ve created more jobs in the last 3 months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their 8 years in office."  You did no such thing. You guys just forced people off unemployment, and back into the workforce prematurely. Not the same thing.
The idea of Joe Biden or Kamala Harris being "radical-left" is laughably absurd.
"After the event,  told a  reporter, 'If the #science allows us, you’re going to see us campaigning together.'" &lt;~ In every contrast with Trump, the #BidenHarris2020 ticket wins. I'll vote for science. Let's have a

I thought Kamala Harris had a lot of wonderful ideas as president I’m sure she’ll bring them to the table with Biden as a VP this is gonna be great thank you all for your wonderful work let’s get out there and vote state State I thought Kamala Harris had a lot of wonderful ideas
Right: not a centrist nationally, but isn't a step or two to the left of Biden closer to the center of the coalition the Dems are putting together?
The attacks on Kamala Harris are valid critiques of her policy positions, but let’s try not to fuel too much dissent so close to the election. She is CLEARLY better than Pence. At least we will have Progressive voices like Bernie at the table with the Biden/Harris ticket.
you think Biden's gonna win florida? lol
Then, frankly, you should be WAY more disgusted with Trump and Melania, than Biden and Harris...
Doc: Could you say that the Harris pick is a move to the center, since the disappearance of  conservative Dems like Breaux, Baucus or Lieberman means Biden's version of liberal moderation is now the party's right wing?
Shout out to the Trump supporters justifying their beliefs by repeatedly posting Biden being creepy.  💫FYI💫THEY ARE BOTH SEXUAL PREDATORS!  25 FUCKING WOMEN ACCUSED OUR PRESIDENT OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT MEANWHILE HE BRAGS ABOUT BEING IN THE POSITION OF POWER TO DO SO.
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record.
Of course. But he'd have virtual rallies and garner millions of views. Biden's virtual rallies garner hundreds at best.
So the candidate that ended the #metoo movement has picked the woman who will end the #blm movement as his running mate. 360 million people in this country and our choices for president are Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris. We can and must do better people. It starts locally.
Opinion | Why conservatives like me are backing Biden — and attacking Senate Republicans  via
This is sad you think that. All of it. That Biden won't follow suit and fill his cabinet with donors and kiss asses and that a vote is wasted just because it's not how you would vote. This shaming didn't work in 2016.
I'm knocking the inability of Biden to draw crowds virtually and physically in any mass. Then again, this is the candidate telling people to vote in the primary because it was safe 🤷‍♀️
Am I excited to vote for Biden and Harris? No. Am I excited for the chance of removing a racist, mysogynistic, capitalistic LOSER from office? You better fucking believe it, Donny boy. I hope these next months are the last time this world ever has to hear your dumbass speak.
I think Curtis would be happy with Biden/Harris choice of his music ,music dates you,so I'm sad that we have to battle again trump has used Stones,McCartney &amp;Neil Young,wrong people to cross,they have more fans than him,their gigs are always sold out,no empty seats
If their record causes someone to not vote for them, that's an issue with Biden, Harris, and the DNC. Not the voters nor those who she'd light on it.

No.  Trump / Pence is sad.   Now we have a chance to live.  We should be grateful and rejoice for good people instead of worrying about their beliefs, and Biden demonstrates his deep faith.  I’m Catholic and I’m happy.  I feel sorry for you.

If Joe Biden had picked Atlanta’s mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms as his VP, he would have had the most iconic campaign name in American electoral history
fuck joe biden
what do you think of biden’s vp pick — anyone but trump
If Bernie was more popular than Biden, this wouldn’t have hurt him, it would have given him clear path to victory.... unfortunately the majority of the party voters didn’t want him..
It’s not... but you can’t see what happened with the Bernie blinders on. Sucks.  On the bright side, Harris voted with Bernie over 90% of the time..  I trust Biden and Harris to do a better job than we have gotten over the last 3 plus years of hell.
Jeanine Porto suggests something will happen to Biden before the election and he won’t be the nominee. Others on Fox have to walk back her comments. That woman is bat💩crazy.
No one dares laugh at Trump. That gives him power.  Biden will laugh &amp; suddenly everyone’s chest will be less tight because laughing at power IS power.  It’s the thing Biden can do that no one else can. Watch his debate with Ryan. It’s the laughter that wins. Chief. Malarkey. Son
Hillary couldn’t do it bc women play by different rules bc life is garbage. Also people already hated her.  No other D candidate gets away with it like Biden does because Uncle Joe means well &amp; America knows it. They know him.  So yeah he’s gonna tell Trump he’s full of shit
Everyone got so mad that Biden said that (ringer, w/ NRA ties) guy who yelled at him about guns was full of shit.  You don’t get it. That’s the only kind of thing that works with Trump &amp; however many of his voters can be moved at all.  He’s gonna say something similar to Trump
There is absolutely no political argument or policy debate or gotcha moment that can phase Trump. He has no morals, he doesn’t care, consistency is nothing.  But Biden will laugh &amp; call it bullshit &amp; that does get through. Fascists must be serious. They cannot take anything less.
It’s a superpower because Biden can laugh at his opponent and come off genuine and kind, like grandpa watching you fuck up. He doesn’t come across as a dick, he just seems right.  Trump won’t have an audience to pump him up &amp; Joe will laugh at him like the joke he is.
I keep thinking about the debates &amp; ive heard all the doom-moaning but I think they’ll be amazing  Biden has a superpower. You can’t get Trump on facts or morals. He doesn’t care  Biden’s gonna laugh in his face just like he did to Ryan. THAT he can’t stand. That goes to his core
Finally, leaders that listen to medical experts for a medical problem. As I write this, I am still in disbelief that we have to look outside the current administration for this kind of leadership. Voting for Biden/Harris will save thousands of lives. Vote BLUE4LIFE Vote RED4DEATH

okay but people can still be critical of Harris and Biden even if they vote blue  because treating them like "saviors" would risk allowing them to get away with a lot, simply because "at least they aren't 45"  it's okay to have high standards and keep them there
This is sick and frightening...it's almost a threat to Biden!!
Were you upset today when Biden pronounced it exactly the same?
And by the way, I really liked your vomit joke when it came towards the Joe Biden and Kamla Harris thing. 🤣🤣😂😂😂. I was LMBO!!
And of course, we should all vote and GOTV for Biden like our lives depend on it. Etc, etc.
The DNC never cared about the South. And then, they didn’t care about Northern Union Workers. We use Biden and Harris to get past Trump, then we transform the Democratic Party into a more progressive, climate minded, socially equitable political system.
Republicans are really reaching. Nothing they say about Biden sticks. Kamala confuses them. They've got nothing. #TheReidOut
I think it would be fun to watch Biden attempt  saying that slogan.....”you know the thing”🤣
Joe Biden could have chosen the most effective VP in 100 years.  The fact that he *didn’t*—despite all the evidence—doesn’t speak well for his judgment.

Lol that time Joe Biden was at my first holy communion (his granddaughter was in my Sunday school class), and my grandma fan girled him and told him she voted for him
You can't just vote, you need to rally your followers to do what the Judy Jacobs Central Oyster Bay Democratic Club is doing. We're contacting the Biden campaign to do remote phone banking for the swing States. Our votes in NY are not going to make a difference in PA, MI,WI, etc
if ur a liberal or socialist. shut up i hate u vote for biden and call it a day. ur just as bad as the right
Kudos to you  for giving little girls, especially black and brown girls, a sense that all is possible and maybe one day, they will grow up to be president. Thank you Joe Biden ❤️❤️❤️❤️

You would have to be an idiot to blame Trump for all of the jobs lost. What? Should we not have locked down and saved thousands of lives? The Democrats seem to believe this. If America elects Biden he will destroy this country and many more Americans will die.

I'm really excited about the possibilities of a Biden / Harris administration and the progress we can make on #ClimateAction and environmental justice. Who kicked VWs butt for falsifying emissions data?

The giddiness CNN and MSNBC show regarding Biden and Harris is vomit inducing in comparison to the unfair and vile treatment of Trump
If Americans know anything about Joe Biden from the Obama era, it's that he's a...checks notes...radical extremist?
This is a weird take...Biden literally said he was going to pick a black woman, which makes the choice not based solely on merit, and eliminates a massive number of qualified people, Mr. “Acheive Legend” isn’t racist for pointing that out
I am thrilled! Kamala Harris is an intelligent and mature leader. We need her!!!!! Go Kamala!
You’re killing me! Best comedy routine in a long time! Biden/Harris

Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris today:
I feel that Biden's choice to exclude all men for his VP pick is sexist. I feel that is a very bad message to be sending. Sexism to the other extreme, benefiting the other sex, is frankly, still sexism.  No?  Yes, I get it, white men have the upper hand over women in these roles.
I never have the popular opinion so I apologize in advance for the eyeroll you are likely to have after reading what I 'for whatever reason' have to get off my chest.  Let me start with hell yes-I will be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket in November - but I am sad.  A thread
I love Kamala Harris as VP, she seemed very sharp during the Democratic debates. Biden/Harris have my vote! 🇺🇸
Darn right ✅ about that one. Why is he feeling sorry 😞 for Joe Biden?  Talking about kamala was nasty to Joe.  He should listen to himself talking about nasty.
VP Biden I was so happy you entered the Presidential race. You had my vote up till yesterday, as a Baby Boomer &amp; Middle Class citizen I can no longer vote for you picking a socialist as your running mate. In fact if a large majority of Baby Boomers votes this year Trump wins.

Biden lost the election once he picked a socialist as his running mate.
not only black voters.   older black voters and middle class voters voted biden.   younger black voters and poor voters voted bernie.   young people just vote in less numbers than old people. this isn’t new information, it just doesn’t fit the clean narrative
Yeah we all know it’s Kamala running for President, it’s a waiting game of when Biden will resign, I give it till Mid June 2021 if, big IF, he is elected.
did i say black people were the establishment? no.  who’s VP is she? joe biden, a white guy who she attacked for being kind to segregationists less than a year ago. i ment centrist establishment.
I don’t blame anyone for being unenthusiastic about voting for Biden, I’m not. Unfortunately with RBG’s SC seat opening realistically soon another Kavanaugh could be a serious danger to many people’s civil liberties.

Biden is very smart. He is basically playing out the clock
Vote in person. Elect Biden.  I'd say that's the simplest plan.
who's more racist her or biden?
Knowing me when I have the ballot in my hand I’ll probably concede and tick the Biden box anyway...  This fucking sucks.
I agree. It doesn’t do anything. NY is going to Biden Harris and my not voting for them does nothing besides make me feel better.
Harris has all indications of covering every minority voters wish,I think optimism may be in store for us poor Democrats,ha ha,GOP must be having trouble finding a V.P. now that Biden has blown his mind with Harris
get off your high horse, there is a reason biden went from 40% in the polls down to 10% before winning &amp; Kamala dropped out before any primaries happened.   i obviously prefer them over Trump &amp; holding elected officials to account is what you are supposed to do.
I confess I don’t quite get why the E in Biden is emphasized in the logo?   Is it for “Elect”? “Election?” “Excellence?” “Equality?”   “Eleganza?”
people who don’t understand that in politics you are supposed to hold people to account. so people that are upset about Biden Harris ticket are allowed to be upset(it’s a horrible ticket) but as long as everyone realizes the real goal is removing Trump from office
The number of times I have seen people hiss at Biden for saying he’d pick a woman because that wasn’t picking the most qualified person and men would be passed over…far too high
I won’t be voting for Biden Harris. Sorry. I’ll vote dem down ballot but NY is going to go to Biden anyway so the least I can do is make myself feel a little better with a useless display of contention against this.
I'm a progressive who isn't thrilled about Biden or Harris, but I know they're way better than Trump &amp; Pence.  So, I donated to both to    And to  which is trying to bring #RankedChoiceVoting to MA:
If you are progressive and disappointed with #Biden, ask:  -which President will respect our collective power to organize?  -which President can we more likely influence?  -which Judicial appointments will honor equal rights?  -which administration would have most accountability?
Biden is a Republican.
Biden lays a trap for Trump in picking Harris
Agreed, Biden should not. No upside. Let trump et. al rage and sputter and whine and yell. The more he does the more unhinged, unstable, erratic, petty, mean, and frankly delusional, trump appears.
My only hope is that if the debates go on, every time Trump or Pence say anything that we know to be pure BS, Biden or Harris just say "roll the tape" and fact check them in real time. They
Cancel Culture is cancelling statues because they represent men who owned slaves, but is okay with Biden and Kamala who’s family owned slaves.
I too am upset not to have  on the ticket. But her spot was at the top of the ticket. I have already processed my disappointment. Knowing she has Biden’s ear &amp; her policies will be championed is enough. And you know what is even more important? Being 💯for Biden!
Trumps attacks on Harris will backfire. Harris is more popular among Republicans than Biden is and attacking a female candidate in the manner he has will alienate the rest of the suburban female voters who support him and Kamala fights back hard.
Most of the “Kamala is the safe pick” stories I’ve read don’t mention a thing about her policy ideas (who has any idea what those are? Or even really cares?). It’s all “she’s a pick who won’t lose Biden suburban white votes”
Im so happy Biden chose
Also! She’s actually left of Biden on weed and a bunch of other things! She’s the 2nd most progressive senator and votes with Bernie 93% of the time. This is a win for progressives. She’s been smeared her whole career, as almost all women in politics have.
imma feel real dirty voting for Biden and Harris but this mf pedo cheeto needa get the fuck outta office 🤦🏽‍♂️

We live in Maine’s 1st district which is safe blue anyway. I’m not voting for Biden. I will never vote for an abuser.
We could have had a Sanders/Abrams ticket but instead we have a Biden/Harris and consequently will lose in November. Very left leaning people won’t compromise their vote, for better or worse. Though I’ll vote for Biden begrudgingly, I can’t really blame them.
Wall Street can’t wait for Kamala to push Biden into taxing trading transactions!
Biden people don’t do boats. They’re into lockstep.
If Biden claims he is Catholic publicly and uses it in his campaign and stand against the moral teachings of the church he should be criticized.  I’m not aware that Trump has voice belonging to any denomination.
We are going to see what happens after Biden wins.  I'm predicting the Baby Steps approach so as not to offend their corporate donors.  End Citizens United, enact term limits, reign in the Military Industrial Complex and the Political Industrial Complex

Joe Biden is making his first appearance with newly chosen running mate Kamala Harris on Wednesday
the United States in the event of Biden's death. We are in the middle of a financial crisis which requires the most competent business people, not these lame, insipid politicians.
Electing Biden is the first step toward ANY leftward movement and without it we are lost. There was no way to rocket from Trump that far to the left, this country just isn’t there, the majority want stability after experiencing blowing up the system.
Joe Biden is Catholic. And he also thinks that the guy in the robes with the funny hat in the front of the church is God.
The best argument for Harris on CJ is she seems to have changed her positions but like Biden she chose the strategy of insisting that no, she's actually been consistent and good the entire time. Unlike someone like Gillibrand who admitted that her past was bad.
I don't see a world in which Biden signs something to deny my ability to get healthcare, or to allow jobs to fire me for who I am. Trump has done one already. I'm certain he would do the other. In more ways than one, I'm voting for my life.
leave that Trump/Biden poll up for awhile today...after 5pm please...that’s when most Trump supporters will answer...they can’t right now...they’re working.
Kamala Harris will be the first Woman and Woman of color as USA President if Biden wins.  He probably won't remember where the White House 🏡 is located.  Happy a native Oaklander is on the ticket.  Maybe she can make Oakland safe again
Wow, your hate for Trump is really strong today. If you think so highly of Biden, you shouldn’t have any problem seeing him in a debate with Trump. That shouldn’t even be a contest, right? Don’t you want to show the world what a great candidate he is?
a SLAY QUEEN and KING who are backing BIDEN/HARRIS in 2020!  This absolutely isn’t a damning indictment of the state of American electoral politics!
Beware the ‘Secret Biden / Harris Voters’; they’re out there despite the polls.
Let me help you with this: Racist white women will be voting for me. They are scared of black people and thrilled that I am willing to be openly racist and not let black people invade their neighborhood. Biden picked Senator Harris, black. Corey Booker is also black, be afraid!
NPR is actually lying  If reelected, Trump will forgive any need to repay  Would Biden demand repayment?  Trump had to do an Executive Order, because congress wouldn't DO THEIR JOB  So don't look to NPR for news, it's propaganda for DNC
In the same world where men can get pregnant and Biden has all his faculties.
Excitement is building from this morning's Best PR Headline thus far: "National Banana Split Day is just two weeks away!" Everybody and his uncle is tweeting about Biden's VP pick, but remember you read about banana splits here first.
You can’t put Kamala and Biden into a simple hoodie romance, it is far more complicated than that and to be honest you are demeaning the suffering the black community has gone through of at least 40 years of their reign including mass incarceration, do better
So why are we taken down statues? If symbolism matters why do we have both Biden and Kamala slave owners? Why not have someone who is #ADOS  that would truly send a messages
Biden’s family were also slave owners and I’m sure the media would’ve tracked down on Trump and Pence by now, but I can’t find anything online about it. So yeah, if symbolism matters why take down statues? Why have 2 people who’s family owned slaves? Why not have an actual #ADOS

Oh no!  I was going to vote for Biden and Harris but your compelling propaganda has completely swayed me to vote for the guy who wrecked the economy, cut taxes for billionaires, played down a pandemic as a hoax costing countless jobs and lives, and steals from charities!
Well yo do have one thing right Harris/Biden with be running the country come January so that’s fine by me
Me too! I understand the Biden perspective much better since I've been diagnosed with leukemia. I'm grateful for all the good work they did with the ACA. Trump undermined it, Biden/Harris will grow it.
Look at the Biden/Harris healthcare platform. It's moving in the direction you want. It wasn't easy to get the ACA, we shouldn't throw it away, when we can grow it and make it better.
Y’all preach equality then you get on here give the people a false narrative. Kamala Harris was just calling joe Biden a racist during debates. Now you on here supporting Jb bringing in her for minority votes. Man all y’all niggas deep state lmao.
This is the weakest and most corrupt ticket that the Dems have ever put up.  They're going to get crushed.
Biden/Harris have an extremely progressive social platform, the most progressive Democratic platform ever. Be happy. Be hopeful.
Joe Biden probably thought he could be the Vice President too. 😂
Biden announces Harris and  shits his pants. Mother Karen had to spank him! 🤣👏🏻 #BidenHarris2020 #PenceShitHisPants
lol a Never-Trumper acquaintance moping that Biden didn't pick Condoleezza Rice as VP  like after the GOP set itself on fire, somehow they're entitled to have somebody else's party put their refugees in places of power as a show of "fairness"?  what world, man? what world.
#Biden selects Senator #KamalaHarris as his running mate in the 2020 #PresidentialElection.   #Maine voters react to the news:  #WMTW
What frustrates me is the people who excitedly voted for the Obama/Biden ticket that will now not support Joe in 2020. That’s so hypocritical and stupid given what’s at stake this election. Voting for a candidate is voting for more than just a position they’re running for.
Kamala Harris' ex suggests she 'politely decline' if asked to be Biden's VP  via
Hopefully Biden will be a one term transitional president while Progressives build their base to win in '24
The Democratic presidential candidate embraces a former primary rival and makes history by selecting the first Black woman to run on a major party’s presidential ticket.
Regarding Harris as the VP pick: Yes it is entirely obnoxious that the DNC/Biden Puppets chose a COP after months of BLM protests. However- I think this is actually an inception of the social rubber band effect... (1/2)
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was “a little surprised” that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, had selected Kamala Harris as his running mate.

She's a prosecutor. It's either Biden/Harris or 4 more years of Trump. Not voting for Biden/Harris IS a vote for trump.

How it happened: Biden’s handlers told him who to pick.  They even scripted out his phone call to the empty headed moron to ask her. Disingenuous garbage.

Biden is another old white man who is seemingly getting dementia and has sexual assault concerns. I’ll vote for him and hate it because there’s no other logical choice,  but I think kamala is more the dems vision.

if you want to make life better for people that aren’t privileged white men then we need to dismantle the 2 year party system. and that starts with not giving biden or trump your support
BREAKING: Wikileaks Posts 137 Documents on Kamala Harris Hours After She Is Named Joe Biden's Running Mate  via
It occurred to me last week that if Biden wins, we will have formed the “Obama Era” just like GHW Bush winning confirmed the Reagan Era.
An interesting note is that while I didn't vote Trump in 2016, my parents did. This time, I wanted Warren for VP and they wanted Kamala. They can't wait to get a Biden-Harris bumper sticker for their car; something they've never done before.
I believe that Joe Biden Kamala Harris 2020 will get a 5 point bump prior to the convention!
please tell me I didn’t hear you on Tucker saying you would vote for Biden if not for the dog whistles!
Give me a break. There’s nothing we haven’t heard before. What I mean is if it hasn’t hurt Biden already, it’s not going to damage him now.
I really think that’s what’s gonna happen. Biden just doesn’t seem “all there” anymore.
why aren’t we allowed to criticize the shitty option the democratic party gave us? when ARE we allowed to criticize her or biden?
This is 100% the truth. The same way Biden brought in Sanders supporters to form platform ideas after a tough primary. Biden just seems a decent person who is open to growth and change. It’s quite a contrast...
Kamala Harris, whom expected Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Tuesday as his running mate, said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of sexual assault.  “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage”
so with a Biden/Harris ticket I’m curious on your thoughts about the possibility of the legalization of cannabis? Ty...
It does not matter who is VP. Should Biden win, there will be a team of Obamettes in the White House making all decisions. Neither Biden nor Harris will be anything but window dressing. We, as a nation, are going to spend an extraordinary amount of time and energy uselessly. DJT!
Biden-Harris is a great ticket for America. Excited for Kamala Harris because she's very qualified. I'm a pre-Trump conservative who wants to save our democracy with any ally willing to help good people and she carries that human spirit into every battle.
We have to win before anything else matters. And I believe Biden wants to do right.  Are you happy to let Trump’s people stay where they are?

Joe Biden owes Jim Clyburn so much. #Maddow
Eric Trump Used Robin Williams To Attack Joe Biden? Oh Hell No

President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have won their parties’ presidential primaries in Connecticut Tuesday:
It’s very important to Distinguish that Kamala is not African American, she is Indian and Jamaican, most importantly she is not #Ados and even more important, both Biden and Kamala Harris Family all owned African American Slaves! Nice pick America 😡
President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden have won their parties’ presidential primaries in Connecticut Tuesday:
I really like her but honestly I want Biden to put her in charge of a voter suppression task force or something. Head of the FEC?
Rove is correct. Keep it about Biden #Hannity
It's not a contract. But baptism and his progression through the sacraments confers certain rights. Biden can have a Catholic burial, for example. Chief among them, however, is that the theology of baptism means no dude on the internet gets to say you aren't a Catholic.
Even if Tobin could excommunicate Biden for any of this—which is absurd—Tobin is the bishop of RHODE ISLAND. Meanwhile, upright Catholic that you are, you deny the Pope is the Pope. Beware, the bishop of Borneo is gonna excommunicate you!
Now that the #Veepstakes is over, let’s play another favorite game: “who will  appoint you fill the remainder of  senate term?”
It’s true, and also she didn’t really bring a regional constituency (Kamala doesn’t either tho) and hasn’t won a contested election and didn’t really seem to try to get the job. She didn’t have the experience &amp; I can’t imagine she would have wanted to work with Biden
“Not long ago, Kamala Harris called Joe Biden a racist and asked for an apology she never received.”  Fact: Harris explicitly did not call Biden racist but she did criticize him during a debate last year for talking about working with two segregationist senators.
Biden doesn’t have dementia and neither does Kamala get a grip
I am psyched to see her meet the moment and shine.  She will appeal to a lot of voters who need inspiration. She is the inspiration to Biden’s empathy.  I am old. I don’t need inspiration just competence, ethics, and integrity.
It’s time. Game on. Enough.  Joe Biden VP pick: Sen. Kamala Harris
I thought the far left didn’t like her because she was a prosecutor? And Biden worked for someone who wasn’t born in Hawaii!!!
the fact that liberals are literally slandering biden like do you want trump again i don’t understand
Everyone POTUS candidate picks someone different from him or her self. As did Biden. It will be a big problems for Rs in terms of her race and gender. And ads will be ok with the pick.

Biden is never getting on a stage with Trump. Something will prevent it.
Purity tests SUCK. Read some history: Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act. Nixon created the EPA. You think Biden/Harris won't seize the moment? You just want to label people in your mind -- it's regressive, and ultimately has more in common with racism and fascism. Do better. 🇺🇸
So wait a minute she basically believes joe Biden is guilty but jumps on his ticket . It’s a disgrace, and shameful

Everyone saying “Elizabeth Warren hedged her bets &amp; got nothing in return” are completely ignoring:  a) how much of Warren’s agenda Biden has already adopted   b) other positions like Treasury Sec that Warren may want  c) maybe what Warren really wants is to beat Trump   #warren
They’d prefer it wasn’t even Biden as the nominee.

nah forreal, tho. biden really looked us in our faces while fighting for police/prison abolishment and picked the prison industrial goddess??? like, neither side is even trying anymore
I couldn’t be happier. Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party
It is a life and death choice. We vote for Trump who’s Covid response has killed thousands and will continue to kill us or Biden who will follow the science.
Honestly I thought Biden would pick an inanimate carbon rod. Or at the very least Amy Klobaucher.
Melanie is just a wife and mother. She didn’t run for anything. Therefore the way she chose to advance her career is irrelevant. Not true for Kamala Harris, who is set up to 25th Amendment Joe Biden in the first 100 days. 100 hours?
Without question; Biden will serve 2-2.5 years then make way for whoever his running mate would have been

The Dow dropped faster on the news of Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris,  than Kamala would drop to her knees. Which is pretty pretty fast.
Naturally, in 2020, the Dems nominate a sexual harasser and accused rapist for president, and a prosecutor whose spent her career (along with Biden) upholding the prison industrial complex for VP.   Cool.
I think trump is the Great Unifier and Biden will be the vehicle.
Kamala Harris supported joe Biden’s sexual accusers
She supported joe Biden’s sexual accusers !

Excommunication can indeed be appealed. Theologically, an unjust excommunication doesn't exist. In any case, Biden hasn't been excommunication; the idea is absolutely absurd. These people wandered off the set of Warrior Nun.

No surprise-trump’s childish name calling &amp; mean spirited attacks on Biden and Harris who will takes us to a better place after we vote November 3rd. “Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy ride”- Betty Davis, ‘All About Eve’. #BidenHarris2020 #vote
if biden got g checked like this on race  by her and accepted to open up the ticket given the way politicians hold grudges this is a slow step to no more 70 year old white dude presidents
Excommunicated individuals do not become "non-Catholics." The are prohibited from the sacraments and much else, but their baptism is not undone.  Biden has in any case not been excommunicated. But bishops can excommunicate, and various actions can excommunicate you automatically.
Is everyone out there surprised at the Harris VP pick as Biden was ?
Kamala doesn't mind getting that runner up prize as long as Biden sniffs her hair and she can call him 'daddy'. 👀👀👀🤡🤡🤡😆😆😆 #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden
I’m looking forward to watching Biden pinch Kamalas ass
Allow me to suggest that Noam Chomsky has borrowed the “wart the hockey” Biden theory from  family
It’s sad that Biden can read?  You guys really have set a low bar. Perhaps the lowest bar ever. Only Donnie could maintain and slide his graceful body under that bar.
Trump campaign blasts ‘phony’ Kamala Harris in ad, says Biden pick reflects ‘extreme agenda’  #FoxNews- the word to describe Is “”” SOCIALIST””””””
Ah yes, "Tough On Crime" "You ain't Black" Biden calling others out on white supremacy.
And what if she answers "no?"   Does that mean people like Biden aren't allowed to evolve?
Kamala Harris, Biden's radical VP pick signals bad news for American workers, economic recovery  #FoxBusiness- sorry Biden you lost my vote- I’ll be dammed to vote for a socialist as your running mate. Biden you a,so are embracing Sanders.
I like her for the most part! I don’t know how I feel about how we she consider criminals like the Boston bomber being able to vote. Or her being on Joe Biden’s side - when she also said she believed the victims of his abuse. She’s fiery and compelling tv for sure🤷‍♂️
Biden got a his token black VP. Choo choo the Dementia train is leaving the station. All the BLM and Antifa can get behind that I bet. Biden's 'roaches' as they call them *respectively* #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris #Biden #Kamala #doodoobrownkamalasmealticket
I'm really excited about the Biden Harris ticket! Can I vote yet? I'd mail it in tomorrow to make sure it gets there on time...
Joe Biden was Catholic enough for this moron in 2012, but after Biden's son died now he's not Catholic enough.  And they wonder why no one under 67 comes to mass.
I love Biden. He's awesome. He's got a stutter. You'll get used to it.
by that logic a vote for third party is also a vote for biden so you’re fucking welcome
Leaving aside his sincerity, which you obviously doubt, Biden is a baptized Catholic. Catholic baptism creates an irreversible, ontological change. As a bishop you are obligated to understand that and not deny it. Don't you have a theology degree?
Congrats to the next Vice President of the United States! Joe Biden has made the right choice. Sending you all our support!
If learning Chinese would guarantee that Biden/Harris wins the WH, I would start studying Chinese now. Trump is a moron.

Ralph, do you really think Biden made this decision? Pretty certain the puppet masters of the Democratic Party made it for him.
Check it out, Zach: remember Harris calling out Biden on her own experience w school busing? This was a pick about reconciliation, about learning, about excellence rising to the challenge. So sorry if you don't get that. 🇺🇸

I contributed to Biden in exchange for advance notice of his pick.  Exactly five seconds before. But it felt so good.
Bright side: Biden and Kamala have proven that they can be bullied into more progressive stances if it suits them
I'm so happy and excited too Cher..Kamala was my choice from the start!!#Biden/Harris
We now have a coalition of moderate Republicans, corporate Democrats, miscellaneous Democrats &amp; lndependents who just want Trump out, and progressives who have to join in and want to push policies left. It's a curious party, but Biden &amp; Harris absolutely have to win to save us.
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Kamala may not be my first choice but you can BET i’m voting Biden. The election isn’t about the “perfect candidate” it’s about choosing the person who will take the country forwards, not backwards.
Are you aware of the horrendous things Joe Biden has said and done to people of color?
Really disappointed. Harris has got as many skeletons in her closet as Susan Rice. Rice's closet has virtually been cleaned out by Congress. Will still vote for Joe Biden.
To that end, I feel like Biden and Harris are much more impressionable than our current president. Meaning that the American people have a better chance of getting their wants and voices heard.
Biden/Harris. I'm on board!
Knew Biden was gonna pick Kamala and it still is painful
Biden committed to choosing a woman, and there was significant pressure to choose a woman of color. He had no choice. Kamala was the most popular and powerful VP candidate that qualified and brought geographic distribution -- California. Biden-Harris is a strong team.
Not happy about the forecast for Second Amendment rights, but otherwise I’m fine with Biden/Harris.
Please enjoy if you like slurred speech lies and words pronounced incorrectly naw i'll be enjoying Biden/ Harris 2020 news for real enjoyment
This actually works in their favor if they approach as Biden wanting those around him to challenge his views and give him honest opinions.

If the VP is meant to be an attack dog, you couldn’t ask for much better than Kamala. She provides energy and charisma Biden needs. I would have preferred Duckworth, who had less baggage, but that’s how elections go.
Funny I was discussing the Maya Rudolph casting last night, and it only enhanced her candidacy. Last summer in Quebec City, a Canadian told  &amp; me that a Biden Harris ticket was perfect &amp; would win. I know you are happy too.

Oops...
I had grown to like Biden's weird font, that almost looks like it should be used for a comedy movie poster or a child's toy. I think this new one is a downgrade.
So,  has announced his VP. The most important thing that means is a new logo. And unlike most presidential campaigns, Biden actually slightly changed it, instead of just adding his VP's name in the same font. The font is now simultaneously less sharp and less fat.
Duke, I’m already making room on my lawn for both a Biden/Harris sign and a Susan Collins sign.
Seriously pardon the pun, I understand you hate Trump and that’s fine but you can’t be excited for Joe Biden ! He will just be a puppet to the party and Kamala is lucky if she doesn’t get her office taken away by Pelosi and Schumer.
This dynamic duo is going to be awesome... who’s ready for the first BIDEN-HARRIS insta live grilled cheese sandwich session? #JoeBiden #mepolitics
I just donated to Biden and Harris!
Shoot. I really had hoped Biden would pick a progressive veep.
the woman who spent her career locking up black men, while giving sanctuary cities to illegal immigrants.   I guess it’s fitting, since Joe Biden helped write the 1994 crime bill that separated black fathers from their families.
I ❤️ when privileged, progressive people complain about the democratic ticket. We don’t have time for your shit right now. Biden/Harris 2020 because having another four years of a dangerous president is not worth putting to chance. Get out of your bubble.

Biden was on the speaker list before being named VP. So was Kaine.
I know this isn’t fair to Susan Rice, but if she is Biden’s VP pick and we have to deal with conservatives relitigating Benghazi AGAIN, I will scream.
Biden may make some gestures to lessen the pain of some means-tested “deserving poor” but will always ensure that the state always has plenty more pain and suffering in the pipeline and will do nothing to slow it.
Yay! Biden’s VP will be in great hands. Karine has great energy and is brilliant.
I was very discouraged last week, but I now have some hope. I think there are little signs, like this, that, taken together, signal EW may be Biden’s VP choice. Politicians of  caliber come along once in a century; we desperately need her now.
So I’m guessing Kamala Harris will be Biden’s pick for AG then.

I’ll save you the effort:  Trans girls, if they’re on puberty blockers, should be able to compete on girls’ teams. Trans boys should also get to compete with boys.   So save your OMG IF YOU ELECT BIDEN SCARY TRANS ARE GONNA…DO GOOD AT SHOTPUT!
It may be wishful thinking but this is what I’ve been thinking as well. Whitmer needed to be talked up for balance purposes and to deflect from the widely circulating belief (untrue) that Biden had committed to  choosing a WOC.
We know damn well that Biden has decided on his pick.  We’re now in the rollout orchestration phase.
Biden winning would be extremely catastrophic to the black community
Yep! So many people commentating right now were kids or not paying attention during the 08 election.  Plain was chosen to poach women voters who were sore about Hillary. Repubs concern trolled about sexism, Dems actually cared a lot.  Biden was SO CAREFUL in the debates
Biden is low-key doing the reality TV gig better than Trump ever has.   “The Vice Presidential candidate I have chosen is…  …  …going to be revealed right after the break.”
Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, said that “[n]o president has been worse for our environment or our nation’s public health” than the current one.
Do a little more research on biden first. Such as crime bill, segregation, busing and his racist remarks the past week then get back to me
The only thing better than Biden picking Sally Yeats as his Veep would be Lisa Page.  I shit you not.
This should be trotted out every time they lay into a Biden gaffe.
Today I’d say Biden has the inside track on Arizona and Florida.
Yes.  The EPA rollbacks have to be corrected as soon as Biden wins. But it will be more difficult if mining and drilling and fracking projects are in motion.  How can they do so much damage every day?  It's mind-boggling and discouraging.  Can't fight it without lots of money.
Biden is an American patriot unlike you and your father.
Lyssa says to vote because people are pointing out that her recommendations cost $1000's, if not more. Vote for who? Biden who said he'd veto M4A?  I swear this woman is next in line right after Musk.
Nothing of substance yet. We don’t even know the person the Secret Service took down was yet. My guess is a Bernie or Biden supporter.
“Biden’s V.P. Pick Is Said to Be Imminent,” ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ ⁦
There's buzz inside the beltway right now.  Biden is close.
Market is discounting a Biden victory, IMO.
I'm not worried about the debates.  FL will always be in play but it's better for Biden than North Carolina is.
I've been studying the Presidential Electoral Map and I discovered an inescapable truth for POTUS:   If you're spotting Biden CA, IL and NY, there are only so many ways to win.  And it isn't pretty for you.
Oh man if RASMUSSEN has Biden only down one in NC, he must be up by like four or five.
Asking if you’ll still vote for Biden if he picks ______ for Veep is like asking if you’ll still get up tomorrow to go to work if it’s cloudy.
You guys maybe Biden counts Mayor Pete as a lady you think so?
Joe Biden’s Driving.
Forget Biden’s VP pick, MY NEW PATIO is imminent!! (Hopefully it won’t keep being delayed like the V.P. announcement!)
The only true thing about Joe Biden is that he’s a Scorpio from Delaware. ♏️♏️♏️♏️♏️
Apparently we’re all watching arrivals in Delaware for hints of Biden’s VP.  Well, looks like he’s going with either Janet Mills or Sara Gideon. #mepolitics 😜
Hmmm. So what do we call Trump’s spying on the Biden campaign?
Just IMAGINE what would happen on the right if Biden says this. Well I guess you don’t have to imagine it because he probably does think it’s true. We are so doomed lololol
We owe African Americans and minorities a great deal, especially if Biden is a DNC choice. Put our hearts where our mouths are.
Whomever Biden chooses will be 1000% better than anyone in the trump administration.
Tempted to send this to my family... but I know they’ll reply that Biden isn’t with it either so why should it matter
Joe Biden? TOO OLD! Senile! Mistake prone! Can’t do the job!
"Show me your budget and I'll show you who you are." ---Joe Biden
Another gaffe! Now Biden stated the Spanish Flu ended World War II! Wow, that guy is losing it! . . . Oh wait, it wasn't Biden?
I don’t think Biden even knows what year it is tbh
Fox commentators would be experiencing brain aneurysms expressing their outrage if Biden said the 1917 pandemic ended the Second World War. Person. Women. Man. Camera. TV.
Joe biden you have shocked the nation
He’s still talking and still lying about how if Biden wins the market will crash. Then again on mail in voting, how it will to massive voter fraud. Then how Russia wants him to lose.  And he keeps calling it the China virus! #TrumpPlauge
WE WILL HAVE SUCH DEALS IF WE WIN THE ELECTION STOCKS WILL CRASH IF BIDEN WINS LIKE YOUVE NEVER SEEN THE ECONOMY WILL SOMEHOW BE WORSE THAN IT IS NOW YOUR HEALTHCARE WILL SUCK
Did he get word that Biden was ready to announce his choice?
Oh please stop doing this. We will vote for Joe Biden no matter who runs with him.
Biden has my support as well lots of good ideas and I’m sure he’ll pick a wonderful VP #StayTruBlue
Joe Biden on decadeslong friendship with John McCain: 'We're like two brothers'  via
I’m looking for some dump trump signs if someone knows how to get a hold of those also would like some Joe Biden signs
The Biden nomination exposed the two party system to be flawed, rigged and hopeless. Leaving a lot of Americans who know they have no freedom scared. They are marching in the streets out of desperstion for racial justice and radical change. (6)
So it appears Biden can ride a bike well and Trump can barely walk down a ramp, drink a bottle of water, figure out an umbrella, or walk the plane stairs without toilet paper in his shoes. Yet Biden is the sleepy one😂😂
Trump trying to paint Biden as mentally unfit a strategy that will cost Trump the election if Trump debates him. Biden will not only outperform these expectations but he will make Trump look completely unfit.
Jill Biden was seen there yesterday
Biden wants to defund the police.  Every woman in America should be scared to death of that.
It should be a pivotal week in the race for the White House, as we expect Joe Biden to unveil his running mate, and that person could be a historic choice:

Folks forget Joe Biden. He won’t be the nominee
“Women’s Group Warns Media Execs: Avoid Sexist, Racist Coverage of Biden’s V.P. Pick,” ⁦ | ⁦
Biden will soon be out as the nominee which is why he hasn’t chosen a vp. So who’s next in line? Sanders? Cuomo?  Loosely defined, that’s how liberals work.
Joe Biden says '10-15%' of Americans 'are just not very good people'
Not a chance
And  nephew isn’t getting his popcorn. Vote Biden.
Repeat after me, “there isn’t a Biden lead”
You can clearly see Biden's training wheels.

Every day I don’t think Herr Cheeto could prove himself more feckless he opens his mouth. via
it’s crazy how when it was Biden or Bernie the argument was: ‘ya gotta pick biden, he’ll be able to bring in the Moderates and Black vote.’ &amp; over the past 48 hours both moderates and black people have said they need Biden’s VP to fit to what they want or they won’t vote.
Schumer and Pelosi, who will be running  Biden, have pointed the way to which states will benefit under Biden.
I will vote Biden, but this is all a sinking ship. Our time has come and gone. Good riddance
I'm cautiously optimistic (although I realize that unless Biden runs away with this, November is going to get very messy)
He promised a scorched earth campaign if the GOP tried to drag up dirt on Hunter Biden.  Still waiting...
I agree Biden will won big and that Trump’s properties will be seized and Trump will eventually be sentenced💙
joe biden 🤮 🤢  VS Donald Trump 😎 💯   Joe Biden: Creepy af 😱  Pedophile 🔞  Old and senile 🤧  Racist ⚪ 🖕 ⚫   Donald Trump: Cool af 😎  Deported all the immigrants 🇲🇽 🔥  Beat the covid 19 💪 💊  Building the wall 🧱  MAGA!! 🧢
Oh sure. He was deeply conservative for decades. Kinda like Biden.
WTF I love Biden now
And Biden will also face disgusting opposition...
Biden bstter start putting money in NE for districts 1 and 2
Also, getting his campaign out from under sleazy Republican operatives. At the moment, especially with the Illinois signature shenanigans, it seems a nasty little play to hurt Joe Biden, not a serious effort to constructively add to the dialogue.
If it’s not Liz, #WarrenDemocrats will take a deep breath, roll up our sleeves, and work like hell to get the ticket elected to advance progressive change in this country as best we can. Just like we did with Biden.  But privately, we’ll be goddamn disappointed.
Agree with all these reasons why Warren *should* be the VP. I also think there’s good reason to believe Biden believes it, too:
Don’t be complacent. We have no room for error. We fight until Joe Biden is in the oval office cleaning up trump’s mess.
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday that he has subpoenaed the FBI to produce documents to his committee related to the Trump-Russia investigation.
And we now know China is actively working for Joe Biden's election.

President Josephine Biden
I think you’re giving them too much credit. I don’t think they’re smart enough to have a plan. Because if they were really smart, they would’ve picked a much better candidate than Joe Biden to begin with.
When the "Intelligence Community" finds that Russia interferes for Trump- It's confirmation.  When the "IC" finds China &amp; N. Korea back Biden... it is faulty chatter.
When Biden stepped into the VP job, Obama immediately granted him enormous power in overseeing the execution of the Recovery Act.  Biden knows he will need a powerful, morally-centered, and competent VP, even more than Obama did before. #WarrenForVP
Perhaps Junior, you don’t understand staged photo op. for example, Biden had posed with an upside down Bible in front of a church, that would definitely be one
as far as actual crimes, he is a developer in NYC dealing with all sort of unions, etc - at least he makes something and NYC is made out of his beautiful bldgs.  How about Biden, Clinton, and Obama to name a few - real criminal activities but the dems are a mafia at this point
Seltzer is a tool - Biden had "vigorous" activity by going on a bike ride and saying two words to a reporter.
Who is picking Biden”s VP for him?
Why not focus on Warren Democrats? Even if Biden lacks the courage to choose her, #WarrenDemocrats will be a major force in the party, with Liz as our standard bearer.
I endorse Biden. He will be fantastic.
I thought the #RIPKamala tag meant that Biden had chosen somebody other than Harris as a running mate, but 2020 just keeps on stealing from us...
Love your PSA’s girl🤣🤣keep em comin! BIDEN 2020🇺🇸👊🏽VOTING REPUBS AND TRUMP OUT NOV 3rd!
California Rep. Maxine Waters says Biden 'can't go home' without choosing a Black woman as his ru...  via  It will be Hillary. Biden doesn’t like being told who to pick. His first choose was Michelle Obama, smart &amp; a class lady.
How does Trump close the gap on Joe Biden? Pick Nikki Haley as his VP  via
Hi, millenial Biden staffer! At least Trumps tweets are really Trump! Hopefully your having Twitter ghostwritten for you is not emblanatic of how your presidency will go. Unfortunately, I think it is.
Trump is so nervous about the debates he cut his golf short. He thinks Biden is old however and the debates would highlight this. Joe Biden could be 100 and still be smarter than Trump and still get my vote. Raise ur hand if u think Biden destroys Trump🙋‍♂️
Is this a joke? No one, I repeat NO ONE, is excited for Joe Biden. I’m not convinced “Joe Biden” even exists as a self-aware entity.
Biden needs to make it clear to Putin that he’s going to see sanctions far worse than what Iran has been dealing with if he continues to fuck with western elections. And then he needs to make it happen when he’s sworn in. Russia’s economy is the same size as New York’s, crush it.
Is that why trump is on the golf course instead of church? Biden went to mass but you claim he's against god and will destroy the church
Of course. Joe Biden is a push over.  Pellosi is about as articulate as Biden. How do you become a Politician and not be able to form syllables
Joe Biden unsure if prosecuting Trump good for Democracy but will not stand in the way of his Justice department😂😂👊well played Joe.
I didn’t say lower taxes. I said appropriate taxes. The stuff isn’t free. Rethink priorities. Joe Biden says, don’t tell me what your priorities are. Show me your budget &amp;  I’ll tell you what your priorities are. I find it comical you think R’s are fiscally responsible.
I do remember that. We talk about it quite a bit around here. It seems like she really hurt his campaign in that moment. By the way, I love that you call her Liz. Never Biden.
Identify one lie in Biden's tweet.
