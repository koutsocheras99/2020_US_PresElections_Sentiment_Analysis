Biden's potential VP pick Katen Bess and Scientology...
I’d completely forgotten about these photos. The kids were so little and VP Biden was so patient with them. And with me, who felt like I had no idea what I was doing 🤷🏼‍♀️
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president  Wow so JOE BIDEN NEEDS to pick a woman!!  I think that would be a good thing but MY VOTE is NOT CONTINGENT on that!
What a prick. There are TWO Trump flags in my neighborhood. I give them dirty looks when I walk the dogs thankfully the Biden signs out number the flags by at least double.
HEY HEY HEY! my subaru is way cooler than joe biden. it has a sunroof and leather seats.  and it's not beholden to any corporate interest but the bank loan.
WE THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF ALL THE BS!               All these"BUSINESSMEN" S/B fired when Biden is elected in Nov! The GOP are acting EVIL!👿👎
Biden doesn’t need Fox.

Biden is 102 years old she should be!
Right—eye on the prize. It probably didn’t help that just as I left work one of my fellow respiratory therapist saw my Biden button on the inside of my work bag &amp; said—oh God, he’ll ruin our country. trump has it straightened out! This is an educated respiratory therapist!!😩
At this point  campaign ads should just be dumb Biden stuff followed by this gif. 😂
So I have my Biden sign in the yard..right. I come home from work, walking back up the driveway from getting the mail and some guy screams SOCIALIST out of his car window at me. There you go—trump’s America.
Oh. 💡why I may have been blocked. I made a comment that the white liberal women who say Biden shouldn’t pick Harris, but should pick Warren, reminded me of the white liberal women who wouldn’t vote for Obama and said Michelle was phony because “what Black woman spoke like that.”
Wouldn’t be great if the daily caller does better vetting than Biden..

DEMOCRATS encourage people to riot? Who sent the storm troopers to escalate the carnage in Portland? Not Obama. And not Biden. Not Pelosi. Not Schiff. Not Nadler. Specifically, WHICH democrats told the protestors to riot? I know: "a lot of people are saying".
I’m with you! Vote for Biden!!
If they vote for Biden they’re not paying attention and DUMB.
Here’s your boy biden:
The argument isn’t even about what voters think, it’s about what Biden’s ancient white friends think. It’s such a waste of breathe and effort.
Unironically will not vote for Biden if this is his VP pick
Can I see those stats bc I just saw Biden worth 9 million ?
Dr. Alveda King:  The left will "grab at any opportunity" to twist an occasion like the funeral of #JohnLewis into "a political moment."  #Obama #Biden #filibuster
Trump can’t get out his own way. This election should have been in the bag for him. I’d be livid if he was my candidate. Also Biden doesn’t get a pass but Trump is just that horrible that folks would vote for a keg of beer rather than him.
Wouldn’t it be awesome if Biden announces President Obama as his VP pick?
I'm just a simple man with a simple question.  What did Biden know and when did he know it?  This is a trick question. Go.
Please talk to your BFF tRump about attempting to destroy our election because he is trailing badly in the polls. I think some flooding can wait until Biden is in the White House.
KEEP THE FAITH ‼️‼️  HOLD ONTO HOPE ‼️‼️  WE WON’T ALLOW A BIDEN PRESIDENCY  Joe Biden lead in battleground states have dwindled since the past two weeks.   Trump only down +2 points in Pennsylvania ‼️‼️  #trump #biden
Who is Biden?
Joy. I’m not sure where you’re going with encouraging negative noise around Biden but I’d be careful if I were you. This isn’t the year sweetie. Biden is doing just fine cut the crap. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Sorry Mr Biden..my family is good where we are..thanks.  #4MoreYears  #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
The right doesn’t have a monopoly on what it means to be an American.  Nor do soldiers.  Thank you for your service. It gives me the freedom to support Joe Biden and speak against systematic racism.

Hahaha! “Goal post shift” Cool pivot. Must’ve learned it from Joe Biden. “Great to be here at this community center.” “Oh, that’s a joke. It’s look like the one I worked at 60 years ago”
No, we're talking about Joe Biden not trump and when he's voted out of office the indictment will follow. Thank you buh bye 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Biden’s a pedophile I guess you support that huh?
Dems would rather elect Biden, regardless of his racist views than re-elect Trump, who’s never proven racism! Go figure.
There's an enormous disconnect bordering on cognitive dissonance between one of the major primary progressive/left issue of $ in politics, Biden's corp connections, the Dem response to the pandemic exposed crises, Biden's platform and the prospective VP impact on policy.
A more apt comparison is with Bernie, who's older but very sharp and fit. (Sigh.) And Biden never was very sharp.
Even at the risk of inviting further scrutiny on the Biden family record when it comes to corruption

Romney is a joke. Typical establishment who will flip flop on issues for votes. No wonder he’ll endorse Biden who does the same.
Wow two establishment politicians who flip flop on issues for votes...    Seems reasonable that Romney would endorse Biden.
Has to be Kamala, nothing against other contenders. Ready on day 1. Knowledgeable on both domestic and foreign issues. Effective campaigner. Proven. Inspiring. #KHive energy. Suppose Biden can't serve early in term - who do we want as Commander in Chief? #BidenHarris wins in Nov.
But John Roberts will swear in Biden on Jan 20th  And then the Military does what Joe says
Guess who I want VP Biden to choose for his VP? The other  candidates are great leaders and would be great VPs.. BUT Senator Harris checks all the boxes for me. Biden/Harris 2020! #BidenHarris2020 #changeagent #VoteBlue
Biden and Obama knew about Epstein and Clinton.  Sorry.  🤷🏼‍♂️worse then Trump. No contest.
Yea.  Again. Biden is a creepy kid toucher.  That takes precedence as morally unsound over trumps being recorded when he wasn’t aware.
Ahhh.  Got it now.  Geee thanks for helping me out.  Lol. What a 🤡 you are.  I got all day.  Keep deflecting from creepy puppet Biden.  Speaking of which.  He can use you on his panel considering his cognitive decline.  Oh.  Cognitive...I’ll dumb it down😘
Wait so white men are trying to dissuade Biden from picking a black woman in favor of... another black woman?
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I know it's just one poll, but people should be prepared for this thing to get tighter as the election gets closer. It's nothing against Biden, nor is it saying Trump is doing something well, but that's just how it always goes. Polls always tighten up as time ticks away.
Lots of people are speculating about Biden's VP pick. Its the hot media clickbait story of the hour. But, as many have pointed out, this take from Politico, which has been echoed by other publication and (mostly white male) pundits is deeply problematic &amp; offensive.
if the liberal agenda is to elect biden and promptly follow with electing the reincarnation of john mccain, he’s right  somehow i suspect that’s not most liberals’ agenda
they may want biden elected but they certainly don’t want any real progressive policies to ever come into effect
I disagree. ANY change on Trump's part would signal chao. Trading reliable white male Pence for brown, female, openly ambitious Haley would infuriate Trump's base, which is racist &amp; misogynist. This would nail Biden's reelection no matter who his VP is. Pure media fantasy.
My random points are things I fear about Biden. That’s all.  Communism.  The behavior from the rioters in Portland.. separate from the protestors.  The destruction of the nuclear family talk.  All of it.
In 2016 when Trump was running.  It caught my interest because he is different. I don’t agree w all he does but I said, maybe as a result of Trump a Phoenix will rise from the ashes and be what America needs.  I’m not really MAGA as much as scared of what’s attached to Biden
Joe Biden, brainless zombie for president.
So funny story. I didn’t vote for Trump.  Done a lot of research and this is where I currently stand because Biden is a puppet. A racist and creepy with children. Funny you are so on board with him.

Trump is bringing down the largest underage child sex trafficking ring as we speak.  Obama and Biden were aware as evidenced by Muellers knowledge and chose to do nothing.
But ARE you horny for young Biden?
Please.  KAMALA IS THE ONE!  A Biden/Harris campaign is unbeatable and the anecdote to the poison trump has injected through the veins of America! It’s time to start healing and rebuilding. Together. #BidenHarris2020
Rep. Clyburn  said Joe Biden  needs a VP with #passion , that's all you need to know. Kamala Harris has enough passion to share with all of us. I don't know how anyone can disagree with that statement. But of course you will always have #haters  #RidinWithBiden2020
No tests but deaths.when are you going to figure this out. This is pretty black and white.And mail in ballots and absentee are the same! Biden might have the beginning of dementia but he still is ten fold smarter than  Make America Honest Again and vote
It's A Young Joe Biden (Unisex Black Tank) that's priced at 25 dollars
I would like to see Biden pick Susan Rice as the VP and make Harris our AG. #BidenRiceIn2020 #AmericaWakeUp
Biden knows he’s a transition piece. I think he’s ok with that.
Should Biden pick a black woman as his running mate is a question people are struggling with. Just to ask the question is insulting to black people as a whole. Black women are qualified and strong enough to lead, so we will see if Biden is brave enough to choose quality.
That’s what Biden is. He’s first. What comes second in that model?
I don’t see it as a threat to Bidens chances. Biden brings in the old white dudes. She shores up the other demographics. Are voters really turned off by ambitious VPs?
I can see it already being a problem. If a state can't call it on election night because there waiting to count mail in ballots &amp; comes down to that one state or maybe two states. No news station can call the Presidential election that night. 45 will explode. Biden must win big!!
And you know this how, sine Biden is playing his cards close to his chest?
No one cares about that shit. Given Biden's age, I'm more concerned with who you're setting up for the future. Politically she's not strong — she has no electoral experience &amp; we have no idea how she'd perform as a candidate.
I don't think anyone knows who Biden will pick &amp; the media is just throwing shit out to see what sticks. Rice is certainly credible &amp; given the nature of the campaign this year, she won't hurt it, but she would be a weak pick for the future.
And that is why we need a real leader, Trump is a liar and a Natiinal disgrace. We had 4 years of crazy don't need another 4.   Biden is the way to go, just look how he handled this pandemic....oh wait he didn't. He passed  it off  per usual. #NobodyLikesTrump
How does she balance the ticket ideologically? She is probably a a tad more progressive than Biden, but Harris is one of the most progressive members of the Senate. And let's give the idea that Republicans will "use" these phony narratives — they'll invent something for anyone.
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots
WTF! An American died every 60 seconds yesterday &amp; all despicable  can whine about is mail-in voting? If he was the popular one...if his administration was such a F-ING success...then why is he whining about how the ballots are cast!?
Henry Olsen owe Joe Biden an apology,Trump did try to delay the election.
Ohio will be blue this year. Former (as of yesterday) Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder handed Ohio to Biden with his arrest last week for taking $61 million in bribes to ram through HB6, to bail out coal &amp; nuclear &amp; kill green energy. Everyone hated it! Now they're reminded!
Donald Trump ... Joe Biden .. both complete losers along with the rest of that trash ... sorry if I dont pick a side but why the fuck would I ?  Give me better America ! .. you can argue "Your guy" all you want .. with someone else who gives a fuck ..

I'd like one Leftists Liberal Biden supporter to explain to me how  ruined the economy? #waiting
What is the Matrix? Control.  Turning human beings into batteries for power to run the system. Biden 2020
I ignore them all. There is one right choice. I believe Biden will make it, but I’ll wait to find out.
There is no way a 14 year old girl is emotionally equipped to handle a sexual relationship.
Biden is a chump who uses tax dollars as outsourcing bribes. When not bribing he's extorting ally nations defense funds to fire people he doesn't like.
And he never tried in those 8years. Just like 99% of the shit Biden spews about doing neither he not Obama attempted to enact a single time. Biden only pushed racist legislation and said desegregation is going to make everywhere an “urban jungle”.  Nothing to see here.
Duckworth would mirror Biden's personal brand in that they're both people who have suffered great personal losses, but remain committed to and caring of other people.
Joe Biden support is just as toxic as Trump support. Only in a time like this white liberals can down talk great black leaders. Because y’all Biden Bros let that old white racist fool go on The Breakfast Club and talk shit so Bill Clinton took that same risk🤷🏾‍♂️
Do NOT believe Biden's Florida numbers
Biden would be wise to just abandon GA, OH, NC, and FL. He wont win them. Pour all your resources into WI, MI, PA, and AZ. Flood the airwaves, massive spending, and pick Klob as VP (but the campaign wont do that).

Doesn’t mean I will always stand here.  And if and when more comes out I have the ability to change my stance.  It’s called objectivity. Trump is guilty of a lot I’m sure.  But I don’t want puppet Biden and what’s attached to him.  That’s the driving force behind my stance. 🇺🇸
agreed, but the energy for Biden is what gives me hope (as opposed to 4 years ago)
Yes, but the effectiveness of the Dem response changes.  If it were Bernie, he'd go "Yes, and...?" and the DNC would scramble and look stupid claiming that wasn't what he meant.  Since it's Biden, they all just point and laugh.
That's what I thought when I first heard her mention it. But she called him Mr. Trump. Whoever she is she's a witness that was there.
How can Biden embrace them? He had Dementia
Isn’t Biden both and useless? 40 years in office he’s done nothing
What about the women that spoke out about biden assaulting them? I guess it's only when phony allegations like ms Ford with Kavanagh?  What happened to believe all women?
Dude if your talking Obummer? He was selling us out to Iran &amp; China. Which Biden will continue. Nothing he did mattered to US. Least Trump is making America first in all the fields across the board. Go back under your rock &amp; read something besides CNN $ WaPo/Times
Might as well use the constitution one more time before China gets Biden in to make America made in China.
Not sure if keeping pedo Clinton secret and Biden also knowing along with Muellar qualifies as “pales in comparison”. But you go with that.
Let's not forget calling Biden a rapist. Doxxing a union rep and making death threats. Calling Hillary a corporate whore. And the list goes on and on. Now they're mad people are calling them on their shit.
Right! You think corruptions a part of that ideal? Maybe you should do a lil researching of that topic pertaining to Biden &amp; son to China, Ukraine, etc. &amp; that goes for MANY Dem leaders like Pelosi, Schiff, Romney, etc &amp; how they launder their money to hide thru LLCs &amp; fake co.s
It's always fun to show how Obama Biden took us out of the Bush recession and into the longest period of growth since after WWII.  And we entered recession this year before the virus hit
Fascism vs Fascism lite I'm afraid. Joe Biden is not committed to helping the oppressed.
The Obama-Biden administration took us out of a recession once. I think Biden can do it again. Plus, he won’t lie to us everyday and he’ll listen to qualified experts.
That’ll be where Biden would reside. Are you kidding? Biden can’t string a sentence together &amp; you know it. They’re hiding him in basement to spare embarrassment. Same w debates bc Trump would tear him up one side &amp; down the other like Swiss cheese. Poking holes in all his BS!
Punished for what? All the corrup is in the Democratic Party! Your kidding right? Voting for Biden is voting for Hillsry bc he’s just an empty suit &amp; head for that matter &amp; someone else be pulling his strings from behind. Already heard he’s bailing &amp; another stepping in here doin

You didn't say it but you did imply it. You think Biden wont get it done. Well nothing is getting done with trump. He actually implied that the election should be "delayed"
You can have a Biden Presidency or keep rasing consumer spending  But you can't have both.  Sux  Then again, the market quarter reporting is over until October  It's too late to stop Trump's economic NASDAQ campaign
While both are wonderful, neither one is ready to be president day one, which is one of Biden’s prerequisites.
Yes it will be hard for Joe Biden to top ... [checks notes].. a 33% annualized decline in economic activity. The worst in U.S. history.
Maybe he is going to hide in the basement with Biden.
I guess there's an argument that the SALT cap pressures state governments to reduce spending, and removing it would remove that pressure...just seems like a dumb thing to bring up right now. Do it after Biden gets elected
(1) Being "able to" doesn't mean he "will" 😒 Biden is not left. He's definitely centrist and hasn't evolved his thinking over time. Did people suddenly forget about his recent interview where he told Black people they weren't Black if they didn't vote for
Check it out folks #JoeChina AKA  is more worried about none-Americans than he is our countries own citizens. Are we really going to let this man take over the oval office to enrich his son #HunterBiden even more? &amp; the rest of the #Biden family too.... #Trump2020

Electing Biden to get rid of Trump is like burning your house down because the couch is uncomfortable.
Um if Clinton is guilty he should be in jail..
Who is Tiffany?
This is completely ignoring the fact that Biden is a pathological liar, a right-wing corporatist and who his donors are he will barely enact any of the things he promises. Also the middle ground approach doesn't work with the looming climate catastrophe.
I just want to say I do feel bad for those suffering from dementia. My Dad passed from Parkinson’s. It’s just that Joe Biden, Idk how to even describe it but his unapologetic ignorant, abrasive, arrogant attitude towards everything really I find off putting
There’s only one thinking stop a bounce back that’s Joe Biden getting elected this fall please remember to vote trump
Not too sure about Americans you never know they might just be dumb enough to elect Biden as president so he can go over there and give everything away again Democrats are for sale vote trump in November
Not as terrified as I am if Biden becomes President!

Not too happy to be retweeting Eric Trump but I will be giving Biden the benefit of the doubt and say this was an honest mistake?! Reality is: I AM CONCERNED with Biden’s health and preparedness to be president.
It’s time for you and your brother to speak out and say you are voting for  Many people still respect you and your brother. Plus, we all know Barr would vote for Biden.
Wouldn't it be a cool idea to let Biden announce a running mate first? Just saying....
That’s your opinion. For people without health insurance, Obama did a lot. That doesn’t matter. We can have Trump who is casually racist, or Biden who is closet racist, but is at least listening to the far left. Don’t forget who BEGGED for those crime bills...it was us (blacks)🤷🏾‍♂️
Hillary was supposedly “up” the entire election cycle... I don’t buy Biden being up.
Here here!! 👏  it takes great courage to admit misjudgment &amp; change.  Welcome Mr Pereira! We must stand for a fair election!              I am counting on Joe Biden to be a fair and just leader for ALL Americans!  His voice is NOT for sale!
also I'm ready to say, like Sherrod, that folks need to vote their conscious on Biden, and I know that a low-rent war hawk abuser is not as bad as a fascist serial rapist, but I'll be damned if folks ever gave Tara Reade a moment before running a bus over #MeToo
(Two choices* ) Continued* the person who will best fit my agenda as an Americans which is to have less government, keep out socialism, protect religious liberty and not let us go into foreign wars. Trump actions trump Biden’s past record/current agenda for me on those issues
Biden promises not to post cringe
It was ok to attend this because it’s a rally for Joe Biden voters, much like the ones in Portland, Seattle, Chicago, DC, etc.
Folks, it STILL works! If you want to have a lil fun, go make yourself some Biden Memes Courtesy of the Biden Campaign. I JUST made this one for example. It’s easy!
Had Biden ever done anything that isn’t a disaster?  Not just within the last year, but at anytime?   His entire career has been a complete failure.

They're gonna go hard in Ohio 🥺 but I'm already seeing Biden signs in the same spots I was trying Trump ones in 2016 so I'm optimistic
I'm sorry but I have spoken with people having just come out of a literal coma who have had more lucidity than Joseph Biden has in his scripted, edited commercials

Trader Joe’s sounds like a Trump nickname for Joe Biden.
They’re so mad the 5 years of primary fights involving Bernie are over. Biden is Teflon, so they’re attacking the most likely VP pick now out of desperation. But the hive has receipts. They will be stung to political death.
Trump just stopped low income housing from being developed in stable suburban communities. Biden sucks, he’s a terrible option, but he doesn’t empower racist. Trump does, Biden is the lesser evil.

Joe Biden can only pick 1 running mate. No matter who he picks, it's not going to be everybody's 1st choice. We can't turn on him if our choice isn't the one. Nothing is more important than getting the most racist, bigoted president of modern times out of the white house.
I think many leftists (myself included) would be surprised to learn we are being "embraced" by Biden lol
I still believe Biden has a chance here.
The Dems that questioned Barr were amazing asked him important questions that we as Americans want the answers to.  The Reps were a disgrace &amp; refused to try in any way to find out pertinent information that the voters want.  I’m conservative (voting for Biden) and feel this way!
This is awesome!  I thought I was going all Biden and my memory was messed up.  It did happen the way I remember it.  Tricky how they try to erase history.  Erasing it because a lot of evil and criminal stuff
Your brother was going to vote for Biden, you know.
Sad you think Biden isn’t racist, the whole democratic party was founded by racists. When did race even come up? You brought that shit it
And this is their Democratic pick ??👇Joe Biden declines invitation to sit for Fox News interview
That’s easy. Biden’s not a danger to our country. Trump’s taken our country in a dangerous direction &amp; it’s going to take a good long time and a lot of work by future presidents to undo the damage Trump has done to this country.  We need someone that will unite &amp;heal the country.
You taking about Biden? I’m not sure he remembers exactly what he cares about. You do know trump has given the most money ever to historically black colleges right? Did you cash the stimulus check? You know who gave that to you right? or are you gonna say you didn’t cash it?
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Ohio Build Back Better Roundtable with Congresswoman Marcia Fudge” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
You can’t blame Biden without blaming the support and money from the left. Joe Biden is only a symptom of the disease with the Democratic Party at this point...
This Jo Jorgensen chick is the only sane person on the 2020 ballot lol fuck Biden and enough trump.
I know Biden is more popular than Clinton. I think Trump can win but it will take higher voter registration for him
Just because Dr Immanuel wouldn't let Biden sniff her hair
Also Trump dated a black person so he’s not? You can’t use the “I have black friends” card to prove someone ain’t racist. Biden has racist tendencies.
Biden was chosen to get the racist democrats. No way Obama wins if he picks a black VP because racists would freak out.
2021 will be our best financial year, because Joe Biden will be president
Imagine fighting agaisnt lntegration of busing. Busing affected schools you go to. Biden was afraid of his children growing in a “racial Jungle” (his words) and opposed busing. He’s a racist joke.
And Biden makes errors too. Pobody’s Nerfect!
91% freed by the First Step Act passed by Trump were black Americans. Many who were in there due to mass incarceration caused by Biden’s crime bills.
I remember when Bernie supporters spread a fake rape story about Biden. Not once but twice. Also harrased union members with death threats. Let's not forget the constant harassment of Neera Tanden.
In which country? Because we it’s not going to be the USA  Unless, of course, you are now backing Biden who will win bigly
Yo  is there a place I can get a yard sign for your campaign? And does anyone know where I get a Biden one? Or any other Ohio dem? I need me a yard sign
You don’t know anything about me but that I hate Biden and will rather vote for trump. Don’t speak for my character, sir.
If trump is racist then Biden is
If elected he will be a one term. Have two years to pass stuff, gop takes over Congress and then nothing gets done because Biden’s proposals are so left.   You trust Biden negotiating with countries like North Korea and traveling on plane constantly? And making speeches? LOL
I think for myself. I research. Biden is a FRAUD! Been in politcis for 40 years. He doesn’t believe half the shot he’s running on. He just needs to do it for votes! #NeverBiden my generation WILL NOT vote for him
Lol it only takes a little research to see how what my generation is fighting against is what Biden supported and helped create. fact is, he caused the mass incarceration of black people. #FuckBiden
Joe Biden has been in politics since the 70’s but HEY.. he’ll fix the issues THIS TIME!   Helped cause mass incarceration of black people  Helped kill Manufacturing sector  Voted for Iraq war and as VP, pulled troops out which caused Isis to take over territory  WHATA GENIUS ‼️‼️
I would vote for a chimpanzee if he were running against Trump. Joe Biden is a good man. Vote Biden. Defeat Trump
Vote like our lives depend on it !!! Vote for Joe Biden !!!! USAF TSgt. Veteran
That’s why I vote Trump because Biden has a failed record on foreign policy and helping strip working class of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Biden has been in politics since the 70’s (when he defended segregation). It’s time for him to step down from politics.
Just don't take it personal when Biden bytch slaps your boy...😂😂 on a different note how are you guys doing there
Any Biden administration priorities ($15/hr min wage, DC + PR admission, H.R. 1) is DOA in the Senate if they don't kill the filibuster.
Your reaching with the Biden deal. It’s a joke. Like this President and administration he controls.
Ari, have you apologized to Joe Biden and your followers yet?
yes. we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. get out and do whatever you can to get biden elected
One aspect of strong polarization is that people's beliefs about the news are driven by their beliefs about the parties, rather than vice versa.   Biden's been leading Trump by 8-10 pts for over 3 months now. At some point, people's opinions get burned in and won't be changeable.
We’re Obama and Biden in the planning stages of helping inner city neighborhoods for 8 years? Nothing was done. No one got help. What is their excuse?!
A nice start to a policy agenda for Biden. Add a climate change initiative that cleans up all the damage done (and then some), working toward Medicare for all and free daycare, etc, etc...
Yes, "WE" Biden supporters will win BIG! Thank you for acknowledging this. Your starting to wake up🤣.
I believe that several members of the last adminisration are in on a plot to de-legitimize the 2016 election; and I think they should be prosecuted for trying to overthrow our government. Those people are Obama, Biden, H. Clinton, Lynch, Brennan, Clapper, and Comey,

What drugs are you on? Biden’s so called touching of that girl was picked apart by everyone!!! Trumps the rubbing elbows with Stone, Maxwell and JE. Not Biden. Keep reaching bright one!!! Yet to you fucks, this is okay. See Biden didn’t have to pay off anyone. Trump did.

"Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason." So Olsen said then that this is treason. What does he think about it now?
It's amazing that you have so little self-respect, and that you're willing to trample your own integrity in the gutter rather than apologize to Joe Biden and your readers.
He actually has no bearing on us supporters of #maga - he did his 8 years. I even voted for him. Id rather vote for a pile of dog poop then biden. Your party sucks ass with all the extreme lefties and riots.
Exactly. Trump has been a disaster for America. His leadership regarding Covid has been non-existent. He is a childish habitual liar who has created division and hate at unprecedented levels in this country. Biden is not Trump. He’s a leader. That’s plenty of reason to vote Biden
What is your path forward? You have yet to say anything other than vague liberal platitudes that Joe Biden has not or will ever care about.
This is an important note  "Biden’s 10% lead has remained relatively stable since our first swing state voting intention in May.[1]"
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists
Biden better win big, because this country will tear itself apart if this happens.
Trump's lead narrows, Biden is declared winner in a number of states when its certified. Trump protests, Republicans protest and say Dems cheated, lawsuits are filed, and the Supreme Court has to rule on whether ballots should be counted after election day.
The problem is that 35-40% of the country that's his hardcore base.  If they just stomp their feet and say Biden's "not my president," so be it.  But, if these folks want to start "exercising their 2nd Amendment rights" at boards of elections, statehouses, etc., we have a mess.
Biden and Obama gave us the ACA, an actual starting point. Trump has given us nothing but meaningless tweets and proclamations.
I've long debated whether creating a cabinet department to address climate, as this post proposes, was the right approach. I'm still unconvinced.
And this is exactly what Joe Biden’s administration will do right off the bat
Weren't you the one  back in April who retweeted an article that Joe Biden suggesting this would happen was a conspiracy theory?
Obama gives this great progressive speech and then probably gets on the phone to encourage Biden to pick another moderate in Kamala Harris as VP. It's his presidency all over again
The post office has a lot of Biden supporters handling the ballots. There are stories from IN, WV, FL, and TX, etc, in which postal workers were caught throwing away conservative flyers, and discarding mail-in ballots from conservative areas.
Don't want to  him but counterpoint - why risk your health to vote for Biden in person? I was willing to make that risk for Medicare 4 All. I'm not sure I am willing to risk it for whatever Biden stands for. (FWIW I've requested my ballot and I'm not sure Ohio actually matters)
I dont care if someone turns up pictures of Joe Biden having sex with two midgets, a monkey and a pirate. I will still vote for him!
Watch "Biden Campaign Is SINKING As 75% of Swing Voters TURN THEIR BACKS On Joe!" on YouTube    #Trump2020LandslideVictory
If Trump denies the election, and he puts his goons in our cities, what will he do to Barack Obama? Joe Biden? Michelle Obama? Hillary Clinton? We need to think about this. We know HE is.
You're pushing these fallacies because you know Biden has your number in November. You've already fairly lost a second term. Because you're despicable
Still not clear on your view on Biden's comments.  Biden said "Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held."   Seems like he was making a reasonable - and now proved correct - statement, no?
Hey boomer why don’t you relax... I never said I supported trump. I was just pointing out the reasoning behind him continuing to boost about him passing a very simple test. Trump is an idiot and Biden has dementia, this is America
President Barack Obama endorses Joe Biden For President  via
Joe Biden says Trump's failure to lead is responsible for historic economic slump - CNBC
How mentally challenged is this country if they elect Joe freaking Biden? They are so confident they will rig this election they let him be the incoherent candidate.
Doubtful.  This virus is from China.  They are to blame.  Not Trump, who implemented a travel ban and was then called xenophobic by Biden and Pelosi.
You can have a record stock market or you can have President Biden  but you can't have both
Hoping for an unquestionable Biden landslide. Gotta get trump out.
You do realize he’s only boosting about those test results because he knows Biden won’t be able to pass the test due to his early onset dementia
I pray that if Biden wins this Nov, he takes note of how much he owes to  &amp; the leaders of  &amp; bring them into his administration.
Support removing the Imbecile in Chief from office on November 3rd, the worst potus in history. Vote Biden for the 46th President of the United States!
What they aren't voting for Joe Biden? What if they are voting third party or write ins?
Remember the outrage over this? We were so young then.
So you’re throwing your vote for a mentally ill “slavery was choice” and “Harriet Tubman didn’t free the slaves” little man, are you dense? Kanye is a Trump supporter, there isn’t one possible way he can beat Joe Biden based on write-ins. Your vote is a waste.
That is exactly how I feel. If you are not for Trump now, you would be voting Biden or Dem. If they are truly undecided after three years and Covid, its remarkable. They are not really undecided, they are the "Shy Trump" voter.
There's nothing transformative here. Nothing.  Biden economic equity plan calls for investment in minority business and workers
Or more simply put - Biden is a prophet.
Trump and Biden are the best we can come up with? What more proof do we need that the American political system needs reworked
We got our Biden sign today! #Vote2020 #Biden2020
I don’t think Biden knows where he is at right now. I do know if you don’t vote for him “you ain’t black”
This is my hastily drawn mspaint political cartoon (in response to Biden sucks, Vote for Biden). Forgive the low quality of art, but I felt I needed to put it out there
Pretty sad when they have to use Reagan to push for Biden.
1.) Narcissism won't let him go out looking like a loser. 2.) Fear of a Biden DoJ. 3.) Fear of losing control of the GOP.
Including Joe Biden, who said it in April and got lambasted by conservatives for such a libelous and scurrilous attack.
As Trump pulls out of Michigan... #OperationGrant
Joe Biden is good at predicting things:
You wanna investigate Biden while trump over here thinking about postponing the election? What?!
Listen to yourself! The more people you let vote, the better chance Biden has to win.   Look, we can and should improve the security of mail-in voting and take measures to eliminate voting fraud. GOP won't vote for it. Put 2 and 2 together.  /argument
I agree.  I hope Biden selects her.  She is well-spoken, intelligent and a fighter!
Lies on top of lies. Mail in voting is safer than voting booths which can be hacked as you know. But either way come Nov. I'm voting for Biden. I had enough of the crook in the Oval Office.
If you want the right WH to do right by manufacturing, ask  whether he sees more upside with Biden or Trump. And listen to him—he’s the gold standard.
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes
Joe Biden predicted it back in April     Let imagine he was in the oval office back in January when #COVID19 started.  Where would we be today????
The question wasn’t whether Trump would be convicted in court. Rather, the question was around intellectual consistency on the part of  . My guess is he will exhibit none. Don’t understand your statement about Biden’s comments not being a close call?
He pays what he has according to the law. Blame the old fucks like Biden who have been sitting in the Senate for 30 years and not doing anything about the tax code
welp, Biden was right
Biden Vs Trump is like having to pick between ash and mud. I vote for The Rock.
FAKE NEWS BY DONALD J. TRUMP!  DONALD J. TRUMP WANTS TO CHEAT TO WIN THIS ELECTION AGAIN!   DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS PUNK!   JOE BIDEN IS A BETTER CHOICE!  DONALD J. TRUMP VOTES BY MAIL IN EVERY ELECTION! #CorruptTrump #CheatingTrump

Hey  based on today’s statement direct from the prez, care to apologize for your wildly naive claim that Biden was wrong for daring to suggest Trump would consider trying to delay the election?
Without any evidence, RNC chair McDaniels calls poll numbers showing Biden leading 'inaccurate.' She might be more credible if she says misleading, or skewed. Even 'early' would be a better description. Not inaccurate.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail    Biden said it....Trump will try to delay the vote. Mail-in is the best option for those not wanting to physically go to a location.
We have literally the two worst candidates for President. Trump and Biden. As worst as 2016. I'm so done with politics.
If you champion Trump you are a clown. If you champion biden you are a clown. Blow the whole system up
Biden/Obama bemoan how certain things just shouldn't be politicized... immediately followed by, isn't it just wonderful how politicized these 8th graders are.
This sure aged well - “Joe Biden accused Trump of trying to delay the election. He should know better.” ⁦
As the great Billy Madison once said: “Ms. Lippy, the part of the story I don’t understand is if everyone is “winning”, the economy is roaring back, and Trump supporters are more enthusiastic then Biden supporters. Why delay the election at all? How about voting rn🤷🏾‍♂️?” #delay
According to the WaPo editorial,  believes Biden’s accusation of Trump trying to delay the election is an accusation of treason. Now that Trump has openly talked about delaying the election, does Olsen agree Trump’s tweet was treasonous?
Trump's tweet about delaying the election just made Biden look like a genius when he brought it up months ago.
Biden was correct, again.
Biden wants to swing with Kamala. Jill not so keen.
Over 150,000 American citizens dead. We just had the worst quarter since World War II....American Soldiers have bounties put on them by his friend in Moscow.  Tell me again about Joe Biden being a failure.
Hey, remember in April when Biden said he’d do exactly this, and conservatives went NUTS at him for making such a ridiculous and scurrilous attack?
One way you can tell the VP “they’ll only be focused on becoming president” talk is sexist (other than the obvious): If Biden wins he’s made it clear he probably will only serve a term, therefore the VP won’t pose any challenge to his renomination and reelection.
Isn't Hunter Biden a private citizen? He doesn't put himself out there unlike you and you're family of crooks.
So Vice President Biden is clairvoyant as well. A bonus for the next president of the United States. #VoteHimOut
I cannot wait to live in Joe Biden’s America.
Joe Biden says we need a President to LEAD. Must not be HIM because he can't even LEAD A DUCK TO WATER!
Can you imagine Obama pulling this?  Oh, let's delay the election.  And Trump's minions are so programmed, they support this, just to keep him in office.  And no, I wouldn't want Obama, or Biden or anyone to do this and it should have been stopped a long time ago.
voting down marijuana legalization to cater to the 1% of republicans who are gonna vote for biden this election &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
I for one will find it hilarious if this happens, he tanks the election beyond hope, and is then surprised to find himself kicked out in favor of the House’s choice of Biden.
U know what eles Donald trump has show us joe biden is u and your democrats friends that take corporate money don't care about normal people and u are not omit you did things wrong to us and not give us what the people ask for and not keep everything the same from your policypass
I don’t think people are locked into the Bill Bahr testimony - so I am saying I just don’t think it will matter is all.  Also Biden is polling way ahead of Trump on “law and order” and “crime,” so I am not sure Bahr has the upper hand there
Same. Biden is a far weaker candidate than HRC. I can’t see him even surviving the debates. Plus I think average Americans are weary of the rioting, protests and are basically ignoring it all. I know I am.
Biden has been more supportive of LGBT rights than Bernie, is more pro immigration than Bernie, has done more for women than Bernie, Bernie dismisses minority rights as “identity politics”..... so yeah... not sure what point you’re making...
So....If #trump loses, it will be because of #MailInVoterFraud. If #biden loses, it will be because of #VoterSuppression. Did I get that straight? #Election2020
Then you better find someone other than Joe Biden!  He is ten times all of those things you "think" Trump is.
You haven’t been listening. Nor reading. Biden has put out severa good plans and given many speeches on specific topics. All with reasonable and sound specific on what he would do as president. Maybe go to his website and see for yourself. And follow some Dems who support Biden.
Let the games begin, Biden enters the Ohio TV market with ad featuring his Scranton upbringing (btw 3rd shot they use is of the Lackawanna Station where we had our wedding reception).
Can't wait until Biden has a woman running mate and everyone hates her while insisting they'd love any other woman just not this one
I was thinking the same thing. Reminds me of Biden talking about poor students and then white students. How ridiculous.
Biden promises to allow terrorists in country if he’s president -
I’m willing to crawl over broken, Covid19 covered glass to cast my vote for Joe Biden ✋
I live in a suburb of Cleveland and have not seen a single Trump yard sign. Biden signs are popping up everywhere. #SuburbsForBiden
Biden’s team should start playing videos of trump praising and defending Putin over and over again.
In the era of our next President Joe Biden, news will be described as relevent news. Or science news. Or just plain news. Oh happy day.
Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report  #FoxNews

Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
You are aware that these things also happened under Obama &amp; Biden  and every other adminstration before that right? The USA has always been like this and never was a true Democracy.
I heard that, Biden has one foot in the grave and you have a younger woman who possibly could run the country ? Maybe ?
Ewwww Biden. I cringe every time..
Ukrainian Americans for Biden launch campaign  HOW, AFTER  BIDEN BLACKMAILED UKRAINE  TO REMOVE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR INVESTIGATING BIDEN SON CORRUPTION. IF  LIFE IS  ABOUT CHANGE  HOW HAS 50 YEARS ON THE HILL NOT DONEE  THIS? MUCH STUPIDITY NO LOGIC!
Send this in your own words to others! There is a huge trend here... Trump crushes Biden.. BUT they know it and he wont get the nomination !
Joe Biden should let all these leakers go right now because they may well be like trump’s White House. I wonder if them leakers only voted for Biden? Biden/Harris is where we’re.
Presidential debate where they put trump and Biden in a escape room and just televise it
And Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. just cuz you got a black middle name I still don’t like you. But ima vote for you Robinette.
Trump has lost his economic edge over Biden   #TrumpResign
has done more in three years then Joe Biden has done in 47. #Election2020
Hey remember how joe Biden has a credible sexual assault allegation but we just let it go like we did for trump. Yeah, unacceptable
I don’t know how anyone puts Joe Biden had a trump he can’t remember dates places ask him a question he takes him 10 minutes and he still doesn’t answer the question world leaders when I take a serious note Trump
I think Warren was dropped from the list. I think Biden knows the reality: she's too old &amp; we'd lose her seat. That pretty much obliterates her qualifications.
Where would you put Franken in a Biden cabinet?
Couldn't we just leave him in the WH and choose an alternate location for Biden to at least start out in? Just ignore him.
Well biden sent out im sure😂😂😂
We don’t need to worry about Democrats being overconfident and not voting because of highly positive polls for Biden. Democrats want to blow Trump out in historic fashion. They will be running up the score.
BIDEN: "We already have a nigger mayor and we don't need any more nigger big shots"  #BitChute
I think Biden is a clone too.
I saw lots of Biden signs today in the next county from Cleveland
I wish he had a chance. Sadly, he doesn’t. So the choices are trump, a serial liar/rapist, poor businessman, tax cheat &amp; biden, a rapist, career politician with a history of legislation that hurts POC, and wars. Some choice huh?
Yea vote Biden. Then welcome in the UN Troops. Welcome in tyranny. Welcome in the awakening of real misery. Smh
Funny thing is we got "Blacks for Trump" "Latinos for Trump" "Asians for Trump". Have you ever heard the same thing about Biden? No, and if you did it was fake.
Agree! Not a pure Trump fan but people will be regretting so many things of Biden comes out on top. Mark my words it will get very, very bad.
You worded that perfectly for me. It’s a struggle. The moment I say I’m voting for someone who isn’t Biden, all I’m gonna get is you are just aiding Trump.
Biden shouldn’t be allowed around schools Bidephile
Non-stop “Orange Man Bad” tweets should get Biden elected for sure
Campaign commercials are like:   “Joe Biden for president.... BERNIE ENDORSED HIM, OFFICIALLY ENDORSED BY BERNIE FUCKING SANDERS, YOUR GUY, BERNIE, ENDORSED OUR GUY, JOE BIDEN so go ahead and vote for him for America REMEMBER BERNIE ENDORSED HIM”
We're sick and tired of you. Biden 2020
You spelled Joe Biden wrong.
And I assume some think she's simply not the best candidate? I'm in that camp. I'm also in the camp that thinks this should primarily be a personal decision on Biden's part.
LOL Biden can hardly form a coherent sentence. Way to go man. 😂😆😆🤣
Bottoms is the real deal ! What a great Woman,  Biden better pick her!!
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic extremist' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins
Lol my more moderate, conservative Democrat in laws in Ohio fucking love her. My father in law wishes it was her instead of Biden. I don’t think they realize how much scared suburban white people love the idea of a strong prosecutor.
Republicans see Biden coming fast, time to pretend to care about the deficit!
Donald Trump Jr. made sure to comment on the matter, tweeting, "Joe Biden saved by a staffer before his usual meltdown. Cut off because they know he’s not competent! How can this guy be expected to run the country if he needs to be handled for a simple TV interview?
Why blame just party? Voters had chance to vote in primaries. They picked trump in 2016 &amp; Biden in 2020 over many much more qualified &amp; better candidates. Voters are equally responsible for this mess.
I work in a “memory care unit” and have worked with dementia patients for over 12 years. Dementia patients have a certain walk. I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, Joe Biden has that unique walk.
I have no idea how many Warren voters are actually pledging not to support Biden if she doesn’t get the VP nomination.  I guess not many—Warren supporters were much more likely to go along with #BlueNoMatterWho than Sanders folks. But TBH, one is too many. Knock it off.
Dear “Joe Biden’s allies” stop.
You’re saying I’m not black? Sorry I don’t always vote blue, Joe Biden.
McCain was SIX YEARS YOUNGER than Biden is now
It's because they're actively in denial that Biden's age is a problem
(I honestly feel like we're not talking about this nearly enough  You can call it ageism if you like but if Joe Biden actually serves eight full years as President he'll be older than all my grandparents were when they died)
The fact that that Joe Biden was supposed to be too old to run for President in 2016 and now he's the nominee in 2020 is, of course, yet another very pressing reason you want a VP who is prepared to become President
The fact that, when Joe Biden became VP, everyone thought he was too old to ever run for President again is why he did in fact come under fire (fairly or not) for just dicking around for those eight years
Ok so you’re Canadian? We’re really at a crucial point in America. This election is do or die for our democracy. We really don’t need outsiders coming in to muddy the waters. Biden is the nominee and we should all vote for him no matter who he picks! Stir things up at home please
They should be found, arrested, and tried.   - Joe Biden on the protesters who attacked the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse, Portland Oregon
Not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden.
That’s an opinion piece. I’ve read real news articles that say the opposite. As she says: It’s all politics. She’s good and everyone knows it. Some are threatened by strong women. Hope Biden’s not.
Biden cares about what’s underneath the clothing of little boys and girls
Biden promised to serve one term so obviously the VP should indeed be planning on becoming president.
Joe Biden takes black vote for granted.   Trump has tried to earn it with ACTION.   Biden said “you ain’t black” if you vote Trump.   I say prove him wrong and vote Trump who has proven record that helped black community. He even banned chokehold and encouraged police reform.
Just like the liberal Democrats can tell Joe Biden is there’s no riding going on and he’s so loopy that he won’t even know he would believe him he broke believe them now
We only have one person who can do that that is President Trump let’s elect him back again so we can finish the job and bring all the stuff home if Biden gets elected it’s all over
#Trump's policies are destroying the robust economy the #Obama administration built. His refusal to address the pandemic will lead to the complete collapse of our #economy. He is a selfish weak man. Dump Trump vote #Biden!
The #President is sending #federal goon squads into our cities to foment racism and violence. #Trump is the least patriotic in the U.S. right now. Kissing master #Putin's ass. You are a #weak man sir. #Mentally ill in need of a rubber room. Vote #Biden!!
So did Biden answer more MSM questions today than Trump, or not?
BBC News - Trump's shortcomings make weak opponent Biden look strong
Camilla Harris should help Biden lock in the state of California.
Isn't that the intent for whomever becomes the VP candidate? Biden isn't mentally fit for office now.
Nah, I said what I said and I was correct.  Tell the truth, if Diamond and Silk acted the EXACT SAME WAY that they act for Trump, with the loud talk and finger wagging, but did it for Biden, you’d be calling them ghetto trash and wondering how much welfare they get.
I would put money on it that it’s a Democrat/Biden supporter. Most of these turn out that way. Definitely will not get the answer from CLE dot though.
Rumor has it the Ohio Pharmacy Board has many holdovers from Kasich. Makes sense given he's supposedly going to speak for Biden at the DNC.  I still don't get that one.
The person asking Biden was talking about more funds for mental health and housing. Biden said I agree we need more funding. The person then said would you commit to redirecting some of the police funding? And he answered: yes. So yes, Biden does want to defund Police.
Depends on the area but certain cities I clearly remember as full of Trump signs are not so full anymore. Do see Biden signs in those same areas. Trump voters may just be quieter now. The Biden will defund the police ad that’s running is a total lie but effective for many.
DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. BIDEN HAD 40+ YEARS TO FIX THESE ISSUES. HE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A POLITICIAN THAT TALKS NICE WORDS BUT ACTIONS ≠ SPOKEN PROMISES.
DONT VOTE BIDEN!! Failed on foreign policy his whole LIFE!!
Biden voted for Iraq war that made youth like me go over and die in a place we should never have been. Then he and Obama pulled troops out and caused Caliphate to take over land. Leading to more troops having to go over there. Trump defeated caliphate and pulled out troops.
Amen! ☕️⚖️🙏♥️ facts matter!   I hope you are Biden’s VP! 🙏💞⚖️♥️ Good luck!!!! 🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸
it's an uncommonly stupid thing for the Biden people to say/signal
The only thing I liked about her was her attacks on Biden.
It’s not that she’s not popular. She is. It’s that she’s from CA which the Dems have locked up. She doesn’t help you with the left wing of the party. She is just like running two Biden’s.
Isn’t that the point of Biden limiting himself to one term???
The Singular Most Excellent Very Good Reason to Vote for Joe Biden | by Gayle Leslie | The Black Intellect Journal | Medium
The only way she agrees to VP is Biden agrees to step down and she walks back into white. House
No, Ive made my mind up already. There is no way in hell I’m voting for Joe Biden
Thus commercialbis absolutely disturbing. Biden loves Omar and Talebe
It wld  🐝 interesting 2 see real-time voter preferences frm CAN🇨🇦, MEX🇲🇽&amp; EU🇪🇺 countries on Biden vs tRump in Nov.   If that's not available, a goof laff track will do.  Just musing! 🤷‍♂️   #ResignTrumPence
She will be wildly unpopular with the left side of the party. Her being VP will make her the front runner in 2024 and doing anything to help her or Biden once elected will be seen as supporting her for POTUS. She complicated everything in exchange for no Electoral help
This has been the ticket I was told by someone back in November if Biden won nomination this would be his running mate.  I doubt he changes course.
*Whispers* This is 100% correct. Harris is a bad choice. Biden can do much better. Rice, Warren, or even Duckworth are better options.
That's not all true. The first part is, but not the second. We've had plenty of VPs who didn't run. Hell, Joe Biden didn't even run fresh after being VP for 8 years. Dick Cheney didn't run. Dan Quayle didn't run. That was NOT what the VP was established for.
The best thing about this is hearing Biden speak about a woman who challenged him fiercely &amp; called him on the carpet publically. He gives her total &amp; all due respect. That is presidential behavior. We must restore civility to our nation’s highest office to 🛑 societal corrosion.
Brain Dead Biden
You vote Trump you're a racist. You vote Biden you're a pedophile. No two ways about it!!! #rockthevote
Joe Biden seems like a guy who knows a guy who knows Rick Sanchez
I want an ambitious VP! Biden needs to select a potential successor. The man is old!
Wow. You're such a racist. Resign already. Biden 2020.
Pandemic hurt EVERY economy in the world. It’s who you trust to help rebuild it and I saw what Trump did for me and my family/community. I trust Trump over Biden in regards to economy.
Nobody gets that its stopping the next guy like trump that important. We can band aid it, but in 4 year another one like him will be there. I mean look how many greedy spawn he has himself. We need to prevent the next one, that's not what joe biden cares about.
I’m getting really fucking sick of the Democrats rejecting what they know the majority of people want. It’s getting very hard to continuously convince myself that there’s even a point to vote for Biden because it’s getting clearer and clearer that they don’t care.
I don’t see the extreme left Antifa/Marxists just stopping their terrorism if Biden is elected.  And I don’t see Biden having a spine to address this stuff.
Trump news: President gets defensive over plummeting polls as Pence, Pelosi, Biden and others pay respects to John Lewis
I get it your side. I respect your opinion.  But my perception of where Biden or the puppet known as Biden will take us is drastically different than yours. It is what it is. Perhaps the extremists in Portland have ruined it for me....

And you glossed over the fact that Biden’s America seems pretty rooted in communism.  Be careful what you ask for.
I mean. Cute pic.  But yea. Isn’t that what politics are?  Which of the 2 liars is lying less to us?  Quite a few have been historically creepy.  Clinton still creepier then Biden( who was recently accused of rape)
Yea I might have to vote Biden off strength
It’s been my experience that all politicians have tremendous amount of dirt. I fear communism more than Trump at this point.  Not to mention. Biden has made racist comments and is creepy towards children. Cognitively he has no ability to lead. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wait till popcorn finds out Biden was in the hood reppin.
I’m at nurse on a “memory care unit” and I’ve worked with A LOT of patients with dementia. They have a certain walk. And Joe Biden has that walk. I’m TELLING you, that man has all the classic symptoms of dementia.
If you’d like to read another pointless article by the Cleveland Jewish News mentioning an un-related sentence of me “supporting Hezbollah” here it is. Crappy journalism. “Tlaib says she’s not endorsing Biden, or maybe anyone, for president.”  via
Yes. A better question is which of these women is most prepared to be POTUS if Biden cannot perform the duties as Commander-in-Chief? Susan Rice would be my choice.
What I’m hearing in NE Ohio is still some Trump diehards but a lot more I’m hearing that they don’t want to vote for him but also don’t know if Biden can fix our current problems. Hearing that more and more lately.
While people like Joe Biden and Jerry Nadler express their strong endorsement of Antifa and Anarchy, President Trump is working hard to restore LAW AND ORDER in these liberal run-cities of chaos.  #VoteRed!!
FUCK JOE BIDEN! How can you openly admit he is a bad choice and then say “I’m still going to vote for him” Then convince someone who isn’t so easy to fold that they should vote for him?🤔🤷🏾‍♂️That sales pitch is TRASH!#NeverBidenNeverTrump
Listen this lady literally just told me I belong in Gitmo because I said “revolution is messy.” She obviously has forgotten that the US was built on the back of revolution, I wouldn’t expect her to understand that Biden has never had his own administration.
Every poll I've seen today has been great for Biden including only being down 1 in GA
I've tried very hard to talk to Republicans about Trump in the lens of this is not GOP hatred. Mitt Romney would be beating Biden in the polls. I can't get across to them that he's truly, objectively bad. Yes the media and Democrats never gave him a chance. Still. Objectively bad
People who aren’t voting for Biden need to hop off of their own dicks. No, he won’t bring nearly enough change with him, but he is objectively a step in the right direction for fucks sake
Maybe in theory, but I think everyone in the Democratic Party with a pulse is goin to run in 2024. Which means nobody will want to help a Biden/Harris WH in fear that they would be helping her secure the nomination. It’s why I think Susan Rice would be a good compromise pick
Been Republican my entire life. Now I refer to myself as conservative, but don’t want others to mistake me as Trump Republican. That man, who isn’t Republican or conservative, has left so many of us without a political party we can call ours or identify with. Biden has my vote.
Silence for over a week, then a statement of support for "law and order" and the arrest of anarchists, which is a term that can be applied to whomever law enforcement decides
It's difficult bc it doesn't seem like that wing of the party has enough high-profile, established members that would be good for a position like this, yet. Seems like a Warren choice would only make left hate Warren more, not like Biden more.
Even Joe Biden has already acknowledged that this is impossible. There will be 30 million homeless people here in the USA by the end of the year many of them willing to commit crimes to feed their families. There is no going back to what privileged people perceived as normal.
I’m not sure there is. They are never happy. I think they would be at least tolerant of Warren. I just think picking Harrris is the choice they hate most and will give them a validish reason to say we gave Biden a chance and this is what he did.
Two Joe Biden's running the government and one is a cop. Fun!
Both Trump &amp; Biden have lots of accusations with minors. Some I’m sure are false, some are more credible than others... I don’t believe either man is innocent when it comes to inappropriate behavior with women. There is a good chance some of the allegations are true for both men.
It's going to be super fun a year from now when Dem's can't pass a major piece of legislation because Biden was too stupid to pick an actual liberal to be his VP. The left wing of the party is going to laugh their ass off when VP Harris tries to broker a deal.
This fucking guy needs to retire with Biden.
even his wife said you have to swallow
Unless you plan on questioning they DON'T have to read your rights (little loophole I learned myself the hard way.) And you all want to fix this by voting for Biden...
If Biden picks Harris the far left has every right to not show up for him. It's a gigantic middle finger.
Only if Biden gets an implanted mic, and is amped up on drugs.
Oh, and YOU-TRUMP-Your Emperor-ness, will offer everyone a "chance"? Trump, my dear sir, are the definition of "FAILURE". Please stop trying to drag Biden into your own faults. IT WON'T WORK with those that have any, any intelligence. Your insulting...to say the least.
As my Susan Rice prediction comes true   Along with me saying it would be  Trump vs Biden in 2019  I WILL HAVE PROVEN I AM THE MOST ACCURATE POLITICAL FORCASTER IN THE WORLD
Biden is Colin from what we do in the shadows
Where biden stand on #M4A ?
The issue is basing how far left the party is off of how much free shit is offered. When you include all metrics, Biden is significantly to the left of Bernie. But say that, and 🌹 Twitter activates their spaz army.
Leftists measure the left/right comparison based on free stuff and nothing else. Tell them that with all metrics included, Biden is actually significantly to the left of Bernie, and they go insane.
People are going to struggle to be 'Ridin' with Biden' for as long as he promotes a toothless, middle of the road platform. For many, that's always going to make his presidential bid 'Bidin' time with Biden'...and that's going to have to be good enough (and for many it won't be)
Trump's attempt to cast Biden in that light follows a pattern seen throughout his presidency, where he attempts to shift responsibility, often to President Barack Obama, even more than three years after taking office.
Joe Biden says he'll announce vice president pick in first week of August
New Economist/YouGov poll shows Biden +9. Electorate is D+13. 9 points higher in the differential between D's and R's in 2018. Weighing it on 2018 electorate yields a Biden lead of 3.79%.
I doubt even the D's will be dumb enough to put many hopes in OH. The only way OH goes for Biden is in a wipeout wave election where the state won't matter anyways.
I know what you did for Biden in the primaries. All I can say is please, PLEASE, don't blow this opportunity! Too much is at stake. We have just three months left. Anything can happen. DON'T SCREW UP!!!🙏

Joe Biden is more man than you will ever or could ever be.
Fox is already preparing for a Biden presidency in a few months. Trump is Old News
And so is Biden
Agreed, I just see way too much false equivalency/“establishment” shit that legit has people thinking there isn’t enough difference between Biden and Trump and it makes me want to tear my hair out sometimes
I dont know what this is about because I'm blocked but 1 Bernie supporter doesn't represent the entirety. I'm voting for Biden even though Bernie was my preference and I'm tired of all of us being equated with that view point.
Hopefully Biden will press him on this during the debates.
Politico accidentally reports Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate  #FoxNews
Susan Rice just gave us a strong answer without directly telling us if she's in the running to be the VP mate for Joe Biden. Sounds like she's being considered to me. ☺️ #TheView
So Jim Jordan’s nonsense wasn’t an attempt to embarrass and condemn Obama and Biden!?
Yup, Joe Biden who believes weed is a gateway drug is just a puppet for the radical left 🙄
If everyone in the 3 largest metropolitan areas (Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati) vote Biden will win the state.  Obama won Ohio twice.
Self absorbed and has no business voting. You can support Biden and still be involved in the progressive end of the party. You just need to be active, not reactive

Biden: "a lost ball in tall grass.”
Not quite sure what you're trying to say. My point was Biden's comment wasn't a big deal, since I'm African American I think I'm qualified to say that. And the 2nd one, in contemporary times Trump is the 1st openly racist to be president.
Hey Bernie why don't you get behind Biden like you said and show some support instead of still trying to run a campaign that is over. If Trump is gonna be defeated, the Biden needs all the support he can get #RidenWithBiden2020
When he isn’t being Super Biden in his secret lair (basement). He conceals his identity by going out in public as a mild mannered blind man without his mask.
I don't care if Biden get 270 electoral votes and loses by 5M popular votes.  He wins.  Storm the Capitol America.  It is on.
I've been saying, for weeks, that the Dems aren't running Biden, they are running his future VP candidate for President.
175 days until January 20, 2021. By all means Trump should keep up his Rose Garden rantings every day until November 3. If that would not swing the election Biden's way, what would?
I'm next door in Ohio and he's still trying to make us believe Joe Biden is on a mission to kill the elderly. Please give our airwaves a rest 🤦🏻‍♀️
Committing crimes??? Hahahaha.... yeah, ok. Last I checked Trump isn't using the FBI to spy on Biden ,nor is he colluding with a foreign cou try to create a bogus dossier. "Crimes "  lol

So with Harris as the Dems VP nominee, they get who they really wanted to be President. Biden is an end to a means because Harris would never beat trump 1:1

Every Covid19 death and unemployed worker, including those from the past year, will become Biden's fault on 1/21/21.  2022 will be 2010 all over again, on steroids.

There are millions of us who absolutely cant stand biden. Biden is a Republican who wants to screw us, just with a smile.  What are the major differences between the two of them policy wise? Aside from spray tan amd twitter usage, they arent that different.
Please join me in advocating for more hearings and passage of my Paid Family Leave bills!  Also, FYI, my very few NO votes on DNC Platform amendments reflect my preference for Biden camp language over Bernie camp. They were not NO votes to the actual policies. Stay tuned🤜🏽🤛🏽💙✊🏽

Yeah you must know by now Nancy’s not the swiftest tool in the shed anymore she’s more like a puppet which she will see that ends up being more like Joe Biden if he gets elected someone gets out there and says dumb things with someone else is pulling the strings
The people in the Never Trump circles are willing to give up all their convictions and ideals to get rid of Trump. They are now Democrats. As soon as they vote Biden they support gun control, abortion, socialism, etc....  There is no higher ground there.

Or, he is so confident in Russian/Putin interference in the election coupled with the false reports with doctored poll numbers given to him to void his tantrum fueled outbursts, he has no clue to how many points ahead Biden truly is.
An aging, sleepy, barely alive Joe Biden is still better than your father.
😂😂We’ll see, won’t we? I think 12 weeks of campaigning is plenty for Biden to collapse. He’s a horse’s ass. And the Obama DOJ is going to be getting hit with indictments pretty soon, so we’ll see how that plays with the electorate.
There hasn’t even been a campaign yet. As soon as Biden has to campaign, he will collapse. He’s every bit as horrible a politician as Hillary - and that’s if he is NOT half-way into senescence as he appears to be.

Because Biden, unlike Trump, is capable of compassion.
We can think of one: William McKinley. But that was 120 years ago.  Biden might be that old, tho, so it might remain in mind.
Hopefully, the Biden administration will investigate him, and he’ll go to jail with Trump.
Democrats finally had their chance to grill Bill Barr. They blew it.  why the 5minute rule and why no attorneys questioning? They’ve bet everything on Biden winning the election. If the former vice president fails to do that..full blown Fascism #ImpeachBarr
We regard Biden as no improvement. Be aware of that.  If Trump wins, we'll be fighting him every day.  If Biden wins, we'll be fighting him every day, too.  Neither party values 'democracy' when its power is threatened, so favoring either is no gain at all.
And the images of Fascism under my rule will look like them under Biden

I agree with that. Though if I’m being fair, polling did have Biden slightly ahead of Bernie in head to head against Trump. Not by like a significant amount though.
Wow! Stephen King is nothing but a paid leftist liberal troll doing the dirty work for the Democrats in ther disinformation warfare to try &amp; elect Biden! They must have dirty laundry on  Is he caught up in the pedophilia ring? I mean what’s really going on?

Booger Mcfarland is the Joe Biden of Broadcastinf
I had an idea it would swing that way. Obama was invincible, conservatives needed someone to step so they swung far right. Now in response the left wants to swing that way but the party gave them Biden. If he wins and sucks a more moderate Romney style R could win in the future.
JFK was brilliant, he was bred to be president. He had the education, military service, and family to back him up. She has support from a temporary progressive swing. The country will head more moderate in a cycle or two. Once trumps gone, and Biden shits the bed. (If he wins)
He wants anarchists to be prosecuted and in that particular sentence he didn't specify what for. I think it was implied, but also, I think the statement implies that anarchists are all criminals. But thinking Biden's going to bother with such nuance? Get real!
I don’t get that either! What kind if idiots look at that and say “Oh boy that Biden look what he’s doing. Are they that dumb??
I don't want to get deep into Biden's history of being prejudiced, hanging out with people who are prejudiced, passing prejudiced legislation, and making prejudiced arguments. Nonetheless, the fact he has this history seems relevant to interpreting his statement on anarchists.
What will you do if Biden wins
Why do you think a former VP would not think that someone who wants to live under no government is necessarily a violent trouble maker?  This is the same Biden who slandered the driver who crashed into Biden's family, casting him as a reckless alcoholic, repeatedly.
And here’s Biden’s vp... the answer is no. I’ll vote in person so I know my trump vote is not thrown into the garbage.
So would you leave the country if Biden was elected

Trump will probably not win Ohio. He can thank indicted Oho House Speaker Larry Householder, whose arrest last week probably gifted the state to Joe Biden.
I should thank Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder for gifting the state to Joe Biden last week. Thanks, Larry! Enjoy prison! Maybe I'll send you a card.
But the whole idea behind #VoteBlueNoMatterWho is that Biden's audience will vote no matter what, so that gives you a lot of leeway to have your cake and eat it too. You can satisfy the progressives of the party knowing that the Biden wing won't leave them no matter what you do.
The thing about coalitions is they’re always changing! Would Biden see an advantage to be a moderating force on the left in a left-liberal coalition or a necessary block to the influence of the far right? Those are the questions that would shape coalitions.
I DID hear this! Barr also “understands the concern” that a Biden Attorney General would bury everything Durham and whoever else is doing. #BarrHearing #Durham
Terrific, looks like the giggler is back. Funny, if Biden were to somehow win, she’ll be President within two years. But in the democrat primaries, she was pulling around 2% of democrat votes. Not even D’s like the giggler.

I am believing this "response bias" is real in polling. The country is way to polarized to have anyone win above 5% now. So it's inflating Biden's lead. The old adage is "bad data in, bad data out". And when the polls are bad and put into a model, the model is therefore "bad"
If it was Genghis Kon I would still vote Biden

Why do you keep bring up black voters? I care about everyone, the Democrats can pander to blacks, but the same crime Bill's blacks are fighting, joe biden was writing and having a hand in 25 years ago. So explain that. He is on the wrong side of history.
I've litteraly never used the term fake news. I'm actually left, I dont just pretend to be then go along with outdated racist policy rooted in hate. Your argument is never going to make sense. Pretending like I like trump,  because I dont like biden is a joke. Both can suck.

Fuck Sleepy Joe! He is a skinny ass Trump and they both want to run this country like a dictatorship. Even if Biden wins he can’t stop what’s going on,this is the state and they’ll do whatever is in their power to keep it corrupt.
Does it really matter? He’s gonna step down anyway. I’m betting on Kamala bc they’re propping up her Wiki profile &amp; she got a horrendous face job. 🙄

Like I said, how does it not upset you that 85% of liberals want healthcare for all, but biden just said he doesnt care. During a pandemic, we've seen that our health care is a world class joke. So sorry, that I'm sick of waiting.
It take 5 percent to get on the national debate stage. Unfortunately both parties rather screw over the poor and middle class. Obviously the conservatives are worse. But we truly need change. I've never voted 3rd party. But biden policy wise is a conservative.

Biden's campaign should hire someone whose entire job is to carry an airhorn &amp; follow Joe Biden everywhere he goes until election day. Any time Biden says something like "That reminds me of a funny story from way back.." they blast the airhorn continuously until the CO2 runs out.
I just realized how the electoral outlook could get even better for Biden, and it scares the 💩 out of me.
I thought Biden was going to lose bigly until the pandemic got so out of control. I thought it would be a Dukakis Wipeout. The BLM situation is hard to figure since Trump's response will bring out more black voters but it also riles up white conservatives

Biden doesn’t run this Twitter account.  Change my mind.

Biden is a feeble old man. Utterly devastating that this doddering, near 80 year old, near 50 year career politician, is the guy the democrat party went all in on on the eve of the SC primary. The party must never again be trusted with power.
That’s why Biden is proposing Medicare expansion and a public option. Those are the steps to get us to the European model of universal healthcare.

FWIW, the numbers have been pretty consistent lately. Biden's been ahead nationally by 5-10 pts every single day since mid-April in the polling average.   That amount of time is the same amount that remains until Election Day.
The obvious explanation would be that things changed between July 28th and Nov. 3, in a way that benefited Trump.  The polls tell you who is leading today.  Things could certainly change, but for now Biden is in a far better position than Trump.
Cline blaming DOJ corruption on Obama Biden  deepstate deepstate deepstate #BarrHearing
Looking at the 538 polling avg for 2016, it looks like the peak (after this date) was on 14 Aug, when HRC was ahead in the nationwide polling avg by 8.1 points.  Biden's now ahead by 8.2 in the same metric.   BUT that was literally a 1-day record for HRC.
AG Barr has been acting as Trump’s Fixer ever since he became President Trump’s Attorney General .  AG Barr should be impeached  AG Barr should be disbarred  The DOJ will need to recover from AG Barr’s reign of lies and deceit at the Department of Justice.  - VOTE FOR BIDEN -
At the dentist a trump ad came on the tv and it was an elderly lady and there was someone trying to break into her house so she called 911 and the line said "sorry no operators are availible" and she started crying then it said JOE BIDEN WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE
Covid. Biden. Trump. Debate. Cleveland. September. Covid.
- Biden agrees with you about Texas not going blue (via Teagan Goddard)- Joe Biden adviser:”Texas is 22 fucking media markets. That is never going to happen. It’s just not going to happen. Everyone knows that. I don’t know why people are still even talking about it.”
Biden’s inability to pick a running mate is bizarre. Just pick someone. Your VP doesn’t have to be your best friend. He should pick the person he thinks is most ready to be President if he dies. It’s that simple.
3 million extra votes for Hillary..  will be 15 million for biden..  and yea trumps doing great with the 150k americans dead... crashing economy.. your either delusional or the 12 yr old in the picture.
Do say? Lol😂🤣
Joe Biden Says Women Need His Help to Succeed in America
Biden and Obama are corrupt as all hell!
Joe Biden won’t be President ever
Former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner uses expletive to describe race between President Trump &amp; Joe Biden
If Biden picks a woman VP, we will PROBABLY have 4 more years of Trump the Dump. Why? Look at what happened to John McCain in 2008. He was leading Obama in polls big time. He Should've won. Until he picked a woman as VP.  Noboby wanted a woman VP then, doubt it will change now.
Any update on which if any VP candidates  are showing up at the Biden house?
Biden's policies paved the way for militarized police that murder black people. Something that until it became slightly less popular among white libs to do he was proud of. Him now saying that's bad means less than nothing. If Trump started saying Mexicans are cool with him after
I can’t wait until Biden fires him!
Been in corner of  for months now. I trust Vice President Biden on this one, whomever he chooses.
They’re facts. And You know those are all good things. This virus that pretty much is the only thing Lincoln Project can talk negatively about has inflicted EVERY nation. I know who fought for free trade deals that hurt my state greatly (Biden). And who caused mass incarceration
And Biden helped those racist bills pass and become laws
He’s done more for me and my family and friends than Biden did in his 40+ years in politics. Facts is, MY GENERATION is fighting the racist crime bills and laws that hurt black Americans.

If you dig in just a little bit, this does not look good for Trump.   The "anxious" question suggests Biden has a huge advantage in how motivated voters will be.
Policy over pandemonium. Biden.
Meanwhile joe Biden doesnt even know what tik tok is, and now is confused looking for a clock.
1. Sanders is Terrible Too Honestly. He has no Plan for How hes going to do ANYTHING hes Campaigned for.  2. Trumps smacking Pedo Biden
I will be showing up!!! But I'm Voting for Trump!! Because I dont support Pedo Biden Or The Pedophilic Democratic Party!! And I'm not wasting my Vote on Jo Jergonson.
Defector Media, your one-stop shop for scorching hot takes such as:  - Goodell bad - Manfred bad - Sports Guy bad - Trump bad - Biden bad - Athlete did stupid thing  Or, y'know, what you can get just from hitting up the top tweets on this hellsite.
Not disagreeing, but keep in mind, a Biden presidency almost certainly means at least 8 more years of no Medicare for All.  I'm voting for him in a swing state, but knowing that is a huge punch in the gut.
Why? So we can switch him out for Pedo Biden instead?
On my street ***TEN*** Biden signs. No tRump signs so far.😁
For those of you outside NE Ohio, the delicious irony of this may escape you.  The HEC Bldg of the Cleveland Clinic campus where this will be held was the site of the hospital's temporary Covid unit was set up.  Trump's most epic failure.
Trump...no question about it. He's not perfect, but Biden offers the nation absolutely nothing.But Biden...
You do realize that the other choice is someone who proves that he needs to be treated medically time and time again? I wouldn't be opposed to a new president, but not fucking Joe Biden.
And biden did the crime bill, where he asked for 60 "crimes" to be eligible for the death penalty. Right up to jaywalking. If you seriously think he's anywhere near a good person, you have issues. Also let's not forget that he sexually assaulted Reade as well while in office
Be careful what you wish fot Bernie. Biden is WAY worse. Just wait.

Biden holds daunting lead over Trump as US election enters final stretch
The country needs Biden to step down and let someone who actually supports the people and can finish a sentence run. Trump's going to whoop Biden's ass. We need a candidate who isn't a racist rapist.
Funny, everyone says Biden is beating Trump in polls, yet as I travel around I see Trump signs and flags everywhere, I've seen one Biden yard sign and no bumper stickers or anything. If Biden is winning it's a truly silent majority...
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I keep seeing anti-left posts like "bIdEn WaNtS tO gEt RiD oF gAs PoWeReD vEhIcLeS!" and like...wrong...but do ya'll know how dope that would be??? Not only SO MUCH better for the environment, but cheaper for you cause you don't buy gas!! Literally what's the problem???
Every American family deserves to see both Trump's financials AND the Biden documents...both candidates suck. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Biden was VP for 8 years, his policies are what created Trump's presidency. Handing power back to the crime ring  rejected in '16 isn't a solution, wouldn't even be considered if anyone had any sense at all. Trump is openly evil, much easier to fight than sneaky evil. #FvckTheDNC
Yet Trumps obvious Narcissism was not an issue  and he can pick out an elephant from a group of animals this is not rocket science people. And Biden will put competent people around him not the sycophants Trump put in place
Surely he cannot be as horrific as the fuck In Office now  the man cannot speak off the cuff about anything but how great he is. Biden is an empathetic man and it comes across. Never saw that from the orange buffoon  and Biden will put smart people around him. Not sycophants.
He was definitely better than Joe Biden.
Same could be said about any arbitrary number. Biden is a poor candidate. Democrats would shit on trump in the election if they got a decent candidate but they are all too radically left or fucking dumb.I don't know how anyone can truly believe Trump has the best interest of anyone other than Trump. I can't wait to vote for Biden.
I can tell you Trump has been running ridiculous ads about Biden for the last month or so in Ohio. Every YouTube video I watch has like 3 ad breaks &amp; almost ALL the ads are Trump ads about the police not being able to help if you’ve been raped. Truly disgusting stuff.

The only time Biden can read a sentence without stuttering is when there's a teleprompter in front of him.
True, but Trump as a person aside, Biden's viewpoints align with mine far more than Trump's.
What are they talking about he sounds fine to me!!!!                                                           Joe Biden Tripped Up Badly by Running Mate Question... 'I'm Having a 2-Hour, Uh, Um, Vetting Report'
I believe so, but Trump is to stupid to see that.  Vote Biden.
Meaning; it won't get any better under Biden's leadershipHow much did pelosi feinstein hunter biden earn
Since Biden plans to lose Ohio to Trump, can I vote 3rd party or is that still giving Trump the election?
No doubt.  You have a place in Biden/Harris cabinet, I have no doubt!

L Biden better lose by a landslide or this country going to shit
I hope that we finally get rid of the moronavirus that's in the White house and  finally #EndTheNightmare on November 3rd and that Biden crushes Trump in the election🙏🤞
It's Fake News!! The People that Died will be mail in Voting For Biden!!!     Kidding Of Course.
Joe Biden will kick his ass in a debate
You do know Obama and Biden brought the economy back and Trump claimed it but thank God now he can't run on Obama's economy he's running on his own
I remember reading Republicans are giving him till labor day to turn things around vs Biden. Their best course of action would be to back impeachment and run Pence on the ticket to try and save the Senate.
Starting to see Biden signs go up in my Ohio neighborhood 😁
US election: Biden pledges billions to improve racial equality
Makes Biden's VP pick especially important.
I refuse to withhold my criticisms of Joe Biden.
And that relevant how? My believes are completely consistent. If it's the Trump creep show where he has been recorded making comments on the appearance of underage girls vs photos of what Biden kissing a little girls head grabbing a lady's face (with no context).
So Dan is supporting the pedo Biden...ok
Trump will not save us. Biden will not save us. No political leader will save us. It is Christ who saves. Politicians can do good, but they cannot fix what ails us most of all. They cannot renew our hearts and defeat death.
If  just said I’ll be competent he get my vote.
You can't tell me Joe Biden and Donald Trump are the same. Only one of them killed Jamal Kashoggi and Herman Cain.
Don’t stop speaking out. I spent hours yesterday being shit on by BBs. One of them said they literally wanted RBG to die. Another one said I was MAGA and against BLM because I will support Biden in Nov. They are truly nuts
You’re so outraged but say nothing about Clinton and Gore! I also assume you won’t be voting for Biden? He raped/violated at least 8 women!!!! Don’t be a hypocrite!!!
Biden literally was on top of the polls throughout the primary until Warren knocked him below 20 pts lmao
I just do not get the change of heart.  We have a pandemic that stopped a very robust economy.  Do you really think Joe Biden who wants to increase taxes and regulations is the answer?
When do the Harris/Biden bumper stickers come out.. I am a Trumpster...but I would put that on my car...#Biden2020 #Trump2020 #Democrats #BLM #MLB
Journalists are obsessed with Twitter. How is that for journalism? Also, forget Twitter when it comes to mental acuity or decorum, that's another issue in itself. A main issue is that Joe Biden is not up to speed. Unless it's on a Teleprompter or he has a handler
Stop saying facts about the Biden camp!!!
Biden finally Unveils Plan to Fight Racial Inequality after 40 years in public office. 🤣
It’s just sad AF that ppl truly believe Biden is a better choice
You will be calling more than balls &amp; strikes if Biden wins.
Biden knows it isn’t safe to return our youth to school. Putting our educators and administrators at risk doesn’t help anyone and will only serve to spread this disease further. Remote learning should be the norm at least for the first semester.
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?
I don’t think so. They’ve stood by while he’s sold us out to hostile nations, put kids in cages, supported white supremacy ... the list grows daily. Anyone not voting Biden is allowing it all to continue.
If that were the case no Democrats should have gone. Joe Biden spits more racial slurs in a day than David Duke does in a year.
So I suggest you vote for Biden, higher taxes which will decimate middle class, defunding good police along/bad, invite China to continue spying within our borders, allow illegal immigrants to flood country, stop energy programs that employ millions. That's to start. He's yours.
No, those stats were not true and whatever countries may laugh will need due to the President holding them responsible for not pulling their fair share. Let them laugh. Obama, Biden and Co attempted to drive Trump from office which is treason. Indictments coming.
Biden did nothing the 8 years he was vice president... except profit for his junkie son and him self...
I feel like you think youre in charge of a lot of shit that you arent. Haha. I’m voting for Biden. A lot of people are. Bye.
They’ll push ANY other story in their blatant attempt at keeping the corrupt Biden’s out of the news.  Biden is only running for  to keep safe from prosecution.
Everyone I talked to says what are we going to do If Biden gets in. With the crooks in the world who could change mail in ballots and replace them with new ones.
Russian interference was proven. I’m not suggesting anything. Centrists are just fine with Biden. Not worried.
I’m going out on a limb...Biden will NOT be the candidate.  Something crazy will happen at the Democratic Convention.  If I’m right you heard it first!
YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND DEBATE BIDEN
If you hate biden so much then close your eyes and see RBG’s name. She won’t live another 4 years. The least we can give her is someone who will replace her with a non-frat boy
If there is a Clinton, Biden, or Obama sticker on the Bumper safely assume it’s a Pedophile Mobile.  They were all in bed with Epstein.
Do you see what Trump is doing daily? Do you know what he did today? Stfu now with Biden. I will take ANY adult over a child at this point. I’ll take my 20th candidate over him. I’ll do what it takes to save the citizens of this country
Also, you’re just mad Bernie is out. We got what we got. It’s Biden or Trump. That’s the choice. There is no other choice. If someone offered you literal shit to eat or decent but not perfect meal, you gonna really eat shit or starve to death? Stop being a 2 year old
Just a reminder, if he was a Biden supporter you'd be saying things like "he just made a mistake!" and "don't ruin a young life for one case of bad judgement!".  #LiberalHypocrisy
I’m sorry...dumbass  says what...
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
If this was 20 years ago, Biden would probably be described as being on the right. Don’t see how he’s a socialist.
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.
Those troops likely aren't going anywhere. It will take months of planning just to figure out where they're going. By the time they'd be ready to move, President Biden will cancel the order with day one executive orders.
Nobody cares about where you were born and really at this point in the game, we don't care if you vote for Biden or not.  This election is to important.  Biden or Trump; sorry it's a no brainer
At least 40% of people will believe him too...  Either way it won't be an easy win unless Biden pulls it off on Election night
If my district is right, Biden narrowly gets it
my goal is Nov. 5th. 24 hours after Biden wins and I celebrate the fuck out of that win.
Oh so, you are racist! Nice. Good to know. Biden has moved toward nearly everything Bernie wanted but it still isn’t good enough for you babies.
I've been shouting this out for awhile... You're NOT voting for Biden... You're voting for his VP... wake the phuk up!!!!
I think Biden will be a 1 termer, and Harris will probably replace him (or whoever is his VP)
Not all of them. I don't think Cheney was looking to run after Bush. And Biden likely calls it a career and lets the next generation try to win back the White House if a "normal" Republican had won in 2016.
It would be wild to see Biden reanimate one of those dead segrationist senators he worked so well with in the 60s or whenever, create an unstoppable zombie old white man vote-getting ticket, then stake them thru the heart post-election and appoint Stacey Abrams. And then retire.
Biden midterm could be rough.  Will probably see some disappointing surprises
Lolz. Hahahahaha. You’re hilarious. I am actually voting for the guy who has the most black support of all candidates. He was my 7th pick but I care about who POC want and they want Biden.
Hahahahah. You’re so ridiculous. No, Tara lied to try to harm Biden but Biden’s support was too big for Bernie and his loser bots
Never pegged you for pro Biden
What could possibly be worst then the catastrophic failure destroying our country right now ? Biden is the bridge out of hell and everyone needs to get on it. We cannot do 4 more of the last 4!! #RidinWithBiden
Surprised she didn't get more attention from the Biden campaign tbh
This is exactly correct, but the Veep spot has definitely also been a high profile launching pad for a run for the Presidency. This attempt to derail Harris may be from people who have other favored candidates in mind after Biden, and want to stop Harris now.
I agree on  . Since her crap campaign ended, she has been excellent on Covid recovery economics. She'll slice and dice Pence in debate. Rice is foreign policy centric, something Biden will not need partnership on. Harris is the perfect age a d competence.
Just by trump saying she'd be a fine pick makes me now hope Biden doesn't pick her. Remember he praises Bernie. Why? Because he would rather face hin then Biden. Just saying.
None of that has to do with how news media companies work. They have templates of things they know are going to happen soon enough already in the can. We all know Biden is going to pick the next Veep in a week or two, and we all know the shortlist.
You know what the Biden campaign needs?  A campaign song
Regarding VP I don't want Biden to pick a leftist because then that means a leftist has to campaign for him
Biden has way too much bagage that will be thrust on him in debates he wont be able to ride out or ignore. Dems cant get out of their own way even in a sitch where the perpetually spineless right should get flogged and the cancel fad will end his WH bid in stunning fashion.
So you are OK with four more years of Trump, which will likely result in a dictatorship. Then, your issues will become irrelevant. The fight in November is to save the country from Trump.  The only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Everything else has to be set aside for now.
Y'all seriously can't tell me Biden would ignore a Supreme Court decision.
And yet you support this president! Come out and say you’re supporting Joe Biden for President if you’re really concerned! #Biden2020
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Y’all president rescinded the low income housing bill that Obama/Biden enacted. Another racist act by a racist president. Get this man out of office.
If Bernie was elected nothing would change.  If you want to see change it needs to done down ballot   Quit bashing Biden.  You’re no better than Trump
I’m happy everyone is on the Biden train, i made this pic before he announced he was running I've been #BideOrDie becuz it looked like trump was just trying to oppress us, i just never expected he’d try to kill us with a #pandemic also🤦🏽‍♀️ nvr trust #WhiteSupremacists 2protect you!
Joe Biden hasn't announced his running mate yet. That looks like a Bernie Bro, a bot, or a troll did it to get a reaction.
Those ~3 months between Trump losing and Biden being sworn in are going to be fucking nuts
Sad to read. A bite for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. Biden will get you closer to democratic socialism solutions. Healthcare, food, housing for starts. Vow to remove Trump. That is step 1.
This is something the theater command will have an order counteracting for President Biden to sign within hours of his inauguration.
Because they would have a write-up like this for all the leading candidates so they can publish it literally the minute Biden actually announces it. Like obituaries for geezer famous people.
Biden: I’m going to prosecute anarchists.  *Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vancetti have joined the chat*

congrats on campaign once in a lifetime opportunity! But you say vote Biden if you took bipartisan out of it it’s like your promoting lesser of 2 evils which is not what I got from you when you were campaigning why now ? You have been bought by Biden obviously!
The worst part is in 2021 I can’t wait for the GOP to accuse President Biden of treason the minute he doesn’t declare war on Russia for the smallest dispute. Suddenly they will be hawks again.
ONE DAY, IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE, YOU'LL DISAPPEAR.   That day will come in January 2021 when Joe Biden takes the oath to become president. That day can't get here soon enough.

Today’s leak nonwithstanding, there is still a nonzero chance that Joe Biden picks Julia Louis-Dreyfus for his Veep
I couldn't get one kid out of the shitter and back to his machine for a half hour and it made me empathize with Jill Biden.
Yeah and stupid people in the suburbs will vote Biden because Trump hurts their feelings
Kamala Harris has been chosen as the standard bearer for black civil rights leaders, and was thus Biden's best choice. She's still garbage and we absolutely primarily her when/if Biden gets in office.
Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris. Although I absolutely despise Khive because they're disingenuous grifters, this was the best choice
If Biden was 1/100th as corrupt as Trump and running against a decent human being, I woukd not vote for him.
"Trump = Biden" is the other wing of the "communists = socialists = liberals = neoliberals" BS conservatives believe
These ads claiming that if Biden is president there won't be cops is hilarious when some of Biden's voting history has been borderline conservative. These ads are straight up propaganda now. They're not even trying to hide it.
Rice is more than qualified to take over as President if, god forbid, Joe Biden dies.
Biden lives in his Basement... so what’s the big deal?? #HidingBiden #BasementBiden
HAHDBSBS WHY Biden snap like that 🤣🤣👎🗑
Will he actually try to do it?  If so, I agree these would be bold moves.  I'd rather have Medicare for All, but this would be better than current.  I don't trust Biden to actually do it.
Yes, putting limits on our insurance companies and/or providing a public option would be an improvement.  We gotta do something bold.  Do you trust Biden to do something bold?
I am including his VP in the "remove Biden" category. Realistically, the left has a better chance dragging the GOP to the left than they do dragging the DNC to the left. The DNC looks to the GOP for cues.
I genuinely think it sends a stronger message to prop up and remove Biden
Yes, after Obama made a few phone calls urging all the other centrists to drop out and endorse Biden.
That wasn't an accident. The DNC moved to the right with biden. You misunderstand.
I didn't vote last time and they moved to the right with Biden, my street got shot up and my family got COVID. I think I'd rather accelerate POTUS changes until someone ponies up and fixes shit.
Joe Biden won't quit because he can't even get started, unless it profits him or someone else in his circle.
I understand the grievances against Biden. But how many of us are in Trump's list of "anarchists"?
How dare these liberals treat our AG like he’s a moron!! This is all their way of campaigning for stupid Joe Biden!! They’re not going to let him answer ANY questions!!
Yang did a semi-subtle call out on that DNC vote on M4A policy. Bernie supporters are replying to him with the "BuT yOu EnDoRsEd BiDeN" And I'm like mother Fulkerson I basically did too so stfu.
I'm sure that will help with outreach to young voters.
Except the vast majority of people support his plan. They voted for Biden out of belief in Biden's electability over Trump, and the exit polls show that. Insistence on private insurance and competition is insistence on the market, so yes, you are insisting that.
Because the dominant belief among democrats after March 2nd was that Joe Biden had the plurality of support, and he went on to easily clinch that plurality. Holding a grudge over Andrew's endorsement instead of working for M4A isn't helping.
(1) Andrew Yang was correct to endorse Biden (2) Andrew Yang has been incorrect in not pushing more publicly and heavily for healthcare, and that'a a genuine obstacle to a future run in politics that his fans so desperately want (3) Cut the guy some slack, he's a human being.

As far as I’m concerned there is only one choice, Joe Biden yaaaaa 👏💕
This is Democrat’s doing so electing Biden will get this ten fold until America is destroyed Karen 😡🤬🖕🏼
Back when we had a thoughtful, intelligent president who listened to the experts on his team. It’s a beautiful photograph, a snapshot from a historic presidency. You must love Stanford, but if Biden calls on you, please be open to helping his admin correct the course.
Look at Local 12 trying to protect Biden's decline
That moment the ground shifts under the people who said it was great we off-shored our critical health care manufacturing capacity. #Covid19 woke up everyone. If they survived the virus assault w/out N95 😷 No where to hide now.  #reshore #madeinusa 🇺🇸
Didn’t Hunter Biden do something similar to this in the Ukraine??
Yes, only two of the three. One of the three will most likely be a draw, or a Biden win somehow. Depending on the category of discussion, I don't remember a time when a politician swept a series of presidential debates. Perhaps Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton, but not sure.
“People understand that a somewhat blind faith in free trade is producing undesirable results.” Well, yeah. But never doubt the intransigence of the offshoring mob.
How about the time he said Joe Biden had it in his plan that he wanted to defund the police? Blatant lie. Or the time he said the virus was at five and would be down to zero. Blatant lie.
Show what it is now with biden he is losing
You may or may not recall Rrump rescinded a lot of trans rights that were put in place in the last 8 years. Biden is liable to reinstate those. $15/MW, college debt forgiveness for those making 5 figures or less/year and public option healthcare all benefit people who are not me.
Recovering from the "Mother of All Hangovers," then rolling up my sleeves to help get America back on track.  Defeating the Abomination in Chief is the beginning. We have so much damage to repair now &amp; there's no telling how much more harm he'll do before Biden is inaugurated.
Biden did not win because of his platform.  80 to 90% of Democrats support Medicare for All.
I did same, needed to reread. 👀 They are definitely rooting for Biden.
Any vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. If you prefer Trump over Hawkins, well, best of luck.
Condi is a Repub., don’t think Biden will choose her. Susan Rice would be a most excellent choice.
More likely to get a check from Biden, too
Interestingly, I think the debates will not swing many votes at all this time around. I see Trump winning two of the three, mostly because Trump thinks faster than Biden.
I'm not voting for Biden because of any of the fairytale bullshit. I get absolutely nothing out of voting for Biden. Not a single, solitary thing. Other people benefit and that's worth it to me.
The depths of his indifference remains incomprehensible. What an asshole The Independent: Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol.   via
Why on earth would Biden let someone accused of sexual assault be on his VP selection committee!?
You think Biden will provide any of this?  44 years in politics and hasn’t produced anything close to this.  How could you be fooled he all of a sudden will?
It's either kamala or Warren. Biden would be a fool to look outside the primary. Well, rephrase, his advisors would be fools
I love Susan for VP. And, she already knows the workings of the WH. Her and Biden make a full house.
Yes, she had her hand in that alright. Biden wrote the rules. You think together they can get those crime laws straightened out?
Her reputation is lousy on that one. What can I say, Biden wrote the legislation, she just carried it out. You think, together they can get that changed
Khive is trying to turn Black Lives Matter against Biden advisors. Sanders delegates are demanding healthcare. We are seeing the fissure grow.
Amigo can you share with me when AOC challenges Speaker Pelosi?  That is never happening.  She has been set straight.  Sanders is compromised otherwise why would he endorse Biden who is against M4All! No Democrat is standing up for PEACE. Rs &amp; Ds both fund the MIC #DemExit #Peace
From Steve Chapman a thoughtful conservative on Trump’s exaggerations and fear-mongering: Will Joe Biden destroy the suburbs? No. No president had such power.
Ive done it. Trump is one and the same with Clinton, Epstein, Obama, Biden, etc. Birds of a feather. He has endless documentation of his relationship and friendship with all the big wigs pulling the strings. We can disagree on this because you're right, the truth will come out.
Disappointed that Biden turned down an equal time interview with Mike Wallace at Fox News. This maneuver reminds me of the basketball team that's leading,  holds the ball for the last 5 minutes, momentum changes and they lose.#comeoutofthenasement
I swear to god  better turn off his hearing aid when talking with Chris Dodd. #KamalaHarrisForVP
It's not literally impossible for Biden to win by 7 and lose the EC, but it's vanishingly unlikely; it would mean state polls are missing badly, together, but in different directions, which basically never happens.
Biden is not the President, tho. You should be trying to beat HIM. I mean, you would if you weren't actually trying to help him with this foolery.
Biden’s plan doesn't provide universal health care.
Biden's plan doesn't provide health care to everyone.
Biden still does not know about the virus
Trump is starting the violence, Trumps guys beat up a vet standing with his hands in his pocket. Where's Joe Biden? Well every week he's putting out policies that will help bring this country back to normal
I did a quick search.... so is all to Kamala’s debating prowess, that she didn’t bow down and kiss Biden’s ass when she was RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?!?!!
Goodbye Mr. Criminal President. I hope the new AG for Biden holds you accountable for your crimes. #2020Election #Biden2020
And Biden has a media that will lie for him.......see you as an example
Yeah I saw the "Biden wants to remove the police" thing, which as far as I know he has never said anything remotely close to that
Seriously??..
Ask him again after he naps.  #FoxNews
Huh?   Biden cures Racism and a Virus?  I mean if so im in man.....but
Biden is refusing to provide health care as a right while Hawkins isn't. It's pretty simple.
Literally 100,000s more people will die if Joe Biden is elected over Howie Hawkins. People shouldn't have to die in order to allow corporations to maintain control over this country.
If I were Biden, I wouldn't even recognize Fox News existence.

Democrats when Elizabeth Warren is running for president: LOL she's so racist she tried to claim she's 1/1024 NA! Democrats after Warren endorses Biden: Look, it's racist to call Warren "Pocahontas," what she did wasn't all that bad, she's fantastic
Trump is President right? So why are they Biden’s protest?

Please, register to vote. Get out to vote. Your only chance to make a difference is to vote and to encourage your friends and family to vote.  Save our Republic and vote for Joe Biden.
I also see why he wouldn’t support Biden. My issue lies with the fact that either trump or Biden will win this election.  He is throwing a wrench in this that could go either way.  He isn’t going to win anything. The last thing we need is more chaos.
In his last manic episode he “supported trump”. In this one he “denounced trump”. So, that’s not a thing. Trump is racist. Google some shit before you start asking me for receipts. I’m not doing that. Biden isn’t a known racist. If he “supported Biden” it would make more sense.
Suburb of Dayton Ohio.  One Biden sign.  Trump everywhere
Weird how the only thing I've seen Biden say in a while is that ad where he and Obama talk about Trump saying, "I don't take responsibility" Biden's most effective strategy is flying under the radar and it's just weird.
At least be truthful, you know that isn’t Biden’s sloganI feel a lot better about Trump's chances now than I did a month ago. He can easily win if he keeps doing what he's doing, and if Joe Biden suffers some blows (VP pick, debates, October surprise)
Biden is gonna announce a surprise VP pick and I know who it’ll be. Pete Buttigieg in Drag! What’s his drag name?
come on Bron endorse Biden and let’s movem on from the Trump assholes!
It will be worse than 2016 because if he loses this he could go to prison.   Another good reason to vote for Biden
He tweeted that he beat Obama 4 years ago. And he wants us to believe Biden has dementia.  #TrumpIsNotWell  #TrumpIsJealousOfObama
Karen Bass is about the least exciting running mate I could imagine. Maybe only slightly ahead of Gretchen Whitmer. Just pick Warren or Kamala.
Elizabeth Warren leads all the polls, especially in demographics where Biden is weak. She is the one candidate for VP ready to hit the ground running with the policy chops and the receipts to help lead us out of this desperate crisis.
I feel like Monday Joe Biden will announce his VP pick.

Biden says it will be next week.
Imagine making a racist post to defend a woman who locked up more black men than Joe Biden's 94' crime bill. Mediocre defines your intelligence.
Sadly, Biden has literally forgotten everything he knew.
The biggest lie: "In Joe Biden's America you and your family will never be safe." THE BIGGEST LIE. We are not safe under this president.
There is nothing stopping Biden from picking Jimmy Carter as his VP
I was literally just joking about how a Biden-Kaine ticket is the funniest possible outcome, even funnier than a Biden-Clinton ticket
The filibuster was used as a weapon against Obama to block his every move. If republicans retain the senate and Biden wins, they’ll do the same to Joe. #cnn
Yeah, her name kind of came out of nowhere over the past couple weeks. I think Chris Dodd and Ed Rendell were both pushing for her to be Biden's running mate.
Biden's woman VP pick would have great chance to be POTUS for 2025.There are so many old farts &amp; fake macho Alphas who can't stand woman in power.VP candidate will have to go through hell
My prediction is that Biden will pick a VP and that person will be a member of the Democratic Party.
Yep, she's been my pick since Biden essentially won the nomination. I actually would have liked to see her as the nominee, but VP works too, as well as AG. I guess what I'm saying is I support the cloning of Kamala Harris. lol.
Michael you're late to the party bruh.  I've been saying this since the Dodd leak.  It is a great strategy to build support for Kamala and to make Biden look like "his own man".  But now that the campaign has the attention they need to make it real and soon.  Like tomorrow.
Thank you Mr Biden..
I think that would backfire bc it gives Trump more fake ammo to scare voters. He has run out of material on Biden so he can’t wait until VP is picked so he can rail on them.
As far as I can see he's at least been using his money for good. Millions to climate change efforts and renewable energy, and between he and his wife, over a million to Biden.
The ONLY reason Biden is the nominee is because we can’t afford four more years of trump. That’s it. He shouldn’t forget it.
Declare public health emergency and now Biden has a HHS slush fund.  That's just as bad but you know if that's how they're going to play it...
He can remove a lot of those judges Trump put on the courts.The case can be made the a lot of them were not vetted and not even qualified to be on the bench.Also Trump put a rapist on the SCOTUS and backed a pedo to run for the senate.Biden can remove al lest half of them
See you tomorrow Senior Biden Adviser
Has Biden been rehearsing the entire event, so that he doesn’t have to “freestyle”, Sounding like a complete bumbling idiot?
Just the last gasps of white male privilege. Decision is Biden's. Accuse  of ambition? This from 2 guys who mounted exploratory campaigns for president in years past. What's wrong with being ambitious? Joe Biden's ambition for the presidency is decades old.
Yeah I'm sure MSNBC will definetly not get a body language expert to come on and tell us how Biden was really lying about the who think

Joe Biden... a caring president!
I dont have to pick until Nov, if Biden is still making dumb ass statements like that then who knows how I vote. That being said as a responsible voter I'm going to call out the dumb shit and praise the good stuff. I'm not a cheer leader who blindly follows
That's all I want is a party that cares about me and my fellow man, biden adopting a better environmental plan is great but having 1 plan out of many bad ones doesnt rise to the occasion. Espeically with all the terrible ppl he has surrounded himself with.

Nope, we can go back to normal life only after the election, and only if Biden wins. That’s the Democrat strong arm strategy.

Please link me to the article about how party insiders were starting a never Biden movement or how the superdelegates were planning to damage the party 2 stop Buttigieg, or how the donors were ready to jump ship over Kamala. At least Warren spooked them as much as bernie did
Right after all this buildup for Kamala and Biden is waiting???  Makes no sense.  I still think it is coming tomorrow.
You're delusional if you think they covered him with anything approaching fair and balanced, but it doesnt matter you guys got you wish Bernie's out and we have the slow car wreck that is Biden against the horrific car wreck that is trump. Go stan for you boy Biden bc I wont
Ok, two good decisions. Then what? Disaster! How stupid do you think people are? Biden 2020 in a walk!
Loyal is such a dumb, click bait way to put it.  How about like this: would Harris, the Democratic Party, or the American people be better off if Biden selects her to be his VP candidate?  IMHO, the answer to all 3 is no, but not because of loyalty; VP is a suck job for most.
Please not her Biden is bad enough
Let hope warren is Biden’s VP  .We can’t be that lucky they announce it today
I'm not characterizing it as anything. And you haven't done anything like that.  If you're not voting for Biden, it's one less vote against Trump. You're secure because NY is so blue, but plenty of the country isn't, and if enough people think like you, NY wouldn't be either.
This is Biden’s decision, nobody else’s.
Are you aware I voted for Bernie in the primaries?  The primaries are the place for that idealism. There isn't a place for that in a two-party electoral system like we have coming up.  One will be president, if you're not supporting Biden, you're supporting Trump. Full stop.
Biden is - no matter your political train of thought - far further away from fascism then Trump, and isn't a racist or white supremacist.  One of them will be president, so you're either voting for Biden or helping elect the racist, white supremacist traitor.
I don’t know much about Karen Bass but I do know she’s said she won’t run for pres after being Biden’s VP (unlike Kamala Harris). Being VP helps build a post-Biden campaign for president, especially if he only serves 1 term. Seems like a long term strategic blunder picking Bass.
The fact that Biden seems unable to bring a halt to *on the record* comments of this nature (to say nothing of the anonymous leaks) is an ominous sign going forward.
And another thing. Project lincoln are republicans trying to save their party from Trump.  They have no affiliation with Biden other than the same goal. Beat trump in November.  So whatever bad message you think it's sending, has nothing to do with Biden.
Reminder: Biden first said he was for it. Now, he may be against it; it’s unclear. Then again, so is he.
No of course you dont, biden will win simply bc of how terrible trump is.
Only 1 person shook the hand of a known KKK member and called him a great man !! Only 1 man called blacks “ Predators” and co sponsored 3 bills that mass incarcerated blacks ! Only 1 person called blacks “jungle bunnies” that would be Biden!!
Cool we get it you hate bernie... good job you won Bernie lost and will never be president. Now you dont have to worry about his stupid ideas anymore. Go and promote Biden while he says all the wrong thing and democrats do the bare minimum. At least you can say u stopped bernie
After her constant attacks on the Democratic Party she should be launched into the sun.

Biden just needs to pick his VP already and get rid of all this dumb speculation before it devolves further into "Should Biden pick Rashida Tlaib" territory

Policy-wise, I think Warren is the best pick for VP, however:  Biden pretty much promised an AA woman would be the pick &amp; it would be TONE DEAF in the face of the BLM protests to ignore that.  Harris’ seat is safely blue. Warren’s is not.  Biden needs a strong orator/mouthpiece.
Yeah his supporters are wild. Granted &amp; like you said, Biden is creepy as hell too but to act like tr*mp isn’t, is a damn lie.

Which is an absurd position. Joe Biden was instrumental with the crime bill of 94 and has done nothing for the black community. Obama didn't either. I will never vote republican but joe biden ain't it.
trump is a neo-fascist biden is a neoliberal  neither comparison is remotely accurate
Then Obama chose unwisely as Biden did have intentions of running for President in 2016 and obviously 2020.

Oddly, your list of "accomplishments" is fairly subjective. One person's opinion. ANY president would be expected to do much of it, just as part of their job. And it includes a rather lengthy list of Executive Orders, which were often considered dictatorial prior to 2017.
If Biden wins in November, he'll let the Far Left continue. If Trump wins, the Far Left will use that to justify their continued actions. Either way prepare for a shit show. #Election2020
This is twitter. The "IMO" is implied, as it is for almost everyone else here.
Biden and Trump need to go head to head in several competitions.  *Do a reading comprehension from a standardized test *An athletic competition(not golf) *Give us their plans for the next 4 yrs with graphs, charts bullet points ect *Cabinet member nominees
If three or four decades of very public chicanery can't influence your opinion of a person, what can? This is twitter. It's my opinion. I'm not a journalist.
Has more affinity for or dictatorial adversaries than our democratic allies. Throws military parades for himself. Demands loyalty above all else. Takes Russia's word over our own intelligence. Lots of reasons.
Fancies himself above the law. Can't be investigated, prosecuted. Has mused about being president for multiple terms--multiple times. Talks of postponing the election. Has fixers. He certainly is surrounded by fawning sycophants. Thinks FOX should be his personal Pravda...
Here's Biden eulogizing Strom Thurmond 7/1/2003:

Sure. But everything in Donald Trump's character (or lack thereof) tells me he doesn't do anything that isn't in his own self-interest. At best, it was likely a CYA move, to avoid implicating his properties. At worst, it was a trade to avoid personal hot water. All IMO naturally.
What I'm saying is, if he cut off contact, or even acted as a witness, there are innumerable reasons he could have done so, not all of them altruistic. He could very well have been acting in his own self-interest.

He will bring America’s economic and job growth to a halt and we will likely fall into a recession or possibly a depression under Biden. We need a successful businessman during this rebound period. Do not take a chance on someone new. Vote for who is effective. Trump has proven
I know this is a massive liberal platform which is why I must — TRUMP 2020! Wake up, stop being brainwashed by the mainstream media. It’s false and biased. They have their own agenda and I can assure you, as a political science and criminal justice graduate, Biden IS NOT capable
Imagine saying this about Biden and simultaneously ignoring Trump's 18 accusers.
If you miss a president who can speak in complete sentences, I would be correct in assuming you would not be voting for Biden? Because apparently he cannot even walk without being led by staffers.
The only reason people support Biden is one brainwashing, secondly it’s the trump haters that rather have trump removed, even if it means voting for someone who is incompetent, mentally ill, and has weak policies and supports illegals and criminals more than avg American
BLM and other Marxists extremist groups play a huge factor in the elections. They have managed to influence the Democratic Party and using the moderates as mere puppets for their socialist radical ways. Biden is weak. No one supports Biden because they have faith in him.
I am a conservative republican and trump supporter and will vote trump 💯 but I do see that his chances are slim. It’s frightening and alarming to think Biden managed to get this far SOMEHOW. people need to get informed on the issues and look beyond mainstream media before voting
we as in BIDEN, then yes we agree, lol
Well, at least the second thing is still a possibility if Biden wins and they decide to actually go after these guys for all their obvious crimes and abuses of office.

Even if there were no other reasons to vote Biden, THIS should be all the reason you need 🤣🔥
If Joe Biden made Michelle Obama his VP, we would kinda have him back...
Waiting for  virtual town hall to start, and am excited to hear their positions. I have another Zoom meeting tomorrow to learn about Joe Biden’s platform on coming back as a better America for our minority neighbors.
It would be great if there was a realistic 3rd choice. Maybe perfection would be right around the corner. I'm all for it. Possibly if Biden wins this one, in 20 yrs,that might happen. If Trump wins this one, it doesn't happen in 50 yrs. It's that simple.Put out the 🔥.Re-assert.
Doesn’t have one. But let’s not act like Biden won’t need to make some changes to the current system.
our family group chat has become an absolute joke of bashing Biden (I don’t support him either) but I speak one word about trump and I’m ignored or reprimanded like a child. Someone add me to their family group chat.
I'm shocked that nobody is actually seeing the real story here. This whole episode proves one thing and one thing only... Joe Biden is a witch and he needs to be put on trial for it!!! Nobody other than a witch can accurately predict what Trump is going to do!!! /s
It doesn’t help the USPS NOW. Ensuring that our ballots arrive where they should on time will allow Joe Biden to save USPS after he wins the election. First things first.
Joe Biden's plan for women has only made women angry because he is telling them how to run their lives. Women don't need Joe Biden's help. Biden is saying that women don't make as much money as men do which is not true it all depends on the job. Another failed Biden idea.
Under Biden, we likely would have went into a recession at the very least — possibly a depression. Our country never experienced anything like that before. Many should be thankful trump is president
#MikePompeoWrongAgain &amp; a giant 💩 The election is not up to the Justice Department  or POTUS READ THE CONSTITUTION All your posturing will only ensure that either Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden will be sitting in the Oval on January 20, 2021.
The current state of our politics is in no way usual. There is nothing normal about the current POTUS. I believe him to be an existential threat to our democracy. I don't care if Joe Biden is only 10% on my checklist politically, he's better than what we have.
4/Again, if it goes to the Supreme Court to decide the election, I am pretty confident that they will put Biden in office.    5/Spend your time telling people to register and vote.  STOP SCARING PEOPLE SO THEY WON'T REGISTER OR VOTE.  5/ Democracy itself is on the line.
Oh and you realize that had Biden been president we would have lost at least another 3-5 million Americans because Biden (and professionals) were ORIGINALLY against trumps travel bans and restrictions? They have since admitted he was right. Masks are/should be a CHOICE
That still won't keep  in office.  According to the 20th Amendment, he's dumped on January 20....and Nancy Pelosi would fill the gap until the election is called...and given the Supreme Court to decide (a la 2000) Biden will be appointed like they did George Bush.
Let’s be real, he may be a little brash and bold, he may tweet random stuff at times and be a bit strange but.. there’s one thing no one can deny — he gets shit done! The alternative DOES NOT. Biden is lost and incompetent. We need someone bold who is up to the job. #Trump2020

2000: Bush 2004: Bush 2008: McCain 2012: Romney 2016: Johnson 2020: Biden  #WeWillVote
Man, for a professor you sure are pretty dense. Biden didn't say Trump would stop the election, he said he would "try to come up with some rationale to kick it back". That's exactly what Trump did today. Stop being a pompous ass and just admit you were wrong.
Go away Gary. Obama and Biden put kids in cages. Biden championed legislation that put vast numbers of minorities in prison.
*I* am aware of that. It's the "Values Voters" who have for decades made noise about that. Funny how that all went out the window for the most morally flawed President in our history.  And Joe Biden, Marxist? How absolutely absurd.
I almost don’t want Biden to win because I think the Senate will flip to Dems and House will remain Dem held with even more Dems being added and then Trump can’t do shit
We will vote on November 3.  We will vote for Joe Biden. We will vote blue down the ballot. We will restore honor to our country. We will safe our democracy. #WeWillVote
I mean we absolutely should protest regardless of the president. It was Bernie who said his plan to get legislation passed was to amass a national movement to put pressure on local reps. Even if Biden is on our side this needs to happen.
Trump running ads on his COVID record says a lot about why he’s getting killed by Biden from coast to coast.
The money will be donated to Hunter Biden's charity foundation.
He did say “Retweet” even tho this poll appears biased. It’s Senator Biden. And soon to be “former President” Tr*mp. Only 46 votes tho, I think we can make this more accurate.
👉DESPERATE &amp;👉PARANOID MUCH? &amp;🤔IRT COVID?👉 CURRENT ADMINISTRATION *IS OBLIGATED BY LAW* don, TO TURN OVER *ALL* INFO OBTAINED IRT PANDEMICS, VACCINES, ETC.. So 🤔DON'T think for a minute that a vaccine cure *in the works* WON'T BE PASSED TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. IT WILL!
Are you looking forward to Biden hanging Trump's?
Rick Lucas, President,  asked  a question at the  conference. Start the video on 1:42:25. "How will the Biden admin. ensure the health inadequacies of COVID-19 doesn't happen again?" #Nurses2020 #COVID19 #frontlineworkers
And this after in April when Biden camp said he’d pull this and the right analysts were like “absolutely not! No evidence!” He’s only saying this cuz GDP had the largest Q2 contraction since the late 40s I believe.
So if Joe wins, you’re moving to another country? America can only hope Biden wins if so.
A dog peeing on a fire hydrant is a better choice than Trump. If you can’t get there with Biden then the problem is in your mirror when you look into it.
"Lean NOT on ur Own Understanding" WE have hopes/fears BUT don't LEAN on them,be open to GOD'S plan.MANY arrests/executions done, high-ups cloned to keep us calm, O, BigMike, Clintons, Biden r dead.
Yep. Trump is obviously bad. I focus on Biden and his failed ideology because people seem to think he’s good.
I currently have him down 11 in Michigan, 8 in Wisconsin, and 7 in Pennsylvania, with Ohio being a toss-up, but Biden leading by less than 1.
And that declining shared prosperity is the result of policies advanced by both parties, and some even specifically by Biden like denying people the ability to discharge student debt through bankruptcy while allowing corporations to liquidate earned pension benefits.
That doesn't mean you gotta vote for Biden tho. I'm voting green as it stands right now.
You better believe I will be at the polls to vote for Joe Biden and to end the rise of American fascism. #WeWillVote
No you fool, Biden will not send troops and ratchet up the tensions, he will defuse it.
You obviously have no idea, Obama is campaigning for Biden because Biden is incapable of doing it and Obama knows he is that’s why he was 1 of the last to endorse Joe because he was hoping it was someone else
Oh..I thought Biden is chasing him as the VP candidate. 2 late John Lewis (No pun intended)
Obama and biden floating cutting social security multiple times during his 8 yrs and when Bernie floated primaring him liberals freaked out and called him racist. Y'all were content when the well spoken blk man even as ppl suffered simply bc he wasnt a Republican
Any1 going into the primary should've know Bernie &amp; Biden were the top ppl 2 beat. Every1 ganged up on Bernie but he weathered them. Only a few went after Biden but since they all have the same policies it didnt really matter who won, so long as it wasnt Bernie, tulsi, or yang
I'm not voting for Biden, I'm voting for the people he surrounds himself with. Also, voting to get rid of the monsters currently occupying the space.
how if he needs votes just as bad as biden?
No more than people who believe Biden will survive his 4 years. You're voting for his VP
Hmm This question prompts me to want to order a Biden ball cap, to put on before I go over and be a decent person and help them.
Glad to see Joe Biden back on the campaign trail
If you write her name in your giving your vote to trump! Vote for Biden
The suburbs are depending on it.
HE HAD 10 TIMES AS MANY TURN OUT THAN FOR ANY BIDEN EVENT THIS YEAR!!!
It was still great when he blasted biden for forgetting his own words during the debate
I’m not one to pile on, but you were all so quick to jump up and down about Biden saying exactly what Trump would attempt to do.   Now that Trump says it, you are too scared to even name him.
I detest him more every day, every tweet.  Every time DJT lies in another tweet, Biden gets more campaign donations.
Bexley has always been pretty liberal. Especially us smaller home owners in south Bexley.  But it seems even more so this year, which is wonderful. If I had to count, so far I’ve seen probably 200+ Biden and only 3 Trump. 💥
Hows it feel to know youre candidate endorsed Joe Biden?
Top Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, reject Donald Trump’s suggestion to delay the election
Change also doesn't happen with complacency, arguable dems were and have been complacent since obama took office. Many only care now bc trump makes them care and pay attention. The so called "brunch democrats" just want Biden to win so they can go back to not paying attention
What a brave man to not mention anyone by name, nor to indicate that he was completely wrong for lumping in Biden's comments.
Just had the super fun thought that Biden could put up Hillary as his VP since we've all been living in 2016 for four years.
I don't support Biden
Opinion | Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
Man, this article really came back to bite you in the ass huh?
Trump supporters and Republicans have disdain for working class Americans. What planet is she broadcasting from? Could someone point out to the moron most Trump supporters and Republicans are working class Americans. She's as demented as Biden.
Hey Frank, going to double down on Trump testing the waters on doing exactly what you criticized Joe Biden for saying Trump would do?  Or are you always counting on a misinformed public?
I am in Ohio and no one I know likes Trump. That said none of them believe Biden will represent the average person either. That’s the problem I notice, problem is, they aren’t wrong.
DeWine and Biden are running a close race with dementia. He will change it to something else tomorrow. Maybe only if taken with vaccine🙄
Go listen to the audio. It exists. Biden also has dementia or at least early on set if you listen to him talk.
If I were you, I’d dump Trump and announce your support for Biden. Now, that would be the right thing to do. 🇺🇸
Go ahead, elect Biden, there won't be any AMERICA left!!!
Oh, I was aware. We weren’t talking about that though.
The question is if Joe Biden provides a thick enough lifeboat to keep us out of the acid long enough for this country to move in a different direction.
Okay, that's it  should be the Biden's VP. That prayer...Lord Jesus😭
Yes, my Dem friends are telling each other to “just hold your nose and vote for Biden”
Other terrible, unnuanced takes like that. I can count on my fingers how many friends and acquaintances in my age group are 1) voting at all, 2) actually voting for Biden, not a third party no-hoper when we live in a right-leaning swing state. I hope I'm wrong.
I wasn't accusing you. I lived and worked on a huge college campus from 2016-2019. I'm telling you what I see and hear. Warren/Kamala/Buttigieg supporters aren't going "well, Biden is 1,000% more progressive than Trump... but he isn't preaching M4A so he wants poor ppl to die" &amp;
So for all of you that thought Biden was reaching, how's it going this morning?
If and I think it’s a slim IF... but if Biden ends up president I’m taking all of my money out of the stock market ASAP. This is not financial advise. Lol

You think Biden has dementia?  Do you really listen to Trump?
It is so important to go out and vote for Biden so he will protect our troops from Putin's bounty hunters!!!
2020 election: Biden launches Ohio ad campaigns as Buckeye State suddenly in play
Cute, but study history- fascism has ever been defeated at the ballot box. Human rights violations have never been halted by voting. It’s only been by large movements taking the streets or by violence. *Also- Biden wants to prosecute “anarchists” in the streets
Biden bad
Don't forget the soaring homicide rate that is all under Donald Trump's watch. Not Biden's. Not Obama's. Trump's. It is the #TrumpCrimeWave I predicted in 2017 coming to fruition.
Oops. Biden right again.
Media people prognosticating about Biden’s vp pick should be finding out what Mitch McConnell will do when the president declares the election a fraud and refuses to step down.
Colin Powell announces he'll vote for Biden, saying Trump "lies all the time" - CBS News
So very true. Trump hates (learned that from his father) whereas Biden loves. Biden learned that from his Christian upbringing and his continued Christian values. Love always wins. Hate goes into the fire and dies. #SuburbsForBiden #SuburbanitesAgainstTrump
Well, now the Dems will blame Trump’s because we don’t have enough supply of safety goggles!  Biden will lie and say he would have had done that from the start?!
Trump wants to delay elections but send all of your kids into the trenches in the war against #COVID19.   Who does he care more about, himself or your kids? Who does Joe Biden care more about, himself or your kids? We know the answer to both of those questions. #Election2020
Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report

ICYMI: listen to my interview today w/  on  where we chatted US politics-notice Pat never asked me about Bill Barr hearing where he decimated Democrats or Joe Biden ducking unscripted interviews or Left's failure to denounce violence
The funniest part about accusing Biden of being a Marxist is that Biden has done so much to destroy poor peoples financial possibilities, aside from the crime bill, by making it even more difficult to break poverty cycles by stripping bankruptcy protections
Biden does warm the cockles of my heart..BUT..Trump &amp; his administration are BURNING the cockles of my heart. I can't cut off my nose to spite my face.... thx for the dialogue....😊
This says it ALL! Trump hates AMERICA; ESPECIALLY MINORITIES. Does not live up to Christian values like "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR". BIDEN LIVES UP TO HIS CHRISTIAN VALUES! #SuburbsForBiden
Perfect picture to send to #BunkerBabyTrump that Biden will save America from this nightmare that #BunkerBabyTrump has caused. #SuburbsForBiden #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
I initially wanted Biden to wait to pick a VP but now I think he needs to hurry cause Dems are going nuts &amp; starting to attack the process &amp; each other
trump will try anything to steal this election. via
Bet on it: Frank LaRose will make an election statement strongly condemning Biden &amp; then Trump.   He has done so almost every single time and many in local media keep giving him the platform to do it.

Hey Lurch. Hunter Biden didn't take money away from kids with cancer per a court of law.
Almost every1 in SC fell in line and vote for Biden when he said so
Trump pulling ads in Michigan is the counterpart to Biden doing a big ad buy in Ohio.
I see signs for Biden. The only sign I saw for Trump was taken down in March. There are also a TON of Biden-adjacent signs - vastly outweighing what I saw in the rural areas of Ohio.   We don’t fear our neighbors.  We Love our neighbors. #SuburbsForBiden
Reminder that other nations have not seen their economies contract like this. Donald Trump’s weak and ineffective leadership has destroyed the American economy. We need to build back better. We need to elect Joe Biden.
Everything you are saying is happening right now in Trumps America. Obamacare is more popular then ever even though it’s being sabotaged. Life was amazing under Biden can’t wait to get back those times. You people are denying actual facts..
The US deserves better than both of them. Biden has been there since 1972! He has Dementia. I voted Trump (Obama also), but here is the big secret: A lot of Trump supporters would vote for Tulsi.  No wars, although Trump hasn't started any either. They answer to the same donors.
NY Times: Obama (Privately) Slams Trump
Loyalty...I expect her to be loyal to the American people first and to DEFINITEY contradict and challenge Biden if he’s wrong or doesn’t do what’s in our interest. And if she’s eyeing the presidency. Good! That’s professional development.
Yes, I would help, as I wear my Biden mask.
Donald Trump Jr. really had a great interview on Fox News . If you listen he laid out what Joe Biden is all about. As a gun owner I refuse to surrender my guns to Joe Biden &amp; Bozo O'Rourke when they are saying "Hell yea we are coming to take your AR15". Joe has went way left.
Ohio is a swing state.  will win here if this investment continues. Look at the polling - Trump has spent $9m so far, and he’s at best tied. Biden spend $0. As Biden TV starts competes with Trump’s, Trump is toast.   Ohioans continue to suffer from Trump’s incompetence.

They could still have Hillary if Biden picks her and steps down after the election
the patriarchy is entrenched.... "Biden allies".... the horrors of a woman being "too ambitious"
I am sure he does. Just getting rid of Trump won’t address why we have Trump. That means someone worse is likely to come along after Biden.
Democrats are good at wasting time &amp; money. Mueller witch hunt &amp; the impeachment hoax are just two examples. The bet is that Biden won't make it through a debate with Trump. We don't care about his V.P. pick we need this debate now to see if Biden can even make it? Trump's my bet
NY Times: Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Also, even if Biden would stop who’s to say he’ll win, or even if he does win that he’ll actually reach being in office? You can’t wait to vote out the secret police, you can’t just cross your fingers and wait for it to hopefully blow over.
Seriously what more does anybody have to see or hear? November 3rd is THE ONLY WAY to end this.. Joe Biden WILL CONTEST results **IF TRUMP STEALS ELECTION** when exit polls show a BIDEN LANDSLIDE EVENT. Either way, TRUMP loses.
OH-9 had Hillary win by 22, so I'm gonna say Biden wins 45. Obama '12 won by 37
I respect your commitment to trying to right our ship. My primary choice bowed out but I'm not taking my ball and going home either, I'm doing my part to try to stop the bleeding. We can push for more progressive policy/ideas still, Biden seems at least mildly receptive to swayin

I know, I'm not even concerned with a lame duck tRump. If Biden wins in Nov the rats will begin to scatter.  So without the rats doing his bidding tRump is limited on the level of corrupt activity.
Voting for Joe Biden is like betting on the Cleveland Browns to win the Super Bowl

so how is Biden gonna choose between Rice &amp; Power for SecState
I’m sure this same editorial board, who endorsed Clinton in 2016 and Biden for 2020, carries a lot of weight

Coupla things: 1) "She'll only focus on becoming president if she becomes VP" doesn't bother me much because it's not like there's a lot else to do in that job; 2) Doesn't Biden have any women in his inner circle? Because there sure are a lot of weird leaks of this ilk suddenly.
Maybe the DNC and biden should court my vote as vigorously as they court the moderate Republican.
Lol y'all telling on urselves. u accuse ryan of being a trump supporter when he was only posted things tht the Dem party has done 2 alienate progressives. I swear u all have literally become blue maga. Biden &amp; the DNC can do no wrong, even if it's out in the open u still deny it
Meant to say hidden gem, not a Biden gem. LOL
Biden wasn’t my choice, but there is no comparison  in the quality of these two men as human beings.  is the lowest of low life’s (pathological liar, racist, only cares about enriching himself) you can’t honestly say that about
So basically you’re saying what’s happening now under Trump’s watch will also happen on Biden’s watch?
Joe Biden is a human typo
And voting for biden is voting to normalize elder abuse.
A bizarre criticism, that Harris is ambitious. Of course she is, but I don't see why that should matter to Biden. He already IS president if Harris is VP, and might not even run for reelection.

Replace them with Biden signs!
I think Biden will forget to vote.
How do you hold a presidential debate safely during a pandemic? Cleveland will have to figure out before it hosts Joe Biden and Donald Trump in September.
THATS why it got outta control here? Not the fact that we've put businesses over lives? Not the fact we have masses of ignorant people who are still going out when they don't have to? Trump is a narcissistic idiot who hasn't helped one bit but it wouldn't be different with Biden
No Biden connection here. Pfizer is fast tracking some trials,Moderna has some good results. We're 6-8 months away from even the 1st widespread use. By then, the main question will be how badly the conspiracy theorists have tainted the vaccine.They screwed up mask usage.
AEW rules! Freshly SQUEEZED Orange Cassidy is truly a Biden gem!
Joe Biden has lost 2 primaries including the 2008 primary to Obama. Was he not focused on becoming president? Why is it okay for Biden to be ambitious but not Harris?   Asking for a Black woman who already knows the answer to this question.
I need someone who is good to do a meme of  with a ring through his nose and a chain being held by Nancy or Biden. Because all he is a stooge. He has no backbone and is almost as bad as Biden. He just gets led around and told what to say and what to do.
I bet they collectively orgasmed when they saw the politico post about Biden picking her for VP
LOL like Biden's thirsty ass wasn't sitting there the whole time role playing all the scenarios in which some crakkker took out BO.
's choice for VP is his, but listening to the  who fault any of his choices for having ambition is sexist. VP Biden had the same ambitions. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Pick the best candidate who will garner the most votes for the ticket
Biden has also done a lot of signalling he won't challenge major gop policies, so my money is on top accepting him to get rid of trump and making a stronger play in 2024 with someone more dangerous
FWIW I think Harris would be a thrilling addition to the ticket and would make a great VP. But I can say for damn sure that I’m going to support whomever Biden picks and not play games in the press about it 😡
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Went to the site and lmfaoooo it's Bernie/Warren folks that created it and they are roasting Biden but still asking for your support? Like... do you hear yourself when you speak?

Obama and Biden Fo sho
I don’t think they’ll go for someone as high-profile as Harris or Warren, and right now I’m betting on Susan Rice or Keisha Lance Bottoms, but Tammy Duckworth I also think is a solid pick. That said I don’t know what Biden’s actual strategy is so I really have no idea.
And that's why I'll be voting for Biden. We need a real leader!
I feel you, and I tend to sway back and forth between that stance and the one in my first tweet. I'm just at the point where I really don't think that a Biden presidency will save those lives. he and the DNC have shown that they're much more willing to compromise with the GOP...
Lol y'all lost the independents when you backed Biden.
The only reason Biden didn’t run in ‘16 was because of his son.
Kamala is sponsoring legislation left and right, fundraising and boosting Biden like nobody's business, but refuses to make old white mediocrities more comfortable by apologizing for her excellence and ambition.

Sleepy Joe Biden is about as right leaning of a Democrat you’re gonna find. It’s why the DNC pushed for him over Bernie &amp; Warren.   Now Woke Joe Biden...that’s the guy you should really be afraid of, Sleepy? Nah, not so much.
My rebuttal for when Republicans start picking apart Biden’s running mate will be..Sarah Palin... and that about does it for that argument.
Another Trump failure. An awful move that should have never come to fruition. We are in such a bad place now. Don't expect immediate results with Biden besides being able to sleep better at night. He has a lot of work to do to clean up this mess left by Trump. #VoteTrumpOut

Well that sure isnt Biden...that man has just as many corporate backers as trump. The only difference is he's nicer
Louie Gomert, the gift that keeps on giving to Biden’s campaign
On the last one she can settle for Biden because she is rich and will be secure until she dies and her kids will have a nice inheritance too boot, probably their kids too...the rest of us are spiraling toward a life of peasant poverty.
Translation: All Republicans that have morals will vote for Biden
Bruh we know for certain now the primaries are just a money-making entertainment show. Debates were like 60% everybody on stage saying which version of M4A or m4a(lite) they wanted to enact. Every candidate said legalize marijuana.   And they give us Biden, No M4A, No legal420.
It was never about Biden, it was all about beating bernie. To the DNC it was all fun and games until he started surging in the polls and won 3 states. Then they had to close ranks and snuff him out
Completely baseless speculation but I don't think Kamala is gonna be Biden's running mate tbh
MAYBE - if Biden can nut up and pushes any type of worthy legislation. 😭

We are literally only days or a few weeks away from Joe Biden’s team campaigning him as “Weekend at Bernies.” So incredibly sad and no one on the left seems to care about his health. Get this man some help and stop the abuse.
"Biden Accidentally Reveals Handwritten Notes on Potential Running Mate Kamala Harris" -
Joe Biden shows empathetic leadership. He truly cares about each and every one of us. That is why I will be voting for Joe!
Of course it's a lie. This move will take months &amp; billions to execute. Reversing this Putin kiss will be part of Biden's reset with NATO allies in January. They're waiting for Nov 3rd to see if we're going to become a full-blown Russian ally.
Yeah, I definitely don't see Biden as a unifier.
Seems unlikely that Biden had nothing to do with any of Team Obama’s alleged dirty tricks.
No. It will be a lull but the nightmare is still running, the Trump part was scary, but the Biden part will do as much harm with less drama.
It is more offensive to point out the empty gestures of politicians like Joe Biden and point out their proposals are just a continuation that have led us into this chaotic failing state environment.
Lol, chances are Biden’s handlers are just really indecisive and are floating Harris to the general public with an ‘oopsie’. Poor guy.
Not Joe Biden.
I hope it means that he thinks Booker is going to be HUD Sec’y for Biden because otherwise his Klan card is waiting down at Headquarters.
Ha!  I think it was a pre-written obit and Biden’s “notes” a deliberate mislead.
Lmao Trump’s the one who wanted 5 debates. You better hope Biden cancels them
That’s Bullshit. Biden wouldn’t get the drug name correct. He’s having trouble completing a sentence, and he doesn’t even know where he is most of the time. When he’s in his own basement he needs to ask for directions.
Undoing Trump's policies isn't enough to start? There is no third choice. It's Biden or Trump. I don't think we can survive another year of Trump, nevermind 4 years!
Anyone who doesn't understand that EVERYTHING bad happening in 2020 is about getting Biden elected is either  naive or stupid #WednesdayWisdom #NotCoincidences #ElectionYear #Duh #FoxNews #FoxAndFriends #DemImpeachmentContinues #KatiePavlich
You can't fix the house until you put the fire out. If you don't put the fire out, there will be no house left to fix. Not voting for Joe Biden is an endorsement of the fire.
I get why people don't like Joe Biden. I get it, I do. But he does actually care. He will not invite himself to throw out a first pitch because the head of the NIH was invited to.
GO TRUMP. Biden and his socialist WILL destroy our great country. AOC, Omar, Schumer, Schiff and the old bitch Pelosi hate Trump so much they will destroy America. God Bless America. Vote Trump.
If you've got a problem, Joe Biden has a plan. Here are 100 reasons to vote for Joe:
Liberals blame Trump for everything. If Biden gets in, they will be begging for Trump. He has done so much for our country, but the liberals hate him. Biden will only win if the democrats cheat. If he wins his socialist partners will destroy America. GO TRUMP.
He's still more competent than Biden. He actually knows who he is and where he is. And he doesn't have that elderly man shuffle.    All that being said, this is an election that a third party candidate could easily win. Kill the two party system and vote third way.
Biden can sleep through his entire presidency and he'd still be a million times better than you.  The families of the soldiers murdered from Russian bounties say hello.
The DNC hasn't made Biden the official nominee yet. It's not a done deal. They will likely choose someone else after the last few Biden appearances.  Maybe not though. It's not for sure until they actually say it though.
If Biden picks Harris, who will Newsome appoint to her seat?
Fake polls. Debate poll  Trump 90% Biden.  10%
Russia bounties: Biden blasts Trump over Putin call and Afghanistan
I am unbelievably progressive and wish to everything holy that we had another option than joe biden but until 2024 we do not. Vote for him now so that a true progressive has the CHANCE to become president in 2024. AOC will be 35 in 2024. We cannot survive 4 more years of trump.
Say what you wan about Joe Biden but least the guy can walk down a ramp, drink a glass of water, recite 4 words without bragging about it, and not kill 150,000 Americans 🤷‍♂️

For the people who refuse to vote for joe biden and allow trump to get re elected i do not want to see a tweet about how upset you are when abortion becomes illegal and gay marriage is state to state and a 500 billion dollar wall is built on the border. That’s just the surface.

I can think of a State with downballot opportunities like two state Supreme Court seats that can net a President Biden a few more House seats in his first term
I’d like to beat the living shit out of Joe Biden, but...
Weird because isn't this "crime surge" currently happening now, as in now, while Trump is POTUS, not Biden, and has been for 3.5 years? Almost like he is projecting or something..
Pres. Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden’s America might look like, asserting crime and chaos would ravage communities.
NOT JUST A PREDICTION: CONCENSUS SAYS YOU LOOSE BIDEN.
Columbus and central Ohio is inundated with Biden signs. Nothing for Cheeto.

TRANSLATION-Make everyone equally miserable and poor. Democrats are for the poor TO STAY POOR. Republicans are for the rich THAT EVERYONE COULD BE RICH. That is a fact. I would whether be with the party that wants me to be rich, and not rich off my poverty as Biden is.
It is not about Voting Rights. It is about allowing foreigners to vote; so, you can cheat Biden. You will cheat with dead republican votes and all those stolen identities. This is how democrats lie. Make something it is not.
Our Crisis in the United States is made by the Democrats to make things worse than they are. Trump had our economy thriving and the democrats caused all of the problems from the virus to the riots to hurt our nation to hurt Trump's ability to get reelected president. Biden loses.
People of any skin color; can only succeed; when, we're allowed to pursue from our abilities as individuals free to seek a life without dependency on Biden or the weak democrat party. We must 1st see ourselves outside of our skin color and other differences that will only hurt us
Biden landslide victory! Voters show up in record numbers in support of  Trump is officially a one-term President! Just predicting some of the headlines we’ll see the day after Election Day. 😊 #Biden2020 #TeamJoe #97days
Surest sign that she’s in a tighter race than has been generally acknowledged.
I don’t know about y’all but I can’t wait to see Trump and Biden debate.. that’s some good content right there.
No more Sleepy Joe, should be "Crooked Joe Biden"
Out of curiosity, what do you think marxism is? And what are tangible examples of joe Biden giving in to people further to the left?
File this story under "things that keep me up at night."
If you're ridin' with Biden you ride off a cliff. Tell me I'm wrong.
What happened? 🤔(Also , I mentioned this before, Biden is basically a George HW Bush Republican)
I love Kamala Harris but she doesn’t help Biden with Electoral Map!  I would enjoy watching her wipe the floor with Pence in VP Debate.
biden gets more assistance than stevie wonder
All of that is on account of policy changes that have devalued labor and further privileged capital. We can change that, but not by continuing to follow people like Joe Biden who have led us to this catastrophic state
This is why we must vote in November.. you may not like Biden but damn it he’s the only option that will put an end to this honestly.
I know Joe Biden Mackey the work it would take, but it don’t make him right. No one, not one person is saying to stop offering any healthcare while we figure this out.
I put the fear of god in my wife with this week’s newsletter, and now she’s fired up to volunteer for Biden. Take a read and pass along to anyone else you think might want to subscribe.
Honestly please tell this to the leftist because they think joe Biden is the antichrist 😂
Funny how democrats claim Trump is divisive while using language that makes people more divided against Trump. What deception this is; if any think Trump is divisive, and do not see how Biden, Schumer, and Pelosi are divisive with their foaming hatred against Trump.
Sorry you don’t like facts. Economist has literally never had less than Biden +8 even when the aggregate was Biden +3
Biden being America’s best hope is a microcosm of 2020

Joe Biden offers no solution for controlling the pandemic, he only has criticism of Trump. Controlling the pandemic is impossible but as President Trump is doing it is being handled. We have not learned how to control the flu but we can handle it. Both can be managed.

NY Times: The Latest on Biden’s V.P. Timeline
You are closer to being a socialist than Joe Biden ever will be. Remember putting your hands in private businesses and giving money to farmers instead of allowing them to export their crops?
Well is he going to make America great again or not? Snap his fingers or sign an executive order but just do SOMETHING besides “daddy is trying his best don’t be mean to him 🥺” isn’t cutting it. If he’s not going to sorry man I’m voting for Biden.
They buried the lede. Russia is using InfoRos_ru, Infobrics_org and OneWorld_press to spread disinformation about COVID, Biden and “Blue States” leading up to November’s election. They have not and will not stop interfering.

But wait, Trump is airing commercials (in Columbus) saying Biden should not be voted for because crime will happen on Biden’s watch.  So which is it, is the president responsible or not? #GiveMeConsistencyPlease

I hate Trump, but I'm not too pleased with Biden right now. However, I know he'll do at least 1,000 times better than Trump.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...let's put out the burning house fire before we start bitching at each other abt how to usher in perfection next week. This November, if you aren't voting for Biden, you're voting for the fascist Trump. It's that simple.
I’d prefer it was a spirit journey, wake up and realize it never happened at all. But I haven’t done drugs that good in a very long time. It’s happening and I’m still not voting for Biden.
Don’t believe that for a second - did they just poll folks from Houston and Austin? Biden winning Texas is almost as crazy as Trump willing CA.
You are a raging stupid fucking annoying idiot if you aren’t voting for Biden.   That goes double for leftist who “just don’t like Biden” or “Biden has to earn my vote” y’all are stupid af.   Not voting or Biden is voting for trump.
you think Trump started the conflict? I would argue that Biden would have won the election, without the ideology political blitzkrieg we have witnessed the past 2 months. They want to marginalize the repubs. as racists threats, to destroy the party for good. A one party Govt.
Biden and the dem establishment want to:  Crush Medicare For All during a Pandemic  Add a $775B website for childcare search (google is hard) Keep Marijuana Illegal  Keep Weed offenders in jail, as legally owned slaves  Increase funding to Police for Consultants/seminars   ffs...
I have no words.
I want to tell you. I love  , Joe Biden. Good Man. A kind man. Thankful for him.

‘Do not hold grudges’ against Kamala Harris: Biden speech notes caught on camera
She wouldn't be the powerhouse she is if she didn't talk about it there. I don't care what was said or done, if BIDEN doesn't care....why do you? He would look hypocritical if he soured over that knowing good and well in 2007 he went after Obama and he was still VP.
Bro biden would be a Tories over in England. Bernie is considered a centrist in most of europe... as I said the everyon window is pushed to the right in this country
I’ve finally accepted my gambling problem when I threw money on Joe Biden’s VP candidate.
look it’s like a younger biden
Yea Biden seemed really worried in oct.  he any everyone else said he over reacted and was called racist for doing what he did.  Now of course it was not fast enough.  Face it nothing he does will change your mind you hate him that’s it
At this point do we see anyone other than Harris as VP? I know he probably wants Rice but I cannot see her leading the ticket in 2024 (should Biden step down).
I’ve never heard a D say a single thing about why Biden should be POTUS. Their only argument is he isn’t Trump. So sad that’s the best in their party. MAGA 2020!
If Kampala is really going to be Biden’s VP choice, that’s a huge mess. Good luck with that.
laughing my ass off at the yearly anarchists are accelerationist for not voting discourse after that biden quote. "you must hate x oppressed person for not voting for the guy wanting to prosecute you"
In 09 there were 12,469 deaths from the swine flu. There are 3,382 deaths from the coronavirus. *Joe Biden was Vice President in 09*
I’ve not heard a single democrat say anything to support they believe is competent to be POTUS.  The only argument I’ve ever heard is that he isn’t Trump. So sad. I almost feel sorry for Biden and his “followers”.
Stop it.  Vote.  Donate to Biden.  Get a yard sign.  Don’t stop till Nov 3
Man. I defended Biden on a FB post from a liberal friend of mine who was talking about how Biden would lose - I defended Joe by describing his base &amp; the disdain for Trump.  The dude deleted my comment.  Wow. Like ... Jesus.
I’ve never heard a Democrat give one reason Biden should be POTUS other than he is not Trump. I’ve also never heard a Democrat say that Biden is mentally competent. Is that the best your party can do?
I’ve never heard a Democrat say that Biden is qualified to be POTUS. The only argument for Biden I’ve heard is that he isn’t Trump. That is sad.
The fight against fascism will not be over even if Biden wins the White House
"Biden orally committed last week to steering funds away from police. An interviewer asked the former vice president: “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?”  “Yes, absolutely,” Biden said." NY Post
Can’t wait till we (Biden) tears it down!
.  Hi from Ohio. Trump is running ads here falsely claiming Joe Biden wants to defund the police and graphically portraying an ederly woman getting a defunded 911 voicemail before being violently accosted by an intruder. Biden isn't responding? Why not?
The hostage takers are the people that engineered The Biden nomination.
Trump bad. We don’t need the news to tell us that.  Who made trump possible? Who expanded our police, military and carcereal state? It wasn’t Trump. It was people like Joe Biden.
Why in the Trump ad does he use video of rioting that occurred on his watch and say this will be Biden's America?  Did I miss something?   I guess "Nobody likes me"
Also you don’t even follow me but you somehow found and decided to quote my tweet... just a creepy antagonistic Biden bro lol
You are right, the gestapo tactics of trump admin are alarming. But I firmly don’t believe that dem establishment is the answer. I hope Biden wins in November, but he’ll have to do it without my support, not that my support is nearly as meaningful as his billionaire donors lol
Anyone want to bet Biden was reading this off note cards
Politico “accidentally” dropped this Biden VP template naming Harris.  The only shocking news will be if it isn’t her.
I do hope Biden wins, but I’m not voting for or supporting him and I’m not about to start blowing the guy on twitter
Are you calling Biden a white Bill Cosby?
"Often an eternity," but things might not change at all. Aside from the obvious way it's different from all other campaign years, this race reminds me a lot of 1996, where Clinton's lead over Dole was essentially stable the entire time. Biden has been ahead of Trump all along.
And there are actually negative comments about what Biden’s America would be like?? I’ll take the possibilities with  over the reality of Trump’s America any day.
Was having an okay day and now I’m thinking about how elizabeth warren didn’t drop out before super tuesday screwing bernie sanders and leaving us with joe biden and donald trump as our two options this election
My nieces and nephews attend private school. Tuition is about 18,000 a year. We have some minority kids on assistance. They are thriving. Biden wants to take away their assistance.
Joe Biden plans to name vice presidential running mate next week
How will he do that? Right now there’s a million kids waiting for a school voucher to attend a better school. Biden ( and the Democrats) want to eliminate the program. What he’s talking about here won’t help a single kid stuck in a failing school. It’s sickening.
I think we’re going to see a lot of “jokes” from Biden in the next few months 🤷‍♂️
Would you rather them do nothing? You do know Joe Biden says he would have local police handle the situation? Does that not prove that local Dem. Governments are the ones who are politicizing the situation?
Dispatch: Joe Biden plans to name vice presidential running mate next week
Im glad Biden views anarchists as a threat
Would love to be a fly on the wall as  and  sit in the Senate realizing how badly they fucked up this primary. If they'd come together strongly, united against Biden hard, there is good chance we'd be looking at a very different scenario.
Joe Biden’s Press Sec: 32,000 followers Donald Trump’s Press Sec: 5,200,000 followers
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the Clinton/Obama machine and corruption
if you “begrudgingly” vote for Biden, I BETTER see you out protesting his administration just as hard as we’ve protested Trump’s. y’all better not relax.
pro biden ml is now my bit
guys, come on, this is just Biden recognizing makhno as an enemy of the revolution, right folks, right?
Primary exit polls suggest the black community is not Biden's problem.
I really love how liberals say that not voting for Biden is like voting for Trump, yet Biden and Co. seem to be doing everything in their power to alienate the left.
That’s the same talk that got Trump into the WH in the first place. Get Biden in and THEN work on the agenda.
Ummm apparently Politico may have let slip Biden’s VP nominee...? Image is from an archived version of the original Politico article, both linked here: Archive:  / Original:
I’m not a violent person but it would take all of my willpower not to slap these idiots. 70 million people died because of the war Nazi Germany started. 20-25m were civilians. How DARE they? (also, that makes no sense. Biden is a Democrat. Fascism is considered far right wing)
Haha well first of all I would consolidate media even more than it is; then I would start putting out polls that trump and biden were super super close in swing states to motivate competitive turnout for democrats (who are more numerous). That would work better for the deep state
If all of their money, brain power, and plotting resorted in them skewing polls in favor of Biden, they would be shooting themselves in the foot though. So the intention + likely effect just don’t line up at all and it just doesn’t seem plausible to me
Hidden Biden, that's a smart choice? We need a leader!
Just a reminder that Joe Biden authored and campaigned on the legislation written into law in 1996 that enforced drug crime sentences and thought Many black people were irredeemable, many of which are still serving time today.
Are you planning on staying on Twitter when Biden wins?
In response to being called "sleepy Joe," Biden should refer to 45 as Uncle Donald. #dumpuncledonald
Hey Joe Biden are you Hiding to Avoid Debating our President? What a Chicken!
When Biden wins and "nothing fundamentally changes," we'll still be fighting for dignity and equality.
Joe Biden doesn't fucking matter, the Democratic Party doesn't fucking matter. The people matter. And we are being let down, abandoned, and screwed, by the party that purports to be "for the people" in the name of fucking profits.
If every major media outlet collaborated to make it seem Biden had an insurmountable lead, democratic voters may not feel as compelled that they are needed to go out and vote. So creating that narrative that Biden is “up big” would only hurt dems, and it doesn’t make sense.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump will meet for their first debate in Cleveland in September, but whether there is a live audience will depend on how the pandemic is going.
Plans. Actual plans.
“Joe Biden is technically the most progressive candidate ever.”
Lmao Joe Biden literally got Botox
Do you think that every single news outlet and scholarly poll institution is systematically skewing their polls to make things look worse for trump? Come on man that’s silly. How would that even benefit Biden? If anything it’d make people feel safer staying at home. Makes no sens
You’re right Pepe, I care more about the economy/virus/racial issues in this country than Biden slipping up words! Maybe my priorities are in the wrong place but polling on issues and presidential preference shows otherwise 🤷‍♂️
Biden is doing a fundraiser with Warren Friday night. Could that also be announcement time?
back to Hiden Biden.
Funny how even Biden supporters won’t even try to argue that Biden is mentally competent. Their only argument for Biden is they hate Trump more. 🤷🏻‍♂️
New poll: President Trump holds slim lead over Joe Biden in Ohio
They ""aired all the dirty laundry"" though.  CNN cut away when Joe Biden started. it Was REFRESHING to watch. He's got good people.. No deception/division/racism... like the OLD🇺🇸AMERICA🇺🇸 back + RACISM finally addressed!.
So other than cry, what do Democrats do if they get president Joe Biden, but only 49 seats in the Senate?

NY Times: Oil and Gas Groups See ‘Some Common Ground’ in Biden Energy Plan
That is not a productive route forward. Biden is articulating reforms and has the support of some advocates in the BLM community for his moderate reforms. I’ll take it! Definitely better than going schizophrenic pressing the “antifa” button every 2 seconds 😂
Who believes Biden got the questions ahead of time????😀
It's a hearing alright..we hear the dems...Attorney General Barr sits there listening..NOW..would I=NO...am I disgusted w/dems=YES  -now FOX is showing (what I am certain are prepared questions ) BIDEN..what a news day this is..lies, innuendo and more Biden bull..I pray it stops
Another ploy to split votes from Biden
Biden says, "he would use local police to handle the rioters."😂😂 Does he mean that democratic local governments wouldn't be doing this, if not for political purposes?
To be honest I don’t care if he slurred his entire sentence! Why is trump letting working people suffer in this economy? Why did he let the virus get this bad? Why is his response to calls for racial justice unmarked gestapo? Big difference in severity between Biden + trump lol
Now Biden is giving a "campaign speech." on National T.V. Perfectly aligned with the "Barr Blitzkrieg." Political Theatre.
Of corse M4A isn’t on the dem platform the person who won isn’t for it?   But Biden does want to:  1.) Make ACA subsidies more generous 2.) Make prescription drugs more affordable 3.) lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60   Among much much more.
People will die for the privilege of voting for Joe Biden lmao
"coincidence" That Biden has a press speech that coincides with the Barr Interrogation? Hmmm..... Political theatre. The Democrats don't need campaign rallies, they're handed campaigns through the use of propaganda media noise.
He sure did a terrible job of losing in OCTOBER by beating out literally the entire field except Biden and winning the first 3 states
Biden cant even be bothered to give lip service to M4A. He said he would veto it if it made it to his desk as pres. This means it passed both houses. He couldn't even say he would consider it
We're not because we nominated Biden

has spent approx $10m in Ohio so far, and  is just getting started here. Yet, on Trump’s best day, he’s tied or losing Ohio.   Ohio is a swing state, and Biden will win it. It’s made for him - urban, rural, African American, faith, blue collar, labor etc
I thought Obama’s mom was white. Or did he have a memory lapse like Biden.  Why put a picture up of a noncitizen?
What’s more, under Joe Biden I guarantee you the true protestors will not being causing violence because Biden will actually listen to their concerns. Trump is a sociopath and couldn’t care less about fair treatment and in fact wants violence.
Is that the reasoning for attacking Federal Buildings in Portland? the political talking points of the "left" are incredibly shallow.... What happens if Joe Biden wins, and the mob continue? Will attacks on mobs be deemed justified? Will they then be deemed Domestic terrorists?
because Bernie had already effectively lost. It wasnt a glowing endorsement. He more or less criticized Biden during his endorsement.
First, his sons actions are not his so that statement is irrelevant. Second, every politician is a rotten piece of shit. Like I do agree Trump is a racist, but if you think Biden isn’t you’re slaved by the media and the Democratic Party.
Kinda missing the part of Team Obama / Biden spying on Trump in 2016-17 and using known lies to damage Trump's campaign and then try to remove him from office.
None of this matters. If Biden overreaches ( raises taxes, gives Medicare to all illegals, as he promised, forces new zoning laws on communities, suburbia will punish him  in 2022.
Biden should hire Fauci right now and hold Covid updates on a regular basis...now!
Biden promised Medicare to all illegals. Does he stand by that?

ok i see why barr showed up... so to peddle BS on biden... this is all about putting out disinfo on biden...
It's not my fault Biden cant even be bothered to say he would consider M4A if it came to his desk. Democrats are constantly failing to meet the occasion during what is turning out to be the easiest presidential win ever. That's their problem not mine and I will call it out
Bc democrats have easy slam dunks they can be making but they refuse to. Who is hurt my legalizing marijuana? During this covid crisis when so many lost their healthcare bc of job lose and Biden cant even be bothered to say I would consider M4A given its popularity with the party
i can see why barr showed up to this hearing so the gop could peddle BS on biden...

“If you vote for Joe Biden you’re gonna be in Nazi Germany”. “We’re living under a socialist state”.  This is the politics version of Schrödinger’s cat but for stupid people.
Yeah - I think it’s what Biden has spoken of before.  It’s likely an improvement to what exists now
Funny how it’s never the candidate’s responsibility to get votes. Bernie and Nina can tell us all to vote Biden all day long, but unless Biden acts like he cares, it won’t work. If turnout from Bernie supporters is low for Biden, then THAT’S BIDENS FAULT. Terrible voter outreach
My prayer is in the form of positive acts toward others.  (And donations to the Biden campaign).  😂😂😂😂
There are no reasonable or convincing leftist arguments to make for not voting Biden
It’s not about republicans or democrsts, it’s a wuestion fot a sociopath heaing our country or Joe Biden, honestly Ohioans think about it!  Ism thinking if Mickey Mouse was a republican you would vote for him!
Who cares. She's a terrible representative along w the rest of the socialist squad bimbos. Biden shouldn't be using any of them or want their endorsements. Not even a Biden fan but man he's dumb for going for the cancelled culture morons
Biden sucks vote for Biden (I especially like that graph in the bottom right corner lol)
But I’m still voting for Biden because trump is crazy.
Wake up to reality. Democrats need power for any of these great things to happen. With the current brainwashed electoral college, even a blatant murder by cops, filmed on camera is weaponized against us. Think of Biden as the Trojan horse.
They fail to understand that 8 years of Obama/Biden LED to Trump. Even if Biden wins, which i have a lot of doubts he can, what makes anyone think it won't lead to an even more skilled reactionary demagogue innthe near future?
Because things will continue to fundamentally change for the worse otherwise? As they have been for the past 3-1/2 years? Joe Biden will not fundamentally change things for the worse. And will very likely change things for the better, "fundamentally" or not.
Biden up by 7+ in the 3 states that turned the Election for Trump in 2016 ( Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin ).
Wait...people really think Biden is going to win by a landslide...??
NEW: Biden has caught up with Trump in TV/radio ad spending in local markets -- Biden camp outspent the president's campaign over past seven days
Put up the Biden yard sign today. #Biden2020
The first thing Biden needs to do if we are able to dislodge the dictator is to change the passwords on the power grids.
I said Biden may handle the virus better, but the problems we face otherwise are caused by the belief system of people like Biden. His policy preferences these last 4 decades have rendered this nation into chaos.

Well, it’s out there. I’m throwing all of my support behind Joe Biden and going forward I only voting for candidates who represent my values.
Biden wins by 10+ pts....
Mr. Biden I hope your low visibility campaign does not bite you on the ass  You have to win Ohio and I am not seeing it. Hilary made the same mistake.
But in the end, he will publicly deny voting for Biden even if he did.  So...
The Heat Is ON: Biden Campaign Goes On Defense Over Senate Burisma Investigation
Health care may be the only shot biden has in winning. He has to make policy concessions or he will lose.
There is no universe where Biden is up 7 in Wisconsin and only up 3 in Minnesota
Biden, Obama, and Clinton are
Pointless to pick anyone from California which will likely vote   Biden anyway. Equally pointless to remove anyone from  Congress. More helpful to pick from the South.  Rice is excellent but too much baggage. Personally hope Abrams!
Trump will destroy Biden at the debates 😂 that’s if Joe remembers to show up 😂
Former Vice President Joe Biden is not mentally fit for the presidency, and he...
News flash Biden didn’t give money to stop an investigation, the us government along with about 20 other governments demanded the firing because he was corrupt and they wanted someone who wasn’t
DSA is not representative of your average voter. They are a small slice of the American electorate. (One I largely agree with btw!) But in the real world outside the Twitter bubble, Biden is polling the same as Hillary with younger voters and better with Bernie supporters.
Rice makes literally no sense what are you talking about?  No political experience and gives the right what they have desperately wanted, a way to hook all their Clinton conspiracy theories to Biden
We do have a major rapist in the WHitey House.  A vote for Biden would be a vote for the lesser of the rapists because ya know, Bernie was a gent who will never exist. I’ll vote for the lesser of the rapists who won’t support #M4A during a pandemic.  Thanks,  you suck.
You will not fix COVID because you don't care. Biden will.

I intend to by voting for Biden.
Funny you say that. Biden and Obama cages more kids and deported more illegals. #Fact
There are only two good choices for Biden: Harris or Duckworth. Anyone else is subpar, and I think a lot of people would be mad if it goes to neither of them.
Please MSM stop talking about trump and putin. They always talk. Stop taking the bait. Stay on Pandemic. Stay on Biden.   #JohnLewis #JohnLewisRIP
And the party is more united now than it has been in years. Over 90% of Bernie voters back Joe Biden. And Biden HS moves left on student debt, climate and foreign policy with Bernie and Warren’s guidance. The party is united around a very progressive agenda!

Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’
Verbatim. No exaggeration.   Me: “Do you remember you asked me if Trump matters?  5 yo dau: “I do  Me: “Well..Yes..Presidents..Bad decisions..People hurt..But still a human being.  Her: 😐  Me: 😐  Me: “Do you understand?  Her: “Yes. Vote for Joe Biden.  Me: 😳😁😆 😂Exaclty!!
Biden has a massive lead. That's why Dems won't put weed/M4A in the platform, because they assume they'll win and can retroactively say "see? The voters don't want those things!" It is the perfect time for them to reject hugely popular policy.
So much for Biden trying to atone for the crime bill
And what's sad? They will STILL vote for Biden around the 90% mark.
I get that some people make speaking errors. U do realize that Biden stutters? As a medical issue, not as a common error. Trump has mocked disabled people, made sex comments about his daughter, and uses insults to seem powerful.
None of us should be surprised about #TrumpleThinSkin after Biden’s amazing #CelebrationForChange event last night. If I was Trump I’d be SICK! 😕
So, name one thing Biden said that was unintelligent?
I just think to blame this on the DNC (which really only works to nominate and elect a president) is inaccurate and largely not viewing how the process actually works.  Democratic voters elected Joe Biden and his delegates. Not Tom Perez and the DNC
But there were a lot of concessions to the more progressive wing of the party recently. A top climate activist said Joe Biden embraced the Green New Deal in all but name.   Did Bernie’s wing get everything? No of course not. They lost. But they moved Biden and the party.
At least the rose garden will be prepped for the Biden family to enjoy
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Good luck getting Biden elected now.
In order to pass Medicare for All, the idea is going to have to become viable enough for a majority of Democratic primary voters to back a candidate that supports it.  That said, Joe Biden backs a public option, which is a huge step forward. This all didn’t happen in a vacuum.
There was a whole primary on this and Bernie lost. You know that Joe Biden wasn’t my first choice either but this is how electoral politics works.  These delegates are largely people who just decided to run for delegate. Not some all powerful cabal.
to clarify this is directed at privileged people yelling at anyone that they have to vote for biden under the guise of “protecting minorities.” i hear so much more noise from y’all rallying around a rapist than from anyone who’s actually oppressed. not shocking
That’s why I am voting for Biden on Nov. 3rd. You have utterly destroyed what was an imperfect, but pretty nice place to live. Praying you lose bigly.
If he is guilty, then he deserves everything he gets...this isn’t about left or right, as anyone and everyone involved deserves to be held accountable!!  But you posed a question to Biden, and your guy has been there and was awfully cozy with the two at the front and center!!
If Biden picks Kamala it will be hilarious given their background of locking Brothers up doing football numbers for non violent offenses. Yet they'll try to "we're better than big bad orange oompa loompa man" their way into the white house. No thanks
You are an absolute LIAR just like Biden.  President Trump implemented the travel ban IMMEDIATELY.  He offered some of the best scientists to China to help with the virus. I know you lied because Biden himself said Trump was Xenophobic and then said Trump was right to ban travel
You have my vote Susan Rice 😉👍👍👍  POLITICO: ‘It's absolutely serious’: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap.   via
Man.  I made a comment tonight about how Americans are tired of 45 and how I'm voting for Biden even if he doesn't have a press conference or speak a word until November.  45's people didn't like my comment.  My feelings are so hurt LOL
Biden will pardon them all.I continue to be on the same page with  when it comes to Biden's VP choice.
Good analogy. The analogy I've been thinking of is Biden is an empty vessel for leftists to fill with their radical policy wish list. Also, your son is really smart for 11, or any age for that matter.
Can't answer for all Sanders voters, but I will not be voting forr Biden.
Same feeling among Pakistani, Somalian, Yemeni families when Obama and Biden weren't put to death for war crimes.
Lol. Didnt address my point at all. Because you can't refute the facts, I guess. Biden has been working against poor people his whole career. Not one policy he has would benefit them.
The fact that 34 percent approve is startling.
Neither of us has ANY idea what these 3 could do with exception of Clinton. Why would this effect Hillary? She’s not Bill. No, I don’t think Clinton and Biden are “buddies”. And, if Trump couldn’t bury this, HRC couldn’t. Honesty, no issue. Bill is up to his neck. With Trump.
People are talking when Biden gets in office we'll have tribunals and shit to convict this administration and it won't happen. Biden will say some shit like "more than ever the county needs to heal and come together and put the past behind us"
Yeah, because they follow Joe Biden on twitter
Omg tan suit Biden at inauguration 🤣
More “likes” than Trump has ever gotten. Biden beats Trump at Twitter even.

It’s under 8 years of Obama that race relations have deteriorated. Biden also.
So, Trump floats an asinine &amp; Illegal idea and you would like us to believe that Biden and those who found it unacceptable are being “absurd” for responding to THE EXACT WORDS the POTUS spoke. Saying NOTHING is ABSURD!  Giving THIS POTUS the benefit of the doubt, dangerous.
That was a very devisive campaign speech. Thank God you're not pres anymore &amp; if you were any kind of friend to Biden you would tell him to give it up
Joe Biden is have a live stream press conference as you read this. Look how many people have joined him
Take the L.  You earned it.  Us liberals would crawl over broken COVID-coated glass shards to end this presidency (in the Constitutionally provided means of an election).  Delay?  DELAY?  Shit, if you think Biden’s going soft you’ve missed that you’ve gone right to porridge.

Yes, can’t wait to hear President Biden!!
Sir, you have my full respect.  Hope to see you campaign again and/or holding a leadership role in Biden's administration.
Operative question:  is an active surrogate for Biden in the fall?
So like, who we gonna vote for president in 4 years. Geez I sure hope Biden isn't still around to run again
It's not that we want her. It's that it's where the chips would fall if election day got pushed. There would be no where near enough Democrats to back her over biden, sanders, warren, etc

the alternative is the Biden train
It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
Wow, Joe Biden was President for 8 years? When did that happen? What has Mike Pence accomplished over the last 3 years?
Excellent point. It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
. doesn't seem to understand a lot of people who are voting for  don't actually like Biden, but we understand that Trump needs to be out of office.   Trust me, I would love  to be the Dem Nom, but here we are.
If I was a Biden advisor, there’s 4 names I would push as solid choices on both electoral and governing scales.   1.   2.   3.   4.    2 with significant strengths and risks: 1.   2.
She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40 percent. Val Demings Is on Biden’s V.P. List. Will Her Police Career Hurt or Help?
Biden is smart to move left. He's got to energize progressives, but I think he'd govern as a centrist.
If white people are the only racist, as the Mentally Ill (D) want you to believe) why don’t we have WET (White Entertainment Television) or a month deadicated to Joe Biden (real racist) or a college fund/colleges for only white people, tearing down statues of Martian Luther King?
Donated to Trump again.  Biden is starting to scare me policy wise.  He's going far left.  I support some type of government health care though.  Opposed to school choice.
Thanks,             LISTERS:
You guys know Biden was VP, right? &amp; trying to become President? Is he "too ambitious"? 🖕
My projection of the Prez map right now.  Biden and Dems can still fuck this up but so many paths to 270 for Dems, not too many for Trump

Look at the way MSM licks Biden’s ass &amp; all dems 4 that matter. Does anyone really believe if he became president they would hold him accountable 4 anything. Not only that but they would cover 4 everything. He will destroy this country &amp; the media will show pics of roses

Plus, word out of the WH has been that Biden or Harris were the candidates he was most concerned about. I think we need to give him a two-fer!
I hate to inform you on this one, but Biden hates socialism too.
Me too and a flag!! There’s like one joe Biden sign on my street. I want them to be out one day when I bike by so I can ask why they are voting for him. I’m really curious.
Again, this is already happening NOW under Trump. And as much as you want to believe 45's false claim, Biden does not support defunding the police. That has been addressed for like a month now.
It’s fake news that he said that bucko! But as a pans, matching Biden sausages in the oval would be good for America.
It's beyond me, really, that purity politics can be a thing right now. I don't understand why some would rather see Trump get a second term than have Biden who, while not as progressive as desired, would be far more so than Trump. It just doesn't seem pragmatic to me at all.
"Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle" -Biden

That's what they want right???????  No more police Biden

Vice President Biden, I really want you to win. You have to. Please choose objective people to run your campaign. I don’t mean to tell you what to do but I want you to win this election so badly that I implore you to be gracious when your staffers direct you. Thank you, sir.
Joe Biden goes all YOLO more than you might think.
My daughter is legit having nightmares about that Trump commercial where the old lady gets murdered by a burglar because Biden got rid of the police. This is my life lol. #parenting
Nope not one bit. I have a preference but I  can avidly support Biden no matter who he chooses.
Surreal. I agree more with Joe Biden's public position on covid19 vaccines than President Trump's, even though in reality Biden doesn't give a sh*t about vaccine safety. He's just trying to score political points as always.
Hid help us. Trump and Barr are planning to end our free elections and disavow any win by Biden if Democrats. America is foomed
I WAS a Warren Democrat and I'm voting for Biden. That was then. This is now.
Are those really SHEEP on the necktie that Sleepy Joe Biden was wearing during today’s speech?
Biden’s gotta clean this up. 1. The term “anarchist” is being used by Trump to demonize protestors. 2. There are people with legitimate anarchist political beliefs that have committed no crime.
you really are a piece of work. I was trying to watch reruns of BigBang Theory and I saw that lying scoundrel’s commercial 3 f*cking times! He lies about Biden and trying to scare the elderly. You literally have stooped to an all time low. 🙄
Translation.     still ahead in the polls in Ohio we need to administer more economic damage before the election to ensure Biden wins
First female president if Biden wins (and this futuristic post is true)
Trump knows he’s wrong for having that commercial with somebody breaking in that old lady’s home talking about “Joe Biden’s America will not be safe because he calls for defunding the police”. He didn’t even say that.
The fact the press Corp  clapped after Biden got softball questions just shows they are so disconnected from the ppl they are truly the Washington swamp elites and are #FakeNewsMediaClowns #EnemyOfThePeople we hate you &amp; don’t trust you AT ALL. HACKS &amp; RATS
RUSH: All of the news that Biden's got it in the bag, that Biden's up by 10, 12, 13, whatever it is, they aren't true, they never have been true.
has become everyone's angry boy/girlfriend - sending an email then sending a text asking if we saw the email. lol   Biden. Chill. All we want from you right now is to finally announce who your VP candidate is. Lordy.
So then why make the false claim about this being the entire country under Biden when it's happening right now under Trump?
If Joe Biden wins the election I am moving out of the country
Seeing a lot of Gleeks say Will would vote for Trump but he wasn’t openly bigoted, just extremely out of touch so he probably loved Biden from the start. He has a bit of a white savior complex, is posting about hating looting/“not all cops”, &amp; he denied allegations against Biden.
I admit, I was shocked to see Karen Bass' name as a VP candidate, but she has a lot of experience. I disagree w/ Sunny on VP picks. Most presidential nominees choose VPs that won't outshine them. McCain made that mistake w/ Palin. Pres. Obama didn't when he chose Biden. #TheView

Biden pays respects to John Lewis at Capitol

RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.

I think Soros is starting to develop dementia like Biden. "Trump will disappear in 2020 or even sooner."
Yeah I voted for bernie in the primaries but Biden’s moved left quite a bit since then. Definitely settling but he’ll still be so much better than what we’ve gotten the past 4 years
Biden does give off creepy grandpa vibes at times but I don’t think it really rises to pedophilia. But yeah that argument is immediately moot when their president wishes maxwell, child sex trafficker, “the best”

Thank goodness she didn’t have her underage granddaughter with her he would have turned into a Pervy old blood hound and this would have been a different video. Biden and trump are both creeps.
Charlamagne runs his mouth calling our president racist without offering up reasons as to how he’s racist. Why don’t you actually educate yourself in Biden’s past and all the racist shit he’s said and done. Trump has done more for minorities than Biden has in 50 yrs.

Virus gonna go away after the election like it has gone down in every other country, media just running with it for now. They will use anything they can against Trump lol. If you rather see Biden in the warehouse that's scary. Dude can barely even say what hes trying to say
Poll of who they think next president will be should acccompany it.   I bet the 20% who say NO also think Joe Biden wins the election.  Thus they think Joe Biden is going to implode the country in the next 8 years ?     This country will persevere
breh Imagine if this is the map with a blue AZ and blue FL (realistic if not likely) plus NC (realistic) plus if Texas and GA (possible) are legit in play then the Biden uber blowout is possible  I actually think MI WI shouldnt be blue quite yet maybe FL should though along w/AZ
take the lead now President Biden before he kills us all. I'm concerned about my grands and great grands
Some of the most interesting things to look at are the  Obama-Obama-Trump Counties in swing states.   I feel that turnout in predominantly blue districts will be better, but it's still important to  evaluate how Biden will perform v Trump in Swing states.
This is what we need to elect Joe Biden to STOP! #ByeDon2020 Take your illegal Gestapo with you!
George Will agrees.
Poll Question: “Do you support our hero Donald Trump or that stinky Joe Biden?”
This is me not being surprised that  would support Joe Biden when Biden and his son are in bed with the Chinese communists who keep the Uyghur slaves grinding out his $300 plus Nike shoes.
I know your revenue comes from ads, but Trump’s horrible &amp; fear mongering ad with the old lady about to be robbed in Biden’s America is just plain offensive and despicable.  I feel like I’ve seen it 100 times, enough, you are doing a disservice to elderly Ohioan’s!
We need a president who will put the health safety and piece of mind of our kids first unite the people restore our infrastructure FIX OUR ROADS open the minds of the ignorant and show world we can be respected and trusted as the greatest country in the world again BIDEN 2020! ✌
It’s Biden Time!  #Biden2020
Now do Biden!!!
Me too! Biden is smart and has coherent thoughts, unlike that man you support.
I don't want to presume what people think, but as a public librarian for 20 years I feel safe to say that most Americans don't really pay much attention to politics. They sense when things are wrong and think, "Obama..Biden. I'm voting for Biden!" That's it. That's how they vote.
It may be low priority at first, but Biden administration must look at regulating the social media companies. Otherwise this country will continue to be bat shit crazy while risking lives of millions around the world. Sorry Jack.
I guess it is expected by all that Biden choose a woman of color.By the help of Russia right? Hell no! #Biden
Go ahead, elect Biden, there won't be any AMERICA left!!!
If you're ridin' with Biden you ride off a cliff. Tell me I'm wrong.
It’s not about republicans or democrsts, it’s a wuestion fot a sociopath heaing our country or Joe Biden, honestly Ohioans think about it!  Ism thinking if Mickey Mouse was a republican you would vote for him!
What is wrong with you? You’re going to vote for someone just because you don’t like the Presidents personality? Biden will support a socialist agenda, has said he will raise taxes, and supports abortion until birth. He’s a pervert and can’t form a coherent sentence.
It is amazing the lengths the MSM will go to avoid really news. Especially when it involve wrongdoing by President Obama, Joe Biden and other Democrats. They spied of Trump and lied about it. The evidence is clear. Yet no peep from the MSM!
But what about Hunter Biden?!?!
Leslie, the world will roll on the ground laughing if America  is stupid enough to elect a senile old fool like Biden. Don’t get your hopes up too high,  as I fear your are destined to be sorely disappointed.
No conservative would vote for Biden . If they did they can’t be conservativeBiden's potential VP pick Katen Bess and Scientology...
What a prick. There are TWO Trump flags in my neighborhood. I give them dirty looks when I walk the dogs thankfully the Biden signs out number the flags by at least double.
HEY HEY HEY! my subaru is way cooler than joe biden. it has a sunroof and leather seats.  and it's not beholden to any corporate interest but the bank loan.

Right—eye on the prize. It probably didn’t help that just as I left work one of my fellow respiratory therapist saw my Biden button on the inside of my work bag &amp; said—oh God, he’ll ruin our country. trump has it straightened out! This is an educated respiratory therapist!!😩
At this point  campaign ads should just be dumb Biden stuff followed by this gif. 😂
So I have my Biden sign in the yard..right. I come home from work, walking back up the driveway from getting the mail and some guy screams SOCIALIST out of his car window at me. There you go—trump’s America.
Oh. 💡why I may have been blocked. I made a comment that the white liberal women who say Biden shouldn’t pick Harris, but should pick Warren, reminded me of the white liberal women who wouldn’t vote for Obama and said Michelle was phony because “what Black woman spoke like that.”
Biden bout to nominate Karen Bass as VP and Tom Cruise as speaker of the house. Scientology taking over
DEMOCRATS encourage people to riot? Who sent the storm troopers to escalate the carnage in Portland? Not Obama. And not Biden. Not Pelosi. Not Schiff. Not Nadler. Specifically, WHICH democrats told the protestors to riot? I know: "a lot of people are saying".
I’m with you! Vote for Biden!!
If they vote for Biden they’re not paying attention and DUMB.
Here’s your boy biden:
Unironically will not vote for Biden if this is his VP pick
Can I see those stats bc I just saw Biden worth 9 million ?
Dr. Alveda King:  The left will "grab at any opportunity" to twist an occasion like the funeral of #JohnLewis into "a political moment."  #Obama #Biden #filibuster
Trump can’t get out his own way. This election should have been in the bag for him. I’d be livid if he was my candidate. Also Biden doesn’t get a pass but Trump is just that horrible that folks would vote for a keg of beer rather than him.
Wouldn’t it be awesome if Biden announces President Obama as his VP pick?
I'm just a simple man with a simple question.  What did Biden know and when did he know it?  This is a trick question. Go.
Who is Biden?
Joy. I’m not sure where you’re going with encouraging negative noise around Biden but I’d be careful if I were you. This isn’t the year sweetie. Biden is doing just fine cut the crap. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Hahaha! “Goal post shift” Cool pivot. Must’ve learned it from Joe Biden. “Great to be here at this community center.” “Oh, that’s a joke. It’s look like the one I worked at 60 years ago”
No, we're talking about Joe Biden not trump and when he's voted out of office the indictment will follow. Thank you buh bye 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Biden’s a pedophile I guess you support that huh?
There's an enormous disconnect bordering on cognitive dissonance between one of the major primary progressive/left issue of $ in politics, Biden's corp connections, the Dem response to the pandemic exposed crises, Biden's platform and the prospective VP impact on policy.
A more apt comparison is with Bernie, who's older but very sharp and fit. (Sigh.) And Biden never was very sharp.
Even at the risk of inviting further scrutiny on the Biden family record when it comes to corruption
She's actually a really close as we're going to get progressive from California and Biden needs California  bad.They wanted Bernie Sanders both times and the neoliberal machine did everything to not let it happen.
Has to be Kamala, nothing against other contenders. Ready on day 1. Knowledgeable on both domestic and foreign issues. Effective campaigner. Proven. Inspiring. #KHive energy. Suppose Biden can't serve early in term - who do we want as Commander in Chief? #BidenHarris wins in Nov.
But John Roberts will swear in Biden on Jan 20th  And then the Military does what Joe says
Guess who I want VP Biden to choose for his VP? The other  candidates are great leaders and would be great VPs.. BUT Senator Harris checks all the boxes for me. Biden/Harris 2020! #BidenHarris2020 #changeagent #VoteBlue
Biden and Obama knew about Epstein and Clinton.  Sorry.  🤷🏼‍♂️worse then Trump. No contest.
Yea.  Again. Biden is a creepy kid toucher.  That takes precedence as morally unsound over trumps being recorded when he wasn’t aware.
Ahhh.  Got it now.  Geee thanks for helping me out.  Lol. What a 🤡 you are.  I got all day.  Keep deflecting from creepy puppet Biden.  Speaking of which.  He can use you on his panel considering his cognitive decline.  Oh.  Cognitive...I’ll dumb it down😘
Wait so white men are trying to dissuade Biden from picking a black woman in favor of... another black woman?
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I know it's just one poll, but people should be prepared for this thing to get tighter as the election gets closer. It's nothing against Biden, nor is it saying Trump is doing something well, but that's just how it always goes. Polls always tighten up as time ticks away.
if the liberal agenda is to elect biden and promptly follow with electing the reincarnation of john mccain, he’s right  somehow i suspect that’s not most liberals’ agenda
they may want biden elected but they certainly don’t want any real progressive policies to ever come into effect
My random points are things I fear about Biden. That’s all.  Communism.  The behavior from the rioters in Portland.. separate from the protestors.  The destruction of the nuclear family talk.  All of it.
In 2016 when Trump was running.  It caught my interest because he is different. I don’t agree w all he does but I said, maybe as a result of Trump a Phoenix will rise from the ashes and be what America needs.  I’m not really MAGA as much as scared of what’s attached to Biden
So funny story. I didn’t vote for Trump.  Done a lot of research and this is where I currently stand because Biden is a puppet. A racist and creepy with children. Funny you are so on board with him.

Rep. Clyburn  said Joe Biden  needs a VP with #passion , that's all you need to know. Kamala Harris has enough passion to share with all of us. I don't know how anyone can disagree with that statement. But of course you will always have #haters  #RidinWithBiden2020
No tests but deaths.when are you going to figure this out. This is pretty black and white.And mail in ballots and absentee are the same! Biden might have the beginning of dementia but he still is ten fold smarter than  Make America Honest Again and vote

Should Biden pick a black woman as his running mate is a question people are struggling with. Just to ask the question is insulting to black people as a whole. Black women are qualified and strong enough to lead, so we will see if Biden is brave enough to choose quality.
I can see it already being a problem. If a state can't call it on election night because there waiting to count mail in ballots &amp; comes down to that one state or maybe two states. No news station can call the Presidential election that night. 45 will explode. Biden must win big!!
And that is why we need a real leader, Trump is a liar and a Natiinal disgrace. We had 4 years of crazy don't need another 4.   Biden is the way to go, just look how he handled this pandemic....oh wait he didn't. He passed  it off  per usual. #NobodyLikesTrump
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots

Henry Olsen owe Joe Biden an apology,Trump did try to delay the election.
Donald Trump ... Joe Biden .. both complete losers along with the rest of that trash ... sorry if I dont pick a side but why the fuck would I ?  Give me better America ! .. you can argue "Your guy" all you want .. with someone else who gives a fuck ..

There is no way a 14 year old girl is emotionally equipped to handle a sexual relationship.
And he never tried in those 8years. Just like 99% of the shit Biden spews about doing neither he not Obama attempted to enact a single time. Biden only pushed racist legislation and said desegregation is going to make everywhere an “urban jungle”.  Nothing to see here.
Joe Biden support is just as toxic as Trump support. Only in a time like this white liberals can down talk great black leaders. Because y’all Biden Bros let that old white racist fool go on The Breakfast Club and talk shit so Bill Clinton took that same risk🤷🏾‍♂️
Do NOT believe Biden's Florida numbers
Biden would be wise to just abandon GA, OH, NC, and FL. He wont win them. Pour all your resources into WI, MI, PA, and AZ. Flood the airwaves, massive spending, and pick Klob as VP (but the campaign wont do that).

Doesn’t mean I will always stand here.  And if and when more comes out I have the ability to change my stance.  It’s called objectivity. Trump is guilty of a lot I’m sure.  But I don’t want puppet Biden and what’s attached to him.  That’s the driving force behind my stance. 🇺🇸
agreed, but the energy for Biden is what gives me hope (as opposed to 4 years ago)
Yes, but the effectiveness of the Dem response changes.  If it were Bernie, he'd go "Yes, and...?" and the DNC would scramble and look stupid claiming that wasn't what he meant.  Since it's Biden, they all just point and laugh.
That's what I thought when I first heard her mention it. But she called him Mr. Trump. Whoever she is she's a witness that was there.
Isn’t Biden both and useless? 40 years in office he’s done nothing
What about the women that spoke out about biden assaulting them? I guess it's only when phony allegations like ms Ford with Kavanagh?  What happened to believe all women?
Dude if your talking Obummer? He was selling us out to Iran &amp; China. Which Biden will continue. Nothing he did mattered to US. Least Trump is making America first in all the fields across the board. Go back under your rock &amp; read something besides CNN $ WaPo/Times
Might as well use the constitution one more time before China gets Biden in to make America made in China.
Not sure if keeping pedo Clinton secret and Biden also knowing along with Muellar qualifies as “pales in comparison”. But you go with that.
Let's not forget calling Biden a rapist. Doxxing a union rep and making death threats. Calling Hillary a corporate whore. And the list goes on and on. Now they're mad people are calling them on their shit.
Right! You think corruptions a part of that ideal? Maybe you should do a lil researching of that topic pertaining to Biden &amp; son to China, Ukraine, etc. &amp; that goes for MANY Dem leaders like Pelosi, Schiff, Romney, etc &amp; how they launder their money to hide thru LLCs &amp; fake co.s
It's always fun to show how Obama Biden took us out of the Bush recession and into the longest period of growth since after WWII.  And we entered recession this year before the virus hit
Fascism vs Fascism lite I'm afraid. Joe Biden is not committed to helping the oppressed.
The Obama-Biden administration took us out of a recession once. I think Biden can do it again. Plus, he won’t lie to us everyday and he’ll listen to qualified experts.
That’ll be where Biden would reside. Are you kidding? Biden can’t string a sentence together &amp; you know it. They’re hiding him in basement to spare embarrassment. Same w debates bc Trump would tear him up one side &amp; down the other like Swiss cheese. Poking holes in all his BS!
Punished for what? All the corrup is in the Democratic Party! Your kidding right? Voting for Biden is voting for Hillsry bc he’s just an empty suit &amp; head for that matter &amp; someone else be pulling his strings from behind. Already heard he’s bailing &amp; another stepping in here doin

You can have a Biden Presidency or keep rasing consumer spending  But you can't have both.  Sux  Then again, the market quarter reporting is over until October  It's too late to stop Trump's economic NASDAQ campaign
While both are wonderful, neither one is ready to be president day one, which is one of Biden’s prerequisites.
Yes it will be hard for Joe Biden to top ... [checks notes].. a 33% annualized decline in economic activity. The worst in U.S. history.
I guess there's an argument that the SALT cap pressures state governments to reduce spending, and removing it would remove that pressure...just seems like a dumb thing to bring up right now. Do it after Biden gets elected
(1) Being "able to" doesn't mean he "will" 😒 Biden is not left. He's definitely centrist and hasn't evolved his thinking over time. Did people suddenly forget about his recent interview where he told Black people they weren't Black if they didn't vote for
Check it out folks #JoeChina AKA  is more worried about none-Americans than he is our countries own citizens. Are we really going to let this man take over the oval office to enrich his son #HunterBiden even more? &amp; the rest of the #Biden family too.... #Trump2020

This is completely ignoring the fact that Biden is a pathological liar, a right-wing corporatist and who his donors are he will barely enact any of the things he promises. Also the middle ground approach doesn't work with the looming climate catastrophe.
I just want to say I do feel bad for those suffering from dementia. My Dad passed from Parkinson’s. It’s just that Joe Biden, Idk how to even describe it but his unapologetic ignorant, abrasive, arrogant attitude towards everything really I find off putting
There’s only one thinking stop a bounce back that’s Joe Biden getting elected this fall please remember to vote trump
Not too sure about Americans you never know they might just be dumb enough to elect Biden as president so he can go over there and give everything away again Democrats are for sale vote trump in November

Not too happy to be retweeting Eric Trump but I will be giving Biden the benefit of the doubt and say this was an honest mistake?! Reality is: I AM CONCERNED with Biden’s health and preparedness to be president.
It’s time for you and your brother to speak out and say you are voting for  Many people still respect you and your brother. Plus, we all know Barr would vote for Biden.
Wouldn't it be a cool idea to let Biden announce a running mate first? Just saying....
That’s your opinion. For people without health insurance, Obama did a lot. That doesn’t matter. We can have Trump who is casually racist, or Biden who is closet racist, but is at least listening to the far left. Don’t forget who BEGGED for those crime bills...it was us (blacks)🤷🏾‍♂️
Hillary was supposedly “up” the entire election cycle... I don’t buy Biden being up.

It was ok to attend this because it’s a rally for Joe Biden voters, much like the ones in Portland, Seattle, Chicago, DC, etc.
Folks, it STILL works! If you want to have a lil fun, go make yourself some Biden Memes Courtesy of the Biden Campaign. I JUST made this one for example. It’s easy!
Had Biden ever done anything that isn’t a disaster?  Not just within the last year, but at anytime?   His entire career has been a complete failure.

They're gonna go hard in Ohio 🥺 but I'm already seeing Biden signs in the same spots I was trying Trump ones in 2016 so I'm optimistic
I'm sorry but I have spoken with people having just come out of a literal coma who have had more lucidity than Joseph Biden has in his scripted, edited commercials

Trump just stopped low income housing from being developed in stable suburban communities. Biden sucks, he’s a terrible option, but he doesn’t empower racist. Trump does, Biden is the lesser evil.

Joe Biden can only pick 1 running mate. No matter who he picks, it's not going to be everybody's 1st choice. We can't turn on him if our choice isn't the one. Nothing is more important than getting the most racist, bigoted president of modern times out of the white house.
I think many leftists (myself included) would be surprised to learn we are being "embraced" by Biden lol
The Dems that questioned Barr were amazing asked him important questions that we as Americans want the answers to.  The Reps were a disgrace &amp; refused to try in any way to find out pertinent information that the voters want.  I’m conservative (voting for Biden) and feel this way!
This is awesome!  I thought I was going all Biden and my memory was messed up.  It did happen the way I remember it.  Tricky how they try to erase history.  Erasing it because a lot of evil and criminal stuff
Your brother was going to vote for Biden, you know.
Sad you think Biden isn’t racist, the whole democratic party was founded by racists. When did race even come up? You brought that shit it
And this is their Democratic pick ??👇Joe Biden declines invitation to sit for Fox News interview
That’s easy. Biden’s not a danger to our country. Trump’s taken our country in a dangerous direction &amp; it’s going to take a good long time and a lot of work by future presidents to undo the damage Trump has done to this country.  We need someone that will unite &amp;heal the country.
You taking about Biden? I’m not sure he remembers exactly what he cares about. You do know trump has given the most money ever to historically black colleges right? Did you cash the stimulus check? You know who gave that to you right? or are you gonna say you didn’t cash it?
You can’t blame Biden without blaming the support and money from the left. Joe Biden is only a symptom of the disease with the Democratic Party at this point...
2021 will be our best financial year, because Joe Biden will be president
I remember when Bernie supporters spread a fake rape story about Biden. Not once but twice. Also harrased union members with death threats. Let's not forget the constant harassment of Neera Tanden.
In which country? Because we it’s not going to be the USA  Unless, of course, you are now backing Biden who will win bigly
Yo  is there a place I can get a yard sign for your campaign? And does anyone know where I get a Biden one? Or any other Ohio dem? I need me a yard sign

Any Biden administration priorities ($15/hr min wage, DC + PR admission, H.R. 1) is DOA in the Senate if they don't kill the filibuster.
Ari, have you apologized to Joe Biden and your followers yet?
yes. we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. get out and do whatever you can to get biden elected
One aspect of strong polarization is that people's beliefs about the news are driven by their beliefs about the parties, rather than vice versa.   Biden's been leading Trump by 8-10 pts for over 3 months now. At some point, people's opinions get burned in and won't be changeable.
We’re Obama and Biden in the planning stages of helping inner city neighborhoods for 8 years? Nothing was done. No one got help. What is their excuse?!
A nice start to a policy agenda for Biden. Add a climate change initiative that cleans up all the damage done (and then some), working toward Medicare for all and free daycare, etc, etc...
Yes, "WE" Biden supporters will win BIG! Thank you for acknowledging this. Your starting to wake up🤣.
Always love his speeches!!!!! I wish he was back!!! Thank God for Joe Biden!!!!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻👏👏
"Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason." So Olsen said then that this is treason. What does he think about it now?
It's amazing that you have so little self-respect, and that you're willing to trample your own integrity in the gutter rather than apologize to Joe Biden and your readers.
This is an important note  "Biden’s 10% lead has remained relatively stable since our first swing state voting intention in May.[1]"
Biden better win big, because this country will tear itself apart if this happens.
Trump's lead narrows, Biden is declared winner in a number of states when its certified. Trump protests, Republicans protest and say Dems cheated, lawsuits are filed, and the Supreme Court has to rule on whether ballots should be counted after election day.
The problem is that 35-40% of the country that's his hardcore base.  If they just stomp their feet and say Biden's "not my president," so be it.  But, if these folks want to start "exercising their 2nd Amendment rights" at boards of elections, statehouses, etc., we have a mess.
Biden and Obama gave us the ACA, an actual starting point. Trump has given us nothing but meaningless tweets and proclamations.
I've long debated whether creating a cabinet department to address climate, as this post proposes, was the right approach. I'm still unconvinced.
And this is exactly what Joe Biden’s administration will do right off the bat
Weren't you the one  back in April who retweeted an article that Joe Biden suggesting this would happen was a conspiracy theory?
Obama gives this great progressive speech and then probably gets on the phone to encourage Biden to pick another moderate in Kamala Harris as VP. It's his presidency all over again
The post office has a lot of Biden supporters handling the ballots. There are stories from IN, WV, FL, and TX, etc, in which postal workers were caught throwing away conservative flyers, and discarding mail-in ballots from conservative areas.
Don't want to  him but counterpoint - why risk your health to vote for Biden in person? I was willing to make that risk for Medicare 4 All. I'm not sure I am willing to risk it for whatever Biden stands for. (FWIW I've requested my ballot and I'm not sure Ohio actually matters)

You're pushing these fallacies because you know Biden has your number in November. You've already fairly lost a second term. Because you're despicable
Hey boomer why don’t you relax... I never said I supported trump. I was just pointing out the reasoning behind him continuing to boost about him passing a very simple test. Trump is an idiot and Biden has dementia, this is America
President Barack Obama endorses Joe Biden For President  via
How mentally challenged is this country if they elect Joe freaking Biden? They are so confident they will rig this election they let him be the incoherent candidate.
Doubtful.  This virus is from China.  They are to blame.  Not Trump, who implemented a travel ban and was then called xenophobic by Biden and Pelosi.
You can have a record stock market or you can have President Biden  but you can't have both
Hoping for an unquestionable Biden landslide. Gotta get trump out.
You do realize he’s only boosting about those test results because he knows Biden won’t be able to pass the test due to his early onset dementia
I pray that if Biden wins this Nov, he takes note of how much he owes to  &amp; the leaders of  &amp; bring them into his administration.
Support removing the Imbecile in Chief from office on November 3rd, the worst potus in history. Vote Biden for the 46th President of the United States!
What they aren't voting for Joe Biden? What if they are voting third party or write ins?
Remember the outrage over this? We were so young then.
So you’re throwing your vote for a mentally ill “slavery was choice” and “Harriet Tubman didn’t free the slaves” little man, are you dense? Kanye is a Trump supporter, there isn’t one possible way he can beat Joe Biden based on write-ins. Your vote is a waste.
That is exactly how I feel. If you are not for Trump now, you would be voting Biden or Dem. If they are truly undecided after three years and Covid, its remarkable. They are not really undecided, they are the "Shy Trump" voter.
There's nothing transformative here. Nothing.  Biden economic equity plan calls for investment in minority business and workers
Trump and Biden are the best we can come up with? What more proof do we need that the American political system needs reworked
We got our Biden sign today! #Vote2020 #Biden2020
I don’t think Biden knows where he is at right now. I do know if you don’t vote for him “you ain’t black”
This is my hastily drawn mspaint political cartoon (in response to Biden sucks, Vote for Biden). Forgive the low quality of art, but I felt I needed to put it out there
Pretty sad when they have to use Reagan to push for Biden.
1.) Narcissism won't let him go out looking like a loser. 2.) Fear of a Biden DoJ. 3.) Fear of losing control of the GOP.
Including Joe Biden, who said it in April and got lambasted by conservatives for such a libelous and scurrilous attack.
As Trump pulls out of Michigan... #OperationGrant
Joe Biden is good at predicting things:
Listen to yourself! The more people you let vote, the better chance Biden has to win.   Look, we can and should improve the security of mail-in voting and take measures to eliminate voting fraud. GOP won't vote for it. Put 2 and 2 together.  /argument
Lies on top of lies. Mail in voting is safer than voting booths which can be hacked as you know. But either way come Nov. I'm voting for Biden. I had enough of the crook in the Oval Office.
If you want the right WH to do right by manufacturing, ask  whether he sees more upside with Biden or Trump. And listen to him—he’s the gold standard.
Biden's Lies for Black (and White-Privilege Guilt) Votes

Hey  based on today’s statement direct from the prez, care to apologize for your wildly naive claim that Biden was wrong for daring to suggest Trump would consider trying to delay the election?
Without any evidence, RNC chair McDaniels calls poll numbers showing Biden leading 'inaccurate.' She might be more credible if she says misleading, or skewed. Even 'early' would be a better description. Not inaccurate.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail    Biden said it....Trump will try to delay the vote. Mail-in is the best option for those not wanting to physically go to a location.Joe Biden’s search for a running mate enters final stretch
Biden doesn’t know his name or what Country he’s running for president in do you really think he knows wouldn’t an AR-15 even is??

It's time we vote trump out. Biden 2020
More life long politicians that have done nothing? Like Biden? And I don't even like Trump. The system ha slept everyone down.
If you’re not planning on voting for Biden in this election, please reconsider. Biden is not a good candidate. But he’s also not a dictator. Trump is openly admitting that he wants to destroy our democracy. We can’t fix our country if we live in a dictatorship.
You're not going to postpone shit. You have no power to do so. Only Congress has that power. In 97 days we vote your ass out. Biden 2020.
Trump vs. Biden: Where they stand on health, economy, more
God bless her. But I'm the only who feels like the Liberal wing of The Supreme Court is being held together by duct tape? But what if a President Biden nominated Obama for The Supreme Court Justice? I got your Merrick Garland, right here!
Laodiceans for Biden!
i think the majority of black ppl dont like  trump or biden
So you and Ryan are fine with losing this country to fascism to prove a point, or really to throw a tantrum because you didn't get you way. Either get on board or shut up. Bernie didn't win, Bernie has accepted and told people that Biden is the answer to an existential threat.
This would lose and it would be way easier for Trump to portray a Biden presidency as radical.
i dont feel like the majority of black ppl are political like that i think that 90 % just wanted Obama in bc he was black tbh i dont believe 90% will vote biden most things that i see black ppl hate biden
I disagree. Pence did wonders for Trump's support with the Evangelicals as well as those who thought he didn't have Government experience. Hopefully Biden picks someone who adds to the ticket.
WELL PRESIDENT BIDEN IS MOVING THEM RIGHT BACK, TRAITOR!!! A RUSSIAN TRAITOR TRUMP!!!
I have NEVER heard a better argument for Biden, honestly this is great
However, she also doesn’t like Biden very much either. She’d rather not vote at all this cycle, rather than vote for either. She said she’d vote for Tim Ryan (D-OH) if he were the Dem. Nominee though. Hometown guy. I’m willing to call that progress!
I think biden is worse...... but if you tell that to people you’re automatically a trump supporter. 😭 I pray he doesn’t win bro

Current battleground state polls with Biden up around 9 nationally. IF the lead nationally gets in the 4 to 6 range, it will be interesting to see where the battleground polls look then.
I can’t see Randy’s reply, I wasn’t saying trump is a mental giant. I think Biden has more to worry about on that stage than trump though. We’ll see, it should be thoroughly entertaining regardless. They’re both idiots in my book.
The DNC should honestly be doing everything in their power to keep Biden off of a debate stage. And if you’re a dem, you should be very nervous for that day. His competency is a liability to say the least.
Soo Biden didnt say no healthcare in a pandemic?
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Build Back Better? Isn't that the name of a book? Biden just can't stop plagiarizing.
You do understand that the Dems need to appeal to centrist voters to win the Presidency right?Seems to me they've double-downed on a losing strategy and gone way(crazy)far-left. Also,Biden probably has dementia. Trump gets 10-20 more electoral college votes this time...At least!

Oh so questions aren’t preplanned and rehearsed huh? WHO GETS TO SELECT THE REPORTERS AND THE QUESTIONS? Donna BRAZILE must be back at work helping Biden to cheat. She is sooooooo good at it. Oh but she’s a Christian. I forgot.
RUSH: All of the news that Biden's got it in the bag, that Biden's up by 10, 12, 13, whatever it is, they aren't true, they never have been true.
This is horrifying. And trump has the audacity to air commercials saying "You won't be safe in Biden's America." He is playing footage from Trump's America! Literally! I can't wait for November.
I mean, I want Kamala Harris to be Biden’s running mate but y’all act like she for sure has it and you’re setting yourselves up for disappointment.
The election 2020-Can President Biden win-His running mate can make a difference-If he goes to far left and chose a radical he lose! If he chose from the middle ground some one that has proven experience-he has a chance to win.I believe that person is Mike Bloomberg
You're right, of course, but so much can happen in that amount of time. Biden will have to become more visible, pick his VP and COVID is a wildcard.
That’s a chicken shit move if he doesn’t.  should set one up and tell Biden to show up and see what he does. Let the whole world see how bad Biden is.
We love you &amp; your Patriotism Terrence 🇺🇸 Hold your head up with your #MAGA Hat ....Biden says “You Ain’t Black” haha!!

I find it difficult to believe Biden would send in brown shirts to relentlessly fashion and assault protestors.
But we knew this about Biden. He’s been hawkish and anti-Palestinian the whole time. Americans generally don’t vote based on Israel-policy but the extent to which the Dems seem not to have been moved is infuriating.
It’s part of the Biden global plan. Teach Islam in our schools, kick out In God we thrust and we have Joe Biden being instructed by the puppeteer.
RUSH: What all of this means is that you shouldn't be believing anything in the news about Biden leading in the polls, about Biden being way ahead of Trump.
Chris “Waitress Sandwich” Dodd shouldn’t be involved with the Biden campaign at all. Whose idea was this?
RUSH: I&amp;#039;ve had a couple emails from people asking, &amp;#34;Hey, Rush, what do you think about this projection that Trump is gonna lose everything?&amp;#34;
Kamala when Chris Dodd asked her why she attacked Biden at the debate
1. Biden has never said he would ban gay marriages, and he has supported them at least 12 years. 2. You are correct, a pervert and hypocrite should never be President,unfortunately one is president and he needs removed.
Hey world, we may be back soon.

What are the odds...on my 45th birthday today, I get accosted in my own damn yard for having a Trump sign hanging up. 45 years old, 45th President. Never in my life have I seen such a thing. Bet if I had a Biden flag it would have been a different story.
And Clinton is a private citizen who is not running for any office, Trump on the other hand...is running for office, is an accused sexual predator, has paid teenage girls to keep quite, lusts after his own daughter, and a serial philanderer. Biden is none of those.
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
Biden’s rapid response director is trash
You have a binary choice in November. Trump or Biden. A vote fora 3rd party candidate IS a vote for Trump. So you didn't vote for Trump directly in 2016. And stop believing in talking points and start reading what people say.
Yes, I can tell you Biden will not get rid of the police. Do you know why I say that? It is because NO ONE is talking about getting rid of the police. They are talking about changing how policing is done. Also, he is not getting rid of the American Dream.
Trump cares about trump no one else. We need joe Biden in office now. More than ever.

Three sentences, four clichés. Biden’s Tweet writer is overpaid.
We have three Trumps signs out in the neighborhood and about 21 Biden signs.  I am in Ohio!
Biggest thing I disagree with is if Biden gets in things won't get back to normal.  Democrats will be empowered to take more control of your lives.

Umm,this is Trumps,America,he is president,not joe Biden ,this isn’t happening under Biden’s watch,it’s happening under trumps

Wait a minute, Joe...so Washington, Jefferson, and Grant weren't racist after all??? I'm so glad you clarified that for me. #senile

I have seen a few biden signs. But no running mate
They left it up to us, and the majority chose him. How much more choice do we need??? I'm all for anyone but Trump, but voted for Biden in the primaries because he was there only one left, pretty much. I wanted to vote for Elizabeth Warren, but she'd already dropped out.
Biden Forgot A Few Racist Democratic Presidents
People that want high taxes, high unemployment, a weak military, no law enforcement, open borders, &amp; huge unfunded social programs will vote for Biden. They don't want their guns or freedom of speech. Let's also not forget dirty dealings with Red China.  Follow the money.
He tweeted about Biden at the same time you posted this tweet.
Do you recall all the liberals saying trump supporters would take up arms and start a civil war if trump was impeached. Now to current events...who is causing chaos and anarchy...liberals/dumocrats. Vote Biden... if this is what you want for America.

No. Biden wants a black female to better his chances of winning. Biden had always been a very racist person. He has said it on live television
Trump already lost?? You don’t even know what you’re talking about bud. You can support Biden all you want. 😂
There were no facts given !! It’s like me saying Biden is one of the two well known politicians that Maxine has film showing these people raping underage  sex from Epstein Island!!

If Biden gets in office...👇
He has a right to brag.  Unlike Joe Biden, Trump has his right mind. Why on earth anybody would want Biden in office is beyond me.  I believe the Dems want him in office with what they think is a good running mate then kill him off to have the VP REPLACE HIM.

So very true. Trump hates (learned that from his father) whereas Biden loves. Biden learned that from his Christian upbringing and his continued Christian values. Love always wins. Hate goes into the fire and dies. #SuburbsForBiden #SuburbanitesAgainstTrump

I did read what you said. Biden won. He is where most of us are.  I like the 88.

GO TRUMP. Biden and his socialist WILL destroy our great country. AOC, Omar, Schumer, Schiff and the old bitch Pelosi hate Trump so much they will destroy America. God Bless America. Vote Trump.
Liberals blame Trump for everything. If Biden gets in, they will be begging for Trump. He has done so much for our country, but the liberals hate him. Biden will only win if the democrats cheat. If he wins his socialist partners will destroy America. GO TRUMP.

Wait...people really think Biden is going to win by a landslide...??
Biden wins by 10+ pts....
I get that some people make speaking errors. U do realize that Biden stutters? As a medical issue, not as a common error. Trump has mocked disabled people, made sex comments about his daughter, and uses insults to seem powerful.
So, name one thing Biden said that was unintelligent?

Joe Biden ... TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!!
Time for Biden to do an interview with Chris Wallace and agree to one debate with Trump. That's enough to legitimize his candidacy. No need for more than one debate. He can do other interviews if he chooses but he must do at least one on the "road." 100 days til the election.

I’m more in the Nixon camp, though. The racial fear thing isn’t working at all, though. His numbers in the suburbs are going to go even lower as he doubles down. Mix in a second wave in October and November and I think Biden could win by the biggest margin since 84.
Not a word in the   about the substance of Joe Biden's housing plan. Not. A. Word. But by all means, go after Trump for trivial nonsense.
Do normal people allow a candidate for the office of President of the United States hide in his basement 3-months before an election, never take a spontaneous question from the press, and never be asked any questions about this:  Biden Corruption:

Blaming Biden is a huge reach.  There are hundreds of others more reasonable to blame if you’re looking for someone.  But it starts at the top.  And our President continues to prove he’s a clown show.  The Republicans got what they want.
Biden participating in the same delusional “my opponent will steal the election” that Trump sometimes dabbles in. Not a good look.
My Mom passed of Alzheimer’s last year and as much as I can’t stand Biden, those who are ignoring the warning signs are grossly negligent.
Details of the recently released polls of registered voters in Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania:
Remember when he dumped on Biden and DNC for doing this? 🤔
Someone ask him about:  Biden Corruption:      (more)
Master class in how to handle Trump’s BS!  Stop him in his tracks. Don’t let it slide or let him talk over you. Biden’s team should use as a template
There are literally dozens of these.  But here is one from Biden this year...
The problem is Biden is the nominee.  And he vocally supported that policy.  So by voting for him, you would be reaffirming that policy.  Now, if you say you are going to vote against Biden, then you might have an argument.
Send them to Republican cities to.  There is lots of murders and unrest  in Republican cities.
Yea - rioting, looting and arson, terrible school systems and income disparity caused by terrible governance for decades leaving residents in crime ridden cities with too few jobs and ill-prepared people are just awesome.  Pretty much the model for a national campaign.  Go Biden!
Biden can't even string a sentence together how in the world do you think he can lead a nation. Biden would be hiding in a bomb shelter.
Lets not forget that Biden is a pedophile, and corrupt. Colluding with China. All the while getting rich because he can be bought out.
And then say “look at all this terrifying footage taken in the last few months...” in Trump’s America and say “this is the horror awaiting you in Biden’s America.” As if it isn’t actually happening now, under Trump.
Agreed.  He's going to make sure the American people don't forget this issue.  If Biden won't debate, he's toast.  If he debates, he's toast.  Rock, meet Hard Space.  😉
Okay Dale, now do Joe Biden.   Heck, while you're at it, do Don Lemon.  A transcript of any conversation looks like that.  But you know this.  You just did it because you're small-minded.   You were that kid who got his lunch money stolen, every day, weren't you?  #SMH #CNNSucks

Biden's silence is proof that isn't true.
This needs to end.  Either Democrats, from Biden on down, demand this is shut down... Or are openly on the side of chaos and injustice.  Pick.  There really isn't a middle ground at this point.
I am an Asian American and I can tell the difference.  I am Japanese and I do not appreciate Biden’s remarks at all!!!!!!!
TRUMP IS A RACIST.  HE HAS DONE NOTHING FOR BLACK OR BROWN PEOPLE.  EXCEPT TRUMP VIRUS HAS KILLED MORE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE THAN WHITE.Ive decided the Biden presidency would be like the old movie Weekend at Bernie's, except it would be weekend at Biden's.
Its possible because the dems are so crazy far to the left and people think Biden has dementia
"AP FACT CHECK: Trump Distorts Biden's Position on Fracking" by The Associated Press via NYT
I wouldn’t mind that either but I don’t think Biden is our answer for that in fact I don’t think we’ll have a candidate like that for at least 4 more years because I think you’ll see reasonable more reasonable candidates and it won’t be about “beating Trump” anymore.
I don’t think Biden is a return to normalcy and I don’t think there is a path to normalcy the Democratic Party has moved so far to the left that a lot of moderates like me don’t even wanna vote for them anymore.
Turns a eulogy into a campaign speech to help Joe Biden who can’t string two sentences together.

God I WISH. Calling Biden radical is absolutely laughable
You're truly not very bright. You support Biden who is heading down the Socialism pathway. One step away from Communism, which you claim to hate. Truly stupid.

Kasich is fantastic im a middle leaning dem he has to pick right for guys like me who don't like Biden to begin with. There's a lot like me!
Wanna bet? He isn't much better than Trump to begin with. Dems really fucked this one up picking Biden in first place. He needs to pick Bernie

KEEP THE FAITH ‼️‼️  HOLD ONTO HOPE ‼️‼️  WE WON’T ALLOW A BIDEN PRESIDENCY  Joe Biden lead in battleground states have dwindled since the past two weeks.   Trump only down +2 points in Pennsylvania ‼️‼️  #trump #biden
The right doesn’t have a monopoly on what it means to be an American.  Nor do soldiers.  Thank you for your service. It gives me the freedom to support Joe Biden and speak against systematic racism.
Romney is a joke. Typical establishment who will flip flop on issues for votes. No wonder he’ll endorse Biden who does the same.
Wow two establishment politicians who flip flop on issues for votes...    Seems reasonable that Romney would endorse Biden.
Joe Biden, brainless zombie for president.
(Two choices* ) Continued* the person who will best fit my agenda as an Americans which is to have less government, keep out socialism, protect religious liberty and not let us go into foreign wars. Trump actions trump Biden’s past record/current agenda for me on those issues
This Jo Jorgensen chick is the only sane person on the 2020 ballot lol fuck Biden and enough trump.
I know Biden is more popular than Clinton. I think Trump can win but it will take higher voter registration for him
Just because Dr Immanuel wouldn't let Biden sniff her hair
Also Trump dated a black person so he’s not? You can’t use the “I have black friends” card to prove someone ain’t racist. Biden has racist tendencies.
Biden was chosen to get the racist democrats. No way Obama wins if he picks a black VP because racists would freak out.
2021 will be our best financial year, because Joe Biden will be president
Imagine fighting agaisnt lntegration of busing. Busing affected schools you go to. Biden was afraid of his children growing in a “racial Jungle” (his words) and opposed busing. He’s a racist joke.
And Biden makes errors too. Pobody’s Nerfect!
91% freed by the First Step Act passed by Trump were black Americans. Many who were in there due to mass incarceration caused by Biden’s crime bills.
You don’t know anything about me but that I hate Biden and will rather vote for trump. Don’t speak for my character, sir.
If trump is racist then Biden is
If elected he will be a one term. Have two years to pass stuff, gop takes over Congress and then nothing gets done because Biden’s proposals are so left.   You trust Biden negotiating with countries like North Korea and traveling on plane constantly? And making speeches? LOL
I think for myself. I research. Biden is a FRAUD! Been in politcis for 40 years. He doesn’t believe half the shot he’s running on. He just needs to do it for votes! #NeverBiden my generation WILL NOT vote for him
Lol it only takes a little research to see how what my generation is fighting against is what Biden supported and helped create. fact is, he caused the mass incarceration of black people. #FuckBiden
Joe Biden has been in politics since the 70’s but HEY.. he’ll fix the issues THIS TIME!   Helped cause mass incarceration of black people  Helped kill Manufacturing sector  Voted for Iraq war and as VP, pulled troops out which caused Isis to take over territory  WHATA GENIUS ‼️‼️
That’s why I vote Trump because Biden has a failed record on foreign policy and helping strip working class of good-paying manufacturing jobs. Biden has been in politics since the 70’s (when he defended segregation). It’s time for him to step down from politics.
He actually has no bearing on us supporters of #maga - he did his 8 years. I even voted for him. Id rather vote for a pile of dog poop then biden. Your party sucks ass with all the extreme lefties and riots.
Exactly. Trump has been a disaster for America. His leadership regarding Covid has been non-existent. He is a childish habitual liar who has created division and hate at unprecedented levels in this country. Biden is not Trump. He’s a leader. That’s plenty of reason to vote Biden
...done with budget reconciliation, just really only economic and budgetary things though, not new states and regulatory reform, but really the biggest things on Biden's platform could still be done. And honestly I'd watch Manchin's floor speeches in favor of the filibuster to...
We have literally the two worst candidates for President. Trump and Biden. As worst as 2016. I'm so done with politics.
Don’t worry Joe Biden will fix everything, just ask him!
has done more in three years then Joe Biden has done in 47. #Election2020
Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United states of America &amp; Kick Donald Trump all the way to Russia
Joe Biden takes black vote for granted.   Trump has tried to earn it with ACTION.   Biden said “you ain’t black” if you vote Trump.   I say prove him wrong and vote Trump who has proven record that helped black community. He even banned chokehold and encouraged police reform.
The person asking Biden was talking about more funds for mental health and housing. Biden said I agree we need more funding. The person then said would you commit to redirecting some of the police funding? And he answered: yes. So yes, Biden does want to defund Police.
DO NOT VOTE FOR BIDEN. BIDEN HAD 40+ YEARS TO FIX THESE ISSUES. HE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A POLITICIAN THAT TALKS NICE WORDS BUT ACTIONS ≠ SPOKEN PROMISES.
DONT VOTE BIDEN!! Failed on foreign policy his whole LIFE!!
Biden voted for Iraq war that made youth like me go over and die in a place we should never have been. Then he and Obama pulled troops out and caused Caliphate to take over land. Leading to more troops having to go over there. Trump defeated caliphate and pulled out troops.
The only way she agrees to VP is Biden agrees to step down and she walks back into white. House
Pandemic hurt EVERY economy in the world. It’s who you trust to help rebuild it and I saw what Trump did for me and my family/community. I trust Trump over Biden in regards to economy.
I see that as another awful candidate running for president with a bad person. Lol I don’t worship joe Biden like you worship trump. I don’t like trump or Biden they both suck. I’m not offended when you say Biden’s a bad guy cause I know both of them are bad 🤦🏻‍♀️
And he's become less eloquent over years but really, you're not doing your side any favors with expectations. Actually a watch some of his recent interviws *in full*, or the Bernie debate. If expectations are too low for the debates and Biden does ok, alarm bells will ring in NY
Okay what? The entire point of the image was me pointing out that Biden's notes are coherent (not as complete sentences obviously, they're notes) while Trump writes ransom notes with bold sharpie. Also Biden's handwriting makes ME jealous!
So either Joe Biden wins and dies and we have a female black president( He’s picking a black female for his VP 4 candidates) or trump wins and does some crazy shit   Grab your popcorn folks
Yeah that’s disgusting. Never said I supported Biden though. I don’t support trump or Biden they both are absolutely horrible. The thing is, I don’t sit here and worship Biden like you worship trump and his actions.
Hi, just a lame Biden supporter dropping in to remind you that Biden isn't losing his mind and you benefit the one with a really really weird mind if you spread that disinformation
Neighbor put up a Biden sign. Despite having very limited interactions over our 2 years together I now have strong urge to hug him next time I see him. Socially distanced of course.
In addition to what SiriusLyndon said, I don't think it's that bad an idea if the Biden team thinks they have this locked up. A solid EC win+California helping him get a 10%+ popular vote margin is quite a mandate. I doubt they're so confident though, nor should they be
He looks good compared to this lady. Its all perspective. #maga #trump #Biden
Hope Biden has some kneepads and plenty of Viagra for her
Lol Biden is mentally gone!he obviously has Alzheimer's or something .. I love your pic.. Harris Biden.. didn't she call him a racist? She has to spend more time under a desk to get picked for  VP
Joe Biden Says Women Need His Help to Succeed in America
They’re facts. And You know those are all good things. This virus that pretty much is the only thing Lincoln Project can talk negatively about has inflicted EVERY nation. I know who fought for free trade deals that hurt my state greatly (Biden). And who caused mass incarceration
And Biden helped those racist bills pass and become laws
He’s done more for me and my family and friends than Biden did in his 40+ years in politics. Facts is, MY GENERATION is fighting the racist crime bills and laws that hurt black Americans.
Can we have the first debate just be Biden and Trump taking a competency test live on tv?
Right again as always Michelle.  That's why we all know that whoever is his VP will become president within weeks of inauguration day.  SHE scares me more than Biden does
Biden can't even finish a thought.. even if the DNC cheats again and gives him the question no way he can beat anyone in a debate! Hell he hasn't even taken questions from anyone yet his handlers just come up with a lame excuse why he can't ...
Ya WTF is wrong with the Republican party they say their Americans but act like Russian puppets vote them all out of office vote blue up and down the ballot vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
I question the sanity of anyone voting for joe biden. Seriously! Trump is far from an angel but he sure beats the alternative.
Those same people have said Joe Biden is the same as Trump. Everyone is the same as everyone. So why vote at all? Bernie is Trump. Warren is Trump. Kamala is Trump. Everyone is the same. And yes, the people saying it serve one purpose: helping Trump. #LRT
Show up and vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America vote up and down the ballot vote
Yes yes Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America
President Joe Biden it will be official in November the following morning after the election.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Go away Bernie. I’m voting for Biden. Don’t make me regret it.
I don't disagree with any of that, I was specifically just doubting you saying he was "against desegregation" which just aint true. I'm not comfortable with Biden's racist past, but it's my opinion, because his platform is now so much better, that he would be an improvement
Anthony Fauci till's the truth about the coronavirus do not believe Trump's propaganda machine Trump every single day he will say nothing but Lies to get reelected  Vote blue vote Joe Biden for PRESIDENT of the United States of America and save America
I may vote for Biden now because of this speech............for "asshat of the year"
No ... it’s tied / Biden behind.  Keep pushing and vote!
Biden's education plan would level death blow to private and religious colleges
Fuck Biden
Trump won't sign it but Joe Biden will in January
and also why r u pretending biden isn't going to contribute to the systematic racism in america LOL  just bc ur a democrat doesn't mean ur not racist, it simply means u think u deserve the minority vote
OK so Donald Trump canceled the RNC Jacksonville And Joe Biden canceled the DNC months ago, who do you want to be your president somebody that leaves by example or somebody that kills tens of thousands of Americans before it’s time
When is Joe Biden &amp; Obama's  Podcast air and how can I get it
I don’t want Trump or Biden
Economics as a class is going to be destroyed. It’s being taken over by “social” economics which isn’t really economics. Biden’s policies will hurt the economic growth. It doesn’t take much common sense to realize what helps spur economy and what hurts it
nah i know many democrats who r very very against defunding the police lol  keep in mind democrat's elected biden...
And for Biden voters, aside from your hatred of  why are you voting for Biden? Does anyone have 1 legitimate reason?How much did pelosi feinstein hunter biden earn
#WhateverHappenedTo the guilty person that held up sending US troops to rescue our American Ambassador to Libya on September 11, 2012? Was it Obama, Biden, Hillary Clinton or Panetta? Democrats covered it up to reelect Obama. Who was it?
Since Biden plans to lose Ohio to Trump, can I vote 3rd party or is that still giving Trump the election?
No doubt.  You have a place in Biden/Harris cabinet, I have no doubt!
Don't speak that evil into the world. ”When” he loses or when Biden ”wins”
I legitimately thought Joe Biden was Donald Trump when I saw his Twitter profile picture lol
#Biden/Harris2020!
The hacks led to bogus tweets being sent out July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
How is the president using the office for private gain talking about a pizza shop? This is no different than Biden eating $10k worth of Jeni’s Splendid Ice Cream.
I hope that we finally get rid of the moronavirus that's in the White house and  finally #EndTheNightmare on November 3rd and that Biden crushes Trump in the election🙏🤞
It's Fake News!! The People that Died will be mail in Voting For Biden!!!     Kidding Of Course.
Joe Biden will kick his ass in a debate
You do know Obama and Biden brought the economy back and Trump claimed it but thank God now he can't run on Obama's economy he's running on his own
I remember reading Republicans are giving him till labor day to turn things around vs Biden. Their best course of action would be to back impeachment and run Pence on the ticket to try and save the Senate.
Starting to see Biden signs go up in my Ohio neighborhood 😁
US election: Biden pledges billions to improve racial equality
I refuse to withhold my criticisms of Joe Biden.
And that relevant how? My believes are completely consistent. If it's the Trump creep show where he has been recorded making comments on the appearance of underage girls vs photos of what Biden kissing a little girls head grabbing a lady's face (with no context).
So Dan is supporting the pedo Biden...ok
Trump will not save us. Biden will not save us. No political leader will save us. It is Christ who saves. Politicians can do good, but they cannot fix what ails us most of all. They cannot renew our hearts and defeat death.
If  just said I’ll be competent he get my vote.
You can't tell me Joe Biden and Donald Trump are the same. Only one of them killed Jamal Kashoggi and Herman Cain.
Don’t stop speaking out. I spent hours yesterday being shit on by BBs. One of them said they literally wanted RBG to die. Another one said I was MAGA and against BLM because I will support Biden in Nov. They are truly nuts
You’re so outraged but say nothing about Clinton and Gore! I also assume you won’t be voting for Biden? He raped/violated at least 8 women!!!! Don’t be a hypocrite!!!
Biden literally was on top of the polls throughout the primary until Warren knocked him below 20 pts lmao
I just do not get the change of heart.  We have a pandemic that stopped a very robust economy.  Do you really think Joe Biden who wants to increase taxes and regulations is the answer?
When do the Harris/Biden bumper stickers come out.. I am a Trumpster...but I would put that on my car...#Biden2020 #Trump2020 #Democrats #BLM #MLB
Journalists are obsessed with Twitter. How is that for journalism? Also, forget Twitter when it comes to mental acuity or decorum, that's another issue in itself. A main issue is that Joe Biden is not up to speed. Unless it's on a Teleprompter or he has a handler
Stop saying facts about the Biden camp!!!
Biden's higher in the polls, but this seems like a party lines election. Both sides don't want to concede power and both sides don't like who's representing them (in general).
Biden finally Unveils Plan to Fight Racial Inequality after 40 years in public office. 🤣
It’s just sad AF that ppl truly believe Biden is a better choice
You will be calling more than balls &amp; strikes if Biden wins.
Biden knows it isn’t safe to return our youth to school. Putting our educators and administrators at risk doesn’t help anyone and will only serve to spread this disease further. Remote learning should be the norm at least for the first semester.
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?
If that were the case no Democrats should have gone. Joe Biden spits more racial slurs in a day than David Duke does in a year.
Not a fan of Biden I do know ain’t enough money in the world to make me vote for trump. The cat and mouse gane for his VP pick is like waiting to see who made the varsity cheerleading squad. OVERIT
So I suggest you vote for Biden, higher taxes which will decimate middle class, defunding good police along/bad, invite China to continue spying within our borders, allow illegal immigrants to flood country, stop energy programs that employ millions. That's to start. He's yours.
No, those stats were not true and whatever countries may laugh will need due to the President holding them responsible for not pulling their fair share. Let them laugh. Obama, Biden and Co attempted to drive Trump from office which is treason. Indictments coming.
Biden did nothing the 8 years he was vice president... except profit for his junkie son and him self...
Biden is ass. But I am not voting for Trump lmao
I feel like you think youre in charge of a lot of shit that you arent. Haha. I’m voting for Biden. A lot of people are. Bye.
They’ll push ANY other story in their blatant attempt at keeping the corrupt Biden’s out of the news.  Biden is only running for  to keep safe from prosecution.
Everyone I talked to says what are we going to do If Biden gets in. With the crooks in the world who could change mail in ballots and replace them with new ones.
What do y’all make of Trump actively sewing doubts about the outcome of the election? Does it push you any closer to voting for Biden? 👂🏾👀👂🏾
Russian interference was proven. I’m not suggesting anything. Centrists are just fine with Biden. Not worried.
I’m going out on a limb...Biden will NOT be the candidate.  Something crazy will happen at the Democratic Convention.  If I’m right you heard it first!
YES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AND DEBATE BIDEN
If you hate biden so much then close your eyes and see RBG’s name. She won’t live another 4 years. The least we can give her is someone who will replace her with a non-frat boy
Do you see what Trump is doing daily? Do you know what he did today? Stfu now with Biden. I will take ANY adult over a child at this point. I’ll take my 20th candidate over him. I’ll do what it takes to save the citizens of this country
Also, you’re just mad Bernie is out. We got what we got. It’s Biden or Trump. That’s the choice. There is no other choice. If someone offered you literal shit to eat or decent but not perfect meal, you gonna really eat shit or starve to death? Stop being a 2 year old
I’m sorry...dumbass  says what...
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
If this was 20 years ago, Biden would probably be described as being on the right. Don’t see how he’s a socialist.
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.
Those troops likely aren't going anywhere. It will take months of planning just to figure out where they're going. By the time they'd be ready to move, President Biden will cancel the order with day one executive orders.
Nobody cares about where you were born and really at this point in the game, we don't care if you vote for Biden or not.  This election is to important.  Biden or Trump; sorry it's a no brainer
At least 40% of people will believe him too...  Either way it won't be an easy win unless Biden pulls it off on Election night
If my district is right, Biden narrowly gets it
my goal is Nov. 5th. 24 hours after Biden wins and I celebrate the fuck out of that win.
Oh so, you are racist! Nice. Good to know. Biden has moved toward nearly everything Bernie wanted but it still isn’t good enough for you babies.
I've been shouting this out for awhile... You're NOT voting for Biden... You're voting for his VP... wake the phuk up!!!!
I think Biden will be a 1 termer, and Harris will probably replace him (or whoever is his VP)
Not all of them. I don't think Cheney was looking to run after Bush. And Biden likely calls it a career and lets the next generation try to win back the White House if a "normal" Republican had won in 2016.
It would be wild to see Biden reanimate one of those dead segrationist senators he worked so well with in the 60s or whenever, create an unstoppable zombie old white man vote-getting ticket, then stake them thru the heart post-election and appoint Stacey Abrams. And then retire.
Biden midterm could be rough.  Will probably see some disappointing surprises
Lolz. Hahahahaha. You’re hilarious. I am actually voting for the guy who has the most black support of all candidates. He was my 7th pick but I care about who POC want and they want Biden.
Hahahahah. You’re so ridiculous. No, Tara lied to try to harm Biden but Biden’s support was too big for Bernie and his loser bots
Never pegged you for pro Biden
What could possibly be worst then the catastrophic failure destroying our country right now ? Biden is the bridge out of hell and everyone needs to get on it. We cannot do 4 more of the last 4!! #RidinWithBiden
Surprised she didn't get more attention from the Biden campaign tbh
This is exactly correct, but the Veep spot has definitely also been a high profile launching pad for a run for the Presidency. This attempt to derail Harris may be from people who have other favored candidates in mind after Biden, and want to stop Harris now.
I agree on  . Since her crap campaign ended, she has been excellent on Covid recovery economics. She'll slice and dice Pence in debate. Rice is foreign policy centric, something Biden will not need partnership on. Harris is the perfect age a d competence.
Just by trump saying she'd be a fine pick makes me now hope Biden doesn't pick her. Remember he praises Bernie. Why? Because he would rather face hin then Biden. Just saying.
None of that has to do with how news media companies work. They have templates of things they know are going to happen soon enough already in the can. We all know Biden is going to pick the next Veep in a week or two, and we all know the shortlist.
You know what the Biden campaign needs?  A campaign song
Regarding VP I don't want Biden to pick a leftist because then that means a leftist has to campaign for him
Biden has way too much bagage that will be thrust on him in debates he wont be able to ride out or ignore. Dems cant get out of their own way even in a sitch where the perpetually spineless right should get flogged and the cancel fad will end his WH bid in stunning fashion.
So you are OK with four more years of Trump, which will likely result in a dictatorship. Then, your issues will become irrelevant. The fight in November is to save the country from Trump.  The only way to do that is to vote for Biden. Everything else has to be set aside for now.
Y'all seriously can't tell me Biden would ignore a Supreme Court decision.
And yet you support this president! Come out and say you’re supporting Joe Biden for President if you’re really concerned! #Biden2020
Biden expected to choose running mate next week
Y’all president rescinded the low income housing bill that Obama/Biden enacted. Another racist act by a racist president. Get this man out of office.
If Bernie was elected nothing would change.  If you want to see change it needs to done down ballot   Quit bashing Biden.  You’re no better than Trump
I’m happy everyone is on the Biden train, i made this pic before he announced he was running I've been #BideOrDie becuz it looked like trump was just trying to oppress us, i just never expected he’d try to kill us with a #pandemic also🤦🏽‍♀️ nvr trust #WhiteSupremacists 2protect you!
Joe Biden hasn't announced his running mate yet. That looks like a Bernie Bro, a bot, or a troll did it to get a reaction.
Those ~3 months between Trump losing and Biden being sworn in are going to be fucking nuts
Sad to read. A bite for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump. Biden will get you closer to democratic socialism solutions. Healthcare, food, housing for starts. Vow to remove Trump. That is step 1.
This is something the theater command will have an order counteracting for President Biden to sign within hours of his inauguration.
Because they would have a write-up like this for all the leading candidates so they can publish it literally the minute Biden actually announces it. Like obituaries for geezer famous people.
Biden: I’m going to prosecute anarchists.  *Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vancetti have joined the chat*
So in less than a week, we should know Joe Biden's running mate, as well as having a big primary night next Tuesday
“you won’t be safe in biden’s america,” they type above real video footage from trump’s america, trying to own their left leaning facebook friends (none of whom actually support biden)
see U.S citizens didn’t care 4 yrs ago!he is rich he can make things happen! $ is root of all evil! But our(U.S) greed will be our destruction!Biden not changing that!we need all new goverment by the people4 the people replace most old with all new and see +change not-
congrats on campaign once in a lifetime opportunity! But you say vote Biden if you took bipartisan out of it it’s like your promoting lesser of 2 evils which is not what I got from you when you were campaigning why now ? You have been bought by Biden obviously!
The worst part is in 2021 I can’t wait for the GOP to accuse President Biden of treason the minute he doesn’t declare war on Russia for the smallest dispute. Suddenly they will be hawks again.
ONE DAY, IT'S LIKE A MIRACLE, YOU'LL DISAPPEAR.   That day will come in January 2021 when Joe Biden takes the oath to become president. That day can't get here soon enough.
3/4: From  in the Independent
Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’   #NeverBiden #ComeGetMyVote
I'm voting for Biden, even if he's caught in a room with three women huffing drugs off ones red heel.
Today’s leak nonwithstanding, there is still a nonzero chance that Joe Biden picks Julia Louis-Dreyfus for his Veep
I couldn't get one kid out of the shitter and back to his machine for a half hour and it made me empathize with Jill Biden.
Yeah and stupid people in the suburbs will vote Biden because Trump hurts their feelings
Kamala Harris has been chosen as the standard bearer for black civil rights leaders, and was thus Biden's best choice. She's still garbage and we absolutely primarily her when/if Biden gets in office.
Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris. Although I absolutely despise Khive because they're disingenuous grifters, this was the best choice
If Biden was 1/100th as corrupt as Trump and running against a decent human being, I woukd not vote for him.
"Trump = Biden" is the other wing of the "communists = socialists = liberals = neoliberals" BS conservatives believe
These ads claiming that if Biden is president there won't be cops is hilarious when some of Biden's voting history has been borderline conservative. These ads are straight up propaganda now. They're not even trying to hide it.
Rice is more than qualified to take over as President if, god forbid, Joe Biden dies.
I'm curious, who do you think Biden should pick? I wouldn't want to be in Joe Biden's shoes right now.
Biden lives in his Basement... so what’s the big deal?? #HidingBiden #BasementBiden
HAHDBSBS WHY Biden snap like that 🤣🤣👎🗑
Will he actually try to do it?  If so, I agree these would be bold moves.  I'd rather have Medicare for All, but this would be better than current.  I don't trust Biden to actually do it.
Yes, putting limits on our insurance companies and/or providing a public option would be an improvement.  We gotta do something bold.  Do you trust Biden to do something bold?
I am including his VP in the "remove Biden" category. Realistically, the left has a better chance dragging the GOP to the left than they do dragging the DNC to the left. The DNC looks to the GOP for cues.
I genuinely think it sends a stronger message to prop up and remove Biden
Yes, after Obama made a few phone calls urging all the other centrists to drop out and endorse Biden.
That wasn't an accident. The DNC moved to the right with biden. You misunderstand.
I didn't vote last time and they moved to the right with Biden, my street got shot up and my family got COVID. I think I'd rather accelerate POTUS changes until someone ponies up and fixes shit.
Joe Biden won't quit because he can't even get started, unless it profits him or someone else in his circle.
I understand the grievances against Biden. But how many of us are in Trump's list of "anarchists"?
Yang did a semi-subtle call out on that DNC vote on M4A policy. Bernie supporters are replying to him with the "BuT yOu EnDoRsEd BiDeN" And I'm like mother Fulkerson I basically did too so stfu.
I'm sure that will help with outreach to young voters.
Except the vast majority of people support his plan. They voted for Biden out of belief in Biden's electability over Trump, and the exit polls show that. Insistence on private insurance and competition is insistence on the market, so yes, you are insisting that.
Because the dominant belief among democrats after March 2nd was that Joe Biden had the plurality of support, and he went on to easily clinch that plurality. Holding a grudge over Andrew's endorsement instead of working for M4A isn't helping.
(1) Andrew Yang was correct to endorse Biden (2) Andrew Yang has been incorrect in not pushing more publicly and heavily for healthcare, and that'a a genuine obstacle to a future run in politics that his fans so desperately want (3) Cut the guy some slack, he's a human being.
(1) Andrew Yang was correct to endorse Biden (2) Andrew Yang has been incorrect in not pushing more publicly and heavily for healthcare, and that'a a genuine obstacle to a future run in politics that his fans so desperately want (3) Cut the guy some slack
Facebook is trying to fix this election for Joe Biden cause Joe can’t win on his own!
What did Joe Biden EVER DO FOR BLACK AMERICANS? Answer: NOTHING! Why do you expect him to suddenly change and do something now? What did Trump do? Lowered Black unemployment to LOWEST IN HISTORY, created economic opportunity zones in cities, first crime bill to help blacks, etc
You don’t have any facts with your tweet. You’re as bad as ABC CBS NBC CNN MSNBC NY Times WASHINGTON POST, you just make up FAKE comments!!! Face it - Joe Biden is WRONG FOR AMERICA and YOU KNOW IT!!! AMERICA NEEDS TRUMP!!!
Joe Biden’s ideas are BAD FOR AMERICA! Joe Biden’s ideas would take AMERICA IN THE WRONG DIRECTION! Joe Biden and the Democratic Socialist Party are UNAMERICAN!!!  VOTE FOR TRUMP! Keep America on the path of FREEDOM AND LIBERTY FOR ALL AMERICANS!!!
This is Democrat’s doing so electing Biden will get this ten fold until America is destroyed Karen 😡🤬🖕🏼
Back when we had a thoughtful, intelligent president who listened to the experts on his team. It’s a beautiful photograph, a snapshot from a historic presidency. You must love Stanford, but if Biden calls on you, please be open to helping his admin correct the course.
Look at Local 12 trying to protect Biden's decline
That moment the ground shifts under the people who said it was great we off-shored our critical health care manufacturing capacity. #Covid19 woke up everyone. If they survived the virus assault w/out N95 😷 No where to hide now.  #reshore #madeinusa 🇺🇸
Didn’t Hunter Biden do something similar to this in the Ukraine??
Yes, only two of the three. One of the three will most likely be a draw, or a Biden win somehow. Depending on the category of discussion, I don't remember a time when a politician swept a series of presidential debates. Perhaps Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton, but not sure.
“People understand that a somewhat blind faith in free trade is producing undesirable results.” Well, yeah. But never doubt the intransigence of the offshoring mob.
How about the time he said Joe Biden had it in his plan that he wanted to defund the police? Blatant lie. Or the time he said the virus was at five and would be down to zero. Blatant lie.
Show what it is now with biden he is losing
You may or may not recall Rrump rescinded a lot of trans rights that were put in place in the last 8 years. Biden is liable to reinstate those. $15/MW, college debt forgiveness for those making 5 figures or less/year and public option healthcare all benefit people who are not me.
Recovering from the "Mother of All Hangovers," then rolling up my sleeves to help get America back on track.  Defeating the Abomination in Chief is the beginning. We have so much damage to repair now &amp; there's no telling how much more harm he'll do before Biden is inaugurated.
Biden did not win because of his platform.  80 to 90% of Democrats support Medicare for All.
I did same, needed to reread. 👀 They are definitely rooting for Biden.
Any vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. If you prefer Trump over Hawkins, well, best of luck.
Condi is a Repub., don’t think Biden will choose her. Susan Rice would be a most excellent choice.
WHO SAID? NoCatholic Can Vote For Joe Biden???
Joe Biden Shows Class👇
More likely to get a check from Biden, too
Interestingly, I think the debates will not swing many votes at all this time around. I see Trump winning two of the three, mostly because Trump thinks faster than Biden.
I'm not voting for Biden because of any of the fairytale bullshit. I get absolutely nothing out of voting for Biden. Not a single, solitary thing. Other people benefit and that's worth it to me.
The depths of his indifference remains incomprehensible. What an asshole The Independent: Trump says he won’t go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol.   via
Why on earth would Biden let someone accused of sexual assault be on his VP selection committee!?
You think Biden will provide any of this?  44 years in politics and hasn’t produced anything close to this.  How could you be fooled he all of a sudden will?
It's either kamala or Warren. Biden would be a fool to look outside the primary. Well, rephrase, his advisors would be fools
I love Susan for VP. And, she already knows the workings of the WH. Her and Biden make a full house.
Yes, she had her hand in that alright. Biden wrote the rules. You think together they can get those crime laws straightened out?
Her reputation is lousy on that one. What can I say, Biden wrote the legislation, she just carried it out. You think, together they can get that changed
Khive is trying to turn Black Lives Matter against Biden advisors. Sanders delegates are demanding healthcare. We are seeing the fissure grow.
Amigo can you share with me when AOC challenges Speaker Pelosi?  That is never happening.  She has been set straight.  Sanders is compromised otherwise why would he endorse Biden who is against M4All! No Democrat is standing up for PEACE. Rs &amp; Ds both fund the MIC #DemExit #Peace
From Steve Chapman a thoughtful conservative on Trump’s exaggerations and fear-mongering: Will Joe Biden destroy the suburbs? No. No president had such power.
Ive done it. Trump is one and the same with Clinton, Epstein, Obama, Biden, etc. Birds of a feather. He has endless documentation of his relationship and friendship with all the big wigs pulling the strings. We can disagree on this because you're right, the truth will come out.
Disappointed that Biden turned down an equal time interview with Mike Wallace at Fox News. This maneuver reminds me of the basketball team that's leading,  holds the ball for the last 5 minutes, momentum changes and they lose.#comeoutofthenasement
I swear to god  better turn off his hearing aid when talking with Chris Dodd. #KamalaHarrisForVP
It's not literally impossible for Biden to win by 7 and lose the EC, but it's vanishingly unlikely; it would mean state polls are missing badly, together, but in different directions, which basically never happens.
Biden is not the President, tho. You should be trying to beat HIM. I mean, you would if you weren't actually trying to help him with this foolery.
Biden’s plan doesn't provide universal health care.
Biden's plan doesn't provide health care to everyone.
Biden still does not know about the virus
Trump is starting the violence, Trumps guys beat up a vet standing with his hands in his pocket. Where's Joe Biden? Well every week he's putting out policies that will help bring this country back to normal
I did a quick search.... so is all to Kamala’s debating prowess, that she didn’t bow down and kiss Biden’s ass when she was RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?!?!!
Goodbye Mr. Criminal President. I hope the new AG for Biden holds you accountable for your crimes. #2020Election #Biden2020
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
And Biden has a media that will lie for him.......see you as an example
Yeah I saw the "Biden wants to remove the police" thing, which as far as I know he has never said anything remotely close to that
Seriously??..
Ask him again after he naps.  #FoxNews
Huh?   Biden cures Racism and a Virus?  I mean if so im in man.....but
Biden is refusing to provide health care as a right while Hawkins isn't. It's pretty simple.
Literally 100,000s more people will die if Joe Biden is elected over Howie Hawkins. People shouldn't have to die in order to allow corporations to maintain control over this country.
If I were Biden, I wouldn't even recognize Fox News existence.
Biden's First-Day-In-Office Plan Is A Betrayal Of Working-Class Americans
Democrats when Elizabeth Warren is running for president: LOL she's so racist she tried to claim she's 1/1024 NA! Democrats after Warren endorses Biden: Look, it's racist to call Warren "Pocahontas," what she did wasn't all that bad, she's fantastic
Trump is President right? So why are they Biden’s protest?
Wallace would  throw him soft balls anyway...biden may be able to answer them
Come on Scott.  Do you really believe these polls.  Just remember to look underneath and check the internals.  Almost always slanter to Biden.
#TrumpIsACompleteFailure for those who get their information from #CNN &amp; #Biden ...do your own research...no politician or news media tells the truth any longer in the quest for power...
Please, register to vote. Get out to vote. Your only chance to make a difference is to vote and to encourage your friends and family to vote.  Save our Republic and vote for Joe Biden.
I also see why he wouldn’t support Biden. My issue lies with the fact that either trump or Biden will win this election.  He is throwing a wrench in this that could go either way.  He isn’t going to win anything. The last thing we need is more chaos.
In his last manic episode he “supported trump”. In this one he “denounced trump”. So, that’s not a thing. Trump is racist. Google some shit before you start asking me for receipts. I’m not doing that. Biden isn’t a known racist. If he “supported Biden” it would make more sense.
Suburb of Dayton Ohio.  One Biden sign.  Trump everywhere
Weird how the only thing I've seen Biden say in a while is that ad where he and Obama talk about Trump saying, "I don't take responsibility" Biden's most effective strategy is flying under the radar and it's just weird.
At least be truthful, you know that isn’t Biden’s slogan
And so are the rest of us if Biden wins.
Joe Biden has done less evil than Donald Trump.
Which Trump 2016 state does Kamala help Biden win?
Logic by human mind leads to NO other conclusion. Logic says make columns w/headings of each record in Public Office: Trump’s Actions, Biden’s Actions; can even add financial picture: Trumps &amp; Biden’s Weath At Beginning of Office, &amp; Weath At End. Compare then list own Conclusions
If Biden is elected, and Trump goes, it doesn't mean that it's over and it's back to status quo. On the contrary.  No, the very fights about inequality of wages, healthcare, racial injustice, etc. will never again be on the back burner but we turn up the heat to boil!
So did they game out the far more likely scenario of Biden squeaking it out at the end by massive and obvious fraud and the normies saying "Oh fuck no you're not President!"?
Trump is in deep trouble, especially if our COVID situation, and with it the economy, doesn’t improve soon. But I largely think current numbers aren’t “real” until Biden picks a VP.
No one is disputing that. Could be Biden too...if Ghislaine survives, we should know “most” of the truth, but some may get to her to barter silence.
I CAN’T wait for the debates... America will see how UNFIT Biden is to be President
🤫Those are just the voices in your head. Everyone is voting for Biden.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is that why Biden is ahead in the polls?
I drive a delivery van for Amazon. Seen a few Biden signs in rural Ohio, too. Still mostly all Trump, though, including some setups that took some effort.
Given your history of embarrassing gaffes, mistakes, &amp; outright lies -- which you make in great numbers EVERY SINGLE DAY, I suggest that you shut up.  THERE IS NO OBAMAGATE, no matter how much you wish there was. Joe Biden on his WORST day is better than you can EVER hope to be.
Kneel, lay down, fart, walk away, put in head phones....you do you....but needs to stop being reported on by media for attention.  Oh WAIT i got it...ALLLL racial issues will go away once Biden takes office in November....WHEW....
Trump &amp; Pence Debut Hilariously Clueless 2020 Strategy That Might HELP Joe Biden  via
The Republicans ruin the economy and the Democrats fix the mess they left. Obama cleaned up Bush’s and now Biden will clean up Trump’s if he wins the upcoming election. If we get four more years of Trump this country will be unrecognizable.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I think Kamala would be an excellent choice.  She is strong, smart and a mover.   I have to admit that my first choice is Susan Rice however I'd be cheering for Kamala if she is the Biden pick.  :)
Biden is for going back to forcing people to buy useless health insurance. Just let people who are sick or injured see a doctor without worrying about the size of their bank account.
Remember during the primary when people said Biden was unacceptable? Maybe you should have listened to them if you wanted them to support the Democratic nominee.
I signed one petition about trump and now this nigga Joe Biden text me everyday 🙄
I have a Biden joke, but it doesn't make sense.
Cleaning up the mess that Biden created.
The black people supporting him realize he’s not a perfect man, but his policies overall have been better for black people. Better than Obama, so why elect Biden?
I had a Biden joke, but someone unplugged the teleprompter.
You're going to beat Biden off? 😂😂
Biden has nothing for black folks, Trump has done more, these are just facts.
In 2016, Joe Biden defended his crime bill that is as responsible for mass incarceration as any other piece of legislation passed in the last forty years, saying:
Everybody knows that Biden and Barack for a couple of crooks but this is a good thing it still needs to be proven
Remember in the primary when people said Biden was unacceptable? Maybe you should have listened to them if you wanted them to support your candidate.
Al Gore was a senator, VP, senator and state congressman. Joe Biden has so many years in government, congress, senate, white house that almost nobody alive today remembers the year he was elected in. Hillary was a skilled organizer and politician who got into high office.
Sounds good to me!  A vote for Biden is a vote for improving educations for ALL children
Joe Biden holds a basement rally somewhere under his house.
Me too in my little Ohio farming town.  All Trump/Pence.  We’re the only Biden household in town.
#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #Joe Biden for president 🤞we need to get Donald Trump out of the White house on November 3rd.
I find it amazing that the Dems were pushing the whole “ has cognitive issues” b.s.  Then they nominate a guy (Biden) who has glaringly obvious cognitive issues.  You just can’t make this stuff up!
And my guess is you are not seeing Biden signs.
Joe Biden would not only be the most progressive president, but the first president to ever do anything for Black America.
Biden's Plan For Corporate America - Politely Ask Them To Not Be Corrupt    Voting is important, but at least for now it's only going to work in down-ballot, local elections and even then only in some (Brian Kemp GA fraud).  We have to protest also.
And that’s why I’m saying I understand wanting to vote for Biden, but we all know Biden won’t fix things. He’s another corrupt, racist, abuser. We’re not gonna change the system by actively contributing to the system
At this point I suspect that a McGrath win would point to a Biden win by at least 100,000 and she gets enough "meh" votes from people there just to get Trump out. Can't imagine any other way
I get why y’all are gonna vote for Joe Biden I really do get it. But understand that picking “the lesser of two evils” is going to do nothing to end the corrupt two party system.
The president said that collection of nouns, or ones like them, was part of a cognitive test he had aced while declaring that his likely Democratic opponent, 77-year-old Joe Biden, could not do the same.
What did he do now? More “Bernie would have won?” Or “Biden won’t win”?
The Battle for Joe Biden    Once again, Joe Biden is misunderstood.  The value of Joe Biden is that he has a deep understanding of government and knows the persons who understand each issue better than he does.  He will form a great administration.
Calling it now: Biden announces his VP pick Monday
Arguments against Biden: -Complete jackass for 2 decades in office -gaffes, freak outs (why/nothing will change/etc.) -Milquetoast legacy so far  Arguments for Biden: -Won't threaten nuclear wars over Twitter -$15MW, PO Healthcare, college debt/cost reduction, Marijuana decrimin.
Biden is unfit to be President... but Biden voters are unfit too... #KAG2020
He could also lose by a little, and stage a successful Coup? Joe Biden winning is the best "worst case". He wins, then we fight him to enact Prog. policies, We get more House and Senators ellected that are Prog. The struggle continues
Lol Intolerable. Good One. #Trump2020 because America won’t survive under Biden, it’ll be sold out from Americans by Biden just like Obama did.
This dude Joe Biden ain’t even announce his running mate/vp yet...
And they know that Trump will lose his re-election.., they are scared because they know he's hated and that he's behind Biden in the polls in Texas.,Florida.,Pennsylvania.,should I name more States?  Even Fox News and Senate Republicans know that Trump is in trouble.
Had Biden been in charge durring COVID, half of us would not be here to comment on his ignorance. Here is what he did for H1N1 that would have wiped out half of the country by now with this virus.
Shouldn’t you be asking Biden that question?  You forced Trump to publicly say he’d accept the results in 2016, and have stood silent over Clinton and the Dem Party not excepting it ever since.  Repubs always have accepted, the Dems never do unless they win.
I hope you all still love and support  post election when she rightfully mocks some of the stupid shit Biden is saying.
People all have dreams to become a doctor, lawyer, artist, teacher, firefighter, actor or actress. We could have many more if those who can help sustain this place. It's a very simple move to make because you can all vote for a Joe Biden or any candidate that is helping this push
Look! Here’s the deal. Biden stepped in a pile.
Republicans will blame the depression on Biden, despite him not even being in office when it started, and most of the media will have orders from their owners to fake amnesia and repeat whatever Rs say as gospel truth, without question nor fact check.
Once again, you’re playing a fool, and this is the last reply you’ll get out of me. Biden says “those people” are a victim of society, but that doesn’t matter. He says “we created them” verbatim. Are white people victims of society? No. It is beyond clear who racist Biden is
😂😂😂 I shared a jimmy dore video because it had the footage of Biden’s speech. That was an incredibly poor attempt to manipulate my argument but you’ve done nothing but play the fool this entire convo so I can’t say I’m surprised.
Recent polls suggest Biden is at risk of failing to mobilize African Americans in the general election as effectively as Democrats did in 2016, even as he builds new support among white voters
Breaking #FoxNews Alert : FOX NEWS POLL: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania
I agree with pretty much every argument against Biden there is. I, unfortunately, promised myself I'd vote against Trump. There's no sense crying over spilled milk right now, for me. And, what's more, if we get a real $15 minimum wage push, I'll take it.
Folks.   Its 103 days til the election. This time four years ago, like Biden now, the media told us Hillary was leading by double digits.   Be on guard. The race is just getting started.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause I live in Ohio, and Biden/Trump are basically tied. Kanye was the only real progressive, so I'm left with Biden.
It seems Trump's re-election argument is Biden is a dementia addled old man. And Biden's campaign argument is - "who cares what I do, look at that dipshit, he's not even reading intelligence briefings, he's just on Twitter!" I think Biden's argument, right now, is stronger. 2/2
An unpredictable factor this election is going to be cognitive decline. Biden or Trump could very suddenly die, without warning. This was true with Bernie. COVID is a game changer because cognitive decline accelerates when you are having less social interaction, less work. 1/2
The same one with Biden+6?
Your inability to understand protocol and time and place doesn’t make what you say true. President Obama and future President Biden are here because the election was tampered with and we got complacent. That’s over. You’re over. This bullshit is over. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Trump can't win again getting 1% less this time because that means Biden will also get at least 1 or 2% more than Clinton did in 2016. The EC math just wouldn't workout in that case.
#ImVoting4BidenBecause Covid-19. I have no clue if Biden will handle it any better, but I do know, how it is handled now can NOT continue or we are going to be in serious trouble &amp; current leadership has shown this how they plan to handle it.
straight up facts, biden said that and you’re supporting a man who says this? and sniffs kids? and touches kids? need i go more, i can go all day long, i’m bored as hell at work
Do you see your boy Bernie Sanders constantly criticizing Biden? No he’s saying positive things about him and he’s criticizing Trump. Bernie understands there’s a job we need to do first!
Every single day he commits an impeachable offense. Nothing happens. Even if Biden is elected, what do you think will happen from November to January?
mind responding to this if you think biden’s the best.
Nah, Biden doesn't have 4 years in him. 2 years of Biden 2 years of Harris. (this is a prediction, not an endorsement of the idea, don't  me)
I had to take this same test he's talking about as part of an assessment for my TBI. This is a 2 minute clip and as he's explaining the test, he repeats the same example sequence 5 times w/o messing it up. Have Biden do the same thing in front of a person on air w/o any aid
Not necessarily. If all the Dems united around progressive policy Biden would have to change his platform if he wanted to win and things could actually get done. Incrementalism is what’s divisive.
Biden: "Trump is a racist"  Also Biden: "If you're having trouble deciding to vote for me or Trump, then you ain't black"
Come on....Biden doesn't even know where he is half the time.
Show the proof Biden has dementia. I think at this point we are just so use to the word vomit from Trump that anyone who takes a beat to pull a thought together seems an anomaly. Trump is the one who has to go.
I love that they think this is a good idea. All these quotes showing that Biden held ideas to the right of Trump will do is demoralize right wing voters. Who do they think this is this for?New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president  Wow so JOE BIDEN NEEDS to pick a woman!!  I think that would be a good thing but MY VOTE is NOT CONTINGENT on that!
WE THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF ALL THE BS!               All these"BUSINESSMEN" S/B fired when Biden is elected in Nov! The GOP are acting EVIL!👿👎
Dems would rather elect Biden, regardless of his racist views than re-elect Trump, who’s never proven racism! Go figure.
Lots of people are speculating about Biden's VP pick. Its the hot media clickbait story of the hour. But, as many have pointed out, this take from Politico, which has been echoed by other publication and (mostly white male) pundits is deeply problematic &amp; offensive.
I disagree. ANY change on Trump's part would signal chao. Trading reliable white male Pence for brown, female, openly ambitious Haley would infuriate Trump's base, which is racist &amp; misogynist. This would nail Biden's reelection no matter who his VP is. Pure media fantasy.
And you know this how, sine Biden is playing his cards close to his chest?
No one cares about that shit. Given Biden's age, I'm more concerned with who you're setting up for the future. Politically she's not strong — she has no electoral experience &amp; we have no idea how she'd perform as a candidate.
I don't think anyone knows who Biden will pick &amp; the media is just throwing shit out to see what sticks. Rice is certainly credible &amp; given the nature of the campaign this year, she won't hurt it, but she would be a weak pick for the future.
How does she balance the ticket ideologically? She is probably a a tad more progressive than Biden, but Harris is one of the most progressive members of the Senate. And let's give the idea that Republicans will "use" these phony narratives — they'll invent something for anyone.
Ohio will be blue this year. Former (as of yesterday) Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder handed Ohio to Biden with his arrest last week for taking $61 million in bribes to ram through HB6, to bail out coal &amp; nuclear &amp; kill green energy. Everyone hated it! Now they're reminded!
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election Even with some states too close to call right now, Biden has Trump beaten....
Duckworth would mirror Biden's personal brand in that they're both people who have suffered great personal losses, but remain committed to and caring of other people.
How can Biden embrace them? He had Dementia
You didn't say it but you did imply it. You think Biden wont get it done. Well nothing is getting done with trump. He actually implied that the election should be "delayed"
Good morning to  and only    "...there are Democrats who are still waiting for the white working class to come back to them. One white guy in Cincinnati is worth more to some Democrats than 100 Black guys in Cleveland."
also I'm ready to say, like Sherrod, that folks need to vote their conscious on Biden, and I know that a low-rent war hawk abuser is not as bad as a fascist serial rapist, but I'll be damned if folks ever gave Tara Reade a moment before running a bus over #MeToo
Your reaching with the Biden deal. It’s a joke. Like this President and administration he controls.
What drugs are you on? Biden’s so called touching of that girl was picked apart by everyone!!! Trumps the rubbing elbows with Stone, Maxwell and JE. Not Biden. Keep reaching bright one!!! Yet to you fucks, this is okay. See Biden didn’t have to pay off anyone. Trump did.
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists
Or more simply put - Biden is a prophet.
You wanna investigate Biden while trump over here thinking about postponing the election? What?!
I heard that, Biden has one foot in the grave and you have a younger woman who possibly could run the country ? Maybe ?
Joe Biden should let all these leakers go right now because they may well be like trump’s White House. I wonder if them leakers only voted for Biden? Biden/Harris is where we’re.
I think Warren was dropped from the list. I think Biden knows the reality: she's too old &amp; we'd lose her seat. That pretty much obliterates her qualifications.
Yea I might have to vote Biden off strength
Those executive orders will vanish when Biden takes office. Shouldn't you be planning your exile?
Hopefully Biden will press him on this during the debates.
Waiting waiting waiting waiting to see any sign of Biden in Ohio.
Please join me in advocating for more hearings and passage of my Paid Family Leave bills!  Also, FYI, my very few NO votes on DNC Platform amendments reflect my preference for Biden camp language over Bernie camp. They were not NO votes to the actual policies. Stay tuned🤜🏽🤛🏽💙✊🏽
I don’t get that either! What kind if idiots look at that and say “Oh boy that Biden look what he’s doing. Are they that dumb??
committing to burning a Joe Biden sign omw to voting.
Trump will probably not win Ohio. He can thank indicted Oho House Speaker Larry Householder, whose arrest last week probably gifted the state to Joe Biden.
I should thank Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder for gifting the state to Joe Biden last week. Thanks, Larry! Enjoy prison! Maybe I'll send you a card.
DO THE RIGHT THING in November &amp; relinquish your position to Biden, people MAY respect you a bit. You sir ARE A MESS~
Joe Biden proposed this several weeks ago. You’re so desperate you’re stealing his (good) ideas.
I just realized how the electoral outlook could get even better for Biden, and it scares the 💩 out of me.
Yes Biden/Harris match in heaven but Susan Rice is no Sara Palin though.

It was Hillary that didn't give her the job she wanted. She was never up or a job with Biden.

NESARA VS  NWO Trump VS Biden  America VS China Forgiveness of all debt VS  Be enslaved to debt 4ever Release all hidden knowledge to the public VS Vaccinations, lock-downs and tracer apps God VS Moloch Good VS Evil. What we accomplish in this life shall echo throughout eternity
She was elected to Congress mostly by Black people in Detroit area who voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden and now she’s defying them not to endorse Biden and causing troubles. Can’t stand her and Bernie Sanders, she’s worthless to her constituents. So she deserves to loose.
I guess I am not the only one who will #BeSilentNoLonger First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
Biden doesn't care what he internet thinks because someone somewhere is making a case for ONLY MY CHOICE &amp; slagging all the others.
What's to "prepare"? Everyone who is passionately attached to a single candidate &amp; thinks everyone else sucks should start "preparing." I don't care who but all signs do point to Harris. Biden isn't going to make his pick based on media &amp; internet opinions.
Me too, and Biden signs are everywhere, which is a sign of determination to turn out and vote. And we're one of the most populous counties in Ohio.
My entire city (Ohio) is a field of Biden signs. And we're populous and we vote.
OK, I looked it up. Half before, half after the news broke about the arrest of GOP Ohio House speaker Larry Householder, which is likely going to hand Ohio to Biden. It will shift even more toward Biden as people learn more about his involvement in HB6.
If he said it, he's a misogynist. Kamala said/did nothing wrong: Biden bungled his answer. And all they've done since is pretend it was HER fault.
That sentence is too long... Biden can't be president.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
We still need to vote as if Biden is the under dog!
Given that peaceful suburban white moms are the swing demographic that are switching to Biden en masse, maybe this isn't such a wise post.
"Feel Good" Story Shows Failure of Joe Biden's America!
Biden is a very nice a capable man for the job... it’s gonna come down to who he puts on the ticket with him.... I think it’s gonna be Susan Rice or Kamala Harris.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims  via
You are all living in a dystopian fantasy-land. I don’t see any Drumpf signs only Biden. Can’t wait for this nightmare to end.
Actually, Biden's messaging and strategy have been pitch perfect. And Hillary won PEOPLE in a landslide, the only element that can respond to messaging. Biden isn't remotely "right wing." Give it up, Berner.
Rubber bullets cause eye damage to lawful protesters , especially when you aim for their eyes. We'll circle back to this when Biden takes office.
donald trump is a hack &amp; con as is joe biden
biden is sad. this is the sickness of our system when only 2 parties as sdrawkcab as the  &amp;  are left to control the voting. we can be better. but i guess it is my fault i have only ever voted 3rd party since 1992 as i will in #Elections2020 for
many ppl see Joe Biden as no different than Trump. it has been said by   and others that the actions of  were given an open by things such as the NDAA given to us by  republicans are as shite as democrats. and this farce of a push to normalize
No matter what!!! Donald must go. I think Biden will fit perfectly in office. For the people. I think all Trumpers should be shipped off to Greenland!!! Wait I thought Trump wanted to buy Greenland? I fucking chunk of ice.
Damn trump trying to shut down a public service like USPS. That may be the reason I vote Biden because I don’t want mail to get privatized. Still unsure about Biden tho, still not voting trump at any cost
Biden will be the next.
So fucking what!! Biden has you!!! Bye bye POS!!
😂😂Biden wins...you are funny and delusional
There is ONE truck with the Trump flag! I want to ask them if they have a television?  I have seen MORE Biden signs in my northeastern Ohio town than Trump signs.  I am VERY happy about that.   I agree with you......REALLY?  I believe that Biden WILL WIN Ohio.
New Trump Ad Keeps Pretending Biden Wants To Defund The Police (Lol)
Votes Joe Biden is entitled to: Joe, Jill, Joe's vetting team  Votes he is not entitled to: Our Revolution, Justice Democrats, Media Men, John Morgan, Everyone else
You voting fa Biden?
Particularly since it was Biden who bungled it &amp; the media falsely spun it as big, mean, out-of-line WOMAN attacking the poor kind old white man.
Looking forward to Biden’s being mocked by villains like you for stuttering while speaking coherently and thoughtfully about important matters of state.
Lovecraftian would be Trump’s closet leading to an unspeakable cacophony of GOP monsters circle jerking into a pile of hair from Epstein’s innocents; Pyncheon would be Biden’s closet of bombs exploding banana trees sheltering families from sun at noon, gathering mountain water
Also, Baldwin is not on anyone's list, including Biden's. Nor is Hassan for that matter. Why are they setting up straw women here?
Sounds strange. Biden needs a VP who has won statewide and possible 2024 candidate for top job.
Kinda finished. Joe Biden is prone to gaffes so keep pushing like he’s down.
I’d rather another trump term than Biden if I’m being 💯
I donated mine to Joe Biden!! I thought that’s what Trump wanted me to do!! Haha
No VP candidate can influence any state or demographic that hasn't already committed to Biden.
Tell me Patriots 🇺🇸  Candidate Joe Biden toots  President Trump is the only    raciest candidate that ever   won the presidency.    WHAT  SAY  YOU ???
Okay we get it you don't like Jo Biden. You using your platform to tear him down! Who are you voting for Trump?? Kanye?? Enough already! Use your platform for something else. You are starting to seem like a Negative Nancy! A Debbie Downer! Geesh
Biden and Obama get together, take aim at Trump's coronavirus response:  via
It WON'T be now maybe NOV(ember) when Biden is elected.
RECEIVED! YOU wonder why people don't want to go back to work. DO THE FUCKING MATH! Lower CARES unemployment to $200 weekly in addition to what the state gives AND SEND EVERYONE WHO BRINGS HOME $40K or less a $5,000 CHECK &amp; let's see what President Biden will do in November. TheIt should be fairly obvious to everyone by now that “heels up Harris” is going to be chosen as Biden’s running-mate. None of the others can be taken seriously.
Maybe if Biden has strippers at his events more people would tune in!
I have recently taken Up food and grocery delivery as a side gig. I still haven’t seen a Biden sign anywhere in my part of Ohio, just trump signs and a few Bernie signs (I don’t think the progressives are going to vote Biden)
Not really. Biden advocated for and till this day praises nafta, advocated for steel dumping, and helped to push through The ACA which completely destroyed the job market here. China never had a greater ally.
Facts are facts. Joe Biden advocated for ever pro China trade deal, everything from nafta to the TPP. If he hadn’t been such a strong advocate for China America would be in a better place and China a weaker one. Now we are in a position where war with China is inevitable .
Joe Biden will not end cash bail.  It's bullshit. Supposedly, they ended cash bail in New York. That lasted, what, six weeks?
In the Rust belt we refer to joe Biden as China joe. He sold out the American people in favor of China. He’s one of the main reasons there is a rust belt.  Joe Biden would sell us out again, surrendering to China to enrich himself and his globalist allies.
My favorite is how Joe Biden and Tim Ryan were on a kick for a minute a few weeks ago about "healing the nation."
Trump can’t run on his record of failures, so he’s doing what he always does: lie.
What policies has Joe Biden written Or Co sponsored that you agree with? He’s been in office for over 45 years, surely you can find a couple?
The closest comparison to Biden would be Ronald Regan, who Unbeknownst to everyone suffered from Alzheimer’s when he was in office. However he Wasn’t nearly as far gone as Biden is. Binden constitutes a major security Risk and should be replaced.
I really thought Joe Biden would be dead by now.
Too much bothers me about Biden to support him. I think they left needs to be honest and ditch him for someone who isn’t in decline. Like just let Kamala or Bernie run.
Agree. Biden is brain dead politically on fracking. Turns out people don’t ❤️ radioactive waste.
Clinton won Washington by 16 points, Obama won by 17 points in 2008. This poll shows a 34% lead for Biden
We kept protesting, but our group was religious-based. Since Biden became the DNC selection, I’ve been reconnecting with the peace &amp; justice issues that radicalized me in the first place.
I’m sorry to say that Most Americans are completely ignorant about what’s going on the Middle East. They don’t realize or care that joe Biden, would simply throw money at these terrorists groups, to keep them away from American interests, Not caring about the countless lives lost
We will in November. President Biden will make it better.
Biden supporters are always so bitter ! What’s it feel like to have to support a man that is the antithesis of everything you believe in?
Hey even that’s better than women who have dicks or maybe 8 year old girls like Biden prefers.🤷‍♂️
Biden is so old he has slept through this pandemic he thinks everybody has a bad cold the old fart will probably die in office
I wish Biden was radical left! 😂 He’s as moderate as they come, Jezebel.
Like I said I can work the political lines better than anyone. Ur back in!!! Biden's adopted new dog - and other political pets
Actually Iran,China, and Russia are all big fans of Biden. They like his weakness. Especially Iran, who thinks Biden is going to be like Obama and just throw money at them to keep them away from American interests.
Ohio is definitely going for trump. Everywhere I look I see trump signs and bumper stickers. Not a Biden sign in sight.
I just cannot see people for fled Cuba voting for Biden. Especially with all that’s been going on. They see the signs they know what’s up.
They are disaffected democrats, people in middle America who got royally fucked Over by by Obama -Biden’s Rein of terror.
We're 100 days out and you still can't answer what Biden has shown that has changed your mind.
Until Joe Biden beats Joe Biden this December.  Lmao.
I am certainly bailing if Biden wins. I haven’t reopened my business, I’m waiting to see what’s going to happen. Most people I know have a plan B country just in case he does win, no one wants to live in a communist hellhole. There is a reason China and Iran are supporting Biden
Why do you hate America? Why do you want America to meet the same fate as Venezuela or the Soviet Union? Do you dislike freedom, safety, and comfort? If Biden wins anyone with the means and any amount of common sense is going to leave the country!
Like what? His list is far less damning then joe Biden’s “all black people are super predators” Or “poor kids are just as smart as white kids”
3) the first step act, which was his criminal justice reform bill. It undid a lot of the damage that joe Biden’s 1994 crime bill caused. It reformed criminal sentencing guidelines, and decreased the federal inmate population by allowing for time off sentences for good behavior.
Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Both sides support black lives, in fact president trump has done more for the black community then Obama-Biden ever did ! As for BLM .. sorry your just a bunch of mostly white kids out for a good time ! I used to call you guys sheep but I think zombie horde is more fitting !
If  knows how to fix America, why didn't he tell obammy?  Lmao.  Joe biden is gonna beat Joe biden in December.   He says the government has failed you, while being in the government over 40 years.   The guy is a joke.  BIGGEST IDIOT DEMOCRATS  EVER  NOMINATED..... Biden
I don’t think it’s a tactic A lot of people actually feel like Biden would turn America into nazi Germany though or something equally bad.
newest plan bolsters Medicaid, provides relief for child care services, and gives educators and caregivers the benefits they deserve.  I’m proud to be part of the team that stands up for our caregivers and teachers, #TeamJoe.
Play ball! Biden two to one ! #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica2020
Would STILL love to know that Biden has shown you recently that has changed your mind.
Obama and Biden were terrible for anyone except the very poor, or very wealthy. The middle class ended up completely broken thanks to OBAMACARE!  they lost their full time jobs, had to pay fines for not being able to afford private insurance.
I live in The Youngstown, Ohio area and all I see are trump signs and flags. Not a Biden sign to be seen . It’s not surprising though, the democrats gave up on Ohio. We are no longer a “battleground state” obviously Dems know Ohio is now a lost cause for them.
No reason to vote for Joe Biden. Period.
Excuse me but Trump may need to take it again! Biden has already proven himself he can speak in full sentences and has a much bigger vocabulary.Agree, they exploit that tragedy while ignoring the daily violence and corruption of trump inc. We have other great choices so we don't have to deal with this, IMHO. I still hope she gets a high post in the Biden administration.
Delusional Republicans are so funny. Cut to January 20, 2021, "Knock knock (Whitehouse front door) Donald...?" No answer. That's because #BlueWave2020 did make America great again and booted your ass out the door! Door opens, "Hello President Biden"
Biden's higher in the polls, but this seems like a party lines election. Both sides don't want to concede power and both sides don't like who's representing them (in general).
Biden does NOT instill that confidence
What do y’all make of Trump actively sewing doubts about the outcome of the election? Does it push you any closer to voting for Biden? 👂🏾👀👂🏾
You can't be a Republican and vote for Biden.... You are a closet socialist... Use the right label dips##t.........
If Biden and the Democrats steals the election, we will be screwed for the rest of our lives. Have a great afternoon 🌹
..saying that riots are peaceful protests, Obama and Biden aren't corrupt and so many lies I can't keep track. Can we just Impeach all the Democrats? Amazing that sitting members of Congress can openly support racist hate groups like BLM, I guess they can support the KKK as well?
The difference is Biden has people around him whom he trusts to not poison his tapioca pudding and to bring him papers  to sign if he can stop drooling for a minute. Trump only has Ivanka, and the time will come he starts confusing Ivanka for Ivana and being mad about the divorce
This is why I believe that Jill Biden had a hand in Neilia Biden’s death to turn Joe Biden to the deep state.
How about Trump, Biden, 3 moderators and no audience, all 6 feet apart with masks. Right? Right
Yeah but the really blew a chance to have the eagle towing a banner that says "Biden 2020"
Obama never really had to worry about that with Biden.  And Hillary was out of the administration for the 2nd term.
i love that liberals call conservatives "single issue voters" when their single issue is "beating  while not giving anything that they think Biden can do better.
Wait until Biden gets in, poor kid will quit.
There is no Islamaphobia Joe Biden, people want to worship their own religion in this country, we don’t want a specific religion stuffed down our throats.
The Republicans ruin the economy and the Democrats fix the mess they left. Obama cleaned up Bush’s and now Biden will clean up Trump’s if he wins the upcoming election. If we get four more years of Trump this country will be unrecognizable.
I guess a year ago, President Trump talked with the President of Ukraine about massive corruption, which was possible linked to the Obama Administration (at least according to Joe Biden who admitted to blackmailing the previous President). That somehow led to President Trump.....
Does anyone wonder why Biden is leading the Polls? Trump voter's will bash Trump to not destroy their personal lives, and only support him when it really matters. Say you support Biden, no one cares, support Trump, you may be murdered. Silent Majority for a reason.
Lol Intolerable. Good One. #Trump2020 because America won’t survive under Biden, it’ll be sold out from Americans by Biden just like Obama did.
And they know that Trump will lose his re-election.., they are scared because they know he's hated and that he's behind Biden in the polls in Texas.,Florida.,Pennsylvania.,should I name more States?  Even Fox News and Senate Republicans know that Trump is in trouble.
Maybe let's not tell the super trumpies that today.   One of the basic guardrails of pluralistic society is the thought that what goes around comes around. So what President Trump does today to Antifa President Biden could do next year to anti-mask
We should vote for Biden. Masks required at all times, no Police, no Laws; awesome, I was thinking about becoming a Serial Killer and this will make it alot easier. I'll wear a BLM shirt and just kill White people, I'll be a freaking hero.  Vote Biden, vote stupid.  #Trump2020Biden could go to the nursing home and Obama could run the country. Problem solved. Next?
Would you vote for a Biden-Obama ticket?
The economy shrank the biggest it’s ever done in history, jobless claims continue to be on the rise, but you continue your false attacks on  and law enforcement. Here’s the truth: Trump tried to repeated cut federal funding for law enforcement. Biden would increase.
Intel Dems press Nunes for details on anti-Biden package from Ukrainian official  via

Nothing is going to keep us from casting our ballots, I'd walk across fire to get my vote in for Biden #WeWillVote
Great man I'm riding for Biden because I never did trust a jack ass to ride
Biden is going to f*** you just like all the Democrats before him did
Joe Biden should get in line
I envy Michigan. Ohio is bombarded with  end of the world ads on a daily basis. And too close to KY so we see  even darker view of the future. #voteBlue
You didn’t even read Biden’s plan. If you did, you’d realize what utter nonsense you just said.
Look, I really prefer  pick  but no, I don’t believe  has been given advance notice but instead was canning drafts in anticipation. Biden’s notes today was likely in anticipation of questions about the Dodd/Politico story. Everyone chill out.
There is no question that it helps and has helped thousands of people. Sadly it doesn’t fit the leftist agenda. They need people afraid to keep the schools closed to ensure the big Pharma can make billions on a questionable vaccine and for Biden to get elected.
This, frankly, is something Obama never took seriously enough and it cost the party. Biden gets it.
While I hope you are right, after listening to Barr today say repeatedly that both Obama and Biden illegally spied on Trump, I can’t agree. An indictment only requires a grand jury to believe there is probable cause, unlike the proof required at a trial.
Barr is going to indict both Obama and Biden before the election. Not even hiding it. Barr and Jordan said it multiple times today that Obama and Barr illegally spyed on Trump.  Charges won’t hold but could have a serious impact on the election.
It appears they intend to indict both Obama and Biden, and others, just before the election. Just listen to Barr and Jordan. They are both saying what  they plan on doing.
Wrong again. Zero carbon by 2050 was both Sanders and Biden’s plans:
Every thinking person who doesn’t get their information from hotheads on social media but read the source material can tell the task forces largely wrote the platform, including a carbon neutral goal by 2050, which is literally something Sanders and Biden both ran on.
You realize they weren’t Sanders task forces at all but Biden-Sanders joint task forces. This is getting embarassing for you.
Unlike you, I have:
Don’t even go there. Joe Biden WILL NOT BECAUSE HE CANNOT. He’s a dementia patient
When Biden is president we can sleep at night knowing we are in good hands.
They apparently were able to process the primary back in March where they voted for Biden in a 23 point margin.
Biden won her district by twenty-three points in the March 10th primary.
Bet you lunch Trump won’t show or debate. He will demand conditions that will defeat the purpose of a debate; but in reality he knows he will look like an idiot next to Biden.
They’re holding nothing hostage. Unless they start getting close to all of Sanders delegates plus 47% of the Biden, the platform is going to easily pass despite their threat. This is the dumbest tactic possible.
But Biden IS a full on pedo, so...it makes sense. #ThesePeopleAreSick  #MAGA #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #EvilLeftHandPathDems #RacistDems #FascistDems #DemsHateAmerica #AntifaIsAnAstroturfFoundation #BlackLivesMatterIsAnAstroturfFoundation #GeorgeSorosIsTheAntichrist #RacistBLM
I did the math. They only need to pick up roughly 47% of Biden’s pledged delegates to threaten the platform’s passage.
Also ignores fact that Biden and Sanders ALREADY worked out a compromise on the health care platform with a joint task force.  So they’re basically threatening to reject their own bargain which actually only makes them look bad and disorganized. This is such dumb politics.
I can’t believe they are trying to call this a rebellion like it’s going somewhere. If they couldn’t do this with the platform with nearly 40% of the delegates, why would they think they can with &gt; 25%? Biden and Sanders already worked out a compromise on health care platform.
It should be noted the platform needs a simple majority of all delegates (not just pledged) of which Biden likely has over 72% and Sanders under 25%. So this is empty symbolic posturing.
REALITY CHECK: The platform needs a simple majority to pass and Sanders has less than 25% of all delegates and Biden has over 72%. This is pointless.
This was his post convention bounce. He wasn’t leading for an entire year like Biden has. I get the notion of not getting complacent but let’s be honest too.
To give you a sense how much NBC’s NC poll may either be an outlier or a sign of a worsening environment for GOP, the RCP average has been half the lead it shows Biden. Also Ohio is incredibly competitive.
Biden or not Congratulations on your sobriety
I can’t get specific, but if you want to know what Biden is going to say just ask AOC and comrade Bernie. Can’t wait for the debates.
What has Biden did for this country in 50 years other than making his family and himself  rich
Ready for President Joe Biden
So if the Biden campaign has no enthusiasm, wouldn’t HE have the silent majority?
Change?? Obama was the one that wanted to transform America! Pathetic go ahead hare Trump and vote for Biden not going to work!
Second poll out today showing Biden beginning to get a sizeable lead in AZ and FL. If Trump is truly behind in FL, then that’s pretty much the ballgame.
Trump supporters have never been silent, nor a majority. Joe Biden literally has the support of the majority of Americans.
It takes some amazing misinformation campaign for someone to begin to think Biden, not Trump, is worse than Nixon.
Biden has like 2 functioning brain cells and you want him
Biden is on the record numerous times saying exactly this.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is it just me but I haven’t heard why Joe Biden is campaigning from his basement ? Maybe we could get him a tree stand
ICYMI: Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
What damage has he done? Do you not read the news? Racist? Your Senator Byrd was an actual member of KKK and Biden and Hillary adored him. No Republicans promote the killing of anyone like the F Party does. But babies in the womb aren’t human right?
Biden will pick some crazy left wing socialist if he picks a black person it will be racist choice why not pick a Spanish or Asian American in my opinion why not pick the best man or woman for the job
Why does Our Revolution or any of the groups think they have any leverage here? Biden has literally nearly three quarters of the entire convention delegates sewn up. Whomever he names is likely to be approved by acclamation.  It’s like they want a pretext to create division.
President of The United States of America Joe Biden
Who says that Biden is gonna be the winner?
Yep, You win. Pick any prize from the second row- can’t wait for Biden to take the test- I bet you can’t either
I’m a betting man, Biden will not show up or have an excuse. He will not debate Donald Trump. Dummy
yet you do be canceling the homeslice Biden a heck of a lot
Won’t you be surprised when you wake up to see Biden won by a smidge and another hanging chad type BS .   The devious Dems are gonna rig it.   There is no way the REPUBLICRAT SWAMP is going to have another 4 years of Trump.  Btw, why would you trust our govt to keep them secure?
Hey Nester Joe Biden can’t run the country from his basement with people controlling what he says. Dummy
Oh no a landslide would be too obvious.   They’ll make Biden win by just a tiny bit, just a few votes.   This will make it seem legit!   So sad what’s about to happen to this great country after Trump 😢
Of course they are.   This election WILL BE RIGGED.   Does anyone actually believe they are going to accept the election results of “we the people “ considering their behavior for the past 4 years?!   Get real!!  It’ll be Biden by a smidge 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️😤
I’d rather have Biden over trump even tho he’s still senile
Biden has to bring in Obama to speak for him
That is exactly who they are! These are radical communists, anarchists America hating... Biden owns them
Democrats: Packets sent to Trump allies are part of foreign plot to damage Biden
Bro did he say this is Joe Biden’s America and then post Trump’s hectic America? 😂😂
Went to Ft. Hamilton for bloodwork this morning. The girl taking my blood started complaining about how much she has been working the past few months. She then goes on to insinuate that COVID-19 is a media hoax to get Biden elected.  Yeah - bright one there!
Obama the worst President in history shouldn’t be giving advice to anyone and Biden couldn’t put together a 6 piece puzzle for a 2 year old
If Biden is elected he and OAC want to do away with gas cars and planes so you might want to add horses to your listWe are. That's why we're electing Joe Biden.
Save your ad money for golf lessons. It’s Biden by a landslide this November!
The hacks led to bogus tweets being sent out July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk
I dont honestly care. Im going to bote for Biden no matter who he picks.
You're supporting criminals in office, you're supporting this murdering snake, the right are more ignorant than Biden Bros
We love you I pray that the new president Biden has you by his side you deserve to be there
It will be a rigged election this year to favor biden
Biden is Trump 2.0
Biden sucks. The Democrats suck. Vote Green.
Lol what about Medicare for All? This is why many people are voting third this year, your loss is upon yourselves, either replace Biden with Bernie or lose this year.
Even if Trump or Biden wins, remember, progressives and Socialists are taking over Congress!
Voting Green. Joe Biden is a lying bastard.
Democrats: we need to appeal to former Trump supporters and leftists  Biden: I'd appeal to former Republicans and Libertarians but not support leftist morales  Democrats:
Dont worry. Most of us plan to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to vote for Joe Biden.
Fuck Biden.   Howie 2020
if y’all vote for biden, i hope y’all know he touches children. fucking idiots
Can Mushy Brained Biden pass the test? He won't even take questions from reporters, even CNN's softballs. Uncle Joe isn't playing with a full deck.Stable?? You think Biden has any sane thoughts or educated ideas for our country. He’s a puppet.
Well you would never have to worry about that with Biden. He could not even find his phone or have a complete thought to tweet. The President keeps us informed, we can’t count on media for fair reporting. Get over it!
Joe Biden has a lot of experience. No thanks.
Wow.. Joe Biden and Washington Post commenting on "pandemic readiness" back in October. Total coincidence.. nothing to see here.. move along.. wear your mask...

With Joe Biden trying to garner the black vote by picking a black woman for v. p., don’t they understand that party affiliations are a mind set and not a gender or skin color?
I don't want to pick a fight. Really. But if you is won't vote for Biden, no matter how flawed, trump could win. Then we won't be the United States of America anymore
MTV needs to make a new Real World/Jersey Shore but a White House addition starring Donald Trump, Dr Fauci, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden. 4 geezers, 1 house. I’d say throw in Hilary Clinton too but then we’d eventually have a murder mystery show #trump #biden #pelosi #fauci #mtv
I just realized how the electoral outlook could get even better for Biden, and it scares the 💩 out of me.
Biden 🇱🇷 get this country back
most all of their ads are filled with lies....biden over and over has repeatedly said he is NOT for defunding the police....but trumps ads all claim he is.  And so forth...if theres a way to cheat trump will find it i promise you and already has
YEAH, BABY! VOTE BIDEN!

Agree to disagree. Biden is neither, plus he has dementia. Good luck with that.
So it ok for you to judge joe Biden though.  Got it.  Your logic is so solid, how could I argue with that?  Almost as logical as you saying “he died for my sins” right next to “we are all born with sin”.  I’m confused 🤷🏼‍♀️
Biden will never make it. If he does by accident this country will go down hill economically so fast, your head will never stop spinning!
I saw the advertising for the Obama Biden campaign ad, I wonder where Obama’s wedding ring is??
Joe Biden is an embarrassment. He will be your weekend at  Bernies democrat.
Biden is not dividing the party...the party is doing that all on it’s own. The  doesn’t care what 88% of their voters want as they’re too busy kissing corporate asses. He needs the party to get him on the ballot. Once he’s in then .....🤔
I just saw one of Trump’s lying &amp; sickeningly deceptive political commercials saying “we won’t be safe in Biden’s America”. 🤮
Kinda finished. Joe Biden is prone to gaffes so keep pushing like he’s down.
Look at when he band travel from China. Joe Biden called him a xenophobe.  Trump from the beginning said Hydroxychloroquine was very promising for preventing/treating Covid Turns out it doubles your survival chances and almost guarantees that you don’t catch it to begin with
Anyone who says Joe Biden is the leader we need right now is delusional. He’s just the best option we have at getting a literal dumpster fire out of the White House.
B O and Joe Biden can team up to make a campaign ad but both remain silent on their party’s attempt to utterly destroy this nation.  If I remember correctly, that was B O’s plan for America while in office, he is the author of this destruction.

what crusade?  Conservatives can only lie about everything.  I am Catholic and I fully support Joe Biden and fully condemn the REAL sinners and religious hypocrits ....conservatives.
calm...he told us nothing other than what he told us yesterday....that he's switching sides.   He's jumping from the Trump side he's been on the past 4 months, to the Biden side he should of been on the past 4 months.
just waiting for the Biden Obama video rollout...
Well, what I remember was what a shambles the party was in after Romney lost.  And then along came a carnival barker. So, my answer would be no. It will be interesting to see what kind of party they assemble after Biden's landslide victory.If he was not running for President this might be funny, but more so tragic as obviously Joe Biden needs help and I hope he gets it. The last place though he needs to be is in the oval office behind the desk.
Uhhhh Biden is not the president yet.  The current one should *actually* do his fucking job... and sending in “shock troops” ain’t it.
Well I guess you were wrong with this one, huh? Seems as though you owe Joe Biden a big apology.
Okay Ryan. Here's how it works.  FIRST you get Biden and the DNC back in a position where the can actually DO something, and THEN you make them listen.

As the party invites Republicans to our convention, rejects Medicare for All, rejects cannabis legalization, and inches toward nominating a cop as our VP, the memes about how we're all trash if we don't support Biden are coming full steam. #Gaslighting
Anyone who follows politics knows that independent voters usually decide elections. Those voters, I’m certain, are watching Biden’s strange behavior and wondering “what the hell?”

I’m sure the Biden’s will appreciate your efforts
Vote for Joe Biden!
This really necessary?  At this point if you are voting for Trump, you are going to vote for him no matter what he says/does.  Like he said he could stand on 5th ave and shoot someone and not lose voters.  Don’t see how this helps Biden.
They should seek Dr Biden’s input since she will be the one overseeing the project’s completion.

THOSE PEOPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA ARE SMART THEY KNOW WHAT PROCESS IS. THEY KNOW ELECTING BIDEN MEANS SLOW ECONOMY IF ELECTED FACT.

Joe Biden is the only one who has had a dementia test. He failed.
So Joe biden saying "I don't want my kids growing up in a racial jungle" when trying to get segregation to stay in schools is better?😂 Absolute hypocrisy in everything you say. Better do some fact checking on what bullshit spews from your mouth.
I get it,loyalty to the party and fighting for the working class but Joe Biden isn’t really for that. He is a corporate politician who isn’t going to fight for anything,everything is going to stay the same. He doesn’t even think we free healthcare in a pandemic🤷🏾‍♂️
Joe Biden set the stage for what we have now and plans to do nothing to change it. The author of the crime bill made way for the police state and Biden said he will do nothing to fix it. He still wants Marijuana to be illegal and isn’t in favor of defunding police🤷🏾‍♂️If biden picks Michelle obama say goodbye to America.!! So scary!! She wants it destroyed! I pray he dont pick her🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💋♥️🙏
More likley than not on the New Island, hiding out with Hunter Biden.
Another ridiculous and idiotic statement of the day. Trump knew from day one that he isn't going to beat Joe Biden iNovember. He even suggested to delay the election, fear mongering tactics.
Nobody does better work for Republicans than liberals, lol. I see more anti Biden shit from Dems than I ever do from Repubs. Do you guys not understand why we lost last time? How daft.
Political hack! Keep the lies alive about Biden.
I truly can’t trust anyone that thinks Joe Biden is a better candidate for president over Trump. Ignorance is bliss.
Purely interested: where do you stand on the idea of Harris being Biden’s VP pick? I personally think she’s the best choice.
Never has there been so much interest in the VP. It’s a decision made primarily by the DNC to attract the most voters considering various demographics. Obama probably didn’t even know Biden. You think McCain chose idiot newcomer Sarah Palin?
Joe Biden Airs Ad That Vows To End Muslim Ban That Doesn't Exist On DAY ONE  via

Who ever is the VP pick is the candidate... Biden can't string 10 words together any more ... They have to keep him quiet... He can only ruin his chances of he does much talking ...
No. But all racists might be republicans.  I assume the many ex-republicans now swearing to vote for Joe Biden are not, imo so it kind of holds that not all are racist.
supporting Biden? He's Senile and a Racist!
Biden is nothing more than a Liar and a Racist! and he's Senile too!
yes, she’s incredibly critical of Biden (rightfully so) — however seeing as he is now the Dem nominee, her argument for how people who refused to vote for Hillary cost us the election still applies. It’s wildly fascinating!!
Don’t be so hard on Moscow Mitch aka 3 Martini Mitch. We know he has no courage to be a man and takes his marching orders from Trump, who takes his orders from Putin. VOTE BIDEN AND AMY.
everyone should be reading  new book — ESPECIALLY if you’re a Dem who says they can’t/won’t vote for Biden   if you think that we aren’t setting ourselves up for a tr*mp 2020 victory right now — BOY DO I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU   a 2020 must read.
Keep trying Kamala. You already let America know you’re a racist. Two racist running together. How stupid do you think the USA is?  Kamala: his evidence to free black men. Free labor she said.  Biden: white kids going to school with black kids would create a racial jungle
I think we should start demanding to be polled and not the same 1,100-1,500 for these imaginary polls that say Biden is winning in the polls nonsense.  Biden couldn’t beat himself out of a wet paper bag let along best  in a debate or voting.  #VoteTrumpToSaveAmerica

Stupid ? Not so sure as they prevented Barr from responding . This is what they intended for their edited clips for Biden's campaign ! The Russians call using a truth to create a lie ; " True Lies " !
Because she won't be running in 2024, at least imo, because Biden probably runs for re-election.
#BetterThanTrump I may have problems with Biden, especially as a Democratic Republican, but we're desperate. Almost anyone is better than Trump. And anything against Biden right now, is Pro Trump.
Please Please if it’s true that 2 old white dinosaurs Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd have the power to pick or scuttle a VP pick for Biden, it will 100% have a very negative effect on me. If people could hear from u what is really going on, it will calm a lot of nerves
What day is Biden announcing his VP pick so I can be sure to avoid this hell hole? I hope it’s not Harris or Warren...be mad🤷🏾‍♀️
Wow! It takes a lot of nerve to call out Joe Biden for nepotism when your very own 'Dear Leader' has taken nepotism to a whole new level. #TrumpGOPDerelictionOfDuty
Are you a bot, or just a progressive who doesn't know the meaning of the word relative to our situation? Anything but Biden (and with the EC, it's gonna be one or the other, we can't change that at this point) is regressive and dangerous - literally dire - for everyone you know.
I agree with your analysis of this. I believe Biden will choose an African American woman and I think it will be Harris. Whoever it is will be slimed mercilessly by Right &amp; Left. Media dying to sink their fangs into a Dem. Joe seems like Teflon. VP choice will be target.

Are Joe Biden's Zoom calls using deep fakes? Why does every one of his Zoom calls look choppy and have terrible resolution? He's running for potus, can't they afford high speed internet? I think they are using open source AI tools.

Trump vs Biden Is actually  Irrational vs rational
I am not sure how humane Biden is, as he vigorously supported the bill that gave us mass incarceration. Regardless, Trump must go but it is completely acceptable for citizens to expect more from their leaders
What would Biden done differently
The pandemic,the economy,the unemployment,the racial unrest caused by the lawless police. Eight months of disaster under Donald Trump’s watch.  And these MAGA mutants are talking about the legitimacy of a Joe Biden…

Lol choosing trump over Biden is common sense
If you think Trump is a Builder and winner, you are sadly mistaken. He is none of these. If you think Trump is a great leader he us not. He can’t get us out of this mess. He is not competent to lead us. He will lose the election because Biden is abetter man than Trump and stable.
Yes. Biden 2020. Gang of 5. Won’t get my vote ever until real apologies and payment to the city of their laughable defense money.
You have no knowing if you are going to stay as president. That is not up to you. It’s not looking too good for you regarding the opinion polls. You’re lack of leadership will destroy you in November. America needs a winner like Joe Biden not a whiner like you.
Just saw a page on Twitter for an organization calling itself "Young Believers for Biden". A "Christian" Leftist group who apparently support infanticide, Socialism, and Cultural Marxism, as well as a host of other contradictory and evil positions. Disgusting.

Biden will just make things worse. Civil unrest started again and was with it highest point in the past 20 years when Obama was in office.
Joe Biden is not a guy that needs to be sitting in the oval office. He’s a geezer who needs a rocking chair. We need to show compassion for the Joe without letting him run for President.

Trump is exponentially more capable than Joe Biden. Biden has dementia, and doesn’t even know what planet he’s on.
Orange man is trying to do all he can to bring frustration, misinformation, and lies to the American people, because he sees a Biden  landslide in November!  We need to move the election up and put him out of his misery!

Biden didn't say that. I guarantee that if you find ANY sound bite, it is edited. BIDEN HAS NEVER CALLED TO DEFUND THE POLICE! Stop drinking the cool-aid. I usually agree with you about lots of subjects, but this time you're wrong.

They brought him back with a certain medication that got some doctors in hot water. Now, at least we know that Biden has an out.
When did Biden say that bro? Get the quote!
Yeah, and honestly, I don't think there is much of an appetite for that anywhere outside the White House.  We will vote in November and Joe Biden will take over January 20.  The rest is a lot of (interesting but improbable) sound and fury signifying nothing.
Not for this corrupt dolt. Not while I'm still breathing and can do anything about it! Look, if it's close (not the scenario anticipated) we could have another Bush v. Gore and SCOTUS could side with Trump. But that's not the same as SCOTUS ruling for Biden and military mutinying
Joe Biden "Write ZOOM Z Double O M Box 350 Boston Mass. O 2 1 3 4!"
I sure hope so, the left is out of control.  Biden doesnt even know what day he's in let alone location. He never swings his arms when he walks. He needs to be in physical therapy not running for President
2 takeaways from this.   The hoes on the view are seriously fugly , and Biden never completed a single thought in the two minutes given to him.

but if it does not. Then Pelosi is president. Im not a huge fan of her or biden but they are better than trump lol
This is the shit that shows that the vast majority of leftist are on the lower side of the intelligence bell curve...but yet it is still an accurate campaign! “Settling for Biden” is exactly what they have to do. Hold thier noses and swallow this snake oil!
There’s probably times he actually thinks he is a tomato can. I’m not a Biden supporter at all, but it’s sad to see what he has become. He doesn’t know where he is half the time and he can’t put a coherent sentence together. Someone close to him needs to get him some help.
*paid for by Joe Biden for President*
When we consider getting rid of the filibuster, it’s good to remember we’re not just getting rid of it for a Biden era Congress, but also for a President Trump Jr. or a President Tucker Carlson era Congress.
If he does and Pelosi is still SOTH, she becomes the interim POTUS until the election is held. I'm hoping he postpones it. That defeat to himbwould be greater than losing to Biden
Michelle is.  Pretty much the only thing that excuses Biden's delaying announcing his VP choice is if Michelle just hasn't gotten back to him yet.
Honestly, let 45 try to stay in the White House. We might get a President Pelosi, which idk... I kinda like the idea of that better than Biden 🤷🏻‍♀️

Feinstein is oldest, but Leahy is longest serving. But to be clear as even Alan Dershowitz points out: the Dems could select anyone, including Harris, Warren or Sanders. So if Harris (or Duckworth or Baldwin) were Biden's announced running mate, I'd guess it would be that woman.
George, I respect you immensely, but you’re grossly naive if you think Biden will retain the pseudo centrism of his primary campaign. He’s seen the energy, the sheer anger and forcefulness of the hard Progressive Left, and he’s cowed by it. God help us if Dems win the Senate.
Why are they all using Biden’s campaign slogan?!?
Clinton, like Biden, is a leacherous, creepy person. Prove me wrong! I’ll wait.
I’m guessing that Biden would probably feel a little disrespected by being called a tomato can.
JOE BIDEN,a true leader 🙂
Hey remember back in April when  Biden said you would do this? Good luck traitor.
What an out of touch dummy. You’d have thought she’d learn her lesson when the internet torched her for being a giant MeToo hypocrite when she said they we didn’t need to necessarily believe the woman that said Joe Biden assaulted her. Ghoulish.
Fuck no.  Fuck. No.  Im casting my vote for Biden against you, and if you want to try and delay the election to extend your illegitimate presidency wrongly. I hope to god that you feel the full force and wrath of the American Military, well armed Militias, and the American people
demented Joe doesn't know the Bible from right-side up or down.  I've seen the pictures.  Does he even know where he is today?  He won't debate Trump.  He is...."Joe Biden, husband of Joe Biden"
I'd say pushing 60. Biden's going to inflate Clinton's CA margin by a good amount.
You support biden, no wonder.
Only if Biden wins. If Trump wins, you know the Demorats will keep the virus scam going until January 2025!
Our country is on the brink of being destroyed if Biden becomes president. Has anyone told  that he himself is going to lose this election with his pathetic not thought out tweets? Biden can’t win it without  losing it for him. Take his damn twitter account away!
It's probably a deep fake they've been training for the past year. Since there is no way he's fit to debate  I predict Biden's team will try to do the debates remotely so that Obama can debate him using a deep fake.
Tulare. With uniform shift, it was the closest on one of my maps to go for Biden (46%D)
or claim the clintons obama or biden offed him
Remember,  predicted Trump would do this and the Trump campaign called Biden "off his rocker", in response. Seems that Biden understands a petty autocrat like Trump better than Trump's own campaign does.
Everyone is slating Biden to pass in the next 8 yrs and idk how I feel about that 🙃
Even if this date is cherry picked, just look at the graphs. Trump's highest point isn't as high as Biden's lowest. Whereas he was often leading, tied, or within a couple of points of Clinton.
This article has the link to the congressional hearing.
Shit- I loved Scooby Doo but if you think George Carlin would have voted for Biden, you’re out of your fucking mind.
There was a large contingent of people that were predicting this. However, Biden was probably the only 1 blatantly lying about marching in South Africa in support of Mandela and supporting/participating in the Civil rights movement
Biden wouldn’t make another 3 months
K but hear me out...instead of delaying the election (which he can’t do) why don’t we just vote today? I vote for Biden. Anyone else? (This is Twitter so he might actually think it’s official)
I'm confused. I asked you for a link to the video you said showed Biden admitting he misused his position, and you sent me a meme created by the opposing party with misleading facts.
I wonder how long it'll be until the GOP and the Right find a way to blame Cain's death on wearing masks, the protests, or Biden specifically. Maybe a combination of the three.   Any death is bad, I'm not happy about his passing, but I do hope that some good can come of it.
As usual, you’re wrong.  I’m voting for Biden because I know he will not be vindictive or ill willed.  Frankly, I wish for you a long and healthy career out of public office.  Via Con Dios
Maybe, but in the Presidential election (or is it a selection?) between Trump vs Biden, imo we the people really have a choice between poison a or poison b. So delaying the election does not matter all that much, but it gives the media something to talk about, as Trump knows.
"Trailing badly in the polls, the president baselessly suggested the Nov election would be 'the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT' in history."  'Sen McConnell of KY did not answer questions about Trump’s tweet as he walked onto the Senate floor Thurs morning.'
I find it rediculous that anyone is saying this. I submit taking some time to read Biden’s position papers to understand what he wants to do when elected. I don’t believe this is a “anyone but Trump” election. I truly believe Biden is the best choice
We can’t sleep until Biden is sworn in January 2021.  Never underestimate trump’s criminality.
Biden, the safety school of presidents
Biden on air in Ohio.   Sitting Speaker indicted.   Vote coming on his removal.   And it’s only 10 am.
Scenario 1 puts it in the hands of Congress, which would give Trump a legitimate election victory anyway.  A worse scenario would be a 2000 Florida repeat, except DeSantis refuses to appoint electors for Biden, and Congress gives the victory to Trump.
In all seriousness though, couldn't the Dems pick anyone better than Biden?

I heard you criticized Joe Biden because he thought Trump would try and postpone the election. guess you owe Biden and all Americans an apology.
Am I voting for Biden?  Let's see - if Trump simply didnt run and another Republican ran instead and won. But simply wasn't a literal Neo-Nazi with 25+ Sexual assault claims against them I'd still see that as a win.  So yes. I will vote for a Corporate Dem over literal Neo-Nazis.
How can anyone think Biden can run a country???? WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! They are using and manipulating you!

Right, I get having issues with her record (I have a lot of issues), but worried that if she’s VP she’s gonna want to be President? What do they think she’s gonna do, kill Biden to hasten her ascent?
Public polling (average) has Biden ahead in Ohio.   2016-2019 election results show massive movement in formerly GOP suburbs that puts Ohio in play...so the tied polling isn’t a surprise.   2020 primary marked first time since 2008 where more Dems voted in primary than GOP.
Nothing in SW Ohio? It’s weird seeing more Biden signs on my road than Trump signs (which are more like shrines)

Not sure if it’s part of national ad buys but I have been getting Biden ads in Cincy/Dayton area on tv and SAT Radio
Joe Biden Cons:  Won't abolish ICE  Won't abolish the DHS No legal weed (wtf???) No M4A No wealth tax No student debt forgiveness  Will "arrest violent protesters" Loves fracking  No GND Won't end qualified immunity  Pros: Won't fuck up a pandemic  RBG seat  Not much good here.
Great to see Biden ad spending starting up in Ohio today.  Ohio is tied and clearly winnable.   Our grassroots army is fired up, our downticket slate is strong, and the GOP just got caught in the largest bribery scandal in history.   But gotta fight fire w fire on the airwaves.
WTF TOO AMBITIOUS???? If she were a white man they wouldn't give it a thought. The Biden "allies" need to get the f*ck out of the way.

Biden’s base is almost exclusively Never Trumpers and the ‘Vote Blue To Matter Who’ folks. Little do these people realize that Biden isn’t as hellbent about defeating Trump as they are. If he was, he would support wildly popular, no-brainer policies like M4A and legalizing weed.
Pffff I fucking WISH Joe Biden would be our trojan horse. He won't be. He is more likely to literally just sleep through his four years.
'Way back in  the early 70's at the height of riots and white flight.  Biden grew up...too bad your arguments haven't.

This reminds me of the Angela Davis thing and that made me so mad because literally the Biden people and the leftists both had bad takes and I was not prepared for that.
This is extremely misleading. In the interview in question, she specifically mentions delivering Michigan to Joe Biden. She’s probably going to endorse him at some point.
Please forward me link of you asking on air or tweeting why Hunter Biden was able to get Burisma job “with NO expertise in the business.”
It may be messy, but on January 20 he will no longer be POTUS.  Even if still disputed in the Courts,  would become POTUS.  Likely, tho, Biden would have been certified by state electors. Either way, new POTUS would command all federal forces. We start anew.
Why did you drop out of the race? Biden is sun-downing. You were beating him.
It is! Really about all of the women Biden is considering but mainly KH. It’s like 2016 all over again. It’s so infuriating
IF he wins (and let’s not assume he will   because 2016), he will be a one-and-done President. Biden is selecting the 2024 Democrat nominee.
Great work on MSNBC! I wish they would show one video of them asking a Democrat if they were getting paid by the Biden Campaign! But to be fair, everyone knows it’s true name is MSDNC and they are openly partisan. I think they have thier own Partisan Parade, they are so open!
Like Antifa is a “myth” 🤣🤣🤣.. him and Biden should take naps together! Real great job Nadler lmao.

Same here.  My loyalty to this country has evaporated.  Even if (when) Biden is elected, about a third of the people living in the U.S. hold beliefs I cannot live with.
Your Country? It quit being "your country" when you decided to support people like Biden. People who have NO conscious, aren't pro life, who want to indoctrinate our children with FALSE facts, &amp; took God out of schools. I will make the best choice for MY country. TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸✌
I was thinking the other day that my outreach goal probably shouldn't be to try to get Republicans to vote for Biden. I'm actually fine with them realizing they're so disgusted with Trump that they just don't vote at all. I think that step is increasingly easy for many.
Fucking God, please at least don't lie and say Biden is progressive. The only thing he is progressing towards is his grave in a few minutes
I can't tell if this movement is helping or hurting Biden's chances but it is hurting my chances of wanting to live anymore.
So have I, and they are voting for BIDEN.
And Biden will only pick you cuz he's an idiot.
Make no mistake, Joe Biden is a Reagan era Republican, as was Obama. Neither was even slightly progressive.

Something I'm curious about- if Mark Kelly wins in 2020 and so does Biden, where does the Crystal Ball rate his seat to begin 2022? I presume tossup, but maybe there's a case for something else?
Biden is the nominee, not Bernie. And Chuck Schumer isn’t in any great rush to become some leftist darling anytime soon.
Disappointed, was looking for Obama and Biden being reptilian leaders.
Inspired by  , I made a 2022 senate thing as well. In this one, Biden won narrowly in 2020. Map on the last image provides a composition. Senate coming in was 51-49, ultimately no net change but Murkowski's change to Indy makes a Dem 50-50 majority theoretically possible.
So we can count you down as a YES for Biden then?
Where are all those conservative trolls that keep telling me how racist Joe Biden is?
Would love to see Karen Bass get the nod.  I think Harris would make an amazing VP, but she's polarizing among black voters. Not a lot of trust there -- and not entirely unwarranted. That said, Biden could select a hamster &amp; I'd still very enthusiastically vote for him.
It’s also not fair, but her son is a big Trump supporter and former president of the Stanford College Republicans.  Fox News would have him on every single night talking about why Biden and his mom needed to be defeated.
It looks like y'all switch Trump's &amp; Biden's skin tones in photoshop.

Medicare for all mirrors the Canadian style system in which the government is everyone’s insurance company and paid for by taxes.  The Biden plan (public option) mirrors the German system, where there’s a government plan and private plans.
I'll bet money Biden never comes to the stage. If he comes to a online debate, their will be "technical trouble" as soon as he forgets what his own name is.
Shy Biden voters, natch
Personally I'm not worried about winning Wisconsin, because it isn't relevant to Dems control of the Senate. I'm more concerned that Biden is losing/close Arizona and North Carolina.
Joe Biden would be genuinely good at greeting people at Walmart or playing Solitaire in a retirement home, not as our president.
Oh yes, yes we do. More important and disturbing than Biden's sad declining health, is the fact that Democrats couldn't find a better candidate after pulling their hair out for the last 4 years.
Maybe it was just a lazy speech writer, but Biden implied his administration will prosecute people for their political beliefs absent of a crime. That's fascism. Pass it on.
im not even excited about biden and this would be me.

Who ever is his running mate will take over soon after inauguration . . . But it won't come to that.   will easily win once the U.S. sees Biden attempt to debate Trump and how far Biden's mind has gone.
Injustice? That’s one side of it. What about the disrespect. There are other things you can do then kneel in front of a flag a play a “black” national anthem, which, black people don’t even want played. As far as black lives matter goes, all of the money donated has gone to Biden

This was a repeal of the AFFH Rule, which you could have told people instead of subtlety campaigning for Biden. This helps preserve the ability of local governments to make their own decisions.

You sound like a racist...Most racist are uneducated.  Systemic racism may not stop one from getting a good job, but it stops one from getting paid equally, or being stereotyped.  You don't care though.  You've made up your mind that you know what you know and that's that.
Jennifer....how in the hell do you have the nerve to say this when it is painfully obvious to any one with half a brain that Biden has dementia

You are mistaken. I will not vote for Trump. Equally, I do not subscribe to the left wing agenda or ideology in any form at this point. If Biden picks a conservative VP, I might vote for him.  But it has to be a strong conservative.  Someone to offset....stupid.

No chance Biden's team agrees to debates. Covid gives them the perfect excuse to not do it.

Maybe we can agree to disagree on that point, but clearly Biden’s mental health is an issue. In the last hundred years (except Wilson, I suppose), we haven’t had a sitting President show such visible signs of mental deterioration, let alone an ostensible party nominee.
I think Biden has a few serious questions queued up for the debates.
I am sitting in my home as well as millions of other Americans and I feel completely safe. The process of protesting social injustice sometimes leads to violence on both sides. Sending your federal militia into  Portland has exacerbated the problem. Elect Joe Biden!!!!!

Right. You get the idea the dems are not so confident in all the polling showing Biden 10 points ahead. They wanted this opportunity to call trump a racist in front of their base.

Can you win? No. Which is why voting for you is a waste of someone's time and if they actually dislike Trump they should vote Biden instead. Not to mention I'm not fond of your party anyway.
After realizing I spent more on my 7 year olds gaming headset, than the Biden Campaign spent on noise cancelling mics, I quit watching.    Play by play here is so much better.
Joe Biden mixed up Tallahassee with Jacksonville
The “reporters” can only ask pre prepared questions so Biden can look at his notes or the teleprompter. Even given that tremendous advantage, Biden is still making many errors, stuttering, and losing his thoughts
U all really do say every damn second of every day some dum dum shit about biden. “He’s not the nominee we deserve but he’s the nominee we need” ?? What does that even mean. I mean really.......what doe s it mean
Did Joe Biden just say that law-breaking rioters should be arrested and prosecuted? 🤔
After his disastrous experience with COVID and PPE, he still can’t committ to voting for Biden? And you may run for president? Please!? Get your priorities straight!  Country first!  Trump is not fit for the presidency.  Wake up!
This is why some say Liberals are drama queens and Kings
They’re all old, rich and out of touch. People like Biden and Pelosi still think it’s 1993.
Another warning sign for Trump's reelection. Those claiming to be conservative dropped 6 points while those claiming to be moderate &amp; liberal increased by 2 &amp; 4 points respectively. Moderates now outnumber conservatives, &amp; Biden comes off more moderate.
Biden supporters tracking flights into Delaware.
It makes sense. I actually remember Rice and Biden taking the same side against Obama on Syria. At least that is how it was leaked to the press at the time.
Pretty much, yeah. People think that Trump &amp;co will be charged and even face prison time. Never gonna happen. At best, we'll get a toothless report in 3-4 years about their misconduct and then Biden's admin will decline to prosecute "in the interest of moving forward together"
These are not protesters in many cases, they are rioters. These are riots and you are Trump hating fool. Biden would be worse President in US history.
Thanks, I won't and won't enjoy Biden either

Jobs matter more than anything. I want to know who has the better plan. Don't forget how much Biden's VP matters, either. You've already made up your mind, though, so your consideration is kind of a dead issue.
To: Chris Wallace.   Why can’t you get Biden to allow you to interview him one on one? No handlers, no teleprompters.   Why no effort? We know you are a registered Democrat and that you enjoy the cognoscenti and glitterati, but shouldn’t you attempt to be less partisan?
Can’t wait for Joe Biden to make his VP announcement so I can watch y’all dumbasses behave like even bigger dumbasses.

Should it endorse Biden as the best candidate for conservatism?  You bet.  Not because Biden is conservative, but because he will reestablish norms necessary for conservative government.  And then it should fight Biden for four years as hard as it can.
Aahhhh I see, this is Dems making sure they can place blame somewhere else if Biden loses 🤷‍♂️ well it won’t work here. Blame Green Party voters, blame trump, but good god don’t blame the democrats for running a shit candidate..
I think hard core dems will vote for Biden realizing he is not going to be in charge.
And there’s nothing Trump and Biden have showed that’s convincing enough for them to earn my vote.
Biden landslide with something like  352-186 by my count.
Okay... so voting for who I want to be president is denial about the American system? That doesn’t make sense.. I need more than just “Trump is bad” to vote for someone man.. Biden is a terrible candidate, and voting for him would be a waste of my vote.
With maybe the exception of Bloomberg, Biden is literally the worst option they could have gone with.
Texans are NOT stupid enough to vote for Biden &amp; do nothing liberals!

On Sept. 29, barring further unforeseen catastrophe or readily predictable coronavirus-related issues, Joe Biden will debate President Trump in Cleveland.
If Biden picks his nose for V.P. I'm still voting against Trump.
It's so ridiculous that Biden is polling ahead in Georgia and Texas but Trump is leading in Ohio and people still think Ohio is a swing state
Absolutely. There is no reason it shouldn’t happen. 2 individuals on a stage with plenty of space in between, moderators at least 6 ft apart, &amp; no audience. The only reason it wouldn’t happen is because dems would continue to hide Biden. Biden needs to be on national TV.
Can't Make This Up! First Presidential Debate Will Be at Cleveland Clinic... In Case Senile Joe Biden Wigs Out  via
Flash forward to today, Biden has an overwhelming lead in the national polls and a strong lead in all swing states, as well as being neck in neck with Trump in Texas.
I am sure that WKRC and the MSM doesn’t want the debates to happen... do you think the people can’t see your reasoning?  Biden cannot stand on the stage and be coherent!  Riots and protests are encouraged but no Debates?  The MSM is full of Shit!
Biden's handlers can't let it happen.  Poor guy has early stages of dementia.  No way he can debate, even if they give his team the questions ahead of time like they did for Hillary.
I wish. The anti-Biden explosion will begin November 4.
Was he correct when he posted that you were voting for Biden?
Trump got him to run so the black vote would be split between him and Biden. That way as long as white ppl vote for Trump he is guaranteed 4 more years. Kanye is a mere puppet for Trump.

Karen Bass looks like a great choice for Biden.  Her progressive-ish politics would hopefully appeal to the left and as an olive branch to suburban white women, he'd be choosing a literal Karen.
Agree, Harris has been my 1st choice since way before Biden took the lead over Sanders, but I was addressing the comment that if he choose anyone else,  wouldn't vote for Biden. To not vote for Biden is tacit approval of a take over of the US by a fascist regime.
people have lost their minds if you think putting a woman in office makes any sense whatsoever! We all know Biden will be out almost as soon as he is in and then we deal with the awful consequences of his VP decision 😱

Keep stripping away the things that make voting for Biden a step forward for Americans and it’s hard to say if I’ll be ticking a box or writing a name in. Totally serious.   What does a Dem even bring to the table, without progressive ideas? The moderate ideas all suck.
I dont know why anyone expects the protests to end for one second by putting joe "shoot them in the legs" biden in power
This trump might win against Biden but Hillary would’ve played circles around him. Campaign is just so poorly ran! The messaging is so bad
Look I don't like Biden either but getting Trump out of office should 100% be our priority as an American people.
It's astonishing to see people say "just getting Trump out of office isn't enough to justify voting for Biden"  Sorry what?????
Relatively speaking, Ed Markey is like the Joe Biden in the race against Joe Kennedy: acceptable not on merit alone, but because the Kennedy is a basically a bag of dicks.
Is this a bad thing? I guess it is if you hate Hunter Biden.
I was waiting for something like this to come out after he changed his tune around on it, he needs to squash it so that he can continue to campaign and rally instead of the media campaigning for Biden
We do need Joe Biden...and Kamala Harris.  #BidenHarris2020
After Trump changed his tune around a little bit I was waiting for something like this to come out, he figures he needs to squash this covid so he can get back to rally’s and campaigning instead of the media doing it for Biden and knocking Trump
Maybe Obama wasn't running for something, but he did give the GOP a free attack ad by saying this on camera, and given how he's tied to Biden I feel as if an attack ad on it would have a similar effect regardless of whether it was Obama or Hypothetical VP nominee Bass.
I disagree because Biden is clearly off and I don’t think he will debate well.
Trump has a more enthusiastic base, but even that wasn’t enough to get popular vote in 2016. Biden is going to get more middle voters than Hillary.
See any Biden signs ?? I see none.
Even Biden is willing to reform the filibuster at this point.
Even he if did go, three things he would do: 1. Assassinate Lewis' character 2. Attack Biden 3. Make it all about himself.  So it's a good thing he didn't go. Saves the humiliation. Rest in paradise, John Lewis.
lol   One on One with Joe Biden ?  should be called One on 1/3 because Dementia Joe is not all there !
I think this was more true in 2016 than it is now. Biden is not a radical candidate. He can get swing voters.  Right now, the right is losing the middle.
Is it because Obama will be there?  Got news for you Donny boy, when Biden is being sworn in, you will have to be there, and so will the Obama’s.
Biden and Dems Are Set to Abolish the Suburbs
Really? Biden is losing the middle? I don’t think so
It’s hard to imagine a scenario where the left isn’t severely weakened by a Biden presidency
Biden is responsible for Covid 7-15 while he was vp.
The best way to ensure you will never be president is to be Biden’s VP. VPs almost never win election and Biden is determined to do nothing of note that would make his presidency popular.
Are you talking about Obama, Biden, the liberal fake news media, or ??
He must have the same thing that Biden has, only he’s still in the early stages.
How people in the mentions have used this as an opportunity to say suddenly this is ND “helping Biden” or makes them anti-anyone or pro-anyone is ridiculously stupid &amp; ignorant. The RNC just cancelled the Republican National Convention due to Corona in the same sense as this.
There is something about Kamala Harris that gives me pause. She seems disingenuous -- like she trying to fit a mold completely unfamiliar to her. Don't misunderstand. I'm voting for Biden regardless of who he picks. They're all infinitely more suited than our national disgrace.
I certainly hope so. Biden is a disaster
Black lives matters is just a tool the left is using . Click on the donate button for BLM and it takes you to bkue charities. Donations from BLM includes biden aoc  Bernie etc etc all left. Once again the left isnusing blacks. Shame on you Jake
Vote for Joe Biden and the great slate of Democratic Candidates.
I picked 12, although a couple are likely difficult (e.g. KY, but it's the principle).  AZ, CO, ME, NC, MT, KS, GA (2 races), IA, MI &amp; AL (Doug needs whatever help he can get to stay in office). We also giving to Kate in OH-1 &amp; Biden.  Stretching the budget.
If there is a debate, we should conduct a nationwide blackout (TV off or cable channel) for the duration. Biden won't mind and Trump will throw a hissy fit.
The university was set to host the inaugural face-off between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden on Sept. 29. Not anymore

My guess is it gets worse and worse and worse, then maybe plateau at some really awful daily number.   Then Biden and Dems wI’m back power, we go on a national lockdown and do it right.
If Biden wins watch how quick the Repubs get real concerned about the exploding deficit after printing Trillions and Trillions and Trillions of "free" money. It's gonna be comical.
The Sanders/Biden debate seemed to have nearly universal praise on Twitter, at least, for not having a crowd. I personally would have no issue if we never saw a crowd at a presidential debate again.

There is almost zero enthusiasm for Biden. Remember how much Clinton was going to win her rigged campaign?

The hard truth is- Biden needs women- and particularly women of color to vote for him.   Once the election is over he, and really the evil forces he is working for, will go back to their evil agenda of domination and control of the human species. They will lose and Love will win

The argument is relevant and much the same today. Perhaps the only caveat is that Europe shouldn’t just pop the champagne if/when Biden wins — Europe must craft a more coherent collective strategy to pursue and protect its principles &amp; interests, regardless of who’s in the WH.

Joe Biden is the most racist politician in modern history. Why would anyone be surprised his staff is bullying a Black woman? They’re just leading by example (ie. Anita Hill).

I agree. I have faith in Biden’s eventual choice. But this process has  fed anxiety, racism, misogynoir, the whole menu. I hope that most of America is oblivious to it, and that there is some point I don’t get. Maybe limiting the window of Putin smears. 🤷🏻‍♀️

I'll be honest. Biden could pick a rock to be VP and I would still vote for him.
President Biden or President Pelosi?  I feel like that’s a win-win.
I didn’t say that whatsoever. Projection is strong today... wonder why..? 🤔
It's true. Biden, Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump are all warmongering pedophiles.
True, but black women lifted Biden up when he was down. I believe you've got to dance with the ones that brung you. Kamala is excellent at skewering the GOP, and Demings has a way of getting right to the point without messing around. I think Duckworth is low key but very sharp.
I mean...I'm agnostic and pretty much find all cults, large and small, to be equally hilarious...but Scientology in particular just seems like a bizarre corporate scam masquerading as a religion.  Maybe there has never been much of a difference.  But this cannot be Biden's best.
And still more than Biden could ever pull.
That’s not the point and you know it. Biden said he would have a woman of color as VP and then double down on a black women VP.

You know what? Biden has got a seriously GREAT list of potential VPs. I'm not sure which one I like best. Not that anybody is asking me. But I like a lot of them. Trouble with some of the choices he could pick is I'd also like to see them in other offices. 1/2
Thanks Obama/Biden
I think she rubs enough people the wrong way to blow the election.  There are far better choices. Karen Bass or Susan Rice for example. Assets to Biden and more than qualified to take over if needed. That can’t be said for Harris.
No matter who, or when, Biden picked his VP the choice would be criticized by some and loved by others. I am OK with his choice &amp; recognize that he's the guy who is going to need our help to defeat Trump.
Most aren't but yet there's some that think tapioca with pickles biden is a good candidate

It is incredibly interesting to me that Warren leads the “less enthusiastic” and “are thinking about but not definitely voting for Biden” categories. Is this suggesting that ultra-plugged in Democrats want Harris over Warren???
I’m hoping for a blowout! Biden winning maybe 40 states!  Please! Please! Please!
Why does BLM give their donations to 40 yr politician, Joe Biden campaign? Would you agree it shld be given to struggling black communities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit? Open source  Do your research😎 9 whites is more than 6 blacks
Donald Trump can't (legally) move the 2020 election - but GOP have something else in mind to keep him on power for life like Putin. #SmartNews
Americans are dying because Trump failed America no other reason and we will Vote Biden to Rebuild what Trump has destroyed what's Sad is more Americans will Die because Trump has lied to cover up for his failure as a human being We cannot survive another 4 years of his LIES!
I don't think Biden will have to file any lawsuit. Once Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20th, Trump is a trespasser in the White House and Federal Marshals will carry his ass out (and probably directly to jail).
Lee would have same issues as Warren... Anti corruption, progressive, not under influence of donors. Warren should be nominee... And I will be shocked if Biden will be independent enough from donors and establishment to choose her. I have been amazed he's adopted so many plans.

You're opinion about Kamala Harris is uninformed &amp; wreaks of old white man politics. YOU rub people the wrong way. YOU are the minority now. YOU should let Biden make this decision w/o you putting this kind of crap into the discussion.
All of the violence we see in the streets is under TRUMP.  Don't allow the snakes to trick you..  This isn't Biden's America - because HE'S NOT President.  It's Trumps America and it's HIS violence - HE is starting with OUR troops. Facts first - and last.
Well, u kind of kicked off this 💩 show of a VP stakes by spreading hate and misinformation about Klobuchar.  I will agree that I wish Biden had chosen someone earlier and shut down all this nonsense
Trying to slander Joe Biden won't work.   You're the one who has caused chaos by deploying jack-booted, unidentified &amp; VICIOUS 'Secret Police' to attack Americans, both law-abiding citizens, legally protesting, &amp; criminals, who should be arrested, not beaten senseless.
🤣🤣 They are a block of votes that are being pandered by Dems to teachers, to help Biden. 🤦‍♀️  This is the corrupt politics that Americans are now seeing. It’s not about the children and teachers, it’s about an election. Period. Campaigns against Charter Schools also. Disgusting
Kamala Harris has the same issue as HRC imo, in that she seems more disingenuous the more you listen to her. This doesn’t matter much for a VP but it could hurt Biden if the person he chooses is seen as inauthentic.
I don’t think so but I’m sure you might find pedophile Biden hanging around I know he would not be on that island he goes after everybody’s kid here in the states why should he go to an island
Have to wonder what “she’s too ambitious“ means in the context of a vice presidential choice. Are they afraid one of them would poison handshake Biden and take over the presidency? smdh
If you vote for Biden you're voting for Communism in America. No Thank You!
Introducing your new President...Joe Biden... live from his basement...ready to rule America.....”Mam.”!!!  “Hot pockets now Mam..”..!
Good Choice, AMERICANS will feel Honored by her nomination.
Jill Biden.
Trump says vote by mail will be a "disaster" for his reelection. He says "Republicans will never win another election".
And if Biden goes for someone seemingly less threatening, they will say she isn’t strong enough.  Enough.
Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Susan Rice, Val Demmings, etc. The positive to focus on is that there are outstanding candidates &amp; the ticket is going to be very strong. My money remains on Harris &amp; Warren. Biden wants someone who can step in to take over if needed. They could.
You make a good Biden supporter. He voted to overturn the Glass-Steagall Act, which had protected US from predatory banking. This lead to 2008 bank fail. Then Biden voted taxpayers be on the hook for failed banks.
Before you vote for Biden as president you might want to check to see how President Kamala can handle herself in a Civil War
No surprise they did the same with Biden
I find it pretty gross.  Agree with you, if Biden feels this way, just don’t pick her.  This negative slime is unnecessary.
I doubt he will choose a simpering q-tip.
You are aware that Biden is a Commie, at least the RNC will say so. So is Abrams, Harris..........
Better electorally than Biden? Prob not, but with Trump spiraling so much I don’t think it would matter
Biden will take advice along with his own vast experience (unlike Trump ) to choose the best VP
On January 21, 2021, when Biden takes over, I'll resume my normal tweeting about nature, animals, gardening, rock hounding, and oddities.  No more politics 😩 #Biden2020
Biden msg on 100k death milestone:
Biden has been in Washington since 1972, he is the epitome of everything wrong with Washington and politics.
Dear  please state how you feel about people voting for you over Biden in this election, b/c people keep saying they're going to "vote their conscience" &amp; it's some scary shit when Trump is such a racist, misogynist, totalitarian-wanna-be, douchecanoe. Thanks.
The constant, escalating war on freedom of the press. GOP authoritarianism in play.
Teachers Unions  have become lobbyist not educators.  R children R left out of the equation. Biden told teachers he would be their for them.
While everyone’s inevitably gearing up to (likely rightfully) complain about Biden’s VP, just a reminder that we could’ve had the Bernie/Barabara Lee ticket or the Warren/Castro ticket 🙃
Nope. Truth is truth.  If he wants our vote, he has to be a Lefty.   If he wants to roll the dice on his policies with the expectation we'll vote for him regardless, he'll learn the hard way.   I don't want another Iraq War whether it's done by Biden or Trump.
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
I'm not going to complain about a careful choice. Biden is not the enemy.
like joe biden...he doesnt even know his wife from his sister or the fact he cant form 1 single declarative sentence..speaking ones own mind doesnt have a limit...its not up 2 u 2 decide how much he can say, what volume &amp; what he can say
I am voting for him, because once a culture of conflict is started--i.e riots lasting longer than a month like we have in Portland-- it's difficult to undo. Trump's troops are here.  But don't confuse this, just b.c Biden gets my vote, doesn't mean I'm not going to criticize him.
Surrogates? Or wannabes? With the obvious exception of Dodd is there anyone from the actual Biden Campaign Committee and/or VP Selection Committee who is attacking Kamala?  Are these people who just know Biden from his decades in politics, &amp; pundits who are creating "stories"?
Don't overlook Water Island where Joe Biden &amp; his brother have property there. It's a short sail from Epstein Island. No wonder there were no Biden names on flight records.
Lol. We can't wait for sleepy Joe Biden. It will be nice not to watch the president like he's a toddler. We're all sick and tired of you.
Can you imagine being this guy the night of November 3rd if or when Biden is announced the winner. Holy shit.
That's a safe response. Biden has always stuttered. Biden is capable of admitting mistakes and accepting responsibility. Biden will genuinely put people with actual expertise in cabinet. When the person we're not talking about does the same, let me know. #BidenBlue2020
Biden did NOT appoint this guy to his VP selection committee. That's why he's whining to the press - in a feeble attempt to have input, because Joe isn't listening to him. Biden appointed only ONE white male to his selection committee, and only two males.
The sort of wisdom every guy knows about but is prudent enough never to bring up around women.   For context, Stern used to bring on naked women onto his morning show for the team to ogle at. It's a radio show for dudes– It's not The View. Is this really blowing anyone's mind???
Biden’s advisors gave “him” a deadline.  Lmfao. Give me a break. Biden has very little to do with picking his own VP. Much like he’s not going to be doing much to run the country. HE IS SLEEPING not LEADING.
Also, Biden came out the other day calling our protestors in Portland “violent looters and anarchists”. Yo need to justify the claim that Biden will give more of a voice to progressives than Trump has, it’s not that I straight-up don’t believe you but you need to justify it.
Why are pundits digging up quotes like that from people who were NOT appointed by Biden to his VP selection committee? #KamalaHarrisForVP  #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
Biden was never invited to any of the elite satanic orgies because no one wanted to hang out with him.
This is pretty unhinged, because nobody’s just “not excited” about Biden. We’re pissed he isn’t addressing the issues that put Trump in office. Sorry, we aren’t lemmings, we know this country’s been broken a long time. Biden’s platform is painfully insufficient for our problems.

Biden talking to Biden.  Truly a beautiful sight...
He has no reason to pivot after oath, that’s the same corner progressives have been backed into the last 40 years. Beating Trump won’t fix this country, we need to address the systemic issues that put him in office. If Biden’s not gonna do that, he’s just delaying the inevitable
Yes, and also, "Watch the water".... China vs storm Dorian &amp; Water Island near Epstein Island where Biden brothers bought property.
I can guarantee there won't be "50 years" with Biden. He's not Methuselah for crying out loud.
Yes I'm tired of it too. Biden will pick the person he feels suits him and his agenda best. No Twitter polls will make any difference.
The people Biden choose for his VP selection panel is a horror and told us everything we needed to know.
a close friend who I had convinced to vote Biden went to one of these and was made to confess of a racist behavior on his part. He decided right then and there to vote Trump and I could not talk him out of it.
Things that piss me off:   People who believe we shouldn't criticize Biden because he's running against Trump.   The truth regarding his record is the truth, we don't hide the truth because it's convenient.
I'm defending Biden and the process, but I won't forget what some of the interviewees in the article said. Not all the bigots are Republicans. We have a lot of work to do on our own party.
You mean the Obama/Biden legacy🤔
FWIW - 2 of the 3 writers of the article are women; 1 is a woman of color. There is only 1 white male on Biden's VP selection committee, &amp; 2 of the 4 are women; 1 is a woman of color, 2 of the 4 are POC.  PS - Kamala is my 1st choice, Warren is 2nd. No men would make my top 5.
everybody and charlie “cc” loves trump in a landslide get out and vote absentee or in person is the only way your vote will be counted...President needs to win by a landslide, so it won’t be close to have to count...President should have a mock debate with Biden on U Tube. c.c.
Goddamn, I'm officially a Biden booster now
When Joe Biden  is elected President, he will have a lot of White House cleaning to do. Getting rid of Trump's 'yes' men should be his first actions. We need truth, not Trump!
I wish I could vote for the version of Joe Biden in that guy's head and not the real Joe Biden
This is why my fav funny scenario is Biden wins, GOP holds senate 51-49. Then in 2022, GOP narrowly loses senate but flips the house.
Joe Biden should be denied the Bidy, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus. Support for the wholesale slaughter of innocent children in their mothers' wombs is an abomination!
You think you have long lines at places now, wait until Biden gets in and his party completely upends democracy as we know it!
Biden is the pedophile!
I’m guessing he’ll claim/announce he won on election night, and then as more mail-in ballots come in and are counted, and Biden’s numbers rise, he’ll scream fraud/rigged and how Dem’s are trying to steal the election. He’ll take it to SCOTUS and create another national crisis.
It’s up to Biden and I trust him. This is silly,

Biden grew. Biden learned. Biden changed his opinion. Biden fights for rights for all. Trump has lived an entire life of racism, every turn he threatens the liberties of minorities and BIPOC so your tweet is inane.
If your loved one needed one..like when  was begging for them...should they have refused ?  This is ridiculous.  We now have them stockpiled in the empty warehouse that Obama/Biden left bare...and are finally getting critical supplies made in the US.
Mmhhhmm. Photoshop joe biden now!
The same way Trump is behind Biden in polls.
Trump's problem isn't that he's not prepared to run against Biden. It's that he has to get elected despite his obvious inability to govern.  I feel like this (Presidential) is just like everything else he's ever dipped a toe into. He's terrible at it, but now can't get out safely
Spoken like a pissy 12-year-old.  Vote for Biden. He won't tweet like he's still in Junior High.

True. I mean Obama was a piece of crap president and Biden can't remember what day it is but you should hate a president who tweets because the media lies constantly about him and his policies have been amazing for our country. He's governed better than any president in 100 years

I can’t support Beijing Biden, but maybe you can. Remember that many of our greatest generals also read the Art of War.
I have a bridge to sell you if you think Biden is going to fix any underlying problems that exist in America, he's not, and we're not going to "push him from the left," but wanting to not live in plague world where you can't do anything isn't selfish and really is ok
I wanna study abroad and go to concerts and shit and if Trump wins reelection it really will not be safe to do so for maybe years b/c he's botched it so horribly. Biden is an awful person, and I'm probably voting for him, because I want to be able to like go about my life
Like you can talk for hours about foreign policy (dog shit) or domestic policy (terrible) or personal integrity (hahahahahahahaha) but really that is the most compelling case Biden has going - if Trump wins, COVID keeps rolling for a long, long time.
Biden's best pitch is just "if Trump wins reelection you won't be able to go to concerts or out to eat at nice cafes until at least 2022"
You are amazing.  We stand with you. Not Biden.

I'm not going to say that I know what happened there, but I don't think it's cut and dry based on the reading I did. But I think if you looked at the late 70s/early 80s and McCain/Biden/Dodd/Kennedy ... I dunno. But I don't really hero worship anyone anymore so

The thing that’s honestly most offensive about the Chapo bros is how fucking stupid they are. Yes, sure, voters are going to reject Biden because of a line in a eulogy by an incredibly popular former president. Yes, that’s exactly how normal people decide who to vote for. 🙄
Yet you support Biden 😂

I didn’t for a while because I let myself be convinced by “conventional wisdom” that it couldn’t ever be Warren for X, Y, Z reasons. I didn’t think Biden would do it, but the more and more I thought about it, I know in my bones she’s the best candidate for the job.
Tell Biden and Obama.
Biden was not my first choice. We don’t need another old white man as president. But if he’s  one that’s going to oust Trump from the White House, I’m right behind him. Trump needs to go. Yesterday.

Maybe now begin to focus on Nina Turner 2024 THIRD PARTY?
Biden may beat Trump. The party is cooked just like the GOP. They don’t know it yet; just like the GOP.
What’s that you say?  It’s only rigged if Biden is winning??? You’re going to lose BIGLY Donald.  I can’t wait to see you behind bars.
If she had been AG, a Senator, then ran a presidential campaign that was as good as at least Biden’s, she would be more qualified in my eyes.  And I supported Kamala until the end of summer last year.
Warren is younger then Biden...so age really doesn’t have anything to do with it
Biden 2020 muthafuckah... The fuck outta here.
No, I'm a realist. My choice is between an incompetent narcissist and budding fascist in Trump or a competent, compassionate and empathetic person who respects Democracy and the rule of law in Biden. I'll chose the second person every time and so will the majority of Americans.
Because you don't even know how to use a Smart Phone, much less figure out how to send a Tweet, Mr. Biden.
Well, Biden will take office and Trump can run around the country looking for a "court" that will let him cheat.  Good luck with that...
Please just go away.  I'm still #RidinWithBiden2020 I wouldn't ever vote for a Republican especially after the last 4 years of trumps shit show.  Joe Biden will make this country sane again.  #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Ok buddy. Don’t be mad because nobody liked you enough for you to be elected. You kept all you’re donations for yourself instead of putting them Towards what you wanted to fix. You wanna call out racism but Joe Biden has done so many racist things that anyone can look up.
Please. What was the time elapsed when he was asked a question and lied over?   I love how you twist that 3 hrs &amp; 33min of Democratic propaganda into 17 minutes of wasted time. Would you like to “reclaim your time” mr Biden?  I’d like to reclaim the 3hrs &amp; 15m AG Barr #thuglife
Trump 2020!  I believe in America and patriotism. A vote for Biden is a vote for communism takeover of America.  If you don’t like your country, you can always move to China.  The people who are complaining about Trump said they would move out?  I’m Still waiting
We all thought he was going to do great things.... and we got nothing... he got millions... even Biden’s son got millions... Americans got squat...
Biden supports corruption.  So does his delegates.
Biden should drop out and endorse President Trump.  Now is not the time for petty partisan election politics.
I think it’s hilarious that Trump supporters make fun of Biden for being old and delusional like... y’all do realize the irony right?
We will VOTE 🗳! Biden!🌊🌊
I WANT Biden &amp; Trump to debate.  I know Biden is going to use any excuse to avoid it but "We the People"  deserve to see it!
I'm voting for Biden. You're going to lose come November 3rd. Oh, and just so you can't claim my vote is fraudulent. I've already got my new enhanced driver's license and I'm voting in person.
I'm voting for Biden.  #BlueWave2020
As a parent, I want schools to open. But safely. Biden is FAR better than Trump &amp; he’ll bring in better appointments.
Remember when Biden predicted he would try it and republicans lost their collective shit?  Today from republicans : crickets...
We NEED to put a BIDEN win-win stitch in that lose-lose sitch!
Yeah, I rely on the Trump fan club for accurate information on Biden and his family. 🙄
That is why we need Biden to win by a huge majority.
Wishful thought... Biden becomes POTUS, RGB then retires and Obama gets the job.
Biden should be proactive and do something outrageous to hijack the news cycle, then dominate it consistently.

They do mean something. Once again the Democrats have given a crappy alternative to Trump. Covid hit and y’all just gave up and came up with some stupid unity plan, and had a Biden promise a minority/female for VP in trade for the nomination.
I'm voting in person no matter what. Why? Because this election is that important. It won't decide just the next four years, but the fate of this country. If Trump wins, Democracy and the rule of law effectively dies. If Biden wins, we have a chance to come back from the brink.

Biden says Trump may try to delay the election. Trump says Trump may try to delay the election.  And you both sides it?
Stop the partisanship bullshit. Biden hasn’t done anything beneficial since he’s been in politics. He’s an example of why we need term limits. The lesser of two evils shit makes people look like dumbasses
Understood. There is a slight chance Biden could get elected!
What are you talking about? Biden is a career conservative Democrat.
You really managed to get out though by Biden. Gotta say, I'm impressed.
Biden has 0 children accusing him of being a pedo. Trump cannot say the same. Trump called White supremacist good people and left a video of a man yelling white power for 3 hours. Biden hasn’t one that. Biden also has the support of blacks by 92% to Trumps 8%
I’m crowing policy and against Trump. Biden is ok. Not my first pick.
You typed Biden but you ment Clinton.
I wish. Seems unlikely any of this will happen. First of all (as in 2009!) there’ll be an ongoing emergency taking up all the oxygen. And second of all Biden just doesn’t seem to have that in him, for better and worse.
biden as a literal chest-of-drawers
"it's possible Trump, intentionally or not, is setting a trap by shifting more of his own vote to Election Day while Biden's ballots face a higher risk of rejection, legal limbo and lengthy counting delays. That should set off alarm bells for Democrats."
Biden Calls For Arrest Of Anarchists  via
But I don’t need to like the man I’m voting for.  Don’t like Biden either.
VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Pathetic Prez testing the strength of America’s democracy by suggesting he may postpone the 2020 election. This Prez has no strategy to win the election he’s likely to lose. Instead he’s just doing all he can to try and steal the election.”VOTE BIDEN 2020
Biden campaign sets sights on Ohio with new ad buys  -
A lot of Hilary hate for legit reasons or not too. Regardless, I’m not a Biden fan, but it should be a pretty easy decision for anyone that is not on the far, far right to vote Biden over Trump.
I didn't remember.  That's horrible behavior, closing polls early, or refusing to extend them while people are in line to vote.  I'm a fan or Bernie and would be much happier with him over Biden.  Have there been reports of democrats limiting voting in republican districts?
“ Yesterday Pathetic Prez said he’ll protect white suburbanites from the threat of low income housing encroaching on their sacred neighborhoods. BLATANT RACISM   Today he says he may consider an attempt to postpone the 2020 election due to mail-in voting TYRANNY.” VOTE BIDEN 2020
I’m sorry but... is this irony? Like this has BEEN the cycle for 40 years. This is what WILL happen when Biden takes office. We can flip a coin just be sure I guess, but it’s a heavily weighted coin. He’s a corporate extremist, he’s gonna do what they always do. It’s predictable.
Harm reduction has been my only moral justification for voting Biden thus far. If he removes that incentive by calling our protestors “violent anarchists” then I’m left no reason to vote for him if there’s no actual reduction in harm.
GOP would explode if he became Biden’s VP.
This just isn’t even true logically? Like you can vote Biden while also constantly hounding him on policy, or you can campaign for what you WANT his platform to be and condition your vote on his policies... unless you want, you know, complete obedience. That would be a problem.
Not the democrat left either. The real political left. Just in case this tweet gets traction and a bunch of conservatives start shouting about Joe Biden being some Marxist or some shit
We don’t need to wait show up at your polling place mask on and wash your hands when leaving don’t touch your face in between and stay 6 feet apart what’s the problem. Then come November 4th if you voted for Joe Biden you will relies you wasted your time
Entire US population: “Our planet is dying, our people are dying, our economy is dying, everything is dying, pls help us pls give us something”  Biden: “Yeah, something needs to be done about the violent anarchists in our streets. For the other stuff, how ‘bout a tax credit?”
I'm with you.  I would say it's a lack of perspective. Political &amp; social change takes time - more evolution than revolution.  Not voting for Biden because he's not Bernie or not behind #M4A results in support for #Trump2020. It just does.
You know she hates Biden too right? 😂
I'll have to refer to my Pelosi vs Biden neoliberalism card deck. She's queen of her suit. He's still a left-punching insufferable aging knave opposing pot legalization to keep Boss Hoggs beating the shit out of Black kids. Meanwhile, Trump's the embodiment of evil. Go Nancy.
"Joe Biden is far left"
'Settle For Biden' Is Real, and It's Spectacular
2nd Quarter Economic Numbers Truly Horrible!  Earlier tweets trying to avoid the news? Your response to the continuing Covid crisis is a big indicator of your demise!  #TrumpIsUnwell #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
Trump can't delay the election. Even his GOP allies recognize that: "Republicans Reject Trump’s Suggestion to Delay Election, Something He Cannot Do"
You have now entered idiot territory. You also going to speak at Biden’s coronation?
Joe Biden... More like... Bad candidate. Got 'em
Probably as good as it’s going for Biden and HRC. 😂🤣
I know there is now way that she would accept the position as vice president, but I wish Michelle Obama would be Biden's pick. It would be wonderful.
I'm more grumpy-toddler-fuming-in-the-back-seat with Biden as opposed to ridin' but that doesn't change this
Instead of delaying it, Biden should drop out and endorse President Trump.
We will vote for Biden
Very shocking, I agree! Those Acts must be revitalized after Biden takes over!
I'm NOT afraid to admit I like him. I voted for him 2016 &amp; I will be voting for him again. Atleast I'm NOT voting for pedophile Biden.
Ya her attacks saying women couldn't beat Trump in 2020 were damn freaking stupid.  She was so far up biden's ahole she called Harris and Warren wasted votes.
Care to comment on your very well-aged opinion piece regarding Biden's prescient words about Trump and the November election? I'm curious how you'll walk that one back.
No!  I think Biden wins by a landslide.
No, he is a chihuahua. He’s been on TV for at least a year, promising to bring all of the big guys in. We got Rosenstein 🙄 It was a year ago when he promised to get to the bottom of Biden/Ukraine. 🦗 🦗🦗
YES, SHE BIT SIX PEOPLE WEARING ANTIFA T-SHIRTS, FOUR PEOPLE WEARING BIDEN T-SHIRTS, NINE TEENAGERS WITH PANTS HANGING PAST THEIR BUTT CRACKS, AND THREE FLAG BURNERS. FOR THE LAST TIME. . .THE DOG IS NOT FOR SALE! AND NO, WE DON'T APPROVE OF HER GETTING IN THE TRASH....CONTINUES
Nope! That’s why they show Biden in the lead😂
I don’t believe I will see uniformed soldiers ( from a disgusting version of Hitler’s SS) attacking American citizens while Biden is cleaning up your 3years of destruction.
Same excuse Biden has, they don’t care...
No they knew what’s up. Biden is worse for black ppl he’s the one who wrote the bills for “war on drugs” and “war on crime” in the black communities
But before all of that, #VoteBlue2020! We will drag him out in handcuffs if necessary.  On day one, Biden must #FireBarr and #AppointSchiff so Trump can be destroyed. Take his passport. Take his plane. Freeze his personal and business assets. 11/
He's setting up Biden. Trump will spend a fortune on making #FortTrump impenetrable and tacky. When Biden's elected, he'll be vilified for spending more taxpayer money to purge the Trump bacteria. Here's an idea... /7
Under no circumstances whatsoever...should the November elections WVER be delayed!   ......How jn the world could the Democratic Party Ofer up such a poor candidate as Mr. Biden....(great 20 yrs ago maybe)
The whole situation is weird . Biden has said he’s only doing one term due his age which tells you the VP will take over at some point .  Looking forward to the debates ! They will see the real joe Biden
Biden actually listens to experts, so wears a mask &amp; maintains social distancing.  But you go right ahead &amp; hope for his death...just proves you DO deserve the title 'Deplorable'.
#TDRlive thanks for the mashup of fo(x)lks who called Biden a fibber for saying trump might try to delay election
Hope this story includes all the fo(x)lks who called Biden a liar for saying Trump wants to delay the election
Vote Red 2020 Demonkrats will destroy this country and put us back to the 60s all over again. Demonkrats are not for America they are for CCP ask Joe Biden and the Dems.
“Majority of Republicans continue to follow the Negating Covid Denial of Pathetic Prez. Denounce masks, forget social distancing, open economies before meeting W.H. guidelines. WTF?  Pandemic experts calling for an immediate reset on our COVID-19 response. RESET NOW.” &amp;VOTE BIDEN
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! WE NEED BIDEN NOW
My Joke: “on 11/3 I’m voting for Trump“ (End of Joke) p.s. there’s an “if” (&amp; it’s big), he (Trump) has to announce  the 1st Debate: “Biden is 8X the man I’ll ever be...I urge a vote for Joe &amp; if there is a SCOTUS vacancy b4 1/20/2021, I believe Barack Obama is a logical choice”
If i do get polled i'm telling them that i'm voting for Biden just to mess with them !
Did a 6.5 hour drive across Oregon yesterday.  Huge Trump banners and flags in literally every town. Not a single Biden anything.
Biden VP choice. I'd be happy with Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, or Tammy Duckworth. All have pros and cons. All are better than Mike Pence or Nikki Haley.  Any of them could assume the presidency and do a very competent job.
We all need to prepare ourselves for what is likely to be a period of tremendous instability and potentially widespread violence. No matter who wins. If Trump wins, he will go full authoritarian. If Biden wins, Trump will declare a coup and incite retributive attacks.
4/ More worrisome if you believe he colluded with Ukraine to undermine Biden, or colluded with Russia to win in 2016.
Surprise, surprise. There is no way this administration can pull off a logistical strategy of this scope. Hoping that Biden’s team is developing a plan, or maybe it is in the Obama playbook that was tossed out.
#Delusional #Desperate #DictatorTrump This man is a menace and must be removed at all costs. AREN'T YOU MAD AS HELL??
I don’t entirely disagree, but we need to start somewhere and it’s pretty clear that getting Trump out must be step one. I’m not a registered Democrat and would gladly vote for another viable candidate, but I think Biden deserves a chance to listen and respond.
If he's gonna flee I suspect it would happen before the inauguration, before Biden has authority to take preventative steps.
“Louie Gohmert epitomizing stupidity at the most extreme level. Contracts COVID after denouncing masks and not wearing one. Claims he may have got the virus from wearing a mask. Stupid Is As Stupid Does. Republicans, what bunch of clowns.” VOTE BIDEN 2020
Rumor has it that Biden is picking Kamala Harris for VP on Aug 1st. The dems are not trying to win at all by picking a fucking cop as VP. The dems have also passed Trump’s entire agenda.  We do not have two parties, we have an oligarchy. #rejectthetwopartysystem #BackyardPolitix
USPS is incompetent and crooked. I doubt you even need to take the civil service test to work for them anymore? In addition, they've come out endorsing Joe Biden, what's that tell you.
Trump, trailing Biden, suggests delaying the election. He can't do that, experts say.
Loud? LOUD? You mean childish, self-aggrandizing, bullying, militantly ignorant, mean, spiteful and aggressively stupid? If that would be the ONLY thing that would change, if we could have a president who acts like a competent adult, voting for Biden would be more than worth it.
what are we supposed to do as american people if biden wins but trump denies the win and refuses to accept it?? what are we supposed to do then? will the people who have a brain tell him that he can’t just reject the results? or will we somehow end up with this fuck face again?
I am all in one thing people never mention is Her choice would decimate the Trump Biden hates the police rhetoric
Joe Biden would make a fantastic candidate for the Democrats!!  As long as he doesn't have to talk.
Stay silent you’re a minority! Biden 2920!!
Republican cowards can't comment on the President but sure they'll talk about Biden.
We’ll be dancing when Biden kicks it.
Donald Trump could shoot me in the middle of fifth avenue and I would still vote for Joe Biden.
My birthday, the election with a Biden win is the only gift I want.
Biden's climate plan won praise from progressives. Now he needs their votes.  Listening to all factions within the party has led to a comprehensive climate plan.   Biden will work with everyone to fix America.  #ONEV1 #Biden2020 #Z25
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ruining country will be #obamagate 2.0
You wanna change the date?  Then let's vote next week.  Get it over with.  We don't need to hear a debate between you and Biden.  Let's vote now!!!
Joe Biden picks running mate who slept her way into her current position. Wondering how will she negotiate deals with foreign powers? Quid pro or sex? #realeyesrealizereallies #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
#PresidentPelosi it is then! I kinda don’t care if it is #Biden, or #Pelosi, I can work with either one.
And, Through dust storms, floods, earthquakes, fire, murder locust and clorox wipes shortages—with every fiber my being, I will vote for Biden!
Joe Biden owned Water Island which is right next to Epstein Island. My guess is there is something much more nefarious going on there with Joe.
Defund criminal liberals! Leave them to protect themselves! Pull the pillows from under #sleepyjoe , prop him up and send him up. #joe Biden is a puppet. #BacktheBlue
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election
Biden won’t decriminalize marijuana. He doesn’t want that prison revenue to dry up.
Obama's eulogy at John Lewis's funeral, Biden's VP pick, the tanking economy, the SDNY statue of limitations ... Shall I go on?
Sure as long as Trump resigns on November 3, 2020 and Biden fills in.
Get real. If "the radical left" had its way, Biden would have lost by a landslide.
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election   #traitors #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing   "Trump Virus"
My biggest issue with Biden’s VP pick is that he announced early that he will choose a black woman. I thought we don’t discriminate against people based on their race or gender in this country.🤔
We need to landslide trump so badly in November that any doubts will be removed. Ridin with Biden!!!
...just as Joe Biden predicted...  Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
This is not the American dream. This is the American nightmare.  Vote for Biden. It fucking sucks. He sucks. I know.   But this shit has got to end.
Trump will protect us.  Biden has more ties to Russia then Trump via his son.
Wait until your old man gets his ass kicked by Joe Biden in November. The entire Trump name will be forgotten after the criminal trials are done and you are chilling in a cell.🤡🤡🤡👏
White House Spiritual Advisor Blasts Biden’s Marijuana Policy Record
Fuck joe biden
Remember when Biden said Trump will try to delay voting Nov 3rd because of the pandemic and you people attacked him for it?  Are you concerned now? Its safe enough to pack schools with kids but not to vote now? MAIL IN VOTING NOW!
This is just wrong. Everything has risks attached and no one knows which candidate was a sure-fire win, if any of them were. Biden is well ahead and picking a female VP, we did pretty good, didn't we?
And the Biden will have the secret Service drag his ample ass out and toss he out to the sidewalk
People wonder why Repugnants are so anti-mask. I figured it out.  They/Trump had to invent issues they think they might be able to win-bc they are losing every issue in the country by such huge margins. LOSING EVERY ISSUE.  So they started inventing issues.  Hunter Biden became 1
Elizabeth Warren is probably the most qualified,besides Biden, but her politics may not be those of most voters. Demonizing Harris bc she was a prosecutor is absurd. But there are absurd ppl who use anything they can find to push entirely different causes.Hypocrisy is okay today.

Trump vs Biden 2020 Dog Toys
Fracking is dead. It is far too costly, financially and environmentally. Biden won’t need to kill it. Trump beat him to it.

Trumpers are lying abt everything under the Sun to bring up Biden's negatives. And Johnson is going full-steam ahead with his Senate committee to look into Joe and Hunter Biden, and those Trumpers outside of govt are talking abt Ukraine investigating Joe, treason (he can't commit
Lastly, you can’t call it a right wing conspiracy just because a republican tweeted about it.  This isn’t a left or right political issue.  Trump and Biden both raped kids on Epstein’s island.  The 2 party system needs to be broken.  But you go on and keep unfollowing.
Love the mid-century hairdo, mid-century thinking, less so. 'the tRump' brags, repeatedly, about 'passing' a simple 30 question cognitive assessment test as if it proves he's a genius. That's not just pathetic, but stupid. It's why he's a laughing stock to the world. Biden isn't.
Thank you!!! I havd been saying the same- it gives HIM ideas AND a validation of his right to do so. Stop it- the POTUS is going to be the winner, Biden can Zoom it in if needed. The WH is a building and he will be evicted when he loses
Libs like this guy will be defending fascism and coups and police brutality as soon as Biden takes over.
"The collection of documents that Biden donated to his alma mater fills 1,875 boxes and also includes 415 gigabytes of electronic records. It includes committee reports, drafts of legislation and correspondence."
Oh, this Biden
Biden can’t fix the crimate clisis!!  Admission by his own words!!
Biden... Biden.... Biden.  Need I say more?
Do you have any idea what it says about you that choosing between Donald fucking Trump and Joe Biden is a difficult decision? Do you really lack that much self-awareness??
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
Trump supporters are cultists. I’m not “enthusiastic” about Biden. I’m determined to save my country. Coldly, rationally, at times desperately. I’ll be enthusiastic once the Jackass is out of the WH and we can start building a better country.
No. Biden is worse than trump. You’re unknowingly spreading anti black propaganda
Thanks for including me doll❤ Just seeing this.. Busy as fuck today. Hope you had a good humo day🤗❤😘
You know, Biblically speaking, a shaking is to come before the last great outpouring the Holy Spirit. I don't see how the shaking happens if Biden is elected. I only think the shaking can happen if the curtain gets drawn back by Trump. Of course I could be completely wrong.
Yes, I do like her, Tom. Kamala was my first choice in the primaries. And I don't see Joe Biden running for a second term, given his age. So a strong VP will make for a very positive handoff in the 2024 elections.
Translation: It’s about taking away local control. And Biden wants to add taking away “road funding” if you don’t fall in line with the extra layer of Fed Government.  Watch the 1 hour show that explains all of this, in detailed form. Then get back to us.
-Epic- 😆  Biden’s Gonna Lose To 45  Turn it up man...
Says the media 24/7. Step outside the box. It’s nice out here. Policy, agenda, laws more important in todays environment. Biden will let all those who tried to be President, and were rejected, step up and take over. He flip flops on everything these days. Trump never changed.
Yep! Oregun! I don’t see any political Biden signs. Maybe be a good thing? But I don’t see #MAGA hats, signs or bumper stickers either. For me, I’m too afraid my car will get trashed in this CA-mini, home of anarchists state.
Did Trump and his crew of big brains think why we had troops there? Joint Chiefs can’t wait for Biden
Yeah but companies have been trying to dismantle it for over a decade now.  Because our suffering would be their profit
Biden allies move to stop Kamala Harris from becoming vice president they  question her loyalty to the former vice president. Some also argue that she’s too ambitious and that she will be solely focused on eventually becoming president.
Qunatic Fringe, we all know you're out there...  &amp; we pray for your wake up, enlightenment, &amp; liberation of your poor cult gas-lit souls, b/c Jesus would NOT abide w/your 'false idolatry' of sick twisted malevolent narcissist heathen DJ Trump, or MAGA. God Bless &amp; Heaven Help You
Can we just cut to the "smear campaign is b.s." part? Of course there are bones to pick with her record. She's a politician at the highest levels. "Make sure we know a sista has issues." She's going to stand next to Biden- help him win- and she's the one who falls short? Stop it!
Ha ha ha Obama and Biden poured money into fracking.  Check out Obama first speech as president.
If she isn’t chosen as VP, Biden should choose her to head the VA.
Are you kidding me?! The man who spent his career trying to become president- at the cusp of triumph- is surrounded by people who would cut off their noses to spite a Black woman??  When Biden was brought to the White House by a Black man!! If you Democrats don't get it together-
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
It's real and it's honest but it's being made by more or less rando supporters of Biden, not the campaign itself.
Putin and Oligarchs don’t know what sanctions are. Wait until President Biden nails their asses.
Does a single vote for Biden count for Biden only, or does it cover his caregiver as well?
Why aren't Dems signing people up for mail ballots? Mail works for covid, Trumps storm troopers, everything Made my bet March 10 Biden wins primary, loses general
They'r already coming for the socialists in Portland. Biden isn't speaking out, and you centrists are too preoccupied with kissing his ass to even pressure him. Show some fucking solidarity — you're already doing exactly what you're accusing #NeverBiden voters of planning to do.
Biden is very capable!! Much more than your daddy!   So, STOP with the false remarks!!  You got shut down for 10 hours for lying, like your daddy!!   Karma sucks, doesn’t it?
It’s always fun when an older lady tells you on Facebook how inappropriate Biden is when comparing Trump, like are you fucking brain dead? Seriously.
Biden’s campaign has been very competent since he secured the nomination. Letting a member of the VP selection committee talk about the process seems really suspicious.
I trust Biden to pick a good VP and if it’s Kamala Harris- all the better, she’s young enough to give us 8 years as President after Biden.
Like do we seriously fucking think they let a bunch of people including Chris Dodd just blab to reporters??? Less than a week away from Biden's original deadline????
That is what we want in a VP candidate this time around though, right? Biden is not young. He is one and done. VP needs to be a strong candidate in their (her) own
Of course. I can’t lower myself to be so hateful that I can’t help someone.  But I may sneak a Vote Biden sticker on one trunk.
Independent, actually. But I'll gladly vote for Biden because the sociopath in the White House now is doing nothing but destroying this country. And the people still supporting him, they are the ones u should be worried about.
Okay, okay, so, HERE'S A THEORY: This is our red herring from the Biden campaign. They let it leak that some are upset about Harris which leads people into thinking she'll be the pick; when it's actually going to be EW, and this is designed so it catches everyone by surprise.
Why is the Senate a white supremacist organization led by grand wizard McConnell? Why? Who benefits from harming everyone in this country but the handful of privileged fucks most resembling dog food in suits? Has Joe Biden addressed any of this? If so, which part?
I don’t want someone who is “loyal” to Biden. I want someone who will challenge the hell out of him and hold him accountable. The president is not a fucking king. If Biden wants any leftists to give a shit about him outside of “not being trump” then he needs to challenge himself
Antifa wants Biden because fascists want trump.
This is like the emperor's new clothes for them. They can't admit that Biden has dimentia, so to deflect from the obvious they go on the counter-offensive, with the clear logic that Biden couldn't have mental issues since (they say) Trump does. Are liberals really this deluded?
Maybe Dr. Jill Biden will have some ideas on how to do that. Cuz we definitely know that  doesn't. Oh, and BTW, #NobodyLikesTrump
Are you seriously going to tell me that Joe Biden would choose a cop as a VP with all of this - waves hands around at everything - going on? Hmmm...well, now that you mention it, that sounds about right.
Not hating on just Joe Biden, cause there are a lot of morons in government who do the same thing
Excellent  description of the plot starring Joe Biden.  The list of goons crawling into the White House on his coattails is positively gruesome.
What does Fox News have to do with the fact Kamala is lying? It’s easy to look up what her and Biden are peddling. But will you? Or will you just read headliners and smears?
you may be surprised, I read that Biden is not polling well in parts of south Texas cause the immigrants are more  opposed to open immigration policies---the new ones compete with the old ones for jobs. Once again it is the white liberals saving people who don't want to be saved
Do Biden's wrongs negate Trump's?  Trump administration to sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, birthplace of radical Wahhabism.  And Osama bin Laden.  And MOST 9/11 highjackers.

Biden is the worst choice for President I actually like mayor Pete but I’m voting for Trump
And you Leslie will live the dream. Look at Russia, Cuba, Venzuela. Read about Stalin. The Bolsheviks. Power to the people dissolves the minute the power hungry people r in control. Look around babe. U are seeing riots permission of Biden and his weakness to say no to anarchists.

When you vote for Biden you are voting for racist socialists who will destroy the country.
Your sign has real legs &amp; fancy Biden-Blue boots to boot! lol
I am more and more grateful for this woman each day.  From the article: "'If the ultimate goal is to get rid of Donald Trump, that doesn’t have to involve me actually endorsing Biden,' she continued."
K lol I dare you to quote tweet this at me in 2022 (if Biden is president)
If Hillary is vp and Biden wins, 2 to 6 months and Biden will be suicided!
Like I said, Biden is favored this year but only because the national environment is so good for Dems. In 2022 it will not be so (unless Trump somehow wins then it’s an easy flip).
Biden, Who ! ??
Tucker: Joe Biden's VP pick will be the most consequential in history  via
Biden is up because the generic ballot is almost D+9 lmfao. And he still may not end up winning NC, though he is favored atm. R+6-7 would be a fairly average midterm for the outparty, smaller than 2018’s advantage for Dems.
Biden may be trash on many, many, many levels, but just like with Hillary, neither of them are even remotely comparable to Trump. Not even close to the same level. I would definitely have preferred many other people over Biden, but this is where we are now.
Who are Biden’s allies?
Holy shit,  you sided with the fascists. As President, you're going to need educate yourself *before* you talk.
Yeah. I’m hoping Abrams because I think she’s the most realistic of who I’d be excited about that Biden might actually pick. Though maybe I’m overly pessimistic about him trying to excite the left wing of the party.
Only a matter of time before Trump gets Covid. Getting tested daily doesn’t protect you, dotard. Being surrounded by un-masked GOP lackeys, don’t like yer odds. Biden 2020!
Biden's brain is tapioca
Please lord and lady let it be a Biden/Abrams ticket.   I really have no desire to cast a ballot for both Biden and Harris. I will, but I’m not gunna like it.
I respect you Mark, but I am so amazed that you would actually vote for Biden instead of Trump. Knowing what you do about the economy, about free enterprise, I can only assume that it's very very personal for you.
Are you at all concerned when voters announce that they're still going to vote for you over Biden? (Love to you both!)
I'm Joe Biden and I didn't write this tweet.
No couldn’t be. Not China. BIDEN AND THE DEMS LOVE CHINA
Yep. They will kill us all. We have the killers up to the government of USA. Obama/biden surprise 💥
See what reporters spotted on Biden's handwritten notes
We don’t want another Dear Leader suck up Vice President. We want a Vice President who is intelligent compassionate and will voice her opinion. That’s what Biden was for Obama. That’s what whomever Biden picks will be for him.
Read this article through... making sense, especially when you read around the polling groups 😳👀
If Biden were to win, NEVER! The Left would hijack his presidency and shove their bull shit down our throats. No VP would matter, they're insane, anti-American Communist trash. Anyone voting for this crap is not a true American. Prove me wrong
Thought Obama and Biden didn’t know anything about it.

I love how the GOP shows footage of the rioting that is happening now and threatens that is what will happen if Biden wins.  The GOP truly has no shame. But I guess when your base is so stupid, you can tell them anything.
Biden could announce he's selecting a ham sandwich for VP and I'd still vote for him.  I'm so done with the endless "Who do you want Biden to pick?" tweets...  Or the "if he doesn't pick XXXX I won't vote." blackmail support.   My opinion doesn't matter.Beijing Biden saw no danger whatsoever in the CHINA virus.  He called President Trump a xenophobe for barring our doors to China. It is a well known fact that Biden is nothing more than a puppet to the Left
Joe Biden surely has no balls. Bernie and Aoc are President and vp in abstentia. God save us all

Why would Biden pick Harris from . . . California? A state he will win even if he argues in favor of alien DNA as sprinkles on his cupcakes? Politically that makes about as much sense as tapping a running mate from Alaska.
We can ONLY HOPE it turns blue. IF THAT WOULD HAPPEN, that would just about do it, with California, NY, and, HOPEFULLY, Penn, Mich, Minn, and Wis.  Biden probably wouldn’t need much more. BUT,  unlike the a**hole there NOW, Biden WOULDN’T JUST CATER TO THOSE WHO ELECTED HIM.
Fascinating. In Granville's zip, Trump has 70 donors, Biden 111; Newark's zip has 219 for Trump, 157 for Biden. Neither is much over 60% to the leader (59 &amp; 61%), but anecdotally you'd think it was a much larger margin in either.
Maybe Biden is just a Puppet!
We desperately need to overhaul the two party system, but first we have to see Biden as the fire department. Get him in there to put out the fire, then you can call the electrician.

There's an enormous disconnect bordering on cognitive dissonance between one of the major primary progressive/left issue of $ in politics, Biden's corp connections, the Dem response to the pandemic exposed crises, Biden's platform and the prospective VP impact on policy.
A more apt comparison is with Bernie, who's older but very sharp and fit. (Sigh.) And Biden never was very sharp.

I know it's just one poll, but people should be prepared for this thing to get tighter as the election gets closer. It's nothing against Biden, nor is it saying Trump is doing something well, but that's just how it always goes. Polls always tighten up as time ticks away.

Not too sure about Americans you never know they might just be dumb enough to elect Biden as president so he can go over there and give everything away again Democrats are for sale vote trump in November
So jpm conference call says 85% chance basement #Biden will win - seems I recall it was 96% #crookedHillary was going to win. Sounds like good news  #winning   again #FridayFeeling I was raised to kneel in church not to any fake communist ideas against #USA
Trying to get Biden elected at John Lewis' funeral is disgraceful.
It #JimCrowJoe Biden was president, you would have gotten to see him get it wrong.
Fact check:Biden didn't kneel upon seeing flag on Scranton visit    shows a nearby house did have an American flag hanging, Biden’s attention was not on the house or flag, but the conversation he was having with the child #FakeNews
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden
Imagine supporting Biden
Imagine supporting Biden
If i supported a pedophile i would be supporting biden who is also a racist
Not too happy to be retweeting Eric Trump but I will be giving Biden the benefit of the doubt and say this was an honest mistake?! Reality is: I AM CONCERNED with Biden’s health and preparedness to be president.
It’s time for you and your brother to speak out and say you are voting for  Many people still respect you and your brother. Plus, we all know Barr would vote for Biden.
Wouldn't it be a cool idea to let Biden announce a running mate first? Just saying....
That’s your opinion. For people without health insurance, Obama did a lot. That doesn’t matter. We can have Trump who is casually racist, or Biden who is closet racist, but is at least listening to the far left. Don’t forget who BEGGED for those crime bills...it was us (blacks)🤷🏾‍♂️
Hillary was supposedly “up” the entire election cycle... I don’t buy Biden being up.
Here here!! 👏  it takes great courage to admit misjudgment &amp; change.  Welcome Mr Pereira! We must stand for a fair election!              I am counting on Joe Biden to be a fair and just leader for ALL Americans!  His voice is NOT for sale!
Biden promises not to post cringe
It was ok to attend this because it’s a rally for Joe Biden voters, much like the ones in Portland, Seattle, Chicago, DC, etc.
Folks, it STILL works! If you want to have a lil fun, go make yourself some Biden Memes Courtesy of the Biden Campaign. I JUST made this one for example. It’s easy!
Had Biden ever done anything that isn’t a disaster?  Not just within the last year, but at anytime?   His entire career has been a complete failure.
i STILL think joe biden died
Would would you consider a "reasonable" thing one could say about the 5,000-time criminal running against Biden?

Bernie has lost his damn mind. He apparently told his delegates to give up on every single thing they asked for. I have no idea why he's thanking the Biden campaign or pretending that the Platform reflects "the will of the people"
They're gonna go hard in Ohio 🥺 but I'm already seeing Biden signs in the same spots I was trying Trump ones in 2016 so I'm optimistic
I'm sorry but I have spoken with people having just come out of a literal coma who have had more lucidity than Joseph Biden has in his scripted, edited commercials
I said that a week ago.  I'm sure it is Biden's peak
When it comes time for the presidential debate, Biden will mysteriously come down with Covid 19 &amp; be forced to quarantine until the election.   Posting for documentation purposes.
Driving home from my daughters soccer practice and saw THE best politic yard sign...                                    BIDEN                                                    He won’t inject you with bleach  🙌🏻

Trader Joe’s sounds like a Trump nickname for Joe Biden.
They’re so mad the 5 years of primary fights involving Bernie are over. Biden is Teflon, so they’re attacking the most likely VP pick now out of desperation. But the hive has receipts. They will be stung to political death.
Trump just stopped low income housing from being developed in stable suburban communities. Biden sucks, he’s a terrible option, but he doesn’t empower racist. Trump does, Biden is the lesser evil.

Joe Biden can only pick 1 running mate. No matter who he picks, it's not going to be everybody's 1st choice. We can't turn on him if our choice isn't the one. Nothing is more important than getting the most racist, bigoted president of modern times out of the white house.
I think many leftists (myself included) would be surprised to learn we are being "embraced" by Biden lol
The Dems that questioned Barr were amazing asked him important questions that we as Americans want the answers to.  The Reps were a disgrace &amp; refused to try in any way to find out pertinent information that the voters want.  I’m conservative (voting for Biden) and feel this way!
This is awesome!  I thought I was going all Biden and my memory was messed up.  It did happen the way I remember it.  Tricky how they try to erase history.  Erasing it because a lot of evil and criminal stuff
Your brother was going to vote for Biden, you know.
Sad you think Biden isn’t racist, the whole democratic party was founded by racists. When did race even come up? You brought that shit it
And this is their Democratic pick ??👇Joe Biden declines invitation to sit for Fox News interview
That’s easy. Biden’s not a danger to our country. Trump’s taken our country in a dangerous direction &amp; it’s going to take a good long time and a lot of work by future presidents to undo the damage Trump has done to this country.  We need someone that will unite &amp;heal the country.
You taking about Biden? I’m not sure he remembers exactly what he cares about. You do know trump has given the most money ever to historically black colleges right? Did you cash the stimulus check? You know who gave that to you right? or are you gonna say you didn’t cash it?
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Ohio Build Back Better Roundtable with Congresswoman Marcia Fudge” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
You can’t blame Biden without blaming the support and money from the left. Joe Biden is only a symptom of the disease with the Democratic Party at this point...
I remember when Bernie supporters spread a fake rape story about Biden. Not once but twice. Also harrased union members with death threats. Let's not forget the constant harassment of Neera Tanden.
In which country? Because we it’s not going to be the USA  Unless, of course, you are now backing Biden who will win bigly
Yo  is there a place I can get a yard sign for your campaign? And does anyone know where I get a Biden one? Or any other Ohio dem? I need me a yard sign
I would vote for a chimpanzee if he were running against Trump. Joe Biden is a good man. Vote Biden. Defeat Trump

Just don't take it personal when Biden bytch slaps your boy...😂😂 on a different note how are you guys doing there
Any Biden administration priorities ($15/hr min wage, DC + PR admission, H.R. 1) is DOA in the Senate if they don't kill the filibuster.
Ari, have you apologized to Joe Biden and your followers yet?
yes. we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. get out and do whatever you can to get biden elected
One aspect of strong polarization is that people's beliefs about the news are driven by their beliefs about the parties, rather than vice versa.   Biden's been leading Trump by 8-10 pts for over 3 months now. At some point, people's opinions get burned in and won't be changeable.
We’re Obama and Biden in the planning stages of helping inner city neighborhoods for 8 years? Nothing was done. No one got help. What is their excuse?!
A nice start to a policy agenda for Biden. Add a climate change initiative that cleans up all the damage done (and then some), working toward Medicare for all and free daycare, etc, etc...
Yes, "WE" Biden supporters will win BIG! Thank you for acknowledging this. Your starting to wake up🤣.
Always love his speeches!!!!! I wish he was back!!! Thank God for Joe Biden!!!!!!🙏🏻🙏🏻👏👏
"Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason." So Olsen said then that this is treason. What does he think about it now?
It's amazing that you have so little self-respect, and that you're willing to trample your own integrity in the gutter rather than apologize to Joe Biden and your readers.
This is an important note  "Biden’s 10% lead has remained relatively stable since our first swing state voting intention in May.[1]"
Biden better win big, because this country will tear itself apart if this happens.
Trump's lead narrows, Biden is declared winner in a number of states when its certified. Trump protests, Republicans protest and say Dems cheated, lawsuits are filed, and the Supreme Court has to rule on whether ballots should be counted after election day.
The problem is that 35-40% of the country that's his hardcore base.  If they just stomp their feet and say Biden's "not my president," so be it.  But, if these folks want to start "exercising their 2nd Amendment rights" at boards of elections, statehouses, etc., we have a mess.
I've long debated whether creating a cabinet department to address climate, as this post proposes, was the right approach. I'm still unconvinced.
And this is exactly what Joe Biden’s administration will do right off the bat
Weren't you the one  back in April who retweeted an article that Joe Biden suggesting this would happen was a conspiracy theory?Yeah that is straight up sexism but it’s not Biden driving it. I wish he’d announced already but there’s been torrents of bad news about trump so I’m willing they’re holding back to keep the light on Trump’s failures.
I don't know, how is the Joe Biden sexual assault case going?
Wow Biden must be powerful to have made a world wide pandemic. Don't you think?
Ohio Democratic Virtual Convention (tomorrow at 4:30 pm) is being attended by Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and a few others. Special announcement by Biden will be made. Odds are, it’ll be him announcing Kamala as his VP pick.
If VP Biden picks a black woman as his VP pick and she ends up being President. She is going to catch hell from the "right" more than President Obama ever did. SMDH
Have you even listened to Biden lately? Do you find him to be well spoken? I mean now, btw. Not in 1971 when he first joined the swamp.
Trump will destroy this country with what little time he has left. Just to spite the fact that Biden is beating him. Trump can not stand to loose.
But you’re still voting for Biden, right? He can’t put a complete thought together at this point. 😂
No worries. With Biden up by 15, they’ll be calling it at 9:30 EST.
Bernie dropped out April 8th.... then endorsed Biden.
They aren’t campaigning for Biden. They’re campaigning for their agenda of which Biden is the puppet.
I’d vote for Biden no matter who the VP choice is. Just my 2 cents worth...#TrumpThreatensAmerica
We want Biden to win. He can do that with either as VP.
I bet Mr. Biden will need to change his Depends during the debate break
Particularly since he recently called out Biden for warning that Trump would do exactly this.
Agree there are many good candidates, though just like the election that put this idiot in the the white house, a vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump. We have to trust &amp; believe that since Biden has been in the front seat before he will listen &amp; hear his advisors .
Well the way I see it is we already have a racist president who is also a idiot,  so just like Trump asked us black people,  what do I have to lose voting for Biden? I'm voting in person so it doesn't matter.
In my personal opinion, (no one on any podcast I've heard has said anything like this) Joe Biden is dragging out his VP nomination in order to platform neo-liberal black women, while actual progressive black women like Nina Turner are not being platformed
Pathetic, as to be expected from Hidin Biden
You have to bundle them all together-but you cannot explain Joe Biden talking about his leg hairs and how they turn blonde in the sun.  What is he talking about?  I would not want to vote for that
Since this is Rasmussen, it’s more likely Biden + 11
If Biden negates fracking, will PA and OH turn RED...?
Amen, Brit.  Also, do the Democrats really think that all the protests and violence will magically disappear if Biden is elected?  The treatment of Mr. Barr was one of the lowest points on American politics.
Welcome to Ohio. Remember 4.29 under Obama #Biden ?  #Biden2020 ??? No thank you.
I’m soooooo scared of the threats made by you and the president regarding Biden that I’ll have to vote for Trump. DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE BELIEVES YOUR BULLSHIT? IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?
It was a strategic move by the speech writer and comms team. If he starts joking, he has cover for times lost. I AM a Bernie VOTER not Becky. I will not be voting for Trump, and my voice matters Biden Bullies!
Oh I’m voting Trump 2020. F**k Hidin Biden. His sheep either need to wake up and #WalkAway or they’re forever lost.

This "video" he's showing is as bad as the trump video ad that keeps talking about "Biden's America" that's LITERALLY what's happening DUE TO TRUMP... jfc this is sickening
. U.S. Intelligence Officers were HEROES to pick up treasonous contact between Trump WH operatives &amp; the Kremlin;  Pres. Obama &amp; VP Biden saved our nation, no doubt, by following through with the investigation.
I love the job he is doing, love the person,  the persona, the work ethic,  the whole family, the tweets, all of it. He is in the top 5 Presidents ever, and the only one for the job now. Biden, all other comers are like " fake candidates " when compared to My

I back Harris but I can see plausible reasons not to pick her. If Biden doesn’t, I’d bet on something coming up during vetting that could be a distraction, though.
Biden campaign knows he's such a liability when he talks its a smarter plan to just keep him quite the hole campaign and just see what happens at election time
Yep! Which is why we need four more years or else we get Biden - the extension of Obozo
Ummm, Biden never stared at the sun. He also never mentioned ingesting disinfectant to stop COVID.  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
even sweep them all if current projections don't change too much. If Biden wins them all? We're talking a Clinton vs Dole type of defeat, if not worse. But we can't get happy. We must fight like we're ten points down everyday. #NoMercy #CrushTrump #Biden2020 #BidenLandslide2020
This right here. Folks are simply exhausted by him and simply want him gone. He's losing PA, WI, MI, FL, AZ, and it's basically neck and neck in OH, NC, and TEXAS. As long as Biden wins everything that Hillary won and takes any combo of those three, it's all over. Hell Biden may
It's never been called the Democrat Party, ahole. It's the Democratic Party.   If the Democratic Party was full of Marxists, do you think Joe Biden would be the nominee? Regardless, I'd rather be called a Marxist and it be pure bs than to be called a fascist and it be true. 🤷‍♂️
Nobody cares how Biden voted on the Iraq War. We are four years into the Trump nightmare.  Period.
Biden. PRESIDENT. Warren. Vice President. Trump. Landslide. Defeat.   Repeat that back to me.
Love the message but the context is contradicting:  #100DaysToGo until when? We vote for another "politician"?  How can this be the most important election of our lives if "we have no choice"  Biden is part of the "club"
Biden blames you to. For doing nothing. Before pointing the finger what where you doing in Febuary. I know a rally and golfing right.
Inhaling too much radon in the basement, Joe Biden...?
I'm not even going back and forth with him anymore. He's the same guy who said Biden would be just as bad as Trump. 😂
I wish all of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Go into the basement with your pal Biden.Perfect place for the both of you.
No, I can’t imagine exalting Joe Biden
Standing up for our country and standing against a communist group is what’s important. And no, Brady isn’t a racist like Joe Biden.
I'm thinking closed till election then if biden gets the win he will miraculously cure covid AND stop all the rioting in a single day!
lol even tho joe biden has vowed to veto medicare4all, if he would jus pretend to support it hes got my vote haha
Joe Biden thinks he is married to Joe Biden sooooo.
Answer:   Trump vs. Biden: Who’s Winning the Money Race in Your ZIP Code?
Empires crumble. This seems like we are maybe even past the tipping point. A “healing” Biden presidency doesn’t put QAnon back in the bottle.
I read the article that your son Eric that was published in America's 1st Freedom magazine.  Others that are not members of the NRA could read the article.  As Americans, we need to pray for you to be re-elected, not Biden.
At 68, that is my goal too. No matter what happens, I will live to vote for Biden.
Also, prepare for Trump to try and claim the result is illegitimate if it's a semi-close Biden win. He'll overblow it all, claiming China rigged it against him, and claim that he should stay in office until the issue is resolved in the courts.

I think it's a mixture of people having an inability/place to have pride in their own lives/line of work and an inherent reliance on Great Man theory in modern unconscious philosophy. It also sort of explains why we're so limited by singular people in politics ie Biden/Trump
Like how can you really seriously say that Biden is not a better candidate than Trump. You don't have to agree with everything Biden's done but he is light years better than what we have in office right now. No one in the right mind would want four more years of Trump.
My husband finally got to see your short video of what will happen under Biden if we lose our police.  He asked if I had seen it and I said yes.
Lol is that all you got? We have the worst outbreak in the world. Trump failed horribly.   If he had simply followed the playbook that Obama and Biden left him, we wouldn't be as bad off.   He failed and 145k are dead, 4+ million infected, and the economy is in ruins.
Ah. Getting Trump ads on TV saying Biden is in favor of defunding police...  I wish he was that cool.  But also trying to scare old people into thinking 911 and emergency dispatch will be shut down.
No I’m talking about the Biden klan.
How are people gonna say “this or that will be Joe Biden’s America” and then post videos of what’s happening literally right now during Trumps administration? Are y’all really that dumb? Yes, yes you are that dumb.
My Democrat city goes to shit, even though it was also shit when Obama was President: blames Trump.  Car hits a squirrel: blames Trump.  Increased smog in Beijing: blames Trump.  Biden says something racist: blames Trump.  Trump restores law and order: blames Trump.  See a theme?
Democrats hope the Householder scandal has the same impact on state races as 'Coingate' had in the 2006 election. Political experts, however, are not sure it'll have any impact.
Polls already indicated Donald Trump has lost support in Ohio, a key state he won by eight percentage points in 2016.
How has Biden been in government 10000 years and doesn't have even a high school grasp on our history?🤦🏽‍♂️New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Majority of Democrats want Biden to pick a Black woman for vice president  Wow so JOE BIDEN NEEDS to pick a woman!!

Lots of people are speculating about Biden's VP pick. Its the hot media clickbait story of the hour. But, as many have pointed out, this take from Politico, which has been echoed by other publication and (mostly white male) pundits is deeply problematic &amp; offensive.
I disagree. ANY change on Trump's part would signal chao. Trading reliable white male Pence for brown, female, openly ambitious Haley would infuriate Trump's base, which is racist &amp; misogynist. This would nail Biden's reelection no matter who his VP is. Pure media fantasy.
And you know this how, sine Biden is playing his cards close to his chest?
No one cares about that shit. Given Biden's age, I'm more concerned with who you're setting up for the future. Politically she's not strong — she has no electoral experience &amp; we have no idea how she'd perform as a candidate.
I don't think anyone knows who Biden will pick &amp; the media is just throwing shit out to see what sticks. Rice is certainly credible &amp; given the nature of the campaign this year, she won't hurt it, but she would be a weak pick for the future.
How does she balance the ticket ideologically? She is probably a a tad more progressive than Biden, but Harris is one of the most progressive members of the Senate. And let's give the idea that Republicans will "use" these phony narratives — they'll invent something for anyone.
Ohio will be blue this year. Former (as of yesterday) Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder handed Ohio to Biden with his arrest last week for taking $61 million in bribes to ram through HB6, to bail out coal &amp; nuclear &amp; kill green energy. Everyone hated it! Now they're reminded!
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election Even with some states too close to call right now, Biden has Trump beaten....
Biden is a chump who uses tax dollars as outsourcing bribes. When not bribing he's extorting ally nations defense funds to fire people he doesn't like.
Duckworth would mirror Biden's personal brand in that they're both people who have suffered great personal losses, but remain committed to and caring of other people.
How can Biden embrace them? He had Dementia
You didn't say it but you did imply it. You think Biden wont get it done. Well nothing is getting done with trump. He actually implied that the election should be "delayed"
Good morning to  and only    "...there are Democrats who are still waiting for the white working class to come back to them. One white guy in Cincinnati is worth more to some Democrats than 100 Black guys in Cleveland."
Trump vs Biden is actually Democrcacy (Biden) vs Fascism (Trump)
also I'm ready to say, like Sherrod, that folks need to vote their conscious on Biden, and I know that a low-rent war hawk abuser is not as bad as a fascist serial rapist, but I'll be damned if folks ever gave Tara Reade a moment before running a bus over #MeToo
I still believe Biden has a chance here.
Your reaching with the Biden deal. It’s a joke. Like this President and administration he controls.
What drugs are you on? Biden’s so called touching of that girl was picked apart by everyone!!! Trumps the rubbing elbows with Stone, Maxwell and JE. Not Biden. Keep reaching bright one!!! Yet to you fucks, this is okay. See Biden didn’t have to pay off anyone. Trump did.
What is your path forward? You have yet to say anything other than vague liberal platitudes that Joe Biden has not or will ever care about.

You wanna investigate Biden while trump over here thinking about postponing the election? What?!
I agree.  I hope Biden selects her.  She is well-spoken, intelligent and a fighter!
The question wasn’t whether Trump would be convicted in court. Rather, the question was around intellectual consistency on the part of  . My guess is he will exhibit none. Don’t understand your statement about Biden’s comments not being a close call?
If you champion Trump you are a clown. If you champion biden you are a clown. Blow the whole system up
According to the WaPo editorial,  believes Biden’s accusation of Trump trying to delay the election is an accusation of treason. Now that Trump has openly talked about delaying the election, does Olsen agree Trump’s tweet was treasonous?
So Vice President Biden is clairvoyant as well. A bonus for the next president of the United States. #VoteHimOut
You haven’t been listening. Nor reading. Biden has put out severa good plans and given many speeches on specific topics. All with reasonable and sound specific on what he would do as president. Maybe go to his website and see for yourself. And follow some Dems who support Biden.
I live in a suburb of Cleveland and have not seen a single Trump yard sign. Biden signs are popping up everywhere. #SuburbsForBiden
I heard that, Biden has one foot in the grave and you have a younger woman who possibly could run the country ? Maybe ?
Joe Biden should let all these leakers go right now because they may well be like trump’s White House. I wonder if them leakers only voted for Biden? Biden/Harris is where we’re.
I think Warren was dropped from the list. I think Biden knows the reality: she's too old &amp; we'd lose her seat. That pretty much obliterates her qualifications.
Well biden sent out im sure😂😂😂
They should be found, arrested, and tried.   - Joe Biden on the protesters who attacked the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse, Portland Oregon
Not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden.
That’s an opinion piece. I’ve read real news articles that say the opposite. As she says: It’s all politics. She’s good and everyone knows it. Some are threatened by strong women. Hope Biden’s not.
Isn’t that the point of Biden limiting himself to one term???

Those executive orders will vanish when Biden takes office. Shouldn't you be planning your exile?
Hopefully Biden will press him on this during the debates.
So Jim Jordan’s nonsense wasn’t an attempt to embarrass and condemn Obama and Biden!?
Waiting waiting waiting waiting to see any sign of Biden in Ohio.
Please join me in advocating for more hearings and passage of my Paid Family Leave bills!  Also, FYI, my very few NO votes on DNC Platform amendments reflect my preference for Biden camp language over Bernie camp. They were not NO votes to the actual policies. Stay tuned🤜🏽🤛🏽💙✊🏽
I don’t get that either! What kind if idiots look at that and say “Oh boy that Biden look what he’s doing. Are they that dumb??
What will you do if Biden wins
So would you leave the country if Biden was elected
committing to burning a Joe Biden sign omw to voting.
Trump will probably not win Ohio. He can thank indicted Oho House Speaker Larry Householder, whose arrest last week probably gifted the state to Joe Biden.
I should thank Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder for gifting the state to Joe Biden last week. Thanks, Larry! Enjoy prison! Maybe I'll send you a card.

He’s probably going to win Florida (Biden). It’s not likely for Trump atm.
She was pitched as a continuation of the Obama admin, she had Obama’s endorsement, Biden has Obama’s endorsement. It’s not a big deal.
Again, enjoy Trump. If the worry is that comments, that have since been apologized for, about a dead guy, are more of a worry than the pandemic we are experiencing, they weren’t voting Biden to begin with.
It was Hillary that didn't give her the job she wanted. She was never up or a job with Biden.
OHIO wants to apologize for 2016! NEVER AGAIN! Biden 2020 OUR VISION IS CLEAR!!!

I live right next to a Jesuit university. My neighborhood is 85% Catholics, mostly Irish. The type who have three kids all in Catholic school, watch Notre Dame games, voting Biden. 4+ generation cradles. The kind of people trads oddly despise.
She was elected to Congress mostly by Black people in Detroit area who voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden and now she’s defying them not to endorse Biden and causing troubles. Can’t stand her and Bernie Sanders, she’s worthless to her constituents. So she deserves to loose.
Does anyone really think Biden's handlers will allow him to debate? Be serious...there will be some excuse.
I guess I am not the only one who will #BeSilentNoLonger First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
Biden doesn't care what he internet thinks because someone somewhere is making a case for ONLY MY CHOICE &amp; slagging all the others.
What's to "prepare"? Everyone who is passionately attached to a single candidate &amp; thinks everyone else sucks should start "preparing." I don't care who but all signs do point to Harris. Biden isn't going to make his pick based on media &amp; internet opinions.
Me too, and Biden signs are everywhere, which is a sign of determination to turn out and vote. And we're one of the most populous counties in Ohio.
My entire city (Ohio) is a field of Biden signs. And we're populous and we vote.
OK, I looked it up. Half before, half after the news broke about the arrest of GOP Ohio House speaker Larry Householder, which is likely going to hand Ohio to Biden. It will shift even more toward Biden as people learn more about his involvement in HB6.
If he said it, he's a misogynist. Kamala said/did nothing wrong: Biden bungled his answer. And all they've done since is pretend it was HER fault.

Actually, Biden's messaging and strategy have been pitch perfect. And Hillary won PEOPLE in a landslide, the only element that can respond to messaging. Biden isn't remotely "right wing." Give it up, Berner.
It’s almost like trump has only positives and Biden has all negatives. Doesn’t sound biased at all

No matter what!!! Donald must go. I think Biden will fit perfectly in office. For the people. I think all Trumpers should be shipped off to Greenland!!! Wait I thought Trump wanted to buy Greenland? I fucking chunk of ice.
Damn trump trying to shut down a public service like USPS. That may be the reason I vote Biden because I don’t want mail to get privatized. Still unsure about Biden tho, still not voting trump at any cost
Biden will be the next.
So fucking what!! Biden has you!!! Bye bye POS!!

Decent people support Biden. Only grifters, fools, fascists, and racists support Trump.
I am worried sick about the direction of this country.  Even if Biden wins, we still have five more months of the goon in the Oval Office.  And who knows what kind of constitutional crisis will emerge when he loses because I guarantee you he won't go gently into that good night!
"The very fabric that holds our nation together — an adherence to human rights and liberty — is at stake this November."  Vote Biden!

The CDC case file lists a cough as clinical coronavirus. You'd think they'd change the case file study definition back to the WHO's 2012 definition when Obama/Biden ignored it. Creating the coronavirus of today, but numbers are numbers. 2012 isn't 2020.

Looking forward to Biden’s being mocked by villains like you for stuttering while speaking coherently and thoughtfully about important matters of state.
Joe Biden is alert and oriented to himself  Trump is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. The choice is between electing a person with dementia or a person without dementia.
Lovecraftian would be Trump’s closet leading to an unspeakable cacophony of GOP monsters circle jerking into a pile of hair from Epstein’s innocents; Pyncheon would be Biden’s closet of bombs exploding banana trees sheltering families from sun at noon, gathering mountain water

Sounds strange. Biden needs a VP who has won statewide and possible 2024 candidate for top job.
Why does Trump continue to ignore Russian treachery? Putin continues to do whatever he wants without any fear of reprisal. The Russians are not our friends! We need a president who will stand up to Putin! VOTE FOR BIDEN!

Good analogy. The analogy I've been thinking of is Biden is an empty vessel for leftists to fill with their radical policy wish list. Also, your son is really smart for 11, or any age for that matter.
Can't answer for all Sanders voters, but I will not be voting forr Biden.
Same feeling among Pakistani, Somalian, Yemeni families when Obama and Biden weren't put to death for war crimes.
Lol. Didnt address my point at all. Because you can't refute the facts, I guess. Biden has been working against poor people his whole career. Not one policy he has would benefit them.
The fact that 34 percent approve is startling.
Neither of us has ANY idea what these 3 could do with exception of Clinton. Why would this effect Hillary? She’s not Bill. No, I don’t think Clinton and Biden are “buddies”. And, if Trump couldn’t bury this, HRC couldn’t. Honesty, no issue. Bill is up to his neck. With Trump.
People are talking when Biden gets in office we'll have tribunals and shit to convict this administration and it won't happen. Biden will say some shit like "more than ever the county needs to heal and come together and put the past behind us"
Yep exactly!
Yeah, because they follow Joe Biden on twitter

It’s under 8 years of Obama that race relations have deteriorated. Biden also.
So, Trump floats an asinine &amp; Illegal idea and you would like us to believe that Biden and those who found it unacceptable are being “absurd” for responding to THE EXACT WORDS the POTUS spoke. Saying NOTHING is ABSURD!  Giving THIS POTUS the benefit of the doubt, dangerous.
That was a very devisive campaign speech. Thank God you're not pres anymore &amp; if you were any kind of friend to Biden you would tell him to give it up
Joe Biden is have a live stream press conference as you read this. Look how many people have joined him
Take the L.  You earned it.  Us liberals would crawl over broken COVID-coated glass shards to end this presidency (in the Constitutionally provided means of an election).  Delay?  DELAY?  Shit, if you think Biden’s going soft you’ve missed that you’ve gone right to porridge.
I agree, and so does Joe Biden. He's already promised to serve one term. His vp pick will be groomed to run in 2024. Hopefully she's a little younger. Not that i wouldn't vote for Warren.

Days or weeks later, all the mail in ballots are counted and it’s enough to secure the win for Biden. But since it’s after the first count, Trump refuses to accept the actual results

It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
Wow, Joe Biden was President for 8 years? When did that happen? What has Mike Pence accomplished over the last 3 years?
Excellent point. It's worth noting the depth and diversity of the 105 D women v 22 R women in Congress. Speaks volumes. Biden has an amazing field of candidates which should be celebrated as a positive point of differentiation rather than an excuse to take sides.
you do realize tho that this all happening during Trumps presidency, right? Like this isn’t what will happen if Biden becomes presidents because it’s already happening under Trump....

If I was a Biden advisor, there’s 4 names I would push as solid choices on both electoral and governing scales.   1.   2.   3.   4.    2 with significant strengths and risks: 1.   2.
She responded by focusing on specific neighborhoods and housing complexes, and during her tenure, violent crime fell by 40 percent. Val Demings Is on Biden’s V.P. List. Will Her Police Career Hurt or Help?
Biden is smart to move left. He's got to energize progressives, but I think he'd govern as a centrist.
If white people are the only racist, as the Mentally Ill (D) want you to believe) why don’t we have WET (White Entertainment Television) or a month deadicated to Joe Biden (real racist) or a college fund/colleges for only white people, tearing down statues of Martian Luther King?
Donated to Trump again.  Biden is starting to scare me policy wise.  He's going far left.  I support some type of government health care though.  Opposed to school choice.

Biden has a stutter. Trump is lacking a healthy brain. That is the difference.
Plus, word out of the WH has been that Biden or Harris were the candidates he was most concerned about. I think we need to give him a two-fer!
Sure.  Trump is actively trying to kill our planet and Biden will do nothing about it.  We need a Green New Deal and progress.  Inactivity is just as damning as hurting the environment at this point.
I hate to inform you on this one, but Biden hates socialism too.
I see. So THESE polls matter. The ones showing Biden up don’t.
Unfortunately Biden is no better because he says Carbon Neutral by 2050.  We're screwed either way on this.
You mean the systemic racism that’s been around the last 40 years Biden, Pelosi, Waters and Nadler have been writing policy?
Me too and a flag!! There’s like one joe Biden sign on my street. I want them to be out one day when I bike by so I can ask why they are voting for him. I’m really curious.
Again, this is already happening NOW under Trump. And as much as you want to believe 45's false claim, Biden does not support defunding the police. That has been addressed for like a month now.
It’s fake news that he said that bucko! But as a pans, matching Biden sausages in the oval would be good for America.
It's beyond me, really, that purity politics can be a thing right now. I don't understand why some would rather see Trump get a second term than have Biden who, while not as progressive as desired, would be far more so than Trump. It just doesn't seem pragmatic to me at all.
"Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle" -Biden

That's what they want right???????  No more police Biden
In my own opinion, it’s going to be the same outcome whether you vote for Trump, Biden, or Kanye.

Nope not one bit. I have a preference but I  can avidly support Biden no matter who he chooses.
Surreal. I agree more with Joe Biden's public position on covid19 vaccines than President Trump's, even though in reality Biden doesn't give a sh*t about vaccine safety. He's just trying to score political points as always.

Biden’s gotta clean this up. 1. The term “anarchist” is being used by Trump to demonize protestors. 2. There are people with legitimate anarchist political beliefs that have committed no crime.

Trump knows he’s wrong for having that commercial with somebody breaking in that old lady’s home talking about “Joe Biden’s America will not be safe because he calls for defunding the police”. He didn’t even say that.

I'm sorry..but this video theatrical of Gym Jordan's is making a better case for Biden #TrumpsAmerica
Seeing a lot of Gleeks say Will would vote for Trump but he wasn’t openly bigoted, just extremely out of touch so he probably loved Biden from the start. He has a bit of a white savior complex, is posting about hating looting/“not all cops”, &amp; he denied allegations against Biden.
I admit, I was shocked to see Karen Bass' name as a VP candidate, but she has a lot of experience. I disagree w/ Sunny on VP picks. Most presidential nominees choose VPs that won't outshine them. McCain made that mistake w/ Palin. Pres. Obama didn't when he chose Biden. #TheView

RUSH: I&amp;#039;ve had a couple emails from people asking, &amp;#34;Hey, Rush, what do you think about this projection that Trump is gonna lose everything?&amp;#34;
Who brought up Trump or Biden? Are you following along with this conversation or just throwing in bullshit statements?
Are people being serious thinking the rioters and looters are Trump supporters, I read all sorts of comments saying this. Were these people born without a brain, if its Trump supporters explain why democrats are bailing these people out, including Joe Biden. Wake up liberals.
I agree. Joe Biden would not stand a chance it he had to keep coherent thoughts in his head for over an hour and go toe to toe with President Trump.
White people clearing out like damn we can’t even come here anymore lmao.... they’ll prob still vote Biden though
I think it’s nice Melania is fixing up the place for the Biden’s.
I think it’s nice that she is fixing up the Rose Garden for the Biden’s.
So we can expect the "it was Bush's fault rule", if Biden wins?
If Trump and his goons are going to intimidate the vote, the Biden and the Dems need to work with the (Jimmy) Carter Center to monitor the poll workers and the Storm Troopers.  Fair is fair.
Literally together? Like, as in you and Biden, together, on a ticket?   Yes.
I’m attending Joe Biden for President’s event, “Make Calls Into Florida” – sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
Hidin Biden has to come out in the real world sometime. Scared to announce his VP, debate, and now this. Maybe he'd feel more comfy if we brought in one of his Chinese or Ukrainian buddies to be his spokesman?
Yeah, because Biden is so much like BLM people.
Definitely, I'm not enthused about Biden at all, but I will definitely vote for him against this madman.
That is because the Biden campaign is about substance and the Trump campaign is about...boat parades?
Read the article and laugh. She says she is wearing the Swastika flag as a mask because if Biden wins we are going to be a socialist country? Hitler was a socialist? Minnesota couple banned from Walmart after wearing Nazi flags as face coverings
Obama and Biden put people in cages.
Ah yes, she’ll help Biden get past his “you ain’t black” comment.
Just contradicted your own argument, genius. Biden Bros aren't terribly smart, are they.
Bite a dick...marry your brother...become Biden’s basement dweller... I mean the options are endless
Does the democrat party hates single family homes?
Biden and Dems Are Set to Abolish the Suburbs
Settle for Biden is definitely the most humor I’ve ever gotten out of politics
Trump likes to say things like “this would be Biden’s America...” and show images like this.  This is 2020 and DJT is still the President.  This is...
His name was Bernell Trammell. He was murdered for being a black Trump supporter. Where’s the outrage? Where’s the #FakeNewsMedia here? Sharpton? Jackson? Biden? Any #PeacefulProtest for him? RIP. #BernellTrammell #BLM #ABLM
Vote Biden!! And vote blue Senate!! Gotta get Mitch out and repair the damage Trump has done!
Yeah I have. He's still better than Biden.
I think Soros is starting to develop dementia like Biden. "Trump will disappear in 2020 or even sooner."
Yeah I voted for bernie in the primaries but Biden’s moved left quite a bit since then. Definitely settling but he’ll still be so much better than what we’ve gotten the past 4 years
Biden does give off creepy grandpa vibes at times but I don’t think it really rises to pedophilia. But yeah that argument is immediately moot when their president wishes maxwell, child sex trafficker, “the best”
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
This election is gonna suck cuz I don’t like Trump or Biden 🤷‍♂️

he’s not gonna sway trump supporters. he’s only taking votes away from Biden and he knows it. we got Trump til 2025
i just got a trump ad on hulu. which 1 is funny considering the things i watch. and 2 the ad itself was hilarious. this lady tried calling 911 because apparently biden wants to get rid of 911 by defunding the police
At this point I think I can probably beat Biden.....
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Joe Biden charged the secret service to rent his guest house when he was VP.  I guess that is ok.
Not voting for Biden. The man has spent 50 years in politics voting for policies that harm working people. #NeverBiden
Yea ye Biden and Trump lol niggas playing wit are lives
Just realized the guy I'm hooking up with hasnt hit me up since he pleaded to me to vote for biden and I rejected his harm reductionist argument. I thought it was a lovely convo, but havent heard from him since.
Ion think that nigga like Biden tho lol
Ohio needs help, the only ad I see is a fear mongering Trump ad, where he tries to scare the sh*t out of old people about Biden defunding police.  I have seen NO other ads here, no anti-Trump ads, no pro-Biden ads. Ohio needs to see a counter ad to this horrid ad....
Biden has yet to be honest or have real interviews with non editing of questions. Instead hides behind his wifes skirts.
You're gonna beat off Biden?
The only thing that can end this pandemic is to elect Joe Biden. If he wins, it all goes away. If Trump wins, the virus stays. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #Trump2020 #KAG2020 #Scamdemic #FakeNewsMedia
Yep. I'm voting for Joe Biden. Trump has committed Election Fraud, Treason, Crimes Against Humanity And others.
Biden’s victims?  ONE accuser. The other circulating pics were HIS OWN GRANDAUGHTER. Surprise, grandfathers often hug their granddaughters!  You ‘be been had. And, since we’ve been given the choice of Biden and the pussy-grabber, I’ll take Biden. You can have the pussy-grabber.
Radio Host Charlamagne Tells Joe Biden To 'Shut the F*** Up Forever' After Latest Gaffe
Has the Democratic Party changed? In the last 50 years? Has Biden changed? Look at Biden’s record? Democrats are a party of slavery, confederacy, murdered Kennedy, murdered Martin Luther King, party of hate. Supporters of Radical Left/socialists/communists/fascist/Marxists/antifa
Bernie you should be chosen to be Biden’s vice president. Then we would have two stupid pathetic old men running against trump! You’re so focused on a socialist left wing war against success that you’ve become blinded to the generosity of the “billionaire elites” you so despise!
Thank goodness she didn’t have her underage granddaughter with her he would have turned into a Pervy old blood hound and this would have been a different video. Biden and trump are both creeps.
Charlamagne runs his mouth calling our president racist without offering up reasons as to how he’s racist. Why don’t you actually educate yourself in Biden’s past and all the racist shit he’s said and done. Trump has done more for minorities than Biden has in 50 yrs.
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
If Biden wins, any potential convictions, let alone indictments, will get a pardon regardless. Much about nothing at that point
Funny, I had 2 diehard Trump supporters tell me that they are voting for Biden.
That is Donald Trump’s America, they are proudly displaying it for some reason? I’m guessing without a longer video, blaming Obama or Biden or both
Biden has to be nominated
Virus gonna go away after the election like it has gone down in every other country, media just running with it for now. They will use anything they can against Trump lol. If you rather see Biden in the warehouse that's scary. Dude can barely even say what hes trying to say
Poll of who they think next president will be should acccompany it.   I bet the 20% who say NO also think Joe Biden wins the election.  Thus they think Joe Biden is going to implode the country in the next 8 years ?     This country will persevere
You must really love Biden and his "selfless leadership" to not even suggest a convention during this Pandemic.
I know Trump wanted Biden to take one but didn’t hear Fauci was asked to do it and Biden would ace it! Biden stuttered real bad as a child .. he did speech therapy and it fixed it.. but when he gets excited or nervous or mad.. he still has a bit of a stutter!
breh Imagine if this is the map with a blue AZ and blue FL (realistic if not likely) plus NC (realistic) plus if Texas and GA (possible) are legit in play then the Biden uber blowout is possible  I actually think MI WI shouldnt be blue quite yet maybe FL should though along w/AZ
take the lead now President Biden before he kills us all. I'm concerned about my grands and great grands
Some of the most interesting things to look at are the  Obama-Obama-Trump Counties in swing states.   I feel that turnout in predominantly blue districts will be better, but it's still important to  evaluate how Biden will perform v Trump in Swing states.
This is what we need to elect Joe Biden to STOP! #ByeDon2020 Take your illegal Gestapo with you!
This is joe Biden’s America folks, we can’t do shit but terrorists get free reign
JOE BIDEN withdraws from POTUS race as 'October Surprise," receives the diminished national award given erroneously by Obama to Ted Kennedy, endorses the real candidate all along, Hillary Clinton, thus returning Bill to the White House, &amp; has DOJ cancel charges.
George Will agrees.
If 'polls' are strong enough favoring Biden, look for him to drop-out at last minute. His 'presumptive' nomination is only 4 TIME to DECIDE UPON BEST V.P. for the 'real' candidate, AND ONLY if 'polls' are strong enough: Hilary Clinton, along with A male Black V.P
Poll Question: “Do you support our hero Donald Trump or that stinky Joe Biden?”

He had 40 years and what has he done with it? That is a Joe Biden Jab. #JoeBidenJob
Sure..right after we swear President Biden in😅👠
I know your revenue comes from ads, but Trump’s horrible &amp; fear mongering ad with the old lady about to be robbed in Biden’s America is just plain offensive and despicable.  I feel like I’ve seen it 100 times, enough, you are doing a disservice to elderly Ohioan’s!

Biden isn’t President....no worries.
It’s Biden Time!  #Biden2020
I will vote for Biden!!
Now do Biden!!!
Me too! Biden is smart and has coherent thoughts, unlike that man you support.
I don't want to presume what people think, but as a public librarian for 20 years I feel safe to say that most Americans don't really pay much attention to politics. They sense when things are wrong and think, "Obama..Biden. I'm voting for Biden!" That's it. That's how they vote.
Biden is clueless.  Both looters and disruptive protesters need to be held accountable for their actions.  President Trump is  attempting to make them accountable.
Biden may not be the most charismatic person but at least he doesn’t endorse sex trafficking lmao don’t need that in office just sayin
It may be low priority at first, but Biden administration must look at regulating the social media companies. Otherwise this country will continue to be bat shit crazy while risking lives of millions around the world. Sorry Jack.
I guess it is expected by all that Biden choose a woman of color.
Didn't Biden hire 600 lawyers? I think you are all positioning and preparing to launch endless lawsuits and challenges when you loose.

Tell me how that is? Biden has been in politics for 50 yrs trump not even 4. Trump has done more for this country in that short amount of time than Biden ever has. Trump has been cleaning up Biden’s bullshit. Ur logic doesn’t make sense.
Hes right though, they would LOVE to see Biden in the White House. Lil puppet guy
We Do not And Cannot Take 4 more years of trump. We need 4 years of Biden. $ more years of trump will kill us all. #Biden2020Landslide
Yes, but this poll is surveying job approval, which is a little different from presidential polls where people are asked "who would you vote for, Trump or Biden?" So I'm wondering how job approval translates to votes.
Im still waiting for Biden to pick a V.P.
Joe Biden’s potential running mates, in their own words    Great story  -
That's disappointing. You're voting for Trump but with a different letter by his name. Joe Biden's record speaks for itself. So does his inappropriate touching of women and kids.
How does that compare to the economic recovery just before the Obama/Biden administration?
Biden and the left will destroy manufacturing in this country again.
Trump supporters think it's creepy that Joe Biden said his sister was the love of his life (literally in a sweet way watch the video) because they don't know how to be nice to women they aren't attracted to.
My dog is against Biden, since Biden will keep his Mommy at work.  Bolo prefers that Mommy is stuck at home.  Bolo miss Mommy. #dog

How Biden threatens Trump’s fortune
The real question is she the one that ties there puppet Biden’s shoes 👠 for him 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I live in NE Ohio. Trump has begun running ads with a frightened old woman and all it talks about is how unsafe you will be with Biden because he wants to defund the police 🙄
I couldn't help but laugh at how bad the one I saw at work yesterday was. Biden never said he supports defunding the police bc he knew they'd use it as a no sound clip. So instead they claim he supports defunding the police and then edited in a clip of him saying "yes, I do"You just keep thinking that way#biden all the way
Did you see Biden’s plan to give $40 Billion of taxpayer money to farmers? Freakin’ Marxist!
That's a huge stretch there, ain't it Sparkey? Like telling people Joe Biden is a more qualified man to be president?
I would be surprised if Covid-19 ended during Biden's Presidency.
I too miss President Obama, he is great,the words he speaks, the Love he shows and gives And I truly believe Joe Biden will become President and will be like what we both, what we all need, to bad we can't have President Obama
Am I the only person who thinks TRUMPLESTILTSKIN has orchestrated these riots in  order to send in the feds and  save the poorly managed cities by us Democrats? I sure hope once Biden is in office Trump is investigated from the  first day he sat his ass down on the desk chair
Biden was a VP that has gone on to run for President. If it’s okay for him to have done it, why wouldn’t it be okay for her? Biden ran for Pres before being chosen as VP so his ambitions were no secret.
Don’t forget, they’re controlling us with this virus. Think about it. If Biden wins,We may as well live in Siberia
Texas 'is never going to happen,' Biden adviser admits. But 'Georgia is real.'  via  why not both
Biden’s recent gaffes are just weird,”the nurses would whisper in my ear to bring them pillows,” and, “the nurses would breathe air into my nostrils and that would get me going,” so weird that I cannot believe that any people would vote for him!!
Biden has declining dementia. We all know it,the Dems are keeping him out of the public eye. What about the debates. One other thing,he blames President Trump for everything,you can only take that so far, eventually Biden needs to come out of his home and answer direct questions.
And see Biden signs in suburban CLE and industrial towns and cities in Ohio
#CBSThisMorning among other #networks Playing #Trumps ad Where #SeanBigHeadHannity is heard saying #Joe Biden wants to #Defund the police All the networks continue to let Trump tell lies its pitiful You are playing a part in trying to scare #Seniors

But Biden ain’t to old to be the president
There is this one house right off of lake Erie, where the guy has a 4'x8' Biden sign that's like a giant herpes sore!
Is Biden better???
Mr. Biden I am wearing a mask,  social distancing and staying home.  I don't want to die.  My family needs me. Thank you for your advice!! I am taking this very seriously.  I wish you and your family well. Stay safe and may God bless you.
The response isn't equal. If this were a Biden supporter or a BLM protester, it would be all over every major news channel and show. It's barely getting any amplification in comparison.

Welcome to Biden’s America. #TRUMP2020
I get it,loyalty to the party and fighting for the working class but Joe Biden isn’t really for that. He is a corporate politician who isn’t going to fight for anything,everything is going to stay the same. He doesn’t even think we free healthcare in a pandemic🤷🏾‍♂️
Joe Biden set the stage for what we have now and plans to do nothing to change it. The author of the crime bill made way for the police state and Biden said he will do nothing to fix it. He still wants Marijuana to be illegal and isn’t in favor of defunding police🤷🏾‍♂️#WhateverHappenedTo the guilty person that held up sending US troops to rescue our American Ambassador to Libya on September 11, 2012? Was it Obama, Biden, Hillary Clinton or Panetta? Democrats covered it up to reelect Obama. Who was it?
I remember reading Republicans are giving him till labor day to turn things around vs Biden. Their best course of action would be to back impeachment and run Pence on the ticket to try and save the Senate.
Don’t stop speaking out. I spent hours yesterday being shit on by BBs. One of them said they literally wanted RBG to die. Another one said I was MAGA and against BLM because I will support Biden in Nov. They are truly nuts
Biden's higher in the polls, but this seems like a party lines election. Both sides don't want to concede power and both sides don't like who's representing them (in general).
Biden knows it isn’t safe to return our youth to school. Putting our educators and administrators at risk doesn’t help anyone and will only serve to spread this disease further. Remote learning should be the norm at least for the first semester.
Seems like that's the hill the Trump side wants to die on since they're putting all their chips on the wager that Biden will look terrible at the debates versus Trump. What happens if he's fine?
They’ll push ANY other story in their blatant attempt at keeping the corrupt Biden’s out of the news.  Biden is only running for  to keep safe from prosecution.
If you hate biden so much then close your eyes and see RBG’s name. She won’t live another 4 years. The least we can give her is someone who will replace her with a non-frat boy
Do you see what Trump is doing daily? Do you know what he did today? Stfu now with Biden. I will take ANY adult over a child at this point. I’ll take my 20th candidate over him. I’ll do what it takes to save the citizens of this country
Also, you’re just mad Bernie is out. We got what we got. It’s Biden or Trump. That’s the choice. There is no other choice. If someone offered you literal shit to eat or decent but not perfect meal, you gonna really eat shit or starve to death? Stop being a 2 year old
The Biden family should be ashamed of themselves for letting him run
You honestly think Trump doesn't exhibit more signs of early dementia than Biden? All the slurring and jerking when he speaks when his brain misfires? Or the lack of coherent trains of thought? Let alone the fact his father died of Alzheimers, and heredity is the #1 risk factor.
Those troops likely aren't going anywhere. It will take months of planning just to figure out where they're going. By the time they'd be ready to move, President Biden will cancel the order with day one executive orders.
Oh so, you are racist! Nice. Good to know. Biden has moved toward nearly everything Bernie wanted but it still isn’t good enough for you babies.
Not all of them. I don't think Cheney was looking to run after Bush. And Biden likely calls it a career and lets the next generation try to win back the White House if a "normal" Republican had won in 2016.
Lolz. Hahahahaha. You’re hilarious. I am actually voting for the guy who has the most black support of all candidates. He was my 7th pick but I care about who POC want and they want Biden.
Hahahahah. You’re so ridiculous. No, Tara lied to try to harm Biden but Biden’s support was too big for Bernie and his loser bots
This is exactly correct, but the Veep spot has definitely also been a high profile launching pad for a run for the Presidency. This attempt to derail Harris may be from people who have other favored candidates in mind after Biden, and want to stop Harris now.
I agree on  . Since her crap campaign ended, she has been excellent on Covid recovery economics. She'll slice and dice Pence in debate. Rice is foreign policy centric, something Biden will not need partnership on. Harris is the perfect age a d competence.
None of that has to do with how news media companies work. They have templates of things they know are going to happen soon enough already in the can. We all know Biden is going to pick the next Veep in a week or two, and we all know the shortlist.
Those ~3 months between Trump losing and Biden being sworn in are going to be fucking nuts
obama and biden
This is something the theater command will have an order counteracting for President Biden to sign within hours of his inauguration.
Because they would have a write-up like this for all the leading candidates so they can publish it literally the minute Biden actually announces it. Like obituaries for geezer famous people.
Yeah and stupid people in the suburbs will vote Biden because Trump hurts their feelings
If Biden was 1/100th as corrupt as Trump and running against a decent human being, I woukd not vote for him.
I'm curious, who do you think Biden should pick? I wouldn't want to be in Joe Biden's shoes right now.
Facebook is trying to fix this election for Joe Biden cause Joe can’t win on his own!
What did Joe Biden EVER DO FOR BLACK AMERICANS? Answer: NOTHING! Why do you expect him to suddenly change and do something now? What did Trump do? Lowered Black unemployment to LOWEST IN HISTORY, created economic opportunity zones in cities, first crime bill to help blacks, etc
You don’t have any facts with your tweet. You’re as bad as ABC CBS NBC CNN MSNBC NY Times WASHINGTON POST, you just make up FAKE comments!!! Face it - Joe Biden is WRONG FOR AMERICA and YOU KNOW IT!!! AMERICA NEEDS TRUMP!!!
Joe Biden’s ideas are BAD FOR AMERICA! Joe Biden’s ideas would take AMERICA IN THE WRONG DIRECTION! Joe Biden and the Democratic Socialist Party are UNAMERICAN!!!  VOTE FOR TRUMP! Keep America on the path of FREEDOM AND LIBERTY FOR ALL AMERICANS!!!
This is Democrat’s doing so electing Biden will get this ten fold until America is destroyed Karen 😡🤬🖕🏼
Yes, only two of the three. One of the three will most likely be a draw, or a Biden win somehow. Depending on the category of discussion, I don't remember a time when a politician swept a series of presidential debates. Perhaps Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton, but not sure.
WHO SAID? NoCatholic Can Vote For Joe Biden???
Joe Biden Shows Class👇
Interestingly, I think the debates will not swing many votes at all this time around. I see Trump winning two of the three, mostly because Trump thinks faster than Biden.
Why on earth would Biden let someone accused of sexual assault be on his VP selection committee!?
You think Biden will provide any of this?  44 years in politics and hasn’t produced anything close to this.  How could you be fooled he all of a sudden will?
I did a quick search.... so is all to Kamala’s debating prowess, that she didn’t bow down and kiss Biden’s ass when she was RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?!?!!
Seriously??..
And so are the rest of us if Biden wins.
No one is disputing that. Could be Biden too...if Ghislaine survives, we should know “most” of the truth, but some may get to her to barter silence.
I drive a delivery van for Amazon. Seen a few Biden signs in rural Ohio, too. Still mostly all Trump, though, including some setups that took some effort.
The Republicans ruin the economy and the Democrats fix the mess they left. Obama cleaned up Bush’s and now Biden will clean up Trump’s if he wins the upcoming election. If we get four more years of Trump this country will be unrecognizable.
I miss him and his family so much! Such class, instead of the crass we have now. He showed love for his family, never cheated on his wife, was intelligent, and an eloquent speaker. I wish Biden would pick him as his running mate.
I find it amazing that the Dems were pushing the whole “ has cognitive issues” b.s.  Then they nominate a guy (Biden) who has glaringly obvious cognitive issues.  You just can’t make this stuff up!
Xenia is Trump country, there is no room for Sleepy 😴 Joe Biden here!! Xenia and Greene County is ready for more  #BuckeyeBattalion #LeadRight
At this point I suspect that a McGrath win would point to a Biden win by at least 100,000 and she gets enough "meh" votes from people there just to get Trump out. Can't imagine any other way
What did he do now? More “Bernie would have won?” Or “Biden won’t win”?
Shouldn’t you be asking Biden that question?  You forced Trump to publicly say he’d accept the results in 2016, and have stood silent over Clinton and the Dem Party not excepting it ever since.  Repubs always have accepted, the Dems never do unless they win.
Folks.   Its 103 days til the election. This time four years ago, like Biden now, the media told us Hillary was leading by double digits.   Be on guard. The race is just getting started.
Trump can't win again getting 1% less this time because that means Biden will also get at least 1 or 2% more than Clinton did in 2016. The EC math just wouldn't workout in that case.
straight up facts, biden said that and you’re supporting a man who says this? and sniffs kids? and touches kids? need i go more, i can go all day long, i’m bored as hell at work
mind responding to this if you think biden’s the best.Biden could go to the nursing home and Obama could run the country. Problem solved. Next?
Would you vote for a Biden-Obama ticket?
The economy shrank the biggest it’s ever done in history, jobless claims continue to be on the rise, but you continue your false attacks on  and law enforcement. Here’s the truth: Trump tried to repeated cut federal funding for law enforcement. Biden would increase.

I envy Michigan. Ohio is bombarded with  end of the world ads on a daily basis. And too close to KY so we see  even darker view of the future. #voteBlue
You didn’t even read Biden’s plan. If you did, you’d realize what utter nonsense you just said.
It’ll be interesting to see what excuse the Dems concoct to prevent any debates. There’s no way they’d let Biden go head to head with Trump.
Look, I really prefer  pick  but no, I don’t believe  has been given advance notice but instead was canning drafts in anticipation. Biden’s notes today was likely in anticipation of questions about the Dodd/Politico story. Everyone chill out.
There is no question that it helps and has helped thousands of people. Sadly it doesn’t fit the leftist agenda. They need people afraid to keep the schools closed to ensure the big Pharma can make billions on a questionable vaccine and for Biden to get elected.
This, frankly, is something Obama never took seriously enough and it cost the party. Biden gets it.
While I hope you are right, after listening to Barr today say repeatedly that both Obama and Biden illegally spied on Trump, I can’t agree. An indictment only requires a grand jury to believe there is probable cause, unlike the proof required at a trial.
Barr is going to indict both Obama and Biden before the election. Not even hiding it. Barr and Jordan said it multiple times today that Obama and Barr illegally spyed on Trump.  Charges won’t hold but could have a serious impact on the election.
It appears they intend to indict both Obama and Biden, and others, just before the election. Just listen to Barr and Jordan. They are both saying what  they plan on doing.
Wrong again. Zero carbon by 2050 was both Sanders and Biden’s plans:
Every thinking person who doesn’t get their information from hotheads on social media but read the source material can tell the task forces largely wrote the platform, including a carbon neutral goal by 2050, which is literally something Sanders and Biden both ran on.
You realize they weren’t Sanders task forces at all but Biden-Sanders joint task forces. This is getting embarassing for you.
Unlike you, I have:
Don’t even go there. Joe Biden WILL NOT BECAUSE HE CANNOT. He’s a dementia patient
When Biden is president we can sleep at night knowing we are in good hands.
They apparently were able to process the primary back in March where they voted for Biden in a 23 point margin.
Biden won her district by twenty-three points in the March 10th primary.
Bet you lunch Trump won’t show or debate. He will demand conditions that will defeat the purpose of a debate; but in reality he knows he will look like an idiot next to Biden.
They’re holding nothing hostage. Unless they start getting close to all of Sanders delegates plus 47% of the Biden, the platform is going to easily pass despite their threat. This is the dumbest tactic possible.
But Biden IS a full on pedo, so...it makes sense. #ThesePeopleAreSick  #MAGA #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #EvilLeftHandPathDems #RacistDems #FascistDems #DemsHateAmerica #AntifaIsAnAstroturfFoundation #BlackLivesMatterIsAnAstroturfFoundation #GeorgeSorosIsTheAntichrist #RacistBLM
I did the math. They only need to pick up roughly 47% of Biden’s pledged delegates to threaten the platform’s passage.
Also ignores fact that Biden and Sanders ALREADY worked out a compromise on the health care platform with a joint task force.  So they’re basically threatening to reject their own bargain which actually only makes them look bad and disorganized. This is such dumb politics.
I can’t believe they are trying to call this a rebellion like it’s going somewhere. If they couldn’t do this with the platform with nearly 40% of the delegates, why would they think they can with &gt; 25%? Biden and Sanders already worked out a compromise on health care platform.
It should be noted the platform needs a simple majority of all delegates (not just pledged) of which Biden likely has over 72% and Sanders under 25%. So this is empty symbolic posturing.
REALITY CHECK: The platform needs a simple majority to pass and Sanders has less than 25% of all delegates and Biden has over 72%. This is pointless.
This was his post convention bounce. He wasn’t leading for an entire year like Biden has. I get the notion of not getting complacent but let’s be honest too.
To give you a sense how much NBC’s NC poll may either be an outlier or a sign of a worsening environment for GOP, the RCP average has been half the lead it shows Biden. Also Ohio is incredibly competitive.
Biden or not Congratulations on your sobriety
I can’t get specific, but if you want to know what Biden is going to say just ask AOC and comrade Bernie. Can’t wait for the debates.
What has Biden did for this country in 50 years other than making his family and himself  rich
Ready for President Joe Biden
So if the Biden campaign has no enthusiasm, wouldn’t HE have the silent majority?
Change?? Obama was the one that wanted to transform America! Pathetic go ahead hare Trump and vote for Biden not going to work!
Biden’s campaign is ‘suppressing the Hispanic vote’ in Florida, an internal letter claims
Second poll out today showing Biden beginning to get a sizeable lead in AZ and FL. If Trump is truly behind in FL, then that’s pretty much the ballgame.
Trump supporters have never been silent, nor a majority. Joe Biden literally has the support of the majority of Americans.
It takes some amazing misinformation campaign for someone to begin to think Biden, not Trump, is worse than Nixon.
Biden has like 2 functioning brain cells and you want him
Biden is on the record numerous times saying exactly this.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Is it just me but I haven’t heard why Joe Biden is campaigning from his basement ? Maybe we could get him a tree stand
ICYMI: Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
What damage has he done? Do you not read the news? Racist? Your Senator Byrd was an actual member of KKK and Biden and Hillary adored him. No Republicans promote the killing of anyone like the F Party does. But babies in the womb aren’t human right?
Biden will pick some crazy left wing socialist if he picks a black person it will be racist choice why not pick a Spanish or Asian American in my opinion why not pick the best man or woman for the job
Why does Our Revolution or any of the groups think they have any leverage here? Biden has literally nearly three quarters of the entire convention delegates sewn up. Whomever he names is likely to be approved by acclamation.  It’s like they want a pretext to create division.
President of The United States of America Joe Biden
Who says that Biden is gonna be the winner?
Can you contact team Biden and let them know this too
Yep, You win. Pick any prize from the second row- can’t wait for Biden to take the test- I bet you can’t either
I’m a betting man, Biden will not show up or have an excuse. He will not debate Donald Trump. Dummy
yet you do be canceling the homeslice Biden a heck of a lot
Won’t you be surprised when you wake up to see Biden won by a smidge and another hanging chad type BS .   The devious Dems are gonna rig it.   There is no way the REPUBLICRAT SWAMP is going to have another 4 years of Trump.  Btw, why would you trust our govt to keep them secure?
Hey Nester Joe Biden can’t run the country from his basement with people controlling what he says. Dummy
Oh no a landslide would be too obvious.   They’ll make Biden win by just a tiny bit, just a few votes.   This will make it seem legit!   So sad what’s about to happen to this great country after Trump 😢
Of course they are.   This election WILL BE RIGGED.   Does anyone actually believe they are going to accept the election results of “we the people “ considering their behavior for the past 4 years?!   Get real!!  It’ll be Biden by a smidge 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️😤
I’d rather have Biden over trump even tho he’s still senile
Biden has to bring in Obama to speak for him
That is exactly who they are! These are radical communists, anarchists America hating... Biden owns them
Democrats: Packets sent to Trump allies are part of foreign plot to damage Biden
Bro did he say this is Joe Biden’s America and then post Trump’s hectic America? 😂😂
Went to Ft. Hamilton for bloodwork this morning. The girl taking my blood started complaining about how much she has been working the past few months. She then goes on to insinuate that COVID-19 is a media hoax to get Biden elected.  Yeah - bright one there!
Obama the worst President in history shouldn’t be giving advice to anyone and Biden couldn’t put together a 6 piece puzzle for a 2 year old
If Biden is elected he and OAC want to do away with gas cars and planes so you might want to add horses to your list
