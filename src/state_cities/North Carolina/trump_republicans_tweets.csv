Wonder if trump watched it, secretly
He’s so smart. His knowledge of economics + business sense of Donald Trump = we’d be 💯! Hate they’re on different sides. YouTube Clinton on Late Night w/David Letterman. He was amazing each time. This pic was in Gastonia NC at Highland School of Technology stumping for Hillary.
I was watch television and watching this funeral.  I'm sorry I had to turn it I just can't watch President Obama definitely a Trump supporter
And people are still confused why Trump won!
Was talking to a girl, then found out she supported Trump...she had to go🤷🏼‍♂️
Looking forward to seeing you voted out.  You helped enable trump and all of his divisions in this country.
Really? What happened to no concerns we got this under full control.... Trump’s stated concern for poll safety defies his otherwise aggressive push to “reopen” the nation from partial shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus, even as rising confirmed coronavirus cases,
Trump: School's MUST open, it's safe enough.  Also Trump: Aww, geez, I don't know if it's safe for us to have the election.
🚨🚨🚨NEWS FLASH TO NUTTY NANCY🚨🚨🚨        We Republican Trump Supporters are the  Working Americans that make up the Middle Class.
HQL is too cheap and simple. Besides, since President Trump touted it as a possible treatment in the beginning they can’t admit to it no matter how many people it could save.
Made a song to vent my feelings on the school reopening and Trump’s indifference to our concerns.   Not a happy song.    #schoolsreopening #education #teacher #rappingmyanger
If they think I'm going to listen to this Witch Doctor over Covid-19      THEY CRAZY AS HELL!!! Is this the best you can come up Trump? SERIOUSLY?  Come on November💯❤
#areyoubetteroff Trump has approved discord
Trump has encouraged divisiveness
They going to get them all. Trump, William Bar, Stone(maybe) and several others will be in handcuffs in January. It's almost a sure thing Trump will finally get his walls. I can't wait 😂
Judge Napolitano is no more than a self-enriching anti Trump Liberal Fox employee who thrives on his own self-importance.
I see. I think November will be a lose/lose for our country. Sleepy Joe is a joke. Trump thrives off this power which isn’t what you want. Narcissistic af. Starts shit. Atleast he’s mentally aware tho. Biden 4 prez is elder abuse at this point
The virus is messing the economy up, who said Trump was racist, for closing the borders? Now they blame Trump for not shutting down the borders. Yeah whatever, everyone knows the truth. What is hidden ,will not remain hidden, what is covered will not remain covered.
Bill Clinton messed up the economy. The jobs started leaving after he signed the free trade agreement. Just like Ross Perot said they would. You will that giant sucking sound, of our jobs leaving,to other countries.Everything was getting better when Trump changed the NAFTA deal.
Jerry Nadler will make me vote for President Trump again. 😎🤓😎🤓😎🤓😂😂👌
If anyone tries to say Trump isn’t racist after this, they are either blind or in doubt. Cause this ain’t it
Jerry Nader will make me vote for President Trump.
I didn’t think it was a report but an indictment(s). A report will just be swept 🧹 under the rug. President Trump has taught us how to win, so now let’s go win!
hmmm, let's look at two must win states for Trump.   Oh, I see now.
Yes, at the Confederate monument protest, America, rebel, and Trump. The flag wavers spewing hate and nonsense.
I felt like there would be a lot more of this kind of thing in the trump presidency, he would probably be more successful if more of his messaging consisted of stuff like this. Culture war stuff plays only to his base, this appeals to people on both sides.
Why Trump’s of course! 😂
If this is how u plan to vote ... U know exactly where u can stick it!🙄👊🏻👍 TRUMP 2020🇺🇸
And then hop on that plane and give Trump a big ol hug!
Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever seen Donald Trump wearing a mask ? Asking for a friend 🤷 #COVID19 #coronavirus #Corona #COVID19 #DonaldTrump
What if  loses but refuses to leave office? Here's the worst-case scenario | Lawrence Douglas
Kanye is the black version of Trump. Ain’t no other way to put it..
Yah dumbasses bet not vote for Kanye or Trump in November.. ❗️❗️❗️
Please do. Trump is the only one this time out. The democrats have gone of the edge
Question, if they develop a vaccine for the China virus will it work on the much deadlier Trump Virus?
Trump didn’t give up his lavish life to be tormented for nothing. You need to listen to him more.
Well your degree from Trump U hasn’t seem to do much for your life either. At least I’ve never been taken in by a lying POS, who would probably call you and others like white trash behind your back!
I’m voting for President Trump no matter what!
Someone sold it to them as the magic bullet cure, they all went in financially for it, and now they desperately need Trump to be free of the distaste of it to hang on to power.
Nah, not a Judge Jeanine fan, and I often wonder why Trump snorts constantly, “coughs, coughs” Adderall or something else?
Did they teach you that word at Trump University? I thought they only taught perfect and beautiful, or person,woman,man, camera, TV.
Yep I even graduated with Michael Jordan! Did you get your degree from Trump University or are you a GED gal?
Graduate of the UNC Chapel Hill , top 20% of my class. Did you go to Trump University?
Just like the impeachment hearings of Donal Trump. They can only hear themselves
As unhealthy as he looks, he could have Narcolepsy. But if he keeps on wearing that mask 😷 I would project nothing but serious health issues. Yeah, I’m making medical opinions on something I saw on tv, you know like when they diagnosed Trump with mental issues? Sue me.
He stands there and looks down at a piece of paper and calls a name. Do you think 🤔 he knows what question is about to be asked? Even still, he rambles. And he said he was worried about getting a vaccine distributed once they have one. I know how because I listened to Trump.
I dont see Trump winning California or Washington
North Carolina is not one of your whores.  You can't just leave, talk shit and come back to stroke yourself in our faces.        In a reversal, Trump says he'll accept GOP nomination in North Carolina
Sorry Melissa, but it wasn’t on the “Approved” That event will not get Trump defeated in November.
All news is filtered through the goal of defeating President Trump in November. The o former Soviet Union had a more free press than we have today. At least we still have a choice not to believe these clowns 🤡, but that could change after November.
I’ve been around since Eisenhower, and Trump is the best President ever. I almost hate to say it since I loved Reagan so much. But I’ll bet RR is looking down, and smiling. 😀.
Someone explain to me the camera. Man. Woman. Thing related to Trump
That’s exactly the way I felt when I voted for McCain and Romney. Thank God for President Trump.
Make sure report everything including the fact that the Secret Service planned to have the wall higher and stronger in summer of 2016 before Trump was even elected. The additional fencing was added, but have they completed work there?
and  you know what is fucking hilarious?You guys are LITERALLY using images of what it's like in Donald Trump's America RIGHT NOW to say this is what it would be like in Biden's America.This is both IGNORANT and PATHETIC at the same time!
What until you come out of hiding? Or until Trump is still your president
Trump has helped the US to see its dark side. It will still be there when he goes | Nesrine Malik  You lefties are going to be sorely disappointed!  Watching your reaction to Trump's victory this year will be better than 2016.
I tried but it became such an arduous task. A very close friend who just became politically aware texted me if I was watched trump coronavirus update in mid April. To model I turned him on. It lead to a thirty minute texting rampage by me after his idiocy triggered me.
'What does Ghislaine Maxwell have on Trump,' asks new attack ad by Lincoln Project  Calling these disloyal "Republicans" conservative is like calling a chicken intelligent.
Facebook has far too much power — and uses it to let Donald Trump run lying ads so they can profit. It's time for federal regulators to investigate #Facebook and act.
If Democratic governors knew what they were doing Trump wouldn’t have to step in and protect its people (because that’s governments sole job) and the UN is just mad because we don’t listen to their BS because they would love for agenda 21 to happen
Don't care what you have to say.. if you can wear Trump....I can wear Biden
Oh, so they recommend the BLEACH and LYSOL too? I think not Sir!!! That's your loving Trump so don't blame others for Trump's actions...You are ridiculous!!!
Trump
Wouldn’t surprise me one bit. #Gastonia is trump country. Racial problems are real and it’s not some new thing over ice cream. #soMuchMoreThanIceCream
Not going to happen because we in Trump’s Red Army will not allow it😡
He can’t stand the fact that Trump found another corruption that 40 years of previous administration’s failed at.
Lord just wait til they hit Chicago. I see mass amounts of deaths coming. Most of them have illegal weapons and definitely not afraid to shoot back. Start praying for Chicago as well as Portland. This is Trump's world not ours!!!
Twitter does this a lot to #Conservatives &amp; Trump supporters especially.
We pray for President Trump's endurance in this race set before him. Only God can allow a person to overcome and conquer all the evil that surrounds him and beckons him to cave.  We hope our voices that support him ring louder in his ear than those who don't. MC
That should go a long way towards de-escalation.  Be great for Trump’s deceptive photo array; hard to believe this administration is so evil; staging for the sole purpose of misinforming &amp; terrifying the public.  Thank God for journalists &amp; free speech.
Trump has great vision for our country. Wants us to remain a capitalist country where individuals have the right and the opportunity to do great things. Biden and his crew want to equalize everyone through marxis/socialist governing that history has shown to fail!!
I have a Trump joke, but it’s a colossal disaster every which way you look at it.
No #Conservative values. Still a anti Trump Bush supporter.
Dems wanted to lower drug prices since last year. The Bill has been on McConnell's desk. FINALLY, McConnell is doing his job. There are many more Bills still waiting to get passed. I see Trump taking the credit, but why could they not pass this last year?
Yea. Big Cat was worried that Dave would make trump look good. That is woke.
VOTE, people have died to.                  4 more months until chaos ends!  Just think, no more Trump daily news &amp; trying to control narrative, blaming others &amp; taking no ownership of anything except his secret police.
Yeah, but you would call them an Uncle Tom for going to Trump’s White House.
Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania  #FoxNews Registered voter polls are worthless.
Leo I swell with American pride listening to your podcast.   You should run for office... or maybe President Trump can appoint you to a position where you can help these cities in crisis!
Obama can literally sneeze and trump will say he started Ebola and COVID
Quick, let me look up what he was doing in 2015..... ummm, yeah, not just the Trump thing, but I’m sure that didn’t help.
Trump talks about acing cognitive skills test for remainder of Presidency, Obama never mentions Nobel.
Because he’s a Democrat and it’s OK to protest and not socially distance then get the economy back up and running due to the hatred towards President Donald Trump
Easy answer... Dear Leader knows all... Dear Leader needs face time since rallies have fallen flat... Dear Leader loves the sound of his own voice.   Collins asks Trump: Why aren't medical experts at briefing? - CNN  via
Trump, Tracy Philbeck, Tony’s ice cream, and Tennessee all start with the letter T. The 20th letter of the alphabet. 4 T’s, 4:20. Blaze it 😤
Tony’s has been the hotbed of far-right conservatism in Gaston Co. for a long time. Within the last few years, Tony’s held a Trump rally and broadcasts Fox/ Spectrum news daily.
Not a problem, personally, but there’s no reason for anyone on the left to fear voicing anti-conservative, anti-Trump sentiments. The right has no cancel culture to speak of, not much media presence, and tend not to group think. I hope the fearful vote
Wait until that weird yeeyee fucker who drives the beat up Chevy Van with the weird saying shit and having all those Trump Flags show up here in Downtown Gastonia... 🥴
I believe this IS Trump’s America, it’s how he made it great again.
Oh yeah, they really looked terrifying.  Trump calls all protesters rioters.

Well, with the way things are slanted for law enforcement right now, the media is going to eat it up and blame trump and start civil war 2.0
You are reducing yourself 2 his level by calling it the #TrumpVirus! It’s the #coronavirus. Both of you make me sick! Didn’t vote for Trump &amp; want him gone but you are not helping when you get n2 these name calling battles! Show LEADERSHIP!
Upside of mail-in voting: -Paper trail -Safe in time of COVID -Earlier results on election night -Denial of voting interference -Trump doesn't want it
I've been saying Trump is putting us back on the Gold standard and the appointment of Judy Shelton (a known Gold bug) is reaffirming this belief. Adios federal reserve!
True. Neither party is overly fond of Trump. That's why he is my President. I wish he would not get pulled into some of the squabbles that he does, but hay makes him, Trump I guess.
Apparently you haven’t kept up. Though Obama was no longer President he was in on the whole plot to accuse Trump with collusion and remember the riots after Trumps election. I was ashamed I voted for Obama in 08 didn’t fool me the 2nd time
Read through these figures and then think about Trump’s push to ban undocumented immigrants from being counted in the Census.President Donald Trump suggested delaying the 2020 presidential election on Thursday, tweeting it will be “the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.”

Trump’s inciting the far-right to fight a violent civil war. Here’s how we stop it by Darshan ( Sanghrajka  //  you should have the author of this on one of your shows.
President Trump’s suggestion of postponing the November election drew condemnation from Republican officials in the states and on Capitol Hill as they tried to bat away questions their own party leader had raised about the legitimacy of that upcoming vote.
So Trump made Cain attend? Pretty racist to assume Herman couldn't think for himself.
Herman Cain died after contracting COVID possibly at Trump Rally 😶😯
If the election was delayed, what would be the implications for Trump's term. It's supposed to only be four years. Would it get automatically extended? Would Pence take over?   Interesting constitutional conundrum.
Do you think Trump is planning to attend Herman Cain's memorial? I mean, since attending Trump's rally is what killed him? Or do you think he'll take no responsibility at all?
Do you think Trump is planning to attend Herman Cain's memorial? I mean, since attending Trump's rally is what killed him? Or do you think he'll take no responsibility at all?
Sooooo Worst GDP in recorded history, calls to delay the election, Covid death of former leading presidential candidate who went to Trump rally unmasked  Hell of a day in Trumpland. Hell of a day.
Let’s focus on voting out every single republican who enabled trump, and then shun them for the rest of their lives.
The GOP is stuck in the Donald Trump tar pit. Maybe, in a few million years, they might get to become crude oil.
Herman Cain denounced mask-wearing requirements at a Trump rally. Contacted Covid at that same rally. Spent 6 weeks in the hospital (absolute hell for sure)  and has just died today.  HC was smarter than most yet ignored the experts.
I'm a Trump supporter and stuff like this makes it difficult to actually justify my vote. You don't realize but this stuff loses support.
All time Trump tweet
This (&amp;150,000 dead) is why trump is trying to distract us with this delay the election nonsense.
Trump’s feed is already bonkers!
This is big!  Can Trump win without Michigan?
During a visit to West Texas, President Donald Trump hinted that the second round of stimulus checks could exceed the $1,200 payment amount issued in the first COVID-19 stimulus package.
Opinion: A colossal failure of Trump's leadership
Good luck with that. I feel sorry for the decent citizens of your city.  Don’t cry to President Trump or VP Pence when you need millions of $’s to clean up your mess.  You need to be voted out. You are a disgrace to your position.
The Trump administration is considering a plan that would allow states to require mandatory drug testing for some food stamp recipients.
The Trump could literally destroy a city and kill millions in a matter of seconds. So could a half dozen other world leaders. That seems pretty powerful.
I think it’s really sad how he is being used by the Democratic Party.  But if it helps Trump win then so be it.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with Trump's lapdog , dam 2020 is crazy
LOL! I was actually about 3 or 4 when Ford was in office, but, yes, I'm sure Trump's shortcomings are obvious around the world. I honestly would have to research your leaders there, but the "old folks" usually have a strong handle on things.
I'm a Trump supporter and I don't live in fear.
"The NWO is conspiring against Donald Trump to suppress the population". I'm 99% sure hes said that exact thing.
But then, Trump is no Republican. Trump is a Trumpican, only interested in himself.

Trump really got on here and said people in low income housing are criminals. That’s some evil white supremacist shit. I don’t even have words. If you support that man you have no morals whatsoever
No one could do worse than Trump if they actively tried. Someone that did NOTHING would have done a better job than the guy that downplayed the virus, refused to wear a mask, and claims Nazis are "very fine people". I also doubt Biden would be taking advice from Dr. Demon Sperm.
This was what Trump discussed with Putin instead of bounties.
Bill Barr is the worst human alive but Trump is much worse because it's his administration.
Now we know what Trump and Putin talked about.
Now we know what Trump and Putin talked about...

Then stay away from Trump, McConnell,  or anyone related to those demons.
i hate when people see your visibly upset about something and instead try to get upset themselves to trump your upset. that’s why I don’t have a lot of close girlfriends as is, i can’t deal.
trump and his administration of criminal liars lie and contradict themselves on a daily basis. Even about the most mundane things, such as a baseball pitch. I read trumps tweets. I know that 1+1=2. I don’t need any news outlet to know that where there is smoke, there is fire.
Then we also need sensible background checks to be allowed to protest so nuts and "wacos" don't burn down buildings, riot and kill innocent people. It's common sense.
Twitter temporarily limited Donald Trump Jr.’s account after he posted a video featuring a doctor making false claims about coronavirus cures and mask usage, a Twitter spokesperson said Tuesday.
As long as the reported numbers are fake, then I will believe Trump must be doing something right. Why fake the numbers otherwise?
Please tell me that the story about Trump’s new favorite doctor claiming that COVID is transmitted via sex with demons is not real.
President Donald Trump will hold a White House briefing Tuesday to discuss efforts to fight COVID-19 in the U.S. Click here to watch.
We won’t win. As Trump said in 2016, the system is rigged.
What a joke and a sham, it should be called "AG Barr listens in house CMTE hearing".  It's a show of Democrats grandstanding, anti-Trump bashing, accusations, lies, and should be an embarrassment to Congress.  It's all politics and Democrats should be voted out of Congress.
That’s right. Muh Trump.

But these lockdowns are only stupid and inept because people don’t comply and the government’s response time sucked thanks to the Trump administration. Look at NZ, sure maybe unobtainable for us as a larger country but still their quick response now means they can be open now
Yes, but they aren't being elevated by the magic cure crowd. Regardless, it doesn't change how magic cure advocates are only doing it out of loyalty to Trump.
That depends on whether the voter in question would consider voting for Biden or Trump or not voting at all rather than voting for a third party candidate. Many 3rd party voters would choose to not vote if their only options were GOP/DEM. No need to pick the lesser of two evils.
Trump Says He Will Accept RNC Nomination In NC After All
Between trying to privatize everything, hamper election results, and Trump's personal issue with Bezos/Amazon- he is determined to gut a crucial component that has been part of our democracy from its infancy. Horrific.

President Donald Trump promised the United States would defeat COVID-19 in record time Monday.
No...nothing makes sexually assaulting a person ok.  My remark is aimed at the hypocritical fakenews and Democrats who continue to bash Trump and silent on Joe Biden.
Just two days after President Trump visited the Triangle, Vice President Mike Pence appears to be headed to the area.
So, what do you do when a relatove tells you that Trump is a strong leader who loves America? (He did concede he is a National embarassment with mostly bad policies, and is delusional) Who is a better leader than any liberal?
Even hypothetically, trump is much too far removed from deserving any of that. It’s not like he made a few mistakes...all of his misdeeds are CALCULATED and intentional. I have to disagree “it could have always been POTUS”. Unless you are referring to a different POTUS.
Outside chance at best but IF Trump loses by enough to make voters want a new direction AND the field is sufficiently divided AND he has a clear lane AND polarization doesn't drastically increase then he might pull it off.
COVID has really spotlighted hypocrisy with democrats &amp; republican “principles.” Dems: close up boarders; complains about govt response not enough while cheers for govt healthcare; Repubs: no real response to govt shutting down livelihoods &amp; cheers for trump bucks (socialism)
Step 1 happened
Sir I have had your back since 2015. I paid out for a MAGA hat, for the shipping. Not only did I not receive my hat, I keep getting different texts and phone calls wanting me to buy Trump coins I believe in even a trump sticker or something I'm really thinking about not voting 4U
Trump caring for Congressional approval? Don’t make me laugh. He moved funds appropriated for military bases’ improvement and he used them for the Wall. He’s a con man. He doesn’t care about checks &amp; balances. He cares about DJT only.
I agree with President Trump.  Everyone looks for lies to tell or make the worst out of everything he does or says.  I just shut them out because it’s senseless
Biden is winning in a la landslide....Biden is 23 points ahead and now coasting to victory for the WH.  Trump will do like Obama did....walk out smiling.

The same people who said trump would ruin America are currently burning it to the ground.
I don’t think it was propaganda in the early stages, nobody knew what we were dealing with at all. I changed my opinion of the left handling it when trump closed the border to China and they all called him racist for it. That’s clearly a step forward in handling a pandemic.
President Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien has tested positive for the coronavirus — making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far.

Trump's solution to stop people coming here from "sh*thole countries" has apparently been to try and make America a bigger sh*thole then the one they are coming here from. So stable. Much genius.
The protests will face by then.  Then the American people will be reminded of how miserably Trump failed during this pandemic.  We've become the laughing stock of the world under his administration.   That will end in November.
Trump has learnt a lot from his dictator friends: Putin, Erdogan, Li, Kim Jong Un
"God help us....Trump is not the problem."
Trump?  Every American is banking on it, oops... well not everyone.   Democrats and fakenews still pulling for coronavirus to last till November, even if kills every American.
Said it before and will say it again. Better than Trump is a very, very low bar. Liberalism can only win by pole vaulting, by aspiring to the highest heights possible.
Ali the process needs to be explained because once the election is validated the Chief Justice Roberts will swear in the POTUS.  Trump doesn’t have a choice.  Normalizing it is when we pretend as citizen that Trump is all powerful.

I think there’s one really funny and ironic thing about trump calling protestors “terrorists”, it shows that after almost 20 years the average American is still far too stupid to realize that you can’t win a war on terror. You can’t defeat an ideology with guns and chemical
You can’t trash talk my drunk food with better food then tell me I’m SoL that’s not how it works. I’m telling papa trump.
The Democratic Party does want to strip us of free speech, the 2nd amendment, religious freedoms. Of these I have no doubt but I am talking about how has Trump been trying to take them away. He is fighting to save our constitutional rights.
I'm pretty sure  took most of my Trump check.
Nope not a thing except being puppets like Trump is.
If that happens, (I am hopeful it does) then Trump and fam can have their own prison that they can live in.

President Trump has the authority to bring in federal agents when federal property is being vandalized. What is wrong with you people who think that what is going on during these so called peaceful protests are okay?
Still, Trump controls the numes as Commander in Chief
AMERICANS 4 TRUMP 2020!  Stand up 4 Trump!
Per  President Trump’s federal agents are kidnapping people 😂😂😂 in a way I wish POTUS would let these protester cities just have their way and do what they want but don’t give them a single penny for rebuilding/cleaning up the destruction.
I thought  was bad but I think that  is trying to compete with who can be worse? The bald headed guy is a joke.  Trying to make the protesting in Portland seem so peaceful? And Trump is a monster for stopping this nonsense? Sickening!
I don’t trust this guy at all.  I think President Trump should have never listened to Fauci and he probably regrets it.  But when so called health professionals advise you on what to do with time of the upmost essence you are going to listen to them.
Thank you for all that you do President Trump. NC loves you!
Trump is a joke that failed miserably at job he proved unfit for.
This is what the lack of leadership from the Trump administration &amp; governors like Abbott &amp; DeVirus has gotten to.

The arrogance that these thugs have to think they have the right to wreak such havoc on cities and no one is supposed to say or do anything against it is ridiculous. They need to be stopped. Enough is enough. Thank you President Trump!
A judge ordered the release from prison of President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying he believes the government retaliated against him for planning to release a book about Trump before November’s election.
Once a con man always con man Trump is.
"If this was true..."  Maybe the Trump base is that dumb, but it doesn't extend beyond 37%.
I can post fact all day about #LyinBiden. All you got is a stupid meme
I would welcome the federal agents if my city were being destroyed and I no longer felt safe living there. What’s wrong with these people trying to make Trump look like the bad guy when it’s these so called “protesters” that are creating anarchy?
Same reason they show up to the rallies huh. Trump 2020!
More like insane tRump's choas is just like he is.
Obama was so afraid of Trump he didn't run for a third term.
Did Trump go on a tear in February about everyone masking up immediately before the virus arrived in the U.S. instead of mumbling about how it’ll go away on its own?...
I hope I’m wrong. Though I won’t be surprised if militias start violence near single polling places in large cities and Trump shuts down the election. He will not leave the WH peacefully I’m afraid.
Trump always talks about getting that “small loan of a million dollars from his pops” you have to be worth several millions and in ELITE class to even have that opportunity. Even if he wasted the $$$ he’d still have been rich
Laboratories across the U.S. are buckling under a surge of coronavirus tests, creating long processing delays that experts say are undercutting the pandemic response.
Like clockwork, everyone who says something mean about Trump becomes a "failed RINO"
Trump is normalizing the look of white militias so he can mobilize them in November and scare people away from polling places.
Max follows a chiropractor on YouTube but he came out with a video immediately calling everyone “snowflakes” and said he supports Donald Trump and that his page is only for conservatives who pay for their services and lmao boy he unsubscribed so quick because who the fuck asked
is sending federal agents to other U.S. cities like he did in #Portland. Speaking at the White House Wednesday, Trump said there's been a "rampage of violence," and he's deploying federal agents in #Chicago, #Albuquerque and other cities.
Don’t you just love how peaceful they are? Lol so innocent, not violent at all. Shame on President Trump sending in “secret” police to put a stop to this.  How dare they arrest them. Did you hear they have been “THROWING” them into cars too!
I think it is really sad that the Democratic Party is using this man just to declare him incompetent if he were to win and then the VP will be president. I think this is their plan to get who they really want. I pray it never happens because I support Trump.
Jimmy I love watching you but stay away from politics. Your show has always been one of my favorites because the other ones were so focused on Trump bashing. You have a fan base of Trump supporters. You make me laugh and create a diversion from daily stress. ❤️
Wow now democratic government is trying to dictate what you can eat? California wake up and vote these lunatics out of office. It’s the only way to save your beloved state and vote to keep Trump in office! Vote red!
I think they are suppressing the use of it so that more people will die which works really well for the democratic agenda against President Trump. Evidence has shown that if used at the beginning stages of virus it works really well.
Etsy is full of good options.
This is awkward  To show how violent left-wing protesters have gotten with police the Trump campaign used an image of … Ukrainians stomping on a Ukrainian cop. Pro-democracy Ukrainians, I should say, who were resisting the goon-squad security forces of Putin puppet Yanukovych.
Except it's happening in "tRump's" America? Hello?
The fact that  and  would try to make this about Trump sending officers in to arrest these animals being such a terrible thing is mind blowing. And the words “secret police” “throwing them in cars”. So dramatic!
Please remind your viewers that Republicans are allowing Trump to break the norms and be more authoritarian ergo violating the constitution.
is a liar and bigot who is a Trump suck-up who is lower than a snakes belly.  What would Lindsey say if Federal Agents were harassing KKK in South Carolina?
is a Republican who Makes excuses for GOP.  Watch his interviews of GOP vs DEM Party official.  He stated today that he would hope Trump would get more on message in his campaign.  This pseudo journalist is hoping Trump get his act together to get re-elected.
"Cruz isn’t alone in preferring to operate in the minority. Look no further than Trump himself... the president will occasionally lapse into rhetoric about, say, the unrest in cities like Portland that might lead one to believe Joe Biden was president instead of Trump himself...
Cuz waiting 4 years is instant gratification, lol. Pay no attention to the fact that Trump says he's going to do a lot of things he never does.  Btw, still waiting for antifa and drug cartels to be designated as terrorists.....
WATCH LIVE: Trump resumed the coronavirus briefings Tuesday after discontinuing them in April, when he declared them a waste of time.
I think Biden could end up blowing out Trump so badly he takes Texas but let's hold off the hype train until we have a little more than some mid summer polls.

Now you Han Man are sick.  It's a waste of time to talk to you and the trump man..
Never be as great as Trump
I don’t deny that..But David Duke and the KKK support the Republican nominee, The alt-right, you know the group who was saying “Jews will not replace us”? &amp; most other white Supremacists support Donald Trump. The party of the confederate flag &amp; states rights when it suits them.
It's Trump that's murdering people.
Yes I'm voting for Trump Concord North Carolina
Excuse me but YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TRUMP CAN DO! You’d be amazed at what’s C o m I n g!!!!
I agree. But this all sure seems like Trump is expecting to lose regardless. He knows ALL those polls can’t be fake...
Well, either plausible deniability or just not trusting him to keep his mouth shut. If it was your job to guard a huge secret like that, would you hand that info over to a loose cannon like Trump?
So y’all not going to report on the GDP numbers or Trump’s tweet?
Exactly. If Trump isn't reelected then his presidency ends at noon on January 20th.
It can't be delayed. It's in the Constitution. If there's no election then Trump's presidency ends at noon on January 20th and the Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi,  becomes President.
That would put Mike Pence in the White House. Trump is out at noon on January 20th if there isn't an election. The Speaker of the house then takes over, currently Nancy Pelosi.

Trump attended a fundraiser in Texas without a mask on the day the US hit 150,000 coronavirus deaths  Yes, yes. He went here; went there; did this; did that; &amp; it's always pointed out 'No Mask'. NEVER pointed out that the man who took HCQ not getting sick.
So, Ted, you're just now waking up to how badly Trump is destroying the Republican party?

It's payment for what he owes Putin/Russia. Traitor! 🤬 There's an escape hatch for Trump someplace, an idling plane, a dug out tunnel, a fake Russian passport. I hope he rots for what he has done to our country.
Lol you can’t be serious. This dude thought he was married to Ivanka Trump
Mr.Booker you are right. Everyone, please read “The Color of Law” by Richard Rothstein. It’ll help you understand Trump’s racist tweet.
NC, TRUMP COUNTRY!
Exactly, they want these people to fall. Trump is creating false issues and not dealing with the main problem. He is trying to do away with anyone who is a problem.  Children in cages, dying all over, no money. He wants to kill us
It’ll never fly with Trump
So Trump belongs in prison? I agree.
Look, I totally understand. I shouldn’t speak for Black folks, but I do know how brothas in the hood think and I listen to my elders.Overall,we’re still very hopeful in America and wanted Bernie to win so bad but we let “electability” persuade us so we can rid ourselves of Trump.
First, let’s get rid of Trump. In 2024, we’re getting a progressive black woman who is not playing around. Just watch and see.
Please, where is the GOP health plan promised by trump 7/14 in 2weeks? Please go after this!
Where is the health plan ! Trump promised 7/14 he would sign the GOP health plan in 2 weeks. Even you should be able to figure out that date was 14+14= 7/28. Where is the plan !!!!
I am going to do my part to make sure Trump loses NC!
Hmmm if Donald Trump said "I don't F with Black Americans" you would call for impeachment. Lebron James says "I don't F with white people" jutting happens. What's wrong with this situation? #NBA  #racist #StopTheSpread
That's insane. Biden will top 400 electoral votes &amp; the Democrats will take the Senate. Trump has destroyed the Republican party.
TRUMP ALL THE WAY!

Matt,  God and Trump HAVE THIS!
President trump has; -Banned Bump stocks. -Increased minimum age for firearm purchases. -Implemented red flag laws -No knock raids. -Supported the ban on body armor.  Please tell me how Trump is going to protect your 2nd amendment. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #VoteGold
I didn't think I could HATE Trump and this administration any more, yet here we are! 🤬🤬
You are the liar! These are not peaceful protests! Trump is doing the job in your state that you should be doing!!  More deceit from your paper!! America is watching and we are onto you!!
You have your nerve asking Trump for anything after you allowed Deblasio to defund police which destroyed your businesses!! You are both a disgrace!! You both should be in jail for not jailing your rioters! You reap what you sow!
I might vote for Trump but I've accepted hes of pretty average intelligence on a lot of stuff
Trump did not know the location of counties with US troops.  So he asked Putin, who told him “Germany”.  Trump said “finally a place I’ve heard of, how many should I withdraw?”  Putin said, “Go big or go home.” Trump said, “That’s what I thought.”
Thank you Dictator Trump, for personally handing out the largess.  Who needs a democracy when we have your beneficence.
In Donald Trump’s America, low income housing equates to crime. That’s a lie. These are no longer dog whistles by the Birther in Chief, they are bull horns of racism. Don’t get numb to this shit.
More than 60 thousand innocent people died in 4 cities run by Democrats who denied doctors the right to prescribe HCQ.  They needed thousands to die so they could blame Trump. Justice is coming.
To win a majority – and control mapmaking -- Democrats must win seats in suburban and rural areas that President Trump won handily four years ago.  Like in Cabarrus County, where Democrat Gail Young is trying to defeat Republican House incumbent Larry Pittman.
I respectfully disagree, and here's why.... a person should only endorse products he is very familiar with and can speak about in an intelligent, coherent manner. Trump doesn't (can't?) read books, but beans....? As the kids say, that's his jam.
I call it the Trump virus.
Trump doesn't double down, he throws a temper tantrum.
Trump is messing with the post office to make it non-functional by the election.
saw this coming like a freight train: their attempts to remove a Potus duly elected have failed: came the virus (suspiciously spread) and why not blame Trump for it?  Elite Dems, with the help of MSM Media  have encouraged violence and destruction.  Who' s paying the terrorists?

You Trump supporters need to come up with some new insults. Bless your hearts! 🙄
Speaking of White House renovations, I'm more concerned about the 13 foot fence being erected. What is Trump planning that would cause them to be needed?
Remember that Trump is sabotaging the post office in preparation for the election.
You have to remember that Trump believes that lies make things become true. The US has a massive inventory of HCQ, so wouldn't it be nice if it worked? So he just says it does.
Trump is bringing this out in people.

That they aren't Trump
The democrats weren’t looking in 2016. They were doing the opposite. They were hiding their own plan to steal that election too. That’s why election night Trump only had 1% chance. They were confident they succeeded in stealing the election.
Trump is all the truth I need in my brain
Soon as I get that next Trump bribery check, Me and the soulmate are getting our asses as far from NC as possible. With the RNC being In Charlotte, half of our state will likely burn.
That was the mistake the entire news establishment made during the 2016 campaign, continued to make during his attempt to govern, and appears to be doing again.  The truth is harsh.  I wish it were not so, but we all need to face the damn truth. Trump is incompetent in every area
Great advice.  But how about you take it, instead of pandering to the ignorant Trump Administration.
Portland protest are now about The First Amendment.  A a wannabe dictator is unleashing Federal Police for political purposes.  It only makes the rest us more adamant Trump must be removed.  He makes everything he touches worse. He is incompetent.
Call me naive, but I didn't realize how much racism still exists until Trump revealed it.
He also just defended slavery and implied DC should not be able to gain statehood because they dont have enough white people. Watch out for this guy. He could easily inherit the Trump movement in 2024 because he is just as radical but knows how to be kinda subtle about his ideas.
His is the Republican Senator from Arkansas who gained attention last month after writing an opinion editorial in The New York Times encouraging Trump to send in the military to confront protesters, an idea that made even Sean Hannity kinda uncomfortable.
No one had to die. HCQ should have been given. All because they didn’t want to give Trump credit.
Make sure you watch the Trump ads so that he has to pay for rhem.
THE REAL QUESTION MR. MCCONNELL WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GIVE IN TO THE DEMOCRATS? ARE YOU A DEEP STATE RHINO? THAT JUST WANTS TO APECE AND KEEP WASTING OUR MONEY? YOU HAVE YET DONE ANYTHING THAT FAVORS PRESIDENT TRUMP!
Trump is all about reactions, not results. This is a small example.
600k die from heart disease annually. 140k from Covid, absolutely no reason to shut down and keep school closed.    Cuomocide and political scam. Your hatred from Trump discredit anything you say,it's all about hate not fact.
Refunded for what? Their Trump University tuition?
Hcq doesn’t work though. I admire her passion but people are doing a whole lot to make trump appear right.

He’s ahead in polls and increasing his lead.  Why exactly should he do interview on Fox?  Let Trump talk.  Best strategy ever.
Trump made it perfectly clear that he actively suppressed testing in order to make the numbers lower and the death toll higher.

I have to be honest. Since Trump has been in office, especially the last 6 months, I have drank too much, cursed too much, felt rage way too much, can't sleep. My anxiety is through the roof and I feel hopeless sometimes. Anyone else?
Trump - the antidote to sound judgement and reason.

I was in the military when the ACA was passed, so I didn't pay premiums. My disabled mother was finally able to get insurance. As veterans, my wife and I were thrilled that Obama signed the Veterans Choice Act in 2014. The one Trump falsely tries to take credit for now.
They are using this an political weapon designed to blame Trump for the chaos, the discord, the crimes.  Law and order need to be restored and people need to ask themselves if they want the country to go down in flame.  If it is, then they need to vote for Biden
While I realize Trump has made Twitter the de facto medium for his own public statements, please remember that that isn't normal. Biden has in fact made a statement on Portland.
Why name just one when comprehensive lists are kept of Trump's lies?
He might wish to, but it won't work. They had an election during the Civil War. Besides, if there isn't an election Trump is still out on January 20th at noon. The Constitution is clear on this.

I know Trump didn't write this!We can wait until ~after~ November 3 to let them know we don’t buy their act. Let them drown Trump, then we’ll drown them.
“...he was hospitalised less than two weeks after attending the US president’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on 20 June.   Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was photographed at the event without a face mask and not physically distancing..”
I am less a fence-sitter than a strategic player. Let them distance themselves from Trump. Win landslides in November. Take huge margins in both houses of Congress, and the Presidency, and as many statehouses as possible. THEN make them all pay.
Obviously, include: - J Kushner - McConnell - Flynn - Bannon - A Jones - Sekulow - Giuliani - Mulvaney - Manafort - DeVos - The GOP Senators who acquitted Trump - All the people who refused to testify in the Mueller investigation and the impeachment hearings. - Scott Pruitt
This strikes me as a very serious misunderstanding of scale.   Trump is directly responsible for more American deaths than any war but the Civil War and WWII.   His goons are kidnapping people in unmarked vans, without badges.   He’s talking of postponing the election.
You better read this pre-COVID (Feb ‘20) piece in Forbes. You got it ALL wrong, honey. In fact, Trump was running the economy in the ground.
The Trump Magat Regime, enabled by the GOP, is a hate group.
Not Trump era, but I still want to know if  won the Senate election at the end of Season 2 of
It would also apply to nominations. This is a way to invigorate the majority, but force it to concentrate its attention on the most pressing issues while still giving the minority a voice. For example, would probably force Trump to either sign or veto a minimum wage increase now.
Trump campaign halts ad spending as president prepares to resign.
Please. Save us the indignation and crocodile tears. You have supported Trump through each and every screw up and now all you are doing is covering for your previous position that he wouldn’t postpone the election. You got caught with your pants down. Admit it
I was just talking about this with a friend. I’m wondering why Trump has 5-6 “friends” who died of cv if HCQ is the cure. Maybe they weren’t friends? Driving me crazy, can’t believe anything or anyone. Ugh.
This tweet is factually incorrect on many levels. 1) Orin Kerr didn’t write the op ed; Steven Calabresi did (the tweet says “Steven Calabresi” 2) Orin is not the “co-chair” of the Federalist Society, a position that I don’t believe exists 3) Kerr is an outspoken Trump critic
With Trump's "just asking???" tweet this morning, together with all the times he's "joked" about it before, we can see the coming battle for a peaceful, fair election.
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
Masterful usage of language and double entendres in this article! (And, not just talking about “impotent,” many more witty, subtle call outs of his core.
I think there’s even odds he quits if he loses badly enough. Trump is not a fighter. He’s walked away from everything that ever got hard. I can see his ego getting wounded enough that he just leaves the WH and holes up in Mar-a-Lago for the lame duck session.
Throwback to yesterday when not a single guest on NPR's  would say Trump was a fascist.
In honor of John Lewis, let's make Donald Trump the LAST racist president.
Interesting. I wonder whether it is because folks on the left rang the “delay the election” alarm bell before Trump actually said it—then folks on the right were able to say that was clear evidence of Trump Derangement Syndrome because Trump’d never do/say something so awful...
That’s why Trump wants it. Check and see if he or family are tied in with stocks.
Traitor Trump got it wrong!  Dead wrong!  Dead to the tune of more than 120,000 unnecessary deaths.  The Obama administration left a detailed playbook on the epidemic which was discarded.  This lack of action has led to tens of thousands of needless deaths...and counting!
Wow!  It’s not every day that our president utters a non-false statement.    Out of 821 statements checked by  this is Trump Truth Number … 35!   source:
I suppose the liberals want the building of a new FBI headquarters...which will help one of Trump's businesses or perhaps they really wanted the $1,000,000,000 funding for fighter jets and another $1,000,000,000 for other military aircraft.  Blame this on the liberals!!
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
You’ve got Calabresi calling for Trump’s immediate impeachment, conservative Trump defender  calling it the most undemocratic action ever by a president,  saying elections will be held on time.  And  says “talk to my staff.”  Courage.
There goes 10% of Trump's black support. Hopefully the other nine folks will wear masks, observe social distancing, and wash their hands regularly.
Trump’s America. “What have you got to lose?” #TrumpDestroyedAmerica
Well, you MUST have problems with these then, right?   Oh, but these are ok with you.  😂🤣🤣😂.  Elon wasn’t on his plane but TRUMP WAS.   lmao.

So...Everyone has spent the day talking about Trump's threat to postpone elections--something he doesn't even have the power to do--instead of talking about the economy. See how that works? 😔
Wow.  "Bureau employees grew so concerned...they secreted at least 3 copies of key documents, including Comey's memos, in remote locations around the Bureau" to ensure "the documents could always be preserved, located, &amp; shared."
And that it's quite likely that he contracted it at a Trump rally.
Now things get really dangerous with Trump. He's starting to panic, see unavoidable loss at the polls. Which means he will strike out even more aggressively in every which way.
Tony Tata’s ambitions are thwarted again.   He aimed to run for Congress until our 2015  story revealed adulteries &amp; a ‘pattern of misconduct’ in his Army career.   His pungent Twitter &amp; Fox commentary made him a natural Trump pick - until he went too far.   #ncpol
If you are not alarmed by Donald Trump calling to move the election, you are not paying attention.
Idea: rename Alcatraz to Alcatrump, build a 200 foot “border wall” with no door in it around the island and exile Trump there forever and ever.

is weak and belongs lock, stock, and barrel to Donald J Trump. Of course, there will not be a delay in the election. You should have said that the first time, Senator. There is a reason that you are being trounced by Cunningham in NC. Sad, ineffectual, scared.
So  wants to get rid of 1) voting 2) mail 3) mail-in ballots?  Seems simpler to just instead 4. vote Trump out of office using mail-in ballots sent through the mail.
Donald Trump should Resign. Pass it on. And if he doesn't #WeWillVote
So sad your boss’s massive ego killed him. Had to get Tulsa seats filled to watch Trump sip water and show his ramp-walking skills.
In a tweet today, President Trump mused about delaying the 2020 election.  Many of the president's claims about voting by mail are not accurate. Trump also does not have the power himself to move the date of the election.  More, from

A good chunk of Trump’s voters think likewise I guess.
Trump's tweet about delaying the election is a distraction tactic meant to hide the worst quarterly economic numbers in our nation's history.

If Hillary couldn't beat Trump. Why in the world do people think that Joe Biden will? This is his 3rd time running for president. 😬🤔
I thought this too, but I double checked and I’m fairly sure that he was positive at Trump’s rally but didn’t get it there. Which might be worse.
The great embarrassment has already happened (trump being president at all). The sooner we elect a competent leader ( the better...
Herman Cain, a Black man who was a go hard for Trump, got Covid at a Trump rally, and died from said Covid!! All for a man who doesn’t give a f*ck about Herman Cain or anyone who looks like him. Talk about the fullest of circles.
Indeed. A few of us covered this three years ago
buzzinga... Trump got you again!
Please let this be the one time the GOP will stand up to Trump.
Sad and could have been avoided. More blood on Trump’s hands.
One way or another, Trump aims to undermine our election. It's why he insists he's leading when EVERY poll says otherwise. He said his internal polls show him in the lead. They don't. But by saying so, he's convincing his followers that if he doesn't win the election is "rigged".
Ok so Herman Cain bites it from Corona he got in Tulsa and first thing Trump tweets (after suggesting delaying the election) is to go try some pizza shop in Long Island? Is that a good tier shit post???
Remember when the GOP aholes said Trump would pivot to the middle once he became president? What a joke. Never in our history has one man tried so hard to divide it at every possible opportunity. Rich vs poor, black vs white, blue vs red, etc etc etc. #UnitedWeStandDividedWeFall
Racist Trump gonna racist
It's clear now that Trump is engaged in active treason by attempting to delegitimize our electoral system.  EVERY Republican who allows a suggestion of delaying the election to stand unchallenged is complicit in treason.
Here's the problem: if the people in power are complicit in breaking the law, if there's no meaningful enforcement, then the law is just words on paper. Who runs the election? Will they be complicit with Trump, or will they obey the law? Who can/will make them obey the law?
I've been detailing how Trump has been trying to consolidate power in the executive branch. He's stacking the courts with loyalists, ignoring them when they aren't in his pocket, and circumventing Congress's authority. If you still doubted his authoritarian agenda, here's proof.
Another news cycle spent talking about what Trump wants to talk about
Help Me Find Trump’s ‘Anarchists’ in Portland
It has been very obvious since like February or March that Trump was mishandling this situation, in part, to demand the election be delayed. Like this is not surprising... right out of the fascism handbook
I said at the top of the pandemic that this was going to be Trump’s end goal and here we are lol
The problem with trying to criticize the “anti-Trump fever swamps” is that Trump will sometimes completely vindicate awful tinfoil-hat sounding claims.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting...
In which Trump tries to deflect attention by stirring up 💩 about elections...  His chance of re-election hinges on the economy and yet:  ***3 Months Of Hell: U.S. Economy Drops 32.9%, In Worst GDP Report Ever***  #Biden2020
Important point: even though Black parents are often least served by remote education that schools have implemented because of #COVID19 many of these parents express reluctance to send their kids to schools reopened w/ in-person learning.
Been waiting for this one... Legal question - does delaying an election automatically lengthen his term? Or would their be an interim appointed between end of Trump and new elections? Obviously Trump is queuing up to keep himself in the Oval...
Why on earth would Trump choose this morning to finally tweet out loud that we need to "delay the election"?
"The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration."  There are limits to presidential power, even for Trump.
I'm sure Trump will react to this news with prudence, equanimity and self-reflection.
Regarding universal mail-in voting...

Trump is a big bag of wind. He also conveniently forgets that Russians paid bounties on our soldiers and he hasn’t done a damn thing yet.
Because he is scared of retaliation.  It couldn’t be more obvious Putin holds the keys on the beta Trump.  The questions is, why? 🤔
'The Fight' Goes Behind The Scenes Of Pivotal Legal Battles Against Trump | HuffPost
“As the US passed another somber landmark, with more than 150,000 confirmed deaths from Covid-19, the grim toll stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump’s repeated promise that under his leadership the disease would simply disappear.”
The Trump campaign, and the few Black people on their payroll, are trying hard to convince voters that Dems are the REAL racists &amp; that the Trump presidency benefits African Americans.  If you know anyone swallowing that BS, ask them one question:  Who are the Klan voting for?
Fair question, considering the Trump campaign has gotten caught trying to buy Black votes.
“All of our scenarios ended in both street-level violence and political impasse,” said Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown law professor and former Defense Department official. "The law is ... almost helpless against a president who’s willing to ignore it.”
Maybe Sarah Palin will volunteer to campaign there for Trump.
I’d prefer it if Trump &amp; gang did not earn money off of the FBI. No way should he have a hand or the smallest role in anything to do with Justice. Who would choose the contractors? Potential disaster.
What a mighty God we serve!  God bless Trump!
Loving  with   This one with  is excellent.
I always think about how bad I would be as a President because I have narcolepsy and other disabilities that require me to take tons of downtime. I’d *still* be better than Trump, because I’d staff well and listen to expertise.  Narcoleptic &gt; Narcissist
I mean sure this doesn't speak to how the trump admin literwlly supports the protestors tho. Alright.
Seriously  You seem like you have brain cells. Why aren’t they working? You have to want better for the country than Trump. And that’s basically anybody but Trump.
I'm starting to suspect that this Donald Trump guy is racist.
Trump's biggest flaw is an absolute refusal to acknowledge his flaws. If he did, he could correct for them. As it is, they will be his downfall.
Trump’s secret campaign spending — including to the significant others of his adult sons — is the subject of a Federal Election Commission complaint.  via

Trump's changes to #NEPA would be devastating to community voices and our natural environment.  Glad to be part of this movement fighting back. #ProtectYourVoice
Wow, what a great opinion piece...  We Lost the Battle for the Republican Party’s Soul Long Ago
We will need a purging of lots of government agencies to remove the stench, mismanagement, and illegal shit that were instituted during the Trump misadministration.
Besides the chaos and destruction this will cause, how does this help Republicans? Trump is saying that it’s the Democrats that don’t want to deal but Dems had a plan submitted in May. Republicans scrambled to get something terrible hobbled together.
I always think Trump is the dumbest guy in Washington and then Louie Gohmert opens his mouth and proves me wrong.
Most Republicans, including those in Congress, are apparently happy to let Trump become an authoritarian leader as long as his authoritarianism has a social conservative [*cough* white supremacist] flavor. They won't stop him. So we have to stop him by voting him out.
Doing great! Yes Donald Trump even out of his mind. Dont let me bother you
The answer is in plain sight. Stone threatened to reveal what he knows about the evil deeds of Donald Trump and 30 minutes later, Trump commutes him.
The number one danger of the Trump administration is its insidious consolidation of power in the executive branch. Concerns about a shift to authoritarianism aren't hyperbole. It's already underway. This should terrify you regardless of ideology.
45 saying out loud what some in Chapel Hill believe, but don't say out loud (and some who do) amazing how close to Trump some liberals here sound
Politically, Trump would pick Durham as the Very Blue city that needs 'cleaning up'.
And by association, since poor folks are disproportionally black, latino, and other people of color, Trump is continuing to push segregation.  Same old, same old.
Oh, look. A Trump tweet from 1955.
Everytime I see this graph I'm thankful we have Donald Trump for President.  Trump is a real POTUS!!
I wonder how long that lasts after Trump, both for policy and demographic reasons.
When Trump goes to prison, property values there will plummet. #TrumpRacism
You’re absolutely right. Trump has to go. Please get all of your fellow patients at the inpatient mental health facility to vote for Biden.
YES. Not to mention the fact that Trump is a lifelong quitter who has never fought for anything, ever. He’s literally walked away from everything in his life that’s been the least bit difficult - marriages, businesses, tv shows. When he loses, he’ll leave. He’s not a fighter.
Evidence #765,139,228 of Trump’s racism.
"USA TODAY: Federal agents deploying to Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee"  Trump is trying to make the so-called battleground states true battlegrounds.
Still going, right?  Since it's a hoax, Trump has nothing to fear.  Again, right?
I think this conversation has run its course. It's just weird that you're trying to make the point that anyone said it would be impossible to maintain 2.4% GDP growth. Trump did not run on "the economy will be the exact same."
I was referencing the last three years of the Obama presidency, at which point the recession was four years past.  Nobody said Trump couldn't keep up those growth rates, Trump claimed he could get 5.
Trump has to get his new orders from Putin.
A reminder that with Trump, Russia's interest holds a &gt;50% interest that the US; and the Putin father-figure psychology and what Putin knows about Trump means Trump is co-opted. Also, many things indicate that Trump's next big goal in life is a Trump-Moscow hotel.
Trump rewrites history to fit his limited knowledge.
Did the Trump campaign make an indiscriminate ad buy on YouTube, or are they specifically targeting folks who watch yoga videos? How many people want to make America great again and also want some intense low back stretches and shoulder openers?
Trump didn't do anything anyone said was "impossible." The economy grew at 2.4% per year in his first three years, the literal exact same rate it grew in the last three years of the Obama presidency.  Job growth was actually worse under Trump. Rate of wage growth was even too.
If you don’t wanna vote, fine. I’m not even gonna try to sell you on Biden. That’s not my job. But assuming you wish to vote out Trump, this is your chance to do so. Act accordingly
Hi, Jada this is Scotland, how are you? I just got off work little while ago. My boss and I got an estimate for a house we are going to be working on.  But any Trump out of his mind.

To be fair, does any sane person think Trump would or could respond any other way? I guess I am just surprised that he didn’t throw in some self-congratulatory remark. #TrumpTreason
So you watch this video....and instead of addressing his literal nonsense talk, you want to discuss Trump. To be clear. You are comfortable with this man representing 350m people and in charge if foreign affairs?
That’s cause they are true conservatives. Once Trump is fired they will revert to rebuilding the Republican party.
Good morning! What have y'all done so far today?

Off the grid mini farm to prepare in case Trump gets re-elected. Although I think that’s highly unlikely 😉
I’m not a fan of Jonathan Swan. With that being said, his interview with trump is excellent. Swan truly reveals trumps stupidity along with his allegiance to putin and Russia.
He has a loyalist as postmaster who is slowing down mail service. Who knows what else he is capable of, not delivering mail in ballots, losing ballots, replacing ballots? If Trump let’s USPS fail he will privatize with a loyalist who could do the same.
trump and Putin stole an election, now they’re trying to steal a country.
So far this morning I’ve spotted a Little Blue Heron, a Green Heron, a Snowy Egret and a horse’s ass (trump supporter).
Anyone who believes voting by mail promotes fraud should be prohibited from doing so. Mr. Trump should be required to vote in person.

AHHHHHH this is how you fucking interview Trump.
Every day the anti-Trump advertising gets more powerful. And every day, the criminal in chief is one day closer to a prison cell.  your days are growing short.
If it's classified as a bar, you're correct.  But there are restaurants that are classified as restaurants but have full (crowded)bars that get crowded. Not sure why you're being sarcastic- love Trump all you want but this is not political, everyone is at risk.
Still, interested to see what you come up with
Anything could happen, but the lack of significant historical structural change thru voting has not been the result of chance, but rather by specific design. Those in power have vested interest in maintaining the status quo, hence the need for more drastic action to enact change.
You mean to clarify his “it depends” ?  😂. The funny thing is you guys claim to be the patriots. You’re quite OK with foreign interference if it helps Trump. Look, I’m a old Republican as well, you would be INCENSED if the roles were flipped. AND THEY WILL IF NOT HANDLED NOW.

Quoting Michelle Goldberg with great humility and sincerity, “I’m genuinely grateful for the moral courage and concrete political work of anti-Trump conservatives. ..
Yep. I'll bet you a lot of his supporters are donating multiple times so they can be part of all those special "clubs". Like the one that promises to reward you by sending you more emails. Or the one where Trump will be "walking through" the "Hall of Fame" looking for your name.
They range from scammier versions of normal political fundraising emails (donate to win dinner with Trump, but he's specially selected you for double entry if you donate NOW) to variations on phishing scams, infomercial grifts, and telemarketing cons.
I would frankly love to see an Idaho poll right now. Have you seen the PPP Montana poll that just came out? I want to see South Dakota and Wyoming, too.  Biden’s not going to win there, but Trump’s not up 20, either.
I also get emails that I've been specially selected (by Trump himself!) to buy a special hat, but I have to act fast because there are only 200 of them. My favorite was the one saying I was specially selected to get a FREE hat if I donate $35 (the cost of a hat on the website).
Yep. They send at least 4-5 emails a day. I've been repeatedly offered, if I donate, a chance to become an "official Trump 2020 Presidential Founder", join the "Trump 100 Club", the "Honor Roll", the "Hall of Fame", the "Trump Gold Card Club". None of which are actually anything.
Trump will be nominated in #Charlotte. Site for acceptance speech? ? He’s keeping his plans quiet. #ncpol
This photo of me, unearthed today while cleaning out our attic, protesting the Vietnam War, caused a major rift between my father, a retired Air Force Major,  and me. America was polarized then, but polarization &amp; hatred have metastasized under the combined rule of Trump/ Putin.
That’s not the voice of Satan. That’s just a trump “press conference”Remember, what Trump says doesn't matter, because he's speaking out of dementia and he's constantly lying. It's whether Barr and others will try to make his lies come true that is the concern. I think Trump's words here are just his usual meaningless word salad.
The governor can call up the Guard if she wants. I don't know how bad that would be politically, or democratically, to do that. But I'd sure love to see it.  I don't think there's any way Trump can take control of her Guard. He really doesn't understand this stuff.
Isn’t it? I just couldn’t bear it - couldn’t break the spell I was under after absorbing every word President Obama spoke. I turned Trump off after just one word.
Trump and DHS are really pushing back but Oregon and Portland are only getting more determined and more angry, which is the exact right answer. I'm looking for Portland news tonight, so far I don't see whether feds are still there or not.
Born-again fiscal conservatives are sign of Trump’s weakening hand in Congress
Seems that many did not see or pay much attention. I read last month that McConnell told GOP if Trump did not change message by Labor Day they could basically do what they had to do to save their seat.  It was reported McConnell leaked this.
Trump is talking out his ass. The Guard has already stated, and proved, that they will NOT take action against protesters. They have none of the leeway the  has, they can't and won't do anything close to what Trump would want. The Guard thing is just more Trump ignorance.
I've often thought of this; Dems were all about Trump not accepting the outcome.   I hope the return of this issue is not a bad omen.
Many working class Americans , particularly those in the construction industry , feel betrayed by Trump . Wages remain depressed , and illegals remain on most every job site.
Let it be known... we warned you. We knew this was going to get dangerous, and it did.
I’m glad we copied Trump as well...as if he actually reads anything that isn’t written with a sharpie...sorry John last thing twitter needs is more politics....
"May Send National Guard to Oregon." Ok, I literally LOL'd at that. Trump has NO IDEA how the military works.  How do you "send in" a force that is already stationed there? Is he "sending in" other states' Guards? That would make NO sense, and NO states would do that. 1/
Look at 2016 my man. The average of polls was off by 1.2 points from the final result. If that were the case today, Biden would win the popular vote by 7.1 points. No way Trump eeks out an electoral college win with that margin.
The first I heard about goggles was a liberal reporter asking Fauci about goggles and Fauci said not a bad idea...then it turns into “Fauci says everyone should wear goggles.” Liberal reporters trying to influence medical decisions to make people more miserable to hurt Trump.
Trump simply could not tolerate another day of the nation focused on someone other than him (a black man!).    So, with one tweet, we're  talking about him again.  Mission accomplished.

Every media clown out today praising Obama for a 5 minute speech acting like he wasn’t the one that bailed out the evil corporations we’re stuck fighting today, and headed a truly inept department of justice that was unable to pin a blatantly corrupt trump campaign. 🤡
Anyone think that maybe Trump is actually trying to get us all to vote by mail so he can have those ballots tampered with? I’m about half joking. But vote in person if you can and feel comfortable
He's a Republican, he does not care!!  Just like trump!!!  All Republicans are like that... they don't care about Americans.
I wish I could retweet this to infinity. Election Day cannot get here soon enough. I am actually afraid of what trump will try. We have so little in checks and balances left. Thank God for our position in the House.
2.2 million were supposed to die. 150,000 is considerably less than 2.2 million. Ban on flights coming from China, Europe. Biden said Trump was wrong for that for two months. Nancy and Bill telling everyone to go out and have fun in enclosed spaces. Your hate is misguided.
Trump floats idea of November election delay, a virtual impossibility
So was stumping for Trump an exchange for a pardon????
I can’t stand Hollywood.  I just finished the Epstein doc on Netflix.  It TRIED to tie Trump to Epstein (failing miserably), and did not include a SINGLE GD interview or mention of the accuser who says Epstein &amp; Maxwell sold her to John McCain and Joe Biden through a DC madam...
Trump tweeting about Herman Cain's death
So, like Trump. Got it. 😂
Donald Trump?
Trump just could not stand another day of the nation talking about John Lewis -- and just like that, with one tweet, the nation is, once again, talking about Trump.
Whose fault was it that the stockpile was depleted after 3 years of Trump? His party had control of both houses until 2018. We sent supplies to China in January, we didnt order extra or build out our capabilities. Still havent used DPA for masks. Abject failure.
Look around the world. Nobody is doing worse than us right now. Economically, death toll, number of cases, pretty much any measure you choose. Bush stopped SARS, Obama stopped Ebola. Trump failed, no way around it.
Trump has turned us into a Socialist country. Farmers and businesses were being given payments well before covid due to the trade war. Stimulus payouts, fixed drug pricing. We look more like Venezuela now that we ever have.
Why Aunty Em would vote for Trump.... (1/2500)
Like I said. Keep believing Biden's 8-point lead isn't real. You probably don't even need to vote since Trump will win so easily.
Since Trump thinks it'll be too unsafe in November, Chris Cuomo suggests we vote right away!   Let's say next Tuesday, everybody gets the day off, and we'll even call it #TrumpDay.   I am so there.
Our Crooked Fake President Trump whose Father is now Putin ( is totally responsible for the GDP falling 32.9%.

How Donald Trump Shifted Kids-Cancer Charity Money Into His Business
Trump, McConnell and the really stupid guy at our marina.
I don't know if I'd say Kansas is the tipping point for control of the Senate. More likely it comes down to two of these three states: Iowa, North Carolina, and Maine.
Oh god y’all have no idea.  Fake new and fake polls.  All leftist propaganda.  Democrats have completely shown their ass the last 3.5 years.  Half my Democrat friends voting Trump secretly.  Like I said, get your popcorn ready Nov. 3rd.  Gonna be a LONG night for you.
Trump calls it winning.
Wait, you think if Trump was ahead in the polls then he might NOT float the idea of delaying the election? Weird....
Trump isn't a conservative.  Regardless, your conspiracy theories are baseless, asinine, and dangerous.
Jared Kushner’s coronavirus task force decided to ignore a nationwide effort because only blue states had the virus - Apparently there is no bottom to how evil the Trump crime family can be! #TrumpCrimeFamily #JaredGoringKushner
It's at once reassuring and terrifying that Trump is following a well-worn playbook.  Reassuring because we know what's coming. Terrifying because so many have gotten away with it.  #Election2020
Flash forward 10 years from now and replace Bush with Trump. It’ll be no different.
Trump doesn't want to control healthcare, that's your party. "You'll be able to keep your doctor" (lie) remember?
⁦ says he can't assure school safety amid pandemic, in other words, #Trump cares nothing about putting your kids and family at increased risk of #COVID19 ⁦ ⁦ ⁦ #ncga #ncpol ⁦
How about Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump.  Would either of them have a job without Daddy.  I thought not...
Army Ranger and lifelong Republican tells you why he's not voting for Trump
Bingo!!  Now the Marxist Dems can't move the goal posts because of COVID-19 or some other Voter issue, Nov 3rd. Trump is an effective chess player!  He Trumped them again.
Wah wah wah, let's all blame Trump
With Trump donor in charge, Postal Service may shut locations and cut service before Election Day
I was just wondering why this was the one thing that's making GOP speak up against Trump. Now I understand - sounds like it would almost certainly benefit Dems. Silly me for thinking, "Do Republicans actually care sometimes about the Constitution?" Nope.
The Left will incorrectly blame this on Trump.  On the other hand, other than mail-in, what's the alternative?
No doubt Trump talks to Vlad more than he does to his campaign manager
Demcast Joins “Protect the Results” Coalition To Mobilize Americans If Trump Refuses To Concede  #DemCast #Focus14
I read a month or so ago that if Trump didn't get on message by Labor Day  McConnell was giving the okay for GOP to move away from him. Reported that he leaked this info.
And the Media instantly fell for it; how they love every glittering shiny little object Trump tosses their way.
So if my family believes in racism, you know they support Trump. And the elimination of this rule is reprehensible. Just like Trump. When people show you who they are, believe them. Trump is who he has shown us: ignorant, racist, traitor, criminal, amoral, and unrepentant.
Trump.
So trump deadass trynna move the Election Day
Is your life goal really to be a couch potato who does nothing but defend trump all day
FUCK TRUMP.   That is all.
People really wana act like everything prior to 2016 was perfect &amp; Trump turned back the clock to the 1800s during his tenure.
I used to wish that Trump would die - like every day.    Now I hope he lives a long life - in prison, humiliated, on constant suicide watch so he has to stay alive in his misery for many years.   #WorstPersonEver #TrumpSux
She and I were VASTLY outnumbered by our white family members voting for Trump. We’re both white. Yep. Most of the white people I know voted Trump.
I am the only one in my family who didn’t vote for Trump. Well, me and my step-sis
Intolerant Leftist Mob Tries to Bankrupt Long Island's Patio Pizza Joint for Supporting Trump - But it Backfires Tremendously! (VIDEO)  via
It was reported on....
Trump is using Argumentum Absurdum to ensure Election Day occurs on time.  People should know him by now.  I do think tweeting something like that is not helpful and wish he would be more thoughtful sometimes.   On a good note he is the most open book of any politician.
I don't worry about Trump's tweets. It's funny to watch people freak out about them.

Just because you don’t like the news doesn’t make it fake.   And of course Trump’s pro China. China gave Ivanka Seven patents and all of his merchandise is made their.  Along with his ties, etc.
Kamala Harris will offer to debate Trump
Trump could win again
There was nothing violent happening in Lafayette Park when the goons - sorry, feds - came in to push people out of the way and gas them so Trump could have a photo op.
Gonna be a wild 3 months of watching the right calculate their personal best strategy. A handful will go down into the Fuhrerbunker with trump; most will say “Fuck this, let’s go surrender to some Americans”
I’m starting to think Washington and big tech have secretly discovered that Hydroxychloroquine is actually the cure for Trump Derangement Syndrome and once you take it you automatically become a Trump supporter and immune to mind control
The former Deceiver in Chief, Obama up to no good again with his mission to bring down Trump Admin with his Marxist Lts all across the Judiciary, MSM, Educ, Corp, Antifa, BLM,etc mestasticized into all out assault on America, ROL and its constitution. Will we survive?
This man is absolutely everything our country was founded against. #AnyoneButTrump2020
Harwood makes a point of mentioning that Cain attended Trump’s Tulsa rally.  Harwood is a liberal partisan hack.
So you agree then? Trump supporters are trash.
Republicans politicized COVID? 😂 I’m sorry, who started an all out smear campaign on a generic drug (that’s safer than aspirin!) all because Trump said it was showing positive results?!
You mean like those Trump supporters when he supports China re-education “factories”?
It's all up to us if we want to allow Trump to "cancel" or "postpone" the election, or let him try to contest the results. When Biden wins an overwhelming victory on election night, which will be held on Tuesday, November 3rd, and then he will be inaugurated in January, period.
Trump Tries to Move Election Day!  via
gestapo working with The Proud Boys. This is EXACTLY the kind of racism #BLM is waking us up to and these are Trump's people.
Fuck Donald Trump and fuck you for believing his take on protests over REAL FUCKING PROTESTORS IN THE STREETS FOR LITERAL MONTHS 🖕🏼
Where was Trump today for John Lewis funereal? The last three presidents were there.  I never thought I would say this I miss Bush as President and when he was in office he said that a big virus would be here one day
15 times Trump praised China as coronavirus was spreading across the globe   #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
You'd need Trump money, lol
Incredible they are all willing to sacrifice everything for Trump as he burns the house down.
Trump needs to learn how to pronounce Oregon and Plasma first ....
You want to provide liabilty protection to employers.  Meaning you can get hurt or killed due to your employer’s negligence and have no recourse.  Take heed, trump supporters.  Don’t be a Herman Cain.  #RIPHermanCain
We all wish, Trump needs to resign. Walk away before it's too late.
Here is what you should take away: Trump doesn’t have the authority to postpone the election. And thank goodness. Because our economy can’t handle another four years of diversions &amp; broken promises.
Here are the facts:  👉🏽 Voting by mail is safe and secure. 👉🏽 There IS a “process” in place to vote by mail.  👉🏽 Trump votes by mail.  👉🏽 Republicans are encouraging other Republicans to vote by mail.
Kentucky is really red but it only went for Trump by 30 points. In contrast, Hillary Clinton won Minnesota's 5th District by 55 points.
Agree!!  I’m with Trump 2020
The tRump Depression. Always #1 as he promised. Top Loser in economics.
Was this before or after the trump bashing? Political shit at a wake is bad class
Ok, that I would believe. But remember as #Trump famously noted, there are good people on all sides right?  Why should a #photographer be assaulted just for taking pictures of it all?
Funny how none of the GOP started speaking out against Trump until the primaries were over 🤔
Disgusting, sociopathic, but not surprising. Kushner should be put on trial for deliberately scuttling testing plans on the grounds that the virus, by having a greater impact on blue states, would be politically advantageous to republicans and Trump. #onev1
It's especially fun when Trump supporters rush to say Trump was joking and then a day later Trump says he wasn't joking.
So did Trump folks kill Herman Cain to rally around China Virus???
Did you really just sit there and let Trump politicize the man death who you was so livid over earlier ????
You crack me up
When are you going to hold the Trump administration accountable?
Makes me realize you blindly follow trump and don't listen to the lies, nonsense, and utter insanity he says.
No worries. Trump’s just throwing around Twitter excrement in order to distract from:  RECORD NEGATIVE 32 PERCENT 2nd Quarter GDP.  1.4 MILLION NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS  And Trump backing the “DEMON DOCTOR” in his last Press Conference where he beat another hasty exit.
Thank you. #Trump #MadeAmericaTrash
A leader of the Federalist Society. #ncpol Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
It's going to be really awkward on January 20, 2021 when Trump refuses to concede his presidency and the secret service has to physically remove him from the White House while he live tweets that the media and Democrats falsified the election results...
What you claim isn't necessarily what you are..  #Trump for example is a terrible #conservative, he's more #authoritarian corporatist, w some #ethnocentric undertones
Save America from what, Trump? How does that work exactly?
Did he talk about how he spied on Trump? #ObamaGateIsReal
You sound angry. Reagan said we have opponents not enemies. Trump has betrayed the Republican Party. He and his enablers must be purged. Get out of the way.
2020 Prediction: After getting routed in November election, Trump reveals he’s been a secret Democratic plant this entire time with the express purpose of destroying the Republican Party from the inside. He is successful.
Has trump acknowledged Herman Cane’s death?

Yup. It’s a good thing that Trump told China that those Muslim “re-education” prisons were okay with him, right?
Steven Calabresi will vote for Donald Trump in November. He will release a statement regarding some innocuous, dem boiler plate thing Biden says as a reason , that despite Trumps personal abhorrence, the radical agenda of Biden is just too dangerous for the nation to endure.
When I see a Trump sign it looks like a good place to take a piss.
Trump sexuals
So do you teally think Bill Barr will indict or allow any US attorney to indict any Trump campaign member, surrogate or otherwise Trump agent for this or any other criminal act?
We need an Independent counsel or panel to investigate this disaster after Trump is out of office.
You are an embarrassment to all Americans who died to defeat Hitler and his accolade tRump.
Y’all, when THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY calls for the impeachment of Trump based upon his election postponement ideas, that’s pretty watershed.  I know we keep thinking and hoping each thing will be enough to stop him and it’s not, but the fact the right of the right are done is shock
I do not want to vote for Trump or Biden... need another option. #vote
You mean like the Trump rally Herman Cain caught the China Virus at???
If a Democrat would have been in the White House with this virus I can only imagine the devastation the US would be in. Trump handled it with success. The best he could with what he had. And fighting the Dems everyday trying to be president too
bet Trump is glad you didn't vote for hermain cain
. traffics in fear and projection. He completely lost the plot, which is pretty much the GOP path under Trump: total soul-selling.
I agree..they will do anything evil to keep the real President out of office..we the people vote President Trump 2020 and we demand a fair election..
A cis hetero white man told me to relax about Trump's tweet about delaying the election. That it's "amusing." And the last 3 presidents said similar. And he tweeted it to get the reaction he got.   I really hate white men sometimes.
Trump’s Drug Price Control Orders Are Bound to Backfire
Please vote for Joe Biden in November so we can figure out what the next best steps are for this country. Because another four years of Trump will be when the real nightmare begins.
Baron Trump is in danger of harm. His school is not fully reopening.  When will the grifters Donald and Melania move their son to a school that is fully reopening?
Undermining the validity of our elections is possibly the most destructive thing Trump has done, which is really saying something.
You don’t like those people’s politics. How are those people under minding our democracy?  And how is the Joe Biden nomination anything like the trump nomination? One a former VP, former longtime senator; they other a reality TV show host.
Great point! China wants to take trump out
The population of NZ is 4.8 million, less than NYC which is the blue city in a blue state who went against everything Trump said and they had the worst response in the US.

Three former literate Presidents spoke before Trump today, and a fourth provided a written text of remark in complete sentences. Someone thought letting Trump open his mouth on camera today was a good thing?
Trump absurdly claims keeping people home in order to try to stop the spread is likely causing more death than COVID-19.

Under Trump, we had a 32% drop in our GDP the last quarter. Congratulations, no President has managed to screw our economy worse than you have!
Trump successfully changed the conversation today and took attention away from the terrible economic report.  We fall for it every time.

The President is under funding the United States Postal Service to deny mail in ballots. The President and staff mail in their ballots. Trump trusts himself, but not the American voters.
When the founder of the Federalist calls for Trump’s immediate impeachment 😳😳😳
You do realized trump has changed his party affiliation 5 times since ‘88 He actually was a democrat and then independent before he ran on the Republican ticket so really who is the RINO? Trump only cares about his self interest that’s no party affiliation ideal whatsoever.
So the company, Modena, Trump gave $1B to develop a COVID vaccine wants ti charge $50 per treatment.  And Moderna stock is up 350%  I wonder how much Moderna stock the #TrumpCrimeFamily own  So much for lowering drug costs

Thank God Trump didn't honor John Lewis, he would have made a nasty, trashy self-promoting debacle of it.
Def prefer being mad at Obama for his shortcomings than Trump and his.
Trump votes by mail you colossal tool.   There's no cases of widespread vote by mail fraud. And the most recent cases have been by Republicans and caught and corrected.
All things that have NEVER happened and are created by the liar-in-chief.  He creates more boogeymen than Stephen King.  Protect it from any fraud, like any election, and don’t act like trump is above cheating.
Yes, but senator, patriots need to know that you’re 100% behind Trump. A lot of them were pissed off when you voted against the wall. Own up to that and you will win in a landslide
Looking forward to sending Donald Trump a simple message in November: “You’re Fired.”
I def will NOT buy Bolton’s book and def WILL  buy Mary Trump’s book but I’m on the fence about Cohen’s. What are you all thinking?

Can someone please explain to me how trump is responsible for COVID? I can’t wrap my mind around what more he could’ve done. You can’t just shut the entire country down. I may be wrong in this because I’m 14 and haven’t educated myself on the situation, so please tell me.
Navarro is a serious Trump sycophant...so of course he will profit greatly from this administration...legally-probably not 😆

Has the campaign ever been late paying Trump properties?
wow - the trump GOP looks like it may bring the end of the American experiment. Economic collapse and election theft by inaction, enabling, indifference, and ineptitude at the art of compromising for our  “commonwealth”. History will not look kindly
There's a lot to unwind. I suspect Biden will do it quickly and have a transition team in place unlike Trump in 16.  It's hard to fathom how much damage they *didn't* cause due to their ineptitude.
This guy is all deflect &amp; distract. His tweeted 16 minutes after the July numbers came out.Trump thanks to his enablers have allowed him to break all the norms.But not this time. He can't changed the date of the election only Congress can.His presidency ends it at noon on 1/20/21

Because the House Bill left out of its bill fuller tax deductions for Business Meals (like those at Trump Hotel Restaurant) or omitted renovation money to keep FBI where it is now located so a hotel that will compete w/Trump’s can’t be build? We are not stupid.
doesn’t believe that obviously but he has to counter the tugs  on his extreme guilt for being so drawn to Trump. Obama is his security blanket.
USPS has a board of governors. Supposed to be 9, down to 6, 4 were appointed by Trump. They then voted for Trump's Postmaster pick, DeJoy.  Senate, controlled by GOP, confirmed all.

Absentee voting IS mail-in voting.  Trump's desperate for in-person voting so he can use both the raging pandemic and the #AmericanGestapo to suppress voters.  #VoteByMail
There will be no military coup in support of Trump. The Pentagon has already defied him several times and he isn't nearly as popular w/ the military as ppl think.  This is why he's using  instead. But the DOD will stomp them if they try to keep Trump in office illegally.
So much for the Supreme Court decision in Nevada recently.  Why have a standard when a double Democrat standard will do.  Great country!  Dual system of Justice. Republicans are weak and feckless, not willing to make a stand. Trump is by himself, the rest hide.
Trump appointed a Postmaster who, arguably, is there to undermine it. He has ordered carriers to delay mail delivery and pick-up. This will threaten counting of votes cast by mail in states with election day deadlines for their receipt, not postmarked.
Honestly, in regards to Cain and the 150,000 that have died unnecessarily due to trumps negligence, trump should be charged with manslaughter!
🤣🤣🤣 yeah right?? I’d take a dog over trump any day and I’m Republican #NeverTrumpers
Yep. I cling to the notion of “by the people, for the people” and that we have the power to undo Trump. I’m hoping this is what separates us from Russia.

Worth watching.  Bottom line: * If HCQ + Zinc doesn’t work, it is relatively safe, cheap, and does little harm.  * If HCQ + Zinc does work, CNN and their media allies have killed THOUSANDS of Americans in order to make Trump look bad.
"I take no responsibility". Trump has no capability to feel shame.
It's also a signal that Trump isn't getting support from his party for an effort to contest the election results. Even GOP members of Congress are ready to see Trump gone.

Donald J TRUMP! YOUR NEXT! PRESIDENT! 4 MORE YEARS!
This will be Biden’s America if he’s elected!!!!!! Oh wait................this is Trump’s America and will continue to happen if he stays president
Did you place a wreath to the memories of the dead Nazis? Did you express Trump's condolences?
Trump was settling.
I don't buy for a second that he thinks he could actually do it. There was historically bad economic news out today &amp; most people are focused on the funeral of John Lewis. Horrible economic news &amp; lack of attention are two things Trump HATES. I suspect a deliberate distraction.
Where was God? Why did God not protect him from the virus as he followed the word of Trump?
It's pretty clear that the President of the United States resists facts.   To survive the #Trump administration, scientists need to invest in a strategic vision
Tillis continues his silence on the flagrant abuse and incompetence by this administration.    -  Trump’s continued failure on the pandemic response -  Russians paying Taliban to kill our soldiers - Hatch act violations in the WH rose garden - Cutting CDC access to pandemic data
She didn't, but I would take that over a sexual abuser and rapist like trump. Someone is STILL waiting on his dna
But Trump " takes no responsibility" for exposing his friend to the virus that killed him.   #TrumpGoAway
Imagine how racist your network has to be to make Obama seem like a bad President and Trump seem like a good President.
Too bad there wasn’t someway to protect himself from getting COVID19? Maybe Trump will lead the way and show America how?
Safer than Trump’s.  But I would prefer an election thank you.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Seriously?  He could make Democrats vote for Trump 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
A steady ally of President Trump, Herman Cain was seen at times w/o a mask on at Trump's Tulsa, OK rally in June, tested positive for the virus on June 29, and went to the hospital two days later.
Is this what Trump discussed with Putin instead of bounties placed on US   TROOPS this is Russian foreign policy being conducted from the White House. Putin must be so proud. How does this help the USA?
Don't you get tired of carrying trump's water? Let's remember the facts.   Flynn pled guilty multiple times Flynn pled guilty as part of a deal to not be charged with more serious crimes.   If his prosecution is dropped, he and his son can be charged for the more serious offenses
Choked back tears the entire time President Obama spoke. His voice and his genuine grief and belief in our wrestling back our Democracy through the power of good trouble and VOTING gave me hope. People this good have to win/triumph over Trump’s evil.
It would have been a speech about Trump.
Obama better at spying on Candidate Trump, drone bombing weddings and funerals, partying with his Celeb friends, and did nothing for poor Americans and Black Americans in 8 years.
Except that Trump has only escalated the drone strikes that Obama had. And then stopped reporting them because it would make him look bad
Biden didn’t make yeezy’s.... neither did trump 🤔
Well, between Trump's tweet And Obama's eulogy, There's some news today.
Coherent explanation from Trump?? You must be kidding.
I love him throwing shade at Trump
Your an order of magnitude more embarrassing to the country. Millions are looking forward to voting you out by any means they can take, in person or by mail. Mail in voter fraud is just another bullshit Trump made claim.
Baron Trump's school is not fully reopening, and no school in North Carolina should at this time either.  #ncpol
Is is not equally as possible that the coronavirus is a major threat to public health, and that it's being downplayed to affect the presidential election, to save the economy at the expense of public health, to save Trump's image? Certainly if one is possible, so is the other.
Start pushing on Joe Biden to sit for ONE interview and ask real questions. Amazing the democratic nominee gets a free pass from the media. Even  Chris Wallace asked trump hard questions, joes turn
Hating on Republicans and Trump is cheap, low-hanging fruit &amp; honestly boring. Negativity against humans in either direction doesn’t win over new supporters. Critiquing the current system with smart, insightful takes about how we can improve things for normal people is best imho
It's quite amazing. I don't think you can take away Trump's phone.
See the thing that gets me the most with trump supporters is they thing its a personality trait when in reality they just look stupid to everyone else.
Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally
The biggest issue with this upcoming election is the Supreme Court. We need trump out to preserve our rights. A vote for Biden is the only option. I won’t debate this
On an unrelated note Ryan, will you be changing the name from students for trump to students for Biden after November?
Pervert trump
Trump plays the left like fiddles. He knows and knew full well election law. He also knows how to get back on the front page by tweeting and getting millions of parties all in a bunch.
For the president, everything is politics. Trump is and he’s always been jealous of Obama and this is just another jealous response to Obama getting more positive attention then him. But why didn’t he volunteer to give a eulogy???
Here's the real reason Donald Trump is afraid of vote by mail. In North Carolina, recent bipartisan elections reforms make it easier to vote by mail. It's also led to a surge of Democrats requesting vote by mail ballots. NO delay. #ncpol
Nice try, Quisling.  Best you get back to polishing #Trump ‘s shoes. There you go. Good boy. Do it well and you’ll get your nickel. #ETTD   #HistoryWillNotBeKind
That's for Kemp and Trump.
You thought was a a democratic hoax?  Please say covid because that got debunked but you still use it as a talking point which is cute.
2) polling locations. They work to gerrymander districts into favoring them too.  They don't play fair because they can't win that way. Look at Georgia these past few years. The thing is though that Trump's polling numbers are really bad &amp; he needs kids in school, so parents can
Wearing a Mask does not prevent the Trump Virus.
Guess Trump realized that a split screen with President Obama and getting blown out in the "ratings" wasn't in Trump's best interest. Even Fox News probably would have stayed with Obama/Lewis.
You people are the ones who minimize the dangerous things that Trump says.  And you said nothing about " entertaining the notion of delaying the election", Sparky, you said "no one is taking this seriously".
y’all let several elderly Trump supporters attend
'They Predicted The Crisis of 2020...In 1991" "They" here means Neil Howe and Bill Strauss, authors of #Generations book and #FourthTurning. If you have NY Times subscription, or get a free trial subscription; you need to read this:
I agree Trump
I posted this the day before the Tulsa rally. "Today, Trump will be filming his newest campaign film "The Expendables - Tulsa Edition" I can already picture him stating "Thank You for your service" and "they have not died in vain" to those who are "dying" to see him. #RIPTulsa."
President Trump is so good trolling the fake news.
President Trump is so good at triggering the fake news.
North Carolina Retrumplican Thom Tillis is up for reelection to the US Senate in November. No matter how he tries to spin it now, he has been a zealous sycophant of Trump since the election.   Full video at
All you’ve done is a whole of nothing except apologize for trump.
Demonstrably untrue.  Why do you people even attempt this?
How much does the USPS answer to the executive branch?  Even though they are funded can Trump appointees order them to scale way back for "safety"?
Truth! Trump in 2020 to save America from the liberal left and anarchy! 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
must be in incredible shape to be able to keep climbing these trees and out on to branches that Trump then severs and laughs as Ari plunges to embarrassment again and again.
It's Trump
The media is taking the bait.  Trump is trying to distract from the abysmal July GDP numbers.  This bullshit is all you guys can talk about...WAKE UP PEOPLE.  He can't change the election..PERIOD...
Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen
Yeah, you were Never Trump in 2016.  Sure.
Already making your excuses for losing, eh Trump? You are so transparently corrupt. #FakePresident #CheaterInChief #TrumpIsAnEnemyOfAmerica #TrumpIsKillingAmericans #TrumpIsACriminalAndATraitor #TrumpHatesTheRuleOfLaw #TrumpCreatesChaosNotOrder
Herman Cain went to a trump rally, caught COVID and then died while denying the importance of a mask. I’m trying not to laugh
Not even his sycophants in Congress can support his stupid tweet about delaying elections
Preparing for a coup d’etat by cancelling the election due to COVID-19 and street violence (perpetuated by #TrumpsGestapo ) to stay in office and avoid #SDNY prosecution as his re-election is increasingly unlikely. #TrumpIsATraitor
More tRump “winning”?!  Will Americans finally decide we can’t afford more debt so as to keep the whiner businessman in WH?
Trump tweets about invading US cities with federal troops and people start disappearing off the streets into unmarked vans. Trump tweets about delaying the election and  says "Haha! You fell for the bait!"
As a member of the Trump administration and avid supporter of his party's propaganda, Cain made a point of letting people know that he thought it wasn't important to wear masks or social distance.  Now he's dead from the pandemic he so easily dismissed.  #WearADamnMask
should all that be ignored? what was said that was disrespectful? Trump has encouraged reckless behavior regarding covid. these are the logical consequences.
Trump cabinet member &amp; former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain dies after hospitalized with coronavirus
After President Trump floats the idea of delaying the general election, Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes that states that do universal mail-in ballots “get it right.”
Trump floats delaying the November election. He does not have that authority. - NPR
Loss of life is sad but...  Sometimes you choose the hill you want to die on and then you actually die on that hill...  And putting your trust in Trump is definitely one steep hill
1) Yes, you are dead wrong. 2) The pollsters in 2016 were not very far off. 3) Trump won in 2016 by essentially 80K votes.  Say goodbye to your Orange Jesus.
Here, I’ll use a source that is acceptable to you: “Election experts do say that voting by mail is more susceptible to fraud than casting a ballot in person, but they’ve seen no evidence of widespread fraud or that absentee balloting favors Democrats.”
Trump killed him.  Your buddy.
Too true #Biden has a long career of pushing institutional racism of mass incarceration &amp; authoritarian legislation like the Patriot Act &amp; the brutal, global racism of war Trump corruption was in the private sector, Biden corruption was on taxpayers
OH HELL THE FU*K NO.   via
NY Times Columnist Asks for Help Finding "Trump’s ‘Anarchists’ in Portland", Locates Them in His Own Column
1) You said the polls showed Trump was ahead, so you were just dead wrong there.  2) 2020 is not 2016, chump.
And the "feels cheated" is certainly a much more accurate assessment of the reason here, considering that the damage is mostly Trump's own failings. Much as "achievements" is also mostly in the mind of Trump and his cult members only.
Honestly think Trump is screwed in November. All the Biden campaign has to do is keep Joe from saying too much weird shit and he should win.
That’s right, Madam Speaker.  But don’t expect Trump to be any different. He hasn’t demonstrated any respect for our Constituition before now, and he won’t be reading nor respecting it any time soon.
Lets see Roy and Mandy said masks were the answer... maybe they'll have a new group to blame today,  perhaps the supporters who gathered to see Trump and Pence in town.
proving that supporting trump makes anyone UnAmerican
A fabulous thread calling out everyone who publicly scoffed at the notion that Trump would try to delay the election. Links. Great thread. Thanks for sharing,  .
STOP falling for Trump Distractions. The more outrageous his tweet or a spokesman's sound bite the more you should halt and and ponder what is going on right now that he wishes to get drowned out and lost in his noise. Remember Master Putin is Trump’s true campaign manager.
Oh, CNN, how soon you forget... In a story posted on July 30 about Trump's suggestion that the 2020 election be postponed due to the pandemic, your story stated emphatically that there was no evidence that voting by mail leads to voter fraud. But, wait, …
Chick called Trump a “Sock Monkey”😂
"Herman Cain" , one of the most successful African-American businessmen in our history, got killed off by Trump..but  somehow thinks he won't work down to the 'breadcrumbs' like him??
also can someone PLEASE link me to her video that got taken down after trump retweeted it, i have spent like 20 minutes looking for it
trump look like a fucken roach
I’m a North Carolinian who has called Senator Tillis’s office about Trump-related topics of concern a dozen times over the past year.  His staff often answer the phone and politely take your message, but I’ve never received an on-topic response.  So … I’m not hopeful.
We know you’re terrified ⁦ but you don’t have the power to change elections or stay past Jan 20 when you lose. We see your attempts-Fed agents, mil troops, kill USPS, yell “fraud” at every chance. Stop working for Russia #TrumpLoser
❤️ TRUMP
Is there a loophole in the Trump rally waiver since it doesn’t explicitly say death??? #HermanCain    Does illness or injury cover death???
All this work to eventually have Trump just pardon him.
True, true, and true. He legally can't, but so far, no one is there to stop him. The other issue, that doesn't get mentioned, is the states with a GOP-majority legislature, like mine in NC, could decide not to certify election results if Trump puts out a voting fraud theory.
I think Trump is using Argumenyum Absurdum to make a point.
Sometimes I imagine POTUS pulling up Twitter during a meeting and saying "Hey everybody, watch this!"  2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Floats Whether to ‘Delay the Election,’ Something He Cannot Legally Do - The New York Times
If tRump was a sports team I would say he is tanking.   Could he be intentionally trying to lose?
Hopefully the problem will resolve on Nov 3rd. You as a Trump supporter plus Fed buying all junk bond to make billionaires richer in equity market but cannot afford $600 for unemployed people. Your President mismanagement created this mess. Take look at Germany’s covid curve😡
Damn. Didn’t know trump held him at gun point, made him go and made him not wear a mask
That’s literally what Trump’s tans look like lmao
Trump supporters are blaming Stage 4 Colon Cancer for #HermanCain death that he got over in 2011🤔🤔🤔 #trumprally
It is, however, a powerful learning tool for everyone else. Unfortunately, the Trump cult of about 50 million dipshits is uneducable.
You know Trump can’t go one day without baiting you libs, right? So predictable y’all take the bait every single time.  Good times.
Neal, trump is already showing that he does not abide by court rulings.
Trump saying he wants to delay the election on the same day as #JohnLewis funeral is truly something else.
I would walk barefoot in a blizzard to vote trump out.  #WeWillVote
#WeWillVote  and definitely not for Trump.
Don’t forget, Herman Cain got sick after attending trumps rally that nobody showed up to. Republicans, Trump literally is killing your people.
It's amazing that Trump keeps hand picking people to run his agencies and they all want to bring him down.
It doesn't bother Trump or Repubs.... To them, that's all  just collateral damage.  It doesn't bother them one bit.
How were those quarterly numbers today?   Trump has taken us to an all-time low, but yeah, Joe Biden.
Once again, the blue checks fail to grasp the subtlety to Trump tweets and jump to faulty “orange man bad” assumptions.
He's gotten pretty chunky lately &amp; that beard of his does nothing to his face at all. What an idiot. Republicans won't get and understand that until some of their own die or someone with the last name Trump gets sick. He just sickens me.
I still don’t think he has a chance. My issue is everyone guaranteeing Trump will lose instead of, you know, telling us why they should win.   It’s just a hopeless situation rn
Trump lying about the intelligence community to protect his own interests is nothing new. There's never been a worse piece of scum in the WH, which is really saying something. #Treason
Very sad, but there will be many, many more #Trumpist deaths.  Even sadder, will any of this carnage change their minds about Golden Calf Trump??  Nope, because anyone who still follows #Trump is too goddamn stupid to be able to change.
Get your pitchforks ready.
It's been 20 days since Trump claimed he would soon be signing a "major" immigration bill that would include a road to citizenship for DACA recipients. I haven't seen one reporter ask him about this since he said it.
😂😂😂😂  Have you heard trump speak?!?!?
“Two Corinthians” “oranges” “7/11” “one million eight hundred and seventy thousand million tests” literally every time Trump opens his mouth..
Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, dies after battling coronavirus
After listening to President Bush speak today at John Lewis burial service - I ask why do we have Trump as POTUS?
You weren't elected so people could talk to your staff  If you can't speak out and say that tweet by trump was wrong then you don't deserve to be my senator.
He was spreading trump’s stupidity and he put trump over his own life likely infected others. He got what he asked for and I don’t feel a bit sorry about this news. I am done with all these stupid people.
Anyone have any numbers on how North Carolina's gross state product trended in Q2? Tanking GDP is apparently devastating for Trump so I'm wondering what if any effect it will have on Cooper's re-election chances. ...  LOL. J/K. I know that's not how this works. #NCPOL
We knew it was coming and here it is...Trump wants to delay the election!  #NovemberIsComing and like  said👇👇👇the #TrumpCrimeFamily is going to be packing up and moving out!
“Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump,” Cain tweeted. “PEOPLE ARE FED UP!”
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so.
Love you Bernie, but no.  Biden has been dead quiet this entire time while you’re the only candidate actually saying anything. And he’s the one who “won” the Primary.  Trump is going to destroy Biden in November if we all assume he’s going to lose.   Please, go out and vote.
Under the US constitution, Mr #Trump does not have the authority to postpone the election himself. Any delay would have to be approved by Congress. The president does not have direct power over the two houses of Congress. #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Interesting scenario. “Even if Congress voted to delay the general election, the electoral college is still required to elect a president under federal law. If for some reason that didn’t happen, Trump and Vice President Pence would still be required to leave office by noon...
Um, no.  Trump just gave them a huge gift, which will increase their turnout and convince even more undecideds that this moron can't be POTUS for another four years.
Herman Cain, former presidential candidate and Trump surrogate, dies after battling coronavirus
Lol and the Obamas, Bushes, and Clintons can right but Trump can’t. You stick your head in a hole.
Sorry to Captain Obvious, but maybe attending that Tulsa Trump rally wasn't a good idea...
Lol blame Trump on everything. It’s okay the Democrats will lose again. Biden will lose a lot more than Hiliary. Democrat hates old white guy and they chose Biden that have been in politics for 50 years and all of a sudden he knows how to help Americans.....he was w/ Obama lol
Wow!  doing his part to keep America segregated! The Trump administration’s new housing rules will worsen segregation  #Segregation, alive and going strong in Trumps America! #BLM #DumpTrump2020
I oddly hadn't considered that the complete circle Venn diagram of Trump supporters and virus deniers would result in the Trump supporters dying from the virus that definitely doesn't exist. This is really working out. Something something birds:stones ratio.
2). Herman Cain died of COVID-19, which means that attending Trump's Tulsa rally almost certainly killed him. Literally.
CNN’s Don Lemon would tell you Herman Cain and 150,000 others died of the TRUMP VIRUS
Let's recap the day so far... 1). Trump wants to postpone the election.
Trump essentially killed him.
Opinion | Trump’s racist housing tweet is par for his family
I asked this question once before  but no one responded so I am asking again:  Regarding supporters of  who did they vote for prior to Trump's run for the presidency? Seriously, I am curious!! #ralpol #wakepol #ncpol
is not a true believer. Rip off that mask and fully embrace the Trump Death Cult. Sanity is for the weak!
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
This preacher at John Lewis’ funeral really just threw some underhanded insults at Trump about being divisive, then preceded to praise LBJ 🤦‍♂️  Great job liberal media 👍🏻
Yes, I'm angry but I'm not angry at Trump. He's been as advertised. I'm angry at you because I thought you knew better. I'm angry at myself because I thought I knew you better. I was wrong on both counts, and yeah that pisses me off.    #ThursdayThoughts
Eek. Your tribute turned ugly quickly.   Bill Clinton wore a mask and lives.  Everyone who anchors their lots to tRump usually just goes to jail.  Cain’s death is not only sad, it’s a warning.  #sad #historyisprophecy #riphermancain  #dontfollowhisexample
According to that piece of shit Nadler, they're protesters Trump is using for re-election ads ll
Today’s news:   -Herman Cain died from COVID-19. -President Trump suggested delaying the election. -New reports show a VERY shaky economy.  ... and it’s not even noon yet!
Your boys Trump and Pence said blacks are disproportionally impacted ????
Trump floats November election delay, but it won’t happen.
He contracted this shit at the Tulsa Trump rally.
Why is it with Herman Cain’s loyalty to Trump nobody prescribed him hydroxychloroquine ?? Think about it....
Is there anybody less American, less truthful, less moral than Trump. YES, THE ENTIRE #GOP THAT ENABLE HIM TO ACT THE WAY HE DOES, DESTROYING OUR ONCE GREAT USA. 😞
It. 👏 Is. 👏 Your. 👏 Narcissistic. 👏 Fault. 👏 Trump. 👏 Is. 👏 President. 👏
Hahahaha, purge the disbelievers! You must be fully committed to Trump's Death Cult!

Everything Trump touches dies.
trump goes in full-tyranny on same day our worst quarter financials EVER as a nation are announced
Don’t let Trump attempting to delay an election (the date is set by Congress not the president) distract you from the fact that the US just had it’s worst GDP fall in history, falling by 32.9%
Shouldn't even be talking about this. Should not give this a second's worth of thought. The real news is people are dying daily from an out of control virus, and our economy is wrecked. Fuck anything Trump says for the rest of his life.
Well, it looks like Trump's Tulsa rally literally killed Herman Cain.
He died because Trump went against the advice of public health experts and held a campaign rally in Tulsa.
Imagine helping your Enemies Destroy your own GDP and Military? #TreasonousTrump That's what Trump is Doing.
Thanks for proving trump right and the N&amp;O incorrect.
Thanks for proving trump right and the N&amp;O incorrect.
Millionaire businessman Herman Cain, who also ran for president, has died, age 74. He did not wear a mask when he attended a Trump rally in Oklahoma, hospitalized a month
I think it's more tragic because they fell into the fantasy that Trump has been spouting since it started. It ends up killing them (and potentially others) and it all could have been avoided.
Trump tweeting about a pizza place simultaneously with news breaking of Herman Cain’s death is another “the writers are getting lazy” moment.
It's sad that the most prominent victim of one of Trump's rallies would be an African American.  The former conservative party of the United States, the GOP, has lost its way and must be voted out en masse at the ballot box to make way for the sane conservatives again.
#GOPCorruptionOverCountry   Trump's greed and that of his family is costing lives.  Remember how his son in law put "volunteers" in charge of PPE?  How did that work out?  #PutinsPuppet  #GOPComplicitTraitors   #GOPDeathCult   #GOPTraitors
Unmarked contractors abducting citizens off the street? Trump suggesting fraud and a delay of the election? What the hell bizzaro world are we living in??? It sure as fuck doesn't look like America
Trump has exposed gaps in our government to manage and contain the powers of one person
You believe this about the NYT is false because Trump said so....got it. Have you ever actually read their articles? Properly sourced with links provided in-line with the text?
The trump kids are building motel 6 like hotels in the heartland now and the golf clubs are hemorrhaging money so Trump being in ads for local pizza spots and maybe a Kia dealership with employee pricing on Presidents Day is about as good as he’ll be able to do soon
This country has always been mad, Trump just uncovered the lunacy.
why are you using Trump as the harbinger of how to act as a person. this guy doesnt tell me what to do on my daily life, just the laws and taxes we follow
With Trump’s posse trying to suppress voting and his obvious attempts to slow down the USPS, this message is so important.  He wants teachers to risk lives but thinks polls are unsafe enough to suggest delaying the election? Vote early to remove this sociopath.
I don't understand this tweet. Is she expected to? Is Melania headlining fundraisers for Trump? Is Karen Pence?
When are we gonna stop asking and then  expecting the  to speak up against Trump. It’s never gonna happen. He clearly has a blank check to do and say whatever he wants at this point. Standby for the “oh he was just kidding” or “it was sarcasm” stock response
It's good to point out that Trump doesn't have the legal authority to delay the election, but that's not the same as him not trying.  Also worth attention today: a reminder that the administration response has helped drive the economy off a cliff:
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain. #ETTD #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

Cain attended Trump Tulsa rally maskless.
We are talking about Trump not the entire Republican party, but thats another conversation for a different day. So saying “Democrats” is not going to excuse Trumps crime.
I think Americans will go off the deep end if Goggles become mandatory like Fauci is now pushing.  Fauci needs to go.  I dont know why Trump is keeping him!
Narrator: Republicans are encouraging their voters to vote by mail. Czar Trump should spare us the bullshit
Herman Cain caught Covid at Trump’s Tulsa rally - at which supporters flouted not wearing masks, and the president went ahead despite warnings about contagion. How will his supporters, particularly African-Americans, take this news?
Staying in office after a defeat, or delaying the election? Those are hard. They require weeks and months of planning, convincing people to follow you, and putting your life on the line (especially with the latter). If it's hard, Trump's not going to do it.
trying to explain how and why trump sucks for a brand new reason every single day is a little exhausting
Czar Trump the troops weren't just to protect Germany. They have been there to prevent and or respond to Russian aggression. Did your KGB handlers not tell you that?
Record horrid GDP report, funeral of John Lewis with  giving eulogy. Trump tweets about delaying election as a distraction. Got it? States conduct elections. Only Congress can change the date set in Constitution. Don’t give him what he wants, please.
I’m sure there’ll be Discourse today about whether Trump is scheming election delays in earnest vs. as a distraction from today’s reports that his one bragging point, the economy, is a historic disaster. This is an easy one: it’s both.
Nope.  Why would he care?  Cain did what trump expects.  Blind, sacrificial loyalty
Trump Suggests Delay To November Election, But Congress Sets the Date
I hate how the news headlines have been "Trump proposes" or "Trump floats." He didn't do either of that! He just said some stuff. How many middle class tax cuts are there going to be before the media learns from this???
From the Tulsa rally. This is directly on Trump.
Family of murdered Fort Hood soldier Vanessa Guillen to meet President Trump today
That’s clearly not his voice it sounds like peter griffin trying to impersonate trump
What's been going on with Thom Tillis lately? #ncsen  Opposition to extending UI is "playing politics."  COVID plan was "too late" and simply "an act of self-preservation."  Polls show he "trails Cal Cunningham" and "is running far behind President Trump among likely GOP voters."
Seeing as how it appears Donald Trump has just killed Herman Cain by coronavirus I think things like this may take on a pretty litigious tone.
Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting… Not making America great again- see economy news today!!! So what does trump do? Deflect deflect deflect-jeez when will it end? #biden2020
[joker-and-here-we-go.gif]
Let’s roll with it. Trump supporters, we want to make sure you all get to vote. So we’ll be delaying Election Day for you guys only. You can vote in December.
It's funny how everyone that didn't vote for  knew he would tank as POTUS and look what we have here: Trump tanking as POTUS.  The MAGA pool is getting smaller and smaller everyday through CV deaths and awakenings. Trump is a fraud.
Trump only version of safe voting are votes for HIM.
Since 2015 many of us thought trump was setting up the US for canceling the 2020 elections.  Take his comments in toto about rigged elections, election fraud, him deserving more years as president (“many say it should happen”), and today’s tweet and voila, canceled elections
President Trump wants to delay the election until Joe can safely leave his basement
To those who do not support  President trump tell me why you don't support him and it cannot be in regards to anything the media has put out about him. Give me your own reasoning.
Biden in April: Trump will try and delay the election. GOP/Trump fans: Biden is being hysterical. Trump today: We should delay the election.
Without offering evidence to support his claim, Trump said mail-in voting will cause an “inaccurate and fraudulent” outcome.
I agree with and support your view here Congressman.  But let’s be real: Constitutional restraints haven’t held Trump back up to this point. Why should we expect him to respect the Constitution now?
AND TRUMP DISAGREED!!! No protesters were snatched up in unmarked cars
Trump got ratio'd and then pinned said tweet lol anyway sure hope I get to vote in November
One of the unintended benefits of the MSM fixation with Trump and COVID-19 has been a blessed lack of Sports, celebrity, and weather news. We even had a hurricane hit the gulf coast and no breathless CNN reporters in sight!
It would be nice if reporters who get the opportunity to ask Trump questions could remember to ask about things that have happened more than 24 hours ago.

Im sorry but Didn't Trump attack Iran without Congress?
They should not even be opened.  Omg we are being silently attacked from all sides while Trump rips off Taxpayers.
Trump will relentlessly make you look like an asshole no matter how improbable you think your defense could ever be held against you. Case in point
Well well well I guess we know what his next plan is don't we?  Buckle up America  Trump is really going to take over our Country.  Because You and I both know he isn't going to hand it over to  ?
Sooo you made this about Trump using a twitter-made MAGA acronym. WTF is TDS?

Just In: Trump tweets suggestion that election be delayed over concerns about mail-in voting
Trump can try to delay the election, but he's missing the larger point. His term ends on 1/20/2021 at noon if there's an election or not. Guess who else's term ends at that moment? Pence's.  That makes Pelosi — next in the line of succession — president until an election is held.
hey gun owners who claim they need 10+ guns in order to overthrow a tyrannical government, trump is pushing for the elections to be pushed back. wya?
Good thing congress is in charge of this: Trump suggests delaying the election, again attacks voting by mail
Predictable &amp; avoidable: we already have early voting, just expand/extend that option so we can wear masks &amp; space out 6+ ft, &amp; absentee ballots for those who still can't risk the line. BBC News: Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
Trump will say anything to distract from a pandemic that he managed terribly &amp; poor polling numbers. Trump does NOT have the authority to postpone Election Day.   👉🏽 Vote by Mail is safe &amp; secure  👉🏽 Election Day is November 3! 👉🏽 Make your voice heard!
The more I think about it, the more I'd love to see Kamala Harris as Attorney General rather than VP. It's not so much a demotion as a recognition that we need someone tough and unflappable to head up U.S. vs Donald J. Trump.
I'm not saying Trump would like to keep stormtroopers in major American cities that overwhelmingly vote for Democrats for the next several months until the election, but I'm not not saying that
Bill Barr is the most Corrupt AG in the History of America   He and Trump both should be locked up forever.
Also Trump will need to be asking Pelosi permission to do this since only Congress can change election day.  That should be fun.
So you’re for getting Trump out of Portland, even though he refuses to pull agents out
Absolutely.  And as long as there is a fair election and all votes are counted, Trump and his GOP enablers in the Senate will lose.
President Donald Trump proposed delaying the election in a tweet on Thursday, but only Congress has the authority to delay the election.

She is a problem for Trump they will kill her eventually. Putin will if necessary.
In 2016, I knew this man would never abdicate the throne.  I felt certain he would need to be forcibly removed.   He will.   Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Trump doesn't want to combat the virus.  It is what he will use to Weaken the US for Putin so Trump and his family can take over America.  This is big. And he needs to be stopped by our Military along with BARR.
WTF?!? I mean are we truly surprised? He was planning this for awhile now.
I’ll file this under “least surprising things Trump has tweeted”.
Trump's a traitor he has denied everything is a hoax. The Trumpvirus is hoax, The bounty on our service men &amp; women is a hoax. It's Not even worth him looking into it. He got to go!
Trump Sparks Firestorm With Suggestion To Delay Elections 'Until Vote Can Be Safe' | Zero Hedge
The economy is the only metric that middle-of-road voters trust Trump on more than Biden (probably because they only have a surface-level perception of his wealth). Losing the economy is losing the only legitimate card he has left to play.
More obvious by the day why he has turned the White House into a fortress. Starting to feel like a Trump administration coup will be fait accompli by Nov 3. Putin and Steve Bannon must be absolutely giddy.
Are you siding with Trump? You know the guy that says the virus will mysteriously disappear, but now is implying it will still be a major problem in November.
Someone's getting desperate. Trump is the great embarrassment to the USA.
Not only is Trump suggesting the election get postponed, but Attorney General Barr in front of Congress just the other day claims he has not looked into it. Want to bet Barr interprets the law the way Trump wants?
Trump floats election 'delay' amid claims of voting fraud ... Why am I not surprised? ... It's hard to focus on work with news like this ...
Hey look, Trump is a tyrant. What do Americans typically do with tyrants?
Regardless of the outcome of the election, you'll have made your bed with a predatory racist with contempt for Science, decency, and diversity—and I'll have made my stand for compassion, equity, and for the disparate people of this world. I've already won.
The first step toward a coup was when Sean Spicer told us that despite real evidence, Trump had the largest inaugural crowds ever, period. Every lie, crime, grift, broken norm, and lack of transparency that has been excused and covered up has inched us right up to the edge.
Wearing a white lab coat that anyone can buy online does not make one an expert, or even marginally competent in medicine, epidemiology or anything else.  Misinformation about effective Covid-19 protection measures is lethal.

FOH.  BBC News - Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
It's hard not to hate this guy. But I guess that's the point. #2020 #elections BBC News - Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election
Anyone that can’t put together that on the day that we reported the largest reduction in GDP ever Trump says we should “delay the election” is not paying enough attention.  Distraction is the only tactic Trump understands. Facts remain but he wants to be the carnival barker.
why is Trump allowed to post lies on Twitter constantly? Every day. He is trying to suppress the vote...please take action.
Well that certainly adds to the Trump legacy...
Here's the video of  telling me twice yesterday that Pres. Trump will accept the nomination in Charlotte on Monday of    He did NOT say he would give his speech in North Carolina (I never reported that).  The point is he said Trump will be in NC that week. #ncpol
The Trump Campaign will do everything in its power to steal the election. If this statement isn't considered a certainty, we're in serious trouble. Trump has never done anything that would indicate a different scenario for the next 100 days.
Originated in China but is THRIVING in Trump's America.
Trump will not win. Look at what he has done to this country. 75% of white males will vote for him but after that nothing
Donald Trump wants to delay the November election....No sir!
BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
Lol, no. The Left literally has delayed primarily elections this year due to COVID. But as soon as Trump says THE SAME THING....it’s an issue? Lol.
If you already know whom you plan to vote for, and given the effort Trump is expending to discredit (and possibly directly/indirectly hinder) mail-in voting, I would highly, highly recommend you go ahead and request and submit your mail-in ballot just as soon as possible.
Good news: Mars rover mission launched successfully  Bad news: Trump wasn't stuffed into the nose cone. I think he'd do really well on Mars.
If the Democrats insist on wide scale mail in voting then the election will be a joke. Trump said it perfectly .With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history.
Does this man ever sleep. Its too early for Trump BS
U.S. economy contracted at fastest quarterly rate on record from April to June as coronavirus walloped workers, bu… Yep.... we need to make America great again- but heck if it is trump gonna be the one to do it #biden2020
In consecutive days, Trump has touted a platform of segregation and threatened to delay the election that would remove him from office.
Everyone’s so insane and everything Trump says becomes such a hyper partisan issue, I can’t even find a straight answer on whether or not the stuff actually works.
I said this 3.5 years ago, and believed it every single day since. Trump's tweet to delay the election further cements it.
Worst US economic quarterly drop in history reported today.  Bets on number of Trump tweets today? Mine: 231
And to think some people see no connection between Trump and Putin at all....hmmmm.
Trump know we getting him tf out f here
Trump also "clearly has dementia", so those are our choices. I'll choose the man who has at least some intelligence left, and a good heart. #biden2020
Love it when trump gets the dem goat using satire... the crazy’s always come out and never disappoint.
The ads are bringing out the best of Trump supporters.
If you’re wondering whether Trump and Barr are going to accept defeat should he lose, read the last line of this tweet. The answer is undoubtedly no. We’ve underestimated Trumps willingness to shatter the law and norms. Don’t brush aside anything anymore.
The Trump administration announced that ICE won't allow new international students into the US if they are only taking online courses.   Without foreign students, NC schools will take a big financial hit.
Let's remember that Trump, GOP politicians, and MAGA voters have been complaining about/defying restrictions from Day 1, and despite the staggering loss of life, are sharing conspiracy videos and pushing kids back to school.  It's OK, they're "pro-life."
Mail-in voting and absentee voting are the same, but Trump can't oppose absentee voting because that's how he votes.
Trump’s desperately trying to devise a way to SLOW THE USPS &amp; ITS DELIVERY OF OUR MAIL-IN BALLOTS FOR THE 2020 ELECTION. Folks, we still have UPS! Maybe they can help us come up with a viable solution to getting our ballots to their respective location ON TIME! MUST EXPLORE!👍🇺🇸

The United States has the worst Trump Virus outbreak in the world and the POTUS is criticizing other countries.

OR who opened their big mouths in support of some of Trump's worst transgressions.
Trump is simply incapable of fulfilling the duties as head of state.
If you claimed to be embarrassed by Barack Obama but you're somehow not mortified by Trump—I'm going to suggest it was largely a pigmentation issue.  As an American committed to the diversity and equality at the heart of this nation—that embarrasses me.
Now we clearly see why Trump race baits. A good amount of his supporters feel this way. SAD.
Oh, racist slumlord acts to further discriminate housing throughout the land ...

Hey Trump said way long time ago that he'd run for president as a Republican because they are uninformed voters. That was before he ran for president
Morning knowledge bombs, in case you’re wondering “What’s the real data say on Trump’s fetish for HCQ (and killing America’s)?” No surprise - he’s wrong. Still a dangerous, anti-science moron who shouldn’t be president of a Waffle House booth, let along America.

This is why Trump has 60% disapproval.
Pence is a solid person to protest. At his core, he's even worse than Trump. At least Trump is incompetent. Pence is a career politician who is hyper religious and lets that influence his impact on this great country.

Vote early. “The surest way to prevent the vagaries of mail voting from distorting the outcome of the Presidential election would be for voters to deliver a landslide, so that disputed or rejected votes can’t change the result.”

Trump withdrawing American troops from Germany because they did not agree with adding Putin back into the G7! Deal worked out with Putin! Bet on it!
If anything, he gave him his 2 min of intelligence but he couldn’t make it work for. His arrogance &amp; stupidity surfaced like his devil’s horns. Trump is incompetent because he is the biggest fraud and liar in history. Daughter is no different. The family are incompetent clowns.
Mock video from the Republican National Committee (RNC Research). Really! No bias there.  If it is a problem, then what is Trump doing to address it?  His same response to COVID?  How well did that work out? 150,000 dead!

So know we know what Putin and Trump talked about a few days ago.
Trump supporters believing nonsense? No way! Tell us it ain’t so.  It’s not like they believe the garbage about immigrants being the root of our ills, or that we need a new military branch, the Space Force, to fight off aliens.  What? You mean... really... That’s deplorable!
Trump is not making anything great. Trump’s economic success is because of everything Obama abs Biden did in their term. Anyone and I mean anyone who would have taken office after them would have had the same success with the economy. It’s not trump’s doing. Wake up
- Joe, you'll find Trump's actions make perfect sense once you accept his one and only goal is to literally destroy this country. It's that simple. He's not playing 4-D chess, he's just an enemy of the state.
3. Conservatives like you supposedly hate Big Government, except somehow you're all in for Trump using federal law enforcement to attack and silence his/your political enemies. Hypocritical and anti-American.

So Trump should hand Putin a gift by pulling out troops as a result?  Okey dokey, then.
It is founded on the principle of stealing. Zuckerberg stole the Facebook platform from a "friend." He has no values, morals, and ethical northstar. It is not surprising that Mark gets along with Trump so well. They are two peas in a pod.
It really doesn’t take longer than two seconds for somebody to make Trump look an ass focusing on...saving Suburban neighborhoods by wanting to keep out low-income homes. HPU is a private school. This guy wasn’t from a low-income family....and was about to light that place up.
I am very concerned about NC. Republicans have already messed with mail-in ballots by harvesting them, filling them out for their own candidate, or throwing them away. Now add Trump's new crony at USPS, and all bets are off. Vote very early by mail or in person if you can.
No....she just wants to pass another massive stimulus’s in a month she can turn around and talk about how much the national deficit has geown under Trump.  This woman is evil personified

Odd that these aren't the types of discussions we're having. Both Trump and Biden have grounds which they could (and should) be immediately impeached over. This election is beyond in peril.
Bwaahahahhaaa hahahahaha [breathe] Bwaahahaha hahahaha hahahaha. [breathe] bwahahahaha ahhahahaa. That is the funniest thing I’ve read today. Lady, we don’t need the media to tell us Trump is a white suppremacist racist piece of shit. He does that just fine all on his own. 😂🤦🏼‍♀️

Agreed. And Trump isn't even a real conservative.
Does anyone actually believe that Trump and the GOP will not try to steal this election away from the Democrats? They are committing crimes in the light of day. Watch the mail slow way down and votes not make it in time. We must do something to prevent what will happen!
When is enough enough?  Trump's announcement to pull troops from Germany was a surprise to:  people in the White House; the military; the Pentagon; the Intelligence community.  It's like the alarms are going off and no one is coming to the rescue.

I wish someone in the House would wake up and do something about Mr Trump. He is doing nothing about the COVID-19 and we are literally dieing out here. Please, Trump has literally gone nuts.
How could you not know? Look at the terror - tangible, physical harm - Trump causes every day. Trump disrespects scientists and experts and is trying to kick 25 million people off their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. I'd trade this idiot for someone creepy any day.Remember, what Trump says doesn't matter, because he's speaking out of dementia and he's constantly lying. It's whether Barr and others will try to make his lies come true that is the concern. I think Trump's words here are just his usual meaningless word salad.
The governor can call up the Guard if she wants. I don't know how bad that would be politically, or democratically, to do that. But I'd sure love to see it.  I don't think there's any way Trump can take control of her Guard. He really doesn't understand this stuff.
Isn’t it? I just couldn’t bear it - couldn’t break the spell I was under after absorbing every word President Obama spoke. I turned Trump off after just one word.

Seems that many did not see or pay much attention. I read last month that McConnell told GOP if Trump did not change message by Labor Day they could basically do what they had to do to save their seat.  It was reported McConnell leaked this.
Trump is talking out his ass. The Guard has already stated, and proved, that they will NOT take action against protesters. They have none of the leeway the  has, they can't and won't do anything close to what Trump would want. The Guard thing is just more Trump ignorance.
I've often thought of this; Dems were all about Trump not accepting the outcome.   I hope the return of this issue is not a bad omen.
Many working class Americans , particularly those in the construction industry , feel betrayed by Trump . Wages remain depressed , and illegals remain on most every job site.
Let it be known... we warned you. We knew this was going to get dangerous, and it did.
I’m glad we copied Trump as well...as if he actually reads anything that isn’t written with a sharpie...sorry John last thing twitter needs is more politics....
"May Send National Guard to Oregon." Ok, I literally LOL'd at that. Trump has NO IDEA how the military works.  How do you "send in" a force that is already stationed there? Is he "sending in" other states' Guards? That would make NO sense, and NO states would do that. 1/
Look at 2016 my man. The average of polls was off by 1.2 points from the final result. If that were the case today, Biden would win the popular vote by 7.1 points. No way Trump eeks out an electoral college win with that margin.
The first I heard about goggles was a liberal reporter asking Fauci about goggles and Fauci said not a bad idea...then it turns into “Fauci says everyone should wear goggles.” Liberal reporters trying to influence medical decisions to make people more miserable to hurt Trump.
Trump simply could not tolerate another day of the nation focused on someone other than him (a black man!).    So, with one tweet, we're  talking about him again.  Mission accomplished.

I can’t stand Hollywood.  I just finished the Epstein doc on Netflix.  It TRIED to tie Trump to Epstein (failing miserably), and did not include a SINGLE GD interview or mention of the accuser who says Epstein &amp; Maxwell sold her to John McCain and Joe Biden through a DC madam...
Trump tweeting about Herman Cain's death
So, like Trump. Got it. 😂
Donald Trump?
Trump just could not stand another day of the nation talking about John Lewis -- and just like that, with one tweet, the nation is, once again, talking about Trump.
Whose fault was it that the stockpile was depleted after 3 years of Trump? His party had control of both houses until 2018. We sent supplies to China in January, we didnt order extra or build out our capabilities. Still havent used DPA for masks. Abject failure.
Look around the world. Nobody is doing worse than us right now. Economically, death toll, number of cases, pretty much any measure you choose. Bush stopped SARS, Obama stopped Ebola. Trump failed, no way around it.
Trump has turned us into a Socialist country. Farmers and businesses were being given payments well before covid due to the trade war. Stimulus payouts, fixed drug pricing. We look more like Venezuela now that we ever have.
Why Aunty Em would vote for Trump.... (1/2500)
Like I said. Keep believing Biden's 8-point lead isn't real. You probably don't even need to vote since Trump will win so easily.
Since Trump thinks it'll be too unsafe in November, Chris Cuomo suggests we vote right away!   Let's say next Tuesday, everybody gets the day off, and we'll even call it #TrumpDay.   I am so there.

How Donald Trump Shifted Kids-Cancer Charity Money Into His Business
Trump, McConnell and the really stupid guy at our marina.
I don't know if I'd say Kansas is the tipping point for control of the Senate. More likely it comes down to two of these three states: Iowa, North Carolina, and Maine.
Oh god y’all have no idea.  Fake new and fake polls.  All leftist propaganda.  Democrats have completely shown their ass the last 3.5 years.  Half my Democrat friends voting Trump secretly.  Like I said, get your popcorn ready Nov. 3rd.  Gonna be a LONG night for you.
Trump calls it winning.
Wait, you think if Trump was ahead in the polls then he might NOT float the idea of delaying the election? Weird....
Jared Kushner’s coronavirus task force decided to ignore a nationwide effort because only blue states had the virus - Apparently there is no bottom to how evil the Trump crime family can be! #TrumpCrimeFamily #JaredGoringKushner
It's at once reassuring and terrifying that Trump is following a well-worn playbook.  Reassuring because we know what's coming. Terrifying because so many have gotten away with it.  #Election2020
Flash forward 10 years from now and replace Bush with Trump. It’ll be no different.
Trump doesn't want to control healthcare, that's your party. "You'll be able to keep your doctor" (lie) remember?

Army Ranger and lifelong Republican tells you why he's not voting for Trump
Bingo!!  Now the Marxist Dems can't move the goal posts because of COVID-19 or some other Voter issue, Nov 3rd. Trump is an effective chess player!  He Trumped them again.
Wah wah wah, let's all blame Trump
With Trump donor in charge, Postal Service may shut locations and cut service before Election Day
I was just wondering why this was the one thing that's making GOP speak up against Trump. Now I understand - sounds like it would almost certainly benefit Dems. Silly me for thinking, "Do Republicans actually care sometimes about the Constitution?" Nope.
No doubt Trump talks to Vlad more than he does to his campaign manager
Demcast Joins “Protect the Results” Coalition To Mobilize Americans If Trump Refuses To Concede  #DemCast #Focus14
I read a month or so ago that if Trump didn't get on message by Labor Day  McConnell was giving the okay for GOP to move away from him. Reported that he leaked this info.
And the Media instantly fell for it; how they love every glittering shiny little object Trump tosses their way.
So if my family believes in racism, you know they support Trump. And the elimination of this rule is reprehensible. Just like Trump. When people show you who they are, believe them. Trump is who he has shown us: ignorant, racist, traitor, criminal, amoral, and unrepentant.
Trump.
So trump deadass trynna move the Election Day
Is your life goal really to be a couch potato who does nothing but defend trump all day
FUCK TRUMP.   That is all.
People really wana act like everything prior to 2016 was perfect &amp; Trump turned back the clock to the 1800s during his tenure.
I used to wish that Trump would die - like every day.    Now I hope he lives a long life - in prison, humiliated, on constant suicide watch so he has to stay alive in his misery for many years.   #WorstPersonEver #TrumpSux
She and I were VASTLY outnumbered by our white family members voting for Trump. We’re both white. Yep. Most of the white people I know voted Trump.

I’m starting to think Washington and big tech have secretly discovered that Hydroxychloroquine is actually the cure for Trump Derangement Syndrome and once you take it you automatically become a Trump supporter and immune to mind control

This man is absolutely everything our country was founded against. #AnyoneButTrump2020
Harwood makes a point of mentioning that Cain attended Trump’s Tulsa rally.  Harwood is a liberal partisan hack.
So you agree then? Trump supporters are trash.
Republicans politicized COVID? 😂 I’m sorry, who started an all out smear campaign on a generic drug (that’s safer than aspirin!) all because Trump said it was showing positive results?!
You mean like those Trump supporters when he supports China re-education “factories”?
It's all up to us if we want to allow Trump to "cancel" or "postpone" the election, or let him try to contest the results. When Biden wins an overwhelming victory on election night, which will be held on Tuesday, November 3rd, and then he will be inaugurated in January, period.

Where was Trump today for John Lewis funereal? The last three presidents were there.  I never thought I would say this I miss Bush as President and when he was in office he said that a big virus would be here one day

You want to provide liabilty protection to employers.  Meaning you can get hurt or killed due to your employer’s negligence and have no recourse.  Take heed, trump supporters.  Don’t be a Herman Cain.  #RIPHermanCain
We all wish, Trump needs to resign. Walk away before it's too late.
Here is what you should take away: Trump doesn’t have the authority to postpone the election. And thank goodness. Because our economy can’t handle another four years of diversions &amp; broken promises.
Here are the facts:  👉🏽 Voting by mail is safe and secure. 👉🏽 There IS a “process” in place to vote by mail.  👉🏽 Trump votes by mail.  👉🏽 Republicans are encouraging other Republicans to vote by mail.
Kentucky is really red but it only went for Trump by 30 points. In contrast, Hillary Clinton won Minnesota's 5th District by 55 points.

Funny how none of the GOP started speaking out against Trump until the primaries were over 🤔
Disgusting, sociopathic, but not surprising. Kushner should be put on trial for deliberately scuttling testing plans on the grounds that the virus, by having a greater impact on blue states, would be politically advantageous to republicans and Trump. #onev1
It's especially fun when Trump supporters rush to say Trump was joking and then a day later Trump says he wasn't joking.
So did Trump folks kill Herman Cain to rally around China Virus???
Did you really just sit there and let Trump politicize the man death who you was so livid over earlier ????
When are you going to hold the Trump administration accountable?
Makes me realize you blindly follow trump and don't listen to the lies, nonsense, and utter insanity he says.
No worries. Trump’s just throwing around Twitter excrement in order to distract from:  RECORD NEGATIVE 32 PERCENT 2nd Quarter GDP.  1.4 MILLION NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS  And Trump backing the “DEMON DOCTOR” in his last Press Conference where he beat another hasty exit.
Thank you. #Trump #MadeAmericaTrash

You sound angry. Reagan said we have opponents not enemies. Trump has betrayed the Republican Party. He and his enablers must be purged. Get out of the way.

Steven Calabresi will vote for Donald Trump in November. He will release a statement regarding some innocuous, dem boiler plate thing Biden says as a reason , that despite Trumps personal abhorrence, the radical agenda of Biden is just too dangerous for the nation to endure.

We need an Independent counsel or panel to investigate this disaster after Trump is out of office.
You are an embarrassment to all Americans who died to defeat Hitler and his accolade tRump.
Y’all, when THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY calls for the impeachment of Trump based upon his election postponement ideas, that’s pretty watershed.  I know we keep thinking and hoping each thing will be enough to stop him and it’s not, but the fact the right of the right are done is shock

Trump votes by mail you colossal tool.   There's no cases of widespread vote by mail fraud. And the most recent cases have been by Republicans and caught and corrected.
All things that have NEVER happened and are created by the liar-in-chief.  He creates more boogeymen than Stephen King.  Protect it from any fraud, like any election, and don’t act like trump is above cheating.
Yes, but senator, patriots need to know that you’re 100% behind Trump. A lot of them were pissed off when you voted against the wall. Own up to that and you will win in a landslide

There's a lot to unwind. I suspect Biden will do it quickly and have a transition team in place unlike Trump in 16.  It's hard to fathom how much damage they *didn't* cause due to their ineptitude.

Because the House Bill left out of its bill fuller tax deductions for Business Meals (like those at Trump Hotel Restaurant) or omitted renovation money to keep FBI where it is now located so a hotel that will compete w/Trump’s can’t be build? We are not stupid.

USPS has a board of governors. Supposed to be 9, down to 6, 4 were appointed by Trump. They then voted for Trump's Postmaster pick, DeJoy.  Senate, controlled by GOP, confirmed all.

There will be no military coup in support of Trump. The Pentagon has already defied him several times and he isn't nearly as popular w/ the military as ppl think.  This is why he's using  instead. But the DOD will stomp them if they try to keep Trump in office illegally.
So much for the Supreme Court decision in Nevada recently.  Why have a standard when a double Democrat standard will do.  Great country!  Dual system of Justice. Republicans are weak and feckless, not willing to make a stand. Trump is by himself, the rest hide.
Trump appointed a Postmaster who, arguably, is there to undermine it. He has ordered carriers to delay mail delivery and pick-up. This will threaten counting of votes cast by mail in states with election day deadlines for their receipt, not postmarked.
Honestly, in regards to Cain and the 150,000 that have died unnecessarily due to trumps negligence, trump should be charged with manslaughter!

One thing that's cool about this election is you can safely disregard every opinion of anyone that ever claimed they were for "small government" and then votes for Trump even after he sent federal storm troopers into states to assault people against that states governments wishes
Worth watching.  Bottom line: * If HCQ + Zinc doesn’t work, it is relatively safe, cheap, and does little harm.  * If HCQ + Zinc does work, CNN and their media allies have killed THOUSANDS of Americans in order to make Trump look bad.
It's also a signal that Trump isn't getting support from his party for an effort to contest the election results. Even GOP members of Congress are ready to see Trump gone.

A steady ally of President Trump, Herman Cain was seen at times w/o a mask on at Trump's Tulsa, OK rally in June, tested positive for the virus on June 29, and went to the hospital two days later.
Is this what Trump discussed with Putin instead of bounties placed on US   TROOPS this is Russian foreign policy being conducted from the White House. Putin must be so proud. How does this help the USA?
Don't you get tired of carrying trump's water? Let's remember the facts.   Flynn pled guilty multiple times Flynn pled guilty as part of a deal to not be charged with more serious crimes.   If his prosecution is dropped, he and his son can be charged for the more serious offenses
Choked back tears the entire time President Obama spoke. His voice and his genuine grief and belief in our wrestling back our Democracy through the power of good trouble and VOTING gave me hope. People this good have to win/triumph over Trump’s evil.
It would have been a speech about Trump.
Obama better at spying on Candidate Trump, drone bombing weddings and funerals, partying with his Celeb friends, and did nothing for poor Americans and Black Americans in 8 years.
Except that Trump has only escalated the drone strikes that Obama had. And then stopped reporting them because it would make him look bad

Is is not equally as possible that the coronavirus is a major threat to public health, and that it's being downplayed to affect the presidential election, to save the economy at the expense of public health, to save Trump's image? Certainly if one is possible, so is the other.
Start pushing on Joe Biden to sit for ONE interview and ask real questions. Amazing the democratic nominee gets a free pass from the media. Even  Chris Wallace asked trump hard questions, joes turn
Hating on Republicans and Trump is cheap, low-hanging fruit &amp; honestly boring. Negativity against humans in either direction doesn’t win over new supporters. Critiquing the current system with smart, insightful takes about how we can improve things for normal people is best imho
It's quite amazing. I don't think you can take away Trump's phone.

For the president, everything is politics. Trump is and he’s always been jealous of Obama and this is just another jealous response to Obama getting more positive attention then him. But why didn’t he volunteer to give a eulogy???
Here's the real reason Donald Trump is afraid of vote by mail. In North Carolina, recent bipartisan elections reforms make it easier to vote by mail. It's also led to a surge of Democrats requesting vote by mail ballots. NO delay. #ncpol

STOP falling for Trump Distractions. The more outrageous his tweet or a spokesman's sound bite the more you should halt and and ponder what is going on right now that he wishes to get drowned out and lost in his noise. Remember Master Putin is Trump’s true campaign manager.
Oh, CNN, how soon you forget... In a story posted on July 30 about Trump's suggestion that the 2020 election be postponed due to the pandemic, your story stated emphatically that there was no evidence that voting by mail leads to voter fraud. But, wait, …

True. It’s real. I’ve seen victims of it. People with no underlaying cases who suffers terribly because of it. But MSM media is responsible for arming the pandemic to discredit Trump and blowing it out of the proportion.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Hahaha It’s overall trust buddy. Has not a damn thing to do with Trump
I'd like to get this topic polled. In the event Trump's tweet is included in the question, how many Republicans do you think would agree? I'm going with at least a plurality.
Well, Seeing that Trump himself has been pushing its development, I’m sure I would get one in the future.   But again, it would depend on where it come from; I would be wary if it comes from Bill Gates or China.

#ObamaWasBetterAtEverything  Yep, not even a question.  Obama eclipses Trump in every single way....and knowing how true that is drives Trump insane....especially since (God forbid), Obama is a (gasp) Black man.  Trump is a child, and a deeply insecure one at that.
Trump is INSANE INCOMPETENT &amp; IDIOTIC!

Trump shatters his own show of responsibility on the pandemic - CNNPolitics
I'm sure Herman Cain signed the waiver agreeing not to hold the Trump campaign liable should he get sick and/or die from Covid19 after attending the rally like everyone else who attended.  Which makes Trump responsible and totally off the hook at the same time.
sounds familiar. Many libs said similar stuff when Clinton was “100% gonna win” then turned around and cried manipulation for years- to the point of impeachment. In the slim chance Trump wins, watch Biden supporters cry voter suppression / ballot manipulation.
Listening to Trump in this news conference and I feel like I have either gone insane or it’s just parody.
The simplistic thinking is on your side, dear, and your fearless old model  leader, Trump.  He has brainwashed you, sadly.
He passed away from Trump’s negligence.
You mean you don’t know? Really!  Because President Trump is not in the club - he is not part of the establishment of corruption and he puts American citizens and the country first.  He doesn’t take a salary.  He calls B.S, and they hate him for it.

Of course mortalities lag, no one is disputing that. I merely gave you the facts on mortality rates based off the numbers we have right now today. I realize that it doesn't fit the narrative that you want to project about President Trump, sometimes facts get in the way.

This is a hoax.  Even Trump is not that stupid.
The NCGOP sent out an absentee mailer WITH a Trump tweet on it.  We heard from republican voters who thought it was fraudulent:
Conversely, now the Democrats will insist on a timely election because Trump opposes it.   Biden officially is nominated.  Trump shows Biden to being incapable of running the country.  The Democrats can not postpone the election to get a lucid candidate.  Trump wins.

Nope. You made mine. I have asked for you to show proof of trump not being a racist and all you can do is post a pic that has been proven to be a lie. Is that what you like to promote? Lies and propaganda is all you have. We all know the truth. Trump is a huge racist period
Cool.... Hier Trump is afraid that people will still vote his ass out. If not we will still remove him FR style.
He would be a HUGE upgrade to someone who had to ask a doctor on NATIONAL TV if ok to inject disinfectant into our bodies!!  You cannot compare the mental capacity of the two. Trump is just plain dumb &amp; has no excuse. Biden was born with a speech impairment &amp; had his entire life.

Why are Hearing members playing AG Barr’s game. This hearing was called to investigate Barr’s interference with the Justice Dept. on every case involving Traitor Trump and his cronies. Instead it’s becoming a hearing about the protest. And police brutality. Get back to the basics
From cited article: “President Donald Trump says he’s willing to help blue-state governors who are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks — but only if they’re willing to stop criticizing him in exchange.”
But they will because it's their answer for everything..Trump. Has nothing to do with the mayors and governors making excuses for the criminals, allowing them to do as they please. Or the rioters themselves that are so angry with their lives they feel the need to break and burn.
But hey, they really want hedgefunders to be able to deduct 100 percent of their boondoggle dinners. What a complete joke. And to protect the Trump Hotel by spending 1.8 billion on the  building. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

Yea dude whatever you say. Ignore data or research and just assume the truth is whatever you think it must be. Im sure you are one that thinks it's all Trump's fault anyways so what difference does it make? Peace
GD how did people become so naive? Everything is Trump's fault right? The guy that's been in politics for 3 1/2 years vs Biden, Pelosi, Schumer..that's been running states and cities into the ground for decades.Yea just one block and a few bad apples ruining "peaceful protests".
And if trump somehow got behind it and got it passed before November he would win lol
Trump, truly, is NO President. He is a Hideous Lowlife. He must be driven out of the White House..........
A "Holding my nose and voting for Biden" vote has no more value than an "I LOVE TRUMP" vote.  A vote is a vote. The level of enthusiasm in casting it has no bearing on the outcome.
A Tremendously Successful Disaster
Y’all ‘member that time Trump defrauded a charity to fund his campaign, law suit settlements and a 10k painting for one of his properties? I ‘member.
Trump (and the people he listens to) has to have money invested I whoever is making the stuff.

My 24 year old nephew is very political. He marches in BLM protests, posts “defund police” messages, etc. and holds a grudge against Biden. He hates trump, thankfully. He doesn’t like his choices. I think we can count on him to begrudgenly vote Biden.
This will create more Trump's in the future. The tighter the social media companies control the flow, the louder the opposition has to be to get through.   Biden can be soft-spoken as he has their approval. Trump has to scream from the rooftops to get through.
tRump will not stop his Disinformation Campaign for anyone. He, and the Russians, are just getting started. Next installment. Barr’s Congressional testimony.
Trump retweet?  Because it’s his kind of tough. Guys with stupid hairdos, beating up gals.TRANSLATION: "black people will forever be poor and live in low income housing".. y'all really don't understand how racist y'all sound try to stick racism on trump lol
Yet still isn’t sure whether he’ll vote for Trump.
If they can all attend a funeral and not 6 ft apart Trump can have a rally and we can go vote in November.
Basement boy   Always complaining about Trump tweeting. Yet you are always at top of my feed with some cheesy message you didn’t write.
Will trump attend his loyal supporter funeral?
They'll have to ask Trump first to see if they're allowed to change their views.  Susan Collins may be slightly dismayed.

#RacistInChief is an accurate description of the #RacistInChief of the talking Cheeto. However, should #RacistInChief be trending because Trump is actually the most moronic #RacistInChief on the planet. Let's not hurt the #RacistInChief feelings by calling him what he is.
If a Democrat runs it,  chances are it’s a shit hole right now.   Wonder why ?   And they blame Trump   We know better,    Good luck corn pop
We're open today until 5!  We have Trump signs and many other candidate signs and information.  Come by and see us!
Why do you keep lying? America does not like Fauci more than Trump! 🙄🤣🤣🤣
I’m going down swinging to these punk police and feds if I’m peacefully protesting...sorry not sorry. This is kidnapping! But go ahead and praise Trump and Barr🎃🤡 #AmericanGestapo #AmericaOrTrump
Wrong again. Trump signed a bill in December that guarantees 250 million to HBCU’s for the next 5 years among other bills for minorities. Research it
Folks will not be voting for you due to your policies. It will be that Trump is bad man.  Bad because he puts America 1st
So is Trump the only person that retweeted this, or just the only one you are pointing out?

Absentee ballot, legal voters have that option.  Debate Trump you chicken..
Trump Virus? That is so dump, how are you in office?
It will be just as bad with Joe Biden as President!!!  Donald J Trump is the man our country needs!!! #fourmoreyears  #wethepeople #americanpatriots  🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
We have Trump signs!!  They are $10 each.  We are open today 1 to 5pm, tomorrow 2-4pm and then 6-9pm.  Open Friday 1 to 5pm.  Also signs for Dan Forest, Sammy Webb, E.C. Sykes and Mick Rankin.We can wait until ~after~ November 3 to let them know we don’t buy their act. Let them drown Trump, then we’ll drown them.
“...he was hospitalised less than two weeks after attending the US president’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on 20 June.   Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was photographed at the event without a face mask and not physically distancing..”
I am less a fence-sitter than a strategic player. Let them distance themselves from Trump. Win landslides in November. Take huge margins in both houses of Congress, and the Presidency, and as many statehouses as possible. THEN make them all pay.
Obviously, include: - J Kushner - McConnell - Flynn - Bannon - A Jones - Sekulow - Giuliani - Mulvaney - Manafort - DeVos - The GOP Senators who acquitted Trump - All the people who refused to testify in the Mueller investigation and the impeachment hearings. - Scott Pruitt
This strikes me as a very serious misunderstanding of scale.   Trump is directly responsible for more American deaths than any war but the Civil War and WWII.   His goons are kidnapping people in unmarked vans, without badges.   He’s talking of postponing the election.
So can we also sue trump and his feeble enablers like you Senator Tongue-Tied? It’s the Trump Virus and both of you will pay for your criminal malfeasance come November.
A Trump.
You better read this pre-COVID (Feb ‘20) piece in Forbes. You got it ALL wrong, honey. In fact, Trump was running the economy in the ground.
Trump is trying to make voting illegal 😳🚫🍊🤡
I want to believe that Pompeo has no political power once Trump is gone. (He knew not to run for Senate in Kansas, although I wish he had if only to see him suffer a humiliating loss).
The Trump Magat Regime, enabled by the GOP, is a hate group.
Trump has made it clear (over and over) that he not the President of all Americans.
It's trump speak for none of this is true
Not Trump era, but I still want to know if  won the Senate election at the end of Season 2 of
It would also apply to nominations. This is a way to invigorate the majority, but force it to concentrate its attention on the most pressing issues while still giving the minority a voice. For example, would probably force Trump to either sign or veto a minimum wage increase now.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.
Trump doesn’t believe in Intelligence 🤔🤓😳
"Trump probably cannot postpone the election, the bedrock of American democracy, but the greater danger is that he can destroy its legitimacy," writes
I didn't even mention Herman Cain dead from COVID after not wearing a mask to a Trump Rally...
It's not a challenge for Biden.  It's a challenge to all of us to get ourselves to the polls and remove all doubt that Trump has lost by a huge margin.
Trump campaign halts ad spending as president prepares to resign.
Please. Save us the indignation and crocodile tears. You have supported Trump through each and every screw up and now all you are doing is covering for your previous position that he wouldn’t postpone the election. You got caught with your pants down. Admit it
Yes, Trump's doing a great job campaigning for Biden by simply being incompetent.
lmaoo so just say you’re okay with how the world is and what trump is doing and keep it pushing. this election is about choosing the better of the two evils, and you not voting at all (giving trump another vote) is high key ignorant.
Meanwhile, in other news: 1. Trump attacks vote by mail 2. Trump wants to cancel the election  3. Pompeo says Bill Barr can decide to cancel the election 4. The United states still has approx 1/4 of the world's cases of COVID 5. We learned the US GDP PLUMMETED by 32%
I was just talking about this with a friend. I’m wondering why Trump has 5-6 “friends” who died of cv if HCQ is the cure. Maybe they weren’t friends? Driving me crazy, can’t believe anything or anyone. Ugh.
“Social activism is driving the anti-trump narrative in an inprecedented way. It is now a findamental part of a presidential campaign!”  Mike Madrid,  Town Hall, just now
It's impossible that Pence wouldn't go down for or be in the know about the laundry list of things Donald Trump's adminstration is doing
To all trump supporters : #covid19 is a GLOBAL #PANDEMIC IT IS  NOT a made out pandemic by the libs as U naive guys think, I feel sorry 4 how #trump is using UR innocent minds 2 instigate his hate only 2 benefit himself. btw his 2 wives R immigrants and his kids are anchor kids.
It’s infuriating. Another reason to hate Trump; he’s so openly awful that he made everyone get soft on Dubya.
It can all be avoided by re-electing Trump and taking back the House.
Shamelessly divisive and partisan. On the quote mentioned above: it’s sententious, maudlin demagoguery. This guy is why Trump is in office.
Translation: We know we can't win with Trump but if we can get rid of him, maybe we can get Pence elected.
I defy you to find one reasonably intelligent parent that is going to throw their children into a covid invested school. Donald Trump is dangerous for our health, wealth, the lives of our parents and the lives of our children. He's murdered a hundred and fifty thousand Americans.
This tweet is factually incorrect on many levels. 1) Orin Kerr didn’t write the op ed; Steven Calabresi did (the tweet says “Steven Calabresi” 2) Orin is not the “co-chair” of the Federalist Society, a position that I don’t believe exists 3) Kerr is an outspoken Trump critic
every neolib political Twitter account today regarding whatever trump did
With Trump's "just asking???" tweet this morning, together with all the times he's "joked" about it before, we can see the coming battle for a peaceful, fair election.
And this is what they are trying to prevent:
I literally saw a couple in the grocery store the other day wearing this on their heads, *over* normal surgical masks. I would've laughed, but I was afraid I might start crying.
Money Laundering has always been one of Trump's only skills.
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
So now that Mr. Cain died of #CoVid, Mr. Trump proposed delaying Nov. #elections, the top largest school districts in the US + 1/3 of NC boards of ed. chose to go with remote learning for safety, can  call it for Plan C to keep NC safe? Asking for all of my friends.
Masterful usage of language and double entendres in this article! (And, not just talking about “impotent,” many more witty, subtle call outs of his core.
I had to listen to the deranged ramblings of a maniac to be sure, the first time I heard it it seemed unbelievable.  Yes, Trump wants to delay the general election.  And his asskisser at State says Bill Barr is the one who should decide???  What the actual F...?
I think there’s even odds he quits if he loses badly enough. Trump is not a fighter. He’s walked away from everything that ever got hard. I can see his ego getting wounded enough that he just leaves the WH and holes up in Mar-a-Lago for the lame duck session.
Trump says he was joking about postponing election in 5, 4, 3, 2..
I'm astounded what you've done to your legacy. It's deplorable  and pathetic. You had done such wonderful things as a federal prosecutor for the southern district of New York. But you pissed it all away by hitching your wagon to tRump. I don't get it.
Yeah, I’m sure trump supporters when asked by pollsters are saying they don’t approve of trump and will vote for Biden instead.
Throwback to yesterday when not a single guest on NPR's  would say Trump was a fascist.
Since Biden has nixed including Marijuana legalization in the Democrats' platform, Trump should come out in favor and offer to reschedule it if re-elected. Would blow peoples' minds.
NEW: Founder of conservative organization the Federalist Society says Trump’s tweet seeking to postpone the election is “fascistic and itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.” Wow.
We're focused on the epic fuck up, disaster and shitshow that is the tRump presidency. Hunter Biden doesn't hold a candle to the hundred and fifty thousand people your father has murdered and the economy he's destroyed. Thank you pro-choice poster child. #COVID19 #prochoice
In honor of John Lewis, let's make Donald Trump the LAST racist president.
Interesting. I wonder whether it is because folks on the left rang the “delay the election” alarm bell before Trump actually said it—then folks on the right were able to say that was clear evidence of Trump Derangement Syndrome because Trump’d never do/say something so awful...
Not a chance. Trump HATES that his poll numbers are so bad and his approval rating is so low. There’s no way there would ever be an initiative to poll for Biden when they’re trump supporters.
Are you suggesting that the so called “silent majority” when polled, say they’ll vote for Biden or that they don’t approve of trump?
That’s why Trump wants it. Check and see if he or family are tied in with stocks.
Will Trump supporters actually donate plasma?
Traitor Trump got it wrong!  Dead wrong!  Dead to the tune of more than 120,000 unnecessary deaths.  The Obama administration left a detailed playbook on the epidemic which was discarded.  This lack of action has led to tens of thousands of needless deaths...and counting!
Thecwsllbisvusekess. No one wants to come here right now because our country is overrun with a virus that trump failed to deal with.
Donald Trump is attempting to destroy democracy in this country and declare himself king. #FakePresident
Wow!  It’s not every day that our president utters a non-false statement.    Out of 821 statements checked by  this is Trump Truth Number … 35!   source:

16 years of Trump in the White House is a beautiful thing. 8 as Potus 8 as Juniors VP.
She saying to trump👉🏽 I’m going to slap you then take it back but slap you again!!  This women needs help, she is so 😐
I suppose the liberals want the building of a new FBI headquarters...which will help one of Trump's businesses or perhaps they really wanted the $1,000,000,000 funding for fighter jets and another $1,000,000,000 for other military aircraft.  Blame this on the liberals!!

Best way to see a Trump tweet: with strikethrough all over it.
Congratulations to      another record set by the trump organization.   The LARGEST economic quarterly plunge since records have been keep after WWII!  GREAT JOB..IGNORANCE, INCOMPETENCE CONTINUES!
Oh, so Schumer objected to the republican bill including 1.75 Billion for a new FBI building next to a trump property? THAT the “left-wing policy” that has you so whiny Tongue-Tied Tillis? How those “rightwing policies” working out for the country? 155,000 deaths. GDP lowest EVER
There goes 10% of Trump's black support. Hopefully the other nine folks will wear masks, observe social distancing, and wash their hands regularly.

They made them trade in their confederate flags in for trump flags 🤦🏾‍♂️
You can't claim he didn't know. We knew. I guess Democrats thought "it can't happen here." And we're supposed to trust those same fools now.
Was Trump there? Did he speak?
I see 5 people wearing masks. You know if they get sick and die, they won’t vote for trump?
Can't wait to reference this article in a couple of months when the GOP lines up behind Trump to kiss his ass.
Wow.  "Bureau employees grew so concerned...they secreted at least 3 copies of key documents, including Comey's memos, in remote locations around the Bureau" to ensure "the documents could always be preserved, located, &amp; shared."
And that it's quite likely that he contracted it at a Trump rally.
Now things get really dangerous with Trump. He's starting to panic, see unavoidable loss at the polls. Which means he will strike out even more aggressively in every which way.

3-4 masks in that crowd.  Seems like a lot of Trump supporters are not very bright.
If you are not alarmed by Donald Trump calling to move the election, you are not paying attention.
I believe they're taking something, due to Trump's general germ phobia with all else, and his refusal to wear a mask. He enjoys appearing invinceable. Wasn't Pence positive for a while? I guess he didn't get it too seriously.
Can y'all help me spread the word to NC college students?   is hiring 2020 fall fellows to help us turn out the #youthvote. Great opportunity to build campaign organizing skills and add "defeated Trump/Tillis" to their resume.
Strange new phenomenon, not sure it’s documented in the literature yet.  My brain is starting to translate the word “China” into “Trump,” as in “Trump virus,” “Trump harms American businesses,” Trump’s represssive regime.”
Sorry! I meant that for Trump. Forgot to add his Twitter.
"The Government" will want to avoid their decisions being invalidated and being jailed for contempt of court, which is what would happen if Trump loses but they pretend otherwise. There will be a great many lawsuits, in addition to Ds running Congress
Idea: rename Alcatraz to Alcatrump, build a 200 foot “border wall” with no door in it around the island and exile Trump there forever and ever.
“Trump will only lose because he can’t govern” I mean, yeah, makes sense.
Impeach Trump on Nov 4. Walk the impeachment to the Senate on Jan 4.
Trump has always looked small to me. But today, he's a dust mite.
It's pretty clear that the President of the United States resists facts.   To survive the #Trump administration, scientists need to invest in a strategic vision
Trump is now trying to delay the elections! This is the same tactic that dictators all over the world use to try to thwart democratic elections when they fear loosing the elections. This is another revelation of the real character of Donald Trump and his leanings.
I live in the rural south. Don’t assume you know who I am or my circumstances.  I just happen to be smart enough not to buy Trump’s lies.
Too bad there wasn’t someway to protect himself from getting COVID19? Maybe Trump will lead the way and show America how?
Trump will be out of office and indicted within 6 months.
The thread is gibberish   There is no mechanism for a "do over" of a presidential election; we covered that in 2017  Elections can be delayed by any given state, but only briefly  The Electoral College will vote on 12/14, Congress will count on 1/6, Trump's term ends 1/20  12pm
I just looked it up and turns out the only reason trump tweeted this is that the owner was on TV this morning praising trump and complaining about loosing business for flying a trump flag. I guarantee trump never ate there.
Wouldn’t surprise me. I just looked it up and turns out the only reason trump tweeted this is that the owner was on TV this morning praising trump and complaining about loosing business for flying a trump flag.
That’s irrelevant to the point. The tweet I responded to said republicans didn’t disrespect Lewis. You lack basic comprehension skills like all trump supporters.

There are nearly 150,000 dead Americans because Trump wouldn’t take #COVID19 seriously. Sorry, your argument doesn’t hold up.  That spying, by the way, was on #Russia. If Trump hadn’t been in bed with them, he wouldn’t have been caught up in it.
Trump didn't wear a mask at that rally, either. Neither did any of the speakers. They're all still alive! I hope you mask fanatics learn something from this.
Wow, statistical genius!  Prez Trump doesn't wear masks much. He's still alive! I don't wear masks. I'm still alive! Jerry Nadler doesn't know how to wear a mask. He's still alive!  See a pattern there?
Hearing Barack Obama speak makes me even more angry that Donald Trump is our president.
The biggest issue with this upcoming election is the Supreme Court. We need trump out to preserve our rights. A vote for Biden is the only option. I won’t debate this
Carelessness with COVID has become an easy and visible way to signify where your loyalties lie. Trump seems to have recently realized that operating your campaign like a suicide squad isn’t a winning strategy and changed course. Unfortunately it’s too late for Cain.
News flash. There is NOTHING Trump can do that can upstage President Obama.
Proudly exposing yourself to COVID has been part of the Trump loyalist playbook for weeks. If Cain had been home with a mask over his face, Trump wouldn’t have wanted him on his campaign team.
Not sure if Obama is mourning the loss of John Lewis in this eulogy or destroying Donald Trump, but either way I’m loving it
I don’t care where Cain got it. I know the pandemic is worse because our leaders didn’t act, and I know that failing to protect yourself from COVID is part of the public image that Trump loyalists use to market themselves to Trump and to each other.
Watching Obama speak at the John Lewis toward and thinking about how our country was in a forward motion.  Then reading the news today and knowing how Donald Trump wants to send it way backwards by many decades.

Silly Trump, doesn't he know that only Democrats can make changes to the voting process?
Trump tells us that the virus is something we're going to have to learn to live with--free the states, open the schools! At the same time, he wants us to believe that we can't properly, securely and safely vote in November. Man, the news polls must be devastating.

More bullshit..DEMS DIDN'T SAY ALL MAIL IN VOTING!  So stop spreading bullshit. U ever see how many of Trump's staff voted w/mail in, absentee ballots? Y is it ok for them &amp; not average citizens?   Trump has 3 moths to get the COVID-19 undercontrol to insure SAFE VOTING! Will he?
So  wants to get rid of 1) voting 2) mail 3) mail-in ballots?  Seems simpler to just instead 4. vote Trump out of office using mail-in ballots sent through the mail.
Trump tweeted this today to take attention away from the fact that all Presidents except him were at the funeral for Civil Rights icon Senator John Lewis. Trump hates sharing the spotlight!
Donald Trump should Resign. Pass it on. And if he doesn't #WeWillVote
The same way you voting with trump 💯 of the time will come back to you?
I think this was dubbed by a Trump impersonator by the "good folks" at Project Veritas. Probably shouldn't fall for it.
LOL at people texting me in July of 2020 asking me to sign some fukkin online petition against Trump being mean to Fauci.
Trump has floated the idea before. The newest polls must be just as devastating as the last ones.
I think like Hitler, is he knows he lost he will burn the house down. He believes we screwed him! ‘Why don’t they like me?’ As Mary Trump explained, his ability to emote is restricted. He is devoid of empathy but derives pleasure from cruelty to his enemies- we are his enemies.
What happened to the British man who tried to shoot Trump?
Damn straight. We should vow to vote out anyone who doesn't offer a full-throated condemnation of Trump's musing about delaying the election. And that's all I have to say about it. Pretty sure this is Trump bidding for attention on a day when important events aren't about him.
So sad your boss’s massive ego killed him. Had to get Tulsa seats filled to watch Trump sip water and show his ramp-walking skills.
Probably not...but a few trump mentions away from $90/sh, or could be $10 tomorrow.
No, I’m not happy about this.  Yes, he supported Trump.  I’m furious that anyone continues to support a man who, essentially, helped kill someone who supported him.  Trust me, Trump won’t lose a minute of sleep over #HermanCain’s death. He doesn’t feel grief, or sympathy.

After President Trump floats the idea of delaying the general election, Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes that states that do universal mail-in ballots “get it right.”
⁦ is a sad, desperate, severely unfinished human.
Another person murdered by Donald Trump.
This is no coincidence, this is a deliberate act by Trump and his allies to curb mail in voting.
Can't say I'm surprised but Trump is now pushing to make the election invalid by any means necessary. He will likely be required to be removed from the White House by physical force when he loses.   Which will likely start a horrifying chain of events.  This is fine.
A good chunk of Trump’s voters think likewise I guess.
Trump is clearly afraid to lose and will do anything, including authoritarian measures, to make sure he doesn’t lose.   Register to #vote now and get ready to vote this orange lump out in November.
Herman Cain killed himself...for Donald Trump.
Trump rally maskless June 20, dead 40 days and 40 nights later. Sad! Mr. Cain chose to wear masks too late. Preventable deaths are tragic.
Trump's tweet about delaying the election is a distraction tactic meant to hide the worst quarterly economic numbers in our nation's history.
As 3 living presidents, Clinton, Bush and Obama, join together at Rep. John Lewis’s funeral, with Trump conspicuously absent, I am reminded that I sent Trump a book for #MLKDay, featuring pics of &amp; essay by John Lewis.
Gov. Brown is showing us how to lead collaboratively, by principle, and co-creating solutions to throw Trump's stormtroopers out of Portland. Congratulations, Gov. Brown for taking a principled stand.#leaderships4thevolution
trump is trying to delay the election after all the shit he talked about hurrying up &amp; opening things, getting people back to work.If we gotta put our masks on to go places YOU wanted open you can damn sure believe we won’t have a problem throwing our mask on to vote your ass OUT
"It is increasingly obvious that Trump’s only path to a second term is an illegitimate one. You can let that crush you, or use it as fuel." --
If Hillary couldn't beat Trump. Why in the world do people think that Joe Biden will? This is his 3rd time running for president. 😬🤔
Nah, trump is just an idiot.
Wonder if Trump will go to Herman Cain's funeral
Trump can squat in the WH all he wants. If he loses (and he will) as of Jan 20 he is no longer President and has NO legal power. Biden could literally set up office in a D.C. coffee shop and run the country.
Trump floats delaying Cyberpunk despite no authority to do so
Trump didn't lock down anything. He didn't want to take responsibility so like the coward he is, he left it to the governors and denied them federal aid.
I wonder how the other people in his group are doing. The Black folks he brought to try and get them to vote for trump
I thought this too, but I double checked and I’m fairly sure that he was positive at Trump’s rally but didn’t get it there. Which might be worse.
Tillis has no spine and will change his answer to whatever Trump wants.  NC has had enough. Bye bye Pence!  #GoCal!
Because he depends on votes from Trump loyalists. Also, lots of other reasons. But that's probably the big one.
The great embarrassment has already happened (trump being president at all). The sooner we elect a competent leader ( the better...
Senator Inhofe is behind Stitt. These congress people and senators who've been with Trump at different places carry it back to their families, staff, constituents, and colleagues. #Shameful pandering. #COVID19
Herman Cain may God rest his soul was nothing more to the GOP and Trump than their token black.
President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the guy running the Senate when the Vice President is off doing other stuff.  Nancy Pelosi is up for re-election, and so if the 2020 elections don't happen, she would be passed over for the same reason Trump wouldn't be president.
Herman Cain, a Black man who was a go hard for Trump, got Covid at a Trump rally, and died from said Covid!! All for a man who doesn’t give a f*ck about Herman Cain or anyone who looks like him. Talk about the fullest of circles.
trump: "i'm going to do a thing"  democrats: "trump can't do that thing"  trump: does the thing
Herman Cain Dead at 74 from COVID-19, Got Sick After Trump Tulsa Rally  via
Obama never said anything about delaying the election and conspiracy theorists went on and on about him setting up FEMA camps stacked with body bags in plans to stop the 2016 elections 🤦🏻‍♀️  Funny how Trump is literally their worst Obama nightmares and their fine with it
They had to break into coverage of the funeral of a towering Civil Rights icon to announce that Trump had killed one third of the GOP's living Black presidential candidates.
Then hello President Pelosi.  Which do you think Trump would hate more?  President Biden or NC President Pelosi?
Trump rally was June 20, he was diagnosed on June 29, and hospitalized on July 1. Could have been infected anywhere, but the Trump rally is certainly a possibility.
Indeed. A few of us covered this three years ago
It's not going to help your election hopes. You're screwed.
Contemplate what it means that a world that contained Congressman John Lewis also contained a President Donald Trump.
Wear A Mask is the lesson. Regardless of what Trump says, wear a mask and don't let someone talk you out of it. Worry about appearances and leave it off, you might end up sick.  Damn.  It hit him hard and fast.
Trump asked Blacks, "What do you have to loose?" Let's ask Herman Cain. #HermanCain
Open your eyes, sheep. How come only Republicans with stage 4 cancer that attend trump rallies with no masks on and ignore doctors and epidemiologists are dying from COVID???
buzzinga... Trump got you again!
Trump is getting nervous!!!
Spare us the BS Concern. We can see your pompons for Trump.

You mean the trump virus bc u let this happen yo us.
Ex presidents Obama, Clinton and Bush are today attending the funeral of civil rights campaigner John Lewis, a man who dedicated his life to others. Meanwhile, Trump spends his day trying to delay an election he knows he’ll lose. A man who dedicates his life entirely to himself
And this
#WearADamnMask and stop sucking up to Trump y’all.
Too bad he won’t be known for all of his personal accomplishments due to allowing himself to be used as republican/trump mascot that died as a result of trying to prove an idiotic point on some troll sht.
His blood is on Trump's hands.
Now is anyone still happy about the #COVID19 debacle that was the #Tulsa Trump rally?  #RIP ... i can only imagine there were others we will never hear about... 🤬
Trump is going to lose and he is going to be indicted.
Trump disrespected Lewis by refusing to attend the services memorializing him. Rubio disrespected him by posting a picture of another man while giving fake condolences. Stop it.
Please let this be the one time the GOP will stand up to Trump.
It's nothing but sad to see anyone sacrificed to the Trump Death Cult. Condolences to all who loved him. #RIPHermanCain
The leader of 'Black Voices for Trump", Herman Cain, dies from contracting coronavirus at a Trump rally. Few at the rally were wearing masks. He wasn't.  Now, trying to support Trump has gotten him killed. Do you think Trump cares? No he does not. Wake up, " Black Voices 4 Trump"
Sad and could have been avoided. More blood on Trump’s hands.
One way or another, Trump aims to undermine our election. It's why he insists he's leading when EVERY poll says otherwise. He said his internal polls show him in the lead. They don't. But by saying so, he's convincing his followers that if he doesn't win the election is "rigged".
Herman Cain, a former presidential hopeful who was once considered by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve, has died after being hospitalized with the coronavirus. He was 74.
Lmaoooo he was 74 and caught it at a trump rally FOH with this shit.
Herman Cain, a Morehouse man who went to Trump’s Tulsa Rally in June, has did from COVID-19. RIP , Sir. We didn’t agree on a thing, but no one deserves death.
Twitter to MKs: Unlike Trump tweets, Khamenei’s ‘eliminate Israel’ posts are ok  via
They can't even admit they've been ordered not to wear masks in order to support the theory that Covid is the flu. Who in their right mind ignores medical doctors' instructions and risks themselves for RU asset Trump? I feel the Republican snowball is starting to roll downhill.
Ok so Herman Cain bites it from Corona he got in Tulsa and first thing Trump tweets (after suggesting delaying the election) is to go try some pizza shop in Long Island? Is that a good tier shit post???
Agreed.This will prob play out very differently across states. It will be interesting to see if and where elites' attitudes change in expectation of a public opinion swing (e.g reaction to more Trump's attacks on the rules of the game) that may matter for subsequent races
Dictator in Chief, finally playing his "Trump Card."
BREAKING: Herman Cain, former Republican candidate for President, dies after reportedly contracting Covid-19 at Trump’s Tulsa Rally. He had been a Covid-19 denier and insisted on not wearing a mask.
Trump’s that kid on the elementary school playground who always quit the game right as they were about to get tagged because they knew they couldn’t run away.
Willful ignorance kills. Trump kills everything he touches
Remember when the GOP aholes said Trump would pivot to the middle once he became president? What a joke. Never in our history has one man tried so hard to divide it at every possible opportunity. Rich vs poor, black vs white, blue vs red, etc etc etc. #UnitedWeStandDividedWeFall
The symbolism of Cain, who is one of Trump's only high profile black supporters, basically being a human sacrifice to the Cult of Trump is just too much to handle. .
Texas deserves better than this clown! He will kill his own constituents and employees to curry favor with Trump.
Racist Trump gonna racist
Trump downplayed the virus for months. Still is. Trumps anti-mask rhetoric and example keep many from wearing them. Trump’s push to reopen too soon has stricken states like Florida and Texas.
I *knew* he would try this shit! Trump "requesting" an election delay, mark my word he and his cronies will do everything to invalidate any results that don't go his way.
You can’t pull numbers out of your ass and expect intelligent people to believe it Trump.
"Can the presidential election be canceled? No, it can’t. The terms of federal elected officials are set by the Constitution. Trump’s term ends on January 20, 2021."   "Can it be postponed? Almost certainly not."
It's clear now that Trump is engaged in active treason by attempting to delegitimize our electoral system.  EVERY Republican who allows a suggestion of delaying the election to stand unchallenged is complicit in treason.
Wrong.
John Lewis will be laid to rest in Atlanta today. Presidents Clinton,  Bush and Obama will be there but not the racist-in-chief. Mitch McConnell gave a nice eulogy in the capitol rotunda but Trump has no class.
Also, those thin blue line Trump shirts *shudder*
The grannies and the rest of us would rather risk death than let Trump stay.
Prob, the most effective checkup now would be for GOP members of Congress to stand up against this sounding balloon, rebuke Trump, and provide a stern defense of democratic institutions. But that would inconsistent with their behavior over the last n years. So, back to voters!👇
Here's the problem: if the people in power are complicit in breaking the law, if there's no meaningful enforcement, then the law is just words on paper. Who runs the election? Will they be complicit with Trump, or will they obey the law? Who can/will make them obey the law?
"[45] has no power over...election schedule... The Constitution states...exact date &amp; time when a [pres]...term ends. There is no clause that would allow [45] to remain in office beyond...Jan. 20 following...election." via
I've been detailing how Trump has been trying to consolidate power in the executive branch. He's stacking the courts with loyalists, ignoring them when they aren't in his pocket, and circumventing Congress's authority. If you still doubted his authoritarian agenda, here's proof.
Whether or not it's true, trump's timing of saying this 💩 about delays comes right after the media asking him about this, which makes it look like their fault. He's stupid, but not about things like this.
Trump, Republicans, Dems, Independents, Libertarians+ know he can't win.
Another news cycle spent talking about what Trump wants to talk about
President Trump wants to delay the election until Joe can safely leave his basement
That's a bad approach. If one can sue, both can sue.  It's like Trump has mind-melded with the worst attorney in history, and together they are crafting patently illegal decrees to enrich themselves.  Oh, wait...😬😟🙃
Without offering evidence to support his claim, Trump said mail-in voting will cause an “inaccurate and fraudulent” outcome.
There are some real BS responses popping up already. Schools need to be open but the election should be delayed?  Trump is just grasping at straws and none of his boys are willing to check him.  Country officially in recession-- Are we "great" yet?
Trump has done nothing, zero!!
60! 60! That’s at least twice what I figured trump had on his best ever IQ exam. Damn.
Surprise surprise. We need to start figuring out now how to get 45 out of office when he is voted out. There is no way he is going to accept the results of voting. What is the plan    ?
I get his tweets without following Trump!
I would legitimately risk exposure to coronavirus to vote Donald Trump out of office in November, if it comes to that. A pretty messed up thought to have to have, but here we are.
PRESIDENT TRUMP YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT, BUT CONGRESS WON'T DO THAT. YOUR POLLS ARE GOING UP. IN ORDER TO DO THAT, YOU WILL HAVE TO CHECK THE POST OFFICE WITH SECURITY TO CHECK THOSE MAIL-IN. SO KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. STAY POSITIVE.
Really wish all the folks saying trump doesn't have "the power" to commit all of these traitorous crimes would tell trump that am I right
We'll start with the president, the man who's gotten thousands of people killed with the Trump Virus. THAT's dereliction!
Trump cannot delay the election, right?!! Like that's unconstitutional or illegal or something?!! I think the secret service is going to have to drag him out while he is kicking and screaming when we vote him out in November.
Let's see whether his treasonous party will once again fall in line:
Having had his recently appointed stooge, Louis de Joy, work hard to cripple the USPS, Trump is now cashing in his chips by suggesting that voting by mail should not be an option.
I agree, Trump's losing it.

It has been very obvious since like February or March that Trump was mishandling this situation, in part, to demand the election be delayed. Like this is not surprising... right out of the fascism handbook
“trump wants to delay the election, but democrats say that will be bad for democracy. GOP senator X says that we need to learn more about this”  “in a partisan divide, trump wants to delay the elections while Dems want an election to happen”

Why on earth would Trump choose this morning to finally tweet out loud that we need to "delay the election"?
"The dates of federal elections are set by Congress, and the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 presidential inauguration."  There are limits to presidential power, even for Trump.
I'm sure Trump will react to this news with prudence, equanimity and self-reflection.

This is my last tweet to you. Everything I’ve shown is real historical data. The reality for macroeconomic trends is that presidential policies don’t tend to affect (not effect) them. The ONLY thing trump has done is blow up the deficit and bitch the COVID response. Goodbye.
At least he’s being brutally honest. Trump is airing out l the R’s true feelings &amp; dirty laundry.  No more hiding behind low taxes &amp; fiscal conservatism.  Just the unadulterated truth that y’all don’t want to be bothered with poor people, especially not poor Black&amp; brown people.

Dude, it’s tax law. Trump wrote out a bunch of middle class deductions like large portions of mortgage, medical, and student loan interest.
BA Williams is not ashamed to use projection as the Dems still have not accepted the election of 2016. So they are using the same argument now that they used in 2016 when they accused Trump of not accepting election outcome. Won't work this time either. Too bad.

The debt and the deficit are not the same thing. And trump has added to it just as much for one term. At least Obama’s debt additions got us out of the ‘08 recession. With trumps reckless spending, our children and grandchildren are going to be paying for his tax cut to the rich.
We have to be prepared for Trump crying "fake news" when he loses the election. It's going to take more than an election to get him out of office. He's gonna have to go kicking and screaming like the oversized toddler he is.
Nope. No change in trend for economic growth for more than 10 years and look at where things are now. The trump-botched COVID response wiped it all away. These were gains more than 10 years in the making. Trump is a failure in all non-partisan respects.

I don’t think all Trump supporters are bigots.  But GOP strategists sure seem to think a lot of them are.  If not, why run ads making a Jewish candidate’s nose look bigger or a Black candidate’s skin look darker?
Most Republicans, including those in Congress, are apparently happy to let Trump become an authoritarian leader as long as his authoritarianism has a social conservative [*cough* white supremacist] flavor. They won't stop him. So we have to stop him by voting him out.
Doing great! Yes Donald Trump even out of his mind. Dont let me bother you
The answer is in plain sight. Stone threatened to reveal what he knows about the evil deeds of Donald Trump and 30 minutes later, Trump commutes him.
It’s a function I never use, but twitter has lists and people follow the lists. So there are lists for Trump and lists for Liberals and everything under the sun. People follow these lists sometimes just to block people. So I got added to two opposing lists on the same day and bam
The fact that trump wants to eliminate the DACA sickens me. How is America home of the free and allows freedom but stripping young immigrants that are already here and being taught about the the constitution in schools!???? I DO NOT GET IT.
The number one danger of the Trump administration is its insidious consolidation of power in the executive branch. Concerns about a shift to authoritarianism aren't hyperbole. It's already underway. This should terrify you regardless of ideology.
Prior to the pandemic, there was no change in existing trends for economic growth or employment gains for more than 10 years. The only thing trump did was blow up the deficit. 1st chart is DJIA:
Trump sending federal agents to Cleveland is baffling to residents on the ground there. One tells me there havent been protests there in weeks, and that the order comes the same day his employer told him it was safe to return to work.   What is going on here?
Trump says they are staying. Then Gov. Brown says she talked with Pence and they will be leaving. Then acting Chad insists they are staying. Do these people not talk to each other?! The government is a disorganized mess with no clue what they are doing. #getthefuckoutofportland
The parenthetical "Also just awful" is superfluous. So is the "So racist," when applied to Trump!
BREAKiNG: I just wrapped an interview with  and he told me Pres Trump will accept the nomination IN Charlotte on the Monday of    Video coming soon #ncpol
Trump is now staking his whole reelection campaign on displays of paramilitary force. If this SOB wins again, civil war, baby.
Also should note that I'm seeing more of the context for this in terms of Trump's godawful racist tweet about affordable housing in the burbs.   To be clear, I want affordable housing everywhere, with more density, transit access, and less sprawl in and around our cities for all.
45 saying out loud what some in Chapel Hill believe, but don't say out loud (and some who do) amazing how close to Trump some liberals here sound
I’m talking specifically about the doc that Trump has tauting his wonder drug but really anything from Breitbart is trash
This is what Trump says to his base via  He tells them Democrats will attack them, literally, physically.  BTW, I live in a state led by a Democratic Governor in which the cities are led mostly by Democrats. We haven’t had the violence he claims is “everywhere.”
Trump didn’t do shit. BTW, it’s “an historic”.
You were one of 22 Republican Senators who wrote to  to urge him to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord after receiving over $250,000 in campaign contributions from oil and gas interests.
Fascism in America--Oregon.  Some of it has already happened, and more will happen as Trump fights to stay in power.

Susan Collins could have stopped Kavanaugh. She instead put a sexual assault accused to serve for life on the Supreme Court. She could have impeached Trump and derailed the corporate tax cuts. She didn’t and she needs to go. Vote  #MEPolitics #MEsen

Everytime I see this graph I'm thankful we have Donald Trump for President.  Trump is a real POTUS!!
Good news!   I hope this will include not just credentialed fed forces but all Trump secret police forces that have been violating protestors' civil rights!
I wonder how long that lasts after Trump, both for policy and demographic reasons.
U.S. nears 150,000 #coronavirus deaths, and Trump wonders “why doesn’t anybody like me?”  Here’s a hint: because you don’t care if they die.  Not a subtle hint, no, but you know Donnie doesn’t do subtle.
I know what your saying but Saudis could say they're ready to go through appeal tomorrow and act accordingly. The EPL and Bein should lobby with Trump to elect committee for WTO. If he does nothing thats not KSA fault, therefore shouldn't impact. Its 2 differing opinions now
If these numbers don't start dropping soon, Republicans are gonna be in deep sh*t in November. Trump was hoping a Nixonesque law-and-order campaign could mask his COVID incompetence   "About two in three Americans (65%) support the nationwide protests":
But trump is the Deep State
In many of the competitive districts we need to flip, a large majority of the voters who stayed home in past elections lean left.  And also, Greensboro is “Trump Country”?  #badpoliticaltakes
When Trump goes to prison, property values there will plummet. #TrumpRacism
Another follow the Trump Emulation.  We are not gullible
You’re absolutely right. Trump has to go. Please get all of your fellow patients at the inpatient mental health facility to vote for Biden.
YES. Not to mention the fact that Trump is a lifelong quitter who has never fought for anything, ever. He’s literally walked away from everything in his life that’s been the least bit difficult - marriages, businesses, tv shows. When he loses, he’ll leave. He’s not a fighter.
Evidence #765,139,228 of Trump’s racism.
"USA TODAY: Federal agents deploying to Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee"  Trump is trying to make the so-called battleground states true battlegrounds.
We need to reinforce this linkage. When NIMBYs NIMBY, we should constantly remind them that they are supporting the Trump administrations's racist and classist policy directives.
Still going, right?  Since it's a hoax, Trump has nothing to fear.  Again, right?
I think this conversation has run its course. It's just weird that you're trying to make the point that anyone said it would be impossible to maintain 2.4% GDP growth. Trump did not run on "the economy will be the exact same."
No, this is positive. Think innocent until proven guilty. The WTO has effectively been sidelined because of trump
Former FBI director Jim Comey, former CIA director Michael Hayden, and former WH communications director Anthony Scaramucci will attend a counter-convention in Charlotte when Trump accepts the nomination in late August. Will there be fireworks?
Difficult to tell because this is a more distant picture, but it looks like the anti-Trump/Pence group is fully masked, while in the pro-Trump group only a few wore masks. This is why we can't have nice things.
I’d go with Ducky. She seems like the best pick for the Do No Harm strategy and I’m not sure she actually has presidential ambitions herself. Good counter to Trump’s attempted ‘law and order’ stance too
#RussianBounty story from  and  has Trump admitting he knew about Russia supplying weapons to the Taliban and claiming the bounty info “never reached his desk.” Multiple reports say it was in the PDB.  Damning interview and even worse Trump makeup here.
Trump can be a horrible choice without making Biden a good choice.
Donald John Trump's single saving grace is his incompetence... God forbid he simultaneously practice wickedness and competence
I was referencing the last three years of the Obama presidency, at which point the recession was four years past.  Nobody said Trump couldn't keep up those growth rates, Trump claimed he could get 5.
Lamar Jackson likes Donald Trump so maybe he doesn't have the best judgment.
Trump has to get his new orders from Putin.
A reminder that with Trump, Russia's interest holds a &gt;50% interest that the US; and the Putin father-figure psychology and what Putin knows about Trump means Trump is co-opted. Also, many things indicate that Trump's next big goal in life is a Trump-Moscow hotel.
Yeah, I’m a real piece of shit. Someone put me on a list as a Trump guy and someone else put me on a list as a liberal on the same day and I got blocked by a bunch of people I have never interacted with. Strange times.
Trump rewrites history to fit his limited knowledge.
Trump is the fascist president too many in the US have been waiting for.
I remember in 2016 when I traveled through NC, VA, WV and Ohio that is ALL I seen was tRump signs. Glad to say I have only seen a few in comparison!
Did the Trump campaign make an indiscriminate ad buy on YouTube, or are they specifically targeting folks who watch yoga videos? How many people want to make America great again and also want some intense low back stretches and shoulder openers?
Mr future president please do not call trump " president" he's not, he's only a leader of a bunch of ignorant and racist people.
Trump didn't do anything anyone said was "impossible." The economy grew at 2.4% per year in his first three years, the literal exact same rate it grew in the last three years of the Obama presidency.  Job growth was actually worse under Trump. Rate of wage growth was even too.
So Republicans want to cut the $600 unemployment supplement.   Democrats want to keep it.   And Trump just criticized Dems for being .. too stingey on the supplement, saying it should be bigger. Hard to see any rationale for that argument.
The trump campaign is running ads that are getting increasingly violent and terrifying, showing old women and children in danger because Biden wants to defund the police (he doesn't and won't).   I'm rarely shocked by any of this these days but wow there really is no bottom huh
Even if Biden doesn't win the state (which is likely), Trump will still have to dump tons of money into Georgia just to keep it red. That will hurt his campaign elsewhere.
It’s an obsession of proving Trump was correct all along, the constraints of reality be damned. I swear I would never work this hard at constructing delusions so a loony dude in my chosen political party gets a second term. 😒 I don’t get it.
If you don’t wanna vote, fine. I’m not even gonna try to sell you on Biden. That’s not my job. But assuming you wish to vote out Trump, this is your chance to do so. Act accordingly

Great, and mildly re-assuring post from John. However, Trump will never, ever resign. His ego won’t allow it and his sunk costs are too high not to mention criminal prosecution awaits him once he leaves office. Nope, he’s in until the end. Whenever that ends up being.
President Donald John Trump &amp; Senator Addison Mitchell McConnell, It is time that you stop thinking about getting reelected and do the jobs you were elected to do. The people need the two of you to be leaders.  Bring the bills to the floor and send the private troops/police home

You’re not going to find anyone to disagree with this but I do think it’s an absurd deflection from everything else that’s going on right now. Nothing about the 32.9% drop in GDP, Trump signaling his desire to postpone the election, or his continued promoting of Russian interests

It's just like listening to the Governor/Dictator of Oregon! Those government stormtroopers are causing of the problems! Our peaceful protesters were destroying the Federal Courthouse without any issues until Trump started causing all of our problems! #POS #Liar
And what happens if the states controlled by GOP governors and legislatures fall in line with Trump and agree to delay the date? Will you come out against Trump’s destabilizing rhetoric then? Going to be far, FAR too late.
Trump can't cancel or postpone the November election over mail voting - Business Insider
Can Trump cancel the November election because of coronavirus? - NO he can’t.
Trump Suggests Unprecedented Delay to November Election — But Congress Sets the Date – no delays, not one minute.
I hope everyone is ready to physically remove Trump by any means necessary come January if not sooner. It’s enough already. WE THE PEOPLE.  Trump is not a dictator a king or a god. He is simply a mentally ill, extraordinarily evil old white man.
Trump floats delaying November election - Axios.  Anyone surprised?
Mr. Olsen, will you apologize to  now that Trump has actually done what you said would never happen and suggested delaying the election? It clearly isn’t “over the line” as you said back in April.
Changing the date of a federal election would require an act of Congress. And the Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the presidential inauguration.
Trump the Usurper.
No. Nope. Negative.  Absolutely not.
President Donald Trump proposed delaying the election in a tweet on Thursday, but only Congress has the authority to delay the election.
Too bad you don’t have the authority to do it. November is gonna be ugly. We need to be prepared that we won’t know who won for a while. AG Barr admitted under oath that they have no proof of voter fraud. Trump is setting the table to contest the results.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Think I’m joking or don’t know what I’m talking about? Think again.   In a new poll, half of Republicans say they would support postponing the 2020 election if Trump proposed it
When Republicans fall in line and support Trump’s idea to delay the election (let’s be real, they WILL support it if for nothing else than to give RBG more time to die &amp; be replaced) you’ll be kicking yourself for thinking Trump didn’t have the authority to move the date.
Trump is doing it, so of course not.
THIS IS FASCISM. It's official now, the USA is living under a Fascist regime.  BBC News - Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 US presidential election   #FascismHasComeToAmerica

Are you going to write a follow up for this article now that Trump has committed treason?
As the epidemiologists predicted, US daily coronavirus cases have reached a new plateau, much higher than the unacceptably high April-May plateau, and daily deaths are on a trend line back to May levels &amp; toward all-time US highs.  Trump/GOP reopening.
BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election   -&gt;&gt; What the fuck are you doing posting shit like this?  Trump just does shit like this to drive a media cycle.... stop playing into his narrative.
Time to play the “What would Republicans do if Obama has suggested this?” game.   Go on, try and imagine what would have happened if Barack Obama has even HINTED at delaying the Presidential election.  SO tired of the Trump double standard with the GOP.
Fuck no.  BBC News - Trump calls for delay to 2020 US election
"You'd think...facing most profound economic crisis since '30s, married 2 public health disaster &amp; growing unrest over racial injustice, party tht controls WH &amp; Senate wld get serious.  Insted, Senate’s GOP majority &amp; Trump WH r in chaos, unable to produce a coherent relief bill"
That's what this Election is about! Like George W Bush, Trump has started another Recession Jobs Homes Cars all lost! It took Obama to get US out of the Bush Recession and now Joe Biden!!!
As Fed Chair Powell said Our Economy just shrank by about 33% and Congress and Senate Republicans haven't done a Damn Thing! Those Stimulus Checks should have already been sent out as Fed Chair Powell warned McConnell! GO BIG! 1200 Hundred Dollars is Neither! Trump Very Generous!
"McConnell accused Democrats of adopting a “completely unhinged position”"  ANNOUNCER: "McConnell &amp; Trump WH have NO position."
"“There’s no consensus on anything,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters twice after a closed-door lunch with Meadows &amp; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin."  ANNOUNCER: "Deadline tomorrow, House has had its bill 4 months. Senate GOP &amp; Trump WH, "no consensus on anything."
He’s right, he is going to win. There aren’t hidden voters for Trump, instead there are people with HUGE Trump flags all over rural America in their yards that pollsters assume won’t vote because they rarely if ever do.
It is the responsibility of every eligible voter to hold this man accountable. If the thought of four more years with Trump turns your stomach.... Vote for Biden
"“The rest of it, we’re so far apart, we don’t care, we really don’t care,” Trump told reporters outside the White House, referring to divisions between the two parties."
Trump WH &amp; GOP "could send the economy reeling":
Don't do that. Trump's Storm Troopers might start following you around waiting for orders.

Godspeed to all the USA residents that have to endure the trauma that this trump violence has inflicted on them. THEIR only hope is to elect people like Biden in November. #TrumpHatesWomen #VoteBlue
Well pass the majority has on mask . 5 people at Trump event
Trump is trying to Distract from the 150 Thousand Corona Virus Deaths by saying Joe Biden wants to Defund Police! When Biden just wants to Ban Choke Holds! Trump's trying to scare Seniors! Do Not be Fooled!!!!
Not people’s looks...just trump. And with all the death, riots, and racist talk, if all that’s done to trump is making fun of his looks...then he got off easy.
Trump wanting to Remove 12 Thousand Americans Troops from Germany is just doing Putin a Favor! A way to invade Germany like the Ukraine!!!!
Tha God on the Breakfast Club said Senator Karma Harris makes Old White Men Nervous! Like Trump and McConnell!
Senator Karma Harris will beat Trump and Pence like a Red Headed Step Child the way she debated Vice President Joe Biden just shows how Tough she is! Warren and Others are good Candidates, but Our African American Friends won't support a White Woman!!!
You’re advocating for a middle-aged steroid using Bezos to be president, welp it’s an improvement over Trump I suppose.
Too intelligent to be the real Trump Really good deep fake though

This is an opinion piece! Another Trump hating opinion piece. The ONLY THING that matters is he opened his club to blacks and Jews and the other clubs didn't!
I’m glad you agree in reality: real criminals like Trump and his cronies need to go to jail. #TrumpsGestapo
That’s a lame argument. Nice attempt at laying all the ‘COVID deaths’ at Trumps feet. Typical lefty deflection. Rice is a proven hack and Pence will mop the floor with anyone that Biden..errr the DNC picks as VP, just as Trump will demolish Sloe Biden in the debates.
Don't you get it... Trump is a strange visitor from another planet. He wasn't born on Earth. He's not a native born American.
Satan scored HUGE the day social networking began! Been saying it for years...I have no Facebook or instagram or any other networking except twitter an that was to follow Trump. Evil!!
I saw your interview with Trump Advisor Navarro... I always knew but you confirmed for America how much of a hack you truly are... what a disgrace. You should be ashamed of yourself.. You won’t be which makes me want to vomit.
Several attendees at President Trump's Texas event appear to not be wearing masks or adhering to social distancing guidelines.   No mask, no social distancing. Not a blacklivesmatter in site ,so 🤣🤣🤣
It’s scary. For every time Trump lies about being invited to throw at the opening MLB game, he’s dog whistling at white suburbanites about segregating their neighborhoods from “low income housing”.
Brush I always have to triple check tnat this ain’t a trump spam or parody account. But it never is. It’s ALWAYS HIM.
Let's agree on one thing..  Trump can't find his ass using both hands.
Yonkers is almost certainly the most recent data point on public housing in Trump's memory sewer

“Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it.”
You’re right it’s July 29th - sorry.   I didn’t say anything about Trump?? I just think it’s odd the world is shut down, schools can’t reopen and she just now makes it mandatory? Nothing to do with anyone else I just think it’s weird.

Trump certainly has no obligation to push Christian values, but the reason it matters here is that he is the president of the evangelicals.
It was his proudest moment!! Just like Jimmy Acosta getting dressed down by President Trump and being called Fake News and a disgrace to journalism!! Any Fame is good Fame, no matter how despicable! Ali finally made the Big Time, he is Fake News Too!!

It’s no secret that Trump wants to abolish Obamacare and trusting him to protect coverage for preexisting illnesses is shaky at best. So the voter is triggered and votes for Trump, against their own interest of having a healthcare insurance provision 5/
For example, a voter may be on an Obamacare plan, with several preexisting illnesses, but are dissatisfied and distrusting of the care they have received. So Trump’s pro-hydroxychloroquine and anti-Fauci comments trigger that voter towards supporting him. 4/

How did Fauci get Trump to wear a mask? He told him it was a pair of Ivanka's panties.
Think about kids who were brought to the USA bf June 2007 who turned 15yo after Trump tried to terminate #DACA the 1st time. These teens &amp; young adults are arbitrarily being excluded from the DACA protection. The word cruel doesn’t adequately capture; it’s bullshit.#TrumpsGestapo
The program expired, but I was a recipient of the program in 2016 when we bought our first home. The program is far less generous now.
If a new round of Stimulus Checks isn't approved Quickly like the Secretary of the Treasury said, We will blame Congress and Senate Republicans! Trump said the next round of Stimulus Chec would be Very Good and Very Generous! 1200 Hundred Dollars won't last a day! 2 thousand!
And Trump is Trying To Rase Drug Prices Cause Trump Has Stock in That’s Why He Was Pushing That One Drug saying that it will cure the virus which the FDA says other wise.
I see That Trump is Tweeting about everything else Except About Barr Testifing. ROFL
We Americans don't want Demmings for Vice President! We want Senator Karma Harris! She's Tough as Nails and won't go easy on Trump or Pence! Former Federal Prosecutor and at 55 years old She could immediately start running Our Country!!!
If I was getting 1 Thousand dollars a week for Unemployment. What the Hell would I need another 6 Hundred dollars a week! I have to agree with the Republicans to cut back on Unemployment payments and make the next round of Stimulus Checks Big and Very Generous as Trump said!!!!
Trump Campaign Obscured $170 Million in Payments, Complaint Says
This was actually already a plan in North Carolina that many people (including my husband and I) greatly benefited from.
I’m a Republican (maybe not after trump) and I have voted Democrat 3 times. I try to vote for the person and not necessarily the party. I will be voting Democrat (straight ticket). The GOP has become the GTP (grand trump party) and that’s not my party.
ok one little side trip over to Gizmodo...done now!
The Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Trump failed to follow appropriate procedure when he tried to end DACA, but affirmed his ability to do so.

We are not fooled, Barr &amp; Trump. “Antifa” is your invention to demonize First Amendment protest against you. Your white supremacy friends are pretending to be these fictional characters.
Your questions for #Barr have sucked. Throwing softballs.   Been a Dem since I could vote, &amp; the piss-poor job Dems have done on oversight throughout Trump's presidency makes it all look like a sham.  I think Trump is a top eschelon confidential informant, and both sides know it.
Trump is a criminal. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure

TRUMP: Elect me so I can spend the next four years fixing the mess I made during my first four years.
Based on this line of questioning, and Barr’s non-answers, I know more about Trump and Stone being in cahoots than Barr 😒.
I mean they assume he is Trump’s lacky but from what I am hearing it sure doesn’t sound like it. I mean yeah its never good to rat out the boss in any situation but he seems to be doing his job and honestly answering questions to his own true convictions.
This line of questioning is at least making it glaringly clear that Barr is Trump’s royal bottom wiper.
Yep saw that - it's like they're HELPING Trump.
Donald J Trump. Did you know the J stands for jackass!  So appropriate!
Trump wants walk in voting and voter id, so the Dems must be the thieves!
Honestly I am not a conspiracy theorist but Trump going after John O. Brenan former Director of CIA and the well organized/funded Antifa Org and Social unrest may have CIA or Dark Intelligence written all over it!  Suspicious?

I'm watching the Barr hearing from the beginning and I'm unsurprised to see Congressman Jordan continue to be an embarrassment. He's putting on a rather gross performance to suck up to Trump and Barr.

Trump keeps pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, is an effective treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Barr hearing began with Nadler lecturing everyone about how bad Barr is without going into detail, saying he ruined DoJ and Trump picked him last.  Then Jordan comes in with an intricate breakdown of Obamagate and we are 5 mins into a video of the riots that don't exist.  Brutal.
Tried to watch the senate judiciary committee questioning Bill Bar but after just 30 seconds of Jim Jordan’s obsequious Trump ass kissing and I’m done.
Donald Trump is only puppet listening for the Republicans, he doesn’t have a thought of his own.

Al Green was right beside Lewis in boycotting Trump’s inauguration &amp; he along w/Water’s screamed “Impeach 45” even befor the President took oath of Office. How can either of these individuals be remembered as trying to bring America together. They didn’t heal the Nation.
John Lewis never recognized Trump to be duly elected President. Last night Fox had Al Green on their Program giving his eulogy about Lewis’s accomplishments. He may have been respected by those in Civil Rights Movement but when boycotting inauguration he lost mine.
Most definitely. I live next to Camp Lejeune here in Jacksonville North Carolina. All the veterans and service members are America loving Patriots. Not seen 1 Biden sign but a whole lot of Trump flags.
Doesn’t America deserve to know Biden’s involvement concerning the FISA Warrants? He &amp; Obama both knew Mueller’s Investigation was unpredicated &amp; unwarranted. They knew from the beginning yet remained silent while Trump was made to suffer, protecting his reputation.

3 men ran Campaigns from a basement. 2 were leading a War Campaign w/1 of them being Hitler, who eventually failed. 1 was Soviet Ldr Stalin successfully managed the war from beneath the streets of Moscow. It’s not Trump who should be compared to Hitler it’s Biden.
Aristimuno has no business being on your show. He didn’t answer 3/4 of the questions put to him &amp; when he did attempt to answers he jumped around like a Mexican jumping bean. Biden can’t hide, unless he’s just plain afraid to confront Trump. I think that this IS his problem.

Trump continues to treat COVID-19 like it's a hoax. He put all those people's lives in danger when he held that rally in Tulsa, OK. Even made them sign a waiver so they wouldn't sue. #inners
Sounds great.  Thanks Trump.

Very cool but none of this is what Trump was talking about. He was talking about injecting disinfectants. Not light.
Count down to re-election of Trump who fixed 8  years of O'bama failure in which O'bama himself said his bad economy and high unemployment rate was the new normal
Okay. That may be too harsh. But I am wheezing at the ignorance. Like sir what are your children gonna tell your grandkids? You literally went to a trump rally with no mask on during a pandemic. Y’all I’m screaming. Lol.
Yes, he was, and thank God for Trump! Obama was the worst president the US has ever had.
(ALERT) Mike Pompeo just testified under oath that *Barr* will decide if Trump—despite having no constitutional authority to do so—can *announce* he's moving the election.  Read that sentence multiple times and then retweet this. We're witnessing a historic threat to rule of law.
Fairly sure trump was not talking about that. Nowhere in that article it talks about an injection. Did you read it? Injecting light is not a thing. At least not yet. It would require suspending a photon in space long enough to be injected.
Sorry but I have been cackling at that old man basically dying at a trump rally. Like that’s how he went out? With no mask? And a black republican? Lmaooooooooooo sorry I AM LAUGHING.

Trump's self serving. These actions taken by his administration is unethical. If he gets voted out of office the new President should have the federal government look into his business practices. Pressure him until he disappears. I support our Postal Service don't mess with them.
Trump does not use conversation to exchange ideas or information, he is constantly eliciting an emotional response. For some strange reason, he’s a person more comfortable with emotional reactions which also explains his combative nature and pettiness
Wonder if trump watched it, secretly

Trump is orange, so Bidens handlers said ... paint him orange too, and it was so.  When you can't run on your policy the only thing you have left is appearances, so why let Trump be the only orange candidate?  amiright?
Interesting because the CDC praised trump for closing the border to China on Jan 30.  Also 40% of Covid deaths are due to poor Democrat leadership in 5 states by putting the sick in nursing homes.
Do you have proof Biden has dementia ? We have proof Trump is racist. Do you have proof Biden is anti Isreal? Trump is the wrong choice and if you don’t think he would turn on Isreal at the drop of a hat like everyone else he has then you are sadly mistaken.

Until this tweet  I read all the prior tweets in this chain as an eulogy to Herman Cain. He had an Impressive background! RIP 🙏 But this tweet sounds very political! Are u looking for a role in Trump re-election campaign?
Do you support postponing the November election? You don’t have the fortitude to comment on that do you? That’s because Trump &amp; his Russian backers own you. We need a senator who represents us, not a Trump lackey like you,
Right 🙄
That's not possible, because there's nothing positive to say about Biden. He's not Trump and that's that.
Maybe he did? Admitting it now would show his unbending support of hydroxycholorquine to be the sham that it is. Therefore, even if he did, we'll never hear of it. On the flip side, had Herman Cain recovered, we'd never hear the end of it. For Trump, it's a win win.

It would be *perfectly constitutional* for state legislatures sympathetic to Trump to decide to adopt a different manner of choosing its electors, effectively cancelling the popular vote. Then they could empower themselves to choose the state's electors.  4/

Art. II, Sec. 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the election's date. Since the mid-1800s, the date has been set for the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.  Trump can't do anything about that without Congress going along. And it won't.  2/

I can certainly understand Joe not wanting to debate due to his dementia, but I would think Trump with his ego would give it a go.
Really? What happened to no concerns we got this under full control.... Trump’s stated concern for poll safety defies his otherwise aggressive push to “reopen” the nation from partial shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus, even as rising confirmed coronavirus cases,
After President Trump floats the idea of delaying the general election, Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes that states that do universal mail-in ballots “get it right.”
This is sad as a fellow Morehouse Graduate 🎓 RIP Herman Cain He died for Trump
How about your Trump virus killing over 150000 Americans
Trump is a lot of things ... but funny is Not one Nor is joking about our constitutional over reach of violations   As we have seen him fire hire and joke about arresting people  none of which belongs on a social app
Trump is deflecting from economic news. That is the story.
Trump drinks illumanti blood too though
Obama knows Trump knows the shit.  Let's get it done.
No ! I love POTUS Trump; best POTUS since Reagan ! Wake up and smell the coffee.

It’s Trump’s pinned tweet now.
Hoping Obama is moved enough to take up the baton from John Lewis and continue to lead. No one motivates like Obama. No one else can get trump and Putin back in line.
I should have realized sooner that Trump attacking USPS was to thwart mail in voting
Hope Trump is watching President Obama’s eulogizing of John Lewis.  Trump could learn a lot about real democracy; NOT Russia’s version that he practices!

Plop me in ANY American city and I could drive 2 hours and find you a confederate, blueline, and trump flag. Hillbilly rednecks love them some (racist) flags.
We need proactive leaders in power and right now the GOP doesn’t have any it seems. Then trump says the dems aren’t doing enough to help people when his own gop announce a smaller recovery bill. It’s just astonishing the lies and hippocracy.
Not only that, but then trump and the gop said dems need to get moving and make something happen. Almost as if dems hadn’t passed a bill nearly three months ago that the gop didn’t even debate until after the original bill ran out. Reactionary government isn’t good enough.
In an effort to keep the poll lines shorter than normal, Republican voting will be delayed by one week. Trump voters, your new voting date is November 10th.  Biden voters, you are still to vote on November 3rd.

I believe that the democrat's coordinated with the Chinese government to allow this virus on the world all in attempt to blame President Trump because they know that they can't beat Trump 2020 on a level playing field
Let me be very clear, if Trump tries to delay the election I will be heading to Washington, along with millions of fellow Americans, I will be armed, and I will be ready to take back our country.
Trump is disgusting and his enablers are even more so. The Republican party is a morally corrupt zombie party. If you still support Republicans, you're supporting thieves, liars, grifters, cheats, rapists, &amp; child molesters.

Just in case you haven't been paying attention.... Demonrat leaders, antifa, blm, the WHO, the CDC, CNN, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Biden, Soros &amp; Obama have guaranteed Trump's reelection. Every statement, response and action made gives Trump a few thousand more votes. TRUMP2020
A lot of ppl were to “blame” then. Including Bernard. So again, ppl need to know history and context. And yes the end story is 4 more years of trump lor not. Bc then these ppl wanna be at the protests of trump wins.. nah
I'm still waiting for any of you to present evidence of a crime.  ANY.  I understand your hatred of Trump blinds you to facts, and I'm sorry you're so filled with hate, but it doesn't change the fact y'all haven't presented any actual facts.  Just hurt feelings.
Trump doesn’t joke, everyone knows that.
If anybody that I know votes for Donald Trump or doesn't vote at all in this coming election you can stay away from me; you're not the type of person I want to be around or that's deserving of my time &amp; conversation. You lack the moral character of a good friend &amp; human being.
I mean, Donald Trump also made it very clear that we were only going to have 15 COVID cases and that would go down to zero. He said that in February.
He put Trump's call on speakerphone to hear better as he sat in a Washington restaurant. These people are terrible at governmenting.
Trump is no defender of the Second Amendment.
So you know how Barr got the 3 judges to essentially throw out Flynn’s guilty plea-this means the entire panel of judges will reconsider that ruling. Now there will be a much better chance of Flynn’s guilty plea standing and him going to jail-til Trump pardon

Then why would I support Biden?  His platform is a massive increase in size and scope of government.    Trump has not controlled spending and that bothers me but part of it is that Congress and politics (we may be in minority regarding size of govt) force him to compromise

Black people don't have white options as most of white Americans will vote for trump or any other Republican running for president. Which means every black vote is needed or you're helping to maintain the white supremacy powerhold.
Be sure to look at this plot. Here's why Trump is panicking and tweeting crazy shit today.
He died from his own ignorant stubbornness and from listening to trump. No dancing, just a face-palm. A simple piece of cloth could have saved his life. Smdh.
The left just do anything to discredit Trump. First they overhype the death number, then they neglect the recovery rate, then they blame us as racist for whatever reason.   Virus from China? Right wing racist! Why there’s looting? Because right wing racist!🤣  Crazy, I tell ya 🙃
The Herman Cain account can delete the tweet but it’s already out. Everyone knows he was a Trump following science denying Covidiot and now he’s dead. Priceless
you are hilarious!!!!!!    Did you know that Nancy Pelosi will be acting president if he delays the election? I found out today, apparently so did Trump.
True. It’s real. I’ve seen victims of it. People with no underlaying cases who suffers terribly because of it. But MSM media is responsible for arming the pandemic to discredit Trump and blowing it out of the proportion.
He’s standing behind Trump whose pants are getting darker.
After attending Trump rally without a mask... I feel so bad for his family.
I do believe Trump, the last time, said, “I never joke.”
I came of age during the Nixon Administration and it was kindergarten compared with this shit show !!!!! By saying that they minimize Trump 🤦🏻‍♀️
Trump suggested postponing the election.
The more Trump has rallies the less followers he’s going to have.   But that fact escapes him like a woman cornered by his shitty personality and dump truck of Tic Tacks.
Uhhh if you're not voting for Biden you're saying it's ok for trump to stay in office. No black group in the history of black groups would say leave trump in office, except Republicans in blackface.
If trump had acknowledged the virus and not deemed it a hoax the Oklahoma rally would have been delayed until it was safe to return to such activities and Herman Cain would be alive today

In reality, Athens' strategy of domination and governance via fear was a large part of what doomed them not long after Melos fell.   That said, the Dialogue in proper context is still instructive and valuable, especially given Trump's mindset of might-makes-right foreign policy.
This was meant in a political/electoral context and in response to those saying Trump’s crazy talk is to distract from the GDP numbers.  In other words, it’s not the report that impacts elections, it’s the underlying condition.

Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail
Yes. Trump made the coronavirus. #Facetious
....because he went to a stupid Trump rally.  Good job, GOP.  Good job, Trump.
Facts are just that, facts. He died  supporting the very rhetoric that took him outta here.  #HermainCain #WakeUp #Trump Trump won't attend anything for him either. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Too bad Trump can’t be bothered to acknowledge it ... he would need to accept fact the he died from Covid and it was preventable if he wore a mask.
But even if the courts fail to force a state to hold an 11/4 election, it'd have to be a tipping a point state on the way to Biden winning 538.  That state doesn't exist because any governor that'd even be tempted governs a safe Trump state.
The most Trump can do is advise the states to delay their elections. Which the Governors won't do because 1) there's no political upside for them 2) there's massive political downside risk.  But even a few try, the courts would force them.
Trump musing about delaying the election is really bad. An unimaginable breach of trust. A bridge too far.  But also, the Executive Branch (Trump) doesn't control elections. The Federal Government doesn't control elections. States do.
Only Adolf Trump would float the idea of moving an election that will kick him out of office. Spoken like a true dictator.
Damn. He probably got it at Trump's Tulsa rally, which means that Trump contributed to killing him.
If Trump successfully disrupts this election so he can have four more years to establish a dictatorship I won’t be surprised. Stunned? Yes. But it’s a very real potential that may be a part of getting into the next era of this country.
He was a grown man who made his own choices.  I hate trump but he didn’t force him to do anything.
For some reason, I'm suspicious that Mr. Trump does not know this.
Let me go ahead and put in my mail-in voting request? What’s the procedure, where do I start? Because it’s looking like Trump is downsizing USPS for re-election and there’s not enough volume on it for me.
I don't care what anyone says, I'm going to say it, it's on the tip of everyone's tongue, Donald Trump killed Herman Cain. Well, maybe more assisted suicide. I know, I'm wrong.
what are we doing?!   predicted that Trump would try to delay the election.

and it’s not only his supporters. even people who don’t support trump were likely affected by that rally. that’s why the whole “i should be able to choose what i am able to do” thing doesn’t work
Deniers will say he died of something else, and continue to maintain that COVID-19 is a hoax created by the deep state to keep Trump out of office.
A Covidiot proved us libs wrong right?!?  Dead for nothing because he and Trump were proving it’s a Liberal hoax. He would have had my family die following his science denying stupidity. Well guess what?  Fuck him.
Trump promoted stupidity and the MAGA sheep followed.  I'm sorry for his family too, but this was avoidable, this was stupidity, this was selfish.
The military, federal law enforcement agencies, and local police... they can change that because they have guns, all they have to do is to decide they want to be loyal to Trump
Can you imagine the horrors the Libs would raise if RBG did pass while Trump is in office? It would make the last 2 months in Portland look like a playground.   And Cons would honor her legacy, which would also piss off the libs.

For better or worse how you view the man, Herman Cain’s death was an unnecessary result of politicization and misinformation. That + COVID killed him. All that began with Trump’s need for an optical illusion of strong man success over a “bad guy” with his political rivals.
Reporters beware. If Trump has his way, you guys couldn't report the truth. You'd be jailed for suggesting anything contrary to his "exemplary" performance. Where's the outrage?
Rest In Peace Herman Cain. Maybe should’ve thought twice about attending that Trump rally in Oklahoma back in May, COVID IS REAL.
“Wait! This is going to go on all day &amp; all the other presidents are there making me look bad! WTF”.... words trump would like to tweet &amp; might still do today.
Exactly. If Trump isn't reelected then his presidency ends at noon on January 20th.
Trump can NOT delay the election. He’s just preparing his people for a loss. This way he can say it was a rigged &amp; unfair election...it wasn’t because he sucked.
He was trying to convince people to act stupid like Trump wanted and it killed him. He was an idiot leading idiots. I’ll bet he gasped for days and hours thinking what an idiot he was while some ghost writer on his twitter handle spewed nonsense.  Wear a mask!!!
Keep yelling it from the rooftops. Trump always tells us who he is and what he intends to do. And then he does it. He doesn’t have to actually delay the election, just sow so much chaos that the results are in question.

I think the Constitution ends the president's term Jan 20th, even if an election for some reason isn't held. Since Trump and Pence would have to vacate the WH, the next in line would be Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.
Spot on but somebody got to change Obama for trump
Biden is a career politician.  If he pardons Trump, it would be because the congressional GOP made him a deal that was worth the political fallout.

You enabled Trump. You excused Trump. You defended Trump. This is but one more in a long list of tweets and actions.  If I were you, I would slither away from the public spotlight and do nothing. The only thing you have left to contribute to this Earth is your departure from it.
It's sad that he and many other will die when their deaths were completely avoidable. If it either wore an N95 mask or didn't go to the Tusla Trump rally at all, he would most likely still be alive today. And it happens to many anti-maskers. Please wear a mask and avoid crowds
I'd like to get this topic polled. In the event Trump's tweet is included in the question, how many Republicans do you think would agree? I'm going with at least a plurality.
Absolutely NUTS. Trump cultists, he will kill u! Dont believe the lies!
Maybe if you and your ilk had not spent the last 5 years defending this man and every un-Constitutional, un-patriotic, and deeply un-American thing he said and did, we wouldn't be here!  I don't blame Trump. I blame YOU!
I am deeply saddened by his death but he did not die because of the Trump rally. He died from contracting the virus with underlying health issues.
You’re so gullible, exactly he reaction Trump expected to get from the left when he tweeted that.    And the economy just had its worst dip bc left wing politicians continue to keep their cities locked down - what did you expect to happen to the economy?!?
His last public appearance was the tRump rally in Tulsa... he didn't wear a mask at all.
Donald Trump must resign. Pass it on.
Don’t let Trump off the hook regarding the death of Herman Cain who died today after contracting COVID-19 at the Tulsa Rally.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Cain, in hell: But the Corona virus was a hoax. Trump is God's chosen one Satan:
Yeah, and he was at the last Trump rally without wearing a mask smh
There is bad economic news but y’all talking about Trump delaying the election instead...
To be the reporter to ask Trump about Herman Cain passing and his rally in Tulsa being the likely stage where he contracted it...
Another death by Trump! May he RIP and May his family be protected! #TrumpVirus
Trump is just following Putin's  orders.
Sad to hear but why in the world would you go to a Trump rally during a pandemic?
This is on TRUMP and conservatives that deny the science of COVID
Collins is the perfect example for term restrictions. She is Trump's bit*h, which makes her Putin's bit*h. She stopped working for Maine/America long ago.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
What’s hysterical is Trump’s reverse psychology. He is no dummy. I’ve said this for 4 years. He creates a little stir on Twitter to make all the yahoos go crazy, get them off his back, &amp; tackles real policies. For every little fire he creates, he gets 4 great things done.
Herman Cain layed down with dogs (Unmasked Trump rally) and he got fleas (Coronavirus).  Don't go to huge gatherings. Wear a mask. Learn from the stupidity of people like Herman and Gohmert.
Dear internet. Donald Trump just said something really stupid to distract us from the fact that 2nd quarter economic reports are out. don't fall for his bs. this is the one  topic he polls strongest at.
Then you know Trump and many in the GOP also have close ties to Epstein. Again, you’re speaking as someone who is partisan and biased.
Here comes the barrage of tweets telling us not to remember where Herman Cain likely caught the coronavirus that killed him: the Trump Tulsa rally
If they think I'm going to listen to this Witch Doctor over Covid-19      THEY CRAZY AS HELL!!! Is this the best you can come up Trump? SERIOUSLY?  Come on November💯❤
I guess when I’m referring to “traditional conservatives,” I’m thinking of recent conversations I’ve had with my dad. He supported Trump early on, but when I’ve had a chance to talk more carefully with him, the layers peel back and there’s a ton he doesn’t like about him.
*Herman Cain contracts Coronavirus at Trump rally in Tulsa*   Meanwhile, at that same rally:
You are beyond embarrassing Donald Trump, your spin of conspiracy theories and creation of fear and division is outrageous and a demonstration of your own insecurities. You are so inept and weak.
This man Brandon replied to a trump tweet they are absolutely on his ass
Every Trump supporter that didn’t want to take any precautionary measures for Covid, let’s chat.
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
President Trump floats idea of delaying the November election
Sad to hear of any life lost in this Pandemic even if it is that of a Republican rival.  But this ties directly to Trump rally in Tulsa with direct cause and effect connection. Should be a cautionary tale to anyone who have been bending over backwards for Trump!
AND ... Congress remains at a stalemate about continuing the $600 weekly federal unemployment supplement that ends tomorrow. It was approved as part of pandemic relief.
Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that
End Donald Trump. Permanently.
These stats are why he said it. Trump has no authority to change election date.
Donald Trump is seriously calling someone out for not doing their job. He's an idiot!!
Me responding to trump⬇️:
Trump has no authority, absolutely ZERO authority to delay election. Although, it is startling that he would if could delay elections for Covid saftey reason, but insists students, teachers and staff go back to school. Tge man is a walking talking oxymoron. I meant moron!
Well, Seeing that Trump himself has been pushing its development, I’m sure I would get one in the future.   But again, it would depend on where it come from; I would be wary if it comes from Bill Gates or China.
Trump floats November election delay - but he can’t do that #SmartNews
Never take anything Trump says seriously? Got it.
Trump Floats Delaying The Election. It Would Require A Change In Law
Loud and wrong  Suspend yourself from writing garbage opinion pieces. Trump has no rock bottom and it’s sad you haven’t learned that in 3 years now.
Any average person (ESPECIALLY black person) that thinks any politician has their best interest in mind, is insane. Trump, Biden, Obama, Clinton, Bush, all the way back to George Washington. All of them were flaming psychopaths
I just did the math. If 1% of people who voted for trump in 2016 in MI, PA &amp; WI switch their votes to Biden (and all other states would remain the same) Biden would win the presidency.
It’s astonishing to me how he can say these things yet 40%+ of people still support. I feel the discourse he is causing and the seeds of doubt in our democracy he has planted won’t just disappear once he does. Trump I believe has damaged our way of thinking so much
This is quite possibly the dumbest, most willfully ignorant column I've ever read. It comes from the New York Times, which should be no surprise to anyone.
Trump is not delaying the election. After 4 years of following him. He says stuff to bring awareness because just saying voter fraud doesn’t get folks attention. Him saying I’m going to delay, raises exponential awareness across the world. I.e. the reason why folks are talking
"DELAY THE ELECTION":  proposed that the US could "delay the election" saying that voting by mail would be "inaccurate" and "fraudulent." #Election2020
One important thing to realize about Trump's supporters is that they don't give a shit about democracy, the right to vote, or any of our rights under the Constitution. They just care about having their guy in power. And racism.
Trump can’t delay the election, experts say
You are so right. Fuck Trump 🤬
“The Constitution really has been a workable document in many respects because we have had people who more or less adhered to a code of conduct...”  45 doesn’t care about traditions or norms or a code of conduct. That is going to be a huge problem.
A Closer Look at Melania Trump’s Latest Cause: A Makeover of the White House Rose Garden
that is truly sad. Trump is a bigot and if you sitting here on Twitter telling me you fw a shawty who fw that nigga you trippin. Trump has gotten white people way more comfortable spewing hate and that’s not something I would ever just ignore.
So Mr. Bolton, what can/will you do about it? You threw U.S. under bus, knowing how dangerous &amp; incompetent Trump was &amp; not speaking up when your country needed you.
Even if Trump were able to disrupt the November election, he's still Constitutionally-bound to leave office.  If the election hasn't been decided, then Nancy Pelosi becomes POTUS at noon on January 20, 2021.
#areyoubetteroff Trump has approved discord
Desperate Donald Trump thinks it’s safe to open the economy and schools without restrictions, but wants to delay the election, due to Covid-19? Ok! Maybe the Demon Sperm Lady can cast a spell to help him with those low poll numbers 🙄
Trump has encouraged divisiveness
I want to first say that Donald Trump is the most dangerous PUNK I have ever seen in my life. From the seat of the President, he is fear mongering and trying to manipulate an election because he is simply a cowardly PUNK! Americans who support the weakness of this incompetent
Unbelievable anyone would pay for any of this! Ewww. More believable: people pay Trump to go far far away.
Not only is this dumb, but also unconstitutional. Only the states and Congress have the ability to change general elections. It’s sad how on the day an American hero is being laid to rest, that Trump tweets this undemocratic stuff.
They going to get them all. Trump, William Bar, Stone(maybe) and several others will be in handcuffs in January. It's almost a sure thing Trump will finally get his walls. I can't wait 😂
I saw #presidentpelosi was trending and looked for next headline “Pence - Trump murder suicide pact” but nothing that good could be real.
Trump isn’t welcome. Let the true leaders speak.
You are the biggest threat to this country because we know you will do ANYTHING to get a job. We know you will sell out this country faster than Joe Biden because to you power is a drug. But we don't need addicted people running our great country. TRUMP 2020! MAGA!#NOTOSocialism
That sounds like Trump's pandemic response.
Huh, maybe #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K and police brutality matters more than the trump attempts to smear a political opponent. And newsflash sweetie, you're the last one who should be throwing stones over nepotism.
So I guess COVID-19 is one way to increase the home therapies goal outlined in the Honorable President Trump's EO of July 2019.
Trump was saying this same bs in 2016. After the election we never heard another peep.

Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Why does ever single person in Trump’s tradgi-comedy have a name straight our of an Elmore Leonard novel, starting with his own? Tommy Tuberville. Bill Barr. Rodger Stone. Sean Spicer. Reality Winner. “Mad Dog” Mattis. Kayleigh McEnany (rhymes with ninny). It’s ridiculous.
Absentee voting IS mail-in-voting. Trump thinks we are stupid, prove him wrong.
Y’all freaking out about trump saying we can’t vote by mail—you didn’t see this coming? Do you have no imagination? That’s a big problem.
Trump is a Putin puppet. Trump thinks we are stupid.  VOTE Biden for our national security.
I pray that every night. My first words in the morning are, is trump still around? Followed by, good morning.
I told a dozen people yesterday...HCQ and Trump...I called it...and here it is...
Politics in this day and age is not something you can get over tho. Your core values reflect what you stand for and if we don’t stand for the same thing and nothing for us to build together. If shawty tell you she fw Trump you still sliding?
panicked at the tweet. They won't delay even 1 day. They want Trump out.
Lol  Reread your comment again and tell me that these comments from Trump are not trying to divide and conquer America.  As a country I do not know if we can survive another 4 years of Trump.
Have YOU ever been able to vote for a poor man for President of this country? It's not even about party. It's about voting for a man who gets things done in spite of a party. In spite of 2 parties!Trump is. We had a virus. We're coming back! TRUMP 2020.Bernies not poor! He's rich
Idk seeing how religious people treat accept trump and hate immigrants reinforces why not to be involved with organized religion
Trump floats delaying election despite not having authority to do so.
Yes! Stay fit (or swole for dudes) for Papa Trump 😂💯
Trump.... his arrogant ignorance to Science, his own self interests and his a lack of a National Response/Plan has catapulted #COVID19 to  the leading cause of death in America!! #TrumpLiesAmericansDie
Trump is so scared to not be in the office. He knows all these allegations that have been on him the past few years will definitely come to light once he isn’t president anymore. Tax returns, emails, sexual assault, pedophilia, list is long Orange man!
President Donald Trump proposed delaying the election in a tweet on Thursday, but only Congress has the authority to delay the election.
Since COVID is such a health risk and we can’t trust mail-in voting, Trump should sign an EO delaying the vote until COVID is gone. Bet it would be gone within days.
Trump talking delaying election. Here we go.
No one is cheering these numbers because they want Trump to fail. These numbers mean millions of real people will struggle to not only make ends meet but to survive. We just want someone who recognizes that addressing the pandemic IS saving the economy.
The danger lay not with POTUS or Congress, but with the states, where legislatures and governors sympathetic to Trump can tinker with the means by which the states select their electors. That’s who we should be watching.
Trump is going to pull any and every move he can to delay this election. He’s fighting for extra time, and thinks NOW because of Covid, he can use that to his benefit. Let me tell you this, I will come out in a hazmat suit if needed to vote dude out of office... KNOW THIS.
You had a chance to stand up to orange bully and you wouldn’t do a thing. You and the GOP are to blame for EVERYTHING that Trump has done to tank this country just like he ranked every business he has ever owned. You will be gone in 90 days.
They do. Barr, Miller, and his long time staff 100% know that. Trump may be dumb but his senior staff isn't. They're very smart and very dangerous.
I’m really enjoying Trump’s new somber and disciplined tone.
Honestly, I feel like Donald Trump pushed good policies. He could’ve approached it in a better manner, but overall, 👏🏽
Judge Napolitano is no more than a self-enriching anti Trump Liberal Fox employee who thrives on his own self-importance.

Hey Aunt Pittypat,  how do you feel about Trump's suggestion to delay the election? Are you going to take a legal stand? Oh, yeah, I forgot it's you.
Hey didn’t you write an op-Ed about how Biden was crazy for suggesting Trump was going to try and delay the election?  How’s that one working out?
This is simply untrue, illegal, tyrannical, in other words typical Trump. There. is no basis for delay. We can not allow the process to be undermined by lies. #WeThePeople can not accept this. Leaders of BOTH parties need to take a stand!
In this column, Olsen said trying to delay the election would be treason. What you wanna bet he now believes that's a perfectly reasonable thing for Trump to do.
And I'm sure the Trump administration knows this but if there is no election, his presidency ends in January.
If Donald Trump makes any attempt to delay the 2020 Election, not only would he be violating the law, he would be showing the American People just how truly unlawful he is...and if  doesn't hold him accountable, they will be complicit in the most unpatriotic way.
The Fuhrer Forrest Trump wants to delay the election until polls showing him beating Joe Biden. That won't work because that will never happen.
Of course, he is... Wannabe Dictator Trump is desperate to stay in there as long as he can, because he knows the minute he is voted out, he will be arrested.
Desperate Trump floats idea of delaying the November election.   I hope someone has a plan to deal with the level of chaos and insanity that the he and Putin have planned for November, because it’s obvious he’s not leaving voluntarily.
Trump wants to open schools but delay the election...
Report Trump's tweets to Twitter.  There is a specific reporting category for disinformation about this election.
Mr. Trump, these motherfucking Caucasians have came and gentrified these comfortably affordable housing neighborhoods in Charlotte North Carolina and elsewhere and ran them out into more unsavory areas with bad schools and lower quality of life. You are a trash president. 💯
Fact Check: Although Trump says that Absentee Voting "is good", the only Congressional election that was not certified due to voter fraud in 2018 was due to illegal vote harvesting of ABSENTEE ballots by a REPUBLICAN operative in NC's 9th District.
Anyone still believe Donald Trump is not attempting to dismantle our democracy? We can't let him. This isn't a democratic battle or a progressive battle or a "leftist" battle. This is an American battle. I won't apologize for being dramatic.
NEW: Trump suggests delaying 2020 election although he has no authority to make that decision. Only congress can change the date for the general election for president

I doubt it tho knowing Trump they’d just send in the military to calm things down. Whole country would go to ruin if that happened which also isn’t what we want
Hosers 4 trump?
Trump's behavior is a slap in the face of the fight for equity + equality in this country. He doesn't care about REAL solutions towards ACTUALLY "making America great again", because what he tweeted - and what he does (doesn't do) for betterment of society - achieves the opposite
Anyone surprised?

Nope.
Skeptical for two reasons:  1) The telling of James Comey’s complex role in this moment of history really shouldn’t be based on his self-aggrandizing memoir  2) Trump can’t be played as anything but a cartoon, even with Gleeson’s great talent
FFS Trump literally ended the statement with a QUESTION MARK. It’s not like he can delay it anyway.  Stop taking the bait and mouth breathing over everything.

Trump suggests delaying 2020 election over unfounded claims mail-in voting will be 'fraudulent'
A proper reaction could not have avoided a fundamental re-wiring of economic activity as we adapted behavior either organically or via policy. Pretending that's on Trump is just silly and a waste of breath. Blame him for stuff he actually does wrong, like cutting UI.

I know darn well if the kids can go to school in the next month - We can vote on Nov 3rd and will vote Trump corrupt butt OUT ...

Trump just suggested delaying the election 🤦‍♂️
The left are good at that. He shows in his response to me that he doesn't care about a very low cost medicine that can help save lives because it doesn't fall under the narrative the left are trying to paint. Anything to hurt Trump no matter who else suffers
You are right. You can't make up just how bad and misleading the media is towards our President. It is sad that they would rather try to make Trump look bad than save lives.
Because if it looks tight people will vote, if they think it's a foregone conclusion they"ll stay home, and that is how Trump gets a second term to continue fucking up the country. Besides Early Voting starts in some states in just over a month.
How do you know Trump doesn't have CV19?
Unless you want to have a civil war over government control then no Trump couldn’t mandate mask nationwide. If Biden thought his audience were against wearing a mask then roles would be reversed and Trump would be wearing a mask that’s how it is. That is how this game works.
Bullshit American hasn't heard anything bad that Obama did vs.the shit trump doing and you think Obama was corrupt trump full of corruption
Voting in November for Trump and major voting to get the leftist extremes who want to defund the police and burn down America out
Indeed. 6 Weeks to go to Early Voting! Stay vigilant, and don't get complacent. Pretend we're 20 points down. This must be such an overwhelming defeat that Trump supporters are throwing themselves off bridges &amp; Infront of trains in their despair.

I would watch the Devil Crats hearing . But I don’t have enough blood pressure medication. So all i can say about this fiasco is GO Trump. Wished I could vote early and often like Chicago does.
All countries have it and listened to the same BS that China and WHO put out at the beginning. Trump is not responsible for any of it and especially world wide. misdirected from the start. He started closing air travel 10 days after it was finally announced. Dems tried stop him.
I am registered Dem but I have voted for Repubs. I'm not and never will be a straight party voter. I weigh each candidate and chose my vote for the one I think is best suited for the job, not what party they are in. So yes I would. But a tRump supporter no, with a capital HELL NO
PRESIDENT TRUMP PLEASE MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO KEEP HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE FROM US!!!! #HDQCures
I mean they assume he is Trump’s lacky but from what I am hearing it sure doesn’t sound like it. I mean yeah its never good to rat out the boss in any situation but he seems to be doing his job and honestly answering questions to his own true convictions.
Isn’t it ironic that the  biggest complaint on Obama was the debt and golf? Ya know, since Trump is worse on both fronts.   #TrumpleThinSkin

Cities in Bind as Turmoil Spreads Far Beyond Portland
You have to be a moron to think that. The media overseas may mock trump but polls showed people respected America more under Trump than Obama. Under Obama Americas standing went down and chinas, Iran, North Korea and Russia’s went up. Under Trump America has went up
Funny how all these liberals act like they  conservatives against Trump and are voting Biden when everyone in these comments are far left.
So why would a Reagan conservative vote for Biden over Trump when Trump is more conservative and has done more conservative things for this nation than Bush and also Biden and democrats stand for everything Reagan was against?
Your a liberal so how would you know anything about Conservatives, Reagan or Trump?
China isn't with Trump shit at all
Do you have any proof of this? Maybe some studies or something?  Here's a hint. Trump had his own investigation done on this subject. They found nothing from the last election.  Hell, if voting by mail is compromised then we have a lot to rethink. No taxes by mail etc...

Hopefully this is true. It will be good, for everyone. But if Trump cuts Medicare the people are still in desperate need of medical care and prescriptions.
Feel at ease that we have rid our nation of Trump.
So you're gonna be satisfied to say something went wrong when your daughter is killed by the police who are well trained and have body armour? Something went wrong when Trump got into office, that can be fixed. Someone's life can not be brought back. Live by your own lack of care
Fraudulent mail-in voting is rare, and no more of a problem than in person voting. If mail-voting voting was a problem, why has Trump himself voted by mail?  He is just preparing an excuse for his potential loss in the Fall, because he never takes accountability for his failures.
Coronavirus relief package could lead to Social Security and Medicare cuts | The Independent
Trump is not the problem. You can get rid of *him*, but the system behind him, backing him, supporting him, doesn't go away. The *system* is the problem. And the system is made out of parts from both sides. Honestly, I don't see an option that stays inside that system working.
Talk to the children charities that his family pillaged. His fraudulent foundation. Trump University,  the children being held in cages at the border. The peaceful demonstration he gassed for a photo op. Prince of a guy.
You're gonna tell me Biden's people are going to help ordinary folks? That he'll sign off on M4A, for example? Trump's a symptom, not the cause. It's a systemic problem.

That is Trump for you! A tyrant
Yeah because he had a Republican House and Senate. They wouldn’t let him do nothing. You need to look at the whole picture not just a part of the picture. At least we were better off with Obama than we are with a Trump! Trump is putting all his crooked friends back on the streets
True, but I hope Trump will be gone. With having to choose between Trump and Biden. Trump is out definitely. It is Biden for President. But Biden is at least a American and not a commie. I wish we had another choice. Things would have been different if Trump got impeached!
And as a working man, how can you back Trump and all his lies and cons? You call yourself an American? Trump will take everything you have ever worked for and trash it. If you can’t see the ignorant tyrant he is then you are ignorant!
Please don’t get brainwashed by Trump and his cronies. I am not saying that our country was perfect, but we were not communist under a dictator like Trump wants America to be. We must fight Trump and his cronies!
Trump
That is Trump! Not Obama! Get you facts straight! Trump spent more on the wall and all his personal trips than any other President in the history of our country! So get your facts straight!
Because you cheated and used Russia and any other country to interfere with our voting! Trump you are a back stabbing tyrant that is a total disgrace
I agree. Trump has no allegiance to our country! He only has allegiance to people who can make him rich and follows his orders! He is a tyrant commie!
Not true! You are mistaken! It is Trump that is helping himself and his buddies to further his wealth, even if he cheats, lies, and trades our freedom for his dirty deeds! Trump is a traitor and a con and has always been a traitor!
That is exactly what Trump is trying to do! We must stop Trump and trump should be ousted now!
Trump?
Millions of voters saw Trump's misleading #Facebook ads about voting by mail. I don't trust Zuckerberg to fix this, he makes too much money from those ads. Congress and federal regulators must investigate and act.
Better than Trump!
American people do something to get rid of Trump! Make sure everyone votes the tyrant Trump out now! Immediately!
Yes not only is the Republicans allowing him to be a traitor, so is the Democrats! The Democrats can do a lot more to oust Trump from office!
Exactly. They have been too easy on Trump. He needs strict strong justice! He should pay for all the wrong and pain and suffering he has done to our nation and it’s people. He totally let our country down. He is not only a failure for our country, but he is not a true American!
That is why Trump should have been impeached. He is the biggest traitor to our country and is a tyrant and a fraud. In fact his whole family are frauds that don’t belong in our democracy and government!
Get Trump out! Really it is a wonder why no one has tried to assassin Trump?

Trump is a threat and NONE of the Democrats attempts to bring him down have worked so now they are trying to use the Coronavirus to keep from having any Presidential debates because they KNOW Joe Biden is not coherent. It will not work. Trump will win in a landslide.
Oh please, I get the message along with just about everyone in America.  Trump is making it about him by invoking his new campaign slogan-Law and Order. Go ahead, protest 24/7. See what it gets you. Hope you don’t catch coronavirus.
I understand and see your point. I had not thought about it that way. Now it has become an us vs. them standoff and the protest message is becoming lost. The longer it goes on, the more Trump will dig in and it will be more about HIM than the important message from protestors.
All these black burning,looting and terrorizing ppl are nothing but bottom feeding scum and should be delt with. I hope Trump sends in the feds to take over. BLM IS THRASH
That is true. I watched horrified how the police treated protestors. Odd they didn’t crack down on the looters like they did the peaceful protestors. Nevertheless, I am talking about now and the escalating need NOT to feed Trump’s narrative. Protestors have made their point.

Obama and Biden are doing no such thing. This president is dishonest. People around him were actually found guilty of crimes. Evidently you had no problem with Trump saying Obama was not a citizen FOR YEARS, trying to unseat an elected prez. Go sit down.♥️
Great, and mildly re-assuring post from John. However, Trump will never, ever resign. His ego won’t allow it and his sunk costs are too high not to mention criminal prosecution awaits him once he leaves office. Nope, he’s in until the end. Whenever that ends up being.
The best thing is that trump’s anti mask stand infected his followers, and now they can’t back down. They are causing the very situation that is tanking trumps re-election chances! It’s so ironic, it’s freakin poetic justice. You anti maskers might as well be working for Biden 😂

My read of GWB is that whether or not he was smarter than Trump, he certainly had far more respect &amp; understanding the integrity of the Presidential office. Even to it's limits to some extent. Mostly due to his father having served as President beforehand.

Mr. Olsen, will you apologize to  now that Trump has actually done what you said would never happen and suggested delaying the election? It clearly isn’t “over the line” as you said back in April.
It’s really folks that look like me defending trump and it makes me sick
No. Nope. Negative.  Absolutely not.
The US Constitution states that his term is up in January. Delaying an election doesn’t change that. Speaker of the House is next in line. So trump wants President Pelosi to happen?
Too bad you don’t have the authority to do it. November is gonna be ugly. We need to be prepared that we won’t know who won for a while. AG Barr admitted under oath that they have no proof of voter fraud. Trump is setting the table to contest the results.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
"Trump Suggests Delaying November U.S. Presidential Election" by Reuters via NYT
I used to think Republicans in Congress sided with Trump not because they were racists but because they feared losing their jobs.  It is now clear that many of them do share Trump’s views about people of color and that America should be a country ruled by white Christians.
Someone please inform 46-1 that "Trump has no authority to delay an election, and the Constitution gives Congress the power to set the date for voting."
Haley talks to him like she would one of her kids.  But it’s trump so she needs to dumb it down even more.
Think I’m joking or don’t know what I’m talking about? Think again.   In a new poll, half of Republicans say they would support postponing the 2020 election if Trump proposed it
When Republicans fall in line and support Trump’s idea to delay the election (let’s be real, they WILL support it if for nothing else than to give RBG more time to die &amp; be replaced) you’ll be kicking yourself for thinking Trump didn’t have the authority to move the date.
You should hide Trump.♥️

That’s a lame argument. Nice attempt at laying all the ‘COVID deaths’ at Trumps feet. Typical lefty deflection. Rice is a proven hack and Pence will mop the floor with anyone that Biden..errr the DNC picks as VP, just as Trump will demolish Sloe Biden in the debates.

He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race, self-deception and anger that now dominate it. Hold Donald Trump up to a mirror and that bulging, scowling orange face is today’s Republican Party.”
I spent decades working to elect Republicans, including Mr. Romney and four other presidential candidates, and I am here to bear reluctant witness that Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party.
“Then Donald Trump emerged and the party threw all those conclusions out the window with an almost audible sigh of relief: Thank God we can win without pretending we really care about this stuff. That reaction was sadly predictable....

fo rand, you know the feds inept response lead to this. Cuomo went by fed standards, trump standards if you will. the fed has been a total failure and left it up to states to handle this. now look at it. rampaging again and will keep on. trump is useless.
I will never understand the argument that says that because some Hong Kong protesters appealed to Trump, the entire movement is invalid.

"How Local Covid Deaths Are Affecting Vote Choice" by Lynn Vavreck and Christopher Warshaw via NYT
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter removed a COVID-19 video tweeted by Trump due to false coronavirus information — but millions had already viewed it
Trump has done an incredible job turning this into his advantage - most Dems aren’t saying anything because we came out to defend these “peaceful protesters,” only to have them escalate things to the point we’re at now. I can’t believe we’ve reached this point
If Biden doesn’t renounce these people, I may cast my vote for Trump - I think he’s actually afraid to do it...

The #federal penalty for #manslaughter can be eight years. 150,000 #Americans died from #COVID19 as of today. #Trump should be in #prison for the next 1.2 million years.
I will not be comfortable until our next President has secured their place in the Oval Office and Trump is doing the perp walk on TV.
Because Trump suggested it! Their ALL losers.
The tragedy is that they won't be able to charge him with the contempt he'll be showing. He knows he and Trump are running this country by their own rules now, and he will show open scorn toward Dem's questions.
Now, are you talking about Trump ordered murders by private military contractors? #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpGestapo
i just hate how trump talk like bitch fix yo lips
Why? Because ALL Republicans are for sale. Every. Last. One.
Trump, you can go straight through to hell with racist motto!
Trump is ridiculous! He has proven to be a racist, enhanced divisiveness, has a corrupt presidency, he has caused nothing but mayhem as he uses his position to line his pockets. All of this and yet he still wonders why Americans are against him
You know,Dear, this Trump Cruiseline is really romantic. He set Fauci free alright....pretty good swimmer. He almost made it! Another bottle of Beaujaripple?
It is not their hatred of Trump as you keep saying. Wake up, it is their total quest for POWER. Destroy the country and regain POWER. Don't be a fool!!!

Why does this look like Kanye and a girl Trump
Dear, the corona virus only started dec2019. Use on all those other disease is of some value. That’s the only reason Trump came up with it. But medical scientists tested it in people and found not helpful for this virus!
And I’m a PA since 1996 and I can tell you NO DOCTOR would withhold lifesaving treatment.and definitely not going to get a country full of dr.’s to withhold treatment over Trump. Ridiculous! 🦋💙
You are staying facts? The racists have exposed themselves. Trump has defended history, he has openly called out white supremacists as evil. To top it off Biden is the one who said thinking of vote for trump means you aren't black. Please show me any verse that says He's black.
Bruhhhhh j was like why she look like trump and he look like Kanye 🤣🤣🤣
Trump says America will defeat COVID-19 ‘in record time’ during visit to Triangle biotech company
You would likely have gotten well anyway. If you had cancer, would you believe the Trump’s over your doctor or this unverified lady, from another country no less, where we can’t even verify one of her claims. It’s really ridiculous. You would never seek medical advice from DJT
Trump had two key policy focuses when he first ran for president: 1. Crack down on illegal immigration, and 2. Don’t be overly reliant on trade from other countries.  With what all we see going on with China, he’s been more than vindicated on No. 2.

They had a sixteen year plan to destroy America. We were saved when Trump won the election.
Trump will win with a landslide this time.
Trump just loves those walls....
I don't think "responsible intellectually honest conservatives" exist. If they did they'd have been so outraged by Trump's candidacy that they'd have voted Dem in 2016 &amp; crushed Trump with a humiliating defeat. They were fine sitting the election out tho. That's not responsible.
Trump supports will care until he says the cost is not a big deal.
Trump supporters more enthusiastic than Biden's: poll
trump knew this would be the reaction when he did this. a few bad apples is what he is counting on to make his ads. and knowing trump, he planted those apples. never put anything past him that's nefarious.
I don’t think revisiting the last 40+ years is the approach to make Biden look better than Trump...it makes them both look like shit and the DNC and RNC out of touch with reality. Seriously...2 white men in their last 70’s are my only legitimate choices?

Seems proper to me that Ryan would refrain from commenting, being a board member and all. Maybe WaPo doesn't have the "leftist agenda" you and Trump imagine. Maybe you've made it up to undermine WaPo's factual reporting.
I think our foundational disagreement is on the notion that the protesters protesting, and the cops rioting in return (because that's what's happening) is the kind of thing that Trump can turn into effective propaganda and that the left can't also use to motivate a base.

He was spreading trump’s stupidity and he put trump over his own life likely infected others. He got what he asked for and I don’t feel a bit sorry about this news. I am done with all these stupid people.
Trump has exposed gaps in our government to manage and contain the powers of one person

It's funny how everyone that didn't vote for  knew he would tank as POTUS and look what we have here: Trump tanking as POTUS.  The MAGA pool is getting smaller and smaller everyday through CV deaths and awakenings. Trump is a fraud.
Biden in April: Trump will try and delay the election. GOP/Trump fans: Biden is being hysterical. Trump today: We should delay the election.
Also Trump will need to be asking Pelosi permission to do this since only Congress can change election day.  That should be fun.
In 2016, I knew this man would never abdicate the throne.  I felt certain he would need to be forcibly removed.   He will.   Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
The Trump Campaign will do everything in its power to steal the election. If this statement isn't considered a certainty, we're in serious trouble. Trump has never done anything that would indicate a different scenario for the next 100 days.

That's exactly what he said last year. No matter what, there was nothing he could when Trump was just carpetbombing the state.
Prepare... Trump. Flags. Everywhere.  😖😖😖
I’m more anti-Trump than I am anti-Biden. Maybe one year we can nominate someone that doesn’t make me hold my nose. Maybe a guy like Andrew Yang...
It's worth reading. Trump's been trying to be his father for a while—mean, ruthless, feared, powerful. He even paints his face to resemble his father's complexion. DT loved his despotic dad and can't figure out why people don't love him when he acts the same way. It's scary/sad.
Have you heard Trump make fun of women and disabled people???
There was talk of him running in 2012 (mostly from Trump himself).
Hey Madonna. Now you see what we see right? Still in time for you to #WalkAwayFromDemocrats  You will now see each one of your "friends" discarding you simply for suggesting there is a cure for Covid19.  Vote for Trump &amp; stop supporting killing babies.
What time will Trump be making his eloquent speech?  🤷🏾‍♂️😂
Let’s see....Who do I believe here? Trump’s waterboy or the retired Federal judge w/ the law degree? Not a tough call.
Big tech won’t need to do shit. This dictatorship is over in November. Then it’s open fucking season on the Trump family.

The Post Office was AMAZING before Trump. I mean sure, there were the mass shootings that were so common that Going Postal was a thing. There was the riseof 3 major alternatives to ship packages in a timely and reliable manner. But yeah, Trump.
Mitt, is Ultra Beta. Despite all the external traits that would indicate Alpha he still lacks all courage. He is the opposite of resolute. I'd bet money his opposition to Trump is his wife hectoring him to do so or he will look weak, which again, not alpha. Maybe alfa.
Trump is withdrawing troops from our allies which could cost us billions....where will the money come from
We spent millions buying them from trump-cronies and now that its not the answer we’re stuck. Maybe they can be used as suppositories. How many do you think will fit up all their asses?
I happened by the school this afternoon and flipped off all the trump/pence supporters standing outside the school.   They were very easy to identify.  No masks. 🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽

Why did it take the inhumane human, who was fined for housing discrimination by placing Cs on black people's rental applications, so long to reverse this? #RacistInChief
I would like to see a comparison of Sundays where Trump golfed vs went to Church.
Aaaaaah, there you are Beer Bro.
Can he get any more racist and blatant than this? I'm wondering where he hides his white hood because his tweets make his intention crystal clear. He better rethink things going forward if he believes that this kind of messaging will draw new voters to his church of trump.
Like..... this tweet is so despicable that I can't even think of a witty response to "Suburban Lifestyle Dream." Trump just broke my brain.
Anyone can be anything.  He ain't lying.  Proof?  Donald Trump became President.
They don’t give a shit.. Only thing they want is POTUS TRUMP OUT... Can’t wait to see the meltdown when he wins on Nov3 #Trump2020LetsSaveAmerica
Bro these people never read n think they just read the headlines 🤦🏼‍♂️. Miserable ass people hate on trump just cus they can
If you need incontrovertible proof that the Trump family are morons and America is doomed, read this:
My husband a NG veteran who served 30 years deserves respect. But Cooper assumes that Trump supporters &amp; Reopen NC are Covid19 transmitters &amp; grandma killers. People social distancing in one of the Reopen NC rally.
The claim has been that Trump brought violence. When it doesn't abate... I like winning wars not battles and this is a war and is much bigger than one courthouse in Portland. If all of Portland burned, I wouldn't care at all. They got what they planted,fertilized and harvested.
It is reasonable to say: "Whoever gets the most total votes should be POTUS" (I prefer the electoral collage even though it clearly hurts my party)   It's not reasonable to say: "If this election is free and this election is fair, Trump will get four more years"
Stop avoiding the fact Trump is a crook and they allow him to do it on from the White House on TV. Start with that Republicans are weak and trying to keep a job just look at them switching now
Why does Trump always sit like he's on the toilet?
You're right.  You de-Trump the GOP by chasing outs its Trump stooges like
Take Trump out of your thinking for a moment and ask yourself why we’re not widely using a safe drug that could save tens of thousands of lives and allow our our schools to reopen and help the economy to start recovery.
The unmasking issue appears to be part of an effort by the president and his allies to tar former president Barack Obama with what Trump says was an unfounded criminal investigation into potential conspiracy between Russia and Trump associates -

‘Nobody Likes Me,’ Trump Complains, Renewing Defense of Dubious Science
Went to a local establishment last night and the service was so poor...dang Trump!
The administration has chosen to flout a decision by the Supreme Court, effectively rejecting the judiciary’s authority to say what the law is.
And why didn’t our Crooked Fake President Trump do this 6 months ago when this crap started? 6 months == 150,000 dead
Psss. He meant for politically driven process crimes used to punish people for supporting Trump. Now if he was killing people too, then yeah. For sure.
This doesn't surprise me. If it weren't for reputable &amp; tenacious journalists, we might never know the truth or what goes on in the trump White House. When Trump &amp; Barr have their mouths open, we know for sure they're flat out lying about everything. Barr needs to be taken down.
I was also thinking that or repubs / trump are being promised a big piece of that big pharma pie. Wouldn't surprise me one bit.
Just like it's rich for YOU to even bring it up, don't you think? Most times w/ you, I don't know who's speaking. The 2016 Lindsey who DESPISED Trump &amp; told us the U.S. would go to hell if he became president or the 2020's present day lapdog Lindsey who loves to kiss Trump's ass?
Which is worse: Trump promoting fake cures, or Trump knowing about a cure but not distributing it to the nation??
Don’t forget that Biden took questions from reporters for 30 minutes today while Trump has hardly faced any questions that weren’t screened in recent months without petulantly storming out of the room.
In case you're still wondering whether or not Trump solicited or accepted foreign assistance in 2016...
&amp;  Brian Williams just said Trump hit the reset button going back to his stance in March &amp; April. Quit telling he “reset or changed his tone or pivoted.” Trump NEVER changes who he is. If only the MSM would get &amp; state that.
The Trump crop top reveal really ties the whole thing together
After watching Bill Barr's "act" today, I can finally say there's one person in this admin that I hate as much as Trump.   It's one thing to deal w/ Trump's ignorance &amp; unwillingness to learn but Barr absolutely KNOWS better &amp; he should NEVER be allowed to get away with this.
No. Should be far longer! Like anyone else who committed the same crime and was not covering for trump!
Just keep repeating out loud, Our elections are secure, trump is lying, he will lose if Dems come out and vote!
So you think a person who can’t complete a sentence is going to be better then trump 🤦‍♂️
Nailed it! Social justice and police reform and the protests magically go away...unlike the virus, the other adult problem trump refuses to take seriously.
No worries, won’t  tap that DC Pentagon rebuild or “the wall” money.  trump burns thru money like he is trying to hide it from someone.

POTUS left the press briefing because as usual, the naughty disrespectful kindergartens started yelling questions &amp; talking on top of each other.  Can we have elections tomorrow? White House press hate Trump. It's so annoying. 😑
I hope Biden has some great  names that he's thinking of for attorney general. I'd love to see Adam Schiff be offered the job. I was just so impressed w/ him after the trial. He proved what a masterful prosecutor he still is &amp; LOL, he knows where all of Trump's dead bodies are!😉
Twitter, Facebook Delete Viral Video Promoted By Trump On COVID-19 And Hydroxychloroquine
Yes, he did. Watching Barr, I thought that I couldn't hate anymore more than I already hate Trump but he came very close to being at the top of my list. I have no idea how that man's even allowed to still have a law licence. He's disgusting &amp; this whole mess is shameful.
They must think they are destined for trump’s 1%.
How in the world could anyone blame Obama for lack of preparation for COVID-19 when Trump had 3 of his 4 years in office to remedy any of those supposed issues? #maga #MAGA2020

Thank you Congresswoman for your impressive grilling of puppet AG Barr, a Trump sycophant.
Crooked Fake President Trump ( Israel now has a Corona Czar. You need to stop playing golf, which helps absolutely nobody, and appoint  a Corona Czar for the US. And then you need to shut up about the coronavirus and run the country.
Nah. Imma order Mary Trump’s book instead!
What a joke. Trump administration e/ees are persecuted at random whereas Obama’s minions were free to break the law any which way possible. Sell weapons to drug lords, send pallets of cash to Iran, free terrorists, deny 501(c)(3) to conservative orgs. Project much? Stop lying
Calling it the Trump Virus is almost as bad as Trump calling it the China Virus. When they go low We go high. Let’s just call it what it is Covid-19.  Dem4Biden
In a reverse, a lot of the men interviewed are voting for Biden while their wives vote for Trump.
I'm watching Barr testify. In the Trump admin, I never thought I'd come close to hating someone as much as I despise Trump. William Barr's now getting right up there on my list. He's Trump's protector. He should be impeached &amp; prosecuted. He's the scum at the bottom of the swamp.
If the Trump campaign is looking for votes here, they're looking in the wrong place.
OMG  is winning! Sleepy creepy  is losing and under investigation by Ukraine for his quid quo pro for $2B disappearing if the proaecutor going after his son was not fired. Stupid Q: What If Donald Trump does not leave?
While I am no fan of Trump in any regard, I do think there is more to it. There are competing definitions of racism - believing in racial divisions associated with intrinsic qualities vs. ignoring the impact of racism and declining to rectify it.   MAGA supporters subscribe to #1
The difference was Fauci was invited.  Plus, he wasn’t invited to the Task force briefing.  trump was either going to be shown up at the briefing or on the diamond.  The pitch itself DIDN’T EVEN MATTER!
My home county of Wake has received some attention from both of Trump and Pence but we're no swing county. Biden is certain to get at least 60% of the vote here.
this is happening in Trump's America....
BS. There is no way to know for sure if they are ANTIFA members, or a member of any group. It’s not like they wear name tags. BTW, when did opposing fascism become unfashionable Herr Trump?
Donald Trump Jr . got suspended for posting this video..
It may simply mean that more people vote for Biden than trump !
Biden may not been the “change maker” some on the left wanted (in Bernie it Warren), but surely you can see that he’s worlds better than 4 more years of Trump?!? One step at a time, people!!
I’ve noticed that Trump hasn’t used Keep America Great as a slogan in awhile and keeps harping on MAGA which means he’s failed to make America great again.
Oh fuck NO
why do trump supporters call themselves the silent majority but he literally lost the popular vote??? so um false
"I support Free Speech, as long as it's speech that supports me."  - Donald Trump, probably.What’s wrong?!😳😳

Anyway, Trump would have to give up his seat and  would become President.
is a criminal!He's been engaged in laundering money with Russia for a decade!Maybe everyone will look the other way.U won't b doing it because Trump's service!He had bone spurs when this nation needed men!The fact he's president ruined most the faith I have in the USA
we need to start thinking about November&amp;making sure to lean hard on ur state senator over Trump's crimes!This is a nation of laws! NO ONE is above that law! It's kind of the American way!That's y Trump keeps his lips on Putin's cheeks!That's who Trump laundered money with
Donald Trump, without a doubt, is by definition a fascist. Here are the 14 characteristics of fascist regimes. Almost every one of these applies to Trump.

hey stupid, put ur mask on and shut up. When Trumps taxes hit and we find out ur legally elected traitor owes Russia millions which would explain pulling troops from Germany&amp;many other gifts Trump's handed to his real boss then clowns like u need to b by his side
The Tanned Man Has a Green Monster: Dr. Fauci is now in danger of being lumped into Trump’s envelope of envy, the same place in which he has placed Barack Obama.

I choose Trump over Biden!

Thank you President Trump!  #Trump2020
u would have to be completely stupid or willingly looking the other way! As obvious as it is watching Trump acting like a lap dog around Putin! Only Putin knows the price we're about to pay for mixing politics in with national security decisions! Everything ends I guess?
until we see Trump's taxes we have to assume that he's in Putin's pocket!Especially after HELSINKI&amp;working tirelessly to shower Putin with praise! Who does that! Now the old Republican party is helping Trump,many x Republicans have walked back damning statements about Russia
the GOP is totally a Trump loyalist organization we must make the independent party the main 1!The old Republican party turned racist needs to be pushed way out on the fringes where we kept the racist for decades. Now that America knows the Republican party is the new kkk
u would have to be a total and complete moron to be scared by traitor Trump's authoritarian commercials! That's a commercial Putin would run. Saying the police puts u on hold for 17 min while ur trying to report a MURDER! Lol!I would rather b murdered than vote traitor Trump

the most important thing for justice in this country is getting biscuit boy away from the lead cop position and make sure Trump is prosecuted if he's guilty of any crimes before coming into office. It's not right that certain people get off! It's wrong!
Trump doesn't have the brains to realize he's being used up by hannity, Fox &amp; racist or Limbaugh. The respectful moral, real Republicans that built this party are distancing themselves from Trump, like the Reagan foundation, John McCain, &amp; other honest Republicans
maybe if a full and transparent investigation is completed by a neutral source and then at least Trump is tried for the decade of money laundering in Russia! Everyone knows that!He wasn't getting nothing from US Banks.His name was garbage! Worthless!4 bankruptcies

1 allegation against 20 allegations. Perhaps you might want to ask  who is suing Trump to get his DNA, and that Trump refuses to give it, even though it would exhonerate him if not guilty. And by the way, Biden is not running as the “Christian” candidate.

Dustin, was Trump born in America?
Trump has told more lies than anyone on this planet
Obama fueled hatred and not trump? Racists hated Obama's because hes black. Racists love trump because he aligns with their views. Every movement has it's time and the deaths of unarmed black men has made America's reexamine America's ugly in regard to glorifying racism
Anybody who is or is in the minority category, female (any), apart of the LGBTQIA+ community, has common sense, and or not racist better not fucking vote for Trump. Idgaf how much money he sends out, if he cared about his “legal” people, Americans shouldn’t be in a damn cage.

there's no way we can officially end the Trump presidency without a full investigation into everything they have done! These are some real criminals in traitor Trump's administration! Barr needs to have his affairs looked into as well.
so what if a reporter called Kayleigh a lying bi*ch! She is! Listen.. Anyone who goes to work for traitor Trump is gonna have to lie and risk criminal charges! Kayleigh knew this was a job about lying! Only gifted liars need apply! It's sickening.

Very sad state! I really never thought it was that bad, these people keep blaming Trump but he doesn't have a thing to do with the way the state's being ran. I don't agree with Trump all the time but I didn't agree with Obama but that's why we live in a Democracy!
Biden is horrible in my opinion... he is just like trump as well. The thing that makes trump more appealing is that he know what he’s doing most of the time... we don’t need a president who has stage 4 dementia.
It your fault. You and your Trump cult killed Herman Cain. You sir are guilty
And that's why you follow a whore mongering, lying, cheating, adulterous, monster as your leader. I come from a very Christian family and follow Jesus teachings more than all the Trump Christian cult members Look in a mirror. Oh, and I do support riots, that's how we came to be
I’m tired of you blind Biden supporters not listen to facts. How can anyone support a guy like Trump but liberal. Fact don’t care about you feelings bitch. We don’t need Trump or Biden. What makes you think Biden will do the things he’s been trying to do for 40+ years. (he won’t)
He gave the governors the job to weather they shut down or not. Most of the deaths are the governors fault. But tell me this... if Trump “botched” this like you think, then you can say Obama “botched” the swine flu.
Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That’s Unconstitutional.

Humor me for a bit, but let’s say  has a backlog of mail, piling up. To secure the mail at the facilities at night, Trump’s puppet hires private security (Erik prince goons) and that’s how ballots get lost.  Like it’s not far fetched at all, am I right?
Trump and Pence today committed an unforgivable sin when they refused to attend the Memorial Service of John Lewis. This will be remembered in history and on November 3!

SILVER ALERT: Donald Trump!
Sadly he could’ve prevented his own death but he wanted to not wear a mask at the trump rally
Translation: Donald Trump, President of the United States, isn’t doing his job. He must clear out, and in some cases arrest, the Dirty police &amp; Racist in America. If he can’t do it, the Citizens will do it for him. We will not be leaving until he is removed from office!
Y’all. . has died from #COVID19 — RIP. It’s sad that this virus that he didn’t take serious killed him 😩  Wake up y’all. Wear a mask. This man was at the Trump Rally in Oklahoma and refused to wear one
He was at a Trump rally in Oklahoma with no mask 😷 😬
I am voting for President Trump in November, representing the state of Florida.
Why would #MAGA put on masks?  consistent "no mask/no social distance" behavior trumps the false statements he makes about caring about those infected &amp; dying. #TrumpIsTheVirus #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #DumpTrump2SaveAmerica
Disgusting. The GOP &amp; Trump constantly talk about school choice when a better solution is making sure families of all income levels live in the same school district to ensure working class kids attend good schools without having kids travel long hours. #SuburbanitesAgainstTrump

Something notable about the ad: it includes the character critique of Trump within an economy-focused argument. Interesting to see the way Biden turns the populism against Trump &amp; his cabinet.
If you are a Trump Republican, then you actually really don’t care about: National security, balloooning debt, strengthening international relationships, morality... you care about party politics and sticking it to the dems. Sad but true.
It's July 29th and Trump still doesn't have a clue, let alone a national anything.   #WorstPresidentInHistory
No proof that he’s a white supremacist but ok... also you picture defines Biden to🤯🤯 people just rather protect him like people protect trump.
All because the media blew this virus out of proportion... the made people scared. The some states shut everything down and not enough money was going through the system. The shutdown bankrupt small businesses and people lost there jobs. That’s what happened, not Trump.

In an interview with a reporter, trump is put in a corner and repeatedly asked about Russia placing a bounty on American lives. Trump couldn't answer any of the questions. A consummated love affair of putin and trump?
Not at all😂😂😂 It’s all a hoax and trump sees it too. The smart ones aren’t fooled by covid lol
I hated the fact when Trump disrespected your father for being a WAR hero, not only to mention what he went through as a POW. I almost didn't vote for him for his remarks but I stayed the course. It must have been hard for you to speak the truth about Trump's niece, obviously $$$
By now if people don't know Putin will do anything to keep Trump in the White House, they haven't been paying attention.
Republican registrants joining our Republican party show guts knowing anti-government Marxist bullies may try intimidation. Trump supporters know Trump will fight to protect their Constitutional rights and won't  be silenced by a cultist mob.
They are there only to produce photo-ops. They are creating violence so Trump can run against the violence he created. #WorstPresidentEver

Before you start a war another or other country you’re not making it a great nation or country again you are destroying us from with in into the Republicans I am Employ you need to stand up to trump not let him make you look ridiculous that isWhat he has achieved.
And STOP saying China virus when you should have jumped on this pandemic earlier it could have saved many more lives. So it’s not China’s virus anymore it’s THE TRUMP VIRUS NOW.  No Trump the jigs is up  and you can’t blame no one but yourself.
This is good. I really thought Joe Mancin from W.V. would change parties b/c he’s such a good man. He made a clear statement that’s NOT happening. I don’t think he likes Trump, who saved his coal country. SIGH
One very selfish reason I hope Trump loses in November is that when I retire in 2024 I do not want his chicken scratch on any of my paperwork/certificates. Oh, and congratulations.
Why don’t y’all focus on winning in November? Democrats always sabotage themselves by not supporting the nominee. Y’all act like trump loosing is a forgone conclusion. One day  will be the nominee and she should be supported like Biden should be supported.
It’s not shameful. Biden won so it’s his platform. It’s shameful for y’all to not support Biden. Nothing matters if trump gets re-elected. The bigger picture is to get Democrats in control of the three branches of government. From there start building on a progressive platform.

Matter of opinion.  Perhaps it was what Trump said to the GOP (brace yourself), his leadership, that persuaded the rest of the GOP to adopt a new position.  Neither you nor I know how that sausage was made.
That moron and all leftists with their Anti-white ideology can't be reasoned with so don't even try. Trump is leaps and bounds better than demented old Joe who wants 2 destroy the very people that built this country and made it what it is. Vote for Joe is voting for White erasure

Testing doesn’t cause infections. It’s not because of tests that we have higher numbers. It’s because Trump didn’t do a damn thing and allowed the virus to spread. We need more tests to find out how widespread the virus is in the U.S. in order to implement procedures to control.
I don’t get the obsession with Kamala Harris attack on Biden. During the 2008 election Joe Biden refused to say Obama was qualified, yet he was selected as VP. Let’s focus on getting rid of Trump &amp; leave the primary politics behind.
I got the book. Haven’t read it yet. My mom is here visiting. She was like “what you doing with that book”? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Told her I bought it to piss Trump off so he can go ballistic. 🤣🤣. She then got one of the books I have written by a John Lewis tonread.
This election is an astoundingly clear referendum on the two views of America.  In Biden’s America, chaos, appeasement, corruption, open borders, socialism, higher taxes, a destroyed economy, big gov, &amp; a destroyed democracy.  Trump’s America is the opposite.  Choose well.

Not generalizing. If you are a trump supporter refusing to wear a mask and endangering Americans then I have no use for you. That's pretty specific if you ask me.
Because they are wishing death on all of us and who said I was tolerant. I hate Trump supporters with a passion. They are hell bent on destroying America.

Why is trump dragging right foot and shuffling around like a dotard or old man with Alzheimers?  There is a lack of motion in right arm to salute personnel no properly. Handicap railings on Air Force 1? Why is GOP pushing this teetering DOTARD ON US?
May it be written in the end that Brett Favre won at football and played golf with Donald Trump Who Is Not Racist while Anti American Communist Colin Kaepernick Whined and Cried Like A Baby just to call  the Best President Ever Donald Trump Names. Fixed

Well Georgie porgie is tight but in the wrong sense, President Trump brought them all together, all the crazies and nutjob liberal socialist Democrats out into the light...so everyone can see how insane they truly are...Thank you, Mr President , Trump2020
Trump is appearing more and more like a mentally deficient feeble, limping, teetering old Alzheimer's man these days.  He holds on for dear life descending the plane steps now!  It's time we get him away from the.nuclear button!
It's obvious that Trump's PROJECTING his mental defiencies and dotard walking limping dragging onto Joe Biden.  Why is he and Putin pushing a mentally ill dotard exhibiting stroke like symptoms onto the American people for a second term?,? Really!
Trump's walking or limping like a dotard this weekend. Is there is range of motion problems with his right arm? A FEEBLE SALUTE?  If he's right handed, why he holding railing with left descending Air Force One. Are those handicap bars on planes steps. ???
We should never be outraged at the FBI, CIA and other international spy networks catching the TREASONOUS Gop and trump in their suspected COUP to overthrow the government of the United States!  They want to punish others for exposing their TREASON!
How many years has trump, the Republican party and Putin been planning the overthrow of the USA. They have the  DAMN NERVE to bitch about international spy networks catching them, listening in, and sharing their TREASON worldwide! Hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha
When DJ Trump looks at Americans, this is someone who: .  Believes that white people are superior  .  Upholds slavery in the US and killing blacks  .  Believes women are inferior sex .  Believes the US Treasury is theirs What's staring us in the face
I really love seeing some of the comments coming out of Portland but I first wondered why until their parents support them so it’s how they were raised. They’re calling Trump a dictator &amp; that pissed me off because evidently they never seen a Dictatorship!
Let me tell you one thing! You need to see a Dictatorship! If you ever have witnessed one you’d be kissing Trumps Ass &amp; I don’t support Trump but I do know what a dictator is!
The whole damn globe should have been wire tapping, listening and sharing all that TREASON going on in the trump campy. The whole world was aware and all international spy networks were eavesdropping, recording and sharing that disgusting corruption and treason
This has not one thing to do with Trump but if you can’t see the Reason keep do whatever you’re doing! That’s what gets me they keep hollowing about Trump but it doesn’t matter who the POTUS is this shit isn’t about Shit!
Maybe El Trump O needs to build a wall around Portland &amp; this will solve everything!
This is what a fucking idiot would post, asking people to show up with weapons! Hate to hurt your feelings the 2A people support Trump &amp; his Force. So you might want to reach up someone else’s ASS.  This is the United States &amp;  have you ever heard “if  U don’t Love it Leave It”
3more so than farmers 3. Kowtowing to Xi early on as doing great things to combat the virus  Trump may lose the election because his negotiation strategy has been ill conceived. The only serious thing that could swing Independents and Democrats to Trump is that if they think
2focus on the possibility that he can take on China, better than the Democrats.  But Trump looks weak on China in my book.  He has not looked strong on 1. human rights, Uighurs 2. practically begging Xi to buy more American agricultural products to benefit his election chances

Democratic formula for election. Use media to race bait the public + use BLM to get people to protest + use protests as a cover to destroy cities + use protests as a COVID factory on steroids + film/take pictures of chaos + blame Trump = Biden loses in 2020

I fear for our country...if trump wins by cheating fraudulent means with GOP voter interference, voter suppression, or foreign hacking intervention the citizens will turn to the streets this time.  Republicans are forewarned....
If we imagine that "people" includes Iraqis and Afghanis, then Trump and De Santis will have to kill hundreds of thousands more US citizens to get even close to the number of deaths that George W Bush &amp; Co. caused in Iraq and Afghanistan

I’m in Chesaning Michigan right now. Mostly older white Americans. Seeing more Biden signs and Make America Compassionate Again signs than any trump signs. I’ve seen 2 businesses promoting trump, both auto/motorcycle repair shops.
Again  is trying to shine a turd. Funding HBCUs is chump change considering the underfunding from Republicans. For 6yrs the #CorruptGOP blocked funding for policies to solve the racial wealth gap in the US. Trump uses racialized politics to promote white supremacy.
The black caucus supported the crime bill &amp; Republicans wanted it to be even more regressive so stop trying to rewrite history! Trump also supported the crime bill.  #amjoy
All Trump supporters are not racist, but all racists are Trump supporters.
Look at the flight logs to Epstein's island.  Look at who his "good friends" were (hint: Trump wasn't).
The most notable recent example is Biden telling media back in January that in all likelihood he wouldn't be running if Mitt Romney were running for re-election rather than President Trump.
all i’m sayin is i started smoking weed while trump was the president. that night was my breaking point.
The ultimate threat carried out ! They must not allow minority Trump supporters to speak, just the beginning !

1st trump, The Final Countdown
Please tell me one single policy that Trump has enacted that is not flat out standard conservative agenda? They love the tax cuts, they love the xenophobia, they love the bigotry (just not spoken so loud). Let Rs reform their party, they dont need Ds to do it. Stop being tools.

Why might Fayetteville be different?  Well, we're home to the world's largest military installation: Ft Bragg.  It's also home to a LOT of DoD contractors.  In other words, constituents that matter to the Trump administration.

Cancelling the GOP convention was done not because trump was concerned about safety. Being a malignant narcissistic sociopath trump cancelled the convention was because he didn’t want another embarrassing Tulsa event.

I think Twitter is hoping that they can attack Trump until the election and he will lose. Trump fatigue may kick in and he will win.

Yes Trump is legitimate he won the electoral college . Russia is a Democrat lie.  We don't go by popular vote get over it.
Obama has secret society and his evil army is causing chaos in the cities Trump is cleaning up
I guess being a good leader is hurting women, but I wonder what that said about women who would've done the same thing as Trump if they were in office?
Plus you needed him to be successfulin this election just ask china is more like just ask trump what he is wearinga mask if cotona is so much of a "HOAX"
Here’s one of Trump.
He also told me that if we had a Democratic president they wouldn’t even be trying to make a vaccine. So apparently there are genuinely people who believe Trump is a good person? Idk. That shit is mind boggling.

Didn’t some official say that we could’ve gotten COVID under control if only the government and the people took cautionary measures? But remember how trump just said “Naw?” Like folks be talking about starting the economy again. It could’ve been started again if we listened
This president is out of control when and where will it end in November vote Trump out of the White House. Trump is like a mad dog, and the republicans are terrified that he would turn around and bite them and that is why they do nothing and say nothing GOP’s.
Republicans, you were told that this president is a very dangerous man. Now he is using our military against the American people. Trump is trying to destroy this great nation.
Trump-virus should trend everyday. Trump-Gestapo should trend everyday. We must speak truth to power everyday.
Shamefully, when trump, Barr, and administration officials hold news conferences to speak to the American people, we cannot believe ANYTHING they say.  We the people have lost confidence in this hop and administration.

Russia has figured out to take over the voting machines.  Mail-in ballots  ruin that takeover for Trump!
Trump failed the economy long before COVID
There's no excuse for believing lies or letting someone get away with telling lies. Trump failed the economy. Badly. Then the virus hit. Don't ever mistake the order.  #Trump #MyPresident #MAGA
You are toast Mr. Trump. Thanks to you Herman Cain is dead.
Two of those links overlap. Apparently Twitter won't let you just have a post of links?
LIVE: President Trump holds a coronavirus press briefing
And then there's this
Also
#HermanCain died because he attended a Trump rally and didn’t social distance or wear a mask. So there.
Please help me spread the word on this. Anytime Trump talks about the economy here's the reply.
Herman Cain is dead because of Donald Trump.
Don't forget about these
Trump killed the economy before COVID. Pass it on.
#Trump Suggests Delay To November #Election, But Congress Sets the Date
Let's talk about the economy.
It was bad before that
President Trump Holds a News Conference
Donald Trump killed Herman Cain.
November 3rd you're with humanity or with Trump. The two are simultaneous.
I couldn't find Trump’s ‘anarchists’ in Portland - Attention to the Unseen
Let’s see Trump’s major meltdown on this...I have a feeling it’s going to be a doozy.
Trump's idea of delaying the election is swiftly rejected by congressional Republicans - Attention to the Unseen
Is this why you are speechless? Is this the last time you saw him alive? I hope Trump is paying you well to lie to white America. Maybe it will ease your conscience if you have one.
"Sen. Tillis, should Trump postpone the election?"...
Trump’s racist housing tweet is par for his family
Obama’s rousing speech trolls Trump: Who’s the impostor now?
Welp, guess the tRUmp campaign knew this would happen having attendees sign a disclaimer to attend the rally. Pres. peckerhead didn’t care then and he doesn’t care now.
OK.Let's start. Higher minimum wage.Restore US standing in the world. Health care reforms. Rejoin WHO. Paris Accords/climate change. Tuition assistance. FHA reform. Smart immigration policies. Family leave. Control fossil fuel drilling. Universal background checks. Nothing Trump.
Exactly.  Obama has serious problems if Trump is re-elected.  He could be looking at jail time as Deep State criminals say they were "just following orders."   And there wasn't anyone above Obama.
Trump daydreaming about delaying prison gets smacked down by Nancy and Schiff.  Obama touching tribute to Rep Lewis, pushes voting rights, and statehood for DC/PR, end filibuster.  Nightmare for Mitch.
Should anyone think that Trump, Barr, McConnel, Kemp, and the like, are anything new,  read “A People’s History of the United States” by Howard Zinn!    Keep fighting!

Trump has weakened this country, brought us to our knees even, but he has also ignited a fire in us and now we are coming to take our country back!
Herman Cain, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate, has died at 74.   He was hospitalized in early July for COVID-19 complications after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa.
Bingo! Been saying this all day: #Trump just tries to distract. The worse the real news is (record economic plunge), the more ridiculous he makes the distraction. #VoteThemOut
Why not have the election today and get rid of the treasonous Trump regime?
Interesting that a racist like Trump is so intent on changing the color of his skin.  Guess orange is an ecxeption for him.
Only a select strategic few are compromised (Barr, Graham, Paul, Mitch, etc.).  Trump controls the rest through their big donors.  Collins is a prime example.
I don’t understand  I thought  loved Xi? You even were heard telling  You wished Trump would change course because he was getting money from China!
Trump jumped all over Blumenthal from saying he was a Vietnam Vet when he did not set foot in Vietnam during his enlistment during the Vietnam War.
Trump killed him in Tulsa, Laura and has misled countless Americans into death by shaming mask wearers and botching national response.
Dildo Trump planting the seed that he plans on an election delay and will fabricate the reasoning later
Like I said, I'm all for it. It will only bring down more of Trump's enablers who count on GOP mail in votes. He wants to force the schools to open, but wants to now postpone the election because it is to dangerous?? He's desperate! And the rest of the party knows it!
Go ahead Trump, delay the election.  Your term expires, the vp's term expires ... Pelosi becomes POTUS.  That is the way it works ... you do not get to stay because of the 'delay'.  So if that is what you wish, that is just fine by a lot of us.  Your ass is still gone.
Trump calls reporters to the White House for surprise event as Obama delivers eulogy for John Lewis. Not a chance this is a coincidence.
trump has foot soldiers working 24/7 to destroy our postal infrastructure to illegally disrupt our FREE ELECTIONS
Your son in law and your daddy tried to stop it years ago. Y'all better get your money together because your new treasury sec. Gonna demand all that money back including kodak. We gonna appoint an IG that trump can't fire from his home on BLACK LIVES MATTER BLVD.
He probably fought with trump
I don't think trump is aware. The end. Carry on....
Love all the anti-mail in ballot talk from Trump &amp; his supporters. Keep it up! Republicans have used mail-in and absentee balloting more than Dems. This does more to repress GOP votes. It is one of the most politically stupid tactics ever.
For those complaining about Obama's speech at John Lewis's funeral, saying it was 'too political', let me remind you that Trump has politicized almost every speech he's given while in office, in service of himself. Obama spoke only of the legacy &amp; causes Lewis championed.
#WeWillVote Trump OUT.
Miss him terribly. He may not have accomplished as much as a lot of us hoped, but in Trump's efforts to erase Obama from history, he has made us look back at him as one of the greatest of all time, especially in comparison to the current POS
And then Trump dismantled the pandemic response team.
I’m glad you understand. It’ll come in handy when President Trump wins a 2nd term as the silent majority again speaks.
All Trump is doing here is setting off another stink bomb to try and distract people from the fact that he is a modern day Nero ruling over his own demise.
OMG. Will Trump get paid?
Yes but guess what he wasn’t a treasonist tool of the Russian czar Putin. Trump it!
Honor the death of John Lewis by voting out Donald Trump.
Oh Jesus H Christ ... how is Nestor “feeling”? How many days since Trump knew soldiers have bounties on their backs and hasn’t mentioned it to Your leader Putin? Did you get your gas mask from your trip to Russia?
You support "Trump’s New Favorite COVID Doctor Believes in Alien DNA, Demon Sperm, and Hydroxychloroquine" over one of the leading epidemiologists on the planet and blaming China for the virus at this point is like Louie Gohmert blaming wearing a masking for getting the virus!

Why today? Because its Lewis's funeral? Because he's gotta coordinate his wardrobe to golf with trump? Because a pool boy awaits? What's the rush? (Rusha) #LeningradLindsey
Loving all the anti-mail in ballot talk from Trump &amp; his supporters.  Please keep it up!  Historically, Republicans have used mail-in and absentee balloting more than Dems.  This is just going to repress some of those votes.  It is one of the most politically stupid things ever.

Hey, No Nads.  Trump is trolling you and you're too stupid to realize it.
Seriously, Trump is the most insecure man on the planet.
For not being a humorous person, tRump jokes a lot.
But when the time comes, will they stand up to him? Or will they cave the way they always do under Herr Trump?
Sen. Jeff Jackson on Trump trying to delay the election  #avl #avlnews
Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election - This is ridiculous! Mr. Trump &amp; comrades are trying to make #America look weak &amp; not very bright. The only thing this incredulously #ignorant idea will do is make ⁦ president.
Have you listened to the Mueller Report podcast where they act out the report!? It’s hilarious—especially cuz Trump Tower Moscow was gonna be in “Crocus City,” a shopping satellite exburb!!
Remember the Trump Tweet Pattern:  • Float an absurd idea. • Everyone laughs and doesn’t take it seriously.
Donald Trump is hawking pizza after killing the former Godfather Pizza CEO after he attended that Tulsa rally.
Unfortunately I think you just got fired as Trump is capable of only one sadistic thing: firing people.
Amazing how they were able to get the whole world in pulm just to spite trump. That’s some nwo QAnon talking point crap
#Trump has given a green light to #WhiteSupremacists. They’ve always existed, but thx to him &amp; this  we see &amp; hear them loud &amp; clear. Good, we need to know these ignorant fools are out there.
“Trump Says He Did Not Ask Putin About Suspected Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops” ... still can’t wrap my head around that one, can YOU??
We keep saying "he can't do that." But he does it anyway. And there aren't ever repercussions.  Plus, Pompeo is already trying to subvert the legal/constitutional process in Trump's authoritarian favor.  I predict that we are in for a very, very rough ride.
The left is cheering for Louie to die.  Think about that.  Anything to make Trump look bad.
Herman Cain died for Trump’s Tulsa rally. Was it worth it, Cain family? Cain supporters? How many more are you willing to sacrifice on the altar of “dear leader”?
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill to go toward renovations of the West Wing, which have been planned and delayed by past presidents.
An edit, delete “Trump” and replace with “The media” and you are bullseye on.
Dr. Laura and President Trump are as responsible for Mr. Cain’s death as you are for all stupid tweets. Just this one. Not all.
Meanwhile, after the stupidity dust settles, let’s refocus: “Trump Says He Did Not Ask Putin About Suspected Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops” #distractiontactics #personwomanmancameratv #startpacking
Laid off in March due to pandemic. Watching this clown car #Trump Admin botch &amp; extend it, people sick &amp; dying, economy on brink of Depression. Fuck yes, my family and I are voting these bastards OUT. #WeWillVote
Trump is winning the media war because the more outlandish his statements, the more ways it can be attacked, disproven, countered, etc.  This prevents the necessary cohesive response to corner him on any single issue.
RIP sweet baby angel Herman Cain, he walked so Trump could run
Does the ayatollah lie 50 times a day on average on Twitter? Because Trump sure does. Maybe it’s time to delete his account.
How many more people have to die for Trump to care? None. He doesn't care. About any of us.
Trump has lost all credibility on this. If he really cared (which, of course, he doesn't) he would just completely step aside and give Fauci full control over all the pressers, and let Fauci determine what other experts to bring on board. But he won't do that...
Remember those who said Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were the same? Hillary Clinton would not have been holding rallies in the middle of a pandemic without requiring masks.
For folks processing the not surprising suggestion by Trump to delay the election, here is a great legal explanation of how the presidential election date is set, carried out legally, and a thorough explanation of "yeah, but what if..."
Herman Cain died because he went to a Trump rally and didn't wear a mask. Please, I beg all Trump supporters, wake up. Quit worshipping this monster. Wear a mask.  People are dying due the rhetoric of Donald Trump.
Also, voter suppression! It’s something that everyone who claims this election is decided is always neglecting. It’s a HUGE factor that could easily give Trump the win.
Honestly, Trump is so petty this is most likely an attempt to compete for coverage because he’s jealous of all the airtime that John Lewis’ funeral is getting. I doubt he’s read his own PDB about the decline in the economy.
More blood on Trump’s hands
I really need to know how the q people are handling trump tweeting about his friend's pizza in St James
there's no more "we disagree politically, but that doesn't mean we can't be friends"  If you support Trump i cannot stand you and i want absolutely nothing to do with you and your bird brain
Unlike Trump and the  SPLC does not feed on hate, does not perpetuate hate and does not target people to hate.They strive to counter injustice, violence, racism, discrimination, inequality and right the wrongs against fellow human beings. Is that what hate looks like to you?
Trump is trying to take away our right to vote. This right to vote is sacred. His dictatorship ends on November 3.
So why does the military and trump and the rest of the cabal use it? Just more bullshit from the cult leader. Stop drinking the cool aid.
Biden goes to the same place that everyone else in history has gone to to get an apology from Trump.  Let me know when you find out where that is.
Trump's Tulsa rally &amp; Cain's death. "Local health officials had called for the event's cancellation out of fears it could become a "super-spreader" event. Head of Tulsa Health Dept. later acknowledged the rally had likely contributed to a surge in cases."
Remember November 2016. The silent majority is organized, ready and waiting quietly to keep President Trump in office for another 4 years. November 3, 2020 it becomes official.
This is a case of how dangerous Trump is to those who listen to him and the consistent propaganda being spewed on Fox. No one should have to die. I take no pleasure in hearing this news, today.

“We should be working to eliminate discrimination in our health care system, not allowing it.” We could not agree more. Thats why we sued to block the Trump Admin's anti-#LGBTQ rollback, and it's why states nationwide are suing, too. Read more:

JUST IN: Herman Cain, a 2012 GOP presidential candidate, has died at 74.   He was hospitalized in early July for COVID-19 complications after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa.
Yes, but Herman Cain followed Trump off the cliff, though Trump took all the steps avail to him to test most peeps in contact with him so he is still still and still - living. Why?? Whhyyyyyyeeee?
NO ONE IS RAISING A STINK ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE BLACK AND QUALIFIED, WHY? THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON TRUMP'S TEAM OR BELIEVE ME THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT, BUT THEY DON'T, BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE ON TRUMP'S STAFF.
Oh no, know nothing pompeo. The decision has been made by the constitution. You, trump and barr don't know nothing about that...SCHOOL EM, DEVIL
Has he said anything about Herman Cain yet? Tweetered? Did Cain have a role in Trump's admin?
Do you think there’s the possibility for the same amount of corruption from the Biden camp and the Trump camp?

I may not be sold on Biden but Lord knows I’m sick of Trump and his shit. He has got to go
I think you are a victim of Trump’s FAKE news.  He is pumping his pseudo ‘Law and Order’ fist to draw attention from the devastation of the coronavirus and the economy.  All about reelection not the overall good.
Even if you say he's not serious....  This is how ish gets started........  You can't be the leader of the free world and think things like this don't matter.....

I'll bet you're super excited Trump dropped that bomb of a tweet right before you go on the air!
🤣🤣It really is amazing to see the Trump apologists twist themselves into pretzels to rationalize anything this fool does. He could drool in their oatmeal, and they’d say, “Thank you!”
Time to take to the streets en masse! "Trump floats idea of delaying the November election, a power granted to Congress, as he ramps up attacks on voting by mail."
Thank God, Trump cannot delay the election.  Pass it on.
Another COVID denier and conspiracy theorist goes down in flames. These are the kinds of idiots who have come to hold sway over the GOP, and any thoughtful conservatives and independents are abandoning them and hoping for a better post Trump future.

Exactly, they want these people to fall. Trump is creating false issues and not dealing with the main problem. He is trying to do away with anyone who is a problem.  Children in cages, dying all over, no money. He wants to kill us
Look, I totally understand. I shouldn’t speak for Black folks, but I do know how brothas in the hood think and I listen to my elders.Overall,we’re still very hopeful in America and wanted Bernie to win so bad but we let “electability” persuade us so we can rid ourselves of Trump.
First, let’s get rid of Trump. In 2024, we’re getting a progressive black woman who is not playing around. Just watch and see.
Please, where is the GOP health plan promised by trump 7/14 in 2weeks? Please go after this!
Where is the health plan ! Trump promised 7/14 he would sign the GOP health plan in 2 weeks. Even you should be able to figure out that date was 14+14= 7/28. Where is the plan !!!!

I might vote for Trump but I've accepted hes of pretty average intelligence on a lot of stuff
Trump did not know the location of counties with US troops.  So he asked Putin, who told him “Germany”.  Trump said “finally a place I’ve heard of, how many should I withdraw?”  Putin said, “Go big or go home.” Trump said, “That’s what I thought.”
Thank you Dictator Trump, for personally handing out the largess.  Who needs a democracy when we have your beneficence.
In Donald Trump’s America, low income housing equates to crime. That’s a lie. These are no longer dog whistles by the Birther in Chief, they are bull horns of racism. Don’t get numb to this shit.
More than 60 thousand innocent people died in 4 cities run by Democrats who denied doctors the right to prescribe HCQ.  They needed thousands to die so they could blame Trump. Justice is coming.
To win a majority – and control mapmaking -- Democrats must win seats in suburban and rural areas that President Trump won handily four years ago.  Like in Cabarrus County, where Democrat Gail Young is trying to defeat Republican House incumbent Larry Pittman.
I respectfully disagree, and here's why.... a person should only endorse products he is very familiar with and can speak about in an intelligent, coherent manner. Trump doesn't (can't?) read books, but beans....? As the kids say, that's his jam.
saw this coming like a freight train: their attempts to remove a Potus duly elected have failed: came the virus (suspiciously spread) and why not blame Trump for it?  Elite Dems, with the help of MSM Media  have encouraged violence and destruction.  Who' s paying the terrorists?

That they aren't Trump
The democrats weren’t looking in 2016. They were doing the opposite. They were hiding their own plan to steal that election too. That’s why election night Trump only had 1% chance. They were confident they succeeded in stealing the election.

Great advice.  But how about you take it, instead of pandering to the ignorant Trump Administration.

Not in my neighborhood.  Here the pro-Biden and anti-Trump displays, campaign signs, and yard signs outnumber Trump signs 10 to 1. (I see only one small Trump sign sorta hiding in a yard.) The anti-Trump signs are loud ad proud.  And I live in North Carolina.
Wasn't all tax payers money it's a hurricane people find anything to hate trump smh
President  has led the fight against #COVID. I look forward to joining the president today to highlight progress being made in our state for a vaccine thanks to his leadership and Operation Warp Speed. #ncpol
Check the numbers as many times as you like, she was never sworn in, never president.  I detest Trump
Is nothing off limit for our politicians (Trump is the worst I agree), even the ceremonial first pitch is now a partisan issue. Both sides on the isle go away and leave sports alone. You guys literally ruin everything.
He’s ahead in polls and increasing his lead.  Why exactly should he do interview on Fox?  Let Trump talk.  Best strategy ever.
Trump made it perfectly clear that he actively suppressed testing in order to make the numbers lower and the death toll higher.
God bless Trump in these horrible times.
I think the 2016 election destroyed a lot of trust in polls. I’m not saying Trump will win or lose. But it’s hard to trust polls when, last time, they were wrong
TRUMP 46 in 2020
Nc yes I will be voting for Trump
Well, I'd never allowed myself to watch you on TV before, but it's obvious you've drunk the Trump cyanide. Good luck. Grow your brain and compassion.
No, the fault in a ‘cute interview’ is the fact Trump won’t sit down with just any media outlet and take questions.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Trump University no longer exists! Trump casino no longer exists! Trump steaks no longer exist! Trump Airlines no longer exist! Trump mortgages... 11-03-2020 we will end this nightmare too
And that’s exactly what she did, she fought back! Glad Yoho is retiring anyway. Good riddens.   Donald Trump is a racist, she wasn’t lying. Y’all are the masters of deflection we call it “whataboutism”.
FUUUUUUUCK it’s hot! FUUUUUUUCK the coronavirus is still outside!  FUUUUUUUCK Trump is still in office! FUUUUUUUCK this! FUUUUUUUCK that! FUUUUUUUCK it all!  Just FUUUUUUUCK!!!!!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
Wow, what are we, in 2nd grade?? I bet you took the same test as Trump!!
Obama isnt the worst president but i view him in the same way i view bush especially in terms of civilian drone strikes and the continuing of the patriot act and other things i dont like about him. Also for the record i hate trump while i just dont like obama.
My wife’s test took 36 hours to get results back - in NC.  Not too shabby.  She doesn’t have Trump virus but some neighbors are infected, but that’s with cognitive dissonance version.
I get angry when I’m clumped together with radical democrats. I am not. Negrodamus shouldn’t hold all Republicans the same. I thank God for the Republican that stands against Trump and his cronies.
It's funny that the left found the biggest takeaway from the book is that Trump said she's stacked. God they work so hard against him and yet Fox News wins the ratings battle by a lot lol.
Mary Trump probably gets a lot right but it's a lot of trivial blind hatred so it's easy to care less about her than take her as an important voice
Warn our president, please! Antifa and gangs are rearing up to overthrow our govt. President Trump needs to declare Marshall Law to break up these groups now! When he wins, and he will, they will say he cheated and throw him out!  God bless your family and America!
If professing evangelical conservatives do nothing when Trump abuses the human rights of immigrants coming to their own country, how can you expect them to say something regarding human right abuses in other countries?
power corrupts all. I’m looking to rid this country of Trump and his cronies. You keep sitting on the fence, spewing past crap that doesn’t help our current situation .
Where does the responsible woman come into play here? Last I checked, Bush, Obama and Trump are in charge of all the killing
These groups are watching for nov. 3rd, Dan. Even if Trump wins, They are planning to overthrow the govt.  Warn the president! We conservatives are ready with arsenals! IT's going to be war!
You better catch up with the Trump agenda here. Experience doesn’t bomb
It’s about time he did his own thinking. Hopefully he’ll see what Trump is doing to this country and help fight back. Be a real hero Crenshaw
Imagine if France wanted to destroy Versailles!  The protest efforts comes from the top Democrats, aided by MSM in order to take Trump down.
I have to be honest. Since Trump has been in office, especially the last 6 months, I have drank too much, cursed too much, felt rage way too much, can't sleep. My anxiety is through the roof and I feel hopeless sometimes. Anyone else?
Trump - the antidote to sound judgement and reason.
Didn't vote for Trump in 2016, young and hated him. But seeing this, I'm definitely gonna vote for him
It translates into: “I am an angry bigot who cannot admit when the Holy Trump has done something wrong and must throw all Democrats under the bus based on unfounded information. Because you disagree with me, I must harass you and insult you continuously.”
I’m leaning towards Trump but let me sleep in it 😂
Go look up beefcastle_ on IG and watch his stories. He posted a great series on trump. It starts at the 3rd clip in.
Always when it comes to Trump
You can not be that serious??! How did Obama and Biden do ANYTHING for our economy??? Trump built it up and since his stance in office the economy was doing the best it’s done in 35 years so was the stock markets and unemployment was at an all time low etc WAKE UP VOTE RED!!!
Kneeling is actually MORE respectful. Ask a few vets who aren’t Trump loyalists...
Donald Trump has been a fragile and irresponsible all of his life. He’s been inherently dishonest for a long time. His narcissism has totally consumed him to point that his soul is damaged. He’s a cancer that has metastasized throughout this nation. God, please save us from him.
Don't tell us who we are! Trump is not racist...you are! Trump will win...
A Chilling Warning from Trump's Former N.S.C. Dir. of Strategic Planning  via
Trump was right about you.  He said if we voted for you, we'd have a corrupt government under scrutiny from day 1.  I voted for you and it is SO much worse than I thought it would be....and I thought it would be bad.
Trump: Throws a clear foul ball Trump later: iT wAS a pERFect StrIKE
Biden says Trump is first racist U.S. president  U if sleepy Joe gets in, he'll be the first pedophile. Keep your hands off those kids, you hairy legged pervert. WTF is wrong with you?
This Trump press conference is almost sad. Just resign already dude! OMFG
And, if you think Trump is doing the good work here, you need to think a bit longer and harder
I was in the military when the ACA was passed, so I didn't pay premiums. My disabled mother was finally able to get insurance. As veterans, my wife and I were thrilled that Obama signed the Veterans Choice Act in 2014. The one Trump falsely tries to take credit for now.
They are using this an political weapon designed to blame Trump for the chaos, the discord, the crimes.  Law and order need to be restored and people need to ask themselves if they want the country to go down in flame.  If it is, then they need to vote for Biden
While I realize Trump has made Twitter the de facto medium for his own public statements, please remember that that isn't normal. Biden has in fact made a statement on Portland.
Why name just one when comprehensive lists are kept of Trump's lies?
This is Trump’s America
Fuck Trump!! 🖕
Could it really be as simple as Trump is sending his death squads to Dem cities to try disappear Biden voters?  Asking for a country.
He really expects you to believe his words. We get Biden because we are SICK of you and your corrupt gop friends. Mostly....we are sick of lying Trump
Oh. My. God. What if all we’ve gone through in 2020 is just the universe preparing us for the lame duck presidency of Trump??? What might he be capable of in the few months following a lost election?
Hate when people say “this is what Biden’s America will look like” when Trump is president. This is America with Trump at the head
This video was taken in Trump’s America, buddy. 😕
Trump's America....is that how you do it  ?
That's another issue, the same idiots in this state politicized every issue we've come across. I don't believe Trump is good for America, he's dangerous. However I don't believe Biden will solve any issues anywhere at all. Why can't we as ppl just do what's right?
Trump might wish her well but my wish is that she rots in Hell
Why not ask simply ; where are the point of care virus test? Does other countries use them ? Does quest pay off trump ? Has the FDA approved point of care tests? Why ,why. Are you part of the cover up???
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 I fucking hate Trump and this administration!!
Typical Trump sycophant response, “property values have plummeted”. Who cares about property values CONGRESSMAN. People are marching and demanding justice and the best thing you can do is recite a tired racist Nixonian message of “law and order”. Get a grip.
I know Trump didn't write this!Well Said #Trump-Pence2020!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
Great Show Tonight  God Bless You, And Your Family, And God Bless America #Trump-Pence2020!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
January 20th is a constitutional hard stop for the Trump/Pence administration.  They can cancel the election, but all that will do is guarantee that Nancy Pelosi becomes our 1st Female President on January 20th.
It’s not funny. It’s true. It’s exactly how people in my area would talk about trump.
I’d move Moscow Mitch up. He gave us Trump with his SCOTUS antics.
That would indicate that Trump has any leadership qualities. He doesn’t.
I will vote Trump
How many more ppl are gonna die listening to trump and his lies
Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and not do what I tell you? Luke 6:46 Why, Marco? Why are you such a poor example of what it means to be a true Christian? Why do you pretend to be a good man, yet lack the backbone to oppose Trump?
🚨 ROGER STONE ISSUES NEW EMERGENCY MESSAGE TO TRUMP!
A stage four cancer patient had no business going out in public during this pandemic. Trump is responsible for his hastened death.
I’m watching MSNBC. No mention of Trump presser.
Very sad. It’s really even sadder that he didn’t have to die. He was high risk for Covid and chose to go to TRUMP rally, where he most probably caught the virus. Will doubters now pay attention?
I am comforted by their presence. I’m sure Jimmy Carter would be there if he could. Trump would have tainted this precious occasion.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Father in Heaven Bless Bill Barr, DOJ, President Trump and all members of Congress who want what is best for our Republic. Grant them favor in the sight of We tbe People. Give us elected officials in Congress who truly honor the Constitution and remove those who seek our downfall
This letter to the editor was published in our print edition today on page A4.
We wrote something.
"bleach" was a poorly-said metaphor where he was describing an actual effective treatment where blood is transfused out of the body, cleansed with ultraviolet light, then put back. It still needs more study. But Trump's point was that we should be willing to explore MORE options.
Well you know the Trump virus is very deadly. Nobody could have predicted the Trump virus. The #TrumpVirus is just that lethal.
And so how we lost in 2016 begins 🤦‍♂️. The Trump strategy, just sit back and watch them take themselves out. As a fellow Klobuchar supporter I’m sad to see this post. 🥺
Also on this day in 2019 Donald Trump signed H.R. 1327 bill, an act ensuring that a victims' compensation fund related to the Sept. 11 attacks never runs out of money. See more top news photos as selected by the…
Trump telling his dumbos not to watch Netflix cause he’s scared they might find out the truth about him 😂
I'm guessing Hannity bought stock when Trump touted it as the cure for COVID.
WTF!!! Barr is a Trump lap dog.
Trump won’t like that
Imagine going out in public and your mom is wearing a Trump shirt, embarrassing and very much tacky
I knew the return of Trump briefings would be rich!
AG Barr did not have a chance to answer questions.  The Dems talked over Barr, yelled at him and were overly rude.  This was not a hearing, it was an opportunity for Dems to vent their anger.  No question about it they were trying to get something else on President Trump!!!
#Trump-Pence2020!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
Yes and Jeffries should have said and Trump had 3 years to fix it.
A vid from several board-certified doctors who told the truth about their success rates in treating covid-19. Seriously, wtf Twitter? You're adding yourself to the list of those responsible for thousands of more deaths that didn't have to be that way!
Twitter has asked the president's son to delete a tweet with a video that runs afoul of the company's policies on COVID-19 misinformation.
You get anywhere outside of city limits charlotte, Asheville, Wilmington, and Raleigh it’s like another planet. The amount of trump crotch nuzzling going on here in NC is insane.
If Trump is Make Matters Worse , We'll call you Drunk Hating Nancy !
President Trump shared multiple versions of the video with his 84 million Twitter followers Monday night.
President Trump is a human being.  Everyone on this earth is a sinner.  All I know is he has greatly improved our economy, addressed illegal immigration, restructured terrible trade agreements and has made America great again.  Would u want your sins exposed?
Can't nobody be as terrible as your p**** grabbing President Trump
You have my vote when election time comes around and the vote of most of my family because you know, most of them have sense enough to see that the last thing our country needs is Trump and company making America ever more dumbed down.
Really? How do you type that with a straight face? Aren't you a fervent Trump supporter?
I hope he recovers, I really do. I will say that I'm not all surprised that he caught it attending a rally in the midst of a pandemic. This man is dumb - not just for supporting Trump.
bahahaha. That would actually be funny. I don’t think he would. Even someone as stupid as Trump has to know that without Pence, there'd be no President Trump. There had to be someone to bring in the bible thumpers.
This is one of those moments in history when you’ll look back with a mixture of shame and grief. Trump (or should I say Putin) has only divided this country. we are weaker from his presidency.
Sorry, I saw the videos of people scaling the southern boarder wall. If Trump is in charge of it, it won't stop a third grader. We could use the sign saying 'anti-climb technology' as a foothold to get needed height.
this hurts my heart. Trump has turned this country against itself and I can't imagine another president in the history of our country taking such diabolical steps to win favor from so few.
I still remember the opposite of that in disbelief. I was in shock in 16 when I learned the leader of the free world is a sexual predator, bigot, lier, crook, and traitor. It broke my heart. It wasn't Trump that broke it but the fact that some of the people I love voted for him.
No. The only time federal agents or soldiers should be deployed to US cities is in time of war or when civil unrest is out of control at which point the local authorities should ask for it. This has not been the case with Trump. he is playing a dangerous political game.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
Can't give out what they talked about in Trump's performance review. Come on man!
that last video of trump speaking death rates was in Mooresville Nc. Tell  to get Morrisville of the video
It sounds like his wall is as wind-resistant as his hair...
Of course he has not seen him since Trump skips intelligence briefings.  Guess O’Brien does not play golf.
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.
They are to blame Trump
You are right President Trump!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀🥇👌🏽
You are so right President Trump, And I am praying for you to win, and you will win In The Mighty Name Of Jesus Amen!!!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
Amen #Trump-Pence2020!!!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
I’d vote for him if Trump wasn’t running. Hopefully I’ll get the chance in 24
Exactly. It's not Trump's fault or Biden's or McConnell or AOCs fault it's us and the ststem we enable. #NeverBidenNeverTrump #DemExit #VoteGreen2020

Well Said #Trump-Pence2020!!!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀🥇
No guess about it. You are correct. His 50 year legislative record and his own televised tap into corporate donors telling them nothing will change from Trump to a Biden admin save tone &amp; temperament. #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Trump is only going to help himself. Same old con game.
If democrats despise Trump and conservative Republican policies, why do they keep voting for those policies and enabling Trump?
Hell yes! America is depending on “Trump 20/20”. These fucking radical demoncrats cannot lead this country into the abyss, and they will...
I think they are helping trump. Just like last time. I don’t like the 2 party system either, but now is not the time.
This connects with me because I am pissed off and disgusted by Donald Trump. You video captures the disgust we are feeling.
As U.S. debt rises, Biden's spending proposals near $10 trillion
I am sure that, if any Democratic president were saying and doing the things the current Republican president is doing, most every Republican would be apoplectic, with daily cries of "lock her/him up!"
TRUMP IS SETTING UP A FASCIST OLIGARCHY DICTATORSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, USING HIS GOONS TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES.
TRUMPLER HAS CALLED PUTIN SEVERAL TIMES THIS WEEK TO COORDINATE THE SENDING OF TRUMP GOONS TO DEMOCRATIC CITIES TO HELP STEAL THE COMING ELECTION. PUTIN USED THE SAME TACTICS TO OVERRUN CRIMEA. AND TURKEY ,,UNMARKED SO CALLED  S.S TROOPS.
Nikki your pandering really makes me gag. Selfless is the last adjective I would ever use to describe Trump. If you believed the crap about setting an example you need your head examined.
How are you so sure Trump  is the actual one selling those flags being made in the pic ?
Remember when this time last year one of the only scary things going on was we found ourselves relying on Trump to get A$AP Rocky out of that Swedish jail 😢  Simpler times
. America's first racist President?  #DonaldTrump #JoeBiden #History
Great Job President Trump!!!🙏🏻🇺🇸😀
President Donald Trump has canceled segments of the Republican National Convention scheduled for Florida next month, citing a “flare-up” of the coronavirus. Convention events will still be held in North Carolina.
Who has taught Trump the phrase,’Set an example?’  Seems to be a new concept for him.

A judge ordered the release from prison, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump.
You defend Cuban in one hand, and yet, slap a sitting president in the other. Your priorities are really screwed up. If you don’t like trump, that’s fine. But don’t defend this China-loving fraud.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
I got news for you, this is Trump’s America.
Haters do suck, don't they. This world has gone to hell. If they keep doing that, I'll give u my cell # and u show me ur tweets. Ppl just freaking stupid these days. Trump/Pence 2020🇺🇸♥️🇺🇸♥️
It is the Trump Virus. He is largely responsible for the spread of it and the resulting 140000+ American lives lost. His ineptitude is staggering.
Trump and Maxwell are both sexual predators so there is a common bond. Look how much time they've spent together. Plenty of photos to prove it.
Look at the US beating all those other countries. Nobody has more COVID-19 cases. The Trump Virus is the best Virus in the world.
COMMUNIST CHINESE PROPAGANDA VIDEO CLAIMS COVID WAS WEAPONIZED TO BEAT TRUMP!
Trump had been only one to stand up to China Mittens!!   Start there support your president   while obama and Hillary sold uranium  u said nothing
Trump just wants to divide us. He doesn't have empathy.
Why did trump sign a trade deal with then  usa and all ither countries need to Shut China town  they are evil
Does it matter to you at all that they weren’t burning until your party saddled us with Donald Trump?
Questions and answers about this unconventional, if not unprecedented, use of federal forces. Is it legal? What comes next?
well, there is the pandemic, Russian bounties, federal agents kidnaping protesters, and finally the terrific interview with Chris Wallace where Trump stated he might not accept the results from the election. So the fact that Trump is sympathetic to a fellow sexual predator, meh.
Nancy its Wuhan Virus...You were in China town when Trump was dealing with it. Ms. ICE CREAM ...WUHAN VIRUS WUHAN VIRUS WUHAN VIRUS
