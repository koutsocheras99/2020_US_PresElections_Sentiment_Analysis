I don’t think horatio is saying he’s voting for Biden just his opinion is he is gna win I agree with u Angelica pretty sure people see through this bs at least enough to keep trump for 4 more years
Trump vs Biden vs Kayne   Lemme flip a three headed coin.
I pray for a hedge of protection around President Trump and his family, his cabinet, his secret service and our great Nation every day. Every. Single. Day.
Horatio no offense man but remember 4 years ago dems want u to think trump has no chance so we don’t vote it’s old school games. Your wrong man people don’t want to defund police.
Lmao no he’s not he’s for defunding police trump needs suburban women’s vote if he has that odds are really good suburban women want police they don’t want low income house around them all Biden’s plan don’t believe the polls 😂😂 wait tell the debates!!!
In other words, a lie.  Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’
And the right is in a state of chaos that is making even its own supporters question it. Your point? Truth is, the trump train is close to derailing badly.
You're the type trump would deport, know that.
True but like we had a primary with solid choices. Biden won the primary pretty easily that's on us lile we have to rally behind him because sadly its bigger than him. Like I have no emotions about what Biden said Trump is so evil and corrupt as a Black man im just gonna have to.
But whats the alternative, Trump? Like he's worse.
Truth beats Democrats all the time. Trump has promised to build at least 500 miles of new fencing by early next year, and his administration has completed about 110 miles so far.
By being trump.
What happened to taking President Trump back behind the wood shed? Is that why you are hiding in your basement?
Trump is the closest ever to the Anti Christ, he is an imbecile and.......if I say more I may get put in Twitter Jail

trump supporters would let trump rape their own children, they'd even hold them down for him

Only an idiot or traitor thinks this election is about Trump. It’s about America v. Democrat communist global tyranny.
And if you don’t vote for Trump, you’re voting for communism and the end of the USA.

Then you are voting for Trump. While I agree we need a third party in politics, any vote for a third party candidate just takes one away from the person who can beat Trump.
To all liberal far left Democrats who continue to push Socialism/Communism..bad mouthing Trump is only showing how ignorant you are!  If you want a government control over your life then move to a communist country!  Don’t like Trump OK but save your life Vote Trump to live here!
If they don't make all of this information public soon, they will be obstructing justice for the purpose of assisting the overt regime change underway to unseat Trump in November.

That is the policy under the current laws. There are ambiguities in law, and they should be clarified. I don't particularly like it, I want the law changed. Still, even if everything you have interpreted is absolutely true, that STILL doesn't make Trump even 10% Hitler.
I already told you. Obama tried to end it. The courts forced it to be reinstated. Trump cannot make that go away any more than Obama could.
It's sticky and ugly, for sure. We should do something about it, but this isn't specifically on Trump.
My idealistic young friend, Obama tried to end the separation but was sued and had to revert back. The separation existed before Trump, and there were valid reasons for it. Human trafficking is a real thing. Kids are being hurt.
Which concentration camps are those? If you're talking about the border detention centers, yeah. Nobody said a word about those until Trump took office. If you're against something, be against it all the time, not just when it's convenient.
Trump is no Hitler. But, congratulations on going from zero to Hitler in one reply. You're a true warrior for free thought.

The problem with bluffing is that Twitter could just lock everyone out permanently.  That's why it's better to wait for President Trump to move to Parler first.

That guy was so dense. He never understood how its not about moving biden to the left but the voters. So many people moved to the left during obama it makes sense
Wow plays all that golf but yet donates all his salary back to government programs also has passed so many common sense bills. Wtf was Obama doing for 8 years? I’m starting to think he was Biden’s caretaker had to tie his shoes and shit
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report
Let's be clear... a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote against America. We'll be taking notes...
I will tell all of my friends and co-workers to vote to Biden like our lives depend on it.. I use to say that Trump is dangerous, well he is proving it now.. He has to go!!
And leftist organization and activism would be easier and more effective under a biden presidency no?
Organizing and protesting same as we would fight trump. Not only would biden not send the bagger vans but would cave in more than trump ever would
Agreed I dont like vote bullying trust me. But moving biden to the left will be way easier and productive than stopping trump from moving further and further right. Yeah let's organize but let's also work smarter so we don't have to work harder
As a former never biden person, I'd say we would have an easier time moving biden left than we would in stopping trump from continuing to move right. Not that it matters to me I live in a very deep red state so my vote here is wasted anyways so I'd organize as well

Biden &amp; Harris are LIARS &amp; LOSERS!! FACT: They have allowed &amp; encouraged riots &amp; looting to spread the virus. FACT: They blame Trump for the spread. MOST AMAZING: They think we are too stupid to see what they are doing!🙄
I think we have to wait till after he wins the election to start bullying biden to the left.
Roflmao! Your arrogance to actually  think you and Biden aka chimo Joe have a chance to win roflmao roflmao thanks for the laughs!#KamalaHarris
Keep your eyes on Biden, Patriots.....#HeelsUpHarris is a cheap side show &amp; distraction from what the libtards are trying to hide!
does the state office have any Biden signs??
Rudy it is kind of funny that your Daughter sees Mr. Biden differently, you are an old senile guy who once had the Nation behind but you sold your soul, so why you do not just STFU
There is only one important position in 2020, and that is to defeat Drumpf.  Nothing else matters.  Hard stop.  Harris gives Biden the best chance to win, and that’s all I care about.  I am much more politically aligned with Warren, but she is an easy MAGA target.
Health questions for Biden off-limits for media, unlike Reagan, McCain and Trump
How do you feel about Biden passing over all black females for a Jamaican Indian anchor baby?
I thought Biden was going to name a black female? He lied again!
Actually, this suburban housewife is a Biden voter, thanks for asking! And I’d love to have  in charge. #BidenHarris2020
89% think Biden can’t find his own ass using both hands!
WARNING! Anyone telling you they are a Republican voting for Biden is a liar. They are democrats trying to steal this election.
Joe Biden will Blow it for Joe Biden the poor Man is senile...
If you support communism, sexual assault, pedophilia,  systemic racism, fraud, domestic terrorism, riots, looting, arson, violence, black on black murder, economic collapse, total loss of freedom and liberty... well then, Biden/Harris is your ticket!
Biden/Harris stance on the Bill of Rights: 1A: no religious liberty, controlled speech, gatherings for only those they support.
The Biden/Harris combined record on harsh punishments for victimless crimes should terrify those communities hardest hit by their policies.
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
That description fits both biden and trump
congrats ...Biden could have done a lot worse ...happy he picked you
Hey Donny, you better be voting for Biden.  This country needs a good president and you are failing at your job.
Weeks from Biden saying "you ain't black" and that blacks are monolithic in their voting, his handlers choose a VP candidate that has done more harm to blacks than most in recent memory.   Bang up job, team Biden.
Officially in the Biden/Harris train! Please for Gods sake, vote! #BidenHarris2020
*Shrugs* 😑  BBC News - Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate
A lot of people are saying you are wrong. I would regret voting for Hillary or Biden. For Trump, best vote ever. Honestly, you focus on Russia yet you turn an blind eye on damage is going in Chicago or the rest of the country. Seems like you are a traitor.
With President Donald Trump pushing for a face-off with Democratic candidate Joe Biden earlier in September, state leaders have asked for Wyoming to be considered as a location if any debate is rescheduled.
Imagine if Biden was in there  we'd be screwed
Do u do this every time Biden has a blunder???😂😂
Last time I checked WW2 ended in 1945, the Spanish flu did not end WW1 and our current president is an absolute buffon but yes Joe Biden has the dementia issue
And Joe Biden is the guy with mental issues

Trump vs Biden vs Kayne   Lemme flip a three headed coin.
Biden just put his foot in his mouth about African culture. He’s hiding in his basement he’s not a leader when Biden wins make sure and tweet me 😂😂😂
Lmao no he’s not he’s for defunding police trump needs suburban women’s vote if he has that odds are really good suburban women want police they don’t want low income house around them all Biden’s plan don’t believe the polls 😂😂 wait tell the debates!!!
In other words, a lie.  Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’No thank you on Biden Being President!  Harris or Trump or Buttigier or Sanders or Clinton
Joe Biden loses his son.... Conservatives everywhere, including myself, send condolences and we'll wishes. The president loses is brother, and the left shows what maggots they really are. Despicable vermin.
Excuse President Donald Trump from the cruel Comments He has Spoke of Biden!  This is not very clean Politics!  Congress May I please request to Impeach Trump at Once, then have Michael take,his spot,  him some help.  I refer you President Donald Trump to get tour help in Casper

Stop with the mandate on the masks!  Biden I would like to sue you for your property of you mandate the masks and if the Government I will Sue if you will not let me breath at free will mandating the masks!  Stop trying to controlling the People!  A mask has air in and out
Open your eyes, Taylor!  Biden was against the China Ban in JAN 20 and called President Trump a racist and xenophobic!  President Trump's travel bans on China and Europe saved millions of lives from COVID-19, while the Democrats were against these travel bans!
A.) He promised his base a black VP and this was the best he could find.  B.) It doesn’t make any difference who he picked, he’s going to win anyway.  C.) The Dem Party wants a lefty like Harris to take over as president when Biden is taken to the nursing home next year.
Biden is not President Donald Trump is!
Biden and Harris Do not mandate People yo wear masks Ok I have not. Caught anything without wearing a mask! I em,inot going to accept that Vaccine that vaccine will get a lot of People sick! Biden you are rude for not answering the questions!
Biden I OBJECT ON THE MASK WEARING!  We shall step up and be able to Not wear A Madk! Three months, I cannot be in a mask do you have an oxygen mask? You can send everyone Biden to Mandate People to make People wear masks even though People cannot breath in the masks!
Biden isn't the hospital, Biden isn't the President!  Wearing a mask is trippin!  Stop Biden you are not a person to tell people to wear a mask.  I bought a mask but think about People whom has a asthma!  Do,mot mandate the Mask they are uncomfortable!
Eric Trump be realistic, Even though you are A Trump Doesn't Mean to be Mean To any other of the Candidates, Grow up! And Be Respectful! You do not see Biden Talking or even Speaking bad to you! So why be that way to Biden?  Grow up man and have respect!  Do you see all see what
When is Biden’s boat rally? 🇺🇸 ⛵️ MAGA!
These liberal polls are so LAUGHABLE!  Biden hides in his basement, refuses questions by the media, President Trump secures peace between Israel and the UAE, answers all hostile questions from the media, gets endorsed by the New York Police Benevolent Association Union!  LOL
New name's for Joe and kamala.  Joe (YOUR NOT BLACK) Biden and Kamala ( I GOT ON MY KNEES FOR THIS) Harris.
hey! Tell me more about the data regarding primaries and polling regarding Biden...if you would please!
Economic expansion under Obama/Biden? Are you on dope? They literally shrunk the overall GDP!
That's simple.... They are.....um....er....aaaaaah.... Telling Biden's accuser she believes them?
Hey.... Us simple rube trolls... I know are way less brilliant and sophisticated than...well, than the likes of you? But we have watched the gradual decay of numerous large, decades Dem run cities and being simple, think logic would say, Biden would bring that nationwide.
As for Biden being better? My opinion is he, like Sanders and many others, would be nothing had they not sucked off the teat of governmental power.
So.... You believe Biden and Harris are only running to save us from Trump? Alao, Trump is so self centered that he has lifted the yoke of government more than really any prior.... But through Biden's stated platform of more tax and regulation, he is doing you more good?

Diane Feinstein - 60 years in Government  Chuck Schumer - 45 years in Government  Maxine waters - 47 years in Government Nancy Pelosi - 33 years in Government Joe Biden - 51 years in Government
Biden/Harris want the federal government to mandate that everyone wear a face mask when outside, regardless of social distancing, but President Trump wants the governors to decide.  So, who's the dictator here?  Biden/Harris!
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
“Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum — every governor should mandate mandatory mask wearing," Biden declared.
Watching Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris Speak to Reporters Before COVID-19 Briefing
While  and  attempt to impeach  for an imagined quid-pro-quo with Ukraine, here is the actual quid-pro-quo from VP Biden's own words!  #QuidProQuoJoe
It started with a tweet from Dr. Jill Biden. “Hey (Douglas Emhoff). Are you ready?” she asked. “Ready to work! Let’s go (Dr. Jill Biden)!” he wrote back. So who is Douglas Emhoff?
No one on the other side cares about Biden lying. They actually like that he does.  There is zero advantage in pointing out liberal hypocrisy.  The only GOTV that will work for our side is for Trump to start fulfilling campaign promises. Slamming Biden is a fool’s errand.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
While the pandemic made a traditional campaign rollout impossible, it gave Biden and Harris a setting to emphasize their criticism of Trump as unable to contend with the most severe public health crisis in a century. Harris was particularly critical.
No, no, didn't see a Biden decal on his forehead, just one of those Chinese paper masks!  LOL
I noticed how Biden and Harris violated COVID-19 guidelines when Biden put his mask on the lectern, touched his face multiple times, then walked away after introducing Harris, then went back to retrieve his mask.  Harris touched her face multiple times as well!  LOL
I've seen one moron wearing a mask while driving their vehicle with their windows up.  It was some dude in a pickup truck who passed me from the opposite direction while returning from my dental cleaning.  I looked in my rear-view mirror as he passed, didn't see a Biden decal!

Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
Not if Biden and Harris win
Biden has beginning Alzheimer's.... Do you? Am I the first to say the "A" word?
Knew it, Joe Biden is a ninja turtle fan.
at 7am thank you for this. What a great start to the day. 🤣😂🤣
Well... Yes, she's a leftist.... Dangerous... But Biden and Gore were just as bad.
I wish he would have at least tried to advocate for himself more, and stopped calling Joe Biden his fucking friend. Either way, the result is the same.
The Democrat Party has REVEALED their racism by nominating racist VP Biden for President and he nominating Kamala Harris as his VP who is a descendant of slave owners!  The Democrat Party is morally bankrupt in their lust for power at all costs to include losing American lives!
That analogy about Biden being like your ex's hoodie fucking sucks. Also just want to flex that no one ever got my Opeth Morningrise hoodie. It was too powerful.
A token black woman,  so maybe as Joe "your not black" Biden must have figured out that  smelled better than the rest.  And this is his chance to appoint the First Black Female Democrat to the Senate. All hail President Harris.  We all know how this is going down.
The Democrat voters rejected Kama Harris in the primaries, yet now they are going to vote for her as VP and eventual President when VP Biden is incapacitated?  NO DAMN WAY!
In selecting Kamala Harris as his VP pick, Joe Biden has given into the mob. As a San Francisco lawyer and California Senator, Kamala Harris has been for eliminating private health insurance, decriminalizing illegal border crossings, &amp; a massive tax hike on hardworking Americans.
Kamala Harris is NOT a radical leftist. She's actually like, a moderate right winger, just like Biden lol
Given the fact that Biden is on Death's door, and can barely put a sentence together, I have to politely disagree. But adopting any meaningful progressive policies would have went a long way.
Loving the VP pick, and wouldn’t it say allot if Biden picked Steve Schmidt for a cabinet position!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Lol, all of this just to end up with the Biden/Harris ticket we all knew we'd get.   DNC just a well appoint they nominees for President and VP and save us all the time we wasted.
Come on, MAN!  Senator Kamala Harris DENIED Judge Kavanaugh due process at this Senate Supreme Court Nomination Hearing!  VP Biden will not be President and neither will corrupt Senator Kamala Harris!
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, is also one of the party’s most prominent figures and quickly became a top contender for the No. 2 spot after her own White House campaign ended.
The DUMBEST move VP Biden can make is to elect Susan Rice as his VP, way worse than Kamala Harris in getting people to vote for President Trump because of how bad Susan Rice is because of Benghazi!  There is no way patriots are going to allow the liar of Benghazi to be VP!

Given that Trump advanced Obama’s agenda more than Hillary ever could have dreamed of doing, I’d say a vote for Trump over Biden is the actual vote to accelerate the destruction of the country.
Three of Wyoming’s top elected officials are calling for presidential candidate Joe Biden and current President Donald Trump to hold a debate in Wyoming.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that Biden is the lesser of the two evils.    Now, I would never vote for Biden but I certainly won’t vote for the greater of the two evils either.  Writing in Sessions or going Constitution Party this go ‘round is the only sane option.
The fact is, for several key reasons, Trump is much worse than Hillary would have been, or Biden will be.  If you don’t understand this then you haven’t been paying attention.  Listen to  to gain a clue.
Biden allies hope the historic nature of his pick might help energize two key Democratic constituencies: women and people of color.
That and Biden is a weirdo around kids.. plus how is he gonna say “U ain’t black, if u vote for Trump”? Like they didn’t catch his ass saying some racist shit.. look up.. when he was younger he literally went in film and said some anti Black shit ..
Admit it Mark, you want Biden to pick Harris just for the future comedy value. 😁
Trump should do a press conference:  “I’ve ordered my FBI to do no more investigations into the Biden campaign than Obama had his FBI investigate into mine.”
Leadership Dems prefer Trump, otherwise why nominate Biden?  Trump has done more to advance Democratic policy than Hillary ever could have.  They want more of the same.  With Biden hiding, he’s beating Trump. Hence, they need Biden out in the public eye so he can lose support.
This is so painfully obvious I literally don’t understand how some people on our side don’t see it.  No previous Trump voter will vote for Biden. They just won’t vote for Trump.
It's ironic to me that Democrats falsely accuse President Trump of being a racist, while ignoring the completely racist comments coming out of VP Biden's mouth in the past month!  Democrats have always been and continue to be the racists, using minorities solely for their vote!
I'm amazed at how Democrats can't see the incompetence of VP Biden in picking his VP that was due on 1 AUG 20, and here we are now on 8 AUG 20 and he still hasn't announced his VP pick!
You would be correct sir. I think it's a setup too, to get both biden with Ukraine,  and Susan with the tarmac meeting.
I'm in Casper, WY.  Wyoming voted 3 to 1 for President Trump over Hillary in 2016.  I expect an even greater spread against Biden in 2020!
VP Biden's criteria for a VP pick is PURE GENDER DISCRIMINATION and RACISM!
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
