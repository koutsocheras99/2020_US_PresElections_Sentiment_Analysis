“We have state politics to worry about and that’s what I’m running for, not federal office. And all they cared about was if I was supportive of our president.” -  “Unfortunately...Donald Trump whether you love him or hate him, has turned people insane.” -

The WaPo story on how the group is mainly running ads in DC trying to bait Trump into tweeting is just unreal. It's like we're being goaded into participating into bullying on all sides.   I'm so sick of this administration dragging us all into the mud.

No. Trump raped women and little girls
I live alone, very isolated in the north, and have never had a flu shot, nor needed one. This fall, clearly, will be different. I might get one this time. But I won't get a covid-19 vaccine until it has nothing whatsoever to do with trump.

When Trump claims a false victory, when refuses to leave office, we will not be able to say we did not know.   Those sounding the alarm about this are not alarmists. They are simply going by the evidence. We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario.
DeSantis is only “great” by Trump standards because he’s a loyal Trumper. If was a democrat and the least bit critical, he’d be a “nasty” person. Though he only uses “nasty” when he speaks about women who are critical of him.

This is precisely what Mary Trump chronicles in her book. Trump's handlers know how he should answer the question. Trump may even know the answer that would be most politically expedient for him  He can't do it! He hasn't the capacity for kindness. That is the key to knowing him.
Dan!  Lol.  Maybe you shouldn’t have given Trump a pass.  You’re the radical right!

The Trump administration has made this conflict fast worse, and my team and I were warning about Wagner half a decade ago and two administrations have done nothing to stop these thugs
Also, watching this reporter react to Trump really demonstrates how obsequious most US reporters are when they speak to those in power.

An ordinary person should absolutely be able to be president. I mean that is one of the tenants of Democracy.  It is just that person has to be trusted to follow the best advice and admit it.  Trump can’t form half a complete sentence.
I won’t shame someone’s intelligence. I absolutely will shame their inability to realize that and surround them with more intelligent people. That is pretty much Bush compared to Trump, right?
I can’t understand why his handlers allow him to do this. If Trump didn’t go on TV and put his foot in his mouth because COVID, I think he could have unfortunately had a chance.

Holy f*ck-- what an ass!    Mad props to  for calling Trump out and putting up with his bullsh*t.
Good point. I would ask Trump to name 3 three things he has done for black Americans. He keeps spouting the line that he has done more for black Americans than any other President, but never provides evidence of what he has done for them.
Honestly the way Trump has handled Covid is likely impeachment worthy. But the ship has sailed on that, Democrats blew all their political capital on protecting Joe Biden 🙃
Wait, isn't Durham tasked by Trump to investigate the investigators?  And so would Durham's indightments you are referring to be a big counter narrative designed to distract from #Volume5 ?
#TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpFailedAmerica  Frightening to watch a manic narcissistic attempting to feign a sympathetic reply when sympathy isn’t an emotion in his being. If Trump was just your crazy next door neighbor this would be disturbing. He’s the POTUS. 😬
Well, I can assure you if the polls were saying that Trump voter's enthusiasm was less than Biden's it would be national news and the MSNM would be telling how much it matters
I just can't believe I'm living in this era of absolute idiocy. The planet is flat? Lizard-people run the world? Masks are harmful, not helpful? Trump is a solid president? COVID-19 is a conspiracy? What happened to people to make them even remotely consider any of these!? 😵

Trump says Covid is under control and they have done everything possible to control it. Then where the hell is our federal testing and tracing programs, why is there still not enough PPE, and why are we losing over 1,000 people day? And “It is what it is” is not a suitable reply.
I couldn’t watch the full Axios interview with Trump because he is so full of magical thinking and revisionist history. He is very, very sick and we are dying because of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica

Trump is laying the foundation to challenge the outcome of this upcoming election. He is a monster, an authoritarian who demeans the very foundation of our democracy - the right to vote, all while killing thousands with his negligence. #Biden
Could anyone be so incredibly stupid? Trump just doubles down and tries to bully this reporter every time he is proven wrong. Moron.
South Korea has 54,000,000 people and 300 Covid-19 deaths. Under Trump, we have 330,000,000 people and 155,000 deaths. Do the math - Trump’s incompetence is killing us and it never needed to happened, but Trump says “it is what it is”.
Is this satire? Trump can’t be serious. This has to be a poorly judged piss take.
Trump didn’t care about coronavirus deaths because originally they affected only the blue states. He then tried to make the governors solely responsible so he could escape responsibility for the needless deaths of tens of thousands. Trump is grossly incompetent and a sick liar.
A president takes an oath to protect Americans. Trump refused to listen to our scientists and experts, perpetrated lies and basically did nothing, absolutely nothing against the coronavirus. Yesterday other countries had 0 or 7 deaths - the US had over 1,200. Trump is killing us.
Donald Trump is so small. He is tiny. John Lewis didn’t attend George W. Bush’s inaugation because he didn’t think his election was legitimate. But who spoke at Lewis’ funeral - George W. Bush.
We had over 1,200 deaths from Covid yesterday. Other countries had 0 or 1 or 7. Presidential incompetence has killed so many of us, and all Trump does is lie. #Biden2020 #Biden

Trump is so effing weird. The country is in economic ruin. Over 1000 people are dying every day due to a global pandemic and Tump is spending an inordinate amount of his time fretting about an app for wacky dances and swimming dogs. 😕
The devil and trump have never been seen in the same room together at the same time 🤔
Actually your PM can’t be anywhere near the global embarrassment that  is. I don’t even know who he/she is. I’m pretty sure 3/4 or more of the entire world knows who Trump is due to the incompetent, vile, evil sorry excuse of a living creature he is.
For 2015-2020, as Trump defied all the laws of political gravity, many wondered what it would take for him to finally fall to earth. Turns out it took a crisis requiring competence, hard work and empathy to finally open people's eyes. Better late than never. #TrumpIsLosing

Trump answers a question that has long perplexed me: Don't insane people realize just how insane they are? The answer is no. Sad that instead of getting the help he needs, he's surrounded by grifters (including his own kids &amp; the entire GOP) who hope to profit from his madness.

Re: the last set of tweets I retweeted  My five year old students saw a real trump rally with no social distancing or masks- and they all asked me why they weren’t being safe. And I had to tell them, that those ADULTS weren’t using their listening ears
Petersen is a GOP Trump troll.
I’m white did not and would never vote for Trump.  The issue is we need to vote.  Less thank 50% of Black, Hispanic and Asian Americans voted in 2016.  I am going to make sure I help as many Americans get to the polls this November.  No tweet or post can do more  then a vote.
when I read headlines like this all I can see is the naked propping up of Trump the media engages in because they don’t know what else to do (many of his latest endorsements have lost). Ty for always pointing this out
Good for Trump.
If you believe that Biden has caught Trump in Ohio, you suffer from the same cognitive disfunction that  Biden does.
The anti-Trump pettiness knows no bounds.
God bless our president Trump!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

The nigga from barstool tried to keep it real when saying he thought Kaepernick was an Arab who didn’t wanna take a knee b/c he was a terrorist and trump invited the nigga to the White House.. idk what type of real you talking about rn 🤨🥴
I was saying it doesn’t matter the party.. there’s a best choice for the country’s sake and then there’s the rest who didn’t meet the cut but you were saying trump like he was the savior in all of this lol
Is there a swanky, failing Trump golf club there?
But I would’ve respected your argument more if you would have still voted republican regardless of trump running or not.. it just sounded like you like trump tbh when stated w.o reasoning
Ok I understand the argument of democrats not fulfilling a commitment to minorities but Trump is definitely not the answer. Definitely tweaking by tryna throw that out there like it’s valid. 🤧
So your choice is trump based off “numbers” that would’ve been similar to any other president who’d have gotten elected at the time he did... only difference is trump is fucking up society at the same time ... “money” (for who exactly)&gt;&gt; Quality of life of everyday people
I seen the thread w. Jee.. now politicians is puppets and be bs’n a lot.. my question to Cheg is, Besides Donald Trump, which republican candidate would you vote for because you don’t sound too informed.. you sound like you’re repeating the news stations just like his followers
More Americans favor Capitalism over Socialism; Order over Chaos; Founding the Police over Defunding the Police; Merit-based Immigration over Open Borders; &amp; Freedom of Expression over Political Correction .  That how &amp; why Trump is leading.
There’s a group of BLM protesters in Peabody square and they’re blaring the song “fuck Donald trump” ❤️❤️
I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.

Panel rejects Donald Trump's request to add a fourth debate with Joe Biden  via
#MoscowMitch needs to go too. Anyone who aided Trump needs to GO!
Bernie was the candidate of the actual people. Bernie was leading before Super Tuesday. The democratic leadership knew Bernie would lose to trump so they basically put all their money and effort behind him. It was the right choice, but let’s not pretend dems wanted Biden.
trump....the virus is JUST a virus....but trump gives the virus a red carpet to kill all of us due to his stupidity.
Why isn't Trump sending Barron off to school of it's so safe? Hmm?
This is taken out of context, as per usual via racist rag Breitbart. He was referring to voting trends, not people's actual genetic make up. They grasp at straws to make Biden look bad, trump does it all on his own.
So far, trump has invited Russia, China and Ukraine to interfere in our elections.  Did I miss anyone?
Haven’t seen a single Biden sign or bumper sticker here in Massachusetts’s. People are quite proud in their display of support for tRump here.
How are they going to fight The media's narrative on it? Trump would hammer Biden on it but there's going to be no debate so he can't
It's not exactly a curveball of a question the first time, but the fourth?   via
Can there really be any doubt that he’d rank against literally any republican who isn’t trump?  Even if the Dems carry 2020, 2024 will be a nightmare again.
⁦    And you have the audacity to criticize Biden!!
It's really painful how obsessed Trump is with water pressure. He rarely gives a speech without devoting at least five minutes to it. It's just weird, like he wants his tombstone to say "Donald J. Trump. He gave us water pressure."
Why would not blame Trump for COVID-19 deaths from all around the world. And while we at it, why not to blame him for all world mortality!
After every Trump campaign ad, a voice should say, “I’m Coronavirus and I approve this message.”  #GhislaineMaxwell #DeutscheBankComplied #BritishOpen #YoureFired
The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
God is immortal, Trump can't hurt him but he can make Baby Jesus cry.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.
Do people do “tRump” because they think it fools the Twitter algorithm? (It doesn’t)  Or do they do it because you read it as “t-rump”? (That’s funny)
Dear Governor DeWine, you can break quarantine and meet with Trump. He's taken malaria medicine and it's just a cold.  Just shake the man's hand and sneeze in his face.
Then why is everyone's yard signs say, Trump?
Reminder: Trump cheated on all three of his wives and paid hush money to both a porn star and Playboy model after affairs with them while  was still pregnant. He’s also been accused of sexual assault and/or rape by more than 2 dozen women.
Who has Trump saved by ignoring the virus, and by sitting on his thumbs instead of working day and night to resolve this.  But, hey, "it is what it is".  Nice way to explain away the thousands that are dead.

Because the Democrats are using it to get Trump out of office. There. Simple.Sanders couldn't beat Trump, followed by literally all but one centrist dropping out.

I'm 40 and can't understand why Donald Trump is president.
Trump said Biden hates God. That's why this came up, no one's suggesting we vere from a secular pose
Trumps mouth can be described best like this. If he was on his first date with the love of his life and she cooked a shitty dinner. Trump would say “the food sucks and it taste like shit” I love that about him always brutally honest.

I love the talk about the Swan interview, but: it is the understatement of the decade to say that Trump "has not reckoned" with racism in America. He has very specifically reckoned with it as a step toward deliberately worsening the lives of black Americans. Simple: he's racist.
That came from reading and not hearing. For years I pronounced Colossians with a long o in the middle, and filled a moan for Philemon. By itself it did not tell me Trump did not know the Bible.
First off, I am pretty sure Trump held the Bible right side up, weirdly, but right side up.      The upside down cross is the cross of Peter. Satan has no cross

In an interview, candidate trump said that he has never asked god for forgiveness. No religious person would ever say that. Only the penitent shall pass through the gates of heaven. #biblicalidiot
One of Trump's greatest triumphs is getting political reporters to uncritically repeat his own hagiography as a shrewd negotiator.
There was also once an airline called the Trump Shuttle but I guess whoever ran it was a lousy businessman or something.
President Trump should give a major speech to the American people outlining every offer, and the sequence of offers, which the Pelosi-Schumer legislative dictatorship has rejected. He should note each group that was being hurt by the Democrats’ intransigence.
It won't happen with either Biden or Trump. There is no pushing Biden left. I refuse to vote for either. We need neoliberals out since they are what directly lead us to Trump.
trump is afraid of Warren. She’s the only person in contention for VP that has a ridiculous nickname. She gets under his skin. Biden should definitely pick Warren.
Actually he is. Biden is a fascist. Biden is why we have Trump.

This may be fine, but does Trump know anything about the issue, what it means and what the implications are? Likely not, since he doesn’t study anything in detail, except maybe, just maybe, golf. He is one lazy slug.
No but seriously. Here is another clip of Dinesh D’Souza  pronouncing Thailand like every other English speaker pronounces it, not “Thighland”.  Why would he claim everybody says it like this? Is he paying Trump back for pardoning him?

Liberals are going to be so confused when and if Biden enters office and the protests don't stop. "But Trump is gone!" Yeah. And Black people are still being targeted by the police. And now it's Biden bolstering them.
I know politicians have to (or feel like they have to) play this game. But Biden isn't going to budge an inch on any substantive issue. They need to sell him as "not Trump" and hope it works better than in 2016. Nobody buys this narrative except Republicans.

You're right....if  had been elected President instead of Trump, this country would not be like it is now......it would be infinitely worse.
The entire premise of the question accepts Trump’s framing.
If Trump started accusing Biden of eating monkey brains, reports would start asking what Biden had for lunch.
Being a conservative is totally fine. It’s about perspective.  wants to put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. What a message beyond the obvious fact that there are many qualified Black women judges ready. Trump can’t even say a nice word about

For the record, we've had more than 1 bad prez, changes should've been made after Nixon mess, then we wouldn't be in position we're in now! Trump has exploited every weakness, LEARN from it! Cks &amp; bal's = good thing! Times have changed, just like Electoral College gotta go.
You acknowledged it though... very Trump-sequel. He invested money in it, yeah?  “Mouth-breathers” or not, people find them stylish—whereas electric cars were notoriously unsexy.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:

We have that under the ACA, which Trump and GOP have been desperately trying to destroy. This is only news for uninformed people who buy your 🐂💩.
Trump will require insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions  #FoxBusiness   WORLD PUBLIC * INTERNET NEWZ
Trump always told us “We’re going to be first” &amp; he finally succeeded.
Trump can’t spend taxpayer money by just signing an executive order. Only Congress (House and Senate) can approve spending taxpayer money.
Apple declined to make Mr. Cook available. Instead, the company helped arrange calls with four people...One had never met him, another met him only in passing, a third spent half an hour with him and a fourth spent a few hours with him.
If you believe Trump can cure people you’re probably ready to swallow Lysol
While not responsible for the coronavirus itself, the Trump admin was/is responsible for our response, and of course should be accountable for the result of said response. Which is safe to say... a disappointment. From hoax, to enabling conspiracies &amp; distrust, to no-masks... 😤
Please use your brain. If US w 4% of world pop had that many deaths what would effect have been worldwide. Regardless, Trump has done nothing to stem tide except incompetent slow ban on travel from China.
True but there is a fundamental difference. Biden may be as inarticulate as Trump, but he will surroun himself with expert advisors and, more importantly, he’ll listen to them. Trump surrounds himself with people who praise him and he fires them when they offer differing opinions
I would worry about the US government and not Huawei, TikTok, and WeChat. — Trump is the problem. — He’s probably sharing information with Putin.
They both do, as does just about every white American. But nothing like the problem Trump and GOP have

This is a classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome, right Brendan?
You’ve got to be kidding. How stupid do you and trump think we are? It’s been law for about 7 years. Thanks, Obamacare!  What do you think you’re doing. 😒

No. No deal was reached today. Supposedly; negotiations will continue over the weekend. Both the House and Senate are on vacation, but, they can be called back to D.C. on 24-hours notice to vote on a bill. Trump and the Republicans don’t want Pelosi’s $3.4 trillion bill.
It's like you can follow the exact people benefiting and profiting from Trump being in power, despite the obvious signs of incompetence.
What's the deal with the trump/drug bill that he won't let anyone see? He says drug companies have to see him by Aug. 25 to make a deal with him... with HIM....
Trump banned TikTok and WeChat. Are video games next?
Aug 7 - part 3 DC - Mnuchin, Meadows walk away from relief bill, say Trump will issue executive order BTB - holds campaign rally/press conference, says nothing worthwhile BTB - says he will shut down TikTok in 45 days if it isn’t sold
Aug 7 - part 2 DC - after telling Chuck and Nancy not to worry about ballots, Postmaster General fires 2 dozen top level staff EL - Intelligence community says Russia is interfering in the election for Trump, China and Iran want Biden (so does everyone else)

I don't really entertain the fantasy of locking up Trump after he leads office. I just want him out. But lemme tell you, that does not apply to people like Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, US Senators helping Russia interfere with our election. We need to throw away the key. #TRMS
I never understood how Russia is talked about for the elections. I can tell you my Democrat and Independent friends were 100% Trump. We just played the game and kept quiet at work and some social settings to keep the peace. 🤷‍♀️ What’s wrong w Russia anyway?

So,  &amp;  have decided that they are happy to work with Russia to interfere in our election to help Trump. I know Johnson has been a traitor since his 7/4/18 trip to Moscow, but I guess Chuck wanted in on the goods. You both deserve to be in Leavenworth.
You mean the fear.mongering that Trump is doing? Saying mail in vot49ng is bad? Tho he does it. That fear mongering? Slowing down the post office, that fear mongering? Kiss my pattotie.
Yeah. Trump rally, huh.   I bet the tax payers don’t stiff the owner of this hall like trump usually does for one of these.

Then Russia is losing.  The way I see it , this interference is either by 1- advising Trump, &amp; it’s clear Trump’s advisors in general suck  2- bribing &amp; corruption in the election process, would mean Americans are cooperating. Those people will lose everything for their treason.
Trump is a boor. His daddy's money paid for his time at Wharton, where, obviously, he learned nothing. He has bankrupted his airline, multiple casinos and had his school and charity shuttered due to fraud. He's a con and only the unintelligent support and defend him w/hostility.

Trump lies and we all die. Go back under your rock
Yes, exactly! #MoscowMitch blocks everything, relishing his "Grim Reaper" persona, so Trump has an excuse to rule by executive order. Start with little things, even existing laws, to normalize the idea that of course all laws come from the president... presto, GOP minority rule.

This isn't crazy, it's deliberate. McConnell obstructs everything in the Senate. Trump, with support from Barr and John Yoo, rolls out more and more EOs to cover things that are already law as well as things that aren't. They can't win a fair election, so oligarchy it is.

The Trump Administration is arguing before the Supreme Court to strike down the law, which requires coverage of pre-existing conditions.
You can tell the effectiveness of a policy by who is p****s off. Trump has ticked off the pharmas and now the insurers.   In contrast Obamacare ticked off no one, which is how I knew it was a sell out.

Why is the #Trump Campaign funding the #West campaign? Why?

Megan is no fan of Trump so what is her problem with the Lincoln Project??
Like so much of #Trump's rhetoric, his claim that he won’t step down if he loses can be dismissed as ranting to fire up his base.  But it could also make us more attentive to the fact that, in a democracy, losing is actually complicated business.
I knew it.
If Trump gives them a set deadline and say’s “listen, I tried, but they want way too much” and signs an executive order that adds 400-600 to people’s check, that would be a win for Trump.  If the Democrats were stupid enough to sue, that would be suicidal
I'm guessing he's probably going to devote every possible effort to thwart Chinese efforts while somehow totally ignoring everything Russia is doing. It's been a consistent theme throughout Trump's presidency; the redirection of hostility against Russia and scapegoating China.

President Trump Holds A Peaceful Protest
Wookie’s upset cause this would virtually guarantee Trump is re-elected. His list of “offenses” reads like a Liberal Democrat’s greatest hits.
April was four months ago yet Trump virus is raging. What happened to it disappearing in warm weather?
Trump lies, the US economy dies.  Great GDP numbers.
Executive orders was abused by Obama, it’s only fair Trump should get to... I don’t have any great argument cause you’re probably right.
Are you trying to depress the Black vote? Why do you keep putting VP Joe Biden down on "All In?" Sorry that your candidate lost. But, it was Black voters who felt from day one that Joe had the best chance of defeating Trump.
Guess Trump press conference is a political rally and not a an event to update the general public. #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie

What would you need? Him to admit he's a cheater? Him to admit he committed treason? You're the same people who are desperate for an Obama era scandal but with Trump you need more evidence. Totally incapable of seeing what's been in front of you.

How does a “deadly virus” have people who are exempt from getting it? 😂 That COVID is a smart fucker but kinda racist since it only goes after white people at Trump rallies 😆😂
Jerry Falwell, Jr. and Donald Trump, Jr.: separated at birth?
I'm a person of color and most of my friends who are either voting Trump or Jorgensen, due to Biden's racist past and his push to make declaring bankruptcy more difficult while raising HC, and his declining mental health are the main reasons they aren't voting for Biden.
It wouldn't be a Trump press conference without Trump taking credit for something Obama came up with. #preexistingconditions
Friday night is Trump mob's time to hide their sleazy moves.  Hoping Speaker Pelosi and Senator Warren can stop this blatant attack on a fair election and our USPS.
Yup. These are the people that Trump has at his news "rally" addressing the people that will be living out of their cars shortly.
Congress holds the purse strings. Trump can’t just declare a stimulus package.
Much better. I read this book right after tRUmp was elected. The similarities are chilling.
God Bless President Trump
This is how I know that it is not incompetence re: trump virus response, but deliberate genocide.

At least you don't dispute that MF is a right-wing political operation. Good luck getting those Trump talking points to resonate around here. But don't let anyone stop you from going to NH if you think it's so much better.
All true except the 3rd-rate gangster. He's head of a New York crime family that's grifted and avoided prosecution for it for generations. But even the Teflon Don finally got into a snare he could not slide out of. I hope Trump hits his soon.
This ghoul is literally a traitor. Stop defending him!  This isn’t “Leftist Democrats” dreaming of John Lennon, this is HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE AGENCY saying he is working with Russia to swing the election. All of you worried about “mail fraud” WAKE UP!
As Trump digs in, will it be US versus China in tech?

Jerry Falwell was the head of Liberty University, Evangelical college.  His father started the college.  And, he was ousted because of nasty photos of him and a younger woman.  He was a big leader of the Evangelicals and HUGE Trump supporter.

Trump is fighting this:
Trump is fighting problems, that aren't problems. Or maybe he's continuing to take credit for others.
It’s not bewildering. Falwell has always been a grifter and a player. Like Trump.
a better verb than "pulled away," when referring to Trump, is "recoiled"
Trump falsely claimed Biden is against the Bible and will hurt God. Is there any evidence of Trump being in a church, except for weddings and funerals, prior to entering the 2016 race? #TrumpLies #DonTheCon
Tucker Carlson cut off Trump while Trump is still going, and his face looks irritated that his show got cut by 10 mins due to this #TrumpPressConference
So I guess Trump's big health care plan reveal is that he's issuing an executive order to command insurers to do something that they're already required to do by the law he keeps trying to repeal
We don’t need another Trump lunatic in the White House. Kanye go spend time with your family &amp; chill. Go away &amp; stay away. #BoycottKanye #boycottKardashians  Stop this madness.
I had lots of people (including my own brother) who told me “of course I didn’t vote for Trump.” That didn’t mean they voted for Hillary, and  it was a few years before I realized they let me assume they voted for Hillary when they actually voted 3rd party or write in.
🚨 HUGE NEWS 🚨   thinks you're all idiots. And  announces Executive Order to repeat what is already in Obamacare. Like with Veterans Choice, that President Obama signed into law, Trump desperately tries to take credit for Obama achievements.  MAJOR!
President Trump confirmed that he plans on issuing an executive order to address expiring student loan relief for millions of Americans. But many questions remain unanswered.
You are literally spreading disinformation. Of course pre-existing conditions are already covered. And Trump is in court right now trying to repeal. Delete and do significantly better.
Trump teasing Executive Orders as a relief bill alternative is one of his smartest moves. He's couching it with the usual racist tropes and magical thinking about the virus disappearing, but if no deal comes from Congress, some of those convincible may like this.
Funny a day trader being mad at Trump. You short the wrong equities today?

Wow. You really ARE brainwashed by FOX. Trump is the crook. He used his charity to make money, which is why the NY AttyGeneral shut it down. Just like she (a black woman) will do with the NRA.

Christ. Even Trump's version of "elitism" is trashy. These people are the private guests a "billionaire" supervillain President? This looks like a "Wives-And-Kids-Allowed Good Quarter Party" for a Minneapolis boat dealership 🤣

Trump already said that he extended unemployment benefits ,stop morotorium eviction till  the end of the year and eliminate payroll taxes one year. Just  watched his task on TV. He didn’t say anything about state funding, , no testing no ppe money.

Comparing a guy like Trump to Biden is just ridiculous. Joe Biden attends church regularly. Trump has his storm troopers clear path to a church, assault the Pastor, Just so he can get a picture of him with a borrowed Bible held upside down. Who’s the better person here...
The Trump party in opposition is going to denounce every single pandemic policy as dictatorial, unnecessary, weak and insufficient all at once. I would like to be excused from the 2022 midterm elections, I'm feeling unwell.
The Left is done unless Trump wins. A Biden victory will be a massive shift in the Overton window, and any left-wing energy will be 100% discredited for at least a generation

I could be over reacting to Trump China news 🤷🏽‍♂️, but I’ll tell you what, an attack on $nio is an attack on me 😡 I WILL NOT sit here and accept this SHIT! I’m going NOW to run downtown totally naked with #nio markings etched all over my skin in permanent marker until arrested!
If this were trump it would say “Trump slammed on both sides for divisive and racial rhetoric against black and latino communities. Kamala Harris calls for unilateral prosecution and death penalty.”
$nio could sell 10,000 vehicles a month for the rest of the year it won’t matter. Trump shut down ALL Chinese stocks. They’ll all fall down. No positive company news, positive numbers, sales, earnings, etc will help Chinese stocks. Trump signing executive orders is STRONG! ⬇️😡
Yeah, another 1.4 NEW unemployment claims this week! REAL NUMBERS, NOT TRUMP NUMBERS!
Trump loves Trump, not America! Has he ever admitted any mistakes or wrongdoing? No, and he never will. He’s mentally incapable of taking any responsibility for anything. Just ask him!
You think Trump is normal? Won’t be voting for you!
$nio is expected eps is -$0.34c let’s say if it comes in AMAZING like +$2.20 lol it WONT MATTER because the fear of investors in Chinese stocks due to Trump over shadows it all
Friday $nio should’ve have been a 🚀🚀🚀 going into the weekend anticipating earnings but the Trump news has brought $nio and other major Chinese stocks Alibaba, JDcom, Tencent, etc they will TANK on the fears of moronic investors. It is what it is. Just buy more 🤷🏽‍♂️
It’s lower than its open, it will continue to sink. Trump shut Chinese stocks down today stupid people run in fear it is what it is
Wrong. But you go ahead and dishonestly pretend that Biden and Trump are mentally comparable.
That’s great!!! What an equal, diverse government our President has created, thanks Hilary for showing how great Trump is doing 👍
"Thighland" is the funniest thing Donald Trump will ever say, and he owes it all to being a fucking idiot.
Not anymore. Trump has bigger plans ⬇️⬇️⬇️
All Chinese related stocks and shares will drop 15%-20% today. You can thank Mr. Trump.
Doesn’t matter now $nio will come crashing down thanks to trump possible $1-$2 area
Doesn’t matter anymore it will come crashing down due to Trump
Now all Chinese stocks will plummet. You can thank trump for your discount today. Maybe now we’ll see $nio hit $6 get ready to make big purchase orders on others fears
You are such a stooge. Let's match the liar in chief's lack of a record with anyone. How about this for a starter? "Hey Joe, ever kill 160,000 people? No? How about you Mr. Trump?"
Um.... Donald Trump I can actually understand and he makes perfect sense when he speaks. I have no idea where you are coming up with this bullshit. Zero Idea... no Biden.... he is 9 donuts short of a dozen!
Except Trump isn’t from England Australia or India - he has a hard time actually reading - it’s obvious and he doesn’t even skim his speeches before delivery - reading then is always the first time he’s seen them
You’re running for Congress never miss a chance to screw somebody over so you can get elected sounds to me like you’re playing a card you shouldn’t be Joe Biden will be a better president Trump the chump
Get your hand away from that and stop ‘Amusing l’ yourself lady pay attention to politics how does that sound Donald Trump is a walking stroke victim You’re defending a man has to get naked just to count to 21 🤣🖕🏼
Twitter is a GOP platform once Donald Trump is thrown out of the White House and onto the sidewalk which I hope comes true literally Twitter will probably vanish into obscurity just like Donald Trump
That’s everything Donald Trump has done everything Donald Trump has tried to accomplish has come out negative he has hurt God country and Citizen Donald Trump is a worthless piece of garbage
This makes my day! #KAG #Trump/Pence 2020
I take that back... yea I think it will actually. You’ll have people pull out of Chinese stocks just because of fear around Trump making any other future bans or surprises.., I think we’ll see some reaction to all Chinese stocks including alibaba
Is there any part of the Bush administration that happened or do we have to memory hole all of it? Will anything Trump's done have happened?
Jim Acosta is a Fake reporter? Donny Trump is a FAKE PRESIDENT

Wear a mask + vote trump out
Hey  - go fuck yourself.    Jesus doesn't approve of your dirty, cheating tactics. And your buddy Trump is in NO WAY a man of God.  Wake up.
Absolutely- not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. And she couldn’t even explain why she would chose Harris over Rice. This is absurd.
1) why would Harris get it and Rice not? Wouldn’t you expound on that in the article  2) a vote for anyone but Biden IS a vote FOR trump - did you not learn anything from 2016? 3) neither rice nor Harris are an imbecile Palin. Both would be fine choices
This sound bite from Trump is yet further proof that he is which? Choose at least one: A-sexist B-racist C-idiot D-hypocrite E-utter embarrassment F-unfit to lead G-obsessed with AOC H-all of the above  Hint: all answers are correct, and you never had to step in a real classroom.
Eric Trump I reported your tweet..good luck..
The NRA leaders are destroying the NRA by robbing it (members) blind.  They must have went to Trump university for training.
My friend told me that she struggles with fear every day during trump’s administration. But  public response bashing trump, which went viral online, really gave her a lot of sense of belonging and made her feel safe again in this country. From then, she knows ......
I didn’t agree with the rhetoric used against R’s before but what trump is doing is beyond the pale. There is no comparing him to decent republicans of the past. You let your hatred for liberals cloud your judgement- you hate them so much you’ll accept the illiberalism of trump.
Trump loves to talk to the press by noisy helicopters.  I guess even he knows nobody really wants to hear what he says. #VoteTrumpOut
No, it’s an absolutely essential thing for democracy. The entire Trump administration should rot in prison. In gen pop.

The Trump campaign's latest contest is a scam. Here's proof.  by
President Trump hard for me to say that he is who he is we elected him and the ones that didn't we still got stuck withhim🤷‍♂️ he made a comment to make America great again took to that because America is great what about America becoming greater
You and Trump make a great couple seeing you aquitted him..spare us chuck..Democrats gave you their covid package proposal back in May but you refused it because it had no money for big corps or tax cuts..you cut unemployment from 600 to 200.UR Scum Chuck
I feel like we’re having a party transformation where liberals turn to a progressive party and establishment Democrats and Republicans turn to the Democratic Party making the Trump destroyed GOP, locked in history
Just to let you know Trump is under Criminal Investigation for tax fraud..bank fraud..money laundering..He lied to your workers..

Trump Campaign Busted For Deceptively Manipulating Biden Photos In New Ad    via
👇🏻👇🏻 This x 1000 👇🏻👇🏻 He needs to win desperately; private citizen trump will no longer have the protection of the presidency to protect him from prosecution.
You’re a wack job! There is no difference between mail in and absentee ballots. The verification process is the same for both. Trump wants Repubby states to do mail ins and the democratic States to be restricted. Gee, that’s sounds really fair, doesn’t it?
Finally FOX TV News notices some of Trump’s flaws
Like how bout the Trump organization crimes..When are the indictments coming out??
What? Not about Trump??

You know you’ll never see a picture of trump praying    Trump never has and never will. Ask him to recite the Lord’s Prayer. My bet is that he can’t. He is not a Christian.
Only 2 reasons to support Trump....You are a millionaire....you are a racist. You get to pick one.

Dark forces is right. Trump and Flynn, Kennedy and Graham, k.i.s.s.i.n.g.
It’s a game to them Same reason why they call Trump mentally unwell while he goes on three rambling episodes a speech
I once said that Trump’s win was a symptom of a gravely ill nation. He is so grotesque a tumor that we may finally accept and fight that disease. ⁩“Trump’s racism—and that of his allies and enablers—has been too blatant for Americans to ignore or deny.”
Your insideous comments and misinformation campaigns are killing people..Finally! Twitter bans you from tweeting..keep it up and they will ban you for good! Twitter is not your private political platform. Keep your crap off twitter!
Fauci has been a beacon of light during this time and of course Trump wants to snuff it out.  Only liars need apply to work with Trump and he’ll take them down with him. #ItIsWhatItIs

Trump 2020
NY State AG holding a press conference at 11:30 AM regarding something of National Importance ?  If anything is related to a Trump, could shake things up a bit.  Most likely Trump sons with  as a To Be Indicted later Co-conspirator.
Name me one thing that Gump Trump has done to unify our country. He is a treasonous cur who is hateful to his core. Even his own party is abandoning him and throwing support to other Republican a presidential hopefuls
Listen to Trump state many times from March until August that the Covid 19 virus is going to go away. During this time over 150,000 Republicans, Democrats, White, Brown, and Black people died. Supporters and detractors. DERELECTION OF DUTY. HE ABANDONS EVERYONE! TREASONABLE!!!
Donald Trump is a FAKE PRESIDENT!!!
Dems are hellbent on hiring illegals for cheap labor(slave wages) instead of Americans. While Dems advocate for higher minimum wage for Americans,it is their sneaky plan to hire illegals. This is what the big deal was over,make hrly wages too high.
Reality Bites
Coming for you... Face reality
This is so horrific!  Donald Trump is pure scum.
At some point, does a few more $T here and a few more $T there matter ?  I think we have reached that point.  All Federal Government deficits are now free.  FED will fully fund all ZuS deficits and change zero interest.  It all comes down to Trump totally mishandling COVID-19...
Bill Barr has a ‘tell’ that reveals exactly what he will do to win Trump the election: Former Justice Department spokesperson
You have any proof or just more Trump lies
Can’t agree.  Optics suck, especially since it’s one of the 3 swing states that gave Trump the win in 2016.
Are you serious. We wouldn’t have a clue how corrupt the Democrats, the media, and the top ranks of our government really is. God save America. Trump 2020
Before Trump, only Trump thought the USA could file for bankruptcy and get out from under their debt.  Now after 3 years of Trump, everyone hope he was right.
Yes and I’m one of them. I wholeheartedly support President Trump’s re-election. But asking me give again when I already have that day is a little much. I am retired and give what I can which is quite a bit actually if you add it all up. Just saying.....
Ya, what Charts will Trump use to explain why he is boosting employed worker paycheck, nothing for the unemployed.  Trump will go on National TV and put a gun to his head.  Payroll Tax Cut or I shoot.  Not an unemployed person in US who would stop him.
No, this is gross incompetence of Trump Administration on full display to the World.  Trump is mentally ill.
No Republican Senator has a say on whether there will be a deal or not.  It’s Trump’s call, will he bend over and hold his ankles enough to satisfy Democrats.
Listen trump is a moron too. The fact that there the 2 people we have too choose from is sad, BUT this dude is cooked, like cooked like a well done steak. Pray for the USA.
say what you will about trump, but at least i'm allowed to say "merry christmas" now &lt;3
Changed my mind, I'm back to believing Trump would wipe the floor with him
Donald Trump is a disgusting, careless human being. For the record, absolutely no one cares if he watches the NBA, or any sport for that matter.
How many people will it have taken with it when it goes? RIP - I’m sorry your lives did not mean enough to Trump.😢🙏❤️ #ItIsWhatItIs
Makes sense to me
Trump is a "traitorous disgrace," but not for Russiagate. What's sad is Democrats hand Trump a counter-attack tool when they continue to heap Russiagate on him.
Exactly. Trump said “let’s postpone the election”.......he also said “kids gotta go back to school”. The virus is to much to have an election, but he’s totally fine with putting kids at risk. Make it make sense.
The really have the entire GOP apparatus to thank (Trump, politicians, Fox News and other right wing media, etc.).  This is why we won't be opening schools, can't play sports and our death rate is higher than anywhere else.
Multiple other states will be catching up soon.  He was the first person who had to deal with the unknown when Trump left every man (state) for himself.  The whole country looked to Cuomo to find out what was going on when they couldn’t get the truth from Trump.
Trump calls for first presidential debate to be moved up due to early, mail-in voting
Try watching something other than CNN and maybe you will see the truth.  How have you not seen all these videos of people getting ripped out of their cars by protesters? Or people being attacked cause they have a Trump hat on? You live in a liberal bubble ...
Trump may very well decide that no deal is in his political benefit.  The more chaos the better could be his thinking.  Cook up something with China to.  Given how he looks at virus data as improving, he may not be following a data based strategy.
Something something Trump himself killed the economy.
Right up from his gut. Think about that. Nothing comes from his head or his heart.
Remember when you meet with Postmaster General Louis Dejoy keep these things in mind..Trump got a big donation from Dejoy..He has no experience..He is tampering with US mail delivery. Don't let him fool you. We can not have him in there.

Nothing you can say is worse than the Trump virus he is responsible
Fake news caught lying again. Trump 2020
We have far and away the most ridiculously idiotic moron for a president, but “IT IS WHAT IT IS” 1,000 people a day are dying, but “IT IS WHAT IT IS” Trump claims we can’t compare the % of death rate to the total population because he say as so??? A complete and total ASSHOLE!!!!

“If” Trump is correct it could be the last “positive” jobs number before the election.  There are already signs of economy beginning to decline again as Covid-19 spiked in South and CA.  Now other States are spiking as others plateau.  Florida appears hopeless.
Just a reminder as we all freak out about Trump: all those “normal” republicans are totally fine with shit like this
These are the years Trump will be considered the worst president in US History.
Democrats openly want to destroy America. Wake up! God save America. Trump 2020
🤮🤐 so young to have sold her soul   You can’t have morals and work for Trump.
trump is a murderer and the GOP are accomplices.
Banning TikTok might be the only good thing Trump could do as President. I fucking hate TikTok bro.
I thought he was tucked away up Donald Trump’s ass or any elephants ass really #GOP 🤣😜 sorry to all the actual #elephants of the world I know it’s an insult comparing you to Donald Trump a lower species
I'll apologize first,I'm sorry! But I have to tweet a happy song from my school days 52 yrs ago or so. Please remember it was a long time ago. Trump takes the lead,Trump takes the lead,hi,hi,the dairy-O Trump takes the lead!!! I improvised a little. #KAG!
It seems so deliberate at this point concerning trump, but lol even asking Biden to just do that is too much let’s be honest 🤣🤣
Donald Trump just called Lebanon an Attack.

I remember this one time I forgot what "German" was when I heard someone say it. I thought it was spelled "Jermin" and I thought it was something dirty. I'll never forget that feeling...  ...anyway I feel like that's where Trump exists most of the time.
Damn you went haaaaaarrrrrd at Trump
Fear mongering from the spineless trump toad.Sanders couldn't beat Trump, followed by literally all but one centrist dropping out. Biden's voters were those motivated by the idea that he was a stronger candidate.   Nobody can win if they can't run a good campaign (Corbyn) and the amount of time and money -c-
Donald Trump is a voluptuous Chinese grandma
Trump also made a mayor announcement stating that he has just discovered the wheel, saying “ that’s a really big thing, nobody ever did before”.

The fact that it's taken 40 years and President* Trump for smart, well-educated Republicans to start abandoning the party, when Lee Atwater said this in 1981, tells you all you need to know about normalization and privilege.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Trump sees his re-election slipping away. His shitty base is not large enough, he needs more voters.
This is part of the strategy by Trump, his enablers, and #MoscowMitch to gradually turn over power from Congress to Trump so that he rules by executive order. They can't win a free and fair election, but they will at any cost preserve white GOP rule through a mafia oligarchy.
Trump is disgusting. Such a piece of garbage. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden2020Landslide #DumpTrump2020
They both do, as does just about every white American. But nothing like the problem Trump and GOP have
What's the deal with the trump/drug bill that he won't let anyone see? He says drug companies have to see him by Aug. 25 to make a deal with him... with HIM....
Actually, you’re running on empty, creating straw men because Trump has nothing to show for 3 and half years in office except the destruction of the US
More gaslighting bullshit from Trump’s liars  Miller knows what everyone knows. Pre-existing conditions are ALREADY the law of the land, thanks to Obamacare  He knows it and yet is amplifying trumps’s absurd propaganda  He, Jason, how are the kids?
Of course he knows. This is weaponized gaslighting  All the trump lickspittles are amplifying this nonsense
Yes, exactly! #MoscowMitch blocks everything, relishing his "Grim Reaper" persona, so Trump has an excuse to rule by executive order. Start with little things, even existing laws, to normalize the idea that of course all laws come from the president... presto, GOP minority rule.
This isn't crazy, it's deliberate. McConnell obstructs everything in the Senate. Trump, with support from Barr and John Yoo, rolls out more and more EOs to cover things that are already law as well as things that aren't. They can't win a fair election, so oligarchy it is.
You’re funny and likely right. Now explain the George Conway behind the anti-Trump Lincoln Project married to KellyAnn Conway, the spin artist for Trump? Are they both laughing at us all at night and well paid by the political machinations as our democracy spins into disarray?
I knew it. I think I just heard that the postmaster general fired a bunch of top leader ship at the Postal Service. So now Trump is getting his way around the Postal Service. In addition Grassley and Johnson are doing Russia’s bidding. Heaven help us all
This is deliberate. #MoscowMitch keeps congress from doing anything. Trump begins to rule by executive order. John Yoo provides memos supporting it. They gradually expand executive rule until we have a de facto monarchy, or at least mafia oligarchy.
I speak more languages than Trump and am more educated. I went to excellent undergrad and graduate schools. I’m a published author. I’ve traveled extensively my whole life. You sound like an idiot defending what was probably a just an accident. Give it up.
We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures ⁦

Much better. I read this book right after tRUmp was elected. The similarities are chilling.
Wow. You really ARE brainwashed by FOX. Trump is the crook. He used his charity to make money, which is why the NY AttyGeneral shut it down. Just like she (a black woman) will do with the NRA.

Nero doesn’t have anything on Trump. Trump continues to fiddle away while the US burns. There’s not a single ounce of empathy for the people of the United States. This entire pandemic could have been mitigated had the moron in chief listen to the scientists. God help us all.
When I say even in these deep blue state suburbs, Trumpers are still believers, I am not at all implying Trump would win this state.   That’s ridiculous.  What I’m saying is I don’t trust white voters not to vote for him.
That’s why I have 13 followers. Seems like people should like it more when I get drunk and say I hate Trump or when I get drunk and say things about the Celtics.

A Trump hoax. All staged so Trump can throw out some money to boost him in the polls.
You are so right. This all feels staged. Trump wants to prevail. We are so lost.
Deep thoughts: sometimes I think Trump is secretly a progressive Democrat hell bent on destroying the GOP because only someone who hates the GOP could make the decisions Trump does.
The Republican Party has gone all in with Trump. Like Lindsey Graham said so prophetically, he has destroyed the Republican Party, and they deserve it. They do not deserve my vote, ever.

Reagan was about as white supremacist as Trump, which is why 91% of African Americans voted for Mondale in 1984, so just put her down as yet another white supremacist
Bottomline: the Republican Party doesn’t have the selfrespect to run their sorry candidate for president without the support of Putin/Russia. Biden will reject all interference. Trump asked for, received, benefitted from, and rewarded help in ‘16,can’t call out Putin to this day.
wonder if they're Russian

I “travelled” to Bucharest once. I was changing planes. Had a coffee in a very massive, very weird subterranean lounge, alone but for an ancient woman vacuuming the largest rug I’ve ever seen.   Trump‘s ‘travels’ are the rich person’s version of that.
Trump, the cosmopolitan. That’s a new wrinkle

Hey  ...let me remind you: Trump was IMPEACHED. And always will be.
Biden doesn't need to beat Trump when Trump is doing a fine job of beating himself.
Ban all Apple and Starbucks products and trump will listen because he will have both CEO’s jumping all over him and other CEO’s will follow suit so if you want to see trump cry and then listen do it this will hurt him more than you know
Biden not only has a website but decades of public service showing where he stands and how he will govern. (You might not want to hear it, but cf Trump’s decades of lying &amp; gritting.) ½
Trump is afraid of a first-term Congresswoman.
The people who choose to watch this speech, other than those paid to watch it like the press corps and consultants, could care less about Trump's "defiling" the White House. The rest of us have better things to do.
The way it's supposed to work is the CDC and White House work together on a federal plan. And then that gets rolled out to the states. We had no federal plan because Trump didn't like Fauci saying things were getting worse, and getting better ratings.
We’ll call it the Trump University Fraud Act.
The Trump/ Tax Giveaway to Donors and Billionaires gave us $TRILLION deficits as far as the eye can see. Trump gleefully dismantled our defenses against pandemic,ignored and belittled warnings, so now,as if unprecedented indebtedness wasn’t enough,we have 162000 dead.
I love the talk about the Swan interview, but: it is the understatement of the decade to say that Trump "has not reckoned" with racism in America. He has very specifically reckoned with it as a step toward deliberately worsening the lives of black Americans. Simple: he's racist.

There was also once an airline called the Trump Shuttle but I guess whoever ran it was a lousy businessman or something.
Could it matter in WI? I guess, but Biden's margins are likely going to be large enough in most states to produce a decisive outcome in both the popular and Electoral vote. Biden has many routes to 270 EVs. Not so for Trump. For instance, winning AZ's 11 EVs while losing WI's 10.

I mean...I remember Trump being a punchline back in the 80s. He’s always been a joke. He’s always been what dumb people think rich people act like.   He’s a boorish imbacile that has convinced people that he’s a shrewd businessman.

You suggested that Congress needs to extend the Census fieldwork deadline. How would that work? It likely wouldn't pass the Senate, and even if it did, Trump would veto it.
Trump made his bed. He must lie on it
And what is Trump an expert in? Getting hundreds of millions of dollars and businesses handed to him from his dad which he then drove into the ground and into multiple bankruptcies? Not sure what else.

Trump corrected himself right after saying Thighland so.......
There’s  who’s leading the states against Trump; Suffolk  who has shredded the old boys club;  heading up the State Senate, pushing major environmental reform; a diverse and impressive Boston City Council for the first time. The list goes on. 5/x
Also - whataboutism -(saying this shiny thing over here is also ‘bad’ isn’t a valid distraction from the fact that Susan Rice is a horrid vacuous human being). Trump being a narcissistic whore doesn’t make her worthy of being one heartbeat from the Presidency.

Democratic negotiators dismissed the idea that President Trump could unilaterally provide new jobless aid and cut taxes in the absence of a deal in Congress, where a fundamental clash over the size of the next coronavirus-aid package have brought talks to
And Trump said: “Let there be water. And see, I can walk on it and turn it into wine”
Trump sounding eerily close to some stuff my uncle said on fb recently
The Democrats are doing what’s best for all the actual people involved - keeping them alive and healthy. You and the GOP are only doing what you fantasize will get Trump re-elected.
Why was Trump able to recently place one of his cronies as #PostMasterGeneral (PMG) of our cherished #USPostalService....during a pandemic &amp; upcoming #Election2020 ~ obviously many of us will be using it to vote safely.
When did Trump switch to standup comedy? Hiring Trump and the the GOP to look after the little people is like hiring Colonel Sanders to guard the chickens

Whether or not you placed your singular vote for Hillary Clinton, you used your significant platform to disparage her (“Hillary Clinton is despicable but Trump is worse.”)  It is actions like that that brought us here so maybe best not to repeat it.

Yeh right. Trump can’t even string together a coherent sentence, never mind that he knows absolutely nothing about governance and American government.
Why shouldn’t the friggin government bail out the states to save teachers, firemen, schools, etc? Trump and the GOP caused this unprecedented death and economic destruction by their own lies, inaction and negligence.
Mr. Graham, If Trump did his job and the GOP did their friggin job of holding him accountable, 1200 Americans wouldn’t be dying daily from a disease causing an economy in free fall.. .
Here’s an official DJT Campaign website where you can request a free yard sign from the Trump campaign (and waste their campaign finance $$$).    I’m going to paint over mine and use it so I’m not wasting it.
Oh yes!!! No doubt at all about the crimes he has committed and can not be punished is a travesty. His wife MO now claims Trump has caused her depression?
Experts say that over 300,000 Americans will die by the November 3rd election, all while Trump does absoloutely nothing to educate his base, make more PPE, and develop a federal testing and tracing program. And he insisted on opening up too soon. Negligent homicide!
Trump’s idea of being president is tweeting, watching Fox &amp; Friends and doing nothing but lie, while 1200 Americans die daily. Incompetent loser.

Trump is a pathological liar, who is incapable of speaking the truth, or apparently listening to the experts in order to save American lives.
Michelle Obama has stated that she suffers from a low grade depression because of racism and what Trump’s presidency has done to our country.   We hear you Michelle and we all feel your pain.
Love it.... and if I were Biden,  I'd say "Judas...because without him, Jesus wouldn't have died for our sins" (then turn his head toward Trump and....wink).
Because Trump is our president and he refuses to listen to scientists and experts, and is dumb as a stone. 160,000 and counting...
It is all about Trump. To hell with the lives of Americans, our democracy or America’s place in the world.
The weak and immoral Republicans have hitched their wagon to Trump, and accordingly can never be trusted. They placed party above country and that must never be forgotten.
That and the fact that he says he likes them very much and then proceeds to throw them under the Trump bus
Everything is about Trump
I seem to recall that the NRA laundered money from Russia into Trump's campaign 🤔
Just anything blame it on Donald Trump? Find a new excuse to blame. It was BH. Obama who actually divided the entire country with his hatred for Our President. The lefties did all of this~~ #Trump2020 #KAG #MAGA
I think the real question should be - is Melania upset with how badly Trump is treating Americans and America, after all 160,000 Americans are dead and our economy and democracy are in shambles, because of his corruption and ineptitude.
This is really not a great argument considering Trump is clearly falling to pieces, mentally, right now
Watch the Jonathan Swan interview with Trump and you will know why 160,000 innocent Americans are dead.
Trump goes on TV and Twitter and speaks conspiracy theories, lies and basically BS. He has to go. He is a threat to our lives, our national security, morality, the rule of law and the truth. Pathological nutbag. #TrumpIsANutbag
Trump goes on national tv and tells the world that the Lebanon explosion was perhaps an attack. Trump is a moron.
Trump is the lowest point in American history. 1400 Americans died yesterday, while other westernized countries had maybe 1 or 7 deaths. Trump’s incompetence kills.
1400 innocent Americans died yesterday because of Trump’s incompetence, and we are still in coronavirus stage 1. Stage 2 will begin this November.
Trump is not only crazy, inept, corrupt and a pathological liar, but is incredibly ignorant. Not a good combination for the most powerful leader in the world, and that is why 160,000 Americans are dead, which is like 20 times worse than any other country on Earth. #TrumpGenocide
Trump had his British Ambassador try to get the British Open moved to his club in Scotland, so he could make a killing, no pun intended.
Trump is an international joke. It would be funny if 160,000 innocent Americans weren’t dead, and the American economy wasn’t in free fall.   Everything Trump touches, he destroys. #ItIsWhatItIs
It’s hilarious he blanes Trump.  Look closer to home.
All thanks to Donald Trump’s war on scientists in general, and anyone who makes him look stupid and inept specifically...
Trump is so incompetent and unsympathetic that when faced with the deaths of over 156,000 innocent Americans he says “it is what it is”. Yes, it is what it is because he is inept and did nothing to protect us from the very beginning. #ItIsWhatItIs
Trump is attacking the US Postal Service because Russia can hack into state elections electronically, but they can’t hack mail-in-voting.
Trump wants the Treasury to take a cut of the Tik Tok sale?? Trump is insane and will say anything to get back at the company whose teenage participants made a fool out of him and his campaign.
He was an FBI informant.  The FBI used him to hunt bigger game.  But Trump attacked the US intelligence community and undermined national security.   All bets are off.

is right Everybody hates Trump
Let’s not deflect.  The buck stops at the top.  It is Trump’s responsibility to hire the right people and establish the right environment in which then and he can succeed.
JT Lewis is OBSESSED with Trump. Dude, it’s seriously creepy how you reply immediately to every tweet. Also, do you have any thoughts of your own?
deserves a prize - not just for the exposure of trump's ridiculous incompetence, but for the saintlike patience he exhibited in interviewing this ridiculous child.  JFC.
Shut up. This isn’t China. He was having an interview &amp; he disagreed because Trump is cherry picking bs stats. It amazes me how trump followers talk about “USA” &amp; “muh rights” but they want this guy to be a dictator. I don’t get it.
Hillary was absolutely right about Trump but many refused to listen, because she is a woman and they just didn’t like her.   156,000 dead Americans and counting.
Okay, I admit it's hilarious that they somehow persuaded Trump to sit on a footstool for this interview
I think my favorite part of this is the tiny ottoman that Trump is perched on, like he's a second-grader asking his dad for help with fractions
If that is when Trump is at his best, I would really hate to see him the rest of the time...
Trump says Covid is under control and they have done everything possible to control it. Then where the hell is our federal testing and tracing programs, why is there still not enough PPE, and why are we losing over 1,000 people day? And “It is what it is” is not a suitable reply.
I couldn’t watch the full Axios interview with Trump because he is so full of magical thinking and revisionist history. He is very, very sick and we are dying because of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Trump is laying the foundation to challenge the outcome of this upcoming election. He is a monster, an authoritarian who demeans the very foundation of our democracy - the right to vote, all while killing thousands with his negligence. #Biden
Could anyone be so incredibly stupid? Trump just doubles down and tries to bully this reporter every time he is proven wrong. Moron.
South Korea has 54,000,000 people and 300 Covid-19 deaths. Under Trump, we have 330,000,000 people and 155,000 deaths. Do the math - Trump’s incompetence is killing us and it never needed to happened, but Trump says “it is what it is”.
Trump didn’t care about coronavirus deaths because originally they affected only the blue states. He then tried to make the governors solely responsible so he could escape responsibility for the needless deaths of tens of thousands. Trump is grossly incompetent and a sick liar.
A president takes an oath to protect Americans. Trump refused to listen to our scientists and experts, perpetrated lies and basically did nothing, absolutely nothing against the coronavirus. Yesterday other countries had 0 or 7 deaths - the US had over 1,200. Trump is killing us.
Donald Trump is so small. He is tiny. John Lewis didn’t attend George W. Bush’s inaugation because he didn’t think his election was legitimate. But who spoke at Lewis’ funeral - George W. Bush.
We had over 1,200 deaths from Covid yesterday. Other countries had 0 or 1 or 7. Presidential incompetence has killed so many of us, and all Trump does is lie. #Biden2020 #Biden
I can’t watch Trump’s press conferences. He is too stupid and just lies. It’s ridiculous. Plus NY is investigating his fraud, tax evasion and illegal payments to a porn star he had an affair with. This is on top of the fact he does whatever Putin wants and was impeached. Crazy.
If anyone still supports Trump they are either spineless, a traitor, an imbecile or all three.
This is why I am willing to walk through clouds of Covid to vote against this wicked sociopath..  How Trump could steal the election.
Trump has seen his approval rating from white voters with a college degree decrease all the way down to 29%. Way to go Trump!
Reports of late mail due to Trump’s new Post Master General, who is a big GOP donor, and is on a mission to disenfranchise voters who will vote against Trump. Congress must protect the USPS.
With how frequently Trump is throwing around executive orders, where are all the calls from the Republicans of over reach.  If I recall they were talking about King Obama due to executive order.  Another double standard?
Deutsche Bank has opened an internal investigation into the longtime personal banker of President Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, over a 2013 real estate transaction between the banker and a company part-owned by Mr. Kushner.
Now now. I’m sure there really are 100 people or so out of the 7mm+ people in the Bay Area that support Trump.
Fun fact: Teens use Tic Tok to organize effort to disrupt Trump campaign rallies by applying for tickets and not attending.  Empty venue embarrassed Trump resulting in firing his campaign chairman.
Trump has decimated many of the institutions we relay on to keep us safe and run our country. Now he is destroying our postal service because he thinks that will serve him when he attacks the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Congress must act!!!!!!!
We all know that Trump is a traitor, so stop - not to mention that his negligence killed 158,000 of us and is destroying our jobs and economy.
This isn’t about China anymore - it’s about Trump’s disastrous response and performance on the coronavirus. His negligence kills.
Trump is so incompetent and crazy that he sabotaged his re- election every step of the way, and can’t understand why America loves Fauci and hates him.   America loves Fauci because he is honest, he cares, is competent and is trying to save Americans - the antithesis of Trump.
Trump only knows how to implement chaos and destruction, which is so great for Putin. Thanks MAGA - your allegiance to a corrupt, traitorous madman has killed thousands, destroyed American democracy and so much more.
1,000 Americans are dying from Covid-19 every day, yet Trump ignores this reality and instead focuses on racist monuments, his wall, innocent protesters, locking up immigrant children, and taking healthcare away from many millions of Americans. Monster isn’t too strong a word.
It is going to take us a generation to rebuild what the Trump admin has destroyed.
Yeah, very convenient &amp; believable, lol. Btw- who gives a shit about their “falling out”. They were buddies &amp; it’s on record. Trump was accused of rape in the 90’s. What, that goes away because he had a falling out with his pedo friend?
No, no, no.  Bad idea. Boring America = Status Quo America. As much as we need to fix all the stuff Trump broke, where we were wasn't exactly the greatest. We need to move beyond that. To be better. And, that process should NOT be "boring".
Literally every word you typed was just a figment of your imagination. Your hashtag is hilarious 😆 Trump is QUOTED talking about how Epstein liked “beautiful woman just like me” &amp; they CLEARLY were friends. #dontbedelusional
Biden versus Trump. Some speculate that the future of the republic hinges on the outcome of the next election. But for smart investors it doesn't really matter who wins.
Trump's outrageous behavior warrants more scorn than he gets

China PANICS After Trump Announces Total Ban On TikTok, Cold War Is Esca...  via
Trump is trying to ban TicTok because he is mad the kids used it as a vehicle to make his Tulsa Rally a laughing stock.   A deadly laughing stock - just ask Herman Caine.
Trump doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He refused to implement a national testing program that was developed because, at that time, Covid was primarily killing citizens in blue states that didn’t vote for him in 2016.   Murderer.
People hate Trump because his negligence and lies are virtually killing them.
Barr is a sinister and corrupted traitor who has aligned himself with the most incompetent and corrupt president in American history. Remember that when he releases the Durham report - like Trump, Barr will do anything to stay in power.
Can’t believe Donald Trump is banning that one Ke$ha song smh
Trump and Kushner decided not to implement a federal testing program because at that time,  only blue states were being affected by Covid, and they really didn’t care if Democrats died.   Trump and Kushner should be jailed for the rest of their lives. Murderers!

Obviously, we have too many death certificates. If we didn’t actually acknowledge people were dead, we would have fewer deaths. People are just trying to make tRump look bad with these overrated death certificates.
Banning tik tok might be the last straw for young people to vote. This could get ugly for Trump. #tiktokban
Trump killed Americans for political gain (his administration’s handling of Covid). You haven’t done anything like that. You love America he only loves himself. Let’s give him 20 to life in a cell with his favorite person.
Seriously what is your problem? Does it look like protesting outdoors with most wearing masks is in alignment with being inside a closed church? He is a public health expert so stop attacking him like tRump cause he is more popular than that clown!!
Ignore TANA.  That person is batshit crazy.  They think Democrats created the vurus to make Trump look bad...as if Trump needs help looking bad.  That's the one thing Trump is good at...looking bad.
Great explanation of Trump logic
It seems every Trump supporter is low on intelligence.   Hydroxychloroquin is approved for specific indications, like malaria and lupus.  It is not approved for Covid.  And that demon semen Doctor has beliefs that are ridiculous and it's certainly not racist to say so.
Dershowitz switched sides.  You're not paying attention.   Obama and Epstein have zero connections,  unlike Trump and Epstein and Trump and Maxwell.  Face it, your guy is going down
People love to say F Trump because they have NO PROOF that he is racist, sexist,homophobic, xenophobic or anything else. All he has done is be a great president and kept promises.  Trump creates jobs, protects borders, honors countrymen. Trump’s a Patriot &amp;loves America☘️❤️🇺🇸🤦‍♂️
Remember when Trump said the 15 cases of coronavirus would go down to nothing by the end of the week? Well now we are losing 1,000 Americans daily, all because of Trump’s lies and negligence. #TrumpsGenocide
South treated as racist losers?  Most these men did not own slaves and fought for states rights.  They were called Democrats and they were the party of cessation. Lincoln and Republican Party fought to keep the Union in tact, much like Trump now. Base names were an olive branch.
We should name one of the bases Fort Donald J. Trump after the greatest US president ever!!!👍😀🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump would be envious that the corpse is getting all the attention
I like Obama...W was the 2nd worst President in history,  after Trump
Trump is to blame for Herman Cain’s death because he insisted on having his stupid Tulsa rally, and gave people a hard time about wearing a life-saving mask.   Trump’s ignorance and narcissism kills.
Life in Trump and Jared Kushner’s America!
Trump knows he is in trouble which is why he is doubling down on his fake claims of massive fraud through mail in voting. He is also suing Oregon for their program, and his forcing his newly appointed Post Office General to slow down and  dismantle operations. Trump is a monster.
And only about tRUmp
Um, so it turns out that Trump has decided to ignore her and stay , since he gets to believe he's somehow winning if he attacks his own citizens
Is it to much to ask that we have 1 day without some fakakta tweet from Trump that consumes the day?   Asking for a friend
Trump-cession
It is a shame that Herman Cain chose not to wear a face mask at Trump's Tulsa rally.  If he had, he might still be alive today -- and he would have driven a conversation that might have saved many more people.
They will think Democrats made the virus to make Trump look bad and accuse Democrats of murder
That’s kind of a weird reaction considering that you agreed with her and just ripped into her. She’s commenting negatively against Trump because he’s trying to dismantle the post office.
You realize of course by not voting for either man, you are giving a vote to Trump!
Trump has made not only America weaker, but our allies as well. He is a fool, a Russian asset and a disgrace to all Americans and the world.

One has to wonder if you are stalling on purpose so Trump can come in and look like the hero.
Trump is a racist and more old school. He panders to “voting blocs” with falsehoods and has abandoned American values. He doesn’t question but just supports a White Supremacist Agenda. Correct, Ali?
Russia is helping Trump.  Trump is assaulting China because they said no.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:

Trump went to Penn undergrad.  Wharton is the business school.  He never got a graduate degree.  I heard that he never went to class so, pipe down.
Coverage of pre-existing conditions is a cornerstone of the ACA (Obamacare). This is not a new thing you are offering. One again TRUMP LIES.  #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks  #PreExistingConditions #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpFailsAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

Trump is a White Supremacist racist. Golf club members too.  Trump doesn’t care about America. He cares about his privileged life and fragile ego.
The corruption is so complete. I’m not sure they can be stopped in their relentless drive to subvert the election - lie in Congress - openly use RU propaganda - destroy the USPS - refuse aid to Dem states hoping we will die...  To get trump re-elected. It’s their final solution.
Except that Obamacare already did this and Trump is a fucking moron
This story will not go away, despite the indifference of major news outlets. It will come back to bite Trump, who has already begun blaming it on his foreign policy and national security people. Pompeo realizes that Trump will throw him under the bus before taking responsibility.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:

Your opinion, without evidence, is that Trump told a joke. My opinion, with evidence, is that Ashcraft is mentally unstable individual who made up story.  Remember when I was talking about hypocrisy earlier?

Ironic that the ACA afforded us that right and Trump is trying to now claim it as his, even though he has been and is trying to reverse it!  #WeAreNotLemmings
Trump said, “This has never been done before,” when talking about pre-existing conditions. He should be in a rubber room.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:
Biden is no better than Trump.

Trump is 100% right. The media are supposed to remain object and practice journalistic integrity. The media has become the enemy of truth &amp; the American public. CNN was never part if the media, it's just a propaganda outfit. CNN is ignored by the American public.

Every time Trump calls COVID-19 the China Virus, it demeans my value as an American
An appropriate critique of ‘The Left’ is the unwilling nature to acknowledge any failures of democrats. Neoliberal Market Based ideology of the human condition is quite common. Trump derangement syndrome is a comfortable consequence for most. When we accept that, we can move on.
To be fair, Trump is the worst president at everything.
Ummm, he technically did spit on a child’s face, along with assaulted the child by grabbing his hand, taking his mask off and then continued to assault an employee who tried to stop him! 🙄 Guy was drunk off his rocker with no shoes on. Go figure he’s a Trump supporter. 🦇💩🤪
Maybe Trump hogs the umbrella so rain won’t expose the 666 mark under his hair fluff.
Or what if it's a backdoor way for them to oppose Trump? They can't openly come out against him, but they are able to weaken him by opposing any covid bailouts
Also, the morality piece of it is a matter of degrees. They could have not taken on the work if they wanted to take a moral stand against Trump values. There are plenty of law firms in the world.

You’ve been brainwashed. The last 3 weeks everything has shifted. Biden is losing trust with voters on every issue and hasn’t had ONE live interview where he didn’t say something horrible. Trump meanwhile has the polls moving in his favor and the debates still to come.

The democrats in congress have always said "oh, Trump wants to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions." The President NEVER said that, in fact has said multiple times that he wanted to KEEP pre-existing coverage. Now he's proven it at least, even if it's not needed yet.
Then you were awaiting a happy outcome.  Now, not so sure.  And even with our happy Trump defeat outcome we will still have lost hundreds of thousand of cherished lives.  Such sadness.

Trump to hold news conference after coronavirus stimulus talks fall apart
Keep telling yourself that. People still have not gotten used to getting screwed on their coverage + rates. Do we really have to have this debate again? Although President Trump taking away the mandate DID help. But it also made it more financially unsustainable.
Imagine if, due to their absolute allergy to popular and sensible policy, Trump end-runs the Dems on this and healthcare in the next few months by announcing a bunch of good new giveaways. GOP would probably finance it if it gurantees them permanent SCOTUS maj, which it would
The man has lost his mind.  Why hasn't anyone invoked the 25th Amendment?  Trump is unfit to be President.  We all know it's going to be a sh*t show come Nov. 3rd.
No, the ACA already did exactly what this EO is saying. What Trump is doing here is making it look like he’s introducing something new to take credit for something that already exists.
This is insane - panicked Republicans saying Trump needs to attack Biden; they got here by doing nothing to help people, just attacking people. Their endless attacks are the problem.
The fact that it's taken 40 years and President* Trump for smart, well-educated Republicans to start abandoning the party, when Lee Atwater said this in 1981, tells you all you need to know about normalization and privilege.

And then, of course, there is the inhospitable way trump treats immigrants both legal and illegal and the poor. Just politics you might say? I would answer that Biden’s stance on abortion is also just politics .
Moreover, Biden neither renounced nor denounced his faith with his political position. One could well argue that Trump’s lack of love, compassion, mercy, humility and grace most assuredly is against the teachings of Jesus and the will of God.

Herman Cain attended the June 20 Tulsa Rally where no one was required to wear masks. He was diagnosed June 29. Hospitalized July 2. Now dead. No one should blame trump for this plague . But the death of Cain, and others at that rally, create a blood trail straight to trump.
We need to get rid of Trump immediately
I’m sure thousands of doctors and researchers are letting people die because they are part of the deep state and “want to hurt trump.” Or maybe there have been conflicting studies . But hey, what do I know. I’m just a journalist that does research .
So Herman Cain threw away the remaining years of his life attempting to ingratiate himself to Trump buy attending a rally without a mask during a pandemic.  I bet he’ll never do that again. 😒  #HermanCain #ShuckyDucky
Website ranking - Donald Trump vs Joe Biden - Who's website gets more traffic? Who's winning?  . . #trump2020 #biden2020
President Trump on Thursday suggested a “delay” to the November election, claiming a shift to mail-in voting would make it the most “fraudulent election in history.”
website ranking research underway for trump vs biden-
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years –- via starkly different paths.
The Trump administration and Oregon leaders declared victory after it was announced that U.S. agents guarding a federal courthouse during violent demonstrations in Portland will pull back"Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
Donald Trump is a voluptuous Chinese grandma
Trump also made a mayor announcement stating that he has just discovered the wheel, saying “ that’s a really big thing, nobody ever did before”.

The stock market has made a lot of people very rich during Trump’s 1st term who bought stocks guided by inside information, or the value added to Corp stock from the 2 $trillion given to them, which was suppose to filter down to all &amp; didn’t!
... So there is this 10 year old law called the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare." And it requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. In other words, there is already a law that does what this order "does."  And Donald Trump has been trying to kill it for years
You like this Trump guy? Give me one reason why
Greatest President in History. Trump deserves to be on Mt Rushmore.
So Donald Trump is the main reason that AmeriKKKa is the way it is now? Is that what you're trying to say?
This is completely unacceptable and a direct move by Trump to suppress votes
Trump is is so dumb.  The only person Kanye West would pull votes away from is Trump.  Voters could be excused for confusing two different severely mentally ill candidates.

More gaslighting bullshit.  For the rubes:  this is ALREADY law. Ok?  It’s part of....wait for it...Obamacare.  And trump’s lawyers have been in court trying to KILL IT   MAGA: you are being played
So apparently TikTok is ending on me and my baby sisters birthday on 09-20 thanks to trump for amazing freaking birthday......NOT.....😭🤯🤬
Um... a lot of models start in their early teens. It's one of the most exploitative aspects of an exploitative industry, and often allows sex traffickers to operate in the open, like Epstein and Trump.

Saying they're a threat to civilization ... it's nonsense. Doc Feathersword is a ridiculous person.  But we know'from history that a ridiculous person can conjure up a nonsense panics, and be dangerous. McCarthy for one.  Trump, obviously.  Small, damaged, ridiculous.
Trump’s troops are a threat to American lives and American freedom.
You are running ads right now telling people to learn about the real Trump from people including Herman Cain. The guy who died cause he went to a Trump rally.   Not surprised that you're advertising a dead man praising Trump. Trump still thinks Fredrick Douglas is alive.
Where is  emergency injunction effort, that this executive act was arbitrary, capricious and intended to serve the felonious objective of interfering with an election? Stop rolling over when Trump breaks the law. Thwart his cheating. If you want a fair election.
I can’t get enough of all these Trump supporters who tell us how his dumb comments must be interpreted.
The fact that it's taken 40 years and President* Trump for smart, well-educated Republicans to start abandoning the party, when Lee Atwater said this in 1981, tells you all you need to know about normalization and privilege.
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Trump sees his re-election slipping away. His shitty base is not large enough, he needs more voters.
I do not think Donald Trump has ever forgiven anyone who “trespasses” against him. Nor has he ever “turned the other cheek.”
This is part of the strategy by Trump, his enablers, and #MoscowMitch to gradually turn over power from Congress to Trump so that he rules by executive order. They can't win a free and fair election, but they will at any cost preserve white GOP rule through a mafia oligarchy.
do u realize that people who just graduated college started college with the trump election and ended with a pandemic
Trump is disgusting. Such a piece of garbage. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden2020Landslide #DumpTrump2020
We have that under the ACA, which Trump and GOP have been desperately trying to destroy. This is only news for uninformed people who buy your 🐂💩.
They both do, as does just about every white American. But nothing like the problem Trump and GOP have
It's a state that is custom made for the Bernie/Trump style of 'tear it all down and then build it up again with a whole bunch of pieces missing' kind of rhetoric.
👿Trump can't stop lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of rape: Judge
What's the deal with the trump/drug bill that he won't let anyone see? He says drug companies have to see him by Aug. 25 to make a deal with him... with HIM....
Actually, you’re running on empty, creating straw men because Trump has nothing to show for 3 and half years in office except the destruction of the US
I wish Joe Biden (and Trump for that matter) was held to the same standard for their non consensual romantic relationships as Alex Morse is being held to for consensual relationships

Says more about you than anything else
You make fun of disadvantaged folks and feel good about it?
Yes, exactly! #MoscowMitch blocks everything, relishing his "Grim Reaper" persona, so Trump has an excuse to rule by executive order. Start with little things, even existing laws, to normalize the idea that of course all laws come from the president... presto, GOP minority rule.
This isn't crazy, it's deliberate. McConnell obstructs everything in the Senate. Trump, with support from Barr and John Yoo, rolls out more and more EOs to cover things that are already law as well as things that aren't. They can't win a fair election, so oligarchy it is.
You’re funny and likely right. Now explain the George Conway behind the anti-Trump Lincoln Project married to KellyAnn Conway, the spin artist for Trump? Are they both laughing at us all at night and well paid by the political machinations as our democracy spins into disarray?
It's not bullshit, he literally said it on Wednesday, just two days ago, on Fox News:
Even Trump supports extending the Eviction Moratorium through the end of the year. Here in Mass., our Eviction Moratorium is in place through Oct. 17, but we need the #COVID19 Housing Stability Act to ensure protections for the duration of the emergency.
We're fighting both efforts. Support  Safe social media.  Russia is trying to ‘denigrate’ Biden while China prefers ‘unpredictable’ Trump not be reelected, senior U.S. intelligence official says
I hate to say this but I fear a simplistic cost/benefit analysis may be at work. The old may not survive but even if they do their productivity will be low. Many younger folks may get sick but survive and in the long run provide more output.  Trump lives even in MA.
Trump is literally a fascist
The Trump Administration is arguing before the Supreme Court to strike down the law, which requires coverage of pre-existing conditions.
Disgusting #Russia is denigrating ⁦ for #Trump. Worse is ⁦ ⁦⁦⁦⁦⁦⁦ and ⁦ working with Russians who put bounties on Americans for Trump. #GOPComplicitTraitors
This shit would be cool if you weren't out here trying to make sure we get Trump for four more years
funny, I thought it was called the Trump Cabinet!
I knew it. I think I just heard that the postmaster general fired a bunch of top leader ship at the Postal Service. So now Trump is getting his way around the Postal Service. In addition Grassley and Johnson are doing Russia’s bidding. Heaven help us all
This is deliberate. #MoscowMitch keeps congress from doing anything. Trump begins to rule by executive order. John Yoo provides memos supporting it. They gradually expand executive rule until we have a de facto monarchy, or at least mafia oligarchy.
I speak more languages than Trump and am more educated. I went to excellent undergrad and graduate schools. I’m a published author. I’ve traveled extensively my whole life. You sound like an idiot defending what was probably a just an accident. Give it up.
Watching  EOs on TikTok and WeChat come into effect is like watching the splinternet happen before our eyes. Clear factions centered on the US, China, Russia and Europe are starting to develop.  Spoke w/ the ever-thoughtful
We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures ⁦
Why is the #Trump Campaign funding the #West campaign? Why?
The fucking funniest thing about Donald Trump's healthcare executive order reactivating literally the most important part of Obamacare is that it proves unequivocably that the only thing Donald Trump cared about was that Obama got credit for it.  Once a con man, always a con man.
Article 3 of the Constitution establishes the 3rd Branch of our Government, the (federal) Judiciary Branch. With regard to recourse, realistically all of us can/should Vote against GRAHAM in 2020 and against JOHNSON in 2022.  TRUMP must go this November &amp; all his Russian assets.
Like so much of #Trump's rhetoric, his claim that he won’t step down if he loses can be dismissed as ranting to fire up his base.  But it could also make us more attentive to the fact that, in a democracy, losing is actually complicated business.
Trump's election was not surprising to those who understand how the internet works,  reminds us. Paging  She was way ahead of most of us on this. #ASA2020
uber driver heard trump on the radio, huffed loudly, and popped in 'songs about jane' (cd!) I am beaming.
#Bedminster = Trump’s Spider Hole or if you prefer Hitler’s Bunker. We are finally winning on the Russian Front!!!!  Huzzah!  Or Heil Hitler.
If you wanna know why a certain class of Republicans are always trying to keep Trump around it's because he is making their wettest privatization dreams come true and this is ghastly
Trump needs to stop saying things that only make me want to vote for Biden
Unless she’s interviewing a Democrat or Never Trump grifter. Then it’s pure:
Fox wants to edit the speech so people can’t see how incoherent Trump is
It wouldn't be a Trump press conference without Trump taking credit for something Obama came up with. #preexistingconditions
Much better. I read this book right after tRUmp was elected. The similarities are chilling.
It’s not bewildering. Falwell has always been a grifter and a player. Like Trump.
So I guess Trump's big health care plan reveal is that he's issuing an executive order to command insurers to do something that they're already required to do by the law he keeps trying to repeal
I had lots of people (including my own brother) who told me “of course I didn’t vote for Trump.” That didn’t mean they voted for Hillary, and  it was a few years before I realized they let me assume they voted for Hillary when they actually voted 3rd party or write in.
Why caint Merkuns fly to Yurp? Cuzza #Trump’s failed response ta the Rona.
Wow. You really ARE brainwashed by FOX. Trump is the crook. He used his charity to make money, which is why the NY AttyGeneral shut it down. Just like she (a black woman) will do with the NRA.

Nero doesn’t have anything on Trump. Trump continues to fiddle away while the US burns. There’s not a single ounce of empathy for the people of the United States. This entire pandemic could have been mitigated had the moron in chief listen to the scientists. God help us all.
When I say even in these deep blue state suburbs, Trumpers are still believers, I am not at all implying Trump would win this state.   That’s ridiculous.  What I’m saying is I don’t trust white voters not to vote for him.
Those are the Republicans under Trump. The previous Republicans like Bush would never stoop to that level.
That’s why I have 13 followers. Seems like people should like it more when I get drunk and say I hate Trump or when I get drunk and say things about the Celtics.
Think the natural conclusion is until I see a long form birth certificate Trump is actually a secret Indian.
I would love for a no nonsense lesbian to be the one to take down Trump
They love being in power &amp; don’t give a damn about most Americans, our democracy or constitution.If they are trying to do away with voter rights &amp;oversight of the election,why would they have a problem with Russian help.They want Trump re-elected any way possible,then remove him?
Trump/ vs vets: “Undetonated mines lie in wait for generations, indiscriminate in their destruction, unable to tell friend from foe, child from adult. They simply kill. This is what Donald Trump wants us to unleash on the world. This is who he is.”

So sad... This governor and Trump are like identical twins in so many ways… So much blood on both of their hands
Remember how long it took the media to call Trump a racist? “He did a racist like thing”- Dems did this too.
Trump would eat the Easter Bunny, call the bearded guy “Fat Santa” and harass the Tooth Fairy.
A Trump hoax. All staged so Trump can throw out some money to boost him in the polls.

You are so right. This all feels staged. Trump wants to prevail. We are so lost.
Deep thoughts: sometimes I think Trump is secretly a progressive Democrat hell bent on destroying the GOP because only someone who hates the GOP could make the decisions Trump does.
The Republican Party has gone all in with Trump. Like Lindsey Graham said so prophetically, he has destroyed the Republican Party, and they deserve it. They do not deserve my vote, ever.
Last week #Trump hinted that he might not accept defeat at the polls come November... but his tactics raise important questions about what it means to lose in a democracy:
Russia Continues Interfering in Election to Help Trump, U.S. Intelligence Says  And complicit, spineless Republicans standing quietly by are repulsive!! Y'all, we've got to save America!
Biden knows more in his pinky, especially compared to incompetent Trump.  GOP empowers Trump cheating with Putin!!  Regan is rolling over in his grave!
Moscow Mitch empowers Trump cheating! 🤮
Mail in voting same as 1/4 absentee voting in 2016. GOP empowers Trump lies.
Biden knows more in his pinky, especially compared to incompetent Trump.  GOP cheating with Putin!!  Regan is rolling over in his grave!

Also, Trump has decided to stop collecting data for the Census one month early. The Census is absolutely critical. Please be sure you filled it out and ask everyone you know to do so the same:
It should be called the Trump virus.
IDK why I capitalized trump haha. On the note of supporting USPS, did you know they have a gift shop!? (I really didn't!)   Don't know how much it'll help, but I bought a dog costume for Ollie because why not!
This article in The Atlantic--"Trump Has Launched a Three-Pronged Attack on the Election"--highlights some of the challenges we'll be facing in November, but more importantly, it offers tangible solutions to prevent them. Check it out:
I know, I hope we can move towards universal mail in voting as a country (which would at the least require a funded USPS, sigh). Unfortunately for now it seems there's a precarious balance between fighting for universal vs TRUMP questioning legitimacy of election
Meanwhile trump constructs an actual police state under your very nose.
Lmfao this is like the emails and messages sent to admin abt me from whack jobs trying to get me removed for supporting Trump but I'm the admin
On The Wendy Williams Show, when asked about their "favorite thing in common" with each other, Ivanka responds "real estate and golf", but loving father Trump answers "sex"
This news story has been consistently undersold, and presented as a set of disconnected stories.  Put it this way: In 2016, Trump encouraged and accepted Russian help.  In 2020, the GOP Congressional leadership is doing it too.
Is trump really process? I hope not.
How the fuck did we not have the capacity? What the hell was CPSD doing the last 6 months? And what does Trump have to do with this? A broken clock is right twice a day
Reagan was about as white supremacist as Trump, which is why 91% of African Americans voted for Mondale in 1984, so just put her down as yet another white supremacist
We are becoming a sad example of what can happen to a democracy when an unqualified authoritarian corrupt unstable man is somehow  will take time to recover after November but I look forward to an America that can be even better than before the Trump “era”.

Bottomline: the Republican Party doesn’t have the selfrespect to run their sorry candidate for president without the support of Putin/Russia. Biden will reject all interference. Trump asked for, received, benefitted from, and rewarded help in ‘16,can’t call out Putin to this day.
Antifa is a figment of Donald Trump's twisted imagination and those gullible enough to believe him.  No one should sit idly and be assaulted by police.  That time is #OVER.
The professor is not considering the silent majority who are not blind to the ATROCITIES BACKED by Democrats, and what is worse, NO PLANS to rebuild America, just demagogyc subsidies.Where the inflow of money will come? Mistery!
wonder if they're Russian
Trump will win. Americans see what is going on in this country. The majority is silent to avoid the insanity. Once in the voting booth they will do the only thing.

You were wrong for decades. The modern GOP has never stood for fiscal responsibility or family values. You sacrificed families for tax cuts for the wealthy for decades using #race as a #dogwhistle to stoke fear for votes, Trump was a natural result.  I'm glad you finally #WokeUp.
What makes this even crazier is this.  Trump folks believe Kanye will siphon younger, disaffected black voters away from Biden.  But aren't these EXACTLY the voters they are trying to disenfranchise "with surgical precision."  You can't siphon voters you are blocking from voting.
Trump is the man. Also the Greatest President in History.
You have absolutely no idea what Marxism, Communism &amp; the “Left”  see moderate economic &amp; social policies as extreme.That is so far from the truth &amp; a ploy extremist right wing Republicans use to try &amp; scare voters into submission. Dementia? Look at Trump.
Trump's failure of leadership is an example of what happens when your father figure is an ex-Klansmen.  Given all we're dealing w/ right now, the state of rap videos should be very low on the #priorities of a congressional candidate but we hear the #RacistDogWhistle your blowing.
The single-minded purpose of Trump and all the antigovernment zealots like  for 4? 10? years has been to destroy the ACA, the only law that covers preconditions, and to wage war on Medicaid, which serves vets:
Or perhaps our #FailureInChief could've taken Covid19 seriously &amp; developed a comprehensive national strategy that didn't turn prisons into viral hot-spots.  This is a direct result Trump's inaction &amp; a gross example of your use of #DogWhistle politics.  This is #WillieHorton2020

The violence in Seattle &amp; other cities can be traced to #Trump undoing the policies designed to drive #PoliceAccountability by Eric Holder  DOJ.   Until we address #PoliceBrutality and #racism in police departments, we will see the cycle of protests then violence repeat.
After my experience today in suburban blue ass Massachusetts, I want to reiterate, I don’t trust white voters.  These fuckers are still looking to vote for Trump.  It will take all of us, every single possible vote, to end this.
Must say I don't care if Trump golfs, mispronounces words, or has an orange face. I don't care if Dinesh or Rudy or the kiddos tweet idiotic stuff. I do care about destructive policies in every nook and cranny of this govt, and get no attention bc they bait us w/ trivialities.

In our latest Today's Market Takeaways, Vice President Steve Johnson reviews the highlights of this week's market and economic news, including earnings and President Trump's executive order to ban #TikTok and #WeChat in the U.S.
Never forget the harm an unqualified, undistinguished Trump mini-mini-me like  can do:
If Donald Trump succeeds in banning TikTok, there are four apps that seem to be lined up to take its place, each with different audiences, features, and challenges. Here’s a rundown of them.
John Lewis Was the Anti-Trump  The president doesn’t seem to know what democracy is; the congressman embodied it
It was awful.  Two guys behind the counter and this older woman yucking it up about how old Biden is.  They called him Sleepy Joe, I said at least he’s not racist Trump.  Imagine thinking your customers want to hear that crap.
Just over three months before we correct the mistake of a lifetime and send Trump packing.
I just got in an altercation with some Trump scums at the liquor store.
Seth- anyone that believes a lick of junior's book already drank the koolaid. Intelligent people avoid crap like that- does anyone really believe any Trump other than Mary can write? I hope they have to deal with litigation for libel ASAP.

🎶 88 days til we beat donald trump  88 days to beat trump stay up to the task and wear a damn mask 87 days til we beat donald trump! 🎶
Tik-Tok is under attack because a bunch of teens used it to make the Trump campaign look like the jackasses that they are. Nothing to do with China or anything else. That's just an excuse. Is there really anything to discuss here?
If it turns out that Trump does not like their bill after all, then all of these ugly tactics and all their propaganda was based on a LIE. They have built big momentum for this bill amongst their base, and they are afraid to lose all of it if the bill hits the Trump brick wall.
.  hates this news because it wrecks their main argument for a zero-sum bill (#s386). they believed that Trump won't increase GCs, and that is the only way for them even if it harms other immigrants. They waged an ugly war against Durbin under this pretext.
"You are not my superior now..." LOL Who are you trying to convince, me or yourself, boomer? Haha One more time, Trump said that as POTUS he has "total authority." If you have a problem with that fact, take it up with him, sport.
Incorrect. Donald J. Trump is the worst on foreign policy, period.   Add, Domestic Policy, The Rule of Law, Public Policy, Human Rights, Economic Policy and Unethical/Illegal behavior to the list.
So emotional. Hahaha Trump said he has "total authority" as president, but you're butthurt that he's been 'accused' of being tyrannical. Um... you didn't think this one through, champ.
Nice try. LOL No deflection can change the fact that Trump *said himself* that he has "total authority" as president. He said what he said. Focus.

So to sum up this idiot in order of what he’s said: -Most English speaking people say it this way -Well, outside of the US -And actually I mean across South Asia -Listen, Trump is smarter than you because he’s rich and you’re not
Where Do Republicans Go From Here?

I find the fact that anyone, but especially in the context of Trump, would find the fact of name recognition enviable as a thing in itself extremely telling
You presume that, because I criticize Biden, I support Trump?!? 🤣🤣🤣  Please try to widen your scope a little bit!!!  I DESPISE DONALD JOHN TRUMP AND WISH FOR HIM TO BE BANISHED FROM SOCIETY  …which is why I'm so angry at the DNC for pushing Biden as the nominee!!!
I “travelled” to Bucharest once. I was changing planes. Had a coffee in a very massive, very weird subterranean lounge, alone but for an ancient woman vacuuming the largest rug I’ve ever seen.   Trump‘s ‘travels’ are the rich person’s version of that.
Correction: Trump only cares about undermining National Security by encouraging our adversaries to interfere in our elections or to ignore the deaths of our soldiers. He does NOT give one damn about National Security and none of this is in any way aimed at properly handling China
Trump, the cosmopolitan. That’s a new wrinkle
Proud to be a card carrying member of the  and hoping to see them sue this Administration. Reasonable debate over China is great, as would be Congressional action, not unilateral politicking aimed at boosting ratings before an election. Trump doesn’t care about NatSec at all
“It is what it is.”  -Donald Trump
I think you accidentally dropped some truth,   The fact of the matter is, Trump is a coastal elite.  He was born into wealth and went to Penn.  A man of the people he is not.  He doesn't care about average Americans, he just pretends to care on tv because it sells
Well, most "Not Trump" people will probably vote for Biden. So it's essentially the same thing.

Let’s dispense with the notion that Trump ever was the “jobs president” with a “stellar” economy. Compare his first 37 months (BEFORE Covid) to Obama’s last 37:    Obama     8,254,000    Trump       6,836,000 Check it out:

Let me violate the #NationalSecurityLaw and also my policy of not praising the Trump administration:  This is a smart, proportionate move and also the right thing to do. Carrie Lam deserves much worse but this will do for now.
The most revealing quote about why people vote for Trump was that one lady impacted negatively by the gov't shutdown in 2019 saying "he's not hurting who he's supposed to be hurting." It was never, ever about making life better for themselves or anyone else
I’m still not on, this Acct. belongs to my old car, she got on to talk cars, F1 and coffee, alas.... fuck trump.
To suggest that Black people who were not going to for Trump will suddenly vote for him because Biden said they are a monolith is insulting to the intelligence of Black people. Black people are capable of making political decisions beyond statements &amp; gaffes.
Sadly, I have. And I am in no way saying Biden is worse at this stuff than Trump. I am saying that Biden has never been a great public speaker, and has lately become a much WORSE public speaker. A hedgehog in a red hat would be better at public speaking than Trump!
Serious question. Do House Democrats have the legal right to immediately lock up those who ignore subpoenas? For example, all those who ignore them because Trump asked them to ignore? Or is this an urban legend?
There’s so much wrong w this but come on Trump voters - the elitism are glaring- and no he’s not a billionaire. Could have been but he failed.
Last week #Trump hinted that he might not accept defeat at the polls come November... but his tactics raise important questions about what it means to lose in a democracy:
OMG there's quite a difference between being a bully and being an intellectual 'force'. Geraldo - wow - what does trump have on him to ensure his suckupitis
Very tough question. Just started reading The Spendid and the Vile -Churchill and Britain during the Blitz.  Surviving Trump and the Covid is an act of national defiance for ourselves and those who succumb.
"President Trump’s irresponsible approach to nuclear weapons has increased, not decreased, the dangers of nuclear proliferation and nuclear war," said Matthew Bunn of  #nuclear
BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S NON RESPONSE TO COVID19  160,000 AMERICAN'S ARE DEAD.... BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S NON RESPONSE TO COVID19  160,000 AMERICAN'S ARE DEAD.... BECAUSE OF TRUMP'S NON RESPONSE TO COVID19  160,000 AMERICAN'S ARE  DEAD... NOVEMBER 3RD  GONE
Why did (and still do) I think this?   1. The social and economic geography of Pennsylvania seemed quite a bit more Trump friendly than Wisconsin, for a few reasons.   2. Wisconsin's higher elasticity and higher 3rd-party share in 2016.
Hey  ...let me remind you: Trump was IMPEACHED. And always will be.
Biden doesn't need to beat Trump when Trump is doing a fine job of beating himself.
There is a little boy whonis really trying to please the president. He just called the little mussolini "Donald J Trump"Some days all this craziness is just way too much! Can anyone see how bad it truly is? This Country is dying... everyday its worse! We are a few months away from complete &amp; total chaos! Wheres Trump? At his golf club for the wknd lying, misleading this nation as he  usually does!
if your best argument for opposing doing better is "but trump" then maybe think about how much you care about actually helping the world improve.

Sure dude...I’m sure Rachel Maddox is jealous of Donald Trump’s wealth.  I’m sure Anderson Cooper is so envious that he doesn’t have Donald Trump’s gold-plated, tacky condo.  Give me a break.  You are embarrassing yourself.
Because they're a political lobby, not a religious revival. They have a political agenda--get socially conservative judges appointed to federal courts--and Trump has given them Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and (in a putative second term) a conservative replacement for Ginsberg too. 1/
They made it so Trump looks like a competent leader. I won't stand for it.
Trump isn't one-tenth the human being that Bernie is. I've never, ever believed that your politics informs your character--that you must be a better person just because you and I are on the same side of the political fence.
Andy, why do you keep repeating "we could have prevented" over and over and over, unless you're trying to energize the progressives for the November election. Otherwise, it's pointless. Trump and the Senate GOP are NOT going to change the policy as long as he's in office.
Republicans Against Trump
They got completely outmaneuvered AND let Trump look like a competent leader. Fuck each and every person in the Democrat leadership.
Trump is going to speak at his golf club with his golf buddies as a cheering audience.  Why should any news organization cover this obvious trump rally?
Schumer wants to open the schools safely. Trump- The guidelines can’t be too strict. See the difference Donnie?
What could anyone in the Trump family know about military service
Trump wouldn’t rent to blacks or minorities for years and was sued numerous times,how hypocritical can yo get
He basically makes the point that he doesn’t like Trump because he’s boorish, but is good with everything else.
Trump’s economy. It’s the Democrat governed cities that have been also been that way for eight additional years under Obama. When was the last time he was in his old district of S.Chicago.
Who’s in offices on the 16th fl in Trump Tower?
I completely disagree, Trump is so anxious to make nice w/ N. Korea to make himself look good the sanctions if any will be minimal
the absolute fear I feel walking by myself? would never wish on anyone. Do I wish every trump bumper sticker could experience that for one second? Yes you fuckers have no idea what being afraid for your life because of who you are and how you think actually feels like!!!!
Thread by  You all know why Trump has now left the White House - being seen off by the entire WH staff before he traveled to Oe he won't be back for awhile - to go to his resort in Bedminster, NJ, right? Everybody focuses on SPYGATE SPYGAT…
Trump opens his mouth and lies just flow out.  Trump is a pathological liar and sociopath.   Great combination for a President
40 million unemployed.  The most since the Great Depression.   Trump is a disaster
Trump has murdered more Americans than died in the Vietnam and Korea wars COMBINED.
US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
It’s alright I’m here from the future we had a good run human race “good” lol fighting over skin color, resources, and political points. This is right before our election so trump was right it will be delayed.
That’s an unacceptable answer. Every President has tried to work w/N. Korea, but no other has been stupid enough to be so thoroughly played like Trump. Doesn’t it bother you that the World Leaders think he’s a joke? We used to be feared but not anymore
Who, exactly, is included in the "we?" I'm betting on Barr, Jared and Meadows. Not Trump because he simply calls his minions and says, "You 3, go gut the USPS. I don't care how, just do it." Crime bosses keep their hands clean.
As much as that sucks,it’s still better than Trump and they might pick better judges from top to bottom.
But Trump stated emphatically that He would fix it. Like Mexico will pay for the wall! Nope. His lying just kills me, at least those before him were smart enough not to make promises other than to try &amp; do what they said.
My fav Christian Trump thing is when he raw dogged (condomless sex) with Stormy Daniels while Melania was recovering from giving birth to Baron. What’s yours ?
Biden was accused ( after being VP for 8 yrs without being accused) &amp; there wasn’t any back up. Trump has 45 sexual harassment allegations against him &amp; a woman fighting to get his DNA prior to the election. Clinton’s allegations came out after he was elected, but not ok
Why does Trump &amp; the GOP hate Americans being able to pay rent, eat etc?
Was it really? N. Korea hasn’t stopped it’s Nuclear testing like Trump promised. Leaving the Climate Accord? Not so good. I haven’t done enough research on Iran to offer an opinion yet.
Trump says vaccine available November 3rd.  Call the White House and ask for Donald Trump to order yours.
I think Trump should stay out of it. But he knows nothing about being presidential
It’s weird Geraldo would bring attention to Trump and him being friends and then pretend he wants to honestly interview Biden.
Thread by  It's #TIME Thread: #AmericanaRISING: A GLIMPSE INTO THE SHADOWS 02- DAGGERS ARE OUT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP Everyone is spg on what President Trump meant when he said the following= "This may be the last time you'll see me for awhile."…
This punk is really gonna make me do this?  has 1 more economics degree than this fool. And she doesn't pretend to be an expert on the environment, she listens to experts! That kid in the audience knows more than Trump on virology, but he didn't bring that up!
Not for nothing but honestly, who started the infantile name calling in the first place? That would be Trump. How’s that Presidential? I know they all do the point counter point but the political climate on both sides is way too divisive
If you're looking for solutions you also don't start by saying Biden doesn't believe in policies he has already released or that "moderate" democrats are responsible for things the GOP did. The main thrust seems to be that we have Trump because Democrats didn't stop the GOP.
You really don’t seem to be looking for a solution. If you’re out here blaming Democrats for the rise of Trump, you’re really not looking for a solution.
Helping the GOP. I remember what happened in 2016, I remember "progressives" saying HRC was just as bad as trump and couldn't be trusted with the court. HRC ran on the most progressive platform in history and "progressives" still weren't excited. You shot the hostage already
Most of my Republican friends have said Trump’s handling of  Covid killing over 160,000 Americans is deplorable, his scandals have made us the laughing stock of the world &amp; have apologized for voting for him.
Its not just Trump but Mitch and all of his followers
A thermonuclear bomb wouldn't force Trump to do anything.
I just realized  takes down tweets that are not pro Trump. Wow did not know they could do that!
We are only about 1% higher than Obama was at this point in his first term--three years after the crisis he was elected to manage.  Trump is about 6 months into this crisis and unemployment rate is dropping fast.
From Trump's supporters, "zzzz" is pretty much the reaction, all right. Until one of them catches it or one of their family members catches it.
Day 88: Trump's Cabinet has been contentious since the start, with many being ill-suited, ill-prepared, and/or outwardly hostile to their agencies. DeVoss even needed a Pence tiebreaker.  Of the 22 Cabinet positions, only 6 remain the same person from just 3.5 years ago.
Look, we get it. You know that COVID-19 is a political loser for Trump, so you're desperate to change the subject and have Americans think about something else. Sorry, no can do. Trump's failure with COVID-19 is the Number One issue for this election.

Trump has invented a lot of new words. Try the Pad Thigh.
So yeah, something is not right here. I’m not buying that they are generally all of a sudden outraged about death , but rather, they sense an opportunity to get Trump and are taking advantage of it.
First off, the original projections were AT LEAST one million.  We are not even 20% of the way to that bottom figure, so why isn’t Trump getting credit for saving so many lives?
There is just something not right, maybe even sinister, but I can’t quite put my finger on it, about the relentless blaming in the media of all the Covid deaths on Trump.
Sure! Trump is incoherent, but the GOP base has now largely adopted the old Pat Buchanan platform from 1992. Buchanan ran on an "America First" platform that included nativism, protectionism, isolationism (opposed the Gulf War), and maxing out on the culture war stuff. 1/
Yes it does. At least for president. I get you hate Trump. But never Trump = Biden is president.
President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of popular social media apps TikTok and WeChat on security grounds, a move China’s government criticized as “political manipulation.”
Which is the “ Trump Way” of doing things
What Trump ass kisser gayetz
Donald Trump is a Fake Person
A desperate move by the trump campaign.
Any chance at all that this trip was paid for by the Trump campaign? That includes secret service, aides, etc.
Donald Trump being referred to as a Man is a hoax
The sad thing is that we're probably better off without a national plan from Trump. At least this way, knowledgeable governors and mayors have been able to do some good in their areas. A national plan from Trump would read like Laura Ingraham wrote it.
Trump's supporters are just as much "THE PEOPLE" as you are. Your problem is that you just don't get that the rest of us do NOT want to take direction from you. Now what are you going to do about it?
That Trump is such a racist 🤦🏻
Except Trump won’t pay up. He’s a serial DEADBEAT
Trump is incapable of quoting any passage from the Bible. #BiblicalIdiot
Biden doesn’t want to debate Trump because he might lose. He won’t meet the challenge and lacks character Everyday, we are in debate or conflict with each other, our work, local politics. We are expected to show-up. Is that an example for your children.
Who knows? Maybe we'll get lucky and trump will get thrown down to hell too!
We’re all in a mess of the Republicans making. That won’t change on 1/20/21 no matter who is sworn in. Your Party is a dumpster fire, and they lit the match themselves. None of you can govern, nor do you care to. The GOP has been the party of trump since 1980.
You remind me of donald trump when you speak the gestures you make
Really? And yet the Trump property in NY rents offices to The largest Chinese Bank located on the 20th Floor of Trump Tower. Can you say CONFLICT?
And he's killed fewer people than trump.

From the time when this so called Christian signed up with Trump, I knew he was and is a hypocritical sycophant. He has done nothing since then to dissuade me.
Forced to play defense in states he led comfortably months ago, President Donald Trump set his sights on Ohio on Thursday in an attempt to reframe the centerpiece of his reelection pitch.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, an early advocate among Republicans of wearing masks and other pandemic precautions, tested positive Thursday for the coronavirus just ahead of a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.
They can go talk to Trump. I'll take a check if it's too hard to squeeze that much cash into a duffle bag.
I was a E Warren supporter.  Still am.  But I will get behind Biden to make sure trump does not get another term.  I'm fine with my self reflection.
Republican politicians do not know how to deal with the fact that the party's base prefers Trump over them. If they break with Trump, the base will abandon them and they'll be defeated anyway.
You are turning people away from Biden - people who will either not vote at all or who will vote for a 3rd party candidate. Both are votes for trump. I'm serious-how does that help? How does 4 more yrs of trump help your cause?
If Trump is re-elected and continues to botch the coronavirus threat, high-risk patients like me may die. Those are the stakes.

Day 89: In the first few months of his presidency Trump went on a deregulation spree, repealing rules, laws, or EOs that *inhales*: (1/5)  Prevented the dumping of mercury into waterways. Required oil companies to state where &amp; how they buy oil. Provided low-income ISP subsidies.
I think you're missing the point.  The point is: Democrats; stop courting the rural white Trump supporter, and start courting (or stop ignoring) the much more reliable Democratic voter that is the African-American vote, especially the African-American Woman.  Just ask Roy Moore.

One way would be to not pull a Gerald Ford. You want to erode trust further? Pull the typical "we need to move forward, not backwards" tripe after this level of dereliction, incompetence, and corruption.  Show the people actions have consequences.
We know all that already. But here we are, and Trump is still going to be President until next January at least. We'll all have to make do with what we've got to work with.
Joe Biden's Democratic presidential campaign has launched a new national ad focused on Black Americans, urging them to stand up to President Donald Trump the way their ancestors stood up to "violent racists of a generation ago."
The obvious way out of the dilemma is for folks like you to demand of Trump that he stop his bad behavior. He might listen because he doesn't want to alienate his loyal supporters.
Trump's supporters believe that criticizing Trump gives his opponents political ammunition. And staying unified behind Trump is the only way to win elections. Trump's supporters are already blaming the NeverTrump folks for Trump's current political troubles.
Trump’s America.
So, yes.  There is overlap, probably more overlap than not, but still a net affect in Trump's direction.
I think Kanye pulls more votes away from Biden than from Trump.  Black Americans are generally more conservative than the Democratic party, but they have a lot of party loyalty.  If they can't make the jump to Trump, at least they have an option for not voting Biden.

Bidebn's dementia seems to lack the depth of corruption that Trump's has. Plus Biden's explanations of his own actions don't change as wildly in short periods of time.  So, to me, Biden appears to be the "less bad" choice.
160,000+ Americans died of COVID-19 because of Trump’s incompetence and 68,000 die each year from lack of Medicare for All.
They don't realize that Trump and the American flag don't mesh.

Peaceful Transfer of Power. This means when you lose in November, you'll have to bite your tongue, put on your big boy pants, and be a man about it. I know this is asking a lot of you, Mr. Trump, and we do apologize for the inconvenience. But please hit the road gracefully.
I’m watching the full Axios HBO Trump interview and I’m legit so perplexed? When did the fascists get so fucking stupid?

You and trump are the REASON WE ARE IN THIS MESS TO BEGIN WITH!!!
I’m not sure if you’re directing that comment to me but just in case you are: Republicans &amp; Trump supporters don’t deal in facts, they deal in unproven unverified conjecture
Trump is soo desperate he has to “ Edit” photos of  to make himself look good. He’s scared.
The guy is in the middle of a scandal that makes him look misogynistic, childish and controlling! He had his campaign manager, a woman, managing his sex life with two girlfriends to keep him from melting down at her or the staff. He’s Trump in a man bun.
They attacked the Bonus Army under Hoover and Trump has his mercenaries attack folks exercising their First Amendment rights.
Kanye is there for people who despise Trump but are not Biden fans.  Just for fun they will vote for him
Trump had another First today with a 24 percent jump in virus deaths last week.  Trumps list of firsts are killing thousands.  Over 155,000
Like everywhere else in the country, in the more rural areas of the state, Trump definitely has more, but in the more urban areas, (here that would be cities like Manchester and Nashua), it’s more split, with Biden having a few more.  At least from my observations
If you aren’t a fan of someone who is a fan of you just don’t interact with them. I don’t think you have a right once you put something out to tell others they can’t enjoy it. Permission to use your content is a different story (ex: Tom petty and trump rallies) but to say (cont.)
What signs? Don’t think I’m aware of this one. Last sign related post I saw was a friend of mine complaining about Trump signs in Dracut, but that’s not really worth tweeting about.
I like your optimism about New Hampshire, but as one who lives just over the border from there, I see an awful lot of Biden signs up there. Signs are split pretty evenly between him and Trump.
Who’s fighting for the $600 a month additional UI benefits? Democrats. Who’s been in court trying to rip Pre-Existing conditions from Healthcare? Trump &amp; the Republican GOP.
Trump just wont stop turning our nation into a pile of unethical, lying dogshit! He wont stop, theres no lie noxious enough or just flat out untrue for him to regurgitate! His Republican cohorts will not step up &amp; do a thing to stop his attacks on our voting rights! #LiarInChief
Like Trump’s Pssy grabbing Tape?
Throw in this gif too to convince them we worship Trump as an immortal God-Emperor who will one day rule all mankind.
Can’t wait for Trump to get cancelled in November
In an abrupt reversal, President Donald Trump is encouraging voters in the critical swing state of Florida to vote by mail after months of criticizing the practice — and while his campaign and the GOP challenge Nevada over its new vote-by-mail law.
And this is Trump's fault. He think that if he says something enough, it magically becomes true. So if he then tells his mindless clan that Fauci is lying, they regurgitate his lunacy as well. Charles Manson, Jim Jones, they ain't got nothing on Donald Trump's shit show circus!
The move would mark an unprecedented use of public property for partisan political purposes.
After we see Trump’s tax returns
Day 90: On Jan 29th 2017, in the middle of the travel ban firestorm, Trump wagged the dog by ordering a raid in Yemen. The operation wounded five soldiers and cost the lives of a Navy SEAL and around 30 civilians - including children.  The raid yielded no actual intelligence.
That was smooth. I’ll still take him over Trump.
I’m so sorry I wasn’t sure if you seriously thought Trump was good the extension. He &amp; the GOP think the $600 is too much
#BernieGotScrewed Imagine the energy we could have had with Bernie vs Trump?
And people like you should be held accountable for the sh*t storm that is the Trump presidency. Unemployment is at the highest level ever. Wake up, honey.
Since the GOP has thrown in their lot with Trump, ethics be damned, theres no way this will pass through Congress.
If only Trump believed in helping the American People but during this Pandemic w/thousands of people dying but we get “ It is what it is”
Donald Trump has done no such thing. The only reason he has backed off on saying it's a hoax is that he is losing in the polls.
If you could advise President Trump, what would you tell him to do about the COVID-19 epidemic? Over 150,000 have already died of it (including my own dad). How would you stop it or slow it down?
When Trump yells “ Fake News” it means it’s true
On the contrary, it wouldn't surprise me if Trump's approval is a few points HIGHER. The reason is that Trump's supporters include quite a few paranoids who refuse to tell pollsters anything. The pollsters will have no way of estimating how many of those exist.
Wait, I thought he said that he has been tested regularly? Trump is the one that constantly lies?
No surprise. Trump's supporters know that public health concerns are jeopardizing Trump's re-election chances. And they have shown a willingness to do whatever is necessary to ram aside anyone who gets in Trump's way.
Perhaps the United States is better liked by the leaders that Trump likes: Orban in Hungary, Putin in Russia, and other autocrats.

If I had a dollar for every time the Hatch Act is brought up regarding the trump administration and nothing happens, I would have a lot of dollars.
Trump is trying to extort Microsoft. Real funny.
This not unimportant. However, compared to 1,000 people in our country who are dying daily from Covid-19, who cares?!  Trump must address a national strategy immediately. It's not too late.
really funny  on yahoo                 #julia-Louis-dreyfus         #trump-tubal
2 words for Previous Govs in Fla who Trump has touted as a perfect example of how a State should run an election... "HANGING CHADS"!  What a huge fubar for Fla &amp; US! So lets ignore Trumps advice &amp; go w/what we know! Mail in ballots are safe &amp; very legitimate! SMH!! #TrumpLies
trump does
The unwritten one about Trump's life that ends with him going to jail
Trump is a nasty, lying, sick individual... Says Fla is the measure of excellence? Can anyone say..."HANGING CHAD"? Trumps an evil vicious monster &amp; just rotten to the core! REPUBLICANS  MUST STEP IT UP! Seniors get their meds by mail! On top of all their regular shopping!
Didn't Bernie say similar things about Trump on the trail? Didn't he say he would back the nominee if it wasn't him? Rose Twitter doesn't get to be upset over this
is a badass interviewer. Love how calm she remains while calling out the crap that Trump's Desciple was spewing.
So the question was answered. Donald Trump didn't go to John Lewis' funeral because, according to fuckface Trump, John Lewis didn't go to Trump's inauguration. What a shitty fucking human!!!  Obama, Clinton, even George W. Bush was there, but not that bitch of a President, Trump.
Trump has more sympathy for Epstein’s Indicted Sex Trafficing girlfriend than he does for the Families &amp; Friends of the over 155,000 people who’ve died from Covid. How Fking sad is that?
Was it a mail-in or an absentee ballot? Trump and his Disciples believe there's a difference.
yeah, as someone not intimately involved with Green Party internal politics, I don't quite grasp what was not kosher about Howie's actions. If we had any other viable left option I'd worry more about it, but Biden and Trump are straight out, and Jo Jorgenson is def a R Lib.
Also the headline is like “Trumpism after Trump” so even it doesnt think he can last much longer
Trump 2020.  #DrainTheSwamp #KeepAmericaNormalAgain
Everyone should vote for Trump, actually
Trump once said that he “knows more than the generals.”
I voted for Stein last time never dreaming that we were dumb enough to elect Trump. I want Trump out and the best option is Biden no matter how unpalatable.#BernieShouldaWon
All deals will have to be consummated at a Trump-branded property.
I pray everyday Trump gets a wicked case of the Trump Virus... Would bring great happiness to all of us! Hes a slimebag!
Reporters who's questioning any other politician they go in for the kill... they ask the tough questions but they never do it to Trump! The reporters are afraid of trump &amp; we need them to go after him back him into a corner get the truth out of him!
Trump's Executive Order "Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty" allows Churches to express, which strongly encourages the church goers to agree, their opinion related to what certain political parties they agree with and to even encourage supporting a specific politician
I'm just going to say it, the reporters that sit in these stupid news briefing by Trump are pathetic! They don't ask him any tough questions they don't challenge him on anything he says they let him get away with bloody murder on TV! It makes me sick
Biden hasn't even campaigned and he's crucifying Trump.  I think we could've put a monkey against Trump and it would've won.
If literally ANYONE else was in charge of the response, the dead would have numbered in the thousands. Only Trump could manage to kill over a hundred fifty thousand people. No one is asking if Trump thinks more people dying is good, or bad? He might define success differently.
my dad hung a trump flag in the front bedroom windows i give anyone permission to smash them JUST NOT MY BEDROOM WINDOW PLEASE
Trump and his son in-law Kushner should be jailed for murder.  Their incompetence has been criminal with 155,000 deaths so far.   Dr Fauci was right.  Trump and his supporters in Congress have to go.
Really Kayleigh? It’s the Trump Administration that’s in court trying to get Pre-Existing Conditions coverage out of Healthcare. NOT THE DEMOCRATS!
Hey Kimber, Democrats care if children, teachers, school staff &amp; families don’t die from Covid. If only Trump &amp; Republicans have a damn.

The real reason that Trump is in trouble is that his bag of tricks doesn't work on the coronavirus. If it hadn't been for the coronavirus, the economy might still be in decent shape and Trump would still have a decent shot at re-election.
Smart, Young, Understanding, Technologically literate, Caring, New Ideas, and Asian American. Hes a true leader and hes fed up with the governments bullshit. Yang can pull 20-30 percent of Trump voters with all democratic voters along side. Every political party loves Yang
People are individuals. Many good people love guns and small government or just tolerate Trump because they don’t like Dems.   Many Dems who support woke candidates with policies that empower the poor, are still hateful, greedy, self-centered people who mostly just want accolades
One of my aunts loves Trump too. With her you might be right. She’s always been kinda mean and hateful even though she loves me.  I know some real jerks who are liberal too. Egotistical, morally self-righteous. Some value ambition and attention over charity and understanding.
My neighbor loves Trump. He also loves his kid and helping me out, whether it’s helping push my wife’s car outta the snow or texting me when I leave the garage door open.   No one was more welcoming when my Puerto Rican family moved into our very white neighborhood.
I’m sick and tired of this idea that we have to pick a side. My sister likes Trump and her AR-15. She’s gonna teach my daughter to shoot it.  Nothing you or the internet or Trump or Biden ever tells me will overcome my 42 years of living and seeing how good and kind she is.
If you say police are bad, how are you at all different than Trump when he calls journalists and his critics ‘enemies of the people?’  If all Trump supporters lack character and patriotism, how are you different than Trump when he says liberals want to destroy America?
If you stereotype and lump all Trump supporters together, how are you better than Trump?  How do you plan to reach them and change their minds with group hate and dismissal?  How are you better than those who rant about all “the libs” or claim all progressives are socialists?
I have to ask what cut of the 35million is going to Trump/Kushner family

Where is the reconciliation part? How are you going to reconcile the 30-35% of Americans who will still have voting for Trump?
President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed into law legislation that will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands.
Day 91: On Jan 27th, 2017 Trump signed the wildly racist "travel ban", barring people from 7 Muslim countries &amp; suspending the US's refugee program nearly nine months "to prevent terrorism".  The ban met fierce opposition socially and legally, being blocked almost immediately.
I may be wrong but I do kinda think that those women who stand for Trump come from households where there are oppressive male figures. Emotional abuse where they are just used to it. I know...its a stretch. Could be just indoctrination of a political party!🤔
It only makes sense that Barack Obama is a Leo and Donald Trump is a Gemini
For the umpteenth time: Folks like you who keep denouncing Trump for having no plan, wouldn't like any plan that Trump would come up with. It would be very heavy on "Open everything" Social Darwinism and very light on public health concerns.
Trump the murderer
It's not for the economy. It's to create a facade of "return to normalcy" to boost Trump's reelection chances. I have yet to meet ANY "Open everything up!" proponent who is NOT a Trump supporter.
She is a child sex trafficker , Trump says “big deal” 🤦‍♂️

Trump’s America
I share the concerns of Trump and others on mass, never-before-tried-on-this-scale #MailInVoting.  But it will likely be a reality.  The #GOP should have some people fighting against it in court, where and when they can, but they should have many many more others
Trump needs to continue to show that leadership on the virus through November in order to win re-election, no matter how well the economy improves, or how much the civil unrest/ violence subsides, if it does.
I give credit to Trump and the campaign for finally accepting that the #Corinavirus is the main issue today , whether they like it or not, and dealing with it appropriately.  I share their frustration that other things such as the economy and security aren’t number one, and I...
I still have to give the edge to Biden in the #PresidentialElection,  but Trump has certainly narrowed the gap.  Battleground state polls are tightening.  The change in leadership at the top of the campaign has seemed to help; more serious, focused relevant messaging
Benedict Arnold is still remembered. Trump deserves the same notoriety.
Give me 30 minutes of Trump with  in the first ever First Blood Hell In A Cell match! #WWERaw
#WomenAgainstTrump It blows my mind that any woman would support Trump. My mother is in the Trump cult and she can't explain to me what she thinks he's done for women, other than degrading them and treating them like they are a lesser being.
I suspect Trump carries the water for Miller.
The anti-mask protesters aren't protesting out of ignorance. They have an agenda: Make America look as normal as possible (no masks, opened economy, opened schools) to help re-elect Trump.
Trump doesn’t give a mother fuck about women or #WomensRights #ResisterSisters #womenagainsttrump
Joe Biden takes this Pandemic seriously unlike Trump &amp; complies with the CDC Guidelines. That makes him a LEADER!
The center has no viable options other than to deal a crippling blow to Trumpism. What would you suggest? Allowing Lindsey Graham to get away with being a protégé of Trump?
Many of Trump's supporters really do consider those numbers fake.
A number of Trump's supporters have insisted publicly that the hospitals are deliberately and falsely inflating the death totals as a ploy to get more money. The conservative website  just featured a diary saying that the death total is "vastly exaggerated"
Perhaps you've forgotten that National Review devoted an entire issue to "Against Trump," and guys like Bill Kristol tried desperately to find some other Republican who would fight Trump all the way to the GOP convention if need be.

Sadly too, as I'm sure you heard in the story, this has been going on for decades, and although Trump has ratcheted up the cruelty to a whole new evil level, our immigration policies are hideous.

I just finished watching Immigration Nation on Netflix and it just crushed me. The cruelty and the ease with which it's inflicted is just mind-boggling. I hate Trump even more than I did before.

Doesn't change the fact that he's above the law. There need to be hard and fast rules put into place, and it's pathetic that there aren't already. And it's not just Trump that has broken the standards, it's the entire Republican party.
This to PELOSI HOW MANY TIME HAVE YOU Degrade the OFFICE OF the PRESIDENT!
Instead of appealing and trying to get more black votes the Trump administration thinks black people are dumb enough to vote for a black rapper they know has no chance of winning. Sounds about right
Because through Trump, they can fulfill their wishlist because he's so easy to manipulate. He's a means to an end. Hopefully, it will be an end...THEIR end.

And this is a SURPRISE?? And why is she defending Trump?? She deserves whatever she gets. She lost credibility long ago.
If these anecdotes are true (And I believe they are), there's no possible way that people around him not named Trump aren't aware of this. It just seems like it would have leaked out from someone in the White House at some point over the last 4 years.
Part of me always wonders about this. There are so many things they could bring to light, but Trump has been great for corporate mainstream media's bottom line. I think they want to help keep him where he is for that purpose. They don't want to kill the golden goose.

That would leave Pence (who worries me greatly). I'd really like to see trump humiliated and emasculated with a resounding Biden victory. We will pay a very heavy price daily with trump in office....sigh.
LOVE OUR PRESIDENT!! HE WILL PROTECT OUR COUNTRY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.  4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
This is how I want to feel...but not gonna happen with Trump in office.
Oh, goodie, another criminal in the trump mafia family.
And y'all still wanna come for Trump lol. Good job Biden. #BidenIsARacist
Tic-tac according to Trump
Never mind these same morons paved the way for the Trump takeover by years of racist dog-whistling, war mongering, xenophobia &amp; class warfare in the past 15 years. The gall of them to bitch about Trump now.
We PRAY for OUR  PRESIDENT TRUMP EVERY  DAY!! BEST PRESIDENT EVER
ROLL RED!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
CONGRATS OUR FELLOW AMERICAN. IT A PLEASURE TO STAND WITH YOU 🇺🇸  4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP!! YOU ARE THE ONLY PRESIDENT THAT CAN SAVE OUR COUNTRY!!🇺🇸
Oh, I like this idea.   Better have Trump put $300,000 in escrow or no one will ever see it.
Beware these Never Trumpers. Just want our help to get rid of Trump for them, but the second Biden’s in office they’ll be attacking him with garbage. Goal is 22 midterms. Don’t trust them for a second, they created the environment for Trump to swoop in.
BEST PRESIDENT EVER!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
And none of what he says even makes a bit of sense. “Hurt the Bible” is nonsensical. If anyone did something close to that it was Trump himself when he posed in front of the church clutching it like a copy of Mein Kampf.
These Never Trumper ghouls just want the D’s to get rid of Trump for them, &amp; the second Biden’s in office they go back on the attack full throttle to take back the House &amp; Senate in 22. It’s so disingenuous.
Is that why the Trump Tax Scam gave $18 billion to J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley instead of struggling small businesses or American families?

What makes you think she's not qualified to be VP...misogyny at its best.... Rice is good but would depress the vote in key places. This is a political office, you want someone with political chops... Rice also has trump supporters in her fam...

CONGRATS TO OUR FELLOW AMERICAN!! ITS A PLEASURE TO STAND WITH YOU!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP 🇺🇸
Seriously.  This is some Junk from   It makes no difference who the VP is.  Which woman he picks will only affect our comfort level going forward, and wont have any impact on whom we vote for.  I’m sick of Trump enablers.  Get over yourselves.  You have already lost.

That ... and does he still support Trump?
The south shore is decidedly Trump country, also Billerica &amp; some other 128 burbs.
The talking point should be Trump’s state of mind, the man with access to Nukes and a finger hovering over the button. What the he’ll is wrong with you!
Thank you to all the Trump haters for making my day. I needed to see a good dose idiocracy. Bye now.
I still haven’t heard a cogent argument as to why you got it ‘right’ in 2000 with Gore, and you argue popular vote, but you guessed Trump in 2016, so Hillary should have been your argument for consistencies’ sake. Can you explain?
Wow. Really touched a nerve of the those who hate Trump, who will never admit the truth. Commandment #9. Read just one story on #WalkAway .
So a Trump Biden debate would be unintelligible.

So today we confirmed once again The FBI under Obama did not “spy” on Trump They were investigating Russia for election interference and saw Trump campaign officials interacting with the Russians   Yet the calling it the “Russian collusion hoax” is Trump’s only defense lol
So, Allan, I’ve been waiting on your projection for a long time, but I have a question!? So you say you were correct in 2000 with Gore, but then in 2016 you predicted Donald Trump would win, but Hillary won the popular vote by 3 million votes. Can you have it both ways?

If Trump can't tell the difference between an elephant and a lion 🤣 Sleepy Joe  can't tell the difference between his wife and his sister
I would like to ask Democrats a question. Beyond defeating Trump, what are your expectations of Joe Biden? How do you expect the country to change?
She had my sympathy up until the point she blamed it on Trump. Next to Hillary, I’ve never seen a more bitter person with a constant chip on her shoulder, in spite of everything that’s been handed to her.

immigration nation is really an eye opener. crazy to see these officers making jokes while families are being separated. kids are taken from their parents. truly disgusting.. and with that being said FUCK TRUMP N ICE
Did you know that Trump reads… a lot? They like to say he doesn’t read, but he reads. A lot.

If Trump lost the election but refused to leave the office on the claims that some of the ballots cast were fraudulent, could that lead to a declaration of war?  #DefundThePolice  #NoComradesUnder1k
Watching the secondary outdoor overflow stage being disassembled that night was the greatest self-own to Trump since his inauguration.
Must be it. Hard to separate your greatest hits. Must be killing Trump he can’t throw these cult-fests with his dumb followers fawning upon him. He tried one which was an embarrassment &amp; got his buddy killed.
White supremist Trump lover? Curious....
Oh, Trump would just LOVE to spend a lot of time with Elmer &amp; listen to his concerns! (Reality - he wishes Elmer died already after he voted for him)
Per Trump: “I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
Clinton going to the island is irrelevant. Where are the specific allegations from the girls as long as we’re playing the proximity game with Trump?
Please refer me to the specific accusations from girls at the islands the Clinton raped them - as long as you’re buffering Trump.
How bout at Mar a dumpo? Epstein was a long time member there. But we know those rich losers protect each other. Back to my original point- I don’t care if Clinton was involved, but Trump was involved too.
LOVE OUR PROUD FELLOW AMERICANS!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
Cmon there are thousands of pics with Epstein &amp; Trump hanging out. Best buds!!!
Holy crap all u Never Trumpers are going to vote for him anyway. I don’t trust u for a second. If Biden gets to office u will be in attack mode instantly. Get rid of Trump yourself.
Why do you deflect with Clinton instead of addressing Trump’s involvement?  Btw I’m a D &amp; if Clinton was screwing girls - F him. So back to the original assertion to the link with Trump.
... I wear a Trump bracelet. I showed it to two PAs at Doc ofc. They would not even make eye contact w/me. I wore Trump mask to groc store. A young (kid) grocery bagger snickered at me &amp; would not look at or talk 2me. The amount of hate in America is absolutely frightening.
One family member laced in to me because I support Trump. He did not like what I wrote on FB. One lifelong girlfriend has gone off left deep end. We cannot talk politics. I find i do not want to associate much w/her any more. She disagrees with absolutely every idea i present.
Truly, nobody cares what you have to say, sir. You had your time, you failed, it’s over for you. That you still support Trump is telling.
Trump bump!
Because they are F***ING MISERABLE and Want the Rest of US that way. BUT NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!! 4 MORE YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP
Isn't that cute... A trump supporter trying to discuss an assault on intelligence.... Priceless.
#ItIsWhatItIs Only class Trump must have been really good at was 'double speak' and 'adjectives for dummies'
Not being Trump is pretty compelling though. Lol. I agree, we need a debate. Some are concerned it will be an entire debate fact checking Trump. Point out his lie and move on. A moderator needs to not allow endless Trump interruptions while he pulls out his preK graphs.
Has there ever been a world leader who is equally mendacious, incompetent, ignorant, cruel, lazy, and racist as Trump?

Biden has a way of smiling/laughing at the foolishness of other candidates during debates. I have a feeling this will get under Trump’s skin. Biden won’t take his bait, and will hammer that SOB into the ground with stats and figures. Plus, insults won’t work well with Covid 💀

Actually they are more offended by Trump pretending to be religious. I'm not saying good or bad I'm just telling you what I know.
I can see why you only have a high school diploma. You have vacillated over all the talking points from Trump. Schools should open because EU has, the US has controlled Covid19, tested more, China is to blame, but no facts ever. When faced with facts deny and deflect. Enough, bye
He isn’t Trump
You may have a hard time. Although the Amish are religiously conservative they put a LOT of stock on morality. I know a few Amish and they see Trump as "fake religious" which is an afront to them. They lean towards conservative ideals but Trump turns a lot of them off.

Hydroxycloroquine does not treat COVID-19. In fact, zinc is more helpful than hydroxycloroquine. The reason why you people repeat this is because you are thin-skinned enough to die on the hill for anything Trump says
I honestly don't agree with you. The cult is so far gone that they will bring civil unrest when Trump loses, no matter how wide the margin. The best it can be done is to televise the court proceedings so that hopefully they themselves will finally understand their own stupidity
Disgusting...
I got into a convo recent with a few #BernieOrBust types recently and they flat out said they were willing to give Trump 8yrs to burn the country down if it meant waking people up to the broken system. Not sure they care about the lives lost in that scenario...
Yes, I remember your similar statement when a white supremacist Trump supporter gunned down 23 in an El Paso Walmart.
Where is Barr on this. Oh yes, f*$ing around protecting Trump cronies like Stone, Flynn, Manafort, Maxwell and not protecting the American people.

Idiot, you asked America before you were elected “what do we have to lose “ apparently a TON, and now that you tanked the economy which was the only thing you thought you were good on, now we really don’t have anything to lose by going with Biden, we only lose the loser. Trump

Personally, I don't think Biden should debate trump until he releases his taxes.
Please. Hundreds of guys in the union support trump right now. Knock that shit off.
If it's really a national security risk, it would be treated like Grindr and forced to be sold to a US company or spin off into separate, US-based company, but Trump is even against that...
It doesn't bother me that hes not a union supporter. I'm a union guy and I still vote trump. Its funny how we were all told we should embrace Obama care and about a year after, our union president said it was a mistake.
I agree with that, but Trump said he doesn't want tik Tok to be sold to an American company. This is turning into a personal political issue with cyber security as the side.
I you HATE trump .. you are A OKAY my book
No it wasn't. The end of that administration was on an extremely slow incline. Trump gave it a major jump start by eliminating regulations and bringing jobs back to America.

And yet there are still a handful of supporters who think Trump is playing with a full deck.
Memories don't attach in Trump's hippocampus anymore, so he still thinks it's an abnormally warm January.
Nope, actually quotes.  Would you like me to fill a page with videos from Trump?  Hell, you'd be busy for the entire weekend just watching them.   I think there are probably more black rhinos left on the planet than those who think Trump is playing with a full deck.
Trump is what you see when you've imbibed far too many cosmopolitans on the nights when the full moon is too close.
True.  I have a few hundred Trump quotes right at my fingertips that denigrated blacks, Hispanics, and women and several Trump quotes wishing child sex traffickers well.

Trump needs a safe haven right after he gets the boot and right before Letitia James hauls him into court.  Putin is readying his dacha on the Black Sea.
A woman voting for Trump is like an endangered black rhino voting for the poacher.
Why would a Republican governor lie about testing positive?  Doesn’t that run counter to Trump’s arguments?
He’s playing dumb because that is the path of least resistance for him.  The post Trump presidency job offer he was promised at Trump Inc. looks increasingly in jeopardy once Vance finishes his investigation.
Actually, you haven’t been paying attention.  It was Trump who was babbling about God yesterday.  You seem to have trouble focusing. Have you seen a neurologist and been checked for neurofibrillary tangles?  I hope you’re covered under the ACA if your doctor refers you.
Trump is a devout apostate.  One of the most important tenets of western religions is confessing your sins and asking for God’s forgiveness.  Trump admitted that he’s never done that.  Even after sleeping with a porn star while his wife was nursing a newborn.
Jesus, Trump is sweating worse than Vegas Elvis.
I wish I was as flexible as these Trump supporters. I’m too stiff, and old, and could never contort and twist myself in the way they do trying to make his idiotic statements and mistakes make any semblance of sense.

Correct, here is Trump using other pronunciations from the subcontinent.
“Why I read about the tests in my new issue of Highlights,” said Trump.
Forget about Trump’s lack of religion for a second and focus on the absurdity of his argument.  For his supporters to agree with him, they have to admit that Joe Biden is more powerful than God in order to be able to hurt God.  To do so is to admit God isn’t omnipotent.  Apostasy

If that's a reason for banning something, we can start with Trump and Pompeo
"Trump Lawyer Rudy Giuliani Says Black Lives Matter (#BLM) Led by 'Killers' Who 'Hate White People' "
Obviously Trump thinks differently than you do.  He actually thinks Biden possesses the cognitive ability to hurt  God.  Given that God is omnipotent, Biden must possess incredible acumen in order to devise a plan to hurt God and to hurt the Bible.  Ergo, I’ve gotta vote for him.
smile about work. that America has been about the worker, says Trump, all jobs have not been repected. the mark of a successful society a philosopher once said, is that work is respected. 2
Everything Hillary warned us about Trump has come true, but even she underestimated the number of GOP invertebrates in Congress who feared his shadow.
Enumerating Trump's lies would take days, so let me ask you a simple question. Today Trump said that Biden will hurt the Bible and will hurt God if elected.  If Biden is in mental decline, how can he hurt the Bible (?), and how can he hurt God?  Is God that weak or that gullible?
Trump's position has stabilized, his brain on the other hand...
Bear in mind that 78% of Trump supporters think that Jonah spent 3 days inside the belly of a big fish.
Trump’s not a symptom, he’s patient zero.
Schlapp won’t because she’s an asshole and the Trump campaign won’t because those who have served and are now serving in the military are a constant reminder of Trump’s five deferments due to a bruised Fallopian tube.
Trump has set a record among presidents for breaking every one of the 10 Commandments.

How can you equivocate on the choice? I am a lapsed Conservative Republican who is now an Independent voter. How could you even contemplate voting for Trump? He ignores States Rights
This is a good thing, Rosie, why diminish it? Letitia will send Trump to Rikers by Feb. of 2021.
...because these people are not smart. Most people can see right from wrong, and truth from lies. Trump supporters are generally not well educated, and usually the ones who are educated, stick with Trump, because their racist bigoted ways are so strong, they justify their stance.
Everyone in the Trump administration is temporally challenged.  Remember, these are the same folks who blamed President Obama for not developing a test for a virus that didn't arrive in the country until 3 years after he left the presidency.
It's a plot to give airtime to those who propagate the narrative that people in the Trump administration are extraordinarily undereducated.
Reread my post s l o w l y. You don't have to be around kids to be indifferent to their health and healthcare.   Come on, Eric, why keep posting nonsense that propagates the narrative that Trump supporters are undereducated.
No doubt.  Wonder what his moniker for Letitia James will be?  No one infuriates Trump quite like an intelligent black woman.
I feel like the Feds are showing restraint because it could hurt the Republicans in November. But if Trump wins and this nonsense escalates there is going to be a come-to-Jesus real quick for these “peaceful protestors”
He didn’t say that. From your beloved Snopes:
That won't stop Trump.
After that Axios interview disaster, the injecting disinfectants while cramming a light up your rear, and other gems that come out of Trump when he meanders, or is pushed off written script, you'd think his campaign would want to keep him the hell away from open dialogue events.
It’s refreshing to see people other than hydroxychloroquine mfgs. making money off of Trump’s stupidity.
Swan works for Axios which is headquartered in Arlington, Va.  Did you think that Trump flew to Canberra to do the interview?
I wrote something similar. The number of vets, retired people, elderly, etc., that rely on the USPS to receive meds, checks, etc., is significant. Trump doesn't give a sh*t about hurting any of these people, many who gave their all for the USA, so long as slowing mail helps him.
Well, I’m guessing you’re a Trump supporter, so I tried to find the simplest explanation for you:
How are Americans gonna get their stimulus checks if Trump doesn’t trust the competence of the post office?
If only Lindsey understood that it’s 2020 and nobody cares that he plays for the other team.  He could come out of the Mar-a-Lago closet and Trump couldn’t blackmail him anymore.
Trump’s brain is filled with neurofibrillary tangles and he is incapable of absorbing information and storing it or concentrating on anything for more than a minute or two.  You could ask him how many eggs are in a dozen and it would befuddled him.
The one thing that the Trump administration has been transparent about is its mendacity.
The one thing that the Trump campaign and administration have been transparent about is their corruption.  They know the invertebrates in Congress will let them get away with it.
Nothing like exploiting a mental disease for political gain.  Lots of practice exploiting Trump’s in order to bring the country back to the Bronze Age.
Oh sweetie, “Manhattan socialite”, really?? You are giving Ivanka too much credit. She is just as corrupt, complicit, inept, and disgusting as every single other person that is connected to Donald Trump. Lest we forget how so, here’s a photo of her illegally hawking Goya.
At least I live in a State with a governor who is smart, and despite being a Republican, doesn’t drink their KoolAid drivel. He is willing to stand up to Trump, and do what is right for his citizens! Thank you ⁦
Wonder how Trump will react when he loses Florida?   Hope the charts he's looking at re: Nevada aren't the same ones he looked at for COVID-19 deaths per population.
TRump is an extremely little man.  He proves it over and over again.
I hope he doesn’t think tRump is a moderate.  He is heavily involved in influencing as many outcomes of elections as is humanly possible.  This is just more republican hypocritical crap.
&gt;implying donald trump is going to harvest our organs to stay alive that long
Harbinger of things to come.  After praising Florida just now, what happens when Trump loses the state in Nov.?
I view tRump as an extreme idiot.
Whatever contagion Trump carries infects the prefrontal cortices of those who come into close contact with him and cause them to sound and act like half-wits.
Definitely a 5.  I’ll never get used to the extraordinary lack of knowledge Trump exhibits daily.
Blame the Democrats cuz Trump’s brain is clogged with amyloid plaques?  Ridiculous!  The Senate would have never voted to convict.   If you’re gonna blame anyone, blame the WH physician for lying about Trump’s physical and mental health.
Trump would benefit cuz it would draw attention away from his buffoonish interview with Jonathan Swan from Axios.
Fauci owns half the patent on a vaccine..he was also part of a group to splice up the virus to act in a certain way so that a vaccine would be needed and also shutdown the economy in hopes to get Trump out of office..wake up ppl..no way I’m taking a vaccine of any kind
He is a tRump goon, what do you expect?
Have you taken a moment to check inventory on who you are calling racist..it has been made clear they have made stuff up about Trump when, in fact, he loves helping all Americans..the same treatment for everyone..he’s helping you out as you bash him..think about that!
All you athletes out there that lean left and hate trump..are you for pedophilia, racism, corruption and child and human trafficking..just askin? The DNC and progressives have been duping you for years..do you align w/ Satan? These are good questions for you
When tRump became President
Trump’s greeting to his Jewish donor.
Who is surprised that the CEO got a boatload of shares just before they surged?  The one thing the Trump  administration has been transparent about is their corruption.
Ted are you still afraid of Trump’s shadow.  Is he still allowed to attack your wife’s looks and accuse your father of plotting to assassinate a president?  Does Trump still call you “Lyin’ Ted?” Didn’t mommy tell you to hide under the covers so the Trump monster can’t get you?
I have said the exact same thing. It is taking nothing out on the kid. It is pointing out that there should be NO double standards. Either Trump forces open his kid’s private school for in-person education or he backs the eff off making public schools do it!
Donald Trump is a fvcking moron pass it on
I see Trump hanging over the bow of the Titanic screaming " We're lower than the world!"
Does anyone except Trump and Hannity take anything Hannity says seriously?  Sadly, most of the folks watching him are wondering who that person staring back at them in the mirror is.
He did.  He thinks Lewis was simply some guy about whom Trump knew very little except the unpardonable offense of not going to his inaugural. Tiny-brained, thin-skinned, and digitally challenged is no way to go through life, Donnie.
Yea that’s what we are worried about, black water.  This is a hypocrite and fraud.  No genuine follower of Christ would ever promote the tRump administration.
Either a: Mets fan or Phillies  b:Just watched a Trump interview c:can’t believe that 40% of the country believes Trump d: all of the above
He is the moth piece of the Republican Party.  tRump will parrot everything he says about them.
The virus is spreading, Trump's memory of it is receding.
So when can the important ppl we trust in the #Trump admin start calling out Fauci/Birx/Gates/CDC/WHO - because they ruining the lives of ppl around the world for greed to fundamentally change our country (and eventually the world) forever..The American ppl see through it
Trump probably forgot to tell you that he secretly sold the mineral rights to Putin.
This from a guy who allowed a bully to attack his wife's looks and accuse his father of plotting to assassinate a president. Cruz is still afraid of Trump's shadow.
A woman voting for Trump is like an endangered white rhino voting for the poacher.
Russia is the world's largest money laundering operation for which Trump Inc. is the U.S. branch office.
Such a double standard considering Melania being hired to be tRump's wife!
Does that mean Trump can’t vote?  He went 10 years that we know of without contributing anything and faked a bruised Fallopian tube so he wouldn’t have to serve his country.
Only bucket is the one drenching Trump out of office in November.. You look a bit wicked witch .. perhaps you should stay clear of buckets of water yourself..
Banning Apps in the Time of Cholera by Donald Trump
Have ya seen a Trump rally?  Those folks use the flag as Depends.
Here’s the thing.  Memories don’t attach anymore for Trump, so he’s completely unaware that 155,000 people have died from the Trumpvirus in the US alone.  He still thinks it’s January.
Trump ‘Doesn’t Plan To Have Fair And Unfettered Election … Plans To Install Himself In Some Emergency Way,’ Says Rep. Clyburn - The Daily Caller - these Democratic clowns know it’s a landslide coming
The loons are Trump, Gohmert, Nunes, Gaetz and Gym Jordan.. A bunch of angry, impotent white men.. Perhaps you fall into that group perfectly..
What do you want to bet that trump will side with Russia again, instead of our allies. SMH.
“Trump golfed” Shortest verse in the WH Bible.
I think what Trump meant to say was that 96 Republicans support him.
The primary prerequisite for serving in the Trump administration is the ability to lie with ease
Dan's position is that the US suffering more damage, by far, from coronavirus  than any other country was the Trump Administration's plan all along.  Umm, welcome to the #Resistance?
Love  - #Patriots stand with you and the #Trump admin for school choice 🇺🇸
I say it again, until the time Trump's kid, Barron's school reopens for in-person educational teaching, all schools in the country do as his does, and to remote learning only. No questions asked.
Do #Tumpwits count as right wing or are they just Ill informed dupes who have no governing philosophy other than Trump
Well to be fair , I would think most GOPers know in their minds Trump is a dumpster fire and his loss is his own fault
He needs Trump's hairstylist!
Trump does.... can we finally use the phrase “basket of deplorables” now for him, his cronies, and his supporters, and have it truly mean something?
Are you kidding with that tweet.. He’s being thoughtful with his selection.... Watch Trump freak out and Dump Pence for Nikki Haley...
Dr. Fauci is brilliant, tRump is a intellectually challenged.  The choice is very simple.
Now you’re just proving you never read either.  Why post and propagate the narrative that Trump supporters are cognitively challenged?
40 Million Unemployed! 153k dead Americans, Lowest GDP drop in history! Trump is a failure and must be removed!
Says the former campaign manager of the most corrupt president in 🇺🇸 history..Barry Otero..Barry knows that Trump knows all..clocks ticking  #TickTock
It’s all I can to stop laughing...if Trump saw these he might drop out. These are the women that find him attractive!
To be fair, Graham's contrast is off because his retinas are damaged from having his head up Trump's ass for so long.
She is such a genius she showed a check with all of tRump information, routing, acct number anything you’d like.

Having Pelosi as president would be the ultimate kick in Trump’s Fallopian tubes. Yeeeouch!
How incurious do Trump and Miller have to be that 3 3/4 years into a presidency they still have no idea what’s in the Constitution and are clueless about even the basics of government?
Unless the invertebrates making up the GOP in Congress actually choose the future of their party over a lunatic, it doesn't matter.  The silence from most of them when asked about Trump's threat to fuck with the election tells you all you need to know.
He didn’t do it to those people, fucking China did !!!   Blame China not trump
Think about that.  Trump and Kush let military vets in nursing facilities die and front line workers die because those two thought it would be a good political strategy.   How black does your heart have to be to have that kind of sociopathic disregard for life?
Deborah, given the fact that I never mentioned Trump's name or even used his initials when I responded to DinaNYC, what made you assume I was referring to something Trump said.?  What was there about the reference to Clorox that brought Trump immediately to your mind?
Nikki the fact that the color of the sky in your world is Trump Orange means you will never be President.
Pop-up Trump stand sparks political friction in North Falmouth:  #capecod
And I am here because I don’t like Trump, he’s a turgid piece of excrement. I also have a right to voice my opinion about who the VP pick is. I don’t like Harris, but it doesn’t mean I won’t vote agent orange out of the White House.
Trump was a witness for the prosecution.
Saw that.  That's a ol' big matzo ball hanging out there against Trump.
Good to see Trump's new major response to COVID-19 is to quote Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range lyrics.
After listening to 3 former Presidents in eulogy to John Lewis. Trump is just a friggin idiot.......
Not nice to speak about the dead, but he was not a nice guy, like trump and because he died does not make him a good guy.
You left with no hope.. You and Trump, hopeless ..
Another thing that separates you from Trump.
You didn’t get a check?  Had you applied for a DACA application and Trump rejected it or are you here illegally and working at one of Trump’s golf courses?
The Animal Cruelty and Torture Act was a Ted Deutch revision and had nothing to do with Trump. The  Future Act was a bipartisan congressional bill guaranteeing STEM funds, also not proposed by Trump.  You’re listing other’s ideas and crediting them as positives re:Trump?
And Trump isn’t... Your point?
Trump’s been president for 3 3/4 years yet the Covfefe Cult still absolves him from any blame. Government assistance to farmers under Trump is socialism.  Surprised you’re bringing it up. I thought Trumers hated socialism.  Did you send back your stimulus check?
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic there were twice as many farm bankruptcies under Trump than under President Obama.
So Trump will force the USPS to fail, just to get his own way.
Glad to hear you weren’t hoodwinked, bamboozled, and misled by Trump
Just chaff from the WH to try to interfere with people’s ability to focus on the 150,000 deaths and astonishing collapse in the economy due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.
Disregarding people like me, independent voters, is a great way to lose this election. I hate Trump, just look at my tweets, but I dislike K. Harris about as much. I do love Kiesha Lance Bottoms, however. I can have an opinion and not be a bot.
Another turd floating in the Trump Bowl.  Just chaff to try to interfere with people’s ability to focus on the 150,000 deaths and a record setting drop in the economy due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.
Herman Cain was a covid denier.  He went to the Oklahoma rally without a mask. He was a tRump supporter to the end.  If he had used the smarts God gave him he would not be dead.
We should simply ignore all this chaff and focus on health, the economic collapse, and the things we’ve lost due to Trump’s astonishing incompetence.
Kids are smart as hell - my 10 year old neighbor just asked if we think trump is tweeting about delaying an election b/c of the really really really bad numbers that came out today on the economy.
Trump killed  next on the list for the #trumpVirus is you  &amp; you won’t be missed.
Think Trump will go to the funeral if it’s held in the suburbs?
Hey  - just checking but are you going to be writing a follow-up piece on the one attacking Biden for saying Trump might try to delay the election? I'm really looking forward to it
Trump floats election ‘delay’ amid claims of voting fraud:  #capecod
I have a feeling trump will not be holding a press conference to brag about these numbers.
DV Trump - deep trouble dollar, (not likely to surrender). Trump - America has been about the worker. Worker rights.  Oh yes, reward for work good way to do business.
Trump is running on a platform of: Indecency Kleptocracy Alien DNA injections
The reason he pardoned Stone was so that Stone could come up with those nifty three word slogans that Trump can usually remember. Drain the swamp Build the wall Lock her up Whiten the suburbs
Donald Trump's knowledge of the world would earn him an F in a 6th grade civics class.
Pop-up Trump stand sparks political friction in North Falmouth:  #capecodThis had been #Trump's plan even before mail-in voting became an issue. Plan was to appoint #DeJoy to drive #USPS into the ground and then split everything up between their rich friends. The P.O. has the largest fleet in the world plus owns a ton of property.
Given the fact that we now have incontrovertible proof that mask mandates dramatically lower infection rates compared to neighboring counties with no mask mandates, the time has come for Trump to saddle up and issue a national mask mandate.  Should have been done months ago.
Pretty sure he has. Trump dosnt own alot of those properties he leases out his name. I think he only owns NY and FL. If he’s breaking the law though I’m sure the left will bring it up. But the fact that they haven’t leads me to believe he’s not. I don’t know Trumps finances.
Haters are all ways gonna hate, cause than can. President Trump is a winner &amp; haters hate winners.
I think this is your best one yet. Mostly the pic w/ President Trump going against the globe ( world ) in a chess match.
They wanted Trump to declare martial law to use against him. I’m glad he didn’t fall for their trap. Just like democrats created draft because they where against war not because they thought it was right thing for the country. The left will watch America burn if it means they win
You’re the reason Trump is in office 🤣
Why not try the british way and just ignore these trump TV show events.
But I’ll take higher debt and keep my guns and religion and not murder babies so Biden who claims to be catholic (a religion that notorious for pedaphiles and gangsters) and  is pro choice so yah I can see where Trump might make that assumption
When was any politician against debt. Regan rebuilt military after Vietnam Bush fought 2 wars and Trump has to rebuild military after 8 years of neglect and now covid. When would you like to cut spending? I’m all for it.
After 3 1/2 years of this shit show, you would consider not voting for Biden.   Then you are giving Trump your vote.  Grow up.
I WONDER HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR SOMEONE TO TELL   AND HIS FOLLOWERS THAT THAT  Executive order exist already under Obamacare 😳😳 TRUMP  FOLLOWERS  SWEAR  THEY  SMART  AND  INVENTED  THE  WHEEL  🙃🙃
I made a huge mistake voting for Trump in 2016. I have apologized over and over and I hope that helps a little bit I know it doesn't change anything. I support Joe Biden for 2020. Again, I am so so sorry!
I defend Trump because what you are saying is untrue. If you made a legit point I would agree. the swamp wants business as usual politicians get rich while in office and keep sheep’s at bay while protecting pediphiles in high places. Trump goes against that so they hate him
You don’t understand is Trump is a man. I vote for the GOP ideology and he is the head of it. I vote for individual liberty. 2nd amendment pro life pro freedom of religion pro business less hand outs. That’s what I support no matter who’s on the ticket.
That’s the vibe I get from her. I’m libertarian &amp; cant stand Trump. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump for 'shameful' claim he is 'against God'
Oh but he has blocked 11,000 people since the pandemic 😂😂. He is definitely a fraud, and was never a trump supporter. He is a narcissistic opportunist, grifter. I’m glad people see his true colors.
Mick Jagger knows what Stones song he'd play at a political rally. But Trump should ask first
Trump's Tweet is about the Local aid part, not the stimulus checks.
Trump government has given hundreds and hundreds of billions to large corporations and smaller businesses in PPP to keep people employed. But nothing for local and state government to keep police, nurses, EMTs, teachers employed. Instead they claim it's a bailout. BS. #Trumpdemic
Sounds like the only thing Trump is doing right now is helping out Beirut. What about America?
What bothers me much more than Trump is what he has exposed about many of my fellow Americans.
But there isn't going to be a wealth tax under Trump &amp; once he's gone, these kind of people won't be making deals of the same ilk. I'm not against a wealth tax, but it ain't getting rid of these people until we get rid of Trump.
Trump does not have the power to appropriate money.  This is nothing more than to gain some kind of support. My guess is Dems are drawing up a law suit, it will go to SCOTUS and he will lose.
Joe Biden is racist AGAIN but Chris Cuomo blames TRUMP for being mentall...
What a complete jerk Trump is.  30,000,000 unemployed and he talks about 1.8 million jobs like that’s great news.  10% unemployment and he brags about this economy.  What a douche.
The more they test and find the more people have had it or have it makes % of getting it and dying go down. Way more people had it then previous thought that’s why they are judging trump with his testing comment.
You really sat here and said pay attention to criminals like George Floyd. Yeah you are right you aren’t black you definitely are one of those Donald Trump Yeehaw racist supporters. Disgusting
Trump's "Executive Order" is invalid, as there's an illegal/illegitimate "gov" in place. #Treason has been committed by #Congress(House&amp;Senate), #SCOTUS, Bush, Obama and Trump, all guilty.  #PoliceStates #Tyranny #Dictatorship #Usurpation
How can President Donald Trump not get re elected. Stand strong fellow proud Americans. This leftist Cyst infecting our great land is about to be removed.
you both have destroyed NYC! I used to love going there now you have homeless in hotels you let criminals out of prison, putting covid patients in nursing homes and you graffiti in front of Trump hotels.  maybe you can fix NY they failed
....And ONLY if Trump doesn't suggest it.
Orange man bad! All you know. Good luck. I notice you weren’t mad when beloved Obama sold weapons to drug cartels that where used on border patrol agents. And that’s hard proof. But a rumor and hearsay is enough for you to condem Trump. Keep believing narrative they feed you.
Democrats Are BURNING Cities To The Ground, NYC Is Crumbling As Homeless...  via  I will not be staying in nyc till  is out of office and the BLM graffiti is removed from in front of Trump towers
Trump is in deep with Putin and we should all be afraid. He is selling us out to Russia. #TrumpIsATraitor
That’s why he uses nice words with NK. If honey gets them to the table to talk why use vinegar. How does that help. Notice NK hasn’t fired rockets in a while. They just want acknowledgment as respect. Trump gave them that and it costs nothing and in return we have a safer planet
The only way Trump wins in November is with outside interference.
Just like I don’t believe Joe meant any disrespect to blacks with his comments. And was allowed to explain. Trump explained that comment saying not the virus but the lefts fear monger reaction is the hoax. And with a death rate of .001 yah we didn’t need to kill our economy
Also im pretty sure none of the Trump supporters would say any of those things that are in Mandarin....
In reality Obama could have run for President again, the only limit is 2 consecutive terms that means he can run again for a 3rd term because Trump term broke up the consecutive.
Better yet the Dems have no idea what President Trump's plan is or if they do they know their in deep s#?t &amp; can't stop him.
This morning my 4-year old granddaughter told me Trump is the worst president ever.
Gee it's a good thing our electoral system is so great and awesome that idiots like this can try to interfere by just running a lame ass campaign. This is exactly why the Republicans are helping him
I wouldn’t worry you could say and do anything because no matter what your voters will always hate Trump more..... I just hope Kanye doesn’t drop out.
Cuomo Concedes to Trump: New York Schools Will Open
President Trump is smart, he has something up his sleeve to totally blind side &amp; trick the Dems before November election.

Trump issues order banning TikTok if not sold within 45 days - Axios
Weird that not supporting the KKK is a redeeming feature of a candidate...i expected Trump to be bad  but this awful never...the veep choice will give a large indication of how progressive/ business as usual he will be
There is a pic going round...the GOP is the copper with the knee on the neck...the DNC is the other copper just looking on...not sure if you have seen it..  Biden will be the same as Trump
There is without a doubt in my mind Trump would do what’s required to keep us out of unnecessary harms way and look out for our well being on and off the battlefield with better benefits and equipment. He is a cheerleader for those who serve.
I’ve served under every president from HWB to now and every conflict and I can tell you short of GW I have not experienced a president who appreciates and acknowledges the military more then Trump. He has gone to Dover to receive the fallen and visited the wounded more then any
Trump signs orders banning US business with TikTok owner ByteDance and Tencent’s WeChat | TechCrunch  (via
You’re right he was the problem 🙄 He reflected how most of us feel and called him out for nonsensical claims. Trump is the president of the United States and he acts like a fool, liar, coward, race-baiting douchebag on a daily basis. What do you want?
I have kids who's future is my primary interest in voting, and another 4 years of Trump is a far worse proposition than 4 or less of Biden. Minority groups, especially minority families have too much at stake to blow these things off because a candidate isn't ideal
Why do bikers love Trump?  Because both survive on hard-ass bad-ass BS and arrogance (aka "bravado")?
Trump watches TV, rage tweets,  plays golf, and rants at reporters. Yeah, poor guy needs a vacation.
The order said that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and could hand over personal information about users to the Chinese government.
Please, no more jokes, no more attempts to bond. Just tell him to stick to the script. Let Trump do our work for us. Please!
Exactly. Trump is toast after his "exhausting" propaganda tour yesterday.
So I've been seeing arguments back and forth regarding the Republicans against Trump, Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, Bill Kristol, etc. Welcome the help.
None of these Trump appointed people are on the sides of the Americans. Foreign governments have compromised these people. Why else would they be doing all of these dastardly deeds?!
As a responsible LEADER, something Trump has never been, (responsible or a leader) he adheres to the doctrine of separation of church and state.  Look it up.  Try the Constitution first.
Oh and would you accept that explanation if Trump said it right after saying if you don’t vote for me then you ain’t black? That’s all black people need, a white guy telling them how they’re misinterpreting racism. Well played.
All you said is totally true. President Trump is the only man who can save our nation.
"Trump reimposes tariffs on raw Canadian aluminum"
Trump ordered this. He is deliberately putting veterans in harm's way.
If anyone is considering voting for Kanye please think again. He doesn’t have a chance at winning. A vote for Kanye is a vote for Trump.
I'd bet a year's pay that Donald Trump doesn't even know Joe Biden is a Catholic.
Trump couldn't tell you the names of the Gospels if his life depended on it. With him, it's always projection.
The only verse Trump knows? “Make them an offer they can’t refuse.”  Don’t recall if that’s biblical.
Well I guess I’m just a dumb, deplorable, Trump supporter lol. Whooooops.  I honestly thought you were defending Biden. My bad.
Sad, but I’m afraid this tweet gives American voters more credit than they deserve.  Trump flaunting the law will appeal to many of his supporters. The only way to deal with Trump is to stop him - physically remove him and take away his power and media toys.
Indict him, arrest him, try him, convict him, imprison him.  Let the Supreme Court rule.  They will uphold it because no person is above the law and Trump felonies are flagrant, ongoing, and endanger the nation.
Trump makes me so angry. These families are suffering terrible loss and he doesn’t care at all. This loss saddens me greatly. I am so sorry for your loss.
and Trump family are masters at fake foundations.
Give me a break! This coming from tRump the evil 😈
You think the system is not broken ? The likes of trump letting thousands of people die and getting away with it !  Louisiana Supreme Court upholds Black man's life sentence for stealing hedge clippers more than 20 years ago  via
Um compared to Trump who can’t speak English or a real sentence? Makes zero sense.
Cool options to offer up- they are both dead, as far as I know, so unfortunately off the table. Oddly enough, no one alive- outside of Trump, his base, dictators, and murderers- are advocating for measures that are being advocated for in our country that will get people killed.
Who would you rather knee him, Trump or Boris?
Any vote other than Biden is dooming our country- you said it yourself. It literally DOES NOT MATTER who his VP pick is (unless it's Kayne)- anyone, literally anyone, would be better than Trump if it came to their leadership of the country.
Nope-THIS ☝️is the last person that   should highlight- this crazy person was never a trump supporter-dont get me wrong, he tried to play it to get supporters, and actually conned quite a few people-but in reality, he is mentally unstable
President #Trump finally did it. #Tiktok will be gone in 45 days. #September15 will be the final day.

Why did Trump want to ban TikTok in the first place...?
Versus Trump America? I’ll take Biden
I'm not voting for him or  Donald Trump find someone who can actually make things bearable and I'll vote.
Hell of a lot worse than saying "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that's a storybook, man." Biden said this about Obama, imagine if Trump said something like this.
Trump issues executive order banning TikTok in 45 days if it's not sold  When it’s a harmless app, ban it. But if hundreds of thousands have died from a pandemic, “it is what it is” 😡
BREAKING NEWS: The order does not state that a certain amount of money from the sale needs to be sent to the US Treasury Department, which the President has been insisting on for several days.
Trump is just a symptom. The disease still exists...the conservative mind-set to never agree with Democrats, even if the country teeters on the abyss because conservatism has turned full despotic.
Joe Biden Says That Black People All Think the Same 'With Some Notable Exceptions' (VIDEO) and #BlackLivesMatter #UsefulIdiots say Trump is racist?
Well kudos to those advisors but the ongoing problem is that their concern is obviously reasonable and moreover that Trump doesn’t need them to put the military option on the menu.  Trump is capable of starting a war all on his own.  Why do the fools in Congress take that risk?
Trump will buy the vaccines from Putin.
The Republicans basically attack their political opponents and the media. Because they've gone full-tilt radical. Even if Trump is defeated in November (still a big if) there's still a massive part of America that disdains facts and truth.
The hypocrisy is from the Republican electorate. They've been the problem all along. Trump is but a symptom, not the disease.
They’re busy covering shit up for your boy trump
You really do show up on anything Trump tweets or retweets don't you?
How long until they get a false negative and Trump gets it? Seems inevitable.

Well it’s official,  is actually a bunch of mentally unstable people. He was never a true trump supporter.
LOL   trump cant read his teleprompter, Mispronounces Thailand as  "Thigh Land" .... Not sure but maybe he was remembering his buddy Epstein and thinking about the island where they molested young girls.

Same as in 2016...For all of the shows that  has done about the ghastly Trump policies and  even invoking the low moral character of Trump in a televised eulogy...they still are holding a higher bar for Dems, which was the original problem all along.
Why They Hate Trump So Much
are still making high profile errors of 2016. Like pretending that writing in "Scooby Doo" won't help Trump. The never vote Democrat, no matter if they're the better choice is the problem.
I just wanna know why hector boom banger was wearing a fuckin Trump shirt at the bar 🤣

I don’t think either candidates are sane to be honest. Trump hasn’t lived in reality ever, but Biden is literally in cognitive decline. I choose the one who actually has a choice when it comes to deciding what sanity actually is. Biden doesn’t know anymore.
President Trump was not at the club, which is currently closed.
Oh that I agree with which is sad. Trump is a shit bag human being, BUT he’s NOT a bad President. Biden isn’t capable of speaking a sentence with full confidence but he’s supposed to run the country? What’s better a bad personality who is obsessed with succeeding or a half corpse
This is a horrible stat for humanity, but believe it or not, it's also horrible for Trump. VOTE!

Most Trump ‘muricans confuse communism and socialism regularly 🤷🏼‍♂️.  Most also don’t realize the US has socialist programs already
In my opinion, support for Trump's pandemic response or attempts to dismiss the seriousness is no different than stating support for the death and suffering of others. Such offenders will not have me wasting any more time appealing to a humanity within them that doesn't exist.
Michelle Obama's 'low-grade depression' due to Trump, pandemic | Daily Mail Online #BlackLivesMatter how depressing to have made millions, jet setting around the world, houses all over the country. give me a break boo hoo.
If you honestly hate Trump for asking campaign advice or think it’s somehow evil, how do you explain Hunter Biden doing a $1.5 B dollar transaction with them and flying there and back on a plane that operates solely on tax dollars?

My hope and guess...That Jan. 21, 2021 the state of NY will bring charges on Trump and others.
As much as I support trump, you don't know the meaning of a non peaceful transition of power if you view this as anything but.
Trump is tragically stupid. I remember the embarrassment I felt when Bush was president with all his gaffes. Trump says dumber and more insane things on a daily basis and millions of people will let their loved ones die because they take his words so seriously. Fucking terrifying
It is what it is... fuck you Trump
He’s Trump’s kind of guy.
People reporting Trump “doesn’t get it” don’t get it. Trump intentionally politicized a deadly virus for his own calculated benefit - knowing his base could be manipulated to object to taking the precautions required. “Hoax”, obstructing testing, grifting game with ppe. Get it?

As if the Democrats haven't done the same , Just watch CNN and MSNBC and watch how many names they call Trump in an hour.
Why is it conservative messaging is to the point while the media is soft? "Walking back"=changed his mind or flip-flopped, "troubling"=deceitful, illegal or immoral, "false narrative" or "alternative facts"= lies or half-truths. If Trump and GOP embrace lies then just say it.
Yes, I'd agree Trump has done more for the American people in the last 3 and a half years than Biden, Pelosi  and Obama has in their whole political lives.

This is quite possibly the largest load of horse shit Donald Trump has ever dropped. Generals my ass.
Trump would light you on fire if it meant keeping his hands warm for one minute.
Thank you for conducting such a powerful and powerfully revealing interview with Trump. Easily one of the best I've seen. You did a great job, and didn't give an inch. Thank you again.
I'm very sure that is the case... welcome to Trump-ocolypse.
Nobody is enthusiastic about Trump.  Unless you like Americans dying
School Opening ! The Democrats are deliberately withholding this evidence as a political ploy! Think of this that they are jeopardizing the lives of our children for politcal gain against President Trump! Remember this!#School OPENING.
ALL the generals!  Duh!  You’ve never seen so many generals and Trump knows more than all of the generals. He also reads books about generals, more books than you’ve ever seen. Nobody knows more about generals &amp; books about generals. #TrumpIsAMoron
Trump 159,000
Which is better ? Only two people got viruses but they both died or 1000 people got it and only two died. That’s what Trump was saying. You have a better chance of getting it but you also have a better chance of living if you get it. Why can’t they give him that credit?
I got where Trump was going. If you get virus in America and by reporters story you have a greater chance of catching it here, Trump,  if you catch it you have a better chance of living in America. Deaths per case not death per population. If I get it will I survive? Yes.

Ah, guys? Heads up. “Putin’s end goal is the destruction of the U.S.” Note Alexandra, Dick Blumenthal tweets below. Consider GOP trips to Moscow, clear pro-Putin Trump agenda, ongoing destruction of fed infrastructure. This is not coincidence. It’s all planned, just not for you.
Does Trump have the ability to unilaterally fire an Admiral or General?
He did.  I think part of the reason is that he had time to press Trump.  It wasn’t a 30 second spot by the helicopter.  Trump will never do another interview with anyone except a Fox flunky.

“It is what it is.” That’s the sentiment Mr. Trump feels for the pain that you feel, or your family, your friends, members of your community, who are facing suffering and death due to Covid-19.  The grief of losing 1,000 a day gets what amounts to a shoulder shrug.
Taxpayers are giving them the money.  Trump is merely the conduit through which the money will pass.  If he goes through with it.

Trump is a complete lunatic. He is dangerous. Someone in the Republican party needs to speak up and get his ass removed. This country is in deep trouble. Am I the only one who is afraid of this nut case?
How does Trump’s “reign” survive this?  How about this answer?  It doesn’t.

Honestly even if Biden doesn't agree it's still true. If Trump loses he's no longer protected from prosecution and he's facing State charges in NY. Biden could even publicly REFUSE to go after Trump and Trump would still likely be going to jail if Biden wins.
No way and I would be cautiously afraid of a vaccine that came out so early. I don’t trust trump at all!

when I read headlines like this all I can see is the naked propping up of Trump the media engages in because they don’t know what else to do (many of his latest endorsements have lost). Ty for always pointing this out

Is there a swanky, failing Trump golf club there?
But I would’ve respected your argument more if you would have still voted republican regardless of trump running or not.. it just sounded like you like trump tbh when stated w.o reasoning
Ok I understand the argument of democrats not fulfilling a commitment to minorities but Trump is definitely not the answer. Definitely tweaking by tryna throw that out there like it’s valid. 🤧
So your choice is trump based off “numbers” that would’ve been similar to any other president who’d have gotten elected at the time he did... only difference is trump is fucking up society at the same time ... “money” (for who exactly)&gt;&gt; Quality of life of everyday people
I seen the thread w. Jee.. now politicians is puppets and be bs’n a lot.. my question to Cheg is, Besides Donald Trump, which republican candidate would you vote for because you don’t sound too informed.. you sound like you’re repeating the news stations just like his followers
More Americans favor Capitalism over Socialism; Order over Chaos; Founding the Police over Defunding the Police; Merit-based Immigration over Open Borders; &amp; Freedom of Expression over Political Correction .  That how &amp; why Trump is leading.
There’s a group of BLM protesters in Peabody square and they’re blaring the song “fuck Donald trump” ❤️❤️
I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.

The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
God is immortal, Trump can't hurt him but he can make Baby Jesus cry.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.

The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.

Pronunciation is not my forte--I say "fort"--but pretension is. I don't say "Trump is an enigma." Rather I say "enema." I don't say "Trump is an enema wrapped in a riddle." Rather I say, "Trump is an enema wrapped in burning newspaper."
Fact: If you love and want your country 🇺🇸 to remain free, Vote Trump. If you’re not a millionaire you will be giving away your future vote for a load of bread 🍞 on the table. It’s that important. #Trump2020Victory

THIS. IS. LEADERSHIP. Donald Trump just announced that he's going to outlaw slavery.
This is completely unacceptable and a direct move by Trump to suppress votes
Pretty sure this is correct. An AAPS press release directs readers to the website.

I am sick of the right &amp; their equivocation RE: #PrezTrump. I call him out when he’s wrong but I NEVER equivocate on crap the Left NEVER DID on Obozo! I get sick when I hear passionate supporters do it. It’s nauseating. If Obozo was cannonized, I accept Trump as HE IS! #ENOUGH!!
Love when I go on drives and I see #Biden signs &amp; #BLM signs in people’s yard. Gives me hope. My new neighbor is sporting a HUGE Trump banner. It tortures me every fkn day. 🤢🤮🥴 Praying Trump gets voted out so I can be petty &amp; rub it in their face. Kanye is fking it up tho. 🤷‍♀️
Every time Trump calls COVID-19 the China Virus, it demeans my value as an American
An appropriate critique of ‘The Left’ is the unwilling nature to acknowledge any failures of democrats. Neoliberal Market Based ideology of the human condition is quite common. Trump derangement syndrome is a comfortable consequence for most. When we accept that, we can move on.
To be fair, Trump is the worst president at everything.
Ummm, he technically did spit on a child’s face, along with assaulted the child by grabbing his hand, taking his mask off and then continued to assault an employee who tried to stop him! 🙄 Guy was drunk off his rocker with no shoes on. Go figure he’s a Trump supporter. 🦇💩🤪
Maybe Trump hogs the umbrella so rain won’t expose the 666 mark under his hair fluff.
Or what if it's a backdoor way for them to oppose Trump? They can't openly come out against him, but they are able to weaken him by opposing any covid bailouts
Also, the morality piece of it is a matter of degrees. They could have not taken on the work if they wanted to take a moral stand against Trump values. There are plenty of law firms in the world.
On 9/11, Regular American Citizens prevented that plane from hitting the Pentagon. Do you have OUR backs now     or did our courageous patriots die in vain? A slow 9/11 is a 9/11 just the same. Protect us from Trump, Putin and the traitorous  Save us.
Descendants of those who voted for trump .
I can guarantee no one will be quoting any of Trump’s statements in the future for inspiration or context...
If left alone, obamacare would have went belly up anyway. One thing that stemmed the tide a little was President Trump taking away the mandate. But it's still unsustainable. Republicans aren't blameless. They haven't come up with a better alternative, which should be easy.
So apparently TikTok is ending on me and my baby sisters birthday on 09-20 thanks to trump for amazing freaking birthday......NOT.....😭🤯🤬
You’ve been brainwashed. The last 3 weeks everything has shifted. Biden is losing trust with voters on every issue and hasn’t had ONE live interview where he didn’t say something horrible. Trump meanwhile has the polls moving in his favor and the debates still to come.
It wouldn’t surprise me, West and his supporters are Trump operatives.
Dude he submitted fraudulent signatures to get on the ballot and NJ and Illinois kicked him off their ballot. We already have a fraud in office. A vote for  is a vote for  Youre literally voting for Trump
If you the DNC is so concerned with beating Trump then why are they running an incoherent bumbling fool who likes to touch girls?

Trump's last two budgets have proposed to slash Medicaid, Medicare &amp; Social Security by $2 trillion a year.
We had thousands and thousands of protesters looting burning beating each and not wearing masks. The MSM encouraged the mayhem. Now they’re questioning Trump about masks at a country club. How does the MSM look at themselves without laughing. They truly are clowns 🤡
The democrats in congress have always said "oh, Trump wants to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions." The President NEVER said that, in fact has said multiple times that he wanted to KEEP pre-existing coverage. Now he's proven it at least, even if it's not needed yet.
Then you were awaiting a happy outcome.  Now, not so sure.  And even with our happy Trump defeat outcome we will still have lost hundreds of thousand of cherished lives.  Such sadness.
Just in case anyone wasn't clear that anyone who belongs to a Trump Country Club is pure garbage wrapped in skin then the scenes from his NJ trash pile really hammered that point home to anyone with eyes today.
So OANN is the new Wikileaks and Rudy Giuliani and  are the new Julian Assange and Roger Stone. The Trump administration is organized crime aided and abetted by Bill Barr and the
Would you believe a significant chunk of those deaths were because 5 states, run by democrat governors allowed seniors with covid back into nursing homes to kill thousands of the patients living there? How is THAT on President Trump? And what does this have to do with obamacare?
Crazy, but MSNBC has a LOCK on the boomers.   Convinced the boomers that Bernie had no chance against Trump (complete lie based on ALL the polling), and refused to air any of Bernie’s big comeback in NY with AOC.  To name just a few obvious examples.
Trump is describing himself. Trump is worse than a Fake Evangelical. It's plain to see when Trump speaks there is no religious thought in any of his words.  Trump claims Biden would ‘hurt God’ and the Bible in deeply personal attack
You know that was Obama, right? You think we’re all as dumb as the Trump family.
This guy...  Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare

Nope! The only bounties tRUMP will admit to are the rolls of Bounty paper towels he got to chuck at brown people in Puerto Rico after the hurricane.

Correction, Jason:   are in court right now suing to overturn the Affordable Care Act.  That means suing to END COVERAGE for pre-existing conditions.   So, his EO means nothing. It’s a lie, a smokescreen while trump waits for SCOTUS to end our Hcare coverage.
If you want to enjoy your Friday night don’t look at the replies to Andrew Yang’s latest tweet. It’s no surprise of all Democrats in the race in February he had the most Trump supporters.
President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to “Buy American” when purchasing “essential” drugs, medical supplies and equipment rather than purchase these products from foreign manufacturers.
Obama vetted Biden. Obama calls Biden his friend.  You can’t be Donald Trump and claim your opponent is racist. Swing and a miss.
Mail is good enough for #IRS, #Stimuluschecks,  #prescriptions, tRump voting, etc Arguments against are invalid
Nobody has a lower opinion of Trump supporters than Trump himself
It’s still very possible Donald Trump is re-elected. Don’t get complacent.
You are running ads right now telling people to learn about the real Trump from people including Herman Cain. The guy who died cause he went to a Trump rally.   Not surprised that you're advertising a dead man praising Trump. Trump still thinks Fredrick Douglas is alive.
Natural selection - go for it Trump fans. Just stay away from everyone else
TikTok’s only problem is that a bunch of TikTok teens used the AP to ruin Trump’s Tulsa rally.  Dancing Teens personal information IS NOT a national security risk. If it is, we better watch out for an invasion from Granada!  They have a reason to get back at us.
The military attitude and expansion of police and “rule of law” are things Trump is for, which further baffles me as to why you would support the authoritarian expansion candidate over the libertarian candidate who is actually for small government
Where is  emergency injunction effort, that this executive act was arbitrary, capricious and intended to serve the felonious objective of interfering with an election? Stop rolling over when Trump breaks the law. Thwart his cheating. If you want a fair election.
Trump to hold news conference after coronavirus stimulus talks fall apart
Keep telling yourself that. People still have not gotten used to getting screwed on their coverage + rates. Do we really have to have this debate again? Although President Trump taking away the mandate DID help. But it also made it more financially unsustainable.
Imagine if, due to their absolute allergy to popular and sensible policy, Trump end-runs the Dems on this and healthcare in the next few months by announcing a bunch of good new giveaways. GOP would probably finance it if it gurantees them permanent SCOTUS maj, which it would
The man has lost his mind.  Why hasn't anyone invoked the 25th Amendment?  Trump is unfit to be President.  We all know it's going to be a sh*t show come Nov. 3rd.
No, the ACA already did exactly what this EO is saying. What Trump is doing here is making it look like he’s introducing something new to take credit for something that already exists.
This is insane - panicked Republicans saying Trump needs to attack Biden; they got here by doing nothing to help people, just attacking people. Their endless attacks are the problem.
Trump should invent a phone that can play music and games!
He’s trying to get by election! After that he’ll reverse his position.  Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Trump's gonna like, cancel the student debt of a huge amount of UMC white people and win the election because of it, and Dems are going to somehow be blamed for it being racist
Trump went to Penn undergrad.  Wharton is the business school.  He never got a graduate degree.  I heard that he never went to class so, pipe down.
Coverage of pre-existing conditions is a cornerstone of the ACA (Obamacare). This is not a new thing you are offering. One again TRUMP LIES.  #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks  #PreExistingConditions #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #TrumpFailsAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

I asked Chuck Fairbanks what it was like working for Trump. You me count the ways of that disaster
Trump is a White Supremacist racist. Golf club members too.  Trump doesn’t care about America. He cares about his privileged life and fragile ego.
The corruption is so complete. I’m not sure they can be stopped in their relentless drive to subvert the election - lie in Congress - openly use RU propaganda - destroy the USPS - refuse aid to Dem states hoping we will die...  To get trump re-elected. It’s their final solution.
Except that Obamacare already did this and Trump is a fucking moron
This story will not go away, despite the indifference of major news outlets. It will come back to bite Trump, who has already begun blaming it on his foreign policy and national security people. Pompeo realizes that Trump will throw him under the bus before taking responsibility.

The stock market has made a lot of people very rich during Trump’s 1st term who bought stocks guided by inside information, or the value added to Corp stock from the 2 $trillion given to them, which was suppose to filter down to all &amp; didn’t!
... So there is this 10 year old law called the Affordable Care Act, or "Obamacare." And it requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. In other words, there is already a law that does what this order "does."  And Donald Trump has been trying to kill it for years

This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
Q: How can Trump give the Kodak 377 million to turn a dysfunctioning film compay into a drug producing company while millions of unemployed americans have no money to take care of food,rent/mortgage..bills. Leaving R's and D''s struggling for a relief package?? wrong
Take care of the damn gig workers!  You will lose votes in election if you don’t!  You people are starting to disgust me and I’m a Trump supporter.. might not be for long! If u don’t take care of them, I’m voting for Biden! Do the right thing!

I dont understand..How can Trump give Kodak Company 377 million or billion and there is no comprimise for the ever struggling unemployed americans. Trump is telling Kodak to go from a film company to a drug company..like orange to apple. Its wrong. What gives???
I can’t breathe! My blood pressure it up! I deleted my Robinhood app! I just can’t look at it anymore! I’m not selling anything tho but Trump has ruined the Chinese stocks! They’ll all sink until they’ve all been removed by 2022. China will not be trading on any us stock ex!
If Texas goes blue and solidifies Trump’s loss, without a shadow of a doubt, I hope it’s a reminder to you that the “worst Dems” helped to make that happen. Imagine if you didn’t spend all your time beating up other Democratics.

$nio could sell 10,000 vehicles a month for the rest of the year it won’t matter. Trump shut down ALL Chinese stocks. They’ll all fall down. No positive company news, positive numbers, sales, earnings, etc will help Chinese stocks. Trump signing executive orders is STRONG! ⬇️😡
Yeah, another 1.4 NEW unemployment claims this week! REAL NUMBERS, NOT TRUMP NUMBERS!
Trump loves Trump, not America! Has he ever admitted any mistakes or wrongdoing? No, and he never will. He’s mentally incapable of taking any responsibility for anything. Just ask him!

$nio is expected eps is -$0.34c let’s say if it comes in AMAZING like +$2.20 lol it WONT MATTER because the fear of investors in Chinese stocks due to Trump over shadows it all

You can't tell me this monkey isn't smarter than a trump voter
It’s lower than its open, it will continue to sink. Trump shut Chinese stocks down today stupid people run in fear it is what it is
Wrong. But you go ahead and dishonestly pretend that Biden and Trump are mentally comparable.
That’s great!!! What an equal, diverse government our President has created, thanks Hilary for showing how great Trump is doing 👍
The fact that he refers to himself as a trump supporter.
"Thighland" is the funniest thing Donald Trump will ever say, and he owes it all to being a fucking idiot.
Trump and his selfishness will do anything say anything to get reelected. He's been lying his whole life, he'll keep doing it , he'll run this country deeper and deeper into the ground. He will bring more hatred and divide this country even more than it is now
He’s a black trump supporter. He can’t be THAT offended by Biden’s comments, he’s heard worse that he’s okay with.
TRUMP IS DESPICABLE!

You are such a stooge. Let's match the liar in chief's lack of a record with anyone. How about this for a starter? "Hey Joe, ever kill 160,000 people? No? How about you Mr. Trump?"
Um.... Donald Trump I can actually understand and he makes perfect sense when he speaks. I have no idea where you are coming up with this bullshit. Zero Idea... no Biden.... he is 9 donuts short of a dozen!

Absolutely- not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump. And she couldn’t even explain why she would chose Harris over Rice. This is absurd.
1) why would Harris get it and Rice not? Wouldn’t you expound on that in the article  2) a vote for anyone but Biden IS a vote FOR trump - did you not learn anything from 2016? 3) neither rice nor Harris are an imbecile Palin. Both would be fine choices
I know right. Like they expect trump in the lab finding a cure

My friend told me that she struggles with fear every day during trump’s administration. But  public response bashing trump, which went viral online, really gave her a lot of sense of belonging and made her feel safe again in this country. From then, she knows ......
I didn’t agree with the rhetoric used against R’s before but what trump is doing is beyond the pale. There is no comparing him to decent republicans of the past. You let your hatred for liberals cloud your judgement- you hate them so much you’ll accept the illiberalism of trump.
Suicide by Trump and/or suicide by the virus or both?!?!?!? Cult followers in smaller numbers
Trump loves to talk to the press by noisy helicopters.  I guess even he knows nobody really wants to hear what he says. #VoteTrumpOut

You and Trump make a great couple seeing you aquitted him..spare us chuck..Democrats gave you their covid package proposal back in May but you refused it because it had no money for big corps or tax cuts..you cut unemployment from 600 to 200.UR Scum Chuck
There’s an awful lot of people and businesses slowly moving sideways from Trump. It’s adding up and when it hits critical mass, Trump will erupt in spectacular fashion.

Trump is evil.

Wow just wow you really think that all trump fault chinesevirus was from China which got spread around by the black live matter rioters and he gave you all free money to do what you like with it and he done more for you and black Americans then Barack Obama did fact

Now Trump’s killing other country’s people. 😩
You’re a wack job! There is no difference between mail in and absentee ballots. The verification process is the same for both. Trump wants Repubby states to do mail ins and the democratic States to be restricted. Gee, that’s sounds really fair, doesn’t it?
What a stupid remark. #covid is impacting the world economy everywhere. The #Democrats are destroying the #USA now. The toplist of unemployment is led by #Democrat cities, the crime rate is exploding in the #police defunded cities etc. #Biden #Trump

Like how bout the Trump organization crimes..When are the indictments coming out??
So...loving the  news, however, isn't it going to be a very sharp weapon for the Trump re-election campaign? In terms of simple messaging. If people cared about this kind of corruption they would have paid attention to  sham university and charity.
Sad, wasn't Trump yet in NY. But NRA is a good second place trophy.
What? Not about Trump??
People are saying they would crawl on glass to vote. BUT WHY ALLOW HIM TO MAKE IT A PUNISHMENT BELIEVING THAT FEWER VOTES WILL HELP HIS CHANCES TO WIN OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM (ANOTHER TRUMP LIE)THAT HE WAS ROBBED BY THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS! #The Trump Error must end!!
I think they’re saying that “for some absurd reason Bernie left the race and now we’re stuck with Trump will kill us quicker or Biden is so useless.” Also, “it is so bad but what the hell else can anyone do? Just get rid of the Cheeto scum and then be Deridin’ Biden.” I guess.
Stop with the standard CNN accusation anytime someone calls out Trump. You don’t need CNN to tell you how he’s failed. We lead the world in cases and deaths. Are you really praising him?
I want Trump to go away
WATCH: CNN fact checker shows how Trump campaign ‘egregiously altered’ Biden photos in new ad -
This is such a gross violation of democratic norms and standards in America. One of many that will no longer stand after the Trump administration.
Oh believe me, I know. I’m in Massachusetts. Trump did everything he could back in the spring to make our Governor’s life miserable and punished us in the name of letting the Governors make the decisions. And we suffered for it. I’ll never forgive him.
You May have missed the memo since your head is shoved so far up Trump’s ass but #SCOTUS doesn’t answer to Conservatives; there is a thing called the Constitution they are beholden to. You should know about this document as you held your hand to a bible and swore to uphold it
I can't comprehend how they hate Trump so much and yet this is the guy they chose to try to beat him
Anyone who votes for Trump at this point ought to have their head examined.
You know you’ll never see a picture of trump praying    Trump never has and never will. Ask him to recite the Lord’s Prayer. My bet is that he can’t. He is not a Christian.

Wrong, Kevin! This American coronavirus is a product of Trump's incompetence and stupidity from the enabling Republican Senate, lead by heartless individuals like yourself. Having all the opportunity to fix this disaster but instead played politics with it!
Trump trying to have bigger holoacost than Adolph !

I stand corrected! Twitter actually blocked trump from tweeting today. #bravo
Dark forces is right. Trump and Flynn, Kennedy and Graham, k.i.s.s.i.n.g.
It’s a game to them Same reason why they call Trump mentally unwell while he goes on three rambling episodes a speech
I once said that Trump’s win was a symptom of a gravely ill nation. He is so grotesque a tumor that we may finally accept and fight that disease. ⁩“Trump’s racism—and that of his allies and enablers—has been too blatant for Americans to ignore or deny.”
Trump’s doing a press briefing on the daily. Get your info there. Most of its misinformation anyway so you can have him all to yourself.
As far as leaders of great organizations go   Adam Silver &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Donald Trump
Except for Hannity and right wing radio, how will Trump’s nasty made-up talking point about Biden’s age get out now while Trump, seen everyday on all media outlets, reveal his mental decline. How else to explain his expectation the Coronavirus will “magically disappear”?
Your insideous comments and misinformation campaigns are killing people..Finally! Twitter bans you from tweeting..keep it up and they will ban you for good! Twitter is not your private political platform. Keep your crap off twitter!
Fauci has been a beacon of light during this time and of course Trump wants to snuff it out.  Only liars need apply to work with Trump and he’ll take them down with him. #ItIsWhatItIs

Name me one thing that Gump Trump has done to unify our country. He is a treasonous cur who is hateful to his core. Even his own party is abandoning him and throwing support to other Republican a presidential hopefuls
Listen to Trump state many times from March until August that the Covid 19 virus is going to go away. During this time over 150,000 Republicans, Democrats, White, Brown, and Black people died. Supporters and detractors. DERELECTION OF DUTY. HE ABANDONS EVERYONE! TREASONABLE!!!
Donald Trump is a FAKE PRESIDENT!!!
Hard to imagine how this is about Trump. If she is, e.g., indicting the Trump org, it’s odd and prejudicial to call it a “national announcement.” It’s probably about a multistate investigation … antitrust or something.
Dems are hellbent on hiring illegals for cheap labor(slave wages) instead of Americans. While Dems advocate for higher minimum wage for Americans,it is their sneaky plan to hire illegals. This is what the big deal was over,make hrly wages too high.

Yea, we're getting there. She hated Trump but I'm trying to show the broader picture--they're all terrible.
Coming for you... Face reality
This is so horrific!  Donald Trump is pure scum.
Since when did Trump care about saving the country money?
At some point, does a few more $T here and a few more $T there matter ?  I think we have reached that point.  All Federal Government deficits are now free.  FED will fully fund all ZuS deficits and change zero interest.  It all comes down to Trump totally mishandling COVID-19...

Also, your flu example is quite distasteful 37k deaths vs 163,000+ a 1k die a day and what does trump do orders less testing refuses to help
You truly ar uneducated or never have worked in a field where u see people dying taking their last breaths or served a day in the military, if you only knew the truth and actually read you would find out the truth, people forget Trump was best friends with Epstein for 15 years...
I was about to say, without looking at caption those look some rich Dicks just like Trump! #TrumoVirus is exactly what’s wrong with this country, we need true leaders to run and push these bone spurs fuck out!
Did he really bring trump fans into the White House for this meeting? I hear a bunch of goons in the background
May trump get the virus
Facts hurt, trump said he would show taxes why does he hide them, he said he would decrease swamp only increased it with illegitimate secretaries and major donors who support him financially to his campaign he lies to the American people
The Trump administration’s initial proposals for the budgets for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases at CDC — a key player in the fight against coronavirus — have consistently been lower than what was spent the previous year.
Trumps violating the Hatch Act using our tax paying money to promote his campaign, playing golf instead of reading his intelligence briefings, and by the way trump did defund cdc
MassVet with you AG let’s get Trump out of office he is illegitimate POS
163,000 + deaths trump stole data and sent it to another agency to hide numbers it’s not hard to see trumps best friend is Putin who put bounties on our soldiers and he says fake news really White House said it’s true defense secretary same... trump it’s fake fuckin TraitorTrump
Puppets puppets they drink to much Fox cool aid, they forget the 1,250,000,000 for junk bonds when market crashes like it is heading don’t blame Democrats for republicans fo failure to pass funding for states, fuck Trump and his supporters
Would have been bigger, instead he blames Obama for not having it filled even though there was a surplus and a pandemic guide that was negligently dismissed and cdc was defunded by trump he is a failure and deserves a prison he acts as a dictator sending his goons to attack moms
There’s reasons we weren’t told to wear masks, hospitals across the country including police and fire didn’t have masks u tell the country to wear them and the virus really spreads! The country had a shortage because of trump if he actually didn’t increase the swamp the stockpile
Fuck trump let China help Biden! It’s not like trump wants every dictator or country to influence our elections since 2016
Will trump finally Resign for his negligence and homcides! 163,000+ dead
All BS Have you heard Biden? RACIST! I guarantee that Trump wins the black vote. He had the lowest unemployment rate in history for Blacks &amp; Latinos before the China virus. Even with Dems fighting him &amp; using the media for false propaganda -he has succeeded.
Twitter stats bro? That’s where trump gets his stats 2
Thank You 🙏🏻 They know what’s going to happen if they get caught and still do it anyway The parents are to blame not Trump
Coronavirus aid talks fall apart in meeting between Democrats, White House  “I’ve told them, ‘Come back when you are ready to give us a higher number,’” Pelosi, a California Democrat, told reporters.  FU and good luck with Executive Action !
Joe Biden is a racist because he supported segregation and just this year he said that, "if you can't tell if you're for me or Trump then you ain't black", and voted the crime bill that locked up blacks
She should be forced to resign. If anyone else violated their Co ethics policy, we’d be fired on the spot. Shit if it was Trump they’d Impeach him.

160,000+ Deaths from #TrumpVirus &amp; 1,000 people per day dying... as trump says, “It is what it is!” Free leader of killing AMERICANS AND proud to spread misinformation! Time to elect a real leader
Lol oh the trump fans and trump himself are dilusional
I actually think more disgruntled Trump voters will turn to Kanye’s joke camaign to vote then it will draw away from Biden. This will backfire on them.
Take a real leader to lead, let’s back this veteran she knows sacrifice she knows what it takes to lead! Dump Mitch and Trump let’s get  elected with

Mitch protects Rapists!
Trumps a rascist
Then we need to throw trump prison for human trafficking for Epstein
Just like your president Putin’s puppet Trump no one likes me!
Again and again Oprah shows how racist she is but nobody says a word about it Just like Biden his entire career against Black Civil Rights Bills and racist comments regularly Yet they attack Trump and call him a racist Typical isn’t it
I am NOT a Trump supporter, but, I can promise you that he is Satan’s muse, attempting to destroy the most important country on earth!Perhaps Satan will accomplish our destruction. I pray not. The so called “Evangelicals” are also owned by Satan. Period...the end!
I tried to tell everyone that Trump would attack video game companies (indirectly this time)! #GamersRiseUp #GamersUnite #WarOnGamers
Trump banning Tik Tok but not doing SHIT about gun control, condemning the officers who commit violent Murders against blacks and other people of color, and plenty of other things I could spend hours listing, just shows you how much he doesn’t care about actual important things
It’s been broken for many decades dummy. Trump is in the process of fixing it.

When did logical thinking ever factor into Trump's utterances.
Trump campaign fraud. Not even a rabbit hole conspiracy theory. Very straightforward. Gice tbis thread a read. It's pretty short.
..Kaitlyn, love your WH reporting on CNN! Trump &amp; his foolish Governors    are using students and U.S. citizens as “medical pawns”! They don’t care how many get sick or die!
The Governors who are following in Trump’s footsteps are putting their citizens in harm’s way! They don’t care if people die as long as it’s not their families !!

Giving trump time and allowing this traitor to give campaign speeches on the tax payers dime is against the law, Hatch Act violations! No worries we will make sure to prosecute all that break this law! Trump you brought in a swamp that you were supposed to drain! 161,000+ dead

Not really. They are mostly Trump enablers.
Before Trump, only Trump thought the USA could file for bankruptcy and get out from under their debt.  Now after 3 years of Trump, everyone hope he was right.
i LOVE trump being labeled “just one guy”
Ya, what Charts will Trump use to explain why he is boosting employed worker paycheck, nothing for the unemployed.  Trump will go on National TV and put a gun to his head.  Payroll Tax Cut or I shoot.  Not an unemployed person in US who would stop him.
Everywhere he or Trump shows up somebody ends up with the virus.
No, this is gross incompetence of Trump Administration on full display to the World.  Trump is mentally ill.
No Republican Senator has a say on whether there will be a deal or not.  It’s Trump’s call, will he bend over and hold his ankles enough to satisfy Democrats.
Say Trump isn’t a republican he is a fascist and a racist that’s what the Republican Party represents now
They refuse to hold trump accountable but it’s okay for one day, trump mail in votes fraud for entire US next day, Florida is fine everything else is fraud. 2.5 months Kevin and u and MoscowMitch Failed to work just like all the bills on his desk
But they simply refuse to hold  accountable fuck all these traitors from the  when the country falls to shit don’t blame Democrats make sure to blame Trump for inflating they stock market etc! Too bad this wasn’t the 1700’s all the traitors would be held
How many ways can #TrumpVirus kill us? Everything that trump does, a hidden agenda is near! Trump doesn’t care about America, he cares about himself and how to cover up all the crimes he has committed since day 1 when he colluded with Russia to become an #IllegitimatePresident
Trump cares about the great outdoors? I smell bullshit, we can guarantee that this bill has some provisions to enrich his family or his donors! Trump does not do anything for the American people unless it benefits him directly! This man is a traitor, he received help from Putin!

This is why the deep state is doing everything they can to stop him. Trump loves this great country.
It’s time for trump to resign for his actions and crimes against America to make Russia stronger!
I have not worn a mask once. The only time im going to even consider it is to go vote for trump in person.
Trump may very well decide that no deal is in his political benefit.  The more chaos the better could be his thinking.  Cook up something with China to.  Given how he looks at virus data as improving, he may not be following a data based strategy.
Let me guess... Kushner was 😂 Kushner is behind everything and trump approved it making him guilty as well
Right brilliant, that is! We look forward to tRump being an EX president.
This look came after trump says “read the Manuel!!!” and Jonathan says, very perplexed, “What Manuel?” I couldn’t stop laughing. This guy is a great reporter. He did a fantastic job 👍🏻
This is the first I heard of Trump using cocaine. 😱
Why didn’t one of you crush his statistics on the violent crime rate because it was only till 2018? He had no argument for what’s going on today and of course he did his typical it’s all Trump‘s fault because he had nowhere else to go with that argument!
Whatever happened to the director of that film?  He did a great job.  The guy that played Marty Dibergi was also a hoot.  The question is how much more bad can the tRump precedency get?  And the answer is none.  None more bad.

Don't believe for a moment that democrats will opt for mail only voting for the election. Black folks will stand in line for as long as it takes to vote him out. So don't count Trump as winning election night and democrats waiting for the mail on vote.
You know it’s bad when you wake up from a dream at 3am... about trump and say did my prayers come true, check Twitter and then say damn shit we still got the #TrumpVirus
With this administration who the fuck knows trump killing us all 159,000 Democratic hoax he says fuck him
Trump got the corona please...we need Nancy to take charge... lots of good things Mitch McConnell retires 🤣
Trump doesn't know cutting short the census will hurt Texas
Trump I have done more for black people than any other President. More black/brown people who died under his watch in this pandemic.
Time to forget what rules say you can’t release this information and let it rip and expect Biden to pardon as trump Pardons CRIMINALS
Do the American people a favor, “Take Your Heads Out of Trumps Ass!” The GOP is a bunch of hypocrites &amp; Liars! bunch of racists in the GOP! We need real leaders like   to lead this great country back from the depths of hell because of Trump &amp; GOP! ByeDon2020!
Trump is the first dictator Russian Colluding President who allows bounties on our American troops and has sanctioned Americans to die by the #TrumpVirus
Trump is a master chess player which is comforting.  He knows their play book.  I agree with you.  United we stand.  Divided we fall.👊
She wants to step in if no election results by January.  We are up shit creek if that happens.  She will reverse everything Trump did while in office.
Trump knows how to scare people
Trump signs Great American Outdoors Act
Can’t we have at least one Trump statue so we can topple it after we spray paint it black?
Just watched the Trump interview on Axios.Whenever he is lying outright his hand will not stop moving So basically I watched his hands going  back and forth through the whole interview.  Now I’m going to take a shower to get the filth off.
is a complete failure when will the GOP wake the fuck up, he is killing all of the republicans base one person at a time! The world is laughing at how the Russians pushed trump to win and the gop supports this fuck! Be prepared in November the gop will lose!

Trump could cure cancer and you clowns would be like yeah but now the world will be overpopulated....does he even care about the worlds resources...both the far left and far right are the ones really ruining this country go away...
They are going to get you prez Trump
Thank you for posting this. My jaw has never, ever, dropped like it does nowadays, until it “met” Donald Trump, and witnessed what comes out of his mouth!
PLEASE use your platform to discourage Biden from agreeing to any debates. They won't change anyone's mind, and it will just give trump's juvenile antics more air time and limelight.
I’m guessing Melania isn’t sticking around after Trump leaves office.
Anything to say about your husband palling around with his boy Jeffrey Epstein before, during, &amp; after his Presidency? Trump likes to golf. His way to unwind. Bill liked to unwind with young girls. Fact not opinion. If Maxwell survives (no “accidents”) He’s screwed and so are you
There’s so much shit that trump has done it’s hard to keep track, fires all IGs provides ventilators to russia, Russian collusion was completely there and Trump put Flynn stone and all of them up to the entire thing to elect himself as president, just as trump raped women!
Trump supporter they make real sense can’t argue with stupid
We can’t settle, we need to ensure all Americans are protected from trump and the  they are truly trying to kill us! They have protected  for far too long and we as Americans need protection from this tyrant!
Trump forgets... firefighters like myself and my wife (Rn) have been fighting to save and protect as many Americans from #TrumpVirus since 2020 because  refused to Act! Instead we fought without proper gear and protections! As a veteran Trump is what we don’t need
I suspect most States have an Eviction ban.  Trump could just call those who don’t or blast them in a Tweet.
Keep Americans First! Thank you for standing up to all the bullshit. President Trump gets it. For the people, By the people.  #americanlivesmatter
Battleground states: Arizona (11), Florida (29), Georgia (16), North Carolina (15), Ohio (18), Wisconsin (10) (99 total) all are States Trump won in 2016.
I would have loved to hear this conversation, my [Trump] family deserves a well portion of money for allowing this deal, oh by the way I want stock options too!
is unfit for office, how many times has he been going to the hospital. It’s unacceptable that trump is leading us, he needs to be thrown into a prison after being impeached!
So Trump is so stupid he forced the NY DA to put out that he is being investigated for bank and tax fraud.
Trump now wants debates to start sooner, wants more debates.  Sure sign he is losing.
I completely agree.  Two approaches; Biden announce he will not debate unless Trump releases his Tax Returns by September 15.  Or announce No Debates, period !  If they do debate, Biden gives short, concise answers, leave more time for Trump to make a fool of himself.
Shannon Pettypiece White House Reporter said that it may not be legal today on MSNBC. If the democrats try to block it for that reason Trump could blame them for not taking action to stop evictions.
Fake news!  protects Traitors 157,000+ Dead Americans and you refuse to hold trump accountable!
Trump confirmed he is open to a deal in which Microsoft or another U.S. company buys TikTok, but said the government should receive payment TrumpFraud
They bought up the fact that he like trump and the started saying some coon shit
The only thing left for Trump to do is immediately remove Cuomo as Mayor. He is the one in control of NYC. If he can't handle it (or refuses to over politics) then replace him with someone that can/will.
157,000+ dead Trump being investigated for multiple levels of fraud, pushing drugs on the American people that are killing us! Fires all IGs that investigate him, Russian collusion was there! He hires illegal immigrants and then fires them before being paid #TrumpVirus
A New York Times report shows how much money President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden are raising by ZIP code.
The reason why there is a need for a 2nd stimulus bill is cuz Republicans listened to Trump that the virus was just on the East Coast. That it wouldn't spread across the country. So Mitch decided to wait it out.
Trump is a traitor
White House Reporter just said Trump saying that he may do executive orders on UC if a bill isn't pass soon. May not be legal. The administration isn't worried cuz if Democrats try to block it they can blame them for holding up UC.
Conservatives complain about fears that Trump is already doing.
I bet Fauci Pelosi Schumer and rest of the Liberal Left Democratics are probably taking it already but will never admit it because Trump supports it
That’s a disgrace Fraud Fauci Bill Gates and the Democrats want you to pay for there vaccine when and if they get it right They want this pandemic divide and racial tension to last through the election We as Americans and people who want to remain free Need Trump 4 more years
He’s been harassed and treated like shit by the Dems since before his inauguration No other President in history has been treated this way It’s not even close It’s disgusting &amp; disgraceful All we can do is Have Trump win 4 more years to save our country
Nobody likes mike🤣😷or Trump.Biden2020 miracle express!
I've been comparing Trump to that for awhile. You got the lies and the gaslighting. The enablers like the  and the Republican Party.  The people who look away.
Do you really believe Melania can influence Trump? Mrs I was a birther too.
Is this how the GOP works now, they allow a President go rouge and do as he wants he already committed treason suggesting to change the election date, now he bypassed the senate by appointing anyone he wants! Do your job!!!
Republicans and  would rat get waste 2.5 months on vacations pushing unqualified judges instead of holding Trump accountable or working with democrats to push a bill that would help all Americans! MoscowMitch is a BITCH
Maybe trump can go back to the hospital! Do you know Walter reed Bethesda wasn’t always known as that but Bethesda, when Walter reed fucked up with treating soldiers and there was a scandal some how Walter reed got transferred to Bethesda and the name changed to Walter reed Beth.
Trump
is guilty or manslaughter 157,000+ Dead Americans, what has trump done... steal cheat from PPP $$, he goes to Walter reed and other hospitals unplanned why can’t he stay at the hospital so we can get a real leader to lead
Trump is the enemy of the people

Our democracy is at stake because trump is willing to do anything necessary to ensure that he is re-elected, we need accountability and I pray as a American veteran that the Republican Party does what is necessary to hold trump accountable
when will you do your job! I understand we all make mistakes but time is now to hold  accountable for his actions! Want to save any kind of respect for your life besides the actions that you have partaken in... hold trump accountable
Collins you supported trump and you still do your actions speak louder then words ur a traitor as well as trump

Trump wants to shut it down because a bunch of teens used TikTok to mess up his Tula rally
I agree, no debates unless Trump releases tax returns by September 15.  Biden doesn’t need the debates.
We can make America great again, by putting  in a prison cell along with his kids, he is a sexual predator who has transported kids across borders to sexually assault them can’t wait for trump to go to Walter reed etc and stays permanently
The last four years have felt like that moment on a sitcom where two characters see each other naked.  Even if we get rid of trump I feel like I’ll never be able to unsee the pale gross boil ridden raw chicken like flesh of the right.
U.S Citizens: Trump is the worst person ever because he denies us our rights to post memes, many of which are inappropriate to a younger audience (aka tiktoks main audience) and I don’t care that there are spies  Russian citizens: 6 years in prison seems fair for posting a meme
While  steals we die! Trump is a RUSSIAN ASSET AND DESERVES A PRISON CELL!!!

I think Pence wants to run for president in 2024. Pardoning Nixon caused a lot of flack for Ford. Wouldn’t it be a hoot if Trump thought he had a deal with Pence and then Pence doesn’t pardon him. Trump’s Twitter finger would get worn out.

a couple of questions you might address in your Podcast; Should Biden debate Trump ?  I say NO.  Give Trump a September 15 deadline to release his tax returns, else no debates.  Second, should Biden commit to being a One Term President ?

It’s more like Trump will refuse to debate Biden because Biden will destroy trump and make him look bad
If your ever feeling like your not smart enough or your education didn’t give you anything. Just comment on a trump tweet and enjoy the comments back. You will be surprised how smart you are.
There should be no debates unless Trump releases his tax returns by September 15.

Listen Mike, you are beginning to sound just like Trump, in that, if things do not go your way, you call out people as disappointments.  Judge Roberts is following the rule of Law in his mind.  So sorry that you believed you had a monopoly of people, departments, courts, etc.

The greed and cruelty in the Republican party is beyond reprehensible.  If  didn't wait 3 months to take any action on Trump Virus, fewer people would need unemployment benefits.  People are being punished for something they have no control over.
Donald Trump has revealed the depths of the country’s prejudice and forced Americans to reckon with a racist system, writes
Who’s more to blame for the us outbreak of the Chinese Virus, trump or China!
Donald Trump formally accepts the GOP’s 2020 presidential nomination.
As  documents in “Hiding in Plain Sight” the Trump-centered network I’ve described above is only one of many inside and outside the United States that are degrading our Republic. This systems view applies to them all.  24/29
7. Members of the journalism establishment, to varying degrees.     a. Some, such as Fox News, are directly aligned with Donald Trump’s interests.  20/29
3. Elements from other criminal networks, both domestic and international, with joint interests in real estate, money laundering, and other activities. (See, for example, “House of Trump, House of Putin” by   18/29
Donald Trump’s coherence network is a large and interconnected one with a long history. That is the basis of its power, not the person at the center.  16/29
I see this failure to distinguish between the individuals and the network in just about all political commentary about Donald Trump. My belief is that (with a few exceptions) a focus on the individuals will lead to weak interventions.  14/29
There is a large and powerful combined network of coherence pathways touching Donald Trump. Many writers have documented the origins of this network.  My purpose here is to assert that the power is not primarily in the individuals but in the network itself.  12/29
My view: I see Donald Trump as a severely damaged person with a thoroughly constructed facade that hides a personal emptiness. This facade works with almost everybody to block further probing into what’s behind his behavior.  4/29
These might be reasonable conclusions based on his behavior alone, but they don’t take into account the networks that contains/contained him. (By using the past tense “contained” I refer to partial information I have about his family history from interviews of Mary Trump.)  3/29
What I see written about Donald Trump is typically some combination of: 1. He is an evil genius (the narcissism goes here). 2. He is a well-connected criminal. 3. He is stupid. 4. He is a brilliant showman.  2/29
A contrary view of Donald Trump.  (This systems view of politics is a placeholder for future work that I expect to succeed and replace it.)  1/29

Unlike  and the Trump administration, Roberts has some integrity, and respects the rule of law and the Constitution.  Siding with trump and his lunacy is not one of his job requirements.
Sitting on the floor , giving a dog but scratches.   2 things trump would never do.everything trump says is a lie and never has the hard facts to prove that its not a lie
Mike Huckabee, debunks Trump myths
Probably just quoting Jeffrey Epstein. Trump does that. I believe that's where his "yum yum" term comes from.
I just don't get it. Trump has proven time and again that he is cuckoo for cocoa pops--why is he still in office? Shouldn't he be committed or something?
When Hell freezes over. The man doesn't have the balls to say anything to his "Buddy." Putin must have something real good on Trump; Our fearless leader is a quivering mass of jello whenever he encounters him.
Bet it was a Supreme Court Appeals Judge trump stacked up. Perverse.
Rush called it the common cold. Trump called it a democratic hoax. Sean hannity called it a democratic hoax. Trump said we should look into injecting disinfectant.
👀 Elliott Abrams to replace Brian Hook as Trump's Iran envoy
I think God was hurt more when Trump broke the "Thou shall not sleep with a porn star while thy wife is pregnant" commandment.
Then Biden would win. What’s your point? I’m white I’m not voting for Trump
They were donated items organized and sent by our state dept. trump sent them.

Get the trashy Trump crime family out of The White House!
#MA04 needs someone who will hold the president accountable on day one.  has has taken on the Trump admin 50+ times, called for his impeachement, and has called for the release of his tax returns unlike other candidates in this race.
Where are these facts and why is Bill Clinton not facing any charges?  The facts have not come out yet. There is circumstantial evidence with both Clinton and Trump. They both have questions regarding women. I’m not going to bank on “grab ‘em by the pussy” trump.
I'm sorry but I'll believe he will debate Trump only when I see them 2 on stage. Dont forget, the Bidens lie as easily as they breath.
Just drove behind a Q weirdo with a Trump 2020 sticker, a Pepe sticker; and that one long hashtag with the Ws and shit. That’s quite the thing to see in the wild.
He gave a political speech because the victim would still be alive if Trump had acted immediately.
Trump lies so fluently, I could puke.
This is how I want people to interview Trump. Unfortunately, Swan will probably never be given the opportunity to speak with him again, and that's why reporters can't be aggressive with their questioning... they'll lose access for doing their job well.
I feel October is going to be one crazy month!  October Surprise &amp; the Trump card could be played???
therefore, i will gladly vote for biden in the hopes of dodging the bullet that is trump and i will be proud of it.
Wait, did TikTok fall off the back of a truck? Now Trump wants a cut? 🤣
What a kiss-ass frigging joke the entire Trump administration is.  How Ridiculous???
Sadly this was predictable. All cults lead their followers to early graves. The Cult of Trump has always been a death cult. More will come, sadly.
Are you referring to the pedophilia of donald trump?  Jim Jordan? It seems to be a favorite pastime in the trump circle.
i agree, which is why we should get trump out of office
That was his father.  Secondly, everything Biden has done on race is factual.  All Trumps is media generated.  You dodge facts every time.  Look u vote for your racist and ill vote for the media hated Trump.
Trump is a host.
Bullshit. Not only does she have the people skills, she's also one no-nonsense tough cookie. Is the "white lady" a Trump supporter?
How can you blame Trump you Moran you are the one in charge look in the mirror and get your police back to work
Clinton left office with a balanced budget, Bush pissed it all away on his tax cut, and wars. Obama had a steadily dropping deficit, Trump has just about crashed the economy, also another tax cut for the wealthy.
Peter Navarro, Director of Trade and Manufacturing in the Trump administration, an economist, has no business going on TV to opine on the use of Hydroxychloroquine, which he erroneously told viewers, is preferable to Remdesivir to treat Covid.
You know what, vote in person if you can. Not because the Democrats are trying to steal it, but because Trump is. The Republican Party-stealing elections since 1876!
has my support because he's day one ready! With AG Healy, he took on the Trump admin 50+ times, sued ExxonMobil, and put Purdue pharma out of business for fueling the opioid crisis. You can ask Dave a question here-  #MA04 #MAPOLI
I LIKE YOU MR. PRESIDENT! 😊👍
After Donny SHIT Trump  LOSES the election,  His "Family" "Crime Family"  will be using   China $$$ and   Russia $$$ to   Help His "Foreign Patriarchs" "i.e. Russia and China"  Destroy America; like he's using his   Daddy's   Confederate KKK $$$ now.
If Eric Trump had a twin, that would be Blondie, pre cosmetic surgery. Remember Laura Ingram's twisted face before the knife. The ugly shines through on these monsters.
So Deutsche bank is trying to shake off Trump and Kushner... better late than never I guess.
What could go wrong? The Trump Virus out of control, hurricanes...
Actually it wasn’t debunked by snopes. She dropped the lawsuit because she said her life was being threatened. I don’t trust “grab them by the pussy” Trump at all.
Trump lies, people die!
Most of Antifa is peaceful. Don’t let a few extremist ruin the message. Right now it’s White people causing problems in Portland. They are only doing that because of Trump’s “ private” police.  Notice you didn’t say anything about the White Supremacist.
Support a President who attacks our Constitution with his attacks on the free press, peaceful protestors etc. Millions sick, millions unemployed, historic GDP drop. Our county can’t take much more of Trump
We’ll be greater than before once the Trump crime family vacates The White House! #YesWeCanAgain
Dems wanted it to be more.  And they still do with their 3 Trillion package which includes billions for pet projects for liberals.  Trump had to spend money to bail out America from a virus developed and unleashed by China on the world.  No leader has ever faced this!!!
A virus from made and spread by China devestated the world!   Countries shut down!!! Unemployment goes up!  Not anything to do with Trump economic policies!!! C’mon man. You really can’t be serious?!
Will it be a fair election Mr Meadows? Stop Trump from tampering with our decision!
Louis DeJoy will do to USPS what Betsy DeVos is doing to public education, destroy it. They both PAID TO PLAY. Bought their seats just to destroy the institutions they took an oath to serve...like every Trump appointee. Corruption is now legal in this country.
Bunch of bs. If he was concerned about issues with USPS why wait to fix it until election year. BTW the only issues are the ones he’s creating himself. Longtime Trump ally and fundraiser Louis DeJoy paid for his seat just like Betsy. His his is to destroy USPS.
I only need to read a few of the unhinged replies of your supporters to understand that four years of you, or more accurately your VEEP pick, will forever alter America in such a way as we may not be able to recover. I’m not saying I’m 100% for Trump, but I’m 100% against you.
Line 95, Trump Old Post Office at a hotel made over $45 million dollars!?!? I’m I reading this right? A hotel post office can make over $45 million dollars!? 🤔
No that would be COVID but sure let’s blame Trump because we don’t like him.
I agree. That is what triggered Trump’s people.
its hard to do when their lips are alll over trump`s ass
Biden is intelligent?!!!!  Not to mention a factual undeniable racist!! Didn’t want his kids in a racial jungle, FOUGHT for segregation, mentors KKK, “u ain’t black”, “hv to hv an Indian accent to go into 7 Eleven/Dunkin’!  Wake up man!!! Media makes Trump into racist.  Biden is!
Yup it’s his fault for these idiots don’t wear their mask and doing what they’re told but go out there rioting and looting and protesting instead of staying home like they should so the coronavirus doesn’t spread. But yes blame Trump asinine.
Agreed he should hv vetted that Dr. But that’s 1 Dr. Hundreds of others from some prestigious hospitals agree with Trump.  That’s where he got that info. Fauci has made many mistakes including masks.  Congressional panel found Trump actions saved thousands.  Fauci agreed 100%
He has taken away no medical ins, tax relief benefited everyone because the rich like liberal Amazon provide tjousands of jobs.  Wages up for all.  Obama stripped the CDC leaving Trump to handle worst virus in modern times. Your points are from the media. Not facts.
He put the travel band on in March and sleepy Biden wanted to keep it open but that’s ok because it’s not Trump.
Because he can’t teach idiots to do the right thing and stay home and wear a mask plus these protests don’t help makes it worse. But let’s just blame Trump because that’s the only thing we can do. I can’t believe people actually believe it’s his fault it’s asinine.
Trump’s gonna ban Tik Tok and a bunch of eboys are gonna show up at the White House just going fuuuuuuuuuck what’s popping

Next we'll learn that Kodak CEO and Trump are friends. The swamp is overflowing!
One can’t receive an application for a ballot, or a ballot without being registered to vote. A birth certificate, social security card, driver’s license or other suitable ID needed to register. He’s as stupid as Trump or gaslighting.
Hillary won the popular vote by over 3 million votes. Republican gerrymandering is the only reason Trump was handed the election.
It’s the fault of Donald Trump!
Facts hurt.  Slavery was longer than that and It doesn’t stop Dems from race baiting. Trump has done more for seniors and minorities than the media will let u believe, including the lowering of the price of meds for Medicare.
So he donates 2miilion to Trump and was given Postmaster General job so he can destroy it. Just like Betsy DeVos. A paid seat to destroy our country.
Right!  Trump should be way ahead!
The idiocy and racism is apparently with Democrats who are voting for a factual racist all his life who supports the type of govt people are fleeing to come here.  Trump is a media made racist who supports the very thing that made this country the best in the world, capitalism.
Pompeo shares a lot in common with Barr and Trump, including an arrogant sense of his own importance and authority. I wonder how that investigation of his lavish abuse of our money is going.
I think we’re going to see another era of one term presidents over the next decade. Trump will likely lose, Biden will decline a 2nd term and his VP will likely run and win but party fatigue will lead to a GOP win in 2028. By the end of the decade we’ll see the 48th President.
As the Trump Virus kills hundreds of thousands, nice to be oblivious to reality.
Yet the Trump Virus is out of control. Accessible testing sites are either not available or affordable.

Yes, because “no more tweeting” is the most concerning thing about a potential Biden presidency. 🙄 You’re going to need a better tactic than, “I won’t tweet like Trump does.” We all know that technological advances of the last 10 years befuddle you, and that’s no malarkey!
How many times since he became president could Trump write “WW” in his scorecard?

Beat cancer but couldn't beat the Trump virus.
At Trump’s direction, no doubt.
Shh, don’t tell Trump, and all the other perps.
Oh shut up and stop trying to deflect the heat from the Trump family circus!!!
Trump will never "learn his lesson." because he has no soul or conscience. He'll go to his grave thinking he did a "great job." He's delusional.
Trump must be awfully proud of the "terrific" job he's doing.
Then they will blame the spike in virus on republicans and Trump.
Good news is we test more than any other country, our death rate is lower and still way less than the 2 million Dr Fauci said we would have.  People may not like Trump personally, but 150K with no vaccine is a success story to this point.Tom Cotton has submitted legislation to do just that! I agree blocking of Fed funds, our tax dollars, to those cities and states!  Hope the people realize their voting error! Vote Trump! Law and Order and America First, President
China, Russia, Iran and God knows who else, don’t want Trump to win because he plays hardball!  Biden would wimp out and keep feathering his nest especially with China. POLICIES OF THE LEFT WOULD SHAFT OUR WORKERS!
What a sharp guy our President is. Love that he won’t take crap from anyone!  is going to rip Biden apart in the debates! Check Biden for “Hearing Aids”  WATCH: Trump Wrecks Reporter Who Complains About Crowd Size at Press Conference
Funny how Democrats including Schumer are trying to sound a tiny bit moderate. They’re realising that they pushed us too far and it’s backfired.   Don’t be fooled! Now snake Schumer is saying schools must reopen or economy will hurt.   What has Trump been saying? Dems worried!
Notice. Joe Biden’s team is constantly having to clean up over all his gaffs.   As President Biden would put China first and US Workers last. Must re-elect Trump or we are finished and will be living under tyranny.
Watch out for #Barr - he's the smartest guy Trump's got  - they'll send #PeterNavarro ( out to do the knee-capping, but AG has the chops. Check out how he excoriates U.S. Biz for helping #China win (not just easy targets -Hollywood, &amp;c.) Wow
Nope, everyone, except the 50 million idiots in the US who believe Trump and the Fox WH broadcasts, are with you.
When the senate let trump off the hook at the farce of an impeachment trial, they made it okay to rig an election.  Therefore it’s open season for every country on Earth to try and fuck us up.
Yes, good riddance to all of Trump's disciples
Don’t get me wrong I do not support trump at all, but I’m not gonna support a man that questions my blackness based on if I vote for him
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
Judge nixes Trump bid to delay suit from woman alleging rape
He isn’t talking about the culture , but political views , he didn’t say all black people are the same Hence “notable exceptions”  This is what Trump wants you guys to believe smh hear Biden’s statement
It’s time to end you trump can’t wait for November
That would leave Pence (who worries me greatly). I'd really like to see trump humiliated and emasculated with a resounding Biden victory. We will pay a very heavy price daily with trump in office....sigh.
This is how I want to feel...but not gonna happen with Trump in office.
Oh, goodie, another criminal in the trump mafia family.
And y'all still wanna come for Trump lol. Good job Biden. #BidenIsARacist
Tic-tac according to Trump
Oh, I like this idea.   Better have Trump put $300,000 in escrow or no one will ever see it.
And none of what he says even makes a bit of sense. “Hurt the Bible” is nonsensical. If anyone did something close to that it was Trump himself when he posed in front of the church clutching it like a copy of Mein Kampf.
Is that why the Trump Tax Scam gave $18 billion to J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley instead of struggling small businesses or American families?

So what has trump done for us, we elected him to POTUS, Paid him a salary, gave him a place to live, all I see is he showed us that we would be better off without a POTUS if his main intention is to get re elected, seriously he’s ruined the country sowing division #DumpTrump2020
Idiot, you asked America before you were elected “what do we have to lose “ apparently a TON, and now that you tanked the economy which was the only thing you thought you were good on, now we really don’t have anything to lose by going with Biden, we only lose the loser. Trump

Did trump face plant into a bucket of orange paint?
Personally, I don't think Biden should debate trump until he releases his taxes.
Please. Hundreds of guys in the union support trump right now. Knock that shit off.
If it's really a national security risk, it would be treated like Grindr and forced to be sold to a US company or spin off into separate, US-based company, but Trump is even against that...
It doesn't bother me that hes not a union supporter. I'm a union guy and I still vote trump. Its funny how we were all told we should embrace Obama care and about a year after, our union president said it was a mistake.
I agree with that, but Trump said he doesn't want tik Tok to be sold to an American company. This is turning into a personal political issue with cyber security as the side.
No it wasn't. The end of that administration was on an extremely slow incline. Trump gave it a major jump start by eliminating regulations and bringing jobs back to America.

In case anyone is interested...the House passed the Heroes Act in May and sent it to the Senate on 6/1.  (This would be those "do nothing Democrats" that Trump like to complain about.)  You don't have to believe me. The Heroes Act is available at

I think what their saying is not voting for Biden is voting for Trump
This is so true! Trump can't get a hold on Biden, because they are so 'similar' - older whiter males. That's the secret of Biden's success. Trump can't find a wedge issue, based on race, or gender, or political extremism. It's an apples-to-apples race, and Trump is the bad apple.

In my original response I even said that the results didn’t make a difference to me bc I didn’t like either candidate so how didn’t it go my way? I was simply pointing out that “we” did not vote trump in.
Collectively trump did not get voted in😂 Again, he did not win the pop vote. He literally had less people vote for him. Which means that more people voted for Clinton instead if you didn’t know.
The tweet I replied to says “we voted in trump” which is not totally true. Did you miss that part?
The people voted for Hillary not saying that she would’ve done better bc they both suck. But just pointing out that trump was not voted in by the people he lost the pop vote

The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.

I am sick of the right &amp; their equivocation RE: #PrezTrump. I call him out when he’s wrong but I NEVER equivocate on crap the Left NEVER DID on Obozo! I get sick when I hear passionate supporters do it. It’s nauseating. If Obozo was cannonized, I accept Trump as HE IS! #ENOUGH!!
Love when I go on drives and I see #Biden signs &amp; #BLM signs in people’s yard. Gives me hope. My new neighbor is sporting a HUGE Trump banner. It tortures me every fkn day. 🤢🤮🥴 Praying Trump gets voted out so I can be petty &amp; rub it in their face. Kanye is fking it up tho. 🤷‍♀️
Every time Trump calls COVID-19 the China Virus, it demeans my value as an American
An appropriate critique of ‘The Left’ is the unwilling nature to acknowledge any failures of democrats. Neoliberal Market Based ideology of the human condition is quite common. Trump derangement syndrome is a comfortable consequence for most. When we accept that, we can move on.
To be fair, Trump is the worst president at everything.
Ummm, he technically did spit on a child’s face, along with assaulted the child by grabbing his hand, taking his mask off and then continued to assault an employee who tried to stop him! 🙄 Guy was drunk off his rocker with no shoes on. Go figure he’s a Trump supporter. 🦇💩🤪
Maybe Trump hogs the umbrella so rain won’t expose the 666 mark under his hair fluff.
Or what if it's a backdoor way for them to oppose Trump? They can't openly come out against him, but they are able to weaken him by opposing any covid bailouts
Also, the morality piece of it is a matter of degrees. They could have not taken on the work if they wanted to take a moral stand against Trump values. There are plenty of law firms in the world.
On 9/11, Regular American Citizens prevented that plane from hitting the Pentagon. Do you have OUR backs now     or did our courageous patriots die in vain? A slow 9/11 is a 9/11 just the same. Protect us from Trump, Putin and the traitorous  Save us.

I can guarantee no one will be quoting any of Trump’s statements in the future for inspiration or context...
If left alone, obamacare would have went belly up anyway. One thing that stemmed the tide a little was President Trump taking away the mandate. But it's still unsustainable. Republicans aren't blameless. They haven't come up with a better alternative, which should be easy.
More gaslighting bullshit.  For the rubes:  this is ALREADY law. Ok?  It’s part of....wait for it...Obamacare.  And trump’s lawyers have been in court trying to KILL IT   MAGA: you are being played
So apparently TikTok is ending on me and my baby sisters birthday on 09-20 thanks to trump for amazing freaking birthday......NOT.....😭🤯🤬
You’ve been brainwashed. The last 3 weeks everything has shifted. Biden is losing trust with voters on every issue and hasn’t had ONE live interview where he didn’t say something horrible. Trump meanwhile has the polls moving in his favor and the debates still to come.
It wouldn’t surprise me, West and his supporters are Trump operatives.

The democrats in congress have always said "oh, Trump wants to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions." The President NEVER said that, in fact has said multiple times that he wanted to KEEP pre-existing coverage. Now he's proven it at least, even if it's not needed yet.
Then you were awaiting a happy outcome.  Now, not so sure.  And even with our happy Trump defeat outcome we will still have lost hundreds of thousand of cherished lives.  Such sadness.
Just in case anyone wasn't clear that anyone who belongs to a Trump Country Club is pure garbage wrapped in skin then the scenes from his NJ trash pile really hammered that point home to anyone with eyes today.

Would you believe a significant chunk of those deaths were because 5 states, run by democrat governors allowed seniors with covid back into nursing homes to kill thousands of the patients living there? How is THAT on President Trump? And what does this have to do with obamacare?
Crazy, but MSNBC has a LOCK on the boomers.   Convinced the boomers that Bernie had no chance against Trump (complete lie based on ALL the polling), and refused to air any of Bernie’s big comeback in NY with AOC.  To name just a few obvious examples.

Trump is describing himself. Trump is worse than a Fake Evangelical. It's plain to see when Trump speaks there is no religious thought in any of his words.  Trump claims Biden would ‘hurt God’ and the Bible in deeply personal attack

If you want to enjoy your Friday night don’t look at the replies to Andrew Yang’s latest tweet. It’s no surprise of all Democrats in the race in February he had the most Trump supporters.

You are running ads right now telling people to learn about the real Trump from people including Herman Cain. The guy who died cause he went to a Trump rally.   Not surprised that you're advertising a dead man praising Trump. Trump still thinks Fredrick Douglas is alive.

TikTok’s only problem is that a bunch of TikTok teens used the AP to ruin Trump’s Tulsa rally.  Dancing Teens personal information IS NOT a national security risk. If it is, we better watch out for an invasion from Granada!  They have a reason to get back at us.
The military attitude and expansion of police and “rule of law” are things Trump is for, which further baffles me as to why you would support the authoritarian expansion candidate over the libertarian candidate who is actually for small government
Where is  emergency injunction effort, that this executive act was arbitrary, capricious and intended to serve the felonious objective of interfering with an election? Stop rolling over when Trump breaks the law. Thwart his cheating. If you want a fair election.
Trump to hold news conference after coronavirus stimulus talks fall apart
Keep telling yourself that. People still have not gotten used to getting screwed on their coverage + rates. Do we really have to have this debate again? Although President Trump taking away the mandate DID help. But it also made it more financially unsustainable.
Imagine if, due to their absolute allergy to popular and sensible policy, Trump end-runs the Dems on this and healthcare in the next few months by announcing a bunch of good new giveaways. GOP would probably finance it if it gurantees them permanent SCOTUS maj, which it would
The man has lost his mind.  Why hasn't anyone invoked the 25th Amendment?  Trump is unfit to be President.  We all know it's going to be a sh*t show come Nov. 3rd.
No, the ACA already did exactly what this EO is saying. What Trump is doing here is making it look like he’s introducing something new to take credit for something that already exists.
This is insane - panicked Republicans saying Trump needs to attack Biden; they got here by doing nothing to help people, just attacking people. Their endless attacks are the problem.
The fact that it's taken 40 years and President* Trump for smart, well-educated Republicans to start abandoning the party, when Lee Atwater said this in 1981, tells you all you need to know about normalization and privilege.

He’s trying to get by election! After that he’ll reverse his position.  Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare
Desperate times call for desperate measures. Trump sees his re-election slipping away. His shitty base is not large enough, he needs more voters.
Trump's gonna like, cancel the student debt of a huge amount of UMC white people and win the election because of it, and Dems are going to somehow be blamed for it being racist
Trump went to Penn undergrad.  Wharton is the business school.  He never got a graduate degree.  I heard that he never went to class so, pipe down.

Trump is a White Supremacist racist. Golf club members too.  Trump doesn’t care about America. He cares about his privileged life and fragile ego.
The corruption is so complete. I’m not sure they can be stopped in their relentless drive to subvert the election - lie in Congress - openly use RU propaganda - destroy the USPS - refuse aid to Dem states hoping we will die...  To get trump re-elected. It’s their final solution.
Except that Obamacare already did this and Trump is a fucking moron
This story will not go away, despite the indifference of major news outlets. It will come back to bite Trump, who has already begun blaming it on his foreign policy and national security people. Pompeo realizes that Trump will throw him under the bus before taking responsibility.

I'm sorry. What are you talking about?  There is no proof of Trump colluding with Russians. Mueller is clear on this.  Re: Clinton - the Steele dossier was financed by her campaign, fed by Russians, and peddled by the FBI, who knew better.  Durham is coming. Stay tuned.
Proof? Of what? Does anyone have to prove that something did not happen?   FBI has demonstrated that they were liars and fabricators.   I am confident that the case was closed on whether Trump and Russians colluded on the 2016 election when the Mueller investigation was closed.
If this was as obvious as you believe, Schiff would have been all over it. Instead, the theory of Trump's involvement in collusion with the Russians did not amount to a hill of Schiff ... evidence.

Ask trump! It's his train wreck. 🙁
But I would’ve respected your argument more if you would have still voted republican regardless of trump running or not.. it just sounded like you like trump tbh when stated w.o reasoning
Ok I understand the argument of democrats not fulfilling a commitment to minorities but Trump is definitely not the answer. Definitely tweaking by tryna throw that out there like it’s valid. 🤧
So your choice is trump based off “numbers” that would’ve been similar to any other president who’d have gotten elected at the time he did... only difference is trump is fucking up society at the same time ... “money” (for who exactly)&gt;&gt; Quality of life of everyday people
Biden should just come out and just recite verses of the Bible and then Make trump do the same during the debates and when he can’t.  Just look at him and say you must of been to busy paying off porn stars to learn the Bible.

It means never supporting anyone who has gone along with Trump and not stood up to him ... so currently I would say yes it means never Republican with the exception of Mitt Romney.
I seen the thread w. Jee.. now politicians is puppets and be bs’n a lot.. my question to Cheg is, Besides Donald Trump, which republican candidate would you vote for because you don’t sound too informed.. you sound like you’re repeating the news stations just like his followers
More Americans favor Capitalism over Socialism; Order over Chaos; Founding the Police over Defunding the Police; Merit-based Immigration over Open Borders; &amp; Freedom of Expression over Political Correction .  That how &amp; why Trump is leading.

There’s a group of BLM protesters in Peabody square and they’re blaring the song “fuck Donald trump” ❤️❤️
I could be wrong, but in my opinion trump keeps the political engine working with give and take. If the democrats get the office with Biden they will be able to railroad everything. Republicans hate Trump, which keeps things somewhat balanced.
Trump is a piece of shit. But he is capable of being a leader, whether you like the direction or not. Biden terrifies me. The people who will get control of the office behind the scenes, while joe figures out what day it is is scary. Least with trump you have checks and balances

So far, trump has invited Russia, China and Ukraine to interfere in our elections.  Did I miss anyone?
I think it's very clear that trump is only interested in loyalty to him. Not loyalty to our country.  Not independence and adherence to laws.

The democratic leadership failed us. 4 years and a presidential seat ripe for the taking and they gave us Biden. Democrats are now forced to vote for Trump or ignore reason and vote for Biden just to be against trump. I for one vote for the best option, it’s sad Trump is that.
A little free lesson in Boolean logic for you: If you don't vote for Biden, then (by definition) you don't *actively oppose* Trump.  You can vote or not-vote however you like. You can prevaricate all you like. But that's how binary choices work.  Either own it, or kindly STFU. 🤷
Trump is actually leading. Chris Wallace &amp; the Media are in denial.   Furthermore, Trump would relish more debates with Biden. Biden is cognitively challenged. The more he’s exposed. The more it’s exposed. The more votes he loses.  Trump knows that only so well.   Chris doesn’t.
Do people do “tRump” because they think it fools the Twitter algorithm? (It doesn’t)  Or do they do it because you read it as “t-rump”? (That’s funny)

Trump Considering Replacing Pence with Confederate Statue
I’m choosing joy today. When I woke up I didn’t see Donald Trump in the mirror. I’d say that’s a victory.
To be fair, he doesn't have any resorts or golf courses there... when *would* he have learned how to pronounce Yosemite? While the rest of us were in grade school, he was busy with Fred Trump, participating in "take your child to shady real estate practice and tax avoidance" day.
The last six months?  Joe has worshipped his god more in the last six minutes than Trump has in a lifetime. 😊

You have no choice, stupid one.  It is a state decision, not the Federal Governments.  Secondly, Trump is blatant in the fact Democratic Governors are crooked while  Republican Governors are not.  Shameful!  President for all of the people....HA.  That is why he will lose!!!
Listen Mike, you are beginning to sound just like Trump, in that, if things do not go your way, you call out people as disappointments.  Judge Roberts is following the rule of Law in his mind.  So sorry that you believed you had a monopoly of people, departments, courts, etc.

Sitting on the floor , giving a dog but scratches.   2 things trump would never do.
Not to mention the literal neocon war criminals who are backing biden and controlling the narrative against Trump. I'd rather fight them than demented fascist incels 4chan rejects.
Literally every negative thing you could say about Biden is more true of Trump, and it will be easier for the far left (people like me) to fight against a biden administration than it is for us to fight Trump because we won't have centrists liberals screwing with our message.
Look let me clear something up, I can and do agree that biden is week, lacks enthusiasm from the left not his base,, and both he and trump are senile as all hell. But that doesn't matter, Biden is winning, and if you held a gun to my head I would prefer him to Trump.
I'm so looking forward to learning of all the lawsuits that will be filed against trump after Jan. 20.  The guy definitely belongs in prison.  Can he be charged with crimes against humanity for his willful neglect of Trump Virus and lying about it's severity?
You think that’s impressive? People say Trump is the greatest pretend fire truck driver the world has ever known.There are no hotels on his golf resorts. It’s private so members only on property. I’m sure there has to be golf cart fees because they have to follow him everywhere he goes. Obama left the White House in weekends &amp; had to pay to stay where he went. Trump &amp; his family don’t.
Why don’t u tell us what it is?It’s not”Kung Flu”or”The Chinese Virus”! It’s COVID-19. The intelligence of tRUMP is reflected in his staff,especially when KellyAnne Conway said the”19”in COVID-19 means it is the 19th Virus. It actually means the year 2019 when the Virus appeared!
Right now the media I believe is just as scared as many Americans of what this country will be like if Trump wins again. Biden isn't the long-term answer. But he's a big improvement over Trump in my opinion. You can argue that if you'd like. But I'll stand by my word.
That's bull and you know it. The media goes after where the story is. Trump's full of lies and corruption, a perfect storm for the media, Google tells all stories true or not.
The biggest hoax of all is tRUMP! After 3+ years it’s time to get rid of it!
“We the people” in this case are all the Trumpsters that bow to their idol like little sheep. The only thing they see &amp; hear are tRUMP’S lies!

And Obama was not only a black man but a good man. And yet it took Trump just a few months away from election to do it. People need to take off their Kool-Aid glasses

Every American needs to watch Tik Tok before they vote for Trump!
Trump’s problem with TikTok is that he got caught watching it all day.  If TikTok is Trump’s priority, he needs to be out of the Presidency before November.  He needs to be committed now!

BY TYLER O'NEIL: Seattle Mayor Again Blames Trump After Rioters Blew Open a Police Station Using a Van Full of Explosives
Maybe more...we’re are the ones not facing up to the fact the United States government is broke!    Our hard work &amp; our faith in God &amp; Country are the reasons the USA still functions in spite of Trump!
Think it’s the municipal order bit. Here, we are still in Phase 3 of reopening MA.  It’s a nationwide epidemic &amp; Trump dropped the ball.  He even threw away the pandemic guidebook prepared by the Obama Administration out of his jealousy of Obama.  What kind of name is Trump?
Really? Trump let us know what he likes to grab right from the beginning! And appearances, that must have been the day when Melania was giving birth, he was having fun with his “Bunny”!  Save it with sticks &amp; stones “hypocrite”!!!
Everybody wanted to be where Trump was! If you were lucky enough to be invited to the same party as the Trumps, then you were considered to have made with the elite crowd! But then they found out what a sick, dirty sex addict Epstein was &amp; most respectable people backed away!
Oh we ALL get the Trump thing now... and it’s all BULL...
Trump just lost my vote with low housing not allowed in suburbs!!
ALL America does NOT love President tRUMP! Don’t pretend to speak for me; I do not love him. I don’t even like him. However, hate is a strong word &amp; it usually means you wish ill will on a person. I do not hate him or wish him harm.
Also videos showed tRUMP partied at Epstein’s &amp; a you didn’t pre-pubescent teen accused him of rape!
PULEEZE! I guarantee he’ll debate tRUMP &amp; you’ll be able to understand what he’s saying! When Joe Biden states facts, they are true facts, not lies like tRUMP spouts!
So with Trump deciding to put out an executive order I'm backing up all my stuff to Likee and installing a VPN  Fuck me I guess
Then don’t support Joe Biden because he is! Trump is not!
I really don’t know where you people come up with these outlandish statements. Trump loves America &amp; is helping us keep our freedoms. You should back him with pride in your heart. He’s the only thing standing between us and a Socialist/Communist take over! He deserves our thanks!
thinks he’s above our laws.  Dump Trump!
When ⁦ attempts to distract us  by showing us more of his stupidity.  And our economy!!!  Trying to make the USA his 7th bankruptcy!  Need I say more? Dump Trump!

Looking back at this list it is clear that money brings nothing but trouble. Each achievement by Obama could cost nothing to achieve. tRump spends more covering up his messes including alimony and child support than Obama has made in his life after the accolades he has had.
One of the major reasons Trump is building the wall! Human trafficking!
Haha the fact that John Lewis was a Civil Rights leader for over 60 years makes it a political funeral. Are you kidding me, he was chosen to speak the eulogy because they knew it would be words on inspiration. When tRump learns some he can use them any way he chooses!
Trump has been to that island plenty. They were bff’s and they didn’t hide it. Amazing what you see only what you want to see. Of course his name is being kept out. He’s the fucking sitting and I mean sitting president. If Prince Andrew were King his name would be missing too.

Trump never went to Epstein’s  Island. Can’t you read? He banned him from his properties because he &amp; his pimp made advances on one of Trumps young employees. Then he went to the Palm Beach Sheriffs office &amp; filed a complaint against Epstein!
President Donald Trump on Friday told reporters he will act as soon as Saturday to ban Chinese-owned video app #TikTok from the United States.
Wow! I read the names in that list &amp; some were pretty shocking! No Trump though! I mean really. Like that would interest him in the least!
Hey! Epstein was the opportunist that loved to mingle with the elite! He bought his way into those groups. Trump reported him to the Palm Beach Sheriffs Dept. &amp; banned him from all of his clubs!
In the three major investigation into everything Trump so far, don’t you think this would have been revealed if there were any truth to it?
If it wasn't Biden i vote for a chiquita banana just so that lunatic  dissapears. What's he and Putin hiding? And what's so secret in his money numbers that he refuses to share with America? This country is so great others countries are laughing and close their borders

There’s no such thing as “Democrat Ballot Harvesting”. You’re just doing the same shady shit as Trump.
I doubt it. Not from Trump anyway. Local govt, wouldn't surprise me though. I will refuse no matter what. He knows that we will refuseGiven the fact that we now have incontrovertible proof that mask mandates dramatically lower infection rates compared to neighboring counties with no mask mandates, the time has come for Trump to saddle up and issue a national mask mandate.  Should have been done months ago.
Pretty sure he has. Trump dosnt own alot of those properties he leases out his name. I think he only owns NY and FL. If he’s breaking the law though I’m sure the left will bring it up. But the fact that they haven’t leads me to believe he’s not. I don’t know Trumps finances.
Haters are all ways gonna hate, cause than can. President Trump is a winner &amp; haters hate winners.
I think this is your best one yet. Mostly the pic w/ President Trump going against the globe ( world ) in a chess match.
They wanted Trump to declare martial law to use against him. I’m glad he didn’t fall for their trap. Just like democrats created draft because they where against war not because they thought it was right thing for the country. The left will watch America burn if it means they win
You’re the reason Trump is in office 🤣
Why not try the british way and just ignore these trump TV show events.
But I’ll take higher debt and keep my guns and religion and not murder babies so Biden who claims to be catholic (a religion that notorious for pedaphiles and gangsters) and  is pro choice so yah I can see where Trump might make that assumption
When was any politician against debt. Regan rebuilt military after Vietnam Bush fought 2 wars and Trump has to rebuild military after 8 years of neglect and now covid. When would you like to cut spending? I’m all for it.
I WONDER HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR SOMEONE TO TELL   AND HIS FOLLOWERS THAT THAT  Executive order exist already under Obamacare 😳😳 TRUMP  FOLLOWERS  SWEAR  THEY  SMART  AND  INVENTED  THE  WHEEL  🙃🙃
I defend Trump because what you are saying is untrue. If you made a legit point I would agree. the swamp wants business as usual politicians get rich while in office and keep sheep’s at bay while protecting pediphiles in high places. Trump goes against that so they hate him
You don’t understand is Trump is a man. I vote for the GOP ideology and he is the head of it. I vote for individual liberty. 2nd amendment pro life pro freedom of religion pro business less hand outs. That’s what I support no matter who’s on the ticket.
That’s the vibe I get from her. I’m libertarian &amp; cant stand Trump. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Joe Biden attacks Donald Trump for 'shameful' claim he is 'against God'
Oh but he has blocked 11,000 people since the pandemic 😂😂. He is definitely a fraud, and was never a trump supporter. He is a narcissistic opportunist, grifter. I’m glad people see his true colors.
Mick Jagger knows what Stones song he'd play at a political rally. But Trump should ask first
Trump's Tweet is about the Local aid part, not the stimulus checks.
Trump government has given hundreds and hundreds of billions to large corporations and smaller businesses in PPP to keep people employed. But nothing for local and state government to keep police, nurses, EMTs, teachers employed. Instead they claim it's a bailout. BS. #Trumpdemic
But there isn't going to be a wealth tax under Trump &amp; once he's gone, these kind of people won't be making deals of the same ilk. I'm not against a wealth tax, but it ain't getting rid of these people until we get rid of Trump.
Joe Biden is racist AGAIN but Chris Cuomo blames TRUMP for being mentall...

How can President Donald Trump not get re elected. Stand strong fellow proud Americans. This leftist Cyst infecting our great land is about to be removed.
you both have destroyed NYC! I used to love going there now you have homeless in hotels you let criminals out of prison, putting covid patients in nursing homes and you graffiti in front of Trump hotels.  maybe you can fix NY they failed
....And ONLY if Trump doesn't suggest it.
Orange man bad! All you know. Good luck. I notice you weren’t mad when beloved Obama sold weapons to drug cartels that where used on border patrol agents. And that’s hard proof. But a rumor and hearsay is enough for you to condem Trump. Keep believing narrative they feed you.
Democrats Are BURNING Cities To The Ground, NYC Is Crumbling As Homeless...  via  I will not be staying in nyc till  is out of office and the BLM graffiti is removed from in front of Trump towers
That’s why he uses nice words with NK. If honey gets them to the table to talk why use vinegar. How does that help. Notice NK hasn’t fired rockets in a while. They just want acknowledgment as respect. Trump gave them that and it costs nothing and in return we have a safer planet
Just like I don’t believe Joe meant any disrespect to blacks with his comments. And was allowed to explain. Trump explained that comment saying not the virus but the lefts fear monger reaction is the hoax. And with a death rate of .001 yah we didn’t need to kill our economy
Also im pretty sure none of the Trump supporters would say any of those things that are in Mandarin....
In reality Obama could have run for President again, the only limit is 2 consecutive terms that means he can run again for a 3rd term because Trump term broke up the consecutive.
Better yet the Dems have no idea what President Trump's plan is or if they do they know their in deep s#?t &amp; can't stop him.
This morning my 4-year old granddaughter told me Trump is the worst president ever.
Gee it's a good thing our electoral system is so great and awesome that idiots like this can try to interfere by just running a lame ass campaign. This is exactly why the Republicans are helping him
I wouldn’t worry you could say and do anything because no matter what your voters will always hate Trump more..... I just hope Kanye doesn’t drop out.

You’re right he was the problem 🙄 He reflected how most of us feel and called him out for nonsensical claims. Trump is the president of the United States and he acts like a fool, liar, coward, race-baiting douchebag on a daily basis. What do you want?
I have kids who's future is my primary interest in voting, and another 4 years of Trump is a far worse proposition than 4 or less of Biden. Minority groups, especially minority families have too much at stake to blow these things off because a candidate isn't ideal
Trump watches TV, rage tweets,  plays golf, and rants at reporters. Yeah, poor guy needs a vacation.
The order said that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and could hand over personal information about users to the Chinese government.
Exactly. Trump is toast after his "exhausting" propaganda tour yesterday.
So I've been seeing arguments back and forth regarding the Republicans against Trump, Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, Bill Kristol, etc. Welcome the help.
None of these Trump appointed people are on the sides of the Americans. Foreign governments have compromised these people. Why else would they be doing all of these dastardly deeds?!
Oh and would you accept that explanation if Trump said it right after saying if you don’t vote for me then you ain’t black? That’s all black people need, a white guy telling them how they’re misinterpreting racism. Well played.
All you said is totally true. President Trump is the only man who can save our nation.

Cool options to offer up- they are both dead, as far as I know, so unfortunately off the table. Oddly enough, no one alive- outside of Trump, his base, dictators, and murderers- are advocating for measures that are being advocated for in our country that will get people killed.
Any vote other than Biden is dooming our country- you said it yourself. It literally DOES NOT MATTER who his VP pick is (unless it's Kayne)- anyone, literally anyone, would be better than Trump if it came to their leadership of the country.
Nope-THIS ☝️is the last person that   should highlight- this crazy person was never a trump supporter-dont get me wrong, he tried to play it to get supporters, and actually conned quite a few people-but in reality, he is mentally unstable

Trump is the alleged mob Boss who was gonna use the Presidency to make billions, yet the only real evidence right now is Joe and Hunter using their power for profit while Trump is constantly (illegally) under investigation and they’ve still got nothing. I get you don’t like him
You think Obama and Biden did a better job running the country than Trump? You REALLY believe that? I’m not asking which PERSONALITY you liked more or who fit the part better. I’m saying JUST based on policy and results. You really think Obama was a better President?
I don’t think either candidates are sane to be honest. Trump hasn’t lived in reality ever, but Biden is literally in cognitive decline. I choose the one who actually has a choice when it comes to deciding what sanity actually is. Biden doesn’t know anymore.
President Trump was not at the club, which is currently closed.
Oh that I agree with which is sad. Trump is a shit bag human being, BUT he’s NOT a bad President. Biden isn’t capable of speaking a sentence with full confidence but he’s supposed to run the country? What’s better a bad personality who is obsessed with succeeding or a half corpse
This is a horrible stat for humanity, but believe it or not, it's also horrible for Trump. VOTE!
Most Trump ‘muricans confuse communism and socialism regularly 🤷🏼‍♂️.  Most also don’t realize the US has socialist programs already
In my opinion, support for Trump's pandemic response or attempts to dismiss the seriousness is no different than stating support for the death and suffering of others. Such offenders will not have me wasting any more time appealing to a humanity within them that doesn't exist.
If you honestly hate Trump for asking campaign advice or think it’s somehow evil, how do you explain Hunter Biden doing a $1.5 B dollar transaction with them and flying there and back on a plane that operates solely on tax dollars?

Yes, I'd agree Trump has done more for the American people in the last 3 and a half years than Biden, Pelosi  and Obama has in their whole political lives.
People power beats the establishment machine. To beat Trump, Democrats need to reject corporate money and take a moral stand for America’s working class. It’s time to get on board with the generational change sweeping progressives like  and  into Congress.
Trump has way more accomplishments and has done way more good for the American people than Biden has in his 49 years in our Government.

Which is better ? Only two people got viruses but they both died or 1000 people got it and only two died. That’s what Trump was saying. You have a better chance of getting it but you also have a better chance of living if you get it. Why can’t they give him that credit?
I got where Trump was going. If you get virus in America and by reporters story you have a greater chance of catching it here, Trump,  if you catch it you have a better chance of living in America. Deaths per case not death per population. If I get it will I survive? Yes.

Why does AP use a headline like that? Trump isn't "giving" anything.
He’s a narcissist who pretended to support Trump in order to get followers, who he then in turn conned many into giving him $ so he could travel to promote Trump (trips that never happened) He also conned some to give him gifts (like a $1,000 bike that he turned around and sold)
Analysis: Trump's a dumb fuck and we all know it.
“It is what it is.” That’s the sentiment Mr. Trump feels for the pain that you feel, or your family, your friends, members of your community, who are facing suffering and death due to Covid-19.  The grief of losing 1,000 a day gets what amounts to a shoulder shrug.
Trump is clearly insane.

Hate to tell you pal but you're not that important
I wasn’t aware living free was an option with all the dying going on a around me. Thank you Das Trump for allowing our families the opportunity to die in your honor!!!! ☺️What Trump nut.  We already allow to watch television.
My 2 republican uncles and aunt who are tired of Trump told me last week that they would vote for Biden if he picked harris. Would write in someone else if he picked rice. They think rice is hillary part 2 and  that she lied about benghazi...Shes too hawkish. ..
Me Trump does not deserve respect.  He is a corrupt &amp; ignorant liar, incompetent at his job and unconcerned with the lives, health &amp; well-being of the citizens.  None of you like him.  You like what the GOP gets away with because of him.
People who believe him and vote for him are the idiots.  Trump is an ignorant corrupt liar &amp; conman.  He is doing as he is told by his political “donors”.  We’ll call them donors.  He hasn’t had an independent idea in decades, if ever.

Nah.. trump will chew her and spit her out... remember he goaded her to take A DNA test and she wasn't even running against him.
Don’t get me wrong I do not support trump at all, but I’m not gonna support a man that questions my blackness based on if I vote for him
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that

You may have a hard time. Although the Amish are religiously conservative they put a LOT of stock on morality. I know a few Amish and they see Trump as "fake religious" which is an afront to them. They lean towards conservative ideals but Trump turns a lot of them off.

Who is "he?" President Trump has said more than once that republicans would come up with a plan. In my opinion, they haven't come up with a great one, but it doesn't matter since democrats won't even entertain the idea of supporting anything done by republicans.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:
Biden is no better than Trump.

An appropriate critique of ‘The Left’ is the unwilling nature to acknowledge any failures of democrats. Neoliberal Market Based ideology of the human condition is quite common. Trump derangement syndrome is a comfortable consequence for most. When we accept that, we can move on.

The democrats in congress have always said "oh, Trump wants to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions." The President NEVER said that, in fact has said multiple times that he wanted to KEEP pre-existing coverage. Now he's proven it at least, even if it's not needed yet.
Then you were awaiting a happy outcome.  Now, not so sure.  And even with our happy Trump defeat outcome we will still have lost hundreds of thousand of cherished lives.  Such sadness.

Keep telling yourself that. People still have not gotten used to getting screwed on their coverage + rates. Do we really have to have this debate again? Although President Trump taking away the mandate DID help. But it also made it more financially unsustainable.

No, the ACA already did exactly what this EO is saying. What Trump is doing here is making it look like he’s introducing something new to take credit for something that already exists.
This is insane - panicked Republicans saying Trump needs to attack Biden; they got here by doing nothing to help people, just attacking people. Their endless attacks are the problem.

Trump might win in Nov. if he puts it on. Pigs will fly. Hell he wants us to do what hes not even willing to do himself, not even once, not even for show. Dont take the job if you dont want to lead. Honestly we would be back to work like he wanted if he could turn the ego down.
The security risk is Trump. China came up with two popular APS.  America stop crying foul and just compete.

GOT AND GET IT!!! TRUMP IS THE AMERICAN GOAT!!!
can’t fathom that there are individuals who are AWARE of  trump’s racist past, present and foreseeable future &amp; STILL plan to vote for him for the “economy” and “his leadership.”  #VoteOutRacism
One has to wonder if you are stalling on purpose so Trump can come in and look like the hero.
Trump is a racist and more old school. He panders to “voting blocs” with falsehoods and has abandoned American values. He doesn’t question but just supports a White Supremacist Agenda. Correct, Ali?
Russia is helping Trump.  Trump is assaulting China because they said no.
I like when everyone except Trump talks with their hands because his hand movements are so pointless it enrages me 🤣
Link a video where President Trump is "whining like a belligerent little child throwing temper tantrums." I wasn't able to come up with one, but I'm sure based on your post that you'll have better luck than me. I mean, you didn't just pull that out of your ass, did you?
Ok, so HC has only been disproven by every dr BUT one you dug up. Tested in hospitals they found patients using it got sicker, died sooner, no one improved. And yes, Trump most definitely DID recommend it &amp; was spokesperson saying HE uses it. Gonna tell me disinfectant works too?

You acknowledged it though... very Trump-sequel. He invested money in it, yeah?  “Mouth-breathers” or not, people find them stylish—whereas electric cars were notoriously unsexy.

Who is "he?" President Trump has said more than once that republicans would come up with a plan. In my opinion, they haven't come up with a great one, but it doesn't matter since democrats won't even entertain the idea of supporting anything done by republicans.

I'll save you the trouble of reading the article (I'm sure you would have): “Long to me would be weeks,” Trump said. “It won’t be repeal and then two years later go in with another plan,” he said, referring to proposals by some Republicans to “repeal-and-delay.”
The only reason obamacare hasn't been consigned to the trash heap of history is because dems won't do anything about it because anything Trump is for, they are against, and Republicans have never had a super majority during Trump's presidency.
obamacare is only a law because dems had a super majority for two years of obama's presidency. They wasted their time by ramming through something that even obama said needed work to be sustainable.  This would seem to fly in the face of what you said:
Biden is no better than Trump.

An appropriate critique of ‘The Left’ is the unwilling nature to acknowledge any failures of democrats. Neoliberal Market Based ideology of the human condition is quite common. Trump derangement syndrome is a comfortable consequence for most. When we accept that, we can move on.
To be fair, Trump is the worst president at everything.
Ummm, he technically did spit on a child’s face, along with assaulted the child by grabbing his hand, taking his mask off and then continued to assault an employee who tried to stop him! 🙄 Guy was drunk off his rocker with no shoes on. Go figure he’s a Trump supporter. 🦇💩🤪

Keep telling yourself that. People still have not gotten used to getting screwed on their coverage + rates. Do we really have to have this debate again? Although President Trump taking away the mandate DID help. But it also made it more financially unsustainable.
Imagine if, due to their absolute allergy to popular and sensible policy, Trump end-runs the Dems on this and healthcare in the next few months by announcing a bunch of good new giveaways. GOP would probably finance it if it gurantees them permanent SCOTUS maj, which it would
The man has lost his mind.  Why hasn't anyone invoked the 25th Amendment?  Trump is unfit to be President.  We all know it's going to be a sh*t show come Nov. 3rd.
No, the ACA already did exactly what this EO is saying. What Trump is doing here is making it look like he’s introducing something new to take credit for something that already exists.Given the fact that we now have incontrovertible proof that mask mandates dramatically lower infection rates compared to neighboring counties with no mask mandates, the time has come for Trump to saddle up and issue a national mask mandate.  Should have been done months ago.

Yes, I'd agree Trump has done more for the American people in the last 3 and a half years than Biden, Pelosi  and Obama has in their whole political lives.
People power beats the establishment machine. To beat Trump, Democrats need to reject corporate money and take a moral stand for America’s working class. It’s time to get on board with the generational change sweeping progressives like  and  into Congress.
Trump has way more accomplishments and has done way more good for the American people than Biden has in his 49 years in our Government.

Sorry you so mad but these people work day and night fighting for abused molested sold and murdered children! Its not about Trump dummy. They support him but its not a "veiled campaign!" Obviously you dont care if people are fighting for our kids or not. They get shit done!!
Thank you for conducting such a powerful and powerfully revealing interview with Trump. Easily one of the best I've seen. You did a great job, and didn't give an inch. Thank you again.
I'm very sure that is the case... welcome to Trump-ocolypse.

Why does AP use a headline like that? Trump isn't "giving" anything.
“It is what it is.” That’s the sentiment Mr. Trump feels for the pain that you feel, or your family, your friends, members of your community, who are facing suffering and death due to Covid-19.  The grief of losing 1,000 a day gets what amounts to a shoulder shrug.
I am sure the Trump Campaign is wargaming this election as well and could have specific plot twists, but take this one at face value for sensationalism by the NY Times and also take this one with a raised eyebrow as to the notion that people DO think this way.
It’s frustrating that the only time it happened in 2016 was Chris Matthews doing the same thing and making Trump accidentally spill how he wanted to jail women and doctors for abortion.
Trump is clearly insane.

It’s time to remind Trump that We Will Vote. Donald Trump is trying to delay our elections. He knows he’s failed the American people and doesn’t want to be held accountable.
Yes! It hadn’t really occurred to me to be extra careful, owing to the seriousness of this election and potential risk of even more fraud and deceit from trump and mcconnell’s sycophants. I never gave these guys the respect of capitalizing their names. It’s petty but feels right!

Microsoft to pursue talks to buy TikTok in the US after consulting Trump? Yet, Trump is considering a #ban on TikTok in US?  Hmm....sounds like underhanded dealings to take place.
Think he’s saying to be careful though of someone of Trump’s character coming to power and using a monarch to run for cover ... remember at this time we as Americans fought for our freedom from a monarch ... a king who was merciless
Full disclosure: I'm not a Christian, though I was raised to be evangelical Christian- I'm an atheist; however I do think Trump is the ant-Christ, and it has occurred to me that a rapture-like event may happen. As in, his support disappears.

You're going to blame President Trump for software that's a major security threat to the United States? I'm sorry you lost your niece, but there's never a guarantee when it comes to technology. Look for a technical solution to capture those videos if you put effort into it.
You have to agree for facebook to do that and when the last time they fucked up their security they paid billions. the issue with tiktok (which other countries banned before trump did) is that is steals your private information without asking to do so.
not like anything you're saying makes "it look you did something" but u keep sucking off the spywares tit and go "orange man baaaaaaad" other countries already did what trump is trying to do. so its not "he mad" its "the app is borderline spyware and a threat to national security
lmao pot calling the kettle black aren't you. assuming its being banned "because they made trump mad" makes no sense. so why did you "say sum that doesn't make sense rather than saying nothing at all"
Trump 👇🏾👎🏾
gen z and tiktok is trending because is gonna be banned in the us and going "trump baaaaaaaaaad" but its been banned in other countries for being a threat to national security

And then, of course, there is the inhospitable way trump treats immigrants both legal and illegal and the poor. Just politics you might say? I would answer that Biden’s stance on abortion is also just politics .
Moreover, Biden neither renounced nor denounced his faith with his political position. One could well argue that Trump’s lack of love, compassion, mercy, humility and grace most assuredly is against the teachings of Jesus and the will of God.
And ppl call Trump a racist, open your eyes listen to anything that comes out of fucking Joe's mouth and that he has been saying for the last 49 years he's been in government. #trump2020

Herman Cain attended the June 20 Tulsa Rally where no one was required to wear masks. He was diagnosed June 29. Hospitalized July 2. Now dead. No one should blame trump for this plague . But the death of Cain, and others at that rally, create a blood trail straight to trump.

Do you think Biden and Trump have literally identical policies?
She should have gone the Machiavellian route. Just tell the truth; I want to be President and the route there means I have to be VP first, if Biden wins. Everyone knows it and if she just admitted to it she would look like Frank Underwood going for the Presidency.
True, but people generally believe what Trump is doing or saying, that he means it; where as Biden comes off as disorientated and not able to follow what is happening around him. It also does not help that Biden's staff started restricting Biden answering reporters at briefs.
I am a Democrat, but don't see how Biden can win. There are signs that he is in 'mental decline' and simply not up to running a campaign. One poll shows 38% believe this to be true; which shows how poorly the campaign has been run if people really think that.
Biden will take questions during the debates. No need to have press conferences now because that’s what republiCONS want, so they can talk about Biden instead of the clusterf🤡🤡k Trump administration. We’re not playing these games, Greta!
There is an argument for Biden not wanting to add ANYTHING new to his platform so Republicans have nothing new to attack.
The DNC this year is basically a celebration of the Democratic Party’s defeat of the left and not even really affirmatively in favor of Biden. It’s a complete joke and it shows what their priorities are so clearly.

What election? Who’s the democrat candidate??? Seriously! Does it look like there’s going to be an election. The most important election in history, and Biden is their candidate!😂😂Wake up, see the light!
Birtherism already won. Biden reportedly took Duckworth off the VP short list because silly questions about overseas birth (her father was a US citizen) would be distracting. This is how conformity is enforced at both extremes. Resistance isn't futile. It's just exhausting.

Do these people in this thread think Biden and Trump are literally exactly the same? That both would be equally harmful as president in the next four years?  You don’t get to call yourself anti-fascist if you won’t vote out fascism.

Never happen  vote BIDEN and Harris
WTF is it? The heat down there?... Nevermind did a standout for Biden Harris yesterday here in Massachusetts while Trumpers had a rally across the street. Got screamed at that we were supporting pedophilia. Strange times...
I dunno... In time to bend the knee to Biden and co..which was a deal breaker to me.  Just giving credit where due.. she held out longer than the rest, didn't drop out when everyone else did in the Super Tuesday Bernie takedown.
Biden wants a sniff
Also, just love this Holbrooke anecdote that  dug up. On Afghanistan, at least, Biden’s instincts in office were not unlike Trump’s.
To me, it pairs nicely with this  piece on how the Obama entourage often dismissed Biden's instincts as an old-school retail politician. For better or worse, that's who he is.

He didn't "attack" Biden.
Bad job by  covering the presidents campaign speech .  He spews half truths and attacks his opponents. This is not a press conference. Give equal time to VP Biden!!
Our best path forward is get Biden into the Whitehouse, and then call out EVERYTHING and explain how to fix it. When the people observe how Biden in fact does not have the answer, we need to be there with solutions. This is how we win!
I agree with Vaush.  People see the problems now, but they will never learn that Biden won’t fix them unless Biden is elected and they see for themselves that he isn’t fixing them. If Trump wins, they will keep blaming it all on Trump without looking deeper.

When you move in January is there any chance you could leave a few pens behind so that President Biden can sign some Exexutive Orders before the Innaugural Balls begin. It would be very helpful. All the best.

Joe Biden is not entitled to your vote
You are absolutely right, we must become ungovernable and dismantle the govt. however, we must manufacture conditions that allow us to achieve that purpose. I guess some of us believe the Biden/Harris ticket would be advantageous in that pursuit

Peak Kamala was when she came at Biden during the debates that one time.
The only positive to a Biden presidency is that a lot of centrists don’t care about policy they just want to not pay attention to politics. And when they see Biden being president doesn’t stop that they’ll have a choice republican authoritarianism or progressive ideals

My God, Carr. This is THE bottom of the barrel of Op-Ed pieces...even for you. You can't fault Harris...although giving it the old college try...so you have to once again slam Warren and Biden (complete with tired old nicknames) to appease your base? Are you that out of gas?
Biden and Harris are politicians which by definition means they have issues.  Those issues do not include putting children into cages and then “losing them,” calling Nazis “very fine people,” and selling the lives of troops to Russia.  There is no third choice.  #BidenHarris2020
Im saying I have to see what Biden and Harris offer. If the only difference between trump and Biden admins is that one tweets awful things while the other doesnt. And if people still die wo healthcare &amp; the rich get richer under both admins what substantive difference is there?
Her history of attacking Biden does not make Kamala a hypocrite for accepting the VP spot. If you want to make a difference and do good, you will accept legitimately substantive roles working for people you believe made mistakes or disagree with.
Don’t forget about the entire Biden family. Including low life drug addict Hunter.

The Democrats overlook that Hunter Biden will be a big issue that Trump will go after hard. At worst, there is a some really shady stuff going on. At best, he has pretty heavy financial ties to China. I mean he was “gifted” a 3ct diamond by the head of a Chinese conglomerate
Not gonna lie .. if people vote for Biden OR Trump, I WILL blame them...for enabling a broken system that's gonna get us all fuckin' dead.
Oh btw. How many pictures of biden have Epstein in them huh?   So what are you gonna do. Shift to obama?  Or just the standard trumpanzees response of duuuuuh democrat
Well hes certainly not the one who has 25 sexual misconduct allegations against him.  And biden sure as hell didnt call epstein a "terrific guy"
These are the same dipshits who refer to Biden, HRC and Harris as "Radical Leftists"  Clearly their judgement on political labeling is suspect at best 🤣
She has an in with Biden’s doctor. She knows that she won’t have to hold her nose long!
Biden is not perfect. He is also not Tr*mp.  Harris is not perfect. She is also not Pence.  Lives are at stake and we’ve got work to do.   Don’t want to do the work for Biden and Harris? Cool. Pick a Senate race.  Let’s focus, people.
Is Kamala Harris actually pro-Israel? Despite me losing my mind about her being our next VP, I guess that would at least mean that the Biden administration would be good for Israel (compared to our other options in the Democratic Party, at least).
Tulsi Gabbard would have been a far superior choice for Joe Biden over Kamala Harris. Doesn't really matter, they are going to lose so badly anyway.
Tbt to Kamala Harris joking about doing drugs in college, yet ruined people’s lives for doing drugs... also called joe biden a racist but yeah new VP for him lmaoooo Christ
Trump using Kamala's attacks on Biden against her is hilarious as he's literally calling him "sleepy Joe" in the same sentence and saying Biden wants to dismantle religion, destroy the suburbs, eliminate the police, destroy healthcare and let China own the United States.
If only John Lewis  could witness this  how proud he would be  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  LET’S DO THIS
I also thought on this more and would like to say (because I didn’t explicitly say) that Biden is also not a shining choice (imo). In all I think Kamala is a better candidate and person.
Hey Moscow, we are getting our own relief on November 3rd. Biden/Harris, the Senate and a greater majority in the House....it’s over Turtle Head. It’s over.
No, but if you can make Joe Biden and Donald Trump disappear... I'll sign right on up! 😂
I'm voting for them not because Bernie supports them, but because Trump is the worst. Biden-Harris is the most boring, vanilla ticket we've had since I can remember.
If and When Biden has to step aside...how is anyone allowing this man to run for President?! It's insane and so damn sad

Why New Gun Owners Should Fear A Joe Biden Presidency -
Sorry to be blunt, Bishop, but you couldn't be more incredibly wrong. Both VP Biden and Dr. Jill Biden are devout Roman Catholics and life-long church-goers. And not that I care what religion any politician is, just that it needs to be out of government, way out.
I just unfriended and blocked an alt-leftist who admitted he'd rather have four more years of Trump than Biden / Harris. This is not progressive. It's psychotic.
I understand we will never get the perfect ticket. And trust me, I will still vote Biden/Harris because folx lives depend on it. But *sigh* I just wanted something more radical and progressive.
Harris also stated she believed Tara Reade’s acusation that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993.
And as someone very astutely pointed out on the thread, how is it that the Obama/Biden ticket but not the Biden/Harris ticket has a Catholic on it?
87% or sanders voters voted clinton and it’s still our fault she lost, why would vote for a worse candidate. You wanted to win with republicans go win over republicans. I voted for Clinton. Won’t be voting for Biden
I’m not sure which I’m looking forward to more: Biden vs. Trump, Kamala vs. Pence, or the  cold opens.
I was voting Biden anyway.
True. Was a terrible policy widespread in this country that has decimated communities of color for more than a generation. I think she gets that now, but no doubt that Biden and Harris both have responsibility for the impact.
EXACTLY!!!!!   Hopefully biden/harris can rebuild the bridges trump burned.  I think they can, given i know people from other regions of the world.  Most do know trumps the asshole not Americans.  Ive seen iranian interviews that they just blame trump/government
Kamala has also called Biden a Racist.   Why would she join the ticket of a man she called a racist and said she believed the accusations that he sexually assaulted Tara Reade?
Whew .. I was fearing Susan Rice. Kamala is a total disaster and this ensures Biden will lose badly.  Not a drop of slave blood in her!  Descended from Indians and slave trading Jamaicans.
the “history” being made isn’t worth the damage her &amp; biden will cause
Breaking news: For his VP pick Joe Biden went to the depths of Uganda and found himself a giant 😂😂 #RIPKamala
Biden and Harris have a heart and a soul. Trump and Pence have ice water running through their veins, and no semblance of a soul.
I agree with the first sentence and I'll go as far as to say it's about as good as I could expect from Biden. I was really hoping for a progressive (thinking they might sell it as circling of the party wagon thing), but at the end of the day, this sphere's gonna burn regardless
Kamala explain the face that “you” called Biden a Racist and “you” said you believed Biden’s accusers; on the sexual assault accusation!   Care to explain your change of heart?  Or why you sold out; for ANOTHER job opportunity?
Kamala recently called Biden a racist and said she believed Biden’s accusers on the sexual assault.  A great pick 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The people have the right to choose another option then state run healthcare and I do not like Biden's gun agenda at all.
Biden and Kamala is definitely a BK that I’ll have my way! Here’s to a whopper of a victory!
It does matter though. If you don't vote for Biden, you're effectively voting for Trump.
Uhm....hello!!! China virus? Kung fu virus?  He literally blamed covid on them. Claims china was in cahoots with biden to ruin trumps campaign?  How about this?
I am so proud of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We are lucky to have these two, who will bring back decency, honor, ethics,respectability, knowledge, intelligence, truthfulness, equality &amp; class back to the White House. In the age of Trump, these two are like a breath of fresh air.
that’s what gets me thinkin ya know. like I’ve BEEN super critical of her for a while, but I can’t get over the fact that I don’t think she would be this scrutinized for being chosen as Biden’s VP if she wasn’t a WOC

If you are acting happy that Kamala was picked to be Biden’s running mate, I can only assume you either don’t know about her record as a Cali DA, or you’re pretending this is good because it’s too late to change Biden’s pick and Trump scares you that much. Look into Jo Jorgensen.
someone pull my tweet from 2 years ago that said the only way Biden wins is if Kamala Harris is his running mate
Biden/Harris is the Police State ticket. And Trump sucks too. But there is a better choice.   wants to end policemen’s qualifies immunity BS, release non-violent offenders from prison, and fix the broken expensive healthcare system.  #LetHerSpeak #VoteGold
Biden, the guy who wrote the crime bill that gave police the power to act without consequence &amp; ramp up the incarceration rate of black Americans, picked Kamala, the prosecutor who locked up thousands for weed possession and blocked DNA evidence in a death penalty case, for VP.
Joe Biden. Forward ever
Agree. This is utter bullshit. Even if I liked Susan rice. I am glad that Biden picked who he liked.
No i knew. But its hard to tell one idiot trumper from another since you all sound the same.   No facts, just slander. Duuuuuuh democrat.  Duuuuuhhhhh biden. Deeeeerp obama.  Youre all clones.   And youre all obsessed with democrats because theyre successful and trumpers fail

Joe Biden is not sitting down with Tom Perez going thru invites like they are planning a wedding. Most likely this is done by committee and Biden may not even be asked about it.
Rice will bring up Benghazi all over again  BIDEN/HARRIS 2020

Oooobaaaaama!  Biden! Democrat  Oooooooh trumper slurs.  Whatcha gonna do little man!  #biden2020 #TrumpIsLosing
Look, I don't want to deal in absolutes here... but if you seriously believe that HRC, Obama or Joe Biden are "Radical Leftists", there's no polite way to say it: You're a complete blithering idiot and no one should take anything you say seriously - on any matter - henceforth.
Oh, can't forget this whopper: HRC, Obama and Biden are "radical Leftists"  🤣😂😆😂🤣🤣
Joe Biden selects his running mate with announcement coming as early as Tuesday
I'm not censuring anyone for endorsing Biden. The voters picked him based on the current election system on the books and we need to get Trump out. Yang and Bernie can't throw the establishment under the bus and expect to change hearts and minds for next time.
1) R's cut M's from security funding to embassies! 2) 163k + &amp; counting! 3) Biden/Rice, they've worked together for 8+ years! She doesn't take shit, one bad ass, she will help mend our foreign allies!
Is that what Biden is speaking?
Given the democratic push for something like universal basic income over the course of the pandemic, I'm surprised Yang wasn't invited...unless of course Biden wants to steer clear of that UBI.
No, I agree. But they are still popular Democratic politicians who are considered up-and-comers in the Democratic party and aren't "not being accepted" by the DNC. The DNC Convention is not just about "ideas", especially ideas that Biden isn't currently supporting.
Exactly. And for what? He fell in line with Biden, and now he's being left on the side-line. He should have stuck to his principles and chosen the candidate that better aligned with him, not the most likely to win.
No no. Nothing is ending. The DNC isn't a TV ratings juggernaut. There will be other opportunities. Most likely Yang is going to be in Biden's cabinet or running for NYC mayor in early 2021. Yang is a lot to keep the movement going. We are still full speed ahead.
BREAKING NEWS: Joe Biden has picked ____________ as his VP!  / topic by  #pitchjokes
Literally there have been multiple articles rejecting Harris(who I hate)..etc as Biden’s VP because she is “too ambitious” or has “too much vision”..... so you nominate the guy Obama must have felt “had no ambition” or “ no real vision” as F***ING PRESIDENT? Speaks volumes
Biden? There have been multiple parties that have said his conduct among woman was an issue.
First of all Biden was Tara’s employer....he was also marrried.

This is what a president says and does. Thank you Joe Biden. We need you more than ever!
There is also a very serious threat that Biden/Rice will continue the hawkish attitude towards Iran. It’s been well documented that Biden was/is against Obama and Kerry’s Iran Deal, and with Rice in the VP slot, it seems all the more likely that we will not go back to the deal.
undermine the Maduro Government. I understand people’s wish to remove Trump at all costs, but this is an incredibly serious issue and, between Trump and Biden, it’s basically a wash. There really isn’t much separating them.
To be clear, the strategy of regime change in Venezuela was well under way under Obama. Pelosi and other leading Democrats welcomed the rise of Juan Guaido with open arms. The Biden/Rice admin will undoubtedly continue a hawkish attitude towards Venezuela and will continue to....
Biden is likely to pick Susan Rice as VP. The reasoning for this is pretty clear: he wants to return to the neoliberal globalist status quo of US empire and reestablish the US as the world’s sole super power. This is catastrophic for the situation in South America and MENA.
Joe Biden tried to defund Social Security several times over his career.
Fake news by Biden what else is new
Takes great skill. You should totally grade your president on if he can ride a bike or not. The bar for Biden is that low anything he does that he Dosent completly botch and gaffe all over you try and use it as a strength
If you don’t laugh out loud when you hear twerpy Don Jr. criticize Hunter Biden you are so special stupid that you’re probably still paying off your Sears credit card.
Trump was for gay marriage before Biden and  Obama but ok facts don’t matter
Biden tweeted that very thing today.
And you know that Obama or whoever he is will be the actual President should Biden win. That'll be end of whatever remains of America.
Dead-in-the-head biden “peaceful protestor” voters
And, I might add, I hope when President Biden is in the WH and Dems control both houses of Congress, which WE WILL, that repealing the PAEA will be on their massive to-do list.
Keep your focus away from Kanye my sisters and brothers of color.  We bop to Kanye's music, but we can't allow him to hurt the election like he's attempting to do.  He's admitting to what I knew he was trying to do, and it's wrong.
Biden losing with Buttigieg as the VP would be the funniest to me
Easy with all the Biden funny money they've scammed. Hard to believe this crook has the nomination. Apparently normal in that party, tho.
Just temp. if Biden wins, it will be down in a week once he is in office!
Biden is in the basement,yes.
Strategically, I think Biden might do well to choose a young candidate who can take over in 4 years and easily go another 8.  How about AOC?
Trump says the stock market will tank if Biden is elected. Of course - Trump has been buying up stock like crazy to artificially inflate the market. It’s all a sham, just like the Trump presidency and how dangerous mail-in-voting is. Evil incarnate.

Did Biden remember to do it again and I see you have to meet you there I’m sorry
The only bright note is that VP Biden and a new government not consisting of corrupt grifters and bootlickers can roll all this shit back again beginning in January.  Man oh man... VP Biden's to-do list is going to be epic. Calling all lawyers!
You would do better under a Biden administration. He wouldn’t make fun of your family.

Yes the left resorts to this because, sadly, it’s true. Can’t dialogue with ppl who seriously think Biden isn’t better than Trump after seeing all of the ppl dying. At least Biden would have competent ppl in his administration.
Biden is currently at a projected 307 electoral votes, whereas Clinton was at only 272. VOTE!
Americans need to be able to believe what their president says. That ship has sailed for Donald Trump. We believe Joe Biden.
That's why  is better at everything then you  #COVID19 #coronavirus #VoteTrumpOut #TrumpCantRideABike #Biden
Joe Biden is a good person who will surround himself with experienced, smart, capable people who will protect social security, Medicare, Americans, healthcare and the institutions that keep us safe. And that is a hell of a lot better than what we have now. #TrumpsGenocide
Beautiful, isn't it?  Biden's people are too busy making weapons and posters in their basements. They only bring them out in the dark wearing their cute little black ninja/isis outfits. Creepy..
Wow..  Right  why do you think China would prefer Joe Biden they .. already own him Duh #ChinaGate
No, I think she's saying that we can only remove Trump through an election, so it's too risky to not vote for Biden.
Your father, like your grandfather, had severe cognitive decline. Unlike Biden, your Dad cannot string together a coherent sentence, walk down a ramp or pronounce basic words SO STOP PROJECTING!
In Biden's plan anyone can get into Medicare. If u elect Trump again u are fully screwed!

Not for nothing, but will Biden just pick a VP already.  I feel like I've been reading about how he's been narrowing down his list for a month now.
To be fair, Biden vs. Trump debates could be an HBO Comedy special
Yea they are... The Lincoln Project's members are republicans, among others, they're voting biden.
If Biden selected Dick Cheney I’m still voting for Joe.
Let’s watch.  “attacked for her ambition and ...for her bluntness.... In fact, we admire male politicians who are “really going places” and “tell it like it is.....just pay attention to how the women on Biden’s list of candidates are being talked about.”
"Why would anyone (Especially Black voters) listen to Racist, Rich, white, elitist and Fake Conservatives?" They voted one into office in 2016.... Kanye is mentally ill, Republicans are fraudulently trying to get him onto the ballots to steal potential votes for Biden.
You inflated a bubble. A crash is inevitable due to your idiocy.  Biden will have to raise taxes to prevent the government from collapsing.
Eerily prophetic if Biden wins.
Biden has plans for things...far from my favorite plans, but still plans

As predicted. The Ds have become so compromised by progressives it’s unlikely $$ will save us.  The Trump RW is targeting the LW socialist positions Biden has been forced to accept by extortion. Bloomberg has endured plenty of LW attacks for trying to help.  Bernie is a traitor.
Make no mistake: this is political Genius by Trump. He’s going to go on the war path against Pelosi and the Democrats, and that can only hurt Biden. It’s sad that things like *crucial pandemic relief* are partisan political bargaining chips, but that’s the US for ya!

White mfers really be mad that people don't like Biden. Yeah it's easy for you guys to say you want the "safe moderate" option because you don't NEED drastic change. Because Biden didn't say you're not white if you dont vote for him and Kamala didn't mass incarcerate ur people.

Prediction . . .   Biden suffers a stroke or something that will prevent him from accepting the formal nomination. Kamala will solemnly accept the nomination.  Of course, this is all scripted.
Well, I guess we will have to watch where they are spending. I think they have committed ~$280M to ad buys. But a lot of that money could be focused on retaining the house, not so much promoting Biden. I sure haven't seen too many Biden signs or bumperstickers, that's for sure.

Why do you object to the thought that Biden may decide to retire after one term?  Especially if he has accomplished the goals he set out to achieve, or at least, got us back in a good direction, and it looks likely that KH would be elected President in 2024? 🤷‍♂️

I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.

Joe biden doesn’t know where he is
Boy I hope he doesn't get heckled and laughed at by hundreds of Biden supporters who will be there. And I hope no one brings baby trump blimps, that might really upset him! #fucktrump🖕🖕🖕
Whatever. Once a WEEK a reporter will ask Trump a tough question, that he quickly ignores. Biden should ignore the useless press corps who are just aiding and abetting Trump.
Wow, keep going with the misgendering. Really making you look good here.  If you arent convinced by looking at Biden's record that he's shit and won't do anything then all I can say is you are willfully ignorant.
I speak the truth about Biden
I have seen two Biden signs in my neighborhood. Gross
Really? You cant decipher that? Or are you just deflecting because it's true?  Biden won't do shit for anyone or the environment. Why? Because his policy record says so.
If you believe Biden will do anything progressive thats on his policy platform, I have news for you.  You have been duped.
Thats w weird thing to say. Your saying what he will do, but really eon't, to get you through your day.  I look at the reality of Joe Biden
via    But just consider a single day, Tuesday, when Joe Biden announced Harris as his pick. Covid-19 took the lives of 1,450 people in the United States on that one day. For Canada, it was four.
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden  👍
Reliable pollster Rasmussen says 1/3rd of black voters "less likely" to vote for Biden now.  Blacks stay home, Bernie Bros too. Nihilist BLMs and Antifas do not vote.  Dem turnout way down. Trump enthusiasm sky high. Pushes turnout through the roof for GOP. Trump 62% Biden 38%.
Biden is responsible for why we have Trump. Anything Trump does we can thank Biden for.
From my  piece earlier this year — has Biden answered this problem by making Harris one of “Our Own?”
Absentee ballot is safe, the mass mailout ballot is not not tell the whole story Mr Biden 2 different systems
If Dems win, they will choose to "look forward, not back." Biden will continue most of the same policies, normalizing them. Trump will say something mildly critical of the next GOP fascist to be "elected" and be hailed as a part of the #Resistance.  If the US makes it that far.
Biden made Trump possible.
amplify this message now! Let them do their job!
Hate to disappoint you. Remember,half the country still likes Trump. Biden is a complete idiot!
Can't wait for the debates! Trump will eat Biden's lunch!
somehow your twitter bio rings hollow. “I’m not GOP or Dem” followed by Harris/Biden 2020. Yeah, you’re right down the middle...Lol
Biden should make a prime time address to the nation on how to vote by mail and submit it EARLY. And just leave Trump's name out of it.
I always laugh a little when people on the right call Joe Biden a liberal... like the dude is conservative... liberal and democrat are not the same thing...
We lack a consistent national policy on treating COVID-19. I suggest the 50 US governors get together and create a consistent, uniform policy on treating this pandemic. Please support VP Biden's call for a national mask mandate implemented by governors as you've already done.

This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
“We aren’t going to let Biden and Harris cut our meat.” 🤣🤣 Better go buy your steak now before it’s too late .  God I hope there is a VP debate.
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
This is hysterical. Biden can’t speak, won’t debate, Kamala calls him a racist and old guard and now they’re a power house team? How is voter id, suppression? Mail in is/has ans aleays wil be fraud ridden. Do you want sovialism or America the beautiful!
Dear  You can turn the mail sorters back on. Your country is counting on you. Our future depends on it.
I tried giving you my reasoning for why Biden is as bad as Trump. I literally tried having a conversation with you. I asked you to show me the policies Biden enacted that makes him better. Never once will you willing to actually engage in what I was saying.
Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
#FletcherAlum  (F19) spoke with  about the #2020Election and a potential #Biden presidency.  Watch below  👀
I really dont see Biden being able to do any better.  Were also going to continue to get brutalized by the police.
Biden's policies have affected me and you personally because they are why we have Trump. Anything Trump does to us, we can thank Biden for it.
Biden wont
No religion needed. You blindly follow Biden and Harris.  Cult
They are the same. Biden is also responsible for why we have Trump.  Good idea, cure a disease by injecting the same disease and hope it gets better.  Yeah you're in a cult
What the fuck is with people calling Biden and Harris family members. I saw someone call them mom and dad and now aunt and uncle. This is cult-like behavior.  #BlueMAGA
Ive been having an honest discussion the entire time.  The thing is, I'm right. Biden is a fascist. Biden is responsible for why we have Trump. It's like you only want to win and dont want to hear my perspective.
What issues did you bring up? Biden isnt better than Trump on a single issue. Caging kids? Started under Biden. Police brutality, yeah that happened under Biden. Biden also wrote policies that made Trump possible. How are you not getting this?
You just proved our point. Thank you. Biden and Trump are the same.
Your arguing Biden is better. Thats why
I always love these predictions. There is no way to refute them. You can’t be wrong. 10,000 people die, would have been 50,000. 60,000 die, would have been 100,000. As Biden says, it’s horse puckey.
I'm not. It was shown to you that Biden &amp; Harris are ok with the human rights violations. You're making it out that its ok if they do that and making it seem like we all shouldn't be concerned with that
Biden is a fascist.
So then tell me what policies in Biden's past makes him so good. I want specific policies and how they actually improved the lives of the masses. I sure as hell can't find any. In fact, I can see that his policies are responsible for why it was even possible for Trump's election.
Really? So I'm sure you can tell me which policies that Biden has enacted that makes him so great?
🤣🤣🤣  Biden isn't better. Please tell me where in his record shows that he's better because, in reality, we have Trump due to Biden's policies.  Biden isn't progressive and he's no better than Trump
⚪️Trump lies all the time and he’s just being Trump.   🔘Biden doesn’t take questions with Harris on Day 2 of VP rollout and Johnathan Martin is getting high-minded about accountability.
Biden has written plenty of bills that pushed this country further right. Trumpism is here to stay. The DNC is ok with this. They get an enemy they can scare us with. Biden terrifies me more than Trump due to his policy record being a big reason the country is where it is.
You can vote for a third party or an independent.  No one wants Trump or worse than Trump but voting for Biden just tells the DNC they can keep running further and further left candidates, which will in turn cause the republicans to go further right.
Harris may have perfected the craft of "advise and consent" with Justice Kavanaugh, but there is only one founder of "This Is Personal" style Senate hearings, the creator of Borking, Mr. Joe Biden.
Keep dreaming. Were just going to get worse and worse. Voting for Biden enables that.
It's not just Hilary. Its been moving this way since Regan. There are a lot of things that contribute to why it was possible for getting Trump. Joe Biden is one of those reasons
Lol. So what you're saying is you dont understand the history of what led to the point where Trump could even get elected. This wasn't a fluke. This is the country that has been moving further right. You can thank Joe Biden for that.
It is a matter of values. Your strategy of voting whoever the DNC puts in front of you is exactly why we have Trump right now. Put Joe Biden in and then we get Tom Cotton in 2024. Great strategy

Not safekeeping. Fact. Biden is the architect of the 94 crime bill and copmala is all for it and imprisoning people who shouldn't be imprisoned.  Neither of them are for a single progressive policy.  There also neolibs who are fascist enablers.  That's not progressive.
You certainly aren't progressive if you're voting for Biden.

Don't worry. The more time Biden and Harris spend in front of an unbiased camera, people will figure it out. Marketing can only take you so far.
Nope, I'm voting for Biden.
the higher turnout goes, the wider Biden’s margin over Trump
I think it's important to remember that the president is only as powerful as congress lets them be. Biden sucks, but get some progressives in congress and fix our elections. Making our elections fair removes all establishment power, as AOC showed us in 2016 with her 82% win.
Biden wants to help poor people obtain stable housing? Can’t wait to vote for him. Thanks for the heads up, Donald.
Kamala Harris Gives New Meaning to the Biden Campaign
Patients, healthcare professionals and researchers, hopeful that Biden and Harris might prioritize funding for and support for #cancerresearch if elected in November, as they both have strong ties to the disease.
Of course there's much at stake every single day. It didn't matter to me how long or how Biden announced the choice what mattered most to me is who was chosen - he chose wisely. The campaign energy has been low - I hope this choice re-energizes Dems/Independents/Lincoln Repubs
Joe Biden proves again that he doesn't actually care about the struggles that the disenfranchised people of America have to go through every day. He had the opportunity to select a real progressive as his VP and instead chose this rat.
The Democrats hated that Iowa and New Hampshire had such an impact on their nominee. Harris and Biden were 5th and 6th in those primaries. They just got a stick in the eye. Their opinion does not count.  Trump wins both states easily.
I hope Harris helps prepare Biden for the debates. Need to be as sharp as possible. Trump supporters overlook the presidents flaws and focus on Biden’s.
Trevor Noah Reacts to Joe Biden’s Decision to Pick Kamala Harris for Vice President  via
Don't pretend like this shouldn't be an issue that the dem base should have with the dems.  Biden/Harris are running on a Republican Lite platform. Unless we A. Raise hell like we have been this summer over the next 4 yrs or B. Overthrow the current system, nothing's changing.
Biden &amp; Harris have failed to support a genuine universal healthcare plan, opposed marijuana legalization and thereby opposed freeing POC wrongly incarcerated for drug charges, and resist supporting the dismantling kf the prison industrial complex bc their careers are tied to it.
Anybody who's telling people dissatisfied with the Biden/Harris ticket that they have to suck it up and vote for them is morally obliged to be out in the streets raising hell with those same people when Biden/Harris inevitably do nothing to dismantle the prison system.
Amazing.

Gundlach – Trump will Defeat Biden; Avoid the Bond Market
Again, ho take your meds. Joe Biden can and will outrun you.
Imagine how Trump would respond to a woman who publicly challenged and criticized him. Especially a strong, non-white woman.   Harris may be a pragmatic or political choice for Biden. But they’re already showing themselves to care less about their egos and more about the office.
I can think of no greater contrast between our current petty, grievance-driven president than this: '"I’m not good at keeping hard feelings,' Biden told her."  Keeping hard feelings is about all Trump IS good at!   via
Tufts Psychology is very excited to be co-hosting a colloquium with  and  on October 7. Our speaker will be  who just published  op-ed on Kamala Harris:
No, it doesnt. There's nothing to back that statement up.  Biden isn't the lesser of evils. He is the evil that is directly responsible for why we have Trump.  Other choices are not a theory. they exist. You can vote for them. You choose to vote to keep things shit for people.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President  ALL RIGHT 👍
via  Under her gaze, Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. As he watches helplessly, Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her.
And then you have Trump calling strong women nasty and using racist language. “‘One of the reasons that it surprised me is -- she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden,’ Trump said at the White House on Tuesday.”
Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her. This isn’t any ordinary clash of perspectives and philosophies. It’s an extraordinary collision of life experiences.
That's right, Tim. Nickelback was Biden's VP. All 17 of them
Is Biden going to put windmills in our beautiful beautiful suburbs? Why is he talking about windmills ffs?
I mean, I’m holding my nose and voting for Joe Biden of all people. That I don’t like his vp isn’t gonna stop this leftist from voting out the fascist. (We can work on educating the capitalists in the meantime &amp; afterwards :) )

Joe Biden Picks Kamala Harris As VP | Rational Live!  IT FEELS LIKE A NEW ERA 🌹🌻🌞  via
I love to go vote for Joe Biden/Kamala Harris and feel so invigorated and full of joy and hope that i need to go to a bar where they dont let the poors or minorities in to go celebrate being such a good, productive member or society 🤗
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
Great choice. Go Biden/Harris
some good news in these trying times: this means that biden will possibly be picking up hil's former media team along with kamala. time to "pokemon go to the polls" again!
This is a strong ticket.  All the way with Biden and Harris!
Yes! Biden and Harris!
Ugh I wish we could go back to 2016 and be excited about Clinton-Harris instead of confused with Clinton-Kaine or resigned to Biden-Harris
I guess the plane was a ruse.  It's Kamala.
Makes perfect sense.  Perhaps I am too optimistic, but I suspect we will get there under Biden.
Let's see if the Biden campaign is smart enough to wait to announce the veep pick until right after Trump walks on stage for his daily televised masturbation session.
Biden's handlers are excited about all the changes Trump made, and just want someone they can control to use it.
We need the ENTIRE Biden coalition, including progressives, youngsters, Republicans, all races and genders. #BidenCoalition
Interesting. I don’t like Rice, but I’d still pick a Biden-Rice ticket over the other options. Jill Stein has destroyed any support I may once have had for the Green Party.From   “Trump plans to taunt Biden near his childhood home hours before the Democratic National Convention.”  What Trump doesn’t know: Happy Fun Ball is also scheduled to appear at Biden’s home simultaneously.  Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. 🥎
True Hillary level cringe would’ve been Biden announcing her as VP through a TikTok or on Fortnite Party Royale
tbh both are fucking horrible im literally only voting biden bc its not trump but i HATE biden too n i think trump is way worse
You right Biden will be sleeping . Probably for most of the day
Do what is best for you and your country.  Support Biden in order to RID us of Trump! Do not throw your vote away.
can’t wait for biden to sniff kamala on TV lol
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president
Why would anyone vote to bring Obama’s and Biden’s policy failures and leadership back ?  We have so much more to protect then even before .  Voting proudly for Trump
"What Difference does it make"     Why not ask you this same question we all know you are doing the same thing.    And Joe Biden must answer for his 44 years of lying
There seems to be some misunderstanding.  Just because I don't intend to vote for Trump does not mean I'm voting for Biden
Only foreign policy Biden ever achieved was to steal money while he sold us out
Biden and his kind are the ones that created decades of inequalities So now he says he will make it better 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣If someone believes that they are stupid
You look fab, of course. How excited are we? Biden Harris! Already ordered my gear ready to work.
I certainly does not. Do you really think Biden would have selected her after months of vetting if there was the slightest doubt she could not be president? Get serious.
No, they threw away the Pandemic Playbook left for them by the Obama/Biden Administration.
Most of the MSM ignored Tara Reade, then briefly conceded the accusations exist, then shutup about it as to not hurt his chances in the primary. So to the DNC and your friends in the MSM... well played as always👍👏👏👏
I wonder how much phonebanking he’s done for Biden
How many millions of citizens are planning on attending the Biden/Harris inauguration in January?
Thats terribly misquoted there. Trumps referring to something Biden said.
Biden stop already
If Biden wins all of these awful comedians are going to be entirely out of a job. Nobody’s going to want to hear this about Biden, not even the conservatives.
Insulting people is the best way to beg for their vote. You’ve got some real Biden-brain energy.
Joe Biden should run for the president of Kickassia to take the title of Nostalgia Critic away from the fascist Doug Walker
R.I. bishop throws shade at Biden with snarky tweet
You know I'm not a Biden supporter right?   Best custom shirt ever
You do know I'm not voting for Biden right?
Plenty of great people the dems could have gone with....they picked Biden and Harris  #VoteHouse2020
Of course she didn't! She was just saying...??? No. If you take just a few seconds to think about it, she definitely was calling him a racist.
Yeah, I don't know. I remember predictions that Biden would clean Sarah Palin's clock in the 2008 VP debate, and that Paul Ryan would do the same to Biden in 2012, and neither happened. If you can memorize talking points, you can hold your own in this debate format. #Election2020
So, "Joe Biden is Catholic" is trending this morning on Twitter.  #CatholicTwitter #Election2020 #politics
Strange in a non gender society Biden had to pick a "woman" vp
I’m not 100% sure Biden even knows who she is. The man is not fit for public office.
I can't wait to call Joe Biden Mr. President .
This is a lie. Biden has never been part of the far left wing. He ran and won as a moderate when many thought it was the year of the far left to take over the party. He held and holds positions the far left is uncomfortable with. Biden-Harris will win. Humanity will be restored.
Do you think he’s gonna let Biden upstage him he’s gonna drop pence and come up with his own women Vice President he will pick Sara palin his moron base loves her lol
Insignificant who Biden picked . We might flip a few house seats in Cali .
Exactly why im voting Biden Harris they have a lot of work to do but the Democrats always have to clean up after the Repbulicans will do it.
We dont care who he picked we are voting Biden because we need to get the Pysco who is letting Americans die and the economy tank out of office say whatever you want about her.#VOTEBLUETICKET
never heard of the one running with Biden going for Trump.
I don't even need to read the article. The 4 reasons he picked her: 1. Fuck Bernie 2. Fuck the left 3. Fuck the country 4. Fuck the world. Nothing will fundamentally change.
Since you’re so concerned about trump being a racist, are you equally as concerned about Biden’s constant racism?
It is always interesting to see what the opposite political party will attack the other with. Why is it a negative Biden picked someone who was quite outspoken against him during the debates, doesn’t it show maturity to not let personal feelings get in the way?
Reminder that the cops don’t care about sexual assault
Proud to be a liberal progressive who will strongly support the Biden Harris 2020 ticket. You repukes are from a by gone era.
Cannot trust the US Mail system.  Will be voting for Biden/Harris in person.
Biden's new logo with Harris has slightly different typeface and I hate it
Yes indeed. I was prepared to be disappointed but would still get out there now I’m trying to order every bit of campaign gear I can get. Do you think the Biden Harris acid wash jeans are too much?
Went to buy my new Biden/Harris tshirt, bumper stickers, pins, coffee mug, beach towel, throw pillow and maybe even a bed spread but the store is overwhelmed! Such a good day.
Thank you for being such a classy lady.  I hope Biden/Harris will pull you into their administration. You would be a great addition.
The Biden Harris store is overwhelmed. This is SUCH a good day.
You understand it was slick w/ rain water and very dangerous. He also did not ask for guidance it was out of respect . Biden in a million years could not keep up the rigors of the office . He can’t even campaign .
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
&amp; here we go! Biden/Harris 2020🤘🏽
I would’ve voted for Joe Biden in November but everything he’s done since Bernie dropped out has told me that he doesn’t want my vote. I don’t have a problem with you if you decide to, but I’m gonna sit this one out
Five months seems about right. I’m hoping for March 2021, but that’s predicated on a Biden presidency and a Democratic Congress starting to dig us out of the bigly sized hole Trump and the GOP are leaving us in.
I've heard so much from you and trump over the past five years that even if there were no debates, I'd still vote for Biden. That's the consequence of your consistent "party over country" approach.  Oh, and your party has become thoroughly racist.
I think you might be ready for a job with the Biden campaign now.
UNholy poopoo.  Can’t wait to see him in debate Biden.  Does he even listen to himself?
oomfs, i’ve already tweeted about this before but i will be without my phone or any wifi the next two weeks. if biden decides to do something big please yell at me in my dm’s and don’t unfollow me for inactivity xxx
Who’s the funniest person Biden could pick to be Vice President?
What a time to be alive. Biden could literally have not given a speech and had the same number of votes. Instead he talks about his golden leg hair
All this talk about mail in ballots aren’t going to work.... China want Biden.... Russia wants Trump..... why don’t we let the Russians and the Chinese elect our President
joe biden definitely did not tweet this
Why did the Democrat’s nominate Biden ... can’t wait until the debates.... they should of chosen #Michelle Obama
MSNBC Supercut Shows How Every Trump Line Of Attack On Biden Can Backfire
In 1977 Biden said interracial schooling would create a racial jungle he didnt want his kids to attend
and he doesn't have a group of sexual assault accusers to parade into the room with Biden. He always needs a gimmick.
The other day I went to a mechanic’s. He had Limbaugh on the radio yelling about how Biden will close all churches forever. Of me, him and his crew, other customers, only I wore a mask &amp; kept distance. And *I* felt like the weird person

Imagine if you were able to speak about the greatness of Joe Biden and how amazing of president he'll. If you could proudly state his policies daily with enthusiasm &amp; joy. Instead, you have to talk bad all the time about Trump. Its better to vote FOR something instead of Against!
We’ve had 4 years and the best we could come up with was Joe Biden. What a fucking joke. I don’t believe in politics and I never will.
but we just don't hear or rarely see Joe Biden..?  Hmm.
Taylor swifts tweets ab the post office are so performative... she says vote trump out but didn’t give any resources on voter registry or tell us if she donated to Biden Harris
Biden isn’t even anti-gun
You make $4,000 per week and claim people who have been forced out of work by the Trump administration's inept handling of the pandemic do not deserve $600 per week. We don't care about your lies, Joe Biden is going to be the next president.
Do you really think he’s losing sleep over establishment Kamala?  The entire country rejected her just a couple months after she ran for president.  She called Biden a racist and says she believes his sexual accusers. You think she’s truly “team Biden?”  Easy win for Trump.
For shits and giggles, cause I don’t think we’re changing your mind...what if Biden wins decidedly...what would that mean to you?
"In picking the California senator, Biden couldn’t be clearer that his will be an administration dedicated to shoring up a crumbling status quo." -  +
Black and elderly people are disproportionately impacted by the removal of letter boxes and shutdown of post offices. Both of these demo graphs largely poll for Biden and have historically been redistricted to suppress their ability to vote. So, no. It doesn't effect both equally
Wish I lived in one of those areas. Unfortunately I'm in Biden country lol.
Senator, you should be reminded that destroying any of your documents is a felony.   Seems to me that you are ALL in on defeating joe Biden because you are ALL in with a foreign adversary’s intend to keep a corrupt administration in power. You are dirty, sir. When did you turn?

Name that comes up often in Biden Ukraine search is  - for yrs now appears to be blatantly telling MSM not to cover it. Something not adding up if they are that nervous.
Have we cured AIDS since 1980? Is there a vaccine? Yet for Covid we should have one already? This would be over if Biden were president? He has a better plan? A Mask Mandate- Really. So Masks first, quell the riots (cure AIDS) &amp; restore the economy. So easy! And not at all dumb!
The Biden campaign has used this pandemic to attempt to cancel fair presidential debates. Biden has used the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to blame on Trump and portray himself as the only economic savior of this country. Think again about who is taking advantage..
Why no questions to our possible next president?   What are they hiding?   Biden has dementia and even if elected he won’t be running our country the deep state corrupt actors will be running us.    Soros will be the president.
Good old Hussein is right about Biden’s ineptitude.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Why is the media tolerating these rules of asking Biden no questions?

Will Biden ever do a sit down interview? Seems to be cowering away from any hard hitting questions.
These people aren't "Biden" voters. It's a good meme, decent propaganda...but they're anarchists. Some of the larger crowd will vote for him, but the ones scheming this stuff aren't any more likely to vote for him than Trump.
To paraphrase a mentally impaired man currently running for America's highest office, if you're still wondering whether you're going to vote for Biden or Trump then you ain't libertarian.

biden could endorse m4a
Isn't this what Biden tried to do? Except this is holding workers hostage for s political agenda,pretty sure it's a crime.
With Biden in charge it will be the real deal a bloody affair that "reasserts the global leadership of the USA" or some other Public Relations, bullshit  Trump said he wouldn't recognize an electoral loss prior to "winning" in  2016 so repeating the same thing is no surprise
had the nerve to say President Trump “coddles” terrorists.   What planet is this lunatic on?  You mean like give Iran $150M in cash plus much more.  😂 Just another LIE from Biden
Trump tried to regime change Venezuela, it was the kind of half assed effort that has put him at logger heads with John Bolton &amp; the Neocons, the same Neocons who now back Biden so it's not a wash &amp; you are downplaying the imperialism that Biden represents &amp; why Neocons back him
if anyone thinks this alone means trump is less bad than biden, as opposed to equally bad, you are a fucking idiot, frankly

Because it is 5 months until Biden is sworn in.
Real world: woman sometimes have careers then families. Guys are not caring for these woman, they are left with no money, no homes, abused and embarrassed to talk about it!! This is America! Biden did not  care. I'm a survivor, Am I glad? A different story to tell
Biden is hoping voters will choose him over Trump, like a comfortable blanket, bonded to people by that empathy — and his own history of grief.
CNN providing free propaganda for the Biden campaign! Shameful.
Biden / Harris 2020 " we must Support. ? Elect      ☮️💓
Here us another woman tragedy story. Your newborn child looses her father to heroin, FENTANYL coming accross our borders. I was shocked to hear she is given $500 a month to live on. Shocked! Woman and children first? Biden never gave it a thought!! Or did Obama!!
That would be garish. Biden doesn’t need superficial stuff like that. He’s the real deal.  #TrumpPandemicFailure #BidenHarris2020
what do u think joe biden’s opinion on cat girls is
Its nice to be rich, you would know, but poor because you gave time to your children  only to have your husband run off with another woman? Then there is the guy who never married you.SSDI is what ya get and its NOT ENOUGH FOR WOMAN. Biden never cared in 6 years!!
Inside the 3-month search for Biden's VP pick
In six years Biden did nothing for SSDI people earning low pay, ZERO raises in 6 yrs. WOMAN, once again are discriminated against! We are earning less, because we are home caring for children!!
I'm transgender. Fuck Biden. He wont do shit for me
Figuring a disability check is done by recent work, well that is discrimination to woman, we work great jobs for 30 yrs, take time for a family of 3, now an unexpected domestic violence tragedy leaves women earning the lowest rate, $10,000 per year? Biden did zero!

I heard Pence was governor before. This guy has no mind of his own. He worships trump. Like trump said, “if I tell him to drop his pants he will”. This is their relationship.
Should he not have used drone strikes to kill terrorist? Lets not forget he took out 22 of the top 25 leaders in a Al-Qaeda. What should he have done differently? He also voted against the Iraq war so lets not forget that. As for Biden that bum has never seen a war he didn't love
Weekend at Bernie’s —I mean Biden’s
Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements.
Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
how is it my fault biden would veto m4a?
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

Gotcha.  I dunno, I think Biden would still want her in the senate.
There is no way we could here in MA- they would really damage our home. But they can put Biden signs up? The hypocrisy is astounding
What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.
Biden campaign working day and night to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
They are doing this to hide Biden. Look at the fire over here, and not our candidate who is “funny” to say the least.

Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough
With all that is happening to the country, Wisconsin must be so proud that their senator is devoting all his effort to investigating what Hunter Biden did two years ago.
That’s the joke, dim wit, it wasn’t sarcasm. He loves TAys Sway... Hes just now admitting that he’s a Biden fan as well.
Trump campaign plans huge digital ad buy ahead of DNC, as Biden airs first ad with Harris

Hunter Biden is irrelevant. Ivanka &amp; Jared have earned big bucks working in the WH. #MostCorruptAdministrationEver #TraitorTrump #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
I know.  She should make the list.  She'll be their biggest draw outside of Obama, Biden, and Harris.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
I imagine the argument is that there are people who want to defund the police who are still willing to vote for Biden and that's hypocritical (as if keeping Trump will help defund the police)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris looked pretty good in their matching navy blue masks on Wednesday.
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.

Since Biden has the yips, a 2 foot putt is no gimme for Joe.   Dan, do you recall Obama rolling gutter balls &amp; throwing balloons on Opening Day.  Trump doesn’t have the yips. He throws strikes, doesn’t plagiarize, air edited tapes, or spy on opponents.  So who’s the cheat, Dan?
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!

Oh, absolutely. CAP senior staff will all almost certainly have high ranking posts in the Office of Making Sure Medicare For All Never Happens in the Biden admin so probably the most helpful thing they could do is just stay mum for the duration but I don’t see that happening

IMHO -- Biden/Harris INFINITELY better on ALL #cannabis issues than Trump, who will continue to appoint reactionary judges. Even if Biden &amp; Harris haven't been spectacular on issue, all the people around them will be much better than Trump's ideologues.
Biden should do ANY talk show or take ANY questions!!!!
Agreed. That's why we're voting for Biden/Harris.
Ummm nobody in America wants Biden either..
My neighborhood has no signs but it's a solid blue district. However we got a lot of unionists (it's Boston, y'all) that have visited the town rallying for Biden as well.
Biden's America.
The Ratchet Effect is even worse this time because Coronavirus gifted the primary to Biden. There's not been any of the dealmaking you typically see in the run up to the general because Biden has no NEED to compromise with anyone.

So, Biden will promise to move those kids to different cages and then not even do that?
We're lucky to have groups like    working to help ensure more people vote for Biden.  They're MUCH better at creating honest, smart, &amp; hard-hitting pieces than the Dems are 🤦🏼‍♂️.
I haven’t decided how I’m gonna vote yet (changed my mind from hard no vote to lean no vote). But a lot of people who dedicate their lives to the unglamourous social justice/poverty work are sitting this one out- and if Biden/Harris fail to convince them otherwise, that’s on them

Yep, Don't show Biden and the non-existing policies.  Just "but Trump"  You could run a cardboard box against Trump and win.  Biden's team will most certainly lose.
You're both right 🙂 A third party vote is a vote Biden failed to earn that only functions to help elect Trump.   If you have no preference between Biden and Trump then feel free.
biden needs to heed it now
If Warren were to join a Biden administration, Pressley would almost certainly run in the special election, right? That’s why this is Joe’s best shot.

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.

and if we all actually did our research and realized the validity of third party maybe there’d be some fucking movement and progress within it. it doesn’t HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. seriously people, wake the fuck up. Biden is just a moderate, slightly less problematic Trump.
A website doesn’t sell policy effectively. Why doesn’t Biden himself ever outline his policy vision? Candidates like Warren, Sanders, Castro, &amp; Yang made detailed policy proposals in every public appearance. Biden refuses to describe how he’d govern so it’s hard to support him.

I just wanna be clear-Joe Biden could literally try to murder me and I would find a way to roll my comatose ass to the polls and vote for him on November 3rd.

therefore cannot be equated with “helping trump” despite all the propaganda surrounding it.   liberals want anything anti biden to be pro-trump, so that way you aren’t allowed to be anti-biden (or anti-democrat) which is v fascist imo.   now you know, please don’t play into this.
such as my state, massachusetts, where biden will win by 30% of the vote.  most states are like this.  only a handful are “swing states” where there’s a chance the state flips.  because my state is decided, not supporting biden has zero effect on the election outcome and -
in the usa, presidential election is decided by counting up electoral votes, which are assigned by states’ winners.  so whoever wins my state, (biden) gets all 12 electoral votes.  then whoever hits 270 first wins.   at least 40 out of 50 states are very much decided...

No, what he says is that bad.  And what he does is that bad.  And he is absolutely right wing who is supporting Trump over Biden.  He is garbage.
Prediction: if Biden gets elected (or if Trump doesn’t completely sabotage our election system), we are in for a run of 3–4 one-term presidents, each of whom runs on a “change” platform, and each of whom will be impeached at some point during that one term.
Done!  Thanks for the recommendation.

Believe it or not, pressure campaigns work.  Trump, like all bullies, is a COWARD.  If we stand up to him publicly and loudly, he will back down.  We’ve seen it happen several times already.  Protest.   Tweet.   Call Congress.   Call Talk Radio.   Donate to Biden/Harris.
Happy to see the Biden campaign actively disputing misinformation right out the gate. Harris’ own campaign should have demolished that Lara Baezlon article day one.
The timeline of Trump and Guiliani's coordinated effort to bribe or extort Ukraine into manufacturing dirt about Hunter Biden is far odder and more damning, but you couldn't be bothered to take an interest in that during an impeachment trial.
So he is going to give a speech before Biden gives a speech. That will go well.

Biden’s gaffes, lack of discipline.   They would chortle at how Biden, like an elderly uncle at Thanksgiving, would launch into extended monologues that everyone had heard before.  Former administration officials treated Biden dismissively in their memoirs
I think there was a severe opposition campaign from the establishment wing of the Democrats to propel Biden to the nomination.  Bernie had tremendous energy and was railroaded for the second time in a row.  Warren failed by attacking by Bernie too aggressively.

President Joe Biden &amp; Vice President Kamala Harris -2020!!
Welcome.
telling those “biden equals trump” idiots to read the fine print.
Joe Biden is a coward.  Kamala Harris dreams about running a fiefdom.  Nobody should be surprised by this combo.
wake the fuck up - same as biden/harris? really? really?  and this is just the fucking small print!!!
"Fine people" is all Biden/CNN/MSNBC/Huff Post have.   That's it. Other than this clear lie, the well is dry.
Nazi George Soros chose Kamala Harris. He controls Hillary, Obama, Biden, and about 95% of the Democrats. Follow the money and see.
Biden outreach program to leftists going great!
You lost 300,000 votes last night. 300,000 votea for Joe Biden!. usps carriers and more..So F you! You screw with. the usps you get it taken away from you-! You loose!
Yes, so Biden and Kamala are on the TWAW train. We're going to have to fight that it. You have to be alive, healthy, not hiding and not in jail to fight that.  Will you be alive, healthy and free at the end of another four years of Trump?   Answer honestly.
Harris/Biden ticket.
I didn't know that and would have to research it. But here's the thing. I can fight her on those things when I'm safe and my partner is safe. Another four years of Trump is untenable.   It's back her and Biden or accept that we'll be dead or dirt poor in four years.
correct their own June 26 post that "Biden Floats Baseless Election Conspiracy".

Weekend at Joe Biden
You obviously don’t actually listen to  . Joe Biden called Gov. Baker “Charlie Parker”. Howie references this quite often.
“Joe Biden had the audacity to choose a Black woman to be his running mate. How incredible is that? And what a statement that is about Joe Biden.” — Kamala Harris
General, you still actually think Trump isn’t tougher on China than Biden would be? I’d like to see more action against China as well, but between Trump v. Biden, seems manifest that Trump is tougher.
I just ordered a Biden/Harris mask.  I wonder if it would be allowed in a polling place. I’m guessing not, as campaigning  inside such places is not on.
Ha! Biden WENT THERE!
If the election were held today, Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website projects that Democrat Joe Biden would beat Trump in the Electoral College 307 to 186, well above the 270 votes Biden needs to win. -- Boston Globe
President Joseph R. Biden.
Because Biden answers the questions without being asked, you deflect and ignore.  You act like a spoiled child and are ignorant.
Evil and power hungry is hard to differentiate between her and Hillary, but with Clinton out of the picture, Harris is the bigger threat to our country. She will be the President if Biden wins. The left will finally admit he is mentally unsuitable.
Imagine that, the president's ads lie about  Next question, eh,
No... They didn't. Please do some basic research on this topic before you make yourself look like the biggest dumbass on the planet.  Hillary was only up by 2 or 3 points in 2016. Biden is currently up at least 7 points consistently, sometimes going up to above 10.
Why do you think Biden is pushing the mandatory mask thing – to give himself an excuse and cover for staying in the basement
why don't you explore the question of why biden and harris have gone 3 days with taking reporters questions and refused to go on live tv on Sunday.     ???
White mfers really be mad that people don't like Biden. Yeah it's easy for you guys to say you want the "safe moderate" option because you don't NEED drastic change. Because Biden didn't say you're not white if you dont vote for him and Kamala didn't mass incarcerate ur people.
We have to decide who we would rather negotiate with. Personally, I would rather deal with Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence.
If they had endorsed Biden she would be dead silent. As proven by the fact that many other unions have endorsed Biden and she’s been dead silent.  Also it’s hard to see their endorsement as political when they’re just supporting the candidate who doesn’t want them dead
We don't just need something to change, we need EVERYTHING TO CHANGE.
Joe Biden to rich donors: "Nothing would fundamentally change" if he's elected
So should Joe Biden and Donald Trump
Biden should do whatever works to get elected. He doesn’t owe you anything.  He’s been in the public view his entire adult life. People know what he’s about. And they know Trump is a criminal and a lazy moron to boot.
I am ready. Whatever you tell me to do.
Saving American democracy?? you people gotta relax, take deep breaths in the nose &amp; out the mouth, and realize Biden is NOT THE ENEMY.
Twitter Labels Anti-Trump Ad 'Manipulated Media' After Sean Hannity Complains
“It doesn’t have to snowball,” said  “...But if the president is saying, ‘Stop. I think I won, where did these blue shift ballots come from?’ You could have this dispute spin out of control.”
So, to get their number (Trump wins 27/100, Biden: 73/100) they run 40,000 simulations each day. Even if they put in all the same data, the various scenarios accounted for by the model would likely give slightly different numbers depending on the specific 40,000 scenarios it ran.
But exactly how is it manipulated? But showing hannity discussing Biden, but showing Trump’s face &amp; actions in the background? It’s very obviously demonstrating blatant hypocrisy- just as the looters ad does.
I haven’t even seen a Joe Biden for President bumper sticker. So how is Biden beating President Trump.
LOL fighting? Biden’s hiding in his basement.
Biden may not be the best but he’s already won the primary. It’s the only option at this point. Hopefully in 4 years we’ll have two better candidates. But for now, we just have to get the current occupant out.
Boston's tabloid newspaper, the Herald, which has been on life support for many years and is certain to expire soon, writes: "Biden’s VP pick makes history, but not much sense." With so little staff, the paper is edited in Denver. Can you tell?

Joe Biden Mockingly Urges People To Take Donald Trump's Word On One Specific Issue #SmartNews
I just finished a 50 mile bike ride around heavily Democrat Massachusetts I did not see one Biden sign. I saw about 20 Trump signs.

Here's Biden on violence against women:
Here's Biden on the opioid and heroin epidemic:
Here's Biden on violent crime (citing my plan from #BleedingOut):
" asked for each candidate’s views on nine specific areas of crime... #Biden’s response on the nine issues stretched over four pages... #Trump did not respond to the nine issues and provided no explanation."
Not a solid argument. Trump feels no compunction to tell the truth, or answer at all. Biden would not feel morally able to conduct himself in that way, so it’s hardly a level playing field. We usually don’t have candidates that lie like trump, so let Biden figure it out.
#SaturdayThoughts #JoeBiden and #KamalaHarris it would be Biden and Obama in steroids, #Socialism  #DemConvention #DemocratsForTrump
Biden should do whatever helps him win. Plenty of time for pressers once elected
Interesting idea ... At the DNC, Joe Biden should take a page from Apple product announcements. (Thread)
Whatever. Once a WEEK a reporter will ask Trump a tough question, that he quickly ignores. Biden should ignore the useless press corps who are just aiding and abetting Trump.
Oof.  He absolutely has lost support since 2016, especially in the last year, where he has continually failed on every count.   Not to mention Biden is far more popular than Hillary.  He might win, but he will win with equivalent or worse votes than 2016.
Now please tell me how you Senators who have the answers from these investigations are not screaming from the rooftops how corrupt Joe Biden is and can not run for President of this country.......
And this is a lovely list of some of the reasons I adore her: she is strong, she has awesome snark when attacked, and she keeps her cool under pressure. Oh, yeah, and a strong ethical compass.  Perfect? Nope. Is Biden perfect? Nope. Am i voting for them? YOU BET! #BidenHarris
Also known as "lies."  Trump Ads Attack Biden Through Deceptive Editing and Hyperbole
Joe Biden is Still lying after all these years!
Agree but Trump rarely answers tough questions.  He sidesteps them, swats them away, berates reporters who asks questions he's uncomfortable answering, etc.  So until Trump starts "answering" questions, then Biden doesn't need to hold weekly press conferences.
you’re just proving my point:  listen to those smart people already leading a change instead of rejecting the fact that no matter how bad biden is, trump’s second tenure will be hell! i mean literally.   nazi SC for starters.  read more!
If Biden wasn’t to old and senile to take some questions at a press conference then I’m sure it would be a disaster.  At least our president has the fortitude to take tough questions.  Hiding Biden... that’s your campaign.
Wow, keep going with the misgendering. Really making you look good here.  If you arent convinced by looking at Biden's record that he's shit and won't do anything then all I can say is you are willfully ignorant.
I speak the truth about Biden
And you are worried about Biden ???  "You know I moved on her... I did try and fuck her... She was married, I moved on her like a bitch... I just start kissing them, it’s like a magnet... And when you’re a star, they let you do it... Grab ’em by the pussy... You can do anything."
Joe Biden not taking questions from reporters in his second joint appearance alongside Kamala Harris is a good sign, right?
They work as little as Joe Biden does.
Biden and Harris absolutely do not have that
I have seen two Biden signs in my neighborhood. Gross
Its CRAZY  how people associate our race to the Democrat Party to the point you can be called a "sell out" mental slavery. Smh. Then get mad when Biden call us OBN. Lol
Lol you want a woman who thought the Vice President was touching other woman, a woman who called Biden a racist is that it?  Not everyone is crazy
Really? You cant decipher that? Or are you just deflecting because it's true?  Biden won't do shit for anyone or the environment. Why? Because his policy record says so.
That would make sense if Biden was chicken and not just shit without the glass.
The “Vote by Mail” riots are probably going to backfire for team Biden. But, we will see. 🍿 #Velshi #SaturdayMorning
If you believe Biden will do anything progressive thats on his policy platform, I have news for you.  You have been duped.
There’s two major scenarios right now:  1. Everyone votes, Biden or Trump becomes president 2. Not everyone votes, Biden or Trump becomes president  If your goal is to get people to break free of voting for Biden, you need to present a clear, well-planned third scenario
Hey  and  how about videos about grandpa &amp; grandma not getting meds bc the Fuhrer has shut down the postal service. Akin to that MAGA ad where a bad guy is breaking into granny’s house &amp; she calls 911 but Biden has abolished police.
The Postal carriers union endorses Biden, and they never killed anybody for a traffic violation.
#kag2020 or else we are screwed. Biden can no longer hold his bowels.
Thats w weird thing to say. Your saying what he will do, but really eon't, to get you through your day.  I look at the reality of Joe Biden
Clinton won the popular vote in 2016.  Even if Biden/Harris win in 2020, 35%-45% will have voted against them.  Plans for picking up the pieces in 2021 need to include: 1) why they voted for tRump 2) healing for their anger 3) how did they get so broken? Selfishness hurts us all.
Maybe because the VP candidate has A LITTLE to do about USA and president candidate has any economic plan. Now, K.H. has a big platform about Human Rights IN INDIA  where an awful caste system condems human beings to be "untouchable", less than animals!
There's one three-word reason why it's absolutely critical to vote for Joe Biden:  Ruth.  Bader.  Ginsburg.
Imagine what a failed existence you would have to lead to want to join a club that is led by Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden

China wants Biden to be your president.
it reaches back to Obama whose administration built the camps and Joe Biden, who wrote the legislation that created the agency and I refuse to let that go unstated
I would swim through a Coronavirus River of shit and piss to cast my vote for Biden. The thwarting of our free election from the right is only energizing the left. Come Nov. 5 all 3 branches will be held by the Dems. Get ready for the blue tsunami.
Two clear agendas for this deal: (1) Beef up the anti-Iran coalition (2) More USC arms sales to UAE  Notice that #Biden and the European leaders are already on board. Without a major shift in the political discourse in US on Israel, peace will not come to the Middle East #BDS
Kamala Harris is the most recent of a long line of Black heroines, write Ella Bell Smith and Connie Hale.   "We [see in] Harris an example of qualities that research tells us are prerequisites for all successful female leaders: grit, influence and grace."

irrelevant. quoting cornel here: “vote for biden but don’t lie about who he really is” - that’s the fucking point!
Enough excuses already.  Biden needs to start taking questions from reporters.  It’s making him look weak to continue to avoid them.
Do you see legal remedies? What laws have been broken? Surely this is illegal. My thought is that DeJoy - and perhaps the USPS Board of Governors - should know these actions may well merit jail time, and that should Biden win they won't have Trump to pardon them.
You wanted to say Joe Biden Can't unify the American people because he spent his life stealing money from us.
Love that joe Biden stutters as I do too and it didn’t end up holding me back neither. Go stuttering joe!
The most important thing a Biden presidency will do is return democracy to America.  That's your choice people: #TrumporAmerica
Biden doesn’t lie like you do.  If you lie you deserve to be called out and don’t deserve the respect that the presidency should have.

Biden's VP pick makes history, but not much sense
Right! When people refer to Joe Biden's "campaign" it's in the loosest terms. These people have no vision and just are locking Biden away and hoping Trump self destructs.
It's Harris/Biden ticket not Biden/Harris
To win the general, you need help and support getting it the vote  in swing states, not people in navy blue states whining about how much  you suck online. So no, Biden will not owe you or be accountable to you after the election. Just how it works.
Because Trump ALWAYS LIES AND CHEATS. Biden is a man of honor and integrity....and he genuinely cares about others. I am a Republican and hope you spend the rest of your life in jail and eternity down below.
Keep reading stories criticizing Biden's stump presence, which build on Trump's efforts to tear him down. We continue to elect people on likability or camera performance and not on ability to get things done. The flaws in that method ought to be blindingly obvious now.
That's one outcome that could happen but I think it's more likely Biden will shock the world and lose
"Biden ... [is ready to] acknowledge that the debt this country owes is not just to the rich white men who launched the American experiment," writes Eileen McNamara.   A woman of color on the Democratic ticket has been a long time coming.
Biden/Harris “around in circles”
And DeJoy should know that if Biden prevails he'll have no one to save his sorry ass. The  Board of Governors should be put on notice too.
Senator Ron Johnson and Rudy Giuliani to name two. Maybe Jared. All  of these cucarachas who enable this interference and cyber crime by foreign actors including Russia better hope that Biden doesn’t win. I guess that’s why they are trying to suppress the vote.
Why doesn't Pirro go on a bike ride with Biden? Let's see if she can keep up.

I keep hearing how Kamala has energized Joe’s campaign...   That makes me so happy.   Joe Biden is as good as it gets.

Another sign of how ineffective he's been at attacking Biden.
biden needs to win bc a speed run of the disappointment of obama all over again would help “the left” recruit more than just 4 more trump years
it’s insane to reject the fact that 4 more years of trump simply mean 4 more years of what we have now.  how’s that even a discussion?   you’re “assuming” to know what’s going to happen under biden - but you keep rejecting to acknowledge what a second trump tenure means for us?

I’m not very enthusiastic about Joke Biden as president. I am, however, looking forward to Harris in regard to real police reform. Back in the 90s cops hated Janet Reno. Harris will make Reno look like J Edgar Hoover.   #BlueLivesMafia #CopsLie #CriminalCops #DefundPolice

y’all being pimped out by the dnc talking bout “vote blue no matter who” “settle for biden” ..... it’s.... it’s fascism love

NY Police Union..Are you sure on Trumps Endorsement?? He's under Criminal investigation by Manhattan DA Cy Vance..Big mistake!
If I wanted to drink myself into a coma, I'll rewatch Biden announcing Susan Rice

Why Biden might follow Trump's hardline policy on China
I believe you will keep our SSA on, I’m disabled, and with Trump threats about cutting our pension or supplement we live a very miserable live. Trump eliminated many disabled benefits like transportation, or special treatments. I m a witness of all that. Biden 2020👌👏❤️
South Asians for Biden Launches ‘Indians for Biden National Council’ ln Wake of Historic Biden-Harris Ticket
Before Super Tuesday I'd have believed Warren could win here, but not Biden. Exit polls were all way off. I will go to my grave thinking something was rotten about it.
No...the Texas Democrats are going to be pissed because they're working their asses off. Can I ask WTF you problem is here? Beto has been on every damn station speaking up for Biden. Candidates aren't necessarily the same as the DNC.
Coffin Joe would also be a good nickname for Joe Biden.
&amp; Biden is a paradigm of virtue?  The one thing that Trump is not &amp; Biden is ... is stupid.   Stupid people who think they’re smart are dangerous.
Insanity is:  Joe Biden is actually running for president and people think its all good.  We live in a very sick country and if the haters have their way, we are finished.
They really seem to have thought they were going to run against Bernie and whoever he chose as VP and they couldn't figure out how to retune for Biden.
It’s very painful &amp; has been extremely depressing to watch I think Bernie’s whole thinking is Trump is way worse &amp; doesn’t want any blame,he’s said from day 1 he would support the nom But everyone else just lalaing not fighting or pushing Biden on anything really pisses one off
If Biden and Harris are too weak to take questions and too fragile to be subject to scrutiny, how are we to believe that they can handle the pressures of the presidency?
Where is the immigration rhetoric?! Where are Hillary’s Benghazi?!? You played Biden’s  Burisma ties prematurely and idiotically and ended up impeached for your trouble! The pandemic wiped away your economy achievements, and it even brought your Obama vendetta back to haunt you!
Your absolutely right we would be looking at twice the amount of deaths. As Biden thought it was a bad idea to restrict flights in to the United States.

"A Biden-Harris team knows how the levers of Washington work," writes Eileen McNamara, "and will engage them in the restoration of a democracy brought to the brink of collapse by the feckless leadership of a corrupt would-be autocrat."
Unsure why is there a pic of #alextrebek on this Biden profile
Same old thoughtless regurgitation of old talking points. Speak of "privilege" to an Anti-war voter? Smh  A Biden Foreign Policy ala Iraq, Libya, Syria, Honduras (already has eyes on forcibly returning Venezuela to the Petrodollar) will hurt far more people than both Trump terms.
Biden was installed as nominee specifically to keep Americans from getting healthcare and other such humane reforms. Imagine what kind of sellout creep you have to be to facilitate that.
Is it the Donald Trump or the mother fucking Americans who voted for him .He don't give a f about me &amp; you .He only cares about him &amp; his ratings .Americans should wake up now &amp; Vote for Biden/ Harris coalitions..
Where do you live? If it's anything other than a swing state your vote won't matter so do what you want I am in MA, Biden will get 70% so my vote has no consequence Don't like Biden that much either so will vote for 1 of the other 2  If I was in a swing state I'd vote Biden

Can you make sleepy Joe’s Café Biden’s campaign song? You could rewrite the lyrics in a anti-trump theme 😎🎸
Biden/Harris are definitely not perfect but they are a billion fold better than Trump, his nepotism, and overall fascist behaviour that undermines the rights of our citizens. I can at least feel safe in knowing that Biden won't try to inhibit citizen votes in elections.
Biden’s delivery wasn’t great but chaining ourselves to mailboxes isn’t the worst idea.
old folks liked Biden
I have a friend who is full Brocialist and proclaims daily she will not vote Biden because of ... reasons.  🙄  She's on disability due to a debilitating genetic disorder. She will be greatly hurt by a second Trump term. She refuses to vote to protect herself.
In the hands of the people who love doing it.   (Sanders)  (warren)  (Biden) ... I'm missing a lot but comedians may have a hit but not a consistent program
Trump is very annoying. Calls Biden dumb. Trump’s education is very lagging. He projects what he isn’t on others. He talks like a first grader. He lies and forgets he just lied in a few seconds. Any person with real brains will reflect.
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews DemocRATS starting to infight. The whole DemocRAT Party is one big smelly dumpster fire.
Dude even CNN is getting pissed that Biden won’t answer questions from reporters.  Also Chris Wallace was livid today about it.
#LoserInChief  #BidenHarris2020 is coming for you! All your distractions &amp; lies won’t help! Can’t wait to see Biden kick your ass in the debate! 👏
Whether Biden win or not this cycle is a total loss, it didn't need to be but having zero influence on VP &amp; cabinet picks means this cycle is a total loss.  The focus is now on the next cycle.

Know any former Attorneys from SDNY who would be interested in the job as AG in a Biden administration??? Just curious...

Yes ... you’re right. Trump has put up the fence and wall. He’s a disgrace! Biden will have it all removed.
Kamala Harris Says Joe Biden Broke One Of 'Most Substantial Barriers' In US By Choosing Her As Running Mate
my mom said I could go to my friend’s baby shower! so now I’ve gotta think of advice to write down but since I’m not a mom all I can think of is “don’t have kids” or “vote for biden so maybe the pandemic ends here someday and your kid can go to daycare/school”
Honestly, the Biden Ryan 2012 debate might have made the difference.
I urge you to vote in person for Biden/Harris on November 3rd if you can safely  If you cannot please fill in a ballot and send it in immediately   #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
America thinks otherwise.  See
Trump and Pence seen more as “losers.”  See

What is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's plan for black folks
The Democrats including Biden abused powers and spied on President Trump &amp; abused FISA courts. They committed treason and this is who you support? Praying for you🙏
Joe Biden said you nat black if you dont vote for him and I guess massa was right huh..what are they doing for black people..what's their plan
please send Joe Biden my best wishes
Sounds like Joe Biden.
No. You are wrong. Check your ego and wake up. Look at the criminal behavior being uncovered on the Democrats and FBI to unlawfully spy! That was on Biden's watch!
lmao Biden literally said we need an unending stream of non-white immigration so that whites become an absolute minority because that's the source of our strength. That's a quote.
Joe Biden teabags CUMALOT Harris
This paragraph is something. "You're supposed to hook up your brain to the to the boss's, not act independently!" Yeah, let's go for government as a giant technocratic hive-mind. No one who thinks that way is sharing a brain with Obama. He's didn't pick Biden by accident.
The biggest difference for anyone with a soul and the ability to empathize is the 150,000 Americans and counting, who have died in the last 6 months due to Trumps failure to lead.   They cannot vote, but the rest of us will speak for them, mail or no mail.  #Biden
No self respecting Republican would get behind far left Sen Kamala Harris/Biden ticket.
and BOY are a lot of postal workers switching their allegiances to Biden through all this! That's been the only fun part to watch happen in real time.
Fucking bite on this idiots.. Paybacks are a bitch..You fuck over the USPS.. Your gonna pay now..  USPS workers union endorses Biden, citing threat to postal service "survival"
Biden is an incompetent idiot who's not even fit to be a door greeter bc he would grope,grab or sexually assault women&amp;children. He's plagiarized other ppl's speeches&amp;writings. He's mentally unfit,period!! Insults Black ppl&amp;even called them N**gg**s!!
But of course I’m voting for Biden. Every election since 2000 has been too historic and important to consider a principled stand.

If they were endorsing Biden, you would be "heels up" for them!!
Let’s definitely talk about that when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win the election on Nov. 3rd.  See
once voted into office, fascism is not something that can be voted out. Biden might very well lose, and lose badly. be ready for that this time.
And I think this is pretty much a temperamental/intellectual thing determined at birth. Obama's bandwidth gets used up by his high resolution view of things, and he can't help it. His irritation isn't personal, and he probably buoyed himself on Biden's energy more often than not.
Being very vocal about voting for Joe Biden so all of the men in my life know I’m willing to settle

Biden delivers scathing address on Trump, and the president fires back  via
Exactly. I think Biden does better as a middleman than as an executive, but he's a genius at this part. Statesmen are those who both see the big picture and enjoy people in general, and who know how to harmonize the two.
The best we as a country could come up with was Trump and Biden. Really?

i’ve gone over the fact that i’m in one of the many safe states, which means my vote for biden would not have any effect on trump’s re-election, just as my vote for hillary had no effect from MA.Isn't this what Biden tried to do? Except this is holding workers hostage for s political agenda,pretty sure it's a crime.
When Dems&amp;Obama back a clueless Biden,it makes them look incredibly stupid for starters,Biden can't remember which state he's in,he thinks all Blacks think alike for crying out loud! Then he tells them they're not Black enough if they don't vote for him!
Oh, absolutely. CAP senior staff will all almost certainly have high ranking posts in the Office of Making Sure Medicare For All Never Happens in the Biden admin so probably the most helpful thing they could do is just stay mum for the duration but I don’t see that happening
We're lucky to have groups like    working to help ensure more people vote for Biden.  They're MUCH better at creating honest, smart, &amp; hard-hitting pieces than the Dems are 🤦🏼‍♂️.
I haven’t decided how I’m gonna vote yet (changed my mind from hard no vote to lean no vote). But a lot of people who dedicate their lives to the unglamourous social justice/poverty work are sitting this one out- and if Biden/Harris fail to convince them otherwise, that’s on them
Thank you!!! Delta Zetas are similar and I’ll continue to wear my colors. I love Senator Harris and I volunteer everyday for her and Joe Biden. Love them. I appreciate her Greek sorority background no doubt. 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻

Obama Expresses Concerns That Biden Cannot Defeat Trump, Report - Conservative Brief
I just wanna be clear-Joe Biden could literally try to murder me and I would find a way to roll my comatose ass to the polls and vote for him on November 3rd.
Honest question; not criticizing or arguing: If the police unions had endorsed Biden, would we be having this conversation?  Note: I am *absolutely* voting for Biden 🇺🇸.
...and the  are in goosestep with the tyrant Trump. I’ll go with Biden thank you very much.
Prediction: if Biden gets elected (or if Trump doesn’t completely sabotage our election system), we are in for a run of 3–4 one-term presidents, each of whom runs on a “change” platform, and each of whom will be impeached at some point during that one term.
Done!  Thanks for the recommendation.
I’ll drive down from Boston with a car full of Biden/Harris signs
THIS IS REAL  There will be no #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 because there is no way Biden will get through the campaign without severals giant gaffes in the debates
If Biden wins—which i seriously doubt—his legacy will be pulling back the country from the brink of fascism. He doesn’t need much more of one than that.
the only people with anything nice to say about Biden, or credit him with any political acumen at all, are the republicans who steamrolled the Obama administration for 8 years
Sounds like she might be Biden’s Secretary of State or defense
You lost 300,000 votes last night. 300,000 votea for Joe Biden!. usps carriers and more..So F you! You screw with. the usps you get it taken away from you-! You loose!

Do I really need to list the issues of Hunter Biden?
I like that the Ed Markey video has a very brief bit acknowledging taking out Trump means moving on to fight Biden after.
Who cares? The Democrats conceded when they picked Biden. Everything after that is performance art. The campaign is stillborn but they’re carrying it to term anyway. That at least might get some Republican voter goodwill in a later election.
HUNTER BIDEN. Need I say more?  It sure seems like your defending/justifying someone who stole 1/2 million from a charity, just because she’s a woman.
It must have been really dumb because you don't look smart.  Anyone excited about Biden is not too smart. He was in office 45 years and all he did was put blacks in prison with his marijuana laws of the 80s he authored and his crime bill in 94. White old man dumb as a stump.
Do you know what Donald..All your garbage your spewing out..voter supression usps mail in ballots..Americans aren't stupid..your BS only fires up voters to vote Biden and stand there and watch you crash and burn on November 3rd.. Your so low and desperate.sad

It’s an insult that Biden and Harris think women will vote their way simply because a woman is running.  That’s pretty much saying you have no brain to vote for your own thoughts and opinions about intelligent topics.
Well unfortunately now, Biden incapable of simply answering questions. Maybe that man on the pic was, but that is not the man that is running for President.
Private prisons are an injustice.  To imply that Biden/Harris will support and/or enable them more than Trump/Pence is just disingenuous tho
Why are you attacking that ticket?  It’s a binary choice at this point: Biden or Trump.  To attack the Biden ticket is to support the Trump one

Big deal! With the things she has said about the POTUS why should we care? I happen to think she is as phony as the day is long. Her fake cackling laugh is enough to make  me want to throw something at my tv. I think she’s irritating and obnoxious just like Biden is.

I’m not a conspiracy theorist by any means but...what if Biden wins, resigns for health concerns, and Harris becomes not only the first woman, but the first black woman as President. President Harris has a nice ring to it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Honestly, I'm a little relieved it's over. I don't care about Harris. I don't care about Biden. But at least we don't have to listen to that brand of horse race shit for a while
Get over it.. You have lost every voter.. Biden and Harris will take over now..You already killed your base in those 163,000 americans.. Cyrus Vance is coming for you and Michael Flynn is going back to prison..Your golf clubs are calling ya
Hm, I actually think (being in a state Biden will lay zero attention to) that the best thing I can do is strategically withhold my vote. If Biden loses MA by a little less then expected, maybe he will be more inclined to take us seriously

Kamala Harris was a former #1 contender for dem candidates I would consider drinking with. She fell out down in the polls when she dropped out.   Biden was never even in the running because I strongly dislike him - and I really like alcohol -  so that’s saying a lot.
Wrong choice. Shows lots about the pathetic state that Biden is in &amp; how the Dems are just wrong again.   The move was to the middle w/ the choice knowing cabinet would be left reaching and VP really the play caller.   Good luck winning over moderates on both sides w/ more crazy!

Not gonna vote for a prosecutor who covered for a corrupt drug lab. Just not gonna do it. And I’m in Massachusetts, so Biden doesn’t care anyway

Doubling down on my conspiracy theory that Harris got permission from the Biden campaign to do the one attack on Biden the entire primary.
is the Biden campaign ever going to pivot to the general?
Katie Porter for US Senate?  *provided Biden &amp; Harris win

Should we set Biden's VP-pick horse slightly ahead of the Trump/Biden horses?
In other words, the same reason McCain lost. He was a great candidate but picked a terrible running mate. (It didn’t help that he was running against Obama, who was an excellent candidate and knew how to create buzz in a way that Trump does and Biden doesn’t.)

You know we're in troubling times when specific genitalia is one of the required attributes for which a VP mate is to be selected... Utter shame Mr Biden
Biden/Harris I hope
4 year olds can ride a bike, that doesn’t make him fit for President. Biden will destroy this country.  Just look at the Dem run cities. That will be everywhere with him in charge.

And now I know why they called you meathead! The North won at Gettysburg but you keep supporting Joe Biden who was friends with an actual KKK member in Robert Byrd.

Mr. Biden is hoping she’ll throw up one of his lawn signs.
Sources have told me that the Joe Biden’s VP pick will be...  Announced before November 3rd.
Yes and no. Biden has said he will only serve one term. I think it’s important that he picks a VP that is strong enough to run a winning campaign in 2024.

I never said Biden was on Epstein’s Island did I?? No I didn’t, I don’t go around call people a pedophile on a public forum without proof.
“EVERYBODY” should CARE! Something happens to Biden who do you think becomes president?! The VP should be chosen by “QUALIFICATIONS” NOT what “COLOR” their skin is!
Hmmm,  now I’m thinking Biden really might be able to do more push ups than me and probably take me out back and beat me up.  Stop the presses because this changes everything.
Can you imagine the rating these debates are going to get.  It’s going to be like a Super Bowl event.  Trump being the favorite and for many the first time seeing Biden’s sad condition.  The dems may try and replace him after the first debate if necessary and who could blame them
Biden literally got the idea to use the Logan Act from the show “West Wing”.  Also copies speeches from the show !!!
As a libertarian I voted for Trump in 2016 not because he was my first choice but because anyone was better than HRC. I preferred Rand Paul and would have been happy with Christie, Jeb and even Kasich but that was then. Now no way and I going with Trump or Biden. Nobody 2020
This is without release of Durham's report/indictments &amp; requires Biden to hold up in his basement. Best never to discount the power of incumbency. If Trump champions pot legalization, suddenly favors M4All and brings troops home, coupled with an October surprise? Things change.
Remember this you oblivious tree trunk.. Seniors will sharply remember you are doing your best to remove their lifeline..Social Security and Medicare.. Joe Biden won't . Seniors/disabled know what your up to now/ tax cuts/ defund SSA.  They will remove U Nov 3
Get over it.. Your toast..Can't wait for Biden to end the NRA and bring gun control..No one needs a AK 47 to hunt with.. End sales of all automatic and semi automatic guns..Your gun smoke days are over..
Eagerly awaiting a Biden presidency! If I want to send a real, paper, USPSletter to JB after the election, where should it go? HQ in Philly?
Joe Biden makes him look really good.
If it makes you feel better, my contractor just explained to me how Biden and Hillary used Chinese money in Minneapolis to organize George Floyd’s murder
Now you sound like Biden.
You realize Biden,along with Obama ,set policies that hurt America? Trump 2020
I live in corporate leftville and I haven’t seen a single Biden sign that’s how bad a candidate Biden is
I LOVE the 2008 SNL stuff!! Especially the Sarah Palin/Joe Biden debate!!
Yea but joe Biden is perfectly nothing mentally wrong with him
How adorable of you to think I support Biden either. And how very conservative of you to be so black and white as it’s the simplest way to think.
Keep an eye open for reports of secret service assuming protection of one of the women reportedly under consideration for Biden's VP.  That could be a big indicator.  It was how people started to figure out Biden was the pick in '08.
Hopefully Biden/Harris
Our lives depend on itvVote Biden Harris and blue tip to toe
Trump no where near the hilarious and bumbling Joe Biden for lies and gaffs. Biden lies 24/7 but Democrats excuse his lying. smh......
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump  via
No; but will be an equal disaster when Biden wins for different reasons. Sad state of affairs we are in.
I am expecting Pete to have a substantial role in the convention. Joe had much personal praise for Pete when he endorsed Biden, and said Pete would be in his administration. Pete and Chasten have been very active for and with Joe and Jill Biden, and #TeamPete has been there too.
It's not about #Coronavirus it has everything to do with his mental capacity! He can no longer have a coherent conversation. He has so many outbursts&amp;confusion. He can not read notes put in front of him. Dems should be charged for #ElderlyAbuse #BidenUnfit
You are not worthy of any vote. Black, Brown, White or otherwise. Biden will hurt GOD? God , like everybody else does not like a liar. You are the king of prevarication.
Idk about Biden’s church regularity, but the second sentence is true.
Spell check ,you knew who I meant. The woman joe Biden molested. Who told her mom and friends when it happened.
But you still support Biden?
He will make a big mistake. The wackos will vote Biden. Biden is just a puppet. Need a strong VP. The inmates will run the assylum. Its pathetic I have to vote for Biden but the country will just go into reverse and go in another absolute horrible direction.
One of the other freaken readons your not getting elected again because you shit on americans..Oh you and Ron Johnsons and Lindsey Grahams and your beloved Putin are not denigrating Biden..More conspiracy with a foriegn advisary to rig an election... Sorry we know.Remove You!
RESIGN OR WE WILL REMOVE YOU. YOUR CHOICE. YOU AND  we will stop you asap. Your not doing nothing with the Russians to denigrate Joe Biden. This is Our democracy..Our Election. Not Russias. Clear enough for you Mr.Johnson?? Back off!
Intelligence officials provide details on Russian disinformation campaign against Biden: report -
You think you and the Russians  and Ron Johnson are attempting to denigrate Joe Biden..Be careful..Americans know what your doing.. Not happening. This is not 2016.
You are 100% in the wrong of using religion as a prop for your pathetic re-election attempts against Joe Biden. It will fire back and make you as desperate as a snake crossing over a 4 lane highway getting to the other side safely. HUGE MISTAKE.
Can they elect literally anyone? Biden is only up 3 nationwide in a couple recent polls and that was BEFORE he went on his ramblings about cocaine and elephants.
This election seems less about representing the “right” positions, more who gets to them “first” and markets better. Biden wants to open schools, but Americans (by &amp; large) associate Trump with “OPEN THE SCHOOLS”. Trump says “MASKS” but we mostly associate Dems with that message.
He took the cognitive test&amp;passed!! Biden has yet to take it. BTW  IQ is one of the highest of all POTUS' to date. #Facts Matter Biden thinks Blacks ain't Black if they vote other tan Democrat. Biden also thinks Blacks all think the same. No problem there? GTHO!!
Biden's brain is drained of any&amp;all logical thinking,no problem solving abilities left!! Dem leaders should be charged for elderly abuse!!
Have you considered doing some funny lip synching videos to Joe Biden lines to draw attention to the humour of the situation?
Georgia and Texas are a toss up not because of Biden or the "president." They are a toss up because Black and Latinx folks have been working their ass off to build progressive infrastructure for a decade.     Let's make sure no one ever forgets that.“if Biden wins in November, he and the party will inherit a set of emergencies unlike anything seen since the days of the Great Depression or before”
Her constituents voted for Joe Biden -- by like 30%, iirc -- in the MI primary.
biden could endorse m4a
Should he not have used drone strikes to kill terrorist? Lets not forget he took out 22 of the top 25 leaders in a Al-Qaeda. What should he have done differently? He also voted against the Iraq war so lets not forget that. As for Biden that bum has never seen a war he didn't love
how is it my fault biden would veto m4a?
There is no way we could here in MA- they would really damage our home. But they can put Biden signs up? The hypocrisy is astounding
With all that is happening to the country, Wisconsin must be so proud that their senator is devoting all his effort to investigating what Hunter Biden did two years ago.
I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
I know.  She should make the list.  She'll be their biggest draw outside of Obama, Biden, and Harris.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris looked pretty good in their matching navy blue masks on Wednesday.
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn’t have ‘a Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
are you morons plugged in?.... trump?... LMFHAO... itll b Biden in a landslide and people will remember this shit
therefore cannot be equated with “helping trump” despite all the propaganda surrounding it.   liberals want anything anti biden to be pro-trump, so that way you aren’t allowed to be anti-biden (or anti-democrat) which is v fascist imo.   now you know, please don’t play into this.
such as my state, massachusetts, where biden will win by 30% of the vote.  most states are like this.  only a handful are “swing states” where there’s a chance the state flips.  because my state is decided, not supporting biden has zero effect on the election outcome and -
in the usa, presidential election is decided by counting up electoral votes, which are assigned by states’ winners.  so whoever wins my state, (biden) gets all 12 electoral votes.  then whoever hits 270 first wins.   at least 40 out of 50 states are very much decided...
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.  If someone offers you a choice between chicken or a pile of shit with broken glass in it, you don’t ask how the chicken has been prepared.  If you can’t do the BEST thing, do the thing that sucks the least.
When a vaccine is available I want to see footage of every famous person getting poked in the arm, a full-court press across traditional and social media. Justin Timberlake, Oprah, Biden, Trump, Derek Jeter, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Grover, Laverne Cox, Beyoncé, Judi Dench…
So should Joe Biden and Donald Trump
Biden should do whatever works to get elected. He doesn’t owe you anything.  He’s been in the public view his entire adult life. People know what he’s about. And they know Trump is a criminal and a lazy moron to boot.
Biden should do whatever helps him win. Plenty of time for pressers once elected
Agree but Trump rarely answers tough questions.  He sidesteps them, swats them away, berates reporters who asks questions he's uncomfortable answering, etc.  So until Trump starts "answering" questions, then Biden doesn't need to hold weekly press conferences.
Why doesn't Pirro go on a bike ride with Biden? Let's see if she can keep up.

Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden  👍
For me, it’s no contest.  Trump is an outright criminal.  That evil far outweighs any flaws with Biden.
"Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment'...Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television"
From my  piece earlier this year — has Biden answered this problem by making Harris one of “Our Own?”
If Dems win, they will choose to "look forward, not back." Biden will continue most of the same policies, normalizing them. Trump will say something mildly critical of the next GOP fascist to be "elected" and be hailed as a part of the #Resistance.  If the US makes it that far.
Anyone who gets the Democratic Party knew Bloomberg was irrelevant:  If Bernie (or someone else not named Biden) won SC, (s/)he was going to be the nominee.  If Biden won SC -- even by 1% -- he was the best candidate to take on Bernie.
I said since the summer that Bernie/Warren/Amy/Pete would have to get at least 25-30% in SC to have a viable path to the nomination.  I said in the fall Biden getting 50-60% in SC would make IA/NH/NV irrelevant.  Glad I was right.

my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Thanks Brooke!  Please stay strong Sen. Harris of OAKLAND, CA!  We need you and Joe Biden now more than ever!
I will commit to phone banking for biden if he bans pod save america from all streaming platforms
If "common sense" means abandoning attempts to finish sentences and "compassion" means playing a major role in almost every bad policy decision made by the US since the 70's, then, yeah, i guess vote biden??
Vice President Biden was being a true leader unlike someone who thinks the virus will magically go away.
somehow your twitter bio rings hollow. “I’m not GOP or Dem” followed by Harris/Biden 2020. Yeah, you’re right down the middle...Lol
Or let me spell things out a little clearer. It doesn’t even matter if Biden is senile from your deductions based on media clips (clearly scientific..). The decisions made in the Oval Office is already senile. So it’s a moot point. But I hope you find your solace in the debates.
This year’s election could lead to a significant change in the capital-gains tax rate—no matter who wins   via
Melania’s speech very clearly used Michelle’s as a template after some minor editing. Joe Biden used a similar metaphor to the one Reagan used, but his speech wasn’t based on Reagan’s. Can you see the difference through your partisan bias?
Vote Biden/Harris. They may not be your ideal ticket, but Trump is a disaster who will so much worse in 4 more years and no re-election to worry about
Not covering the fact that both Biden and Reagan used the word “possibilities”? Oh heavens no!
It was more than a cliché, mate. That describes Biden calling America a land of possibilities, not the whole sentences Melania ripped off.
Melania stole entire sentences from Michelle, Mary. Biden just used the word “possibilities.”
Melania’s speech did indeed steal entire sentences from Michelle Obama, unlike this non-story about Reagan and Biden both using the word “possibilities.”
Lord forgive me but I made a Steamed Hams for Biden/Harris ticket
Biden and Harris will know how to handle a pandemic, saving countless lives. Over 165K dead because of Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.  Now he wants to rig the election again by defunding the USPS
WSJ Opinion: A Biden Presidency Won't Help Black School Children
I heard not only will Biden remove kids from cages but he will also be recycling those cages in order to build a bridge. And YOU can buy that bridge, DM for details
Per the CNN exit poll, 56% of 2020 SC Primary voters were African-American.  Further, per the exit poll, Biden won 61% of black voters in the Palmetto State.
And to be fair. Biden will promise to fix NYC and then forget what NYC is!
I wish Biden were that cool
This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.
Probably still not going to vote for President, but I actually kind of like Kamala. She sucks on a bunch of stuff, but on the whole she is better than anyone (except maybe Gore) who has ever been on the Democratic ticket. Maybe Biden will wander off into the woods or something
Ummm, no.  Like Bernie, Joe Biden came in to the nomination with a base.  Now you may not see them, because they’re darker (and older) ...
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
But once I saw this video after IA, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination:
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
Congratulations America, we’ve made safely sending kids back to school a partisan issue. 75% of Rs think students returning to school is a good idea, 83% of Ds say it is a bad idea.
No silly! Biden’s in his basement!
Leadership is not plagiarizing speeches...  Reagan Speechwriter: Biden Just Plagiarized From Reagan
Trump accused Biden of ignoring science on coronavirus - New York Daily News.    Hahahahaha HAHAHAHAHA
This is leadership 😂 Biden: "I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool &amp; rub my leg down so it was straight &amp; watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap..."
Hysterically funny that Trump lies about following the science. He is so obviously ignorant of science ie drink Lysol to kill the virus. Most children cleaning fluids are poisonous!  Biden &amp; Harris are intelligent solid people who can follow science &amp; have common sense!
The world laughs right now at Trump as the bully clown failing to lead the USA.  Biden will rebuild the respect America always had before the Trump Administration!
I mean... Biden's no Socialist yet he likes to get publicly owned with his asinine statements so...
Sounds like music 🎶, isn’t Biden? Biden ? Biden ... ah you can’t hear me you’re in the basement 😜
You assume I would vote for Biden if Hawkins weren't on the ballot. You're wrong. Go recruit non-voters if you think your case is so strong. I'm always voting to the left because that's the best way to pressure the system and strengthen our movement.
As someone else recently put it, any progressive action will be organized around, over, under, or careening through a Biden Administration, but it will not be coming from, by, or with a Biden Administration. At best, they will do *slightly* less to actively impede &amp; detain us.
The important thing to understand about a potential Biden Administration is that progressives or leftists of any kind and tendency will not be running it, will not be co-running it, will not be a junior partner in it, will for all intents &amp; purposes not be part of it.
Biden/Harris raised almost as much money in 48 hours as Biden did in all of 2019, $59 million.
Dear  You can turn the mail sorters back on. Your country is counting on you. Our future depends on it.
Bernie, Warren, Biden, maybe Amy.  If you think those stories weren’t coming from the competition, you’re extremely naive.
Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
This is exactly the type of shit I’m talking about. And ironically, Kamala harrris DID separate children from their families as AG, Biden DID separate children and families at the border and biden DID send in federal enforcement to deal with protesters, using the same tear...
Unfortunately over 165K dead people because of your poor pandemic response won't be around for a Biden Presidency.

I always love these predictions. There is no way to refute them. You can’t be wrong. 10,000 people die, would have been 50,000. 60,000 die, would have been 100,000. As Biden says, it’s horse puckey.
It sounds like a conspiracy to violate citizens' civil rights. Stiff jail term if convicted. Biden/Harris and a bunch of people should say this publicly and often. Might intimidate some people out of helping.
Biden will make our country proud and a huge success again. You are the laughing stock around the world and have made our country a failure or you’re a failure more accurately.
Joe biden lost me at "I got a lotta - I got hairy legs that turn"

Harris may have perfected the craft of "advise and consent" with Justice Kavanaugh, but there is only one founder of "This Is Personal" style Senate hearings, the creator of Borking, Mr. Joe Biden.
Reality is every DNC has an ex-R as a speaker, and every RNC has an ex-D as a speaker.  So it is expected to have an ex-R as a prime time DNC speaker.  John Kasich has endorsed Joe Biden.  That's why Kasich makes sense as this year's R speaking at the DNC.
DNC rules are that you have to endorse the presumptive nominee to get a speaking slot.  See 1992:  Brown, Edmund G. and Casey, Robert P.  Beto has clearly endorsed Joe Biden.  Has AOC?

Fascism is winning regardless of whether Biden or Trump is in the White House. Stop compromising and start fighting back.
The GOP would literally pull a Pinochet than let Biden win by 12 points

We would be in a much stronger position if Greens forced the US government to show its hand, unlike Sanders who is busy sheepdogging progressives for Biden.
As an Indian American I was low key horrified that most Indian folks would vote for the Biden duo just based of race.
I mean all I can do is max out my donations to Biden and maybe do a little phone banking. I don't think I can meaningfully stop the worst from happening.
i would rather have bernie and covid-19 than biden and no pandemic
We’ve got the ticket. Now we need the votes. Everyone, it’s time to persuade voters and conquer the logistics so all voters can safely deliver #BidenHarris to victory. Together, we win
Biden could be in cognitive decline for 100 years and be more able than Trump

I'm trying to communicate with you. Science is the only thing that will show whether a vaccine works, but the idea of listening to trustworthy people like Joe Biden or Angela Merkel is not "pointing to more science".

If Joe Biden recommends a vaccine in December, will you still refuse it?
Suburban housecats for Biden!
Refusing a scientifically proven vaccine just because a moron happens to be in charge of the government is self-destructive. If Joe Biden recommends a vaccine in December will you still refuse to get it?
That's because elections tend to tighten before election day. If the election were held tomorrow with Biden up 8 points his chances would be in the 90s.
Interesting how people will criticize Kamala Harris to the ends of the earth but not at all to the extent of Joe Fricking Biden- the actual nominee who’s much more problematic than her...
and all this "we have to get behind Biden" is just a loyalty oath in different form
The "worst" political analysis I've heard is Trump talking about how effective he has been as president. Anyway, you have a point. The party overall has shifted left but the last two nominees have been quite conservative. Hillary over Bernie and Biden over Bernie, Liz etc
This result makes sense. Trump's voters are largely cultists who believe he "alone can fix it."  I'm voting for Biden, but I would have chosen "somewhat," because I'm sufficiently informed to know it will be difficult to thwart the pandemic now that it has spread so widely.

Biden's favorability number seems very inconsistent with the other findings. Any ideas why?
Biden would have for sure lost before the pandemic but now he has a chance.

I hope Harris helps prepare Biden for the debates. Need to be as sharp as possible. Trump supporters overlook the presidents flaws and focus on Biden’s.
I really hope #KamalaHarris can "diversify" Biden's discourse--especially his go-to line: "I will beat him like a drum." #BidenHarris2020

Biden: 'I've Selected Kamala Harris To Be Our Next President'  via
Personally, I think Harris was a bad choice for Biden although she will be a good and somewhat effective attack dog.  She panders way too much to the left for my taste.  We will see what voters think in November.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make their public debut today as running mates after she beat out 10 other finalists to become the first Black woman on a major-party presidential ticket   via
Correction: 4th woman.   I seem to remember that Hillary Clinton once "appeared" on a presidential ticket.
And Catholics will vote Biden
How is anyone actually voting for Biden/Harris?  C’mon.
Imagine how Trump would respond to a woman who publicly challenged and criticized him. Especially a strong, non-white woman.   Harris may be a pragmatic or political choice for Biden. But they’re already showing themselves to care less about their egos and more about the office.
Kamala Harris Is Biden’s Choice for Vice President  ALL RIGHT 👍
Biden should be getting intelligence briefings. Maybe he has to officially be named the nominee first.
Paul Tsongas won the primary in 1992, and Hillary Clinton won in 2008.  In both years the eventual Dem nominee carried the state in the general.   So, will Biden carry New Hampshire? He's up nine points based on 538's average and his margin is increasing.
I’m your target audience. I’m voting Biden and a straight dem ticket and will never vote GOP again.
Counterpoint: The Biden/Harris administration will be the most progressive in American history BECAUSE the  and  candidates we elect will make it the most progressive administration in history. Also, support progressives like
Fwiw, I volunteered in Biden's Quincy, MA office right before Super Tuesday.
After MS, AL was likely to be Biden's 2nd or 3rd best state overall (and one of Bernie's/Warren's/Pete's/Amy's 3-4 worst states).
Damn -- and Biden won by a bigger margin in VA than he did in SC.  53% in a 4-candidate race in VA is impressive when HRC and Obama won Old Dominion with 63-65% in a 2-candidate race.  Granted, after AL, VA was always going to be Biden's 2nd best Super Tuesday state.
JFC, smash twitter is so dense when it comes to politics. I cannot fathom why there are people seriously struggling with voting Trump out in 2020. Stop equating Biden and Trump as "Sexual Abusers". They're not remotely the same
Daily Poll: Do you approve Of Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as running mate?
Pence has to defend a racist, sexist president. Harris gets to talk about how that racism and sexism feel to a Black woman like her. This isn’t any ordinary clash of perspectives and philosophies. It’s an extraordinary collision of life experiences.
Biden is a very, very luck guy having you on board.
You should vote for Biden because he does admit fault, doesn’t speak in hyperboles, doesn’t keep changing the subject, listens to what others have to say, and doesn’t use ad-hominem attacks.  Also, because Obama wants him to win. #BidenHarris2020
The second tweet is a reply to the first. I don’t even know what to say 😂 she’s never gonna be Treasury Secretary in a Biden administration, that’s the whole point of a Biden administration

seriously, the man is evil. He's not incompetent, he's evil. George HW Bush was the definition of middling incompetence. This guy is corrupt. I wish GOP voters would just admit it, vote Biden, and recalibrate in 2024.
Yeah they tolerate Joe Biden poop and pee his pants everyday.  That's tolerance!
Biden doesn't even know who he is right now. He doesn't know he's running for president or white or a man or where he is at. He probably just pooped his pants again.
6-8 weeks puts us in October.... come November is the election... I am not huge conspiracy theorist but why do you say November... post election as in Biden wins and this goes away???
No one believes Biden is a racist, but everyone knows that Trump is one, bigly.
you’re assuming as if you know the intention of others. it’s his daughter, he clearly would never talk about his daughter like that. why are people so wicked and perverse with their thoughts? you would rather focus on that than biden actuslly touching little kids.
Is Fox threatening Biden????
Biden's handlers may have trumped Trump, but I don't think so.
You gave an outstanding speech today, Vice President Biden. You and Kamala are exactly what we need.
Yes. Let's do this. My only income is social security, Dr. Biden. I really cannot afford to donate, but I will shout to my last breath that Joe and Karmala need to kick that POtuS to the curb!
Biden/Harris 2020 feels like hope! Great first speeches from both.
This is such a crock!! Hearts and flowers all over this speech... Never heard such nonsense...Not only is Biden is a fraud but so is Kamala Harris!  #LetsGetReal #NoWay #TryTo
Rep. Cheney, this is a pretty good draft for a Biden/Harris campaign ad. Have you considered a career change?
Nahh Im watching Biden and Harris talk, you know, the next POTUS &amp;VPOTUS
538 Forecast is out. And, sure, Biden is favored to win (now), but check out the tipping point states. Shit is razor-thin.
Biden names VP and just like that people realize he wont be defunding the police either and is just as anti minority as the cheeto... Jorgensen 2020 for real change
Too many people still support him. They need to see the juxtaposition and quash the narrative that Biden is not there cognitively. As insane as it is, I personally know people with reservations about Trump who buy it (I know, I know).
You would have used this exact same line against any VP choice. Biden/Harris will being stability, intgrity, and intelligence, the exact opposite of the current chaos. Let's right the ship.
lol...so, I wrote this "quick" thread about folks who get, rightly, annoyed whenever they get accused of "loving Trump" whenever they criticize Biden or Harris or Democrats. But, after 7 tweets, I was like "what the hell...this is too much."
The difference between Trump/Pence and Biden/Harris couldn’t be more pronounced. One side is all about lies and corruption, the other is about ethics, intelligence, experts, the truth  and a soul.
Perhaps read some Howard Zinn. People movements are a key driver to getting the policy we want. It works better with good politicians and Harris/Biden are good. So this is how it works. Don’t like it, donate to your own cause. I’m not stopping and Twitter downtown so much either
Biden and Harris have a heart and a soul. Trump and Pence have ice water running through their veins, and no semblance of a soul.
I am so proud of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. We are lucky to have these two, who will bring back decency, honor, ethics,respectability, knowledge, intelligence, truthfulness, equality &amp; class back to the White House. In the age of Trump, these two are like a breath of fresh air.
Gee, someone is very afraid of the Biden/Harris ticket and you know what- he should be!
This is what a president says and does. Thank you Joe Biden. We need you more than ever!
Ok... but can someone else accept the nomination??  I won't vote for Biden if you don't run again...
Trump says the stock market will tank if Biden is elected. Of course - Trump has been buying up stock like crazy to artificially inflate the market. It’s all a sham, just like the Trump presidency and how dangerous mail-in-voting is. Evil incarnate.

I’ll vote for Biden and his running mate no matter who that is. I believe in Joe’s values and know that he’ll choose a qualified running mate. He has a deeply impressive pool of candidates. ❤️
Biden is Looney toons! He may as well be 3 sheets to the wind cause he has dimentia and is usually incoherent.
Americans need to be able to believe what their president says. That ship has sailed for Donald Trump. We believe Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is a good person who will surround himself with experienced, smart, capable people who will protect social security, Medicare, Americans, healthcare and the institutions that keep us safe. And that is a hell of a lot better than what we have now. #TrumpsGenocide

Biden must do a speech and press conference about what Trump and the GOP are during with the Russians and to the US Postal Service in order to win this election!!!!!

We’ve had 4 years and the best we could come up with was Joe Biden. What a fucking joke. I don’t believe in politics and I never will.
Taylor swifts tweets ab the post office are so performative... she says vote trump out but didn’t give any resources on voter registry or tell us if she donated to Biden Harris

You make $4,000 per week and claim people who have been forced out of work by the Trump administration's inept handling of the pandemic do not deserve $600 per week. We don't care about your lies, Joe Biden is going to be the next president.
Do you really think he’s losing sleep over establishment Kamala?  The entire country rejected her just a couple months after she ran for president.  She called Biden a racist and says she believes his sexual accusers. You think she’s truly “team Biden?”  Easy win for Trump.
For shits and giggles, cause I don’t think we’re changing your mind...what if Biden wins decidedly...what would that mean to you?

Black and elderly people are disproportionately impacted by the removal of letter boxes and shutdown of post offices. Both of these demo graphs largely poll for Biden and have historically been redistricted to suppress their ability to vote. So, no. It doesn't effect both equally

Senator, you should be reminded that destroying any of your documents is a felony.   Seems to me that you are ALL in on defeating joe Biden because you are ALL in with a foreign adversary’s intend to keep a corrupt administration in power. You are dirty, sir. When did you turn?

Have we cured AIDS since 1980? Is there a vaccine? Yet for Covid we should have one already? This would be over if Biden were president? He has a better plan? A Mask Mandate- Really. So Masks first, quell the riots (cure AIDS) &amp; restore the economy. So easy! And not at all dumb!
The Biden campaign has used this pandemic to attempt to cancel fair presidential debates. Biden has used the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to blame on Trump and portray himself as the only economic savior of this country. Think again about who is taking advantage..
Why no questions to our possible next president?   What are they hiding?   Biden has dementia and even if elected he won’t be running our country the deep state corrupt actors will be running us.    Soros will be the president.
Good old Hussein is right about Biden’s ineptitude.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

With Biden in charge it will be the real deal a bloody affair that "reasserts the global leadership of the USA" or some other Public Relations, bullshit  Trump said he wouldn't recognize an electoral loss prior to "winning" in  2016 so repeating the same thing is no surprise
had the nerve to say President Trump “coddles” terrorists.   What planet is this lunatic on?  You mean like give Iran $150M in cash plus much more.  😂 Just another LIE from Biden
Trump tried to regime change Venezuela, it was the kind of half assed effort that has put him at logger heads with John Bolton &amp; the Neocons, the same Neocons who now back Biden so it's not a wash &amp; you are downplaying the imperialism that Biden represents &amp; why Neocons back him

It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.

I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office

Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!

If they supported Biden all he'd ever talk about is boater fraud.
Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.
Seems like you’ve give this a great deal of thought. I’m simply going to show up and vote#Biden/Harris
And like a typical right-winger, the point went right over your head. Let me help: ❌Biden didn't inherit an island ❌Biden didn't attach his name to businesses then run them into the ground ❌Biden didn't declare bankruptcy multiple times  ✅ Biden DID gain wealth honestly.
You don’t have to love, or even like Biden. Just VOTE for him
Biden's been talking about it since June:
How Indian Americans are reacting to Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP pick. From colleague
Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that "no one will be safe in Biden’s America" if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November.
Nope not at all.
Biden? This has nothing to do with Biden. This has to do with people from other states ignoring the fact that they don't vote in a Massachusetts Senate primary. Move on.
What does joe biden have to do with this
Trump will win in LANDSLIDE  These fake polls are the only indication that shows Basement Biden is still alive....
Joe Biden wants me dead  you do nothing by putting him in charge
Trump ads attack Biden with deceptive editing and hyperbole
You are a right winger! When your opponent is talking trash everyday, get out of the way. Joe Biden is a smart candidate.
Biden takes money from Big Pharma, and the private healthcare/insurance lobby.
Calm down. You said you would never support Joe Biden and Kamala Harris until you did this week. People change their mind, see how that works?
#DementiaJoe Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report  #FoxNews

Well let's not forget we Greeks were there first Dukakis/Bentsen 1988. Didn't do so well. Hoping for a win from Biden/Harris.
In MA we had Hillary flags, stickers, Bernie stickers, Warren, Markey, Joe Kennedy, Pressley signs, etc.  Much more than Biden.  It’s noteworthy.  Seen tons of back the blue flags and Trump stickers this summer.
Can you imagine Biden trying to explain or justify his actions that are part of the Durham Probe??  LOL.  Garbled mess.
Biden is taking a nap 💤
Also how do they expect those they diagnose as Russian bots to have the capacity to vote for Biden?
Alt-right is a hell of a drug.   Racists think Trump is racist, but he's actually not!   Meanwhile, not one communist on Earth thinks Biden is a communist, but he actually is!  Smooth galaxy brain.
and if we all actually did our research and realized the validity of third party maybe there’d be some fucking movement and progress within it. it doesn’t HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. seriously people, wake the fuck up. Biden is just a moderate, slightly less problematic Trump.
A website doesn’t sell policy effectively. Why doesn’t Biden himself ever outline his policy vision? Candidates like Warren, Sanders, Castro, &amp; Yang made detailed policy proposals in every public appearance. Biden refuses to describe how he’d govern so it’s hard to support him.
Since you are such a pig and a cheater, than you won't mind me saying fuck the Mail-in-Ballots because I am going to go and cast my Ballot for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in person wearing my mask this November 4th, and exercise my Constitutional Right to vote.
Joe Biden rocks!

Imagine if you were able to speak about the greatness of Joe Biden and how amazing of president he'll. If you could proudly state his policies daily with enthusiasm &amp; joy. Instead, you have to talk bad all the time about Trump. Its better to vote FOR something instead of Against!
We’ve had 4 years and the best we could come up with was Joe Biden. What a fucking joke. I don’t believe in politics and I never will.

Do you really think he’s losing sleep over establishment Kamala?  The entire country rejected her just a couple months after she ran for president.  She called Biden a racist and says she believes his sexual accusers. You think she’s truly “team Biden?”  Easy win for Trump.
For shits and giggles, cause I don’t think we’re changing your mind...what if Biden wins decidedly...what would that mean to you?

Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements.
Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.

Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough

Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.

Listen:  takes a look at the Democratic presidential ticket.   "This is going to be a very important election considering the changing demographics in our country. And it's going to really set the stage for future elections."
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!

If they supported Biden all he'd ever talk about is boater fraud.
Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.

Weekend at Bernie’s —I mean Biden’s
Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements.
Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
how is it my fault biden would veto m4a?
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.
Biden campaign working day and night to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
They are doing this to hide Biden. Look at the fire over here, and not our candidate who is “funny” to say the least.
he just means that Biden isn't mentally sound which like, yeah maybe, but you think Trump is????
Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough
With all that is happening to the country, Wisconsin must be so proud that their senator is devoting all his effort to investigating what Hunter Biden did two years ago.

You want us to believe that this happened six years ago but is just being publicized as Biden prepares to accept the Democratic nomination? Pathetic.
I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.

Listen:  takes a look at the Democratic presidential ticket.   "This is going to be a very important election considering the changing demographics in our country. And it's going to really set the stage for future elections."
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
If they supported Biden all he'd ever talk about is boater fraud.
Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.
In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. Jaime supports Joe .
I'm sure Obama will be pulling strings should Biden get elected.

No he got voted in because we were sick of liars like Obama and Biden.   Speaking as a real trump voter and and ex-democrat.
Yep, Don't show Biden and the non-existing policies.  Just "but Trump"  You could run a cardboard box against Trump and win.  Biden's team will most certainly lose.
You're both right 🙂 A third party vote is a vote Biden failed to earn that only functions to help elect Trump.   If you have no preference between Biden and Trump then feel free.
biden needs to heed it now
If Warren were to join a Biden administration, Pressley would almost certainly run in the special election, right? That’s why this is Joe’s best shot.

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.
And like a typical right-winger, the point went right over your head. Let me help: ❌Biden didn't inherit an island ❌Biden didn't attach his name to businesses then run them into the ground ❌Biden didn't declare bankruptcy multiple times  ✅ Biden DID gain wealth honestly.

PETER LUCAS: If Biden is elected, be prepared to live in the new dystopian United States
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden’s campaign
Oh sure - heck, I voted for her for Senate and was happy to do so. I still supported Bernie because I thought her M4A plan was weak, but still.  But no cabinet secretary wields more power than POTUS, and Biden is actively hostile to my interests. So... it's a rough choice.
And, again... I'm in MA. I have *massive privilege* in this situation; if I was in Michigan or something I would have to take a very different tack.  But if I want to see a world where some of the things I care about, like M4A, actually *happen*... I dunno if a Biden vote does it
Except I sorta feel like accepting that formulation is a good way to ensure that you'll *never* get something to vote FOR  Like, Biden is less bad than Trump, 100%. An ounce of crap is better than a pound of crap, too, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna line up to eat the ounce
I can understand that position, and I respect it wholeheartedly. And honestly, if I wasn't living in MA - a state that if Biden loses, he's got bigger problems than just me - I might feel the same.  My issue is... holding my nose is what I've had to do for multiple elections now.
Dear everyone trying to vote-shame me because my lack of enthusiasm for Biden somehow equates to supporting Trump in your minds:  Please stop. It's not going to work.

Not a fan of Biden policy at all. One’s Catholic faith is a personal walk with Jesus Christ. We are all sinners. The goal is to learn &amp; grow. I believe that there is no pro choice. It is pro murder. Christians who support this stance have to address in their time with Jesus.

If trump wins in November, then it will be proven that enough people lie to pollsters to ruin their usefulness forever. If Biden wins, we can chalk up 2016 as an anomaly.
He is also gathering ammunition, graciously supplied by Trump. He will unload it all when the leaves begin to turn .... Trump, meanwhile , is firing all his bullets now. By October he will have nothing new to say about Biden.
Let’s be clear  —  is a Rhodes scholar compared to dim witted Donald trump. He is also smarter and has sharper mental faculties than both you and trump. He will shred dumb Donald on the debate stage and would take you apart as a bonus .
Biden has reason to get into a back and forth “he said , he said” with trump every day. And daily “gotcha” grillings from the media don’t educate the voters about policy and principles. Frankly it’s refreshing not to have a campaign of sound bites.
I guarantee that after the first debate , whenever it is , trump will find an excuSe to try and cancel the others. Biden will mop the floor with him. Clinton tried to trade quips. Biden will undress him and show trump for the ignorant buffoon he is.

Real world: woman sometimes have careers then families. Guys are not caring for these woman, they are left with no money, no homes, abused and embarrassed to talk about it!! This is America! Biden did not  care. I'm a survivor, Am I glad? A different story to tell
Here us another woman tragedy story. Your newborn child looses her father to heroin, FENTANYL coming accross our borders. I was shocked to hear she is given $500 a month to live on. Shocked! Woman and children first? Biden never gave it a thought!! Or did Obama!!
Its nice to be rich, you would know, but poor because you gave time to your children  only to have your husband run off with another woman? Then there is the guy who never married you.SSDI is what ya get and its NOT ENOUGH FOR WOMAN. Biden never cared in 6 years!!
In six years Biden did nothing for SSDI people earning low pay, ZERO raises in 6 yrs. WOMAN, once again are discriminated against! We are earning less, because we are home caring for children!!
Figuring a disability check is done by recent work, well that is discrimination to woman, we work great jobs for 30 yrs, take time for a family of 3, now an unexpected domestic violence tragedy leaves women earning the lowest rate, $10,000 per year? Biden did zero!
Biden did nothing for people like me disabled from domestic violence earning less than $10,000 per year, because I am a woman who took time off from a career, single mom I add. Trump cares. Biden has no heart for America just for Hunter!! Who made disability about recent work?
I send mail all the time. Nothing I have ever sent in United States took more than a week to get there. I sent something to my son Monday it got there Wednesday this week!! You need to spend less time singing and  time researching Biden You Tube Ukraine. That's Biden lawbreaking!
Should he not have used drone strikes to kill terrorist? Lets not forget he took out 22 of the top 25 leaders in a Al-Qaeda. What should he have done differently? He also voted against the Iraq war so lets not forget that. As for Biden that bum has never seen a war he didn't love
how is it my fault biden would veto m4a?
Gotcha.  I dunno, I think Biden would still want her in the senate.
There is no way we could here in MA- they would really damage our home. But they can put Biden signs up? The hypocrisy is astounding

I totally agree. Biden needs to show what a leader represents because we don’t have one.
People screaming about how the Biden/Harris is flawed and therefore unworthy of your vote over 3rd party better check your fucking privilege before Trump gets elected and your country sinks even lower on the international stage than it has already.  Feel free to unfollow.
therefore cannot be equated with “helping trump” despite all the propaganda surrounding it.   liberals want anything anti biden to be pro-trump, so that way you aren’t allowed to be anti-biden (or anti-democrat) which is v fascist imo.   now you know, please don’t play into this.
such as my state, massachusetts, where biden will win by 30% of the vote.  most states are like this.  only a handful are “swing states” where there’s a chance the state flips.  because my state is decided, not supporting biden has zero effect on the election outcome and -
in the usa, presidential election is decided by counting up electoral votes, which are assigned by states’ winners.  so whoever wins my state, (biden) gets all 12 electoral votes.  then whoever hits 270 first wins.   at least 40 out of 50 states are very much decided...
Vaush made a really strong point: elect biden, dems can see how he too is failing. If trump wins, those dems will continue to just say how trump is the problem. The only way to move people left is showcase the failures of neoliberalism.
every time they say, "we are battling for the soul of the nation" take a shot. Double shot if Biden says it
Shots everytime Biden forgets where he is.
When Pelosi leaves the speakership, she will be remembered as either a) a genius who kept her caucus together, preserved her majority, and passed meaningful legislation during Biden's 1st term, or b) the utter incompetent who failed to stop Trump's authoritarian rise.
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.  If someone offers you a choice between chicken or a pile of shit with broken glass in it, you don’t ask how the chicken has been prepared.  If you can’t do the BEST thing, do the thing that sucks the least.
When a vaccine is available I want to see footage of every famous person getting poked in the arm, a full-court press across traditional and social media. Justin Timberlake, Oprah, Biden, Trump, Derek Jeter, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Grover, Laverne Cox, Beyoncé, Judi Dench…
An x-ray of what men want from women leaders? Be bold, I'll teach you how. But please be that little girl for me. And make me cry.
Why should Biden do anything different. Trump is drowning, why throw him a life vest?
1) mass incarceration/police accountability  2) universal healthcare 3) universal clean water/healthy food 4) the environment  5) continued native oppression 6) the wealth gap/crony capitalism   I don’t know that Biden’s significantly better that Trump on any except 2 and 4.
A)  is right. B) He disagrees with Biden on lots of stuff. He knows Trump is destroying the U.S.  He soon will be asked directly which one he plans to vote for, who he endorses.  Will he say what needs to be said then?
If by a miracle Joe Biden is elected it would be a disaster for the country.
correct their own June 26 post that "Biden Floats Baseless Election Conspiracy".
I just ordered a Biden/Harris mask.  I wonder if it would be allowed in a polling place. I’m guessing not, as campaigning  inside such places is not on.
Ha! Biden WENT THERE!
Imagine that, the president's ads lie about  Next question, eh,
We have to decide who we would rather negotiate with. Personally, I would rather deal with Biden/Harris than Trump/Pence.
So should Joe Biden and Donald Trump
Biden should do whatever works to get elected. He doesn’t owe you anything.  He’s been in the public view his entire adult life. People know what he’s about. And they know Trump is a criminal and a lazy moron to boot.
Here's Biden on violence against women:
Here's Biden on the opioid and heroin epidemic:
Here's Biden on violent crime (citing my plan from #BleedingOut):
" asked for each candidate’s views on nine specific areas of crime... #Biden’s response on the nine issues stretched over four pages... #Trump did not respond to the nine issues and provided no explanation."
Biden should do whatever helps him win. Plenty of time for pressers once elected
Joe Biden is Still lying after all these years!
Agree but Trump rarely answers tough questions.  He sidesteps them, swats them away, berates reporters who asks questions he's uncomfortable answering, etc.  So until Trump starts "answering" questions, then Biden doesn't need to hold weekly press conferences.
Biden and Harris absolutely do not have that
That would make sense if Biden was chicken and not just shit without the glass.
There’s two major scenarios right now:  1. Everyone votes, Biden or Trump becomes president 2. Not everyone votes, Biden or Trump becomes president  If your goal is to get people to break free of voting for Biden, you need to present a clear, well-planned third scenario
Maybe because the VP candidate has A LITTLE to do about USA and president candidate has any economic plan. Now, K.H. has a big platform about Human Rights IN INDIA  where an awful caste system condems human beings to be "untouchable", less than animals!
Kamala Harris has a little to change in the USA but a big platform for HUMAN RIGHTS IN INDIA WHERE AN AWFUL CASTE SYSTEM CODEMS INDIVIDUALS TO BE  UNTOUCHABLE! Harris 'electrifies' West Indian voters — and gives Biden a new edge in Florida  via
Because Trump ALWAYS LIES AND CHEATS. Biden is a man of honor and integrity....and he genuinely cares about others. I am a Republican and hope you spend the rest of your life in jail and eternity down below.
Why doesn't Pirro go on a bike ride with Biden? Let's see if she can keep up.
Biden's Budget}
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden  👍
For me, it’s no contest.  Trump is an outright criminal.  That evil far outweighs any flaws with Biden.
"Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment'...Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television"
OK so let's apply Kamala effect on everybody including Joe Biden
From my  piece earlier this year — has Biden answered this problem by making Harris one of “Our Own?”

The joy I feel, the joy I feel now that I’m  editing my scripts to ask voters if they’ll be voting for Joe Biden *and* Kamala Harris on November 3rd. Our girl really did make it and this Presidential ticket is the only place she deserves to be. ❤️💙🗳 #BidenHarris2020
this is futile to type out but ! for me personally i’m voting for biden out of fear of more trump / republican driven legislation. i’m disgusted by biden campaign / dnc not taking bolder avenues with abolishing police and prisons , foreign policy, etc
If Dems win, they will choose to "look forward, not back." Biden will continue most of the same policies, normalizing them. Trump will say something mildly critical of the next GOP fascist to be "elected" and be hailed as a part of the #Resistance.  If the US makes it that far.
Anyone who gets the Democratic Party knew Bloomberg was irrelevant:  If Bernie (or someone else not named Biden) won SC, (s/)he was going to be the nominee.  If Biden won SC -- even by 1% -- he was the best candidate to take on Bernie.
I said since the summer that Bernie/Warren/Amy/Pete would have to get at least 25-30% in SC to have a viable path to the nomination.  I said in the fall Biden getting 50-60% in SC would make IA/NH/NV irrelevant.  Glad I was right.
WOW. This #Biden ad 👇  #Election2020 #BidenHarris
people really be out here unironically using settle for biden posts to sway people to vote for him   I —
I admit the utter pants-shitting that would ensue if Biden gave her Treasury would be glorious, but yeah, just let her have the Banking Committee and a megaphone.
Biden- Harris! Let’s go!
South Asians for Biden Launches ‘Indians for Biden National Council’ ln Wake of Historic Biden-Harris Ticket
Biden/Harris are definitely not perfect but they are a billion fold better than Trump, his nepotism, and overall fascist behaviour that undermines the rights of our citizens. I can at least feel safe in knowing that Biden won't try to inhibit citizen votes in elections.
#LoserInChief  #BidenHarris2020 is coming for you! All your distractions &amp; lies won’t help! Can’t wait to see Biden kick your ass in the debate! 👏
my mom said I could go to my friend’s baby shower! so now I’ve gotta think of advice to write down but since I’m not a mom all I can think of is “don’t have kids” or “vote for biden so maybe the pandemic ends here someday and your kid can go to daycare/school”
Honestly, the Biden Ryan 2012 debate might have made the difference.
amplify this message now! Let them do their job!
i’ve gone over the fact that i’m in one of the many safe states, which means my vote for biden would not have any effect on trump’s re-election, just as my vote for hillary had no effect from MA.
Is there any suggestion of illegal behavior on their part (as opposed to their followers), or are they protected under the first amendment? Because I expect the Biden admin DOJ to be super careful about who they go after.
wildcard nice thing about potential Biden presidency: without the FBI having been entirely compromised, maybe the person or group known as "Q" will get unmasked and either apprehended, or have their accounts compromised / taken away.

my goal is universal healthcare, avoiding climate catastrophe, and boosting an alternative to our two-party oligarchy.   i can understand voting for biden in a swing state, but beyond that, why should anyone support him as a candidate when howie is also in the race?
my one vote - can push the green party to 5%, where they can get millions in federal funding and become a major party cannot affect the outcome of biden winning my state by *literally* nearly a million votes  in safe states, voting blue/red is more of a waste than green, cmv
but does me backing that “real opponent” do anything? how does me voting for biden actually accomplish anything, other than throwing away a vote that could’ve gone towards a party and candidate that support medicare for all and saving the planet and people on it?
Based on my read of the internet today, Trump is going to win re-election despite the fact that  1. Biden is ahead in every national poll, and in every swing state. Very clearly leading by a lot.  2. Trump is sabotaging the USPS and we all know about it 4 months in advance
I don’t think Biden is going to ban cheeseburgers or whatever, but I have done quite a bit of research on how much of the water in the American Southwest is diverted to cattle and cattle feed and oh boy is that gonna be a fuckin doozy for LA, Phoenix and Las Vegas soon enough.
I hadn't really paid much attention the Kamela Harris before the selection as VP on the Biden ticket. However, there is nothing like Trump calling her a nasty foreigner that makes me instantly like her.
This is really a coup and has to be stopped. Does anyone out there have any way to stop this? What about Biden, Harris &amp; Democratic leadership? Are they planning their own legal actions and strategies to fight this assault on our electoral system and democracy?
because in most states, like MA, biden is gonna win by 30%, nearly a million votes.  is there really any reason, in that situation, not to vote for the candidate that most closely aligns with my values?  personally, medicare for all is very much needed.
give me one good reason to vote for biden in a deep blue (or red) state
Oh you silly rabbits, only Republicans have mandates according to the national press corps almost all of which are employees of large corporations with large corporate interests. Biden could win by an historic landslide &amp; still be considered on shaky ground.
Your reminder that Joe Biden will be the only Presidential candidate this year to have corresponded with Hannah Arendt:
We'd have seen even more of this in the primary if COVID-19 hadn't gifted the nomination to Biden.
Thanks Brooke!  Please stay strong Sen. Harris of OAKLAND, CA!  We need you and Joe Biden now more than ever!
But it fundamentally in conflict with laying the groundwork for calling for mass demonstrations when Trump tries to steal the election. Trump is already prepping his supporters  for conflict - I don't know how Biden pivots to calling for mass demonstrations.
The "I'm going to make things calm and normal again" message is how Biden won the primary. It's probably the right tactic to maximize the number of people who vote for him in November.
I don't listen every week,  I've missed  a lot of episodes, but I agree w/ you. Unless I'm mistaken, most or all the hosts worked w/ Biden at the WH since they were part of Obama's '08 campaign &amp; worked at WH. They like Biden. Obnoxious for member of JB's staff to give that quote
I will commit to phone banking for biden if he bans pod save america from all streaming platforms
But the other option is Trump/Pence. By saying idk, are you saying that you’d rather consider them instead? For me, I’m saying let’s get Biden Harris in office and hold them accountable. We have a far better chance there than with Trump.
If "common sense" means abandoning attempts to finish sentences and "compassion" means playing a major role in almost every bad policy decision made by the US since the 70's, then, yeah, i guess vote biden??
With this coming election, it’s a game of lesser of two evils but it should really be who’s going to listen to their constituents regardless of their own beliefs. My hope is that with Biden/Harris, they show growth against their past actions and do what’s right for the people.
Vice President Biden was being a true leader unlike someone who thinks the virus will magically go away.
give any progressive/leftist this option right now, they'll vote Biden.  give any DNC person this option right now, they'll reject it.  it's not us that your problem is with.
Because  is a racist. #TrumpIsARacist #BidenHarris2020 #birtherism #BirtherismIsRacism #Birtherism2point0
2024?  i guarantee you Biden will be elected this November if we don't hear a fucking word about splitting a party or promoting republicans in 2024.  i guarantee it.  deal?
The Constitution says nothing about the number of judges on the Supreme Court. If Trump/McConnell mess with it before the next inauguration, then Biden should add two more justices.
No one of those things where Trump just repeats himself. Best job ever. China travel restrictions. Biden is a commie. Harris is nasty. Blah, blah, blah.
Vote Biden. You don’t have to be excited about him. He will be better. Consider where your strong feelings led you before. Vote with your reason this time.
Or let me spell things out a little clearer. It doesn’t even matter if Biden is senile from your deductions based on media clips (clearly scientific..). The decisions made in the Oval Office is already senile. So it’s a moot point. But I hope you find your solace in the debates.
i just don't understand how it wasn't expected that there would be a reaction to this vp announcement.  which, whatever, Biden can't control twitter, but he picked Harris in June, why not announce and get it out of the way 5 months before the election instead of 3?
unfortunately feds at protests and voter suppression are actually two things where Trump and Biden are almost identical, based on record.  this doesn't mean i'm saying there's no difference between them, but those aren't good examples.
This year’s election could lead to a significant change in the capital-gains tax rate—no matter who wins   via
Melania’s speech very clearly used Michelle’s as a template after some minor editing. Joe Biden used a similar metaphor to the one Reagan used, but his speech wasn’t based on Reagan’s. Can you see the difference through your partisan bias?
Vote Biden/Harris. They may not be your ideal ticket, but Trump is a disaster who will so much worse in 4 more years and no re-election to worry about
...now, in a world where according to you guys, everyone is shouting at people to not vote for him (which isn't true).  we can be honest.  Biden's whole platform is that he's not Trump.  the people on twitter you're mad at are preaching the exact same platform.
Not covering the fact that both Biden and Reagan used the word “possibilities”? Oh heavens no!
i don't agree, but either way, choosing not to _celebrate_ and pump the B/H ticket is too often being interpreted as hurting D, helping R.  and like, fuck you?  if you have to lie about your ticket to get support, all hope is lost.  we _don't_ have to.  Biden's up by 11 right...
It was more than a cliché, mate. That describes Biden calling America a land of possibilities, not the whole sentences Melania ripped off.
Melania stole entire sentences from Michelle, Mary. Biden just used the word “possibilities.”
Melania’s speech did indeed steal entire sentences from Michelle Obama, unlike this non-story about Reagan and Biden both using the word “possibilities.”
...voters being stupid.  misinformed, sure.  oppressed?  sure.  but you can't say someone saying "Biden fucking blows, Trump blows more" is misinforming anyone.  and on the initial reaction to Harris, comments are high.  relax, we all knew this was coming.
Lord forgive me but I made a Steamed Hams for Biden/Harris ticket
sorry, i've strayed, just, people will weigh their options, and people are more than welcome to convince them to vote Biden.  blaming people who point out the flaws in the D ticket as helping Trump is an admission that voters are stupid, and i never like basing things on...
Biden and Harris will know how to handle a pandemic, saving countless lives. Over 165K dead because of Donald Trump's mishandling of the pandemic.  Now he wants to rig the election again by defunding the USPS
Joe Biden: Still Got the Spirit
i mean, i think it's weird to blame Shaun.  but whatever, i can only speak for myself.  and i personally am thinking about not voting for Biden.  i've said, repeatedly, if i lived in a swing state, i would, but i live somewhere where's he's ahead by 33.  _33_.
i won't say vote for Biden either.  that doesn't mean you can't come to that conclusion all on your own because you're not a damn automaton who needs things directly spelled out for you.
And/or Biden
and i think this is the crux.  acting like anyone who isn't 1000% on board espousing the Biden/Harris ticket is seen as encouragement of abstain, and abstain = Trump.  WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STAKES ARE.  people can complain, and still fucking get it.
WSJ Opinion: A Biden Presidency Won't Help Black School Children
Shaun can speak for himself, but he seems to have the same gist, and he doesn't even get to vote here.  but he's never said voting for Biden is wrong and i've never said voting for Biden is wrong -- i'm saying there _are_ valid positions and reasons to not vote for Biden.
is a literal slap on the face to anyone who's been on the street since Ferguson.  am i recommending not voting for Biden?  no.  but fuck sugarcoating it, we're left with this guy, the not-so-much-racist-and-fascist-and-misogynist, to save us from outright fascism.
about encouragement.  but i mean, you really gotta want it.  a lot of people do want it, heh.  so i'll say the same things now: Biden is a terrible candidate, will be a terrible president, is not good on almost...any issue.  and the issue at hand, Harris as VP...
which maybe one would take as "encouraging people note to vote for Biden," but that's not true.  it's pointing out Biden's flaws.  and the only thing he's specifically encouraged for US voting is don't vote Trump.  now, i get the argument, and Vaush even made one specifically...
Sanders-voters are already blamed for Trump.  also the left != Sanders-voters, but that's for another time.  i've watched almost every Shaun vid, and just searched through his tweets about Biden, and honestly, he's only said nearly exactly the same things i've said...
Biden’s VP pick makes history, but not much sense- these people are so damn delusional they actually believe their own fake polls just like the last time!and if the left thinks women are going to blindly vote for Biden bcuz of kamala they’re wrong again.😄
I heard not only will Biden remove kids from cages but he will also be recycling those cages in order to build a bridge. And YOU can buy that bridge, DM for details
at the very least, i'd ask once again, who is it people are mad at?  who is it with some vast platform advocating against voting for Biden are you folk afraid is going to swing the election? cause again if it's just twitter peeps, maybe relax a little. (not saying u mad specific)
Per the CNN exit poll, 56% of 2020 SC Primary voters were African-American.  Further, per the exit poll, Biden won 61% of black voters in the Palmetto State.
What do  &amp;  think of #Russia?  compiled quotes from Biden and Harris on what U.S. policies towards Russia they'd pursue as well as on U.S.-Russia relations and Russia itself:
Oh lordy...lemme guess: Obama/Biden bad. trump good. Russia fake. Are arrests forthcoming?
Yup. I think he was almost certainly ratfucked out of the nomination again even before Biden made it explicit that they'd blame Sanders for every single person who died of COVID-19 during the primary, AND I no longer concern myself with what Sanders says.
Yes, some of the proposals made by Sanders would do much to address these concerns, but I doubt Biden/Harris is going to push much for free (state) college.
This has gotta be the 3rd or 4th poll today that I’ve seen with Biden in a double digit lead. Not ideal.
They are no better than Trump supporters! They are just as radical and unhinged! We need to keep pushing them, even if Biden gets in we can not stop the movement for BIG changes! Demand it!
Justin: "She is noted to be an energetic and exciting public speaker who can engage large crowds and draw national media attention, all traits that Biden has struggled to display."

This is what I'm saying. For YOU Biden is less bad. For somebody without health insurance, likely living paycheck-to-paycheck, they have an equal chance of dying or losing their homes. Biden (quite literally) tells such people not to vote for him. Just be aware.

Probably still not going to vote for President, but I actually kind of like Kamala. She sucks on a bunch of stuff, but on the whole she is better than anyone (except maybe Gore) who has ever been on the Democratic ticket. Maybe Biden will wander off into the woods or something
Ummm, no.  Like Bernie, Joe Biden came in to the nomination with a base.  Now you may not see them, because they’re darker (and older) ...
Or... they will die under either regime. For a lot of people, the two meal options are both broken glass. Biden, for you, isn't broken glass. Fine. Tread lightly around people for whom he is.
But once I saw this video after IA, I knew Biden was going to win the nomination:
Let’s spread the word. It’s time to take a stand.
To a shocking number of people, both candidates are broken glass. They'll die (literally) under either regime.  Now, to YOU, Biden may be a pile of crap and you vote for him because of it. Cool. But be careful not to attack people for whom both are broken glass.
It there is a Trump press conference today, will you turn off your TV and social media accounts? We will.
Joe Biden is a moderate.  is... I don’t know what. An opportunist?  A sell out?  A third rate anchor?
I kind of feel like not turning the A in Harris into a star of some kind is a bit of lost potential in the current Biden-Harris branding.
and once again, i think there is a very real _conversation_(not blind agree) to be explored more fully in terms of leftists in clinched states voting for Hawkins (if they like his policy), as there is virtue in a reminder that an anti-Trump mandate is not a Biden-platform mandate
i don't agree with that at face.  i'm also still not sure who you're talking about, because i think it's just people on twitter.  like Ryan Knight has 373k followers, Biden has 8.3m.  Sanders himself is actively advocating for Biden, and not even pointing out his negatives.
is that why you want to get involved in Biden's administration ?!!!?
Again: not ideal, not perfect, not full-proof, ad hoc, imprecise definitions of "masking", varying enforcement. List goes on.  But one (damn) state at a time, Trump has lost this fight that is, only in his world, a fight.   He is the outlier, not Biden.  Report it that way.  6/

How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries  Biden winnowed a large list to four finalists before settling on Harris, in a process shaped by questions of loyalty. He is eyeing other contenders for top administration jobs.
just because it might be loud right now doesn't mean no one is going to vote for Biden.  and yes, some are saying they won't vote D, but i think we're all conflating immediate response to an event for national trends.
personally, i've criticized Biden this entire cycle, and also said i'd vote for him if i lived in a swing state for sure, and might even tho i don't.  i can't get on board with the thought of absolute hearts and smiles.
She is not capable of not following where the winds blow her. Plus, Biden has always been pro creditor.
This is leadership 😂 Biden: "I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. The kids used to come up and reach in the pool &amp; rub my leg down so it was straight &amp; watch the hair come back up again. So I learned about roaches, I learned about kids jumping on my lap..."
alas, i am not advocating for not voting for Biden overall.  i am saying there are acceptable reasons to vote for, say, Hawkins, in certain states, or if finding Biden completely morally objectionable. and it's fine to criticize the ticket, any ticket, without burning it all down
Hillary Clinton stated that she will participate in Biden's administration - very strong reason to believe that Dems have something up in their sleeve
Has ANY pollster tried to estimate likely voters accounting for GOP voter suppression effects on R vs D voting?  Marquette University poll showed HUGE differences in R vs D voters for mail-in vs in-person voting.  Are current large Biden poll advantages completely misleading?
i agree completely, but it's also prefectly acceptable to recognize problems and not get into the "D ticket is perfect!" narrative.  also very real reasons to not vote Biden, such as credible accusation of sexual assault, or just living in a state where he's polling +30.
Ok I needed a good laugh today! 😂Blaming your mishandling of the virus on Biden? Sorry little buddy, this ain’t gonna fly with voters. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
A lot of people considered Joe Biden a total joke for most of his career. And yet here we are ! He is a literal bridge between the first African American president and the first female African/Asian American vice president. Luck 'o the Irish ! 🍀
Hysterically funny that Trump lies about following the science. He is so obviously ignorant of science ie drink Lysol to kill the virus. Most children cleaning fluids are poisonous!  Biden &amp; Harris are intelligent solid people who can follow science &amp; have common sense!
The world laughs right now at Trump as the bully clown failing to lead the USA.  Biden will rebuild the respect America always had before the Trump Administration!
Foxnews just had Kellyanne Conway stating that a mandate for masks was what the Trump administration has been advocating for and that Biden is just plagiarizing Trump
Joe Biden has more religious credibility than any nominee of either party going back to Jimmy Carter. He does NOT have a problem with religion at all. Like Christ, Joe was Resurrected (by Jim Clyburn) !
I mean... Biden's no Socialist yet he likes to get publicly owned with his asinine statements so...
Yeah I mean it’s definitely concerning bc some polls have shown most Biden supporters plan to vote by mail, but the fact is we know about the problem and the Dems can plan ahead by encouraging early voting and dropping off mail ballots in drop boxes if possible.
If people don’t get their mail ballots, most of them will probably just go vote in person. Biden’s lead will probably tighten, but it’ll probably still be high enough that some ballots getting to election offices too late won’t swing the entire thing.
The Biden comeback isn't just something the Democrats are self-congratulating over -- conservatives think it was stunning too.
You're really discounting how genuinely miraculous the consolidation around Biden was. Without him overperforming his polls in SC off of 3 terrible first contests AND Buttigieg + Klobuchar endorsing him AND him overperforming on Super Tuesday Bernie actually could have won
True. Biden will almost certainly not be able to confirm her without the Senate, but at this point that might be true of literally his entire cabinet depending on how Mitch wants to play things.
Reminder: a vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for college football in the spring.
Sounds like music 🎶, isn’t Biden? Biden ? Biden ... ah you can’t hear me you’re in the basement 😜
You assume I would vote for Biden if Hawkins weren't on the ballot. You're wrong. Go recruit non-voters if you think your case is so strong. I'm always voting to the left because that's the best way to pressure the system and strengthen our movement.
To be fair, I don't think Harris will hurt Biden as much as Palin hurt McCain in the election. Palin completely destroyed the McCain candidacy.
As someone else recently put it, any progressive action will be organized around, over, under, or careening through a Biden Administration, but it will not be coming from, by, or with a Biden Administration. At best, they will do *slightly* less to actively impede &amp; detain us.
The important thing to understand about a potential Biden Administration is that progressives or leftists of any kind and tendency will not be running it, will not be co-running it, will not be a junior partner in it, will for all intents &amp; purposes not be part of it.
a must-read for anyone pushing the "but you *have* to vote for Biden" line
It's actually Biden (2020-2022) Harris (2022-2024) Buttigieg (2024-2032) Chasten (2032-2040), but I don't blame you for underestimating Chasten. Easy mistake to make.
A model that's still almost certainly more accurate than all other models out this year, just like his 2016 model crushed the competition?  95% confidence for Biden is not correct.
Biden/Harris raised almost as much money in 48 hours as Biden did in all of 2019, $59 million.

Insightful background about the process/priorities in Biden's VP decision. Comforting that they agreed to Biden's staff leading any decisions around building the combined Biden/Harris team after some of the personnel challenges in Harris' primary campaign.
Biden/Harris need to shout this out that anyone complicit could face consequences
Here is their "leader". He has the brain power of Joe Biden:
President Trump, you just can’t stand strong outspoken women of color. You insult them all the time in a disgraceful racist manner. I will certainly welcome VP Harris along with President Biden in January.Biden is unable to answer a question w/o coming across as a senile old miserable fool. Hope he can’t dodge the debates. If the moderator asks him a basic question he’ll respond by saying c’mon man &amp; r u a junkie, did u get drug tested b4 this debate.
This.
Its super funny to me how the members of the CBC have to let Biden twist in the wind instead of taking any responsibility for the Crime Bill they definitely made him continue to advocate for after all the amendments.   And it might lose the election for the Dems.
This is the first Biden sign I have seen in Massachusetts.
Biden should run on that.
You don’t know if this will happen tho your taking a chance on children’s lives. Biden is a straight up pedophile no denying it so how does someone like him not be investigated.
I think Biden might have his full promoting democracy in USA
I don’t care: popular vote or just electoral college,  if the voting public of the US does this again that means there are more racist, sexist, brutal, &amp; nasty people in that country than any other in the history of the world. Who wants to live in that?
Saw a Biden sign. Kinda like it
And this is exactly why he wouldn't vote Biden, cuz Biden doesn't want anything to change.
And you were recently on fence about voting for Joe Biden
Considering the National Letter Carrier Union’s recent endorsement of Biden, any Trump supporter who has a sign indicating so in his or her front yard, should either vote in person, or drive their ballot to town hall themselves.  No joke. Just be safe.  You never know.
Something is not passing the smell test for me.  In their three joint appearances so far, neither Biden nor Harris have taken any press questions.  And now, it looks like none of Biden’s campaign are going to be making appearances on the Sunday morning talk shows tomorrow...
'I'm disgusted with Trump': Arizona Republican explains why he's voting for Biden
"Bernie has pushed Biden so far to the left!"  Biden is still to the right of the entire rest of the Democratic presidential candidates except Bloomberg
if he is voted out for Biden, either be will seize control, or liberals will quickly forget about him and rehabilitate him in 10 years.  if the people revolt, things could end very differently.
I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention but Joe Biden promised to stop arming the Saudis
I thought you consider AOC an imperialist because she’s voting for Biden.
Are you really an anti-imperialist if you can’t decide between Trump and Biden?
I'm just listening to that Virginia Mayor give a LAME apology on TV but the funny thing is... He NEVER apologized to Kamala Harris or Joe Biden! I don't think he's sorry, I think he's sorry that everyone got mad &amp; he prob almost lost his seat on city council!
Theoretically that could happen, but realistically...not a chance. I dont think all 3rd party candidates combined will even get 5%. Mass is winner take all, and overwhelmingly blue. Biden is totally safe. Swing states should still vote blue though
HOT TAKE: Biden is obviously much better than Trump, but still irredeemable trash. Since he will inevitably win Mass, I'm using this opportunity to vote Green. I KNOW Hawkins won't win, but he's my preferred candidate of the 3. If this was NH, I'd suck it up and vote Biden.
I was shocked Biden won, it was hugely off from polling and I don't know anyone who supported him.
Trump has my vote. Biden is a nut
Biden is a good man, hes lost so much that he understands real Pain! He doesn't have a racist bone in his body! For me I feel at his age he knows what must be done to make this country work for all of us. He cant b bought &amp; he doesnt Lie, this is his legacy &amp; will work hard 4 us!
Normally I wouldn’t consider something like this a big deal cuz a lot of their members would vote differently but in this situation I’m sure their ALL pissed enough to vote Biden
Ask Baker if he supports Biden’s call for a mandatory mask mandate from all Governors. Let’s find out how left Baker has gone
Biden could be dancing naked to "YMCA" while Jill greases him up with crisco for his "naughty boy whips &amp; chains" session.... All while his hair is pink &amp; I will still be voting for Joe...😂 #BidenHarris2020
How Biden Chose Harris: A Search That Forged New Stars, Friends and Rivalries
Everyone wants changes to be made for voting in this election due to the Coronavirus, but for some reason, the Biden camp refuses to consider moving up the debate schedule to accommodate the larger than normal early voting.  Something is not adding up. #Debates2020
So is it ok for the Trump campaign to spy on Biden/Harris now??   ?
...has been usually lost in the mainstream media coverage of the event.  This event is a few years old, but Biden has been bringing it up and that is why it is getting attention again.
President Trump has taken questions at the end of all his press conferences the last several days since the VP announcement. (He almost always does anyway.)  Biden and Harris have taken a grand total of zero at their three events together so far.  🤔
Hold your nose and vote for Biden to get the psycho out of our house before he screws anything else up.
"Top former aides ... David Axelrod and [ Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor, Jon Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer—at times ridiculed the former VP’s campaign. Biden is one of the few candidates to have not gone on either of their popular podcasts ... despite having been invited"
Great behind the scenes long-read.“numerous administration veterans ... remember it differently: Obama had begun embracing Clinton as a possible successor years before Biden lost his son, while the VP was laying the groundwork for his own campaign.”
If I want to survive the coronavirus (I'm at high risk), I must vote Biden.
PETER LUCAS: If Biden is elected, be prepared to live in the new dystopian United States
Vote for Biden. He will bring back our country.
It is not because Kamala Harris is a woman, or because she is not white, that people like me have an issue with her, and might be perceived as “freaking out” about her.  It’s 1) her views on the issues, and 2) considering Biden’s age and evident cognitive decline, the reality...
I agree - I can’t stand Trump but I won’t vote for Biden either because of this. I will blank the ballot for the second presidential election in a row.
John, you know perfectly well that when an incumbent runs for re-election, it's always a referendum on his job performance. NOT a choice between the incumbent and the challenger. With 180,000 dead by Election Day, Trump will lose no matter what Biden says or doesn't say.
Media Consolidation.... Ed MARKEY &amp; JOE BIDEN LEAD THE WAY! LISTEN 👂 TO YOUR RADIO 📻 STATION? DIFFERENT CONTENT FROM 25 years ago! I WONDER WHY? 🤔🇺🇸🧐 -THE HIP-HOP REPUBLICAN #Mapoli #Bospoli #Embargo

'PRESIDENT' BIDEN IS CLEAR, WE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO BEAT THIS VIRUS... If you want your life back pls, wear a mask!  P.S.A. One of those 40,000 lives that you save,  may just be your own or someone you love!
Trump has shot America in the lung. Liberals propose electing Biden cuz he promises to put a bandaid on it, but whats needed is emergency surgery. Meanwhile, Biden announces his plans to improve on Trump's policies by shooting us in the leg next time.
I have heard Some catholics say they can’t vote for Biden because he supports abortion, meanwhile #DonaldTrump does not go to church......give that some thought
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden’s campaign
Now that would be making America great again. So another words..nope not gonna happen. Their not going to bite the hand that feeds them. Last thing they want is Joe Biden getting elected. They know they’ll b richly rewarded by trump getting rid of USPS
It seems like if Biden loses we’re not getting a better candidate next time. No valid reason not to vote for Biden.
I mean I'm sure you tweeted this same thing after Biden pronounced her name wrong yesterday right?
we will storm the polls and vote and the BIDEN administration will start the process of healing our country.
Obama/Biden literally built the cages and filled it with kids before 2016
You think things like bounties on our military men could happen under Biden, like it has under Trump, a virus consuming our country, lack of morals, befriending chid traffickers.
Thank you Project Lincoln you Guys are AWSOME love your ADS keep them coming. And i will keep sharing,  Biden 2020 bring on the Blue Wave.
Ok. Go convince voters who actually would support biden bc i dont vote rapists on principle.
Trump is not a true leader! But at least he has the stones to stand up for our Country &amp; answer for his own actions, while Joe Biden runs &amp; hides. Jill Biden answers more for him than he does! Ask yourself, what has he really done in his 50 year Pol-Career, all on the US $$!
When Biden was nominated for President and led in Polls
The other possibility is that Biden is so deep into dementia he just isn't aware that it's a hoax.
There's less here than meets the eye. Biden's exact words were that each of the state governments of the 50 states should implement a mask mandate. Which, btw, is what happened with car seat belt laws. Each state has its own, and they differ from state to state.
Private prison industry backs Trump, prepares if Biden wins
Can Joe Biden’s VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris, the first Black and South Asian American woman to be selected for a presidential ticket of a major party, help Biden win over independents and conservatives?  experts say she is ‘the safest choice’
Fuck Joe Biden.  #DefundKamala
EDITORIAL: Biden’s VP pick puts U.S. on cusp of history
This is a widespread view among conservatives. On right-wing websites, you'll see plenty of speculation that the DNC will kick Biden off the ticket, possibly replacing him with Hillary.
The good ratings were following Harris and Biden
You could say the same thing, only worse, about the Obama Biden admin.  The unemployment rate finally fell to where it was when they took office 6 years later.
Biden is senile not insane, but you're right, a third will stick to him no matter what.
We are making history again as Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his running mate! We are getting close to possibly having our first ever female Vice President. #CrystalTimeMachine
There is simply no greater moral or human rights  issue in our time than abortion.  It kills more innocent people than anything else.  I hope people understand the gravity of this issue, and think long and hard before voting for Biden/Harris or anyone of any political party...
...would be the most pro-choice, pro-abortion one ever.  The differences could not be more stark.  For those of us who believe in the sanctity of all human life from womb to tomb, the prospects of a Biden/ Harris Presidency should cause us grave concern.
In this election you will see the greatest disparity in terms of candidates positions on abortion than ever before.  The record clearly shows Trump/Pence is the most pro-life, anti-abortion administration since Roe v Wade, and it also shows a Biden/Harris administration...
I had my doubts about Biden’s Catholicism already with his stance on abortion, but his selection of someone like Harris, confirms my belief that he does not take it very seriously.
But upon reflection, I think that speaks to the reality that everyone is thinking right now, that Kamala would really be the President if they are elected, considering Biden’s age and clearly evident cognitive decline.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed past their one-time political rivalry to deliver an aggressive attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump in their historic first appearance as running mates.
The fact that she was “ mean” to  &amp; he picked her anyway shows that Biden is a strong man who doesn’t need or want sycophants around him. No wonder you don’t understand it.
So Biden works hard to get things done where you just roll on by? Got it.
To all BIDEN/HARRISsupporters... Newsweek is letting a Repubican Racist start another birther bullshit campaign on Kamala! #WeHaveMomalasBack
It took me a while to find Biden palatable, so forgive me if I feel the same way about Kamala Harris. I need to warm up to her
I mean, I think its that the establishment wanted her all along, and this way when Biden inevitably dies, 🤷‍♀️
Nah, Barr coming down with indictments in late October. If it's looking grim for Trump's re-election expect Biden, Obama, Comey and Rice to be arrested
If Biden wins, I think we can pretty much cancel out any progressives as president for the next 12 years at least. The assumption is Biden does 1 term. It’s hard to see Harris losing a primary after being the VP so that’s a possible another 8 years.
Perhaps but history is against her - George HW Bush was only VP since Martin Van Biden to become president after his predecessor competed his term
No need donny, Joe Biden will take care of that!!! Fuel up the plane and head for Scotland!!!!
*Joe Biden straightens his tie, clears his throat, and delivers his monologue. He pauses, glancing at Trump, waiting for his rebuttal. But there is silence. Trump is looking past him, staring into space. Biden wheels around, and sees this waiting for him.
Billionaires also have the same spending limits for campaigns as we do. PACs are a different story, but since this story was about the Biden for President campaign it includes the FEC.
Really not feeling motivated to volunteer for a Biden/Harris ticket but there's plenty of down ballot races to be excited about. Right?
I mean Biden beat her head to head in the primary election, she dropped out because she was polling even with Tom Steyer, and the more people got to know her, the less they liked her. This is the honeymoon period, the media is hyping her. She brings zero new voters
Biden and his new partner Kamala. He calls women by their first names all the time. Dr. Fauci and Debra. Biden and Kamala. Governor Cuomo from New York and Gretchen from Michigan.
Bill Barr arresting Obama and Biden in late October is in play
I'm looking forward to voting for these two. Enthusiasm level just went up a notch or two.  #BidenHarris2020   Watching Joe Biden Introduces Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) As Running Mate
No. But maybe Biden, working with Dr. Fauci and other experts and congressional leaders, can find ways to prevent thousands more deaths.
Yes ! Obama/Biden pulled us out of the depths of the Great Recession.  Trump Killed it all!
Wow! That live address from Biden &amp; Harris knocked it out of the park! And the music before? Hell yes!
The saddest thing will be if Biden wins. Then it is the fault of all the fools who voted for him!!
biden would be still digging the hole at nearly the same speed lol
Their talking points had Biden being a segregationist all the way back to yesterday morning. They are so confused.
I agree wholeheartedly. But I will say that as a progressive myself, the only ways to get progressive leaders in office is through Democratic seats. It’s the nature of the system and we have to game it. I don’t want Biden, but I’ll vote for him. KH is the 4th most prog Senator rn
Joe Biden wanted a female minority VP running mate. But, Tulsi Gabbard was never in the mix 😆
It will be the fight of our lives but our chances to get something resembling #UBI or #mc4a or #GreenNewDeal are much better with a Biden Harris white house then with a trump one. And this is coming from someone who was willing to let it all burn down 4 or 5 months ago.
biden is a racist. there are countless receipts on this. just because someone explicitly doesn't say "i hate black people and minorites" doesn't mean they aren't racist.
I'm not "voting blue." I haven't become a Dem. I am voting for Biden as a one-off in order to fire Trump for his incompetence on COVID, which led to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. #LincolnVoter
The problem for Biden is that while he is historically a pretty mainstream Democrat, his platform is pure woke.  Harris is young and presentable but how does a former "cop" fit in with a "defund the police" party?
It doesn’t matter. People that like Harris were voting for Biden anyways. Doesn’t hurt, doesn’t help. Won’t pull many progressives and won’t pull many independents.
I am member of pissed off old men for BIDEN.
now, more than likely, Biden knows how it goes, and he explicitly did not promise anyone anything - just a wink and a nod. But as Yang said, he probably nevertheless made it clear without outright saying it.
Harris/Pence debate is going to be anticlimactic. Pence is pretty reserved and will be harder to rattle than Trump. A Harrris/Trump debate would be great I think. Biden would be better off having her do it anyways.
JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME WINNING #OHIO WITH JUDGE &amp;  GOT BLACK MEN IN JAIL FOR MARIJUANA?   WHAT ABOUT #PENNSYLVANIA? WHERE JUDGE BRINKLEY IN PHILADELPHIA. AN AKA LIKE HARRIS HAD TO BE FORCED TO RELEASE MEEK MILL? #hiphop #HipHopMusic #MaPoli 🇺🇸
I said from the jump the only people I wouldn’t vote for under any circumstance was Biden, Buttiegieg, and Bloomberg when he joined. All of the others I could have possibly mustered up enough will to vote for.
Harris being VP won’t get me to vote for Biden. But I would probably vote for her if she was the nominee. I still don’t like her but I can sleep at night voting for her.
I have stopped with the Joe Biden and Trump are the same arguments though. Mostly because I have to believe Biden and the people around him would have handled this pandemic better. But honestly that’s the only difference I see. But that one difference is HUGE.
I’m so glad I’m not in a swing state lol. I can be comfortable knowing my mind is made up on not voting for Biden. Not sure if I’m writing in or going Green Party but I know for a fact Biden isn’t getting my vote.
This is Maureen Dowd-level stupidity regarding very recent history. I mean, Biden was a key link in keeping that streak going, you pedophile-enabling homophobic jackass!
I’m not questioning her qualifications. Just the selection by Biden.
Biden seeks-out his own level of integrity.
Yeah I’m not that naive to junk that it’s all the candidate. But all the talking points today has tried to paint the picture that it was Biden who is bringing her in.   But after all the animosity during the campaign it just doesn’t seem like it’s a blend of ideas here.
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
She’s staying there for us! Please elect Biden so that poor lady can FINALLY get some rest!
Both could be an option but don’t feed me the line that it was all Biden.
Honest question.   Did Biden really pick Harris or did the DNC pick Harris for Biden?
I’m a white guy. I’m doing fine, thanks. And I’ll be voting for Biden. I just wish I could vote for sexy Scott B over Ed Markey.
Biden picks Kamala Harris as running mate, first Black woman
JOE BIDEN &amp; KAMALA HARRIS TARGETED BLACK MEN! THE MORE BLACK MEN THEY INCARCERATE? THE MORE MESSR SHOWS FAVOR! 🇺🇸 #MaPoli #BosPoli #Kamala #EMBARGO
One thing i realized is Trumps just not strong enough to have a woman by his side as president! Hes a misogynistic asshat! Biden is man enough to have Kamala by his side, who will hold her own &amp; be a partner in leading this Country into an America that is... "OF BY &amp; FOR THE PPL"
Maya Rudolph reacts to Kamala Harris as Biden's VP pick, her SNL return
And she also beleives Trump raped Young Girls....Ill leave my kids with Harris &amp; Biden
if Biden cut a deal with her to drop out in exchange for VP, thats literally illegal
Why you think things will get better with Trump losing when the Dems have already proven themselves enablers of him confuses me. Biden is just gonna continue Trump's policies. He said is gonna keep building the wall, gonna keep crushing the protests, gonna keep secret police...
Every time I hear the name Beau Biden my brain involuntarily says “banana fanna fo fiden” #BidenHarris
Donald Trump isn’t going to go after policy issues. He’s going to go after the context of Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’ character. Donald Trump is and always will be weak.
lol Biden as a reformer
so, we defeating Biden/Harris and Trump/Pence, then? cool! #VoteGreen2020
i am sorry you cannot have ACAB as your twitter name and support Biden/Harris. You're gonna explode in a puff of logic any second now.
every second u spend arguing with leftists online who have genuine concerns abt biden is time u can spend phonebanking for biden ;)
im sorry, do u actually think i follow everything that comes out of bernie's mouth? lol i disagree heavily with bernie's methodology and i frankly think he was too cowardly with what he had to endure twice. if u really wanna help joe biden get elected u should go phonebank.
Biden already got my two votes!😄
Was Kelly WAS........ We will be much better off with Biden and Harris!!!!
So Biden has a VP.  TAKE MY VOTE ALREADY
Why don't you explain to them that this can be a one-off for them? They just have to vote for Biden, that's all. Maybe asking them to become *Democrats* is a bit too much for them.
This can only be true if you don’t count Biden as catholic, but if you don’t count Biden as catholic, then the 2008 and 2012 ticket also didn’t have a catholic. If that’s the case then this isn’t the first time in a long time... So eitherway you are lying.
You think joe Biden will be any better than trump? The man literally can’t form a damn sentence but I guess incompetence is the only competence y’all see in order to really think the democrats are “for the people”
Bernie supporters vote so much he lost to Clinton and Biden. That's horrible.
Democrats are risking everything by choosing to have a candidate that’s running on “not Donald Trump” as opposed to having a candidate running on real change. If Biden loses they will blame everyone and everything except their own corruption.
And if they're going to give Bernie credit for voting for VAWA or gun restrictions in the 1994 bill they need to give Biden even more credit, by their own logic, because he wrote it and didn't just vote for it.
So now that we know Biden's VP is definitely a woman, will Pence be ok being alone on a debate stage with a woman that's not his wife?   Will he have to ask Mother for permission?
literally screaming defund the police and biden chooses the alpha police lieutenant law enforcement officer general cop for VP. 😪.
Are you happy with Joe Biden’s choice of running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris?
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate
how does one ignore that Kamala Harris said she believes the women who accused joe Biden of sexual assault and then runs w him make it make sense 😞
DONALD TRUMP DEFEATED HILLARY IN WISCONSIN, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, &amp; Florida..  Which of these States does Joe Biden take back to win the Presidency.? 🇺🇸🤔🧐   #BidenHarris #VicePresident #KamalaHarrisForVP #COVID #BreonnaTaylor #EMBARGO 🎁 #HipHopMusic #HipHopRepublicans
Im lgbt+ and biden would hurt me too and go lookup deportation statistics under obama
Kamala was honestly the only person Biden could have went with in 2020. A centrist who is also a black woman. I’m not voting for him but it could help with some potential voters.
Stop. Is that who Biden picked?
Thanks to the Biden VP announcement!  #BidenHarris2020  #BidenHarris2020Landslide  #TrumpIsLosing
2. Warren can enact more substantive change from a cabinet position or as a lioness in the Senate.  3. Biden is going to be one term. This VP is likely the 2024 candidate. 4 years from now Warren will be 75. Hence the need for somebody younger.  Again, I say as a huge Warren fan.
If Trump wins then the dems have themselves to blame, so many better candidates than Biden
Just tried to buy my Biden/Harris merch, and I think the site is crashing already! Too many AWESOME PEOPLE on there!! YEAH, BABY! Feel that #BlueWave rising? #BidenHarris2020
Nothing is ideal, Biden is my last choice, it is what it is. I’m all in to salvage democracy.
It’s a real race to the bottom this year. I’ll admit I didn’t have “Biden picking a cop as vp  in the midst of nationwide blm protests” on my bingo card.
She did so bad in the Democratic debates she couldn't make past Iowa. The only person she "annihilated" was Biden and got ended by Tulsi.
Joe Biden, a conservative Democrat, picks Kamala Harris, a pro-law enforcement Democrat, during a time when the country wants law enforcement reform. At least it’s a woman, and a POC. I’m still voting Trump out, but his pick solidifies his position as against progressives ideas.
good luck. I like you and your platform. I'm not a Biden fan. I'll be looking for you in 2024
Biden/Harris. Love it.
Y’all remember when Kamala called Biden out for being friends with racist segregationists. Guess Kamala doesn’t.
Yep! It’s proof that Biden isn’t afraid of strong women and is willing to surround himself with smart people who will disagree with him. Yahoo!
#VPPick  I’m a little surprised; I thought it was going to be #SusanRice . I’m not sure how Kamala helps Biden in the swing states.  It will be interesting to see how/ if this pic helps or hurts him.
Extremely happy about this. BIDEN/HARRIS 2020  Lowell, Massachusetts
Yes!!! The best choice for this moment!! Biden/Harris 2020!!!
100% not voting for Biden now
I promise that I will be as excited by Biden's VP choice as I was when Obama chose Biden.
Kamala Harris is Biden’s VP pick!!  Yes!!!!!!
Biden-Harris baby gonna mop the floor with Pence in the debate #BidenVP #BidenHarris2020
Biden should announce his running mate at the same moment trump steps on stage for yet another one of his WH rallies!!
THE RUSSIANS HAVE STARTED PUTTING OUT FALSE INFO ALREADY... ITS NOT GONNA WORK, SORRY! I cant wait to see Putin on bended knee to "PRESIDENT BIDEN"🇺🇸
Biden isn’t a Traitor, or a pedophile, or a mass murderer, Junior. Nice weak tea you’re serving! #TraitorTrump
Biden will mop the floor with him. But no debate until we see the taxes!
Look, if the most important issue to you is abortion, then absolutely you cannot vote for Biden. But given everything that's happened to America, even an evidently religious person like yourself should give equal weight (at least) to other issues this year.
Graham also didn’t want to rush into any investigations of his good ole friend, Joe Biden’s son, about Ukraine. Over his long years of knowing Joe, Graham has thought him an admirable public servant.
I will only vote blue if Biden himself is replaced, so no, it won't change anything ❤️
Clearly it means "Vote for Biden. He keeps the 10 Commandments." (my tongue is only a little bit in my cheek)
I voted for her of course but I do think she could've done a better job campaigning and debating. Didn't come across strong or sincere. Im hoping Biden gets his game on soon. He's ok but needs some more fire. I think.😬
I feel dumber every time I hear you speak. You’re a fraud, a cheater, and Joe Biden could beat you in a battle of the brainless.
I will still vote for biden. But I agree with this sentiment
Hey if I bring up issues about Biden then it erases everything terrible Trump has done, right?
I come from a Military Family, that being said if you vote for trump a man who knows putin put a bounty on our Soldiers that’s UN-AMERICAN !!! Our President DOES NOT HAVE OUR SOLDIERS BACK SO LETS SHOW THEM THAT WE DO BY VOTING FOR JOE BIDEN!!!
Does she forget blaming losses in heavily Blsck states in uneducated and under informed voters?

Whomever Biden chooses to be his running mate will not affect my vote, unless of course it's anyone named Trump. And, though it's not urgent that I know today, making the announcement soon is the right thing for him to do. 💙

Is Hunter Biden in politics? Is he actively commenting on Politics or involved in any Political Campaign? NOPE. So STFU
Biden's communication team must respond quickly and repeatedly.
stop this nonsense about electing Biden, a sick man, president.
They’ve stooped to gathering fake signatures to get Kanye West of all people on the ballot in key states. Hmmmm, trying to steal votes from Biden? tRump maybe demented, but Kanye is downright crazy. And there will be people that will vote for him.
IMO its admirable Biden decided to choose a woman, and terrible he announced it before hand. As you say, it pits women against each other, but also because it alows people to devalue the choice by implying the choice was because she was a woman, and not the most qualified
I feel like Biden was giving us a quest when he told the corn pop story &amp; now we all have to track him down &amp; duel Corn Pop to get a rare piece of armor or something
#VoteOutRacism by refusing to vote for Biden or Trump. Both are racist. Trump is spit in your eye racism, Biden is write a bill criminalizing your existence racism.
Biden is harder to hate than Hillary was.
I hope that Biden will take direction from Dr. Fauci rather than Laura Ingraham. She has a lot to answer for.
Plenty of us Americans aren't sure that it's Joe Biden. All we know for sure is that it's not Trump.
Biden should contact leading COVID epidemiologists immediately. (Maybe have one as a campaign adviser). Come up with a reasonable plan, present it during the campaign, and get ready to put it into effect on Day One of his new administration.
Yeah true, I’m not arguing that. I’m just saying that it’s false that African Americans are not diverse, like Biden suggested
It is about race when you suggest the only reason Biden would pick a black women is because of the “current moment” instead of her own qualifications and personality. This idea that black people advance because of their blackness is blatant racism and we deal with it every day!

Trump says Biden is 'against God and he's against guns' - BBC News  via
is biden not a narcissist?
Cognitive Decline? An Alarming Look at Joe Biden  via
Biden apparently thinks every black person was brought over on a boat
US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
Wrong! Biden directed the place to make them available but there was a National Security concern.
Biden was accused ( after being VP for 8 yrs without being accused) &amp; there wasn’t any back up. Trump has 45 sexual harassment allegations against him &amp; a woman fighting to get his DNA prior to the election. Clinton’s allegations came out after he was elected, but not ok
I’m supporting Joe Biden for president because he’ll be a steadfast advocate for our nation’s public school students and educators.   Will you pledge to support Joe, too?
If it's fair why use this as a stupid "gotcha?" We can't if people like you are lying about Biden and depressing turnout like "progressives" did in 2016, 2010 and 2000.
If you're looking for solutions you also don't start by saying Biden doesn't believe in policies he has already released or that "moderate" democrats are responsible for things the GOP did. The main thrust seems to be that we have Trump because Democrats didn't stop the GOP.
Now we know that no matter what we do it is never enough. Vote for Biden, good, but this "no excitement" talk is designed to hurt him and hurt Democrats. If you think that helps progress you're a damn fool.
Except that the Obama/Biden Administration brought the Economy back after Bush killed it. You want to explain that Donnie?
Biden has an aggressive climate change policy that he has already released. Democrats have been for "taxing the rich" my whole life! You live in a world of false conflict between moderates and progressives when the real conflict is Democrat versus Republican.
Which policies of biden's can you sell me on?Yes that’s if he resigned and Pence pardons him, if he doesn’t resign and loses the election and leaves when Biden takes over he is screwed.
He knows that if he loses and stays until Biden gets in. Him and the kids are going to jail, so resigning and getting pardons is what he will do
Sounds like Biden is ready to ditch the weak-ass public option and he's not even in office yet. The only way this nightmare election could be any funnier is if Trump had the balls to come out with his own M4A bill.
Ironic picture of #biden and #Harris considering #obama was eligibility to be President was also questioned.
Will Biden have the moral fortitude to deploy a tactical nuke, if need be? A real concern for anyone who cherishes liberty.
Biden runs on Alzheimer’s medicine
Can't wait for you to blame the storm on Biden and Harris
I will be voting in person just so there’s no excuses.When it goes 75% Biden 25% Trump,he still probably will not throw in the towel,we will probably have to burn down the White House.
I'm sure the Biden/Harris administration will find a way to bail them out without any benefit for the public. Isn't her brother-in-law the head lawyer for Uber?
I’ll start by stating this clearly: In November I’ll be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.  Now I’ll add that: The Biden/Harris ticket disgusts me.  And: I have nothing good or positive to say about the Biden/Harris ticket.
My fucking lord CNN is trash. Three times this morning now they've asked if the Biden/Harris ticket is too far to the left.
I am so glad that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris!!  She will make a great vice-president!!❤️
I am so happy the Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.  It’s about time that a strong, intelligent, woman of color be picked to serve as vice-president of the United States.  Trump supporters send your hate elsewhere, you’re going to lose in November.
Bishop Tobin excommunicates Joe Biden, apparently.
She was the best LOOKING black woman. Sounds shallow but Biden likes attractive females+he knows sex sells. America loves attractive people. Most of those people don't have a clue what's going on.
Get ready for Biden/Harris to dance on your political grave.
Tom Cotton? Tucker Carlson? Trump Jr? Mask-off Biden?
Awesome! I guess if u are a very attractive black lady u can really move up the ladder fast! Biden+company knows this of course...)
Oh, I'm sure he's voting for Biden. I didn't say I wasn't voting for him, however, he will be my LAST choice on my ranked choice voting ballot here in Maine. I know my first two choices won't garner the required votes to be viable so my vote will trickle down to Biden..
Biden as nominee and Harris as VP was decided before the primaries even started. It’s fucking depressing
Totally.  And once Trump's campaign starts rolling out Harris attack ads, Biden's going to see a drop from pulling Harris onto the ticket.  Between her terrible debate performances, and her pitiful questioning during the Kavanaugh hearings, she'll be an anchor on the ticket.
Hahahahahaahah Biden picked a cop.   My vote means little in MA but my goodness what a horrible VP pick. There’s literally clips of her calling out his racist policy on debate stage
TBH, I was rooting for Susan Rice, but Kamala was a close 2nd...in makes sense in terms of competencies, as she knows domestic policy, while Biden knows foreign policy very well. Rice has great creds in foreign policy, none in domestic, &amp; not as energizing as KH!
We need to turn out in November.  Trump will try to steal the election if it is close.   If we are lucky enough to have a Biden win, Nov 4 we fight for #MedicareForAll #tytarmy
yeah, that's what's frustrating.  The MA teachers unions are still saying they won't do it.  whatever.....Let's go Biden/Harris!!!
Wouldn't quite call Biden unbeatable at this point. They still have a lot of work to do. Fingers crossed they do it. #VPPick
Biden has made a VP pick. Hopefully we find out who it is before November. #joebidenvp
he's definitely going to replace Pence after he sees how much press Biden gets from his pick
I'd say the corporate media. They're also responsible for making Mayor Pete a thing. And making Obama, Clinton, and Biden the Dem nominees. And pushing John fucking Kasich as a moderate alternative to Trump.
Did Biden remember to bring the kids to the left of the house.
"'You better watch out if Trump is reelected': Critics warn new executive orders will 'defund' Medicare and social security | The Independent"this to the DEMOCRATS in DC STOP SPREADING LIES ABOUT TRUMP OR FACE FACT CHECK!
All he does is make ads for the Lincoln project and the Biden campaign. Every single day, several times a day....
I meant in 2016. I don't think Biden could've won then either.
Yes, Obama was also an unoffensive neoliberal, it was peak great recession, and he could've easily lost still if McCain didn't pick Sarah Palin as VP. I think Biden can win this one because we're in a similarly trainwrecky position and he's similarly inoffensive (to media elites)
Personally I'm dreading the debates. I thought Biden did terribly in the Democratic debates. He IS a gaffe machine. I think it's gonna be ugly.
Are you kidding me , you are a fool if you think any of us would vote Blue, oh you are a fool your voting for Biden
HEY, Luka is getting a little love...this play+the layup video. But not on the up+coming star list? As J.Biden always says..."come on man".
It's so hard to believe how anyone could vote Biden...really...I know people just hate Trump but "come on" we're talking about being President. What s best 4 the country. The rich celebrities+sports stars don't care. They're protected+taken care 4, 4 life. #trump2020
The economy that Trump brags about was built by Obama and Biden...TRAITOR Trump had absolutely nothing to do with building the economy...It was great when Putin put him in office..!
That hope evaporated pretty quickly. Biden will bring a sense of normalcy, but unfortunately that "normalcy" is the status quo that brought us Trump, so it's just a matter of time before the next nightmare begins in 2024....
does not have the power to do this. Taxes are supposed to be regulated by a representative Congress elected by the people. We can’t vote a constitutional menace for another four more years. Vote Joe Biden for President #Biden2020
"U.S. intel: Russia trying to hurt Biden, but China, Iran don't want Trump"
So hopefully China helps out Biden as much as Russia is helping Trump then
Never Trump = Joe Biden!!!! Why would any level headed Republican want that! If we lose the White House we are screwed for not only the next 4 yrs but i am sure it will be even longer! #VoteTrump2020Joe Biden wants to see that nipple.
I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Biden and Harris followed with him.
We will after Biden is elected and Democrats win the Senate.
How can anyone justify voting for Biden who has major elderly obvious problems.  Elder abuse poor man .  Should be age limits for politicians.  Disgusting
This nasty woman says BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
I don't know if the eye thing is due to dementia. Still, the choice between Biden with maybe-dementia and a raging malignant narcissist is easy.  I'm not diagnosing Trump either but he always talks and acts that way.
Thank you for pointing out so well how inept Joe Biden is.
Kamal called Biden a racist and believed his accusers... look further into him also
Wasn't Joe Biden told he had to choose a woman of color in order to get support from the black community? I mean it's not like he vetted candidates of all races, and chose Kamala because he believed she is the best person for the job. This is pandering at its finest.
If undecided, Pelosi will be interim president... their plan all along... it was never Biden/Harris, that was a smokescreen..
Alright Jonathan. What about taxes? Biden has shown his, should Trump also show his? Biden has laid out what he’d do with the next four years, should Trump do that as well? Biden doesn’t owe the media anything, although if we’re comparing the two, let’s be fair.
⁦ corrects yesterday’s Post piece:  the increasing acceptance of the Far Right has severely skewed where the center lies: Biden and Harris are far closer to the ideological center than the Left.  Kamala Harris exposes the GOP’s radicalism
So uh, I assume you're gonna ask Biden and Harris some tough questions too right?
Biden was in the Senate many years, made two presidential bids, and served honorably as VP.  Oddly enough, after so many years, the time is right for him as President and he’s right for the time we’re in. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
He is too stupid to understand that or maybe not stupid I just think he can’t remember Joe Biden for president is a mistake that this country would make if they elect him and his vice president is 10 times worse than where are at today
Please vote for Biden. People’s lives depend on it.
The wicked witch of the west on the Wizard of Oz! Gave me nightmares! 😂   Now it’s Biden, Kamala, Pelosi, and Schumer!
Ya right! Obama help Israel? Biden in his forgetful stupor forgets that:  1: Obama kept Prime Minister Netanyahu  waiting. Didn’t want to meet with him  2: Obama colluded in Israel election trying to get vote to go against Netanyahu. Obama did what he accused Russia of doing here
Me when biden announced it ha!!🤣🤣

Vote for Biden!!!
You cant make this stuff up, it wooldnt be believed...
If Biden is the candidate that most aligns with your values, then it was a wise primary vote for you. Personally, I value healthcare, social justice, corporate accountability, etc...
Kamala: Ebola was not a pandemic! Obama &amp; Biden, during SARS ordered testing to stop! Why? Didn’t want high numbers released to us during election cycle! Sick of Democrats lying and treasonous activities! STOP LYING!
Well, he's white.  I don't recall any birtherism bs about HRC or Biden either.  You would think his blatant racism would be enough to vote him out, but apparently 50% or more of Americans are also racist.
Not true. Now do Biden..
Many great state-school grads!  "if he is the 1st [non-Ivy] to be elected president in ~6 decades, we expect him to grab a shovel &amp; keep on digging. Having an #education secretary who actually believes in public education would be a good place to start."
Don’t blame you.  I’d wait until Biden is sworn in to open.
I say fu Biden and your head Queen partner
I get it. No one is happy with me about it (wife included). I promised myself early on that Id vote for any candidate other than Biden or Bloomberg. I refuse to accept that we have to be basic b’s in America with a 2 party system. The dem platform just doesn’t speak to me anymore
Her words and behavior? Thats the qualifications? Ok..Now do Biden...
History is filled with great leaders making alliances with former rivals.  Woodrow Wilson picking William Jennings Bryan for Secretary of State.  JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  Eisenhower and Earl Warren.  Despots kill rivals.  Great leaders form alliances.  Biden - Harris.
Everything he’s accusing Biden of Trump is guilty of! This is beyond pathetic! What a joke!
No. He’s Biden, which is waaaaaay worse
It’s a Biden boat parade!
I had tears listening to both Biden and Harris .. they weee so refreshing
Krystal and Saagar: 538 Models Echo 2016, Cornel West Calls Biden-Harris...  via
How about you put this on your TelePrompTer! Get this through your lying brain. Biden has no brain left to get this through. He can’t even read it and get it right.
As long as the mainstream media parrots it back (you know they won’t challenge him) both Biden and Harris will continue to lie or just make stuff up.
IMO, at that stage, he can be dragged off to the side in all of his insanity and stashed away in a locked room until Biden's term begins. Nobody will care and most will be relieved.
Like Trump said. She’s a nasty woman! Tell it like it is!  I’m sure Biden thought that after her attacks on him during the Primaries!
Has America not been lied too enough by the Democrats? Wake up people!  Compare Kamala statements about Biden before and now! LIAR!  She’s called a moderate? Are you kidding me? Not one Democrat should be elected. Is it possible 50% of Americans are stupid enough to believe them?
How about you and you’re Ilk apologize to Joe and Jill Biden for the scurrilous and unfounded claims leveled at him by you and  on behalf of Tara Reade and we’ll call it even Krystal? A cold day in hell? That’s what I thought.
Kampala Harris has been a great pick as VIP with Biden. She really brings a lot to the campaign! People love her!   Yup! All 3% of those who voted for her during the Primary! 😂   By the way, she’s not African American. Get that straight!
One Thing to rule them all and in the darkness Biden
Huh, the news media shows Biden, but not Trump. #Biasnews?
If moving left is what you’re actually worried about (hint: we know you’re racist) imagine  how awesome it would have been for Biden to have picked Warren... your head would have exploded!  If only...

Kamala Harris ENDS Joe Biden's Campaign OVERNIGHT By Simply Being Picked...  via
Biden can read and won’t eliminate intelligence briefings. He would’ve had an immediate, appropriate response to C-19. Anyone who is ok with putting their health, safety &amp; security in the hands of this incompetent Putz is just as mentally ill as he is. You’re sad.
Yes.  Historically bad.  Take a look at record, her own view of Joe Biden during the primary run...
And despite the intersectional impact of racism and sexism on Black women, they are the nation’s most reliable champions for universal rights for all groups. They are keenly aware that all forms of oppression disproportionately affect Black women;
Isn't Biden Catholic???
Don't worry, when Henry isn't posting racist stuff about Kamala, he's posting about Hunter Biden conspiracies in Ukraine.  Seems like a real straight shooter.
Yea, just like Hillary right? Why are you guys so naive. Biden isn't winning shit Its obvious they control the narrative Trump is winning by a landslide. So many people were democrats and after this whole blm antifa shit they've come out and stated they will vote for Trump.
“As a president I think trump lacks professionalism and has made a lot of mistakes but he is infinitely better than Joe Biden. “
The energy, optimism and excitement surrounding Biden picking Kamala Harris reminds me a lot of when Trump picked Pence.
And if you can’t comprehend that Tara Reade is a liar, there is no way for me to help you. It’s Biden or Trump, and any other choice helps Trump. Sorry to break it to you.
I don’t like Joe that much either, but you have two choices: Biden or Trump, and any vote NOT for Biden is a vote for Trump. You need to comprehend that. Refer to my earlier tweet about 2 party systems and FPTP voting.
Honestly, I’m not thrilled that the democratic ticket is Biden/Harris. I really wish Bernie would have been the nominee. BUT. I will happily support Biden &amp; Harris if it means getting rid of the joke we currently have in office.
You’re absolutely right. Knowing it’s the Biden/Harris ticket, it will be Trump in a landslide.
I donated to Biden-Harris
Ok, let's do this!! First Black woman and Caribbean/Asian American on a major party ticket! No matter how you feel about her, just take some time to take in this historic moment. #WOC #represent
oh goody, a cop. you really had to pick a fucking cop. good on you, Biden.
I genuinely think that this pick strengthens the ticket. It take a very niche kind of person to get pushed from Biden to Trump at this point.
Lots of fodder for the Republican Party to work with!  Does she still think Biden is a racist?
Let’s Go.
Warren would have been a better choice but I’m gonna vote for Biden no matter what. Was hoping one nice thing could happen in a maelstrom of insanity, but alas, no. Just get this year done with already...
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
Like this pick - she was my top choice for President! Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November -
Alright, BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!  #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpDepression #TrumpVirus #WeWantJoe
She could be your next president if Biden ever got elected.
What if Biden is announcing a large portion of his cabinet with the VP announcement?! That would be great!
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
It’s going to be a woman of color. You can guarantee that. Biden’s camp doesn’t want to be fielding questions for the next 3 months on why, out of all the qualified WOC, he decided to go with the status quo. It would be suicide.
Biden’s main consideration, all along, has been for his VP to be someone who he trusts, is ‘Simpatico’ with, and someone who could slip into the job, if needed, on day 1. Foreign policy is a main consideration for the former Foreign Relations Comittee chairman, just a thought.
I was just thinking today about when  started to enter the conversation of those being considered for VP. Early on, she was not even mentioned and then all of the sudden her name began to drop in talks. I think this was strategic on the part of the Biden campaign.
Shouldn’t it be “Confused You Know the Things for Joe Biden”
Biden Suggests Trump's Coronavirus Vaccine Won't Be Safe
I have a feeling today is the day! I’d like him to also name a few Cabinet picks, Go Team Biden!
Ahhh, so this is why the polls have gotten closer. Quality pollsters are waiting until Biden picks his VP, so we’ve only been looking at crap polls!
I plan on renewing and upping my weekly contribution to the Biden campaign through Election Day, and start donating to the DSCC through this campaign season. If we take back the White House, but not the Senate, all our hard work will have been in vain.
I never ceases to be amazed at the depths of stupidity these Trumpers can go to. Just when I thought Lysol ingestion was it, Trump went to Biden is out to hurt God, then I hear this. It makes flat earth preachers look like geniuses compared to the biker group.
Ok.    Assuming you’re right, and it’s not just something he’s saying to placate centrists, what’s another viable option?    I want to know, because I’m not so much a Biden supporter as I am a “Get Donny Out” supporter.
And what chance do those policies have of becoming reality in a Trump administration?  Wouldn’t they have a better chance of happening under Biden?
How will our aims be achieved with a second Trump administration?     If we gain control of Congress to pass M4A (for example) could you honestly see it being vetoed by Biden?
Even Robin Williams was on to Biden. #Trump2020 #MAGA2020
You mean like Biden or Obama?
You're unbelievably foolish comment about impeaching Joe Biden shows just how corrupt the current Republican party is. Also,  just stupid.  I mean you're intelligent yet you have to do this play acting as an anti-intellectual and to say stupid s*** to fit in.
I don’t understand.  How does attacking Biden help in removing Trump from office?    Isn’t that the immediate goal?
Yeah...  watch 11:15-12:24. Still voting for Biden no matter who he picks, but this is not my favorite take on police reform and allocation of funding.
In keeping with new Washington tradition, The Biden Running Mate.
All those things we know from her running 4 president..also consider joe biden crime bill that he wrote
None of the liberal media call out Biden for only making scripted remarks. Zero credibility
This is what Biden did do when faced with a pandemic: #WalkAway #Trump2020 #TrumpLandslideVictory
How did Susan rice do in the primaries..what we know, we are here cause everyone not named Biden lost.
I think Biden brought her to Delaware and is building up her name in order to help her in Michigan and for future endeavors. The actual choice has probably already been made, and kept very much under wraps. It’ll be a WOC, and deservedly so.
Joe biden said "She can have any role she wants".... then he's gon do this to her?
This is true. But remember how Trump got the nomination, with 35% of the Republican vote. If the moderates can coalesce around a ‘Biden’ like the D’a did around Bernie’s leftism, they can beat back another Trumpist.
1. There is no way he wrote this "apology." 2. There is no way he remembers what he said even 5 minutes ago. 3. There is a pattern of Biden's gross, racist statements.

My 2 republican uncles and aunt who are tired of Trump told me last week that they would vote for Biden if he picked harris. Would write in someone else if he picked rice. They think rice is hillary part 2 and  that she lied about benghazi...Shes too hawkish. ..
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
You are all racists  Joe Biden is goin to win in November ... 2nd place!
To the Biden Campaign: If you support what God says is sin then you are against God.   Duh!
I had those very thoughts. How you think so do you write. No way Biden wrote the explanation.   So as he speaks, so will he write. Birripbirripbirrip, “that’s all folks.”  For those of you who weren’t around, look up Porky Pig! 😂
He isn’t talking about the culture , but political views , he didn’t say all black people are the same Hence “notable exceptions”  This is what Trump wants you guys to believe smh hear Biden’s statementTrump could've had a good news day with the Mid-East deal, but he just couldn't stop insulting women. AOC, Kamala, Mika, Nancie. I doubt Trump negotiated the deal.  Sure he probably told Pompeo to "go do this for me" but fact is UAE and Isreal got it done for themselves. #biden

I’m sorry, at this point, if someone is trying to run as a third or more candidate for president THIS year, they are a colossal, self-centered  dick, who cares nothing about this Country. This year, every single person who isn’t for Trump, needs to climb the eff behind Biden!Trump absolutely is a hate-filled person. Every pathetic insult and name he gives is evidence of that.

THIS is the best add against DJT period it goes after the biggest con he sold to America. The man is a business failure and destroys everything he touches not related to entertainment.  Obama and Biden left a great economy he destroyed it with pure stupidity and ignorance.
This is so whack! Smh. Media can attack the president on the daily. Barfin up falls BS. Then on the flip side this sh** happens?
For example they started planning on setting Hillary to be the nominee right after Obama was re-elected. Had no idea how involved it is in pre-determining who should run and win.

The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.

Chairman Biden and emperor's Harris will be right at home with the CCP.They've already started using some of the policies of Chairman Mao Zedong. Next thing they'll have the gov. to start distribution of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedongs little Red Book . We're in for it
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.
the FBI  attorney that falsified documents to spy on Trump is making a deal with the Fed's in order to get a lesser sentence.  A "chain" is only as strong as its weakest link. If I was Obama-Biden I would start looking for a good attorney because you'll need one.
Yes voter disenfranchisement is a problem. However the reason people don't vote is because they think both parties are the "same" which is a lie meant to suppress young people from voting. If a young person can't tell the difference between Biden and Trump then the lie worked.

Biden said the travel ban was xenophobic and he wouldn’t have closed the borders. Democrats advocated large crowds for Chinese New Year, they still advocate for large crowds and rioting? How would you have prevented it? Locking it up for marijuana possession?
We can’t have it both ways. We can’t say Biden can’t remember his own name AND plagiarized something from 30 years ago. He isn’t writing his speeches or they’d read “C’mon man! This is um um um how the hell did I get p-p-pudding in my knig-nig-knickers?! K-K-K-Kamala man!”

Susan Rice made the most sense for Biden’s VP Pick, but my money says Susan Rice is one of the names that’s going to be torched by Durham and they didn’t want the controversy. Obviously I don’t KNOW that, but I truly believe she will be scapegoated.
They've already started.  I've read that she can't be president many times on here in the short time since Biden picked her for VP....it's pathetic.  Same thing they did to Obama
Could anyone get sucked off this good?! I was waiting for the money shot. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Is this what we have to look forward to? This R the type of questions asked of Biden or Harris? When it comes to Trump the media wants to bare knuckle brawl. What happened to journalism?
Biden needs to back to the basement.

What do you Hannity groupies think is behind his recent, obviously conscious, decision to refer to Biden and Obama by their first names -- and now Harris. Just really peculiar. Any theories?
I didn't listen to your dang cause I assumed it wasn't about me. Lol I mean I hate Joe Biden and Kamala Harris but I don't think Bernie's a sell out he's doing what he believes is right just as I am voting for those assholes.
Can someone please shut up  ? She’s bat shit crazy
This is like kind of unacceptable. Have you lived through the same last 3.5 years I have? If you have then I ask... ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. Get it together.
The only thing you said that is true is 150,000 people have died which is pretty aweful but would have been at least double thay number if Trump hadn’t have stopped flights in from China in late January which, btw, Biden called, wait for it... racist!
I think if Biden gets Ohio &amp; GA he got ME-2.
Biden,  Harris  soon will be advocating incarceration and fines for failure to conform  with society. They were worried that Trump would be dictating as he sat in the OVAL office. But it turns out that its been the democrats all along. Its up to us to stop them
Biden,  asked America for a national mask wearing. But while requesting this they weren't wearing a mask. Hypocrisy coming from hypocrites
The existence of the electoral college makes all the voting discourse hilarious to me. Biden is winning my state regardless of what I do.
That’s about all Joe Biden’s brain can do is generate enough power to make them go three steps
Woah you are not about to say that when Joe Biden's campaign is literally vote for me because I'm not Trump. Like my fucking God the irony. I'm voting for that piece of shit but you guys need to stop acting like he isn't shit and is god's gift to Progressives and the left
Oh how quickly people forget, in 2008 this Country was a total mess and Obama and Biden came into a mess. They fixed General Motors, Wall Street, housing mortgage problems. They got us out of a disaster that once again the Republicans got us into. Kamala did much for CA
That’s a big fat lie and you know it. Never did She ever accused Biden of such things!
I can’t wait to see you campaigning. I see the Smiling side of you and it’s Sweet, now I want to see The Stern side as we elect the Biden Harris Presidency. (Put your seat belt on)
If Bernie and Warren are at fault for anything, it was not having a plan pre-primary for how to still unify when things inevitably get tough and heated, or when one of them has a heart attack while the other just passed Biden in the polls in the same week.
Thing I’ve been telling myself to deal with the fact there was every logical reason to pick Warren: A Biden to Warren admin would never be the Warren presidency she or we wanted bc she wouldn’t have the mandate of being elected on her own platform. She’s free to be herself.
, no matter how she got to the top, some say that she had affairs with her boss. That's up for debate. But the fact that she's here is a threat to the way of life as we know it if Joe Biden gets elected. Higher taxes, open borders, and everything else. #KAG

So now because Biden picked Harris.  the unemployment rate must have dissolved all these people are getting kicked out of their homes must still have their homes. Just don't think that is the most important thing facing our country. Congress get back to work.
Wait a minute, are you implying you don’t think old white men should be running the country and in order to stand up against old white men running the country you’re going to vote for Biden? An old... white... man...? Slow clap

Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
"Biden and Harris remember Beau Biden in their first remarks together as running mates"
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.
If Joe Biden is elected will God need to get Secret Service protection?

A whole speech and not one mention of bleach, I don’t think Biden can pull this off
I’ll admit Trump’s treatment of women is deplorable and disgusting and there’s no room for it anywhere in this world. Can you say the same about Biden? Will you condemn him for it?
Tune in to Biden/Harris on MSNBC and watch how a REAL President acts.
You missed the point. I’m not defending Trump, I’m implying you’re a hypocrite. Biden may not have as many accusations, but he has them too. My money says you’ll have no problem voting for Biden though, which makes you a hypocrite.
Wow, Biden is boring and Trump is destroying Biden in followers.  Good to know. Biden is second in another category.
Let's skip the debate with presidential candidates because you're worried people might figure out Biden is deranged.  I'm not a Trump fan and I can tell you don't want a debat because Trump would eviscerated Biden.  Just come out of your echo chamber and admit you lost already.

For how stupid the Biden campaign is, I actually totally believe it. Though if Biden has stronger convictions he wouldn’t let a gaffe get in the way of course of going for substantive change.
So we lost having an eventual president that believes in single payer, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation and an overhaul of Washington corruption and Wall St because Biden made another stupid gaffe. Big structural wtf.

If Joe Biden becomes president then Hillary Clinton will call in a suicide strike on Joe Biden. I can see it now, it will be labeled as an overdose that was brought on by dementia and just for good measure he will have shot himself 3 times in the back of the head.
Dude w the Biden shirt wants new blood and a king... confused much?

Jim Polito Daily Poll: How will Kamala Harris impact the Biden campaign?
Trump clearly has dementia. He can't complete a sentence. Biden does not have dementia and has served in the senate and as VP with no problems. You are delusional if you think tRump and his adolescent tactics are going to work this time around. He's losing his base.
Innocent thought? There’s nothing innocent about hiding the DNC elected leader has full blown dementia. If they cared about the country they’d pick a different candidate. Biden the politician is dead and Trump’s the coroner who will call his TOD. Just like he did with US politics
Does this guy even know that his dislike for President Trump and voting for Biden will lead to the socialization and open borders of our Country? I remember when he used to be a solid conservative as a congressman.  #FoxNews
You must feel so dirty when you tweet about Joe Biden knowing that he has dementia and he’s a pedophile. If I were you I would start praying for absolution now.
Biden stands a decent chance of winning now that he's kissed the ring on the k-hive. Which is great for me because now he DEFINITELY doesn't need my vote! I can write in Yang or cast it for Howie Hawkins without losing any sleep. Honestly this shit was over for me months ago.
It wasn’t because she was being courteous or whatever to Warren, that was some bs. Biden had it in the can and she was just playing the field as she does.
If Biden didn’t have the courage to stand up to Wall St and make her VP he won’t have it to make her secretary of treasury.

Yea he's quick, and aggressive. I get not liking what comes out of his mouth but Biden can't run on the fly. There were moments in the primary debates where Biden just took punches and didn't respond. I wouldn't debate him if I was Biden. Let Trump's Twitter ruin him.
How is Biden a pedo?
I’m old enough to remember when Kamala called Biden a racist.
Not to insert myself into the national conversation. But you have to wonder if Joe Biden would have chosen differently if Elizabeth Warren had bothered to be on the Bax &amp; O’Brien Show. I say no. But maybe I’m just being too modest.
He got my ass but he isn’t a sexual predator like Biden is right?

If Biden wins, I see Susan Rice as Sec. of State. A powerful figure with international gravitas.
Let's go, Biden/Harris!
One word: Benghazi. It’s irrational, but I think it would have ultimately hurt us. I really do like her though, and I’m sure there’s a place for her elsewhere in the Biden Administration!
Wow. Nice pick Joe.
I'd be tweeting more about Harris, but for the #mapoli Chernobyl we're living through, except to say politically Biden won't lose votes with Harris, which is frankly the only consideration. Nobody would gain him more. Harris will be fine.
Harris, now the American people will hear why the both of you haven't condemned the violence that's plagues all the major cities. Not one democratic leader has spoken up against the violence.  WE'LL SEE AND HEAR YOU ABOUT THE VIOLENCE
Biden and DNC tried to make Kamaal step aside for Susan Rice, but Kamala would not back down. Points to Kamala for standing her ground.
Now would be a great time to make a donation to the Biden/ Harris campaign!!!!!
Biden Promised VP to Kamala to drop out of Primary, but then made Kamala beg to be VEEP?
Congratulations Kamala Harris! America needs a winning team in November! Biden-Harris 2020!
Harris is just the third woman to be picked as a vice-presidential candidate for a major party's ticket.
Biden had the difficulty of picking not only a running mate but also the likely future nominee. Excellent choice. Harris has the federal experience, AG of California, US senator. She can stand on her own, debate anyone.
Biden reveals Senator Kamala Harris will be his running mate for the election.
Joe "Shoot 'em in the legs" Biden &amp; Off. Kamala Harris. Of course. Totally on-brand.
I cried I was so happy!! Biden/Harris 2020 Unbeatable!!
So does this mean Biden made Mayor Pete fly all the way out to Delaware to tell him he didn’t get the job?
I don't think Biden will do well with Trump on stage. He can only hold so much information in his head before he jumbles the words together.
It was my dream ticket back when she was still on the debate stage attacking Biden. She has the federal experience, was AG of California, US Senator. She's young and strong. Biden had the burden of picking a running mate and possibly the future president.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
I truly don’t know who Biden could’ve picked for VP to strengthen his case but I would prob guess Sanders due to the ideas and following he’d bring. But picking the “token black person” despite recognizing she been against her own people her whole career is so misguided
Sen.  is just the third woman — and first African American — to be nominated for vice president by a major political party.
Yes Dr. Biden!!
Now that is Slow Biden has picked his running mate Kabbalah Harris, we will now see all of the trash about her coming out and how much of a terrible prosecutor she was, but Joe can’t remember all of that he’s lucky if he can remember how to tie his shoes.
The quicker people realize that Dems and Reps are the same people with different names, the quicker we’d make progress lol. I knew they didn’t care about Trump being re-elected as soon as they strong-armed the primaries towards Biden
They should just flip the ticket and have Kamala be president and Biden be VP
Dump the whole US into a bag of rice.. Biden chose Kamala Harris as her running mate for this years elections.....

Bernie could have gotten behind Warren when she had surpassed Biden (which Bernie never managed to do) and had a heart attack at the same time. Instead he fought back for nothing.
Even if Warren had dropped earlier Bernie still wouldn’t have won because the majority of her supporters that Bernie hadn’t already peeled off from her didn’t have Bernie as a 2nd choice. At that point she was taking more votes from Biden. Move the fuck on.

Biden finds himself pulled off-message by self-inflicted mistakes - Axios
Exactly. No one should “settle for Biden” we shouldn’t have to “settle” for that. There’s other people running that people don’t pay attention to that are independents and aren’t racist and pedos.
I heard Joe Biden called God a bad hombre. The worst hombre. Also he hates energy, whatever the fuck that means
Anybody who goes along with this in the admin should be prosecuted under the Anti-deficiency Act by Biden's DOJ.
Haha not Biden being racist again, surprise surprise- not.
Another legacy of the biden crime bill
Biden has gone too far this time. I heard the other day he called god a chump and challenged him to an arm wrestling competition. God told TMZ that he “can’t even” right now.
I have kids who's future is my primary interest in voting, and another 4 years of Trump is a far worse proposition than 4 or less of Biden. Minority groups, especially minority families have too much at stake to blow these things off because a candidate isn't ideal

Biden clarifies comments on diversity in African American community  via  idk how he does it
The best part was Biden’s own clarification. I just wanted to clarify! When I said that racist comment, I didn’t say that racist comment. Literally that was the entire clarification. Right.but we just don't hear or rarely see Joe Biden..?  Hmm.
That would be garish. Biden doesn’t need superficial stuff like that. He’s the real deal.  #TrumpPandemicFailure #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden has sent me roughly 300 emails in the past 12 years and not a single one can tell me where to get my Biden/Harris 2020 bumper sticker.
Hunter Biden is irrelevant. Ivanka &amp; Jared have earned big bucks working in the WH. #MostCorruptAdministrationEver #TraitorTrump #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
Since Biden has the yips, a 2 foot putt is no gimme for Joe.   Dan, do you recall Obama rolling gutter balls &amp; throwing balloons on Opening Day.  Trump doesn’t have the yips. He throws strikes, doesn’t plagiarize, air edited tapes, or spy on opponents.  So who’s the cheat, Dan?
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden  Meaningless unless she can hit sliders &amp; curveballs.
Agreed. That's why we're voting for Biden/Harris.

$400,00,000,To defeat Joe Biden making slow Joe
I love Joe Biden’s strong leadership condemning the violence and looting of ANTIFA and pledging to stop it in its tracks!
Yeah pretty much all police-related institutions will be pro Trump.  how do you think the elections going to pan out when every cop in the country is out stumping for Trump. But biden is leading in the polls...
No you're not , you had the opportunity and the votss in 2008 and you didn't pass it then.   even if you take the Senate and by some miracle Joe Biden beats Trump in the election you still won't get Medicare for all past because it's a bad idea and even Nancy pelosi knows it.
White mfers really be mad that people don't like Biden. Yeah it's easy for you guys to say you want the "safe moderate" option because you don't NEED drastic change. Because Biden didn't say you're not white if you dont vote for him and Kamala didn't mass incarcerate ur people.
Saving American democracy?? you people gotta relax, take deep breaths in the nose &amp; out the mouth, and realize Biden is NOT THE ENEMY.

In Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington, mailboxes are being removed. In Arizona, the GOP is encouraging mail-in ballots. This is an overt attempt to disenfranchise Biden supporters.      #SaveTheUSPS #ImpeachTrumpAgain
It’s really funny seeing someone get so defensive over Trump who is legitimately ALL of the things they refer to Biden as. I also worry they truly think that’s how you spell sexist...?
Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
Of course he did. He's afraid to go to jail if he loses his Presidency (refer to the Articles of Impeachment earlier this year). Vote Biden or else we can see a dictatorship in the near future.
Can the same be said for the Biden campaign?
So why is that the fate of Social Security became more tenuous after 8 years of Obama-Biden?

is failing on the job and also in his attempt to make Joe Biden look old, tired, and sleepy. Trump is the candidate who,not only appears to be getting senile and clumsy in his gate ,but also slurring a d mispronouncing simple words in most people's lexicon. Loser
but then, the DP  'suppressed' the vote by changing and discarding SANDERS' votes to name Biden as the nominee.
I think a Harris/Biden administration will likely double the impact.
Biden/ Trump debate-  Trump- Man! Biden - Woman! Trump - CAMERA  Biden - TV!!! I cede my time
“We’re not gonna let the Biden/Harris campaign cut America’s meat!” No need to snip the tip, I suppose.
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.
Biden has no Clue
Amazingly, Brett Samuels at The Hill  says Biden didn’t call for a national mask mandate

Anything that keeps Biden from sniffing kids is ok with me.
Next up: We've never seen Biden eat citrus fruit: Could he have scurvy?
If the person was smart, honest, and sharp I wouldn't care if they were 78. I have known people in their 90's that I would trust with that power and responsibility.  Biden however, is not smart, he never was. He's corrupt, and is suffering from rapid cognitive decline.
Meaning....Biden &amp; Harris will bring the backing of science &amp; education &amp; leadership once again to the country.
this is a controversial opinion but i dont actually think trump has a chance at being reelected. i know biden is worthless but i dont think it even matters at this point
The idea of trusting Andrew Yang to deliver an unprecedented comprehensive civilizational overhaul for the U.S. economy, government, and society, but then second-guessing him on a 2020 Biden endorsement is just . . .
It sure is!  In January, Biden and Harris will begin the difficult task of repairing all the damage you did.  They'll work hard to fight Trump Virus, not ignore it like you do.  166,000 deaths!
None. At least Biden can read complete sentences. The Trump cannot conplete a sentence even reading it.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done more harm to minorities than Donald Trump ever has.

If Biden loses, the moderate few will not supplant the extremist many; the rhetoric of the DLC will not trump the policies of the DNC. If Trump loses, the RNC will cut its losses; Republicans will then campaign as “conservatives,” and govern like Romney, Ryan, and Rubio.

"In picking the California senator, Biden couldn’t be clearer that his will be an administration dedicated to shoring up a crumbling status quo." -  +
Black and elderly people are disproportionately impacted by the removal of letter boxes and shutdown of post offices. Both of these demo graphs largely poll for Biden and have historically been redistricted to suppress their ability to vote. So, no. It doesn't effect both equally
Wish I lived in one of those areas. Unfortunately I'm in Biden country lol.
Senator, you should be reminded that destroying any of your documents is a felony.   Seems to me that you are ALL in on defeating joe Biden because you are ALL in with a foreign adversary’s intend to keep a corrupt administration in power. You are dirty, sir. When did you turn?
Heck yeah!  #SaveTheUSPS #SaveThePostOffice #resist
Just a reminder to #DefundThePolice  Clip:  Full episode here:
Was just looking in the replies of  news sources about trumps brother’s death....and have to say the amount of people praising it is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING  I don’t like Biden but when his son died I felt terrible about the whole situation. Y’all really need to check yourselves.
Name that comes up often in Biden Ukraine search is  - for yrs now appears to be blatantly telling MSM not to cover it. Something not adding up if they are that nervous.
Have we cured AIDS since 1980? Is there a vaccine? Yet for Covid we should have one already? This would be over if Biden were president? He has a better plan? A Mask Mandate- Really. So Masks first, quell the riots (cure AIDS) &amp; restore the economy. So easy! And not at all dumb!
The Biden campaign has used this pandemic to attempt to cancel fair presidential debates. Biden has used the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to blame on Trump and portray himself as the only economic savior of this country. Think again about who is taking advantage..
Why no questions to our possible next president?   What are they hiding?   Biden has dementia and even if elected he won’t be running our country the deep state corrupt actors will be running us.    Soros will be the president.
Good old Hussein is right about Biden’s ineptitude.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
Why is the media tolerating these rules of asking Biden no questions?
Every voter knows why there was a snap recession.  We are not in a depression.  It’s whether you choose to believe Joe fucking Biden is the guy or the guy who’s building it back as we speak.

These people aren't "Biden" voters. It's a good meme, decent propaganda...but they're anarchists. Some of the larger crowd will vote for him, but the ones scheming this stuff aren't any more likely to vote for him than Trump.
To paraphrase a mentally impaired man currently running for America's highest office, if you're still wondering whether you're going to vote for Biden or Trump then you ain't libertarian.
We need a leader like  in  pushing this agenda forward. #MadamVicePresident #Kamala #Biden #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #broadband
White guy spouting white privilege.    Check Your privilege and get to the end of the line.  Ps. Biden is a confirmed predator.
With Biden in charge it will be the real deal a bloody affair that "reasserts the global leadership of the USA" or some other Public Relations, bullshit  Trump said he wouldn't recognize an electoral loss prior to "winning" in  2016 so repeating the same thing is no surprise
had the nerve to say President Trump “coddles” terrorists.   What planet is this lunatic on?  You mean like give Iran $150M in cash plus much more.  😂 Just another LIE from Biden
Trump tried to regime change Venezuela, it was the kind of half assed effort that has put him at logger heads with John Bolton &amp; the Neocons, the same Neocons who now back Biden so it's not a wash &amp; you are downplaying the imperialism that Biden represents &amp; why Neocons back him
if anyone thinks this alone means trump is less bad than biden, as opposed to equally bad, you are a fucking idiot, frankly
Kamala said that she believes Biden is a sexually assaulter.

Weekend at Bernie’s —I mean Biden’s
Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements.
Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.

They are doing this to hide Biden. Look at the fire over here, and not our candidate who is “funny” to say the least.

Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough

You want us to believe that this happened six years ago but is just being publicized as Biden prepares to accept the Democratic nomination? Pathetic.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.

Since Biden has the yips, a 2 foot putt is no gimme for Joe.   Dan, do you recall Obama rolling gutter balls &amp; throwing balloons on Opening Day.  Trump doesn’t have the yips. He throws strikes, doesn’t plagiarize, air edited tapes, or spy on opponents.  So who’s the cheat, Dan?
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
If they supported Biden all he'd ever talk about is boater fraud.
Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.
In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. Jaime supports Joe .
I'm sure Obama will be pulling strings should Biden get elected.

Couple of things. There is no Trump-living silent majority. There is a Trump-loving loud minority though. If everyone convinces one person to vote for Biden this will be an ass kicking of biblical proportions.

No he got voted in because we were sick of liars like Obama and Biden.   Speaking as a real trump voter and and ex-democrat.
Yep, Don't show Biden and the non-existing policies.  Just "but Trump"  You could run a cardboard box against Trump and win.  Biden's team will most certainly lose.
You're both right 🙂 A third party vote is a vote Biden failed to earn that only functions to help elect Trump.   If you have no preference between Biden and Trump then feel free.
biden needs to heed it now
If Warren were to join a Biden administration, Pressley would almost certainly run in the special election, right? That’s why this is Joe’s best shot.

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.

Real world: woman sometimes have careers then families. Guys are not caring for these woman, they are left with no money, no homes, abused and embarrassed to talk about it!! This is America! Biden did not  care. I'm a survivor, Am I glad? A different story to tell
Here us another woman tragedy story. Your newborn child looses her father to heroin, FENTANYL coming accross our borders. I was shocked to hear she is given $500 a month to live on. Shocked! Woman and children first? Biden never gave it a thought!! Or did Obama!!
Its nice to be rich, you would know, but poor because you gave time to your children  only to have your husband run off with another woman? Then there is the guy who never married you.SSDI is what ya get and its NOT ENOUGH FOR WOMAN. Biden never cared in 6 years!!
In six years Biden did nothing for SSDI people earning low pay, ZERO raises in 6 yrs. WOMAN, once again are discriminated against! We are earning less, because we are home caring for children!!
Figuring a disability check is done by recent work, well that is discrimination to woman, we work great jobs for 30 yrs, take time for a family of 3, now an unexpected domestic violence tragedy leaves women earning the lowest rate, $10,000 per year? Biden did zero!
Biden did nothing for people like me disabled from domestic violence earning less than $10,000 per year, because I am a woman who took time off from a career, single mom I add. Trump cares. Biden has no heart for America just for Hunter!! Who made disability about recent work?
I send mail all the time. Nothing I have ever sent in United States took more than a week to get there. I sent something to my son Monday it got there Wednesday this week!! You need to spend less time singing and  time researching Biden You Tube Ukraine. That's Biden lawbreaking!
I imagine the argument is that there are people who want to defund the police who are still willing to vote for Biden and that's hypocritical (as if keeping Trump will help defund the police)

Obama Expresses Concerns That Biden Cannot Defeat Trump, Report - Conservative Brief
I just wanna be clear-Joe Biden could literally try to murder me and I would find a way to roll my comatose ass to the polls and vote for him on November 3rd.
Honest question; not criticizing or arguing: If the police unions had endorsed Biden, would we be having this conversation?  Note: I am *absolutely* voting for Biden 🇺🇸.
...and the  are in goosestep with the tyrant Trump. I’ll go with Biden thank you very much.
Prediction: if Biden gets elected (or if Trump doesn’t completely sabotage our election system), we are in for a run of 3–4 one-term presidents, each of whom runs on a “change” platform, and each of whom will be impeached at some point during that one term.
Done!  Thanks for the recommendation.

If Biden wins—which i seriously doubt—his legacy will be pulling back the country from the brink of fascism. He doesn’t need much more of one than that.
the only people with anything nice to say about Biden, or credit him with any political acumen at all, are the republicans who steamrolled the Obama administration for 8 years

If Biden wasn’t to old and senile to take some questions at a press conference then I’m sure it would be a disaster.  At least our president has the fortitude to take tough questions.  Hiding Biden... that’s your campaign.
They work as little as Joe Biden does.

Biden is an incompetent idiot who's not even fit to be a door greeter bc he would grope,grab or sexually assault women&amp;children. He's plagiarized other ppl's speeches&amp;writings. He's mentally unfit,period!! Insults Black ppl&amp;even called them N**gg**s!!
How can anyone possibly compare these two situations. To quote joe biden ( come on man )
Biden spews Muslim quotes&amp;totally takes them out of context,why? Because someone(Dem) told him what to say to gain favor with the Muslim community,stop listening to Dems they will get us all killed/in a war.
There wasn’t someone there from HuffPo to say, “Joe Biden, do you regret sniffing the hair of hundreds of American citizens? Thousands?”
Not working out for ya Mr.Johnson..Don't even try..See most republicans are not on your pathetic side anymore. Your enabling a criminal..Donald Trump. His political futurecis ratger bleak and dismal. Republicans have bailed..Your bashing of Biden are on deaf ears
But the other option is Trump/Pence. By saying idk, are you saying that you’d rather consider them instead? For me, I’m saying let’s get Biden Harris in office and hold them accountable. We have a far better chance there than with Trump.
With this coming election, it’s a game of lesser of two evils but it should really be who’s going to listen to their constituents regardless of their own beliefs. My hope is that with Biden/Harris, they show growth against their past actions and do what’s right for the people.

This has gotta be the 3rd or 4th poll today that I’ve seen with Biden in a double digit lead. Not ideal.
I ain’t voting for Cheeto Jesus, but the way these liberals build up sniff your hair Joe Biden and Copmala Harris is very off putting for me
All the times Kamala Harris criticized Joe Biden during the Democratic primary
My wife and I will be using mail in ballots forvthe first time..Biden all the way. We will then walk our ballots to our post office and sent off to be counted without your fucking interference.We will remove Dejoy and you on November 3 .Bank on it
WATCH: Nunes says Biden knew “damn well” about spying on Trump campaign |
They gotta go for the person that can do the dems business when biden needs to step dow.
Do I really need to list the issues of Hunter Biden?
I like that the Ed Markey video has a very brief bit acknowledging taking out Trump means moving on to fight Biden after.
President Obama and vice President Biden inherited the worst economy since the great depression they turn it around saves auto industry and Trump ruined it
Who cares? The Democrats conceded when they picked Biden. Everything after that is performance art. The campaign is stillborn but they’re carrying it to term anyway. That at least might get some Republican voter goodwill in a later election.
HUNTER BIDEN. Need I say more?  It sure seems like your defending/justifying someone who stole 1/2 million from a charity, just because she’s a woman.
It must have been really dumb because you don't look smart.  Anyone excited about Biden is not too smart. He was in office 45 years and all he did was put blacks in prison with his marijuana laws of the 80s he authored and his crime bill in 94. White old man dumb as a stump.
Unfortunately i knew this Bullshit was going to happen! Harris has a real dark history and to add insult to injury,the Black and Hispanic Community made it very clear that they are very upset with Biden using her as vice president! I hope he knows what he's doing! On tha real!!!
DONALD TRUMP AIN’T THE ONLY PROBLEM! BIDEN/ #WILMINGTON, DEL. MASSACHUSETTS/ ED MARKEY/ JOSEPH KENNEDY ARE PROBLEMS TOO! DELAWARE &amp; COONS! BEATTY’S IN #COLUMBUS, OHIO! GOT MY FAMILY LOCKED UP ON #MARIJUANA CHARGES! I’M NOT TO VOTE FOR THESE PEOPLE TO RUN THE WHITE HOUSE! #MaPoli
I dont understand. Kamala Harris scorched biden in the demoncratic primaries for obvious reasons she listed. And now she is running alongside him??? Is this political shit a game bros and sis?
Do you know what Donald..All your garbage your spewing out..voter supression usps mail in ballots..Americans aren't stupid..your BS only fires up voters to vote Biden and stand there and watch you crash and burn on November 3rd.. Your so low and desperate.sad
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews  👇 already being a true leader!
Isn’t the Secret Service protecting Biden and Harris right now should they be alerted of this threat?  look into
You ain’t Malcom Butler, Fuck Trump, Harris and Biden
And the hapless Joe Biden is claiming that the Obama admin is responsible for the Israel-UAE arrangement. Funny the only Mid East country Obama was interested in improving relationships with was Iran.
The difference between Trump and Biden is Trump loves the country and he cares about the future of the country. Biden thinks it’s a big fucking joke. Typical government worker.
Biden and Harris call for nationwide mandatory masks, an extremely American concept. “Mandatory”
I don’t know how anyone sees that Trump Ad as anything but Pro Biden  Electric Avenue SLAPS  And handcars are cool as hell
my wife posted an anti-Biden meme to facebook and it is taking an extraordinary act of willpower not to be extremely rude to the guy who accused her of spreading Russian propaganda

A fine tribute from Sarah Vowell to public universities and their graduates, which include both members of the Democratic ticket.
I’m going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but to say that criticizing her WHILE STILL SUPPORTING HER TICKET is “insanity” “nonsense” “ego” and “selfish”??? Say you have no empathy for people more marginalized than you and go,  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 3/3
It’s an insult that Biden and Harris think women will vote their way simply because a woman is running.  That’s pretty much saying you have no brain to vote for your own thoughts and opinions about intelligent topics.
Well unfortunately now, Biden incapable of simply answering questions. Maybe that man on the pic was, but that is not the man that is running for President.
via   Hooray. Incident free!
Yeah but before October there will be simulated footage of Biden eating a fetus and then looking directly at the camera and saying “yum yum, gimme some”
Private prisons are an injustice.  To imply that Biden/Harris will support and/or enable them more than Trump/Pence is just disingenuous tho
Well, we do have Biden on tape telling Amy he’s going to steal her husband and bring him to DC to help him. 🙄 The “problem” is the work Beto has been doing with PxP is going to bring seismic levels of change as to what TX politics will look like. They want him to keep that up.
Why are you attacking that ticket?  It’s a binary choice at this point: Biden or Trump.  To attack the Biden ticket is to support the Trump one
Tucker Carlson accuses Biden, Harris of embracing 'the Democratic Party's new pro-criminal agenda'

Kamala attacked Biden for his abuse against women. Also called him a racist. In 2016 headlines read “Kamala, first Indian-American senator.” She now takes a postion from that abusive racist pedophile(Biden, her own words)and headlines read “Biden picks BLACK woman as VP”👍🏻🐑#KAG
the field is wide open for a presidential candidate who believes in the coronavirus pandemic and the associated unemployment and housing crisis, joe biden could be propped up by his nurses and take it easily
But she dances so much better than Biden..............
Has The Biden campaign offered Timothy Ennis a cabinet position yet?
😂😂😂😂he be doing Biden dirty
Oh also he BLATANTLY dragged Biden at the end, absolutely glorious
Senator, you made us so proud today. God Bless you and may God keep you and VPOTUS Biden safe. So PROUD!
Apparently Biden and Harris want to seem moderate.
Are they really using a dead man's Twitter account to attack Biden and Harris.
If you yelled at Biden supporters because of Tara Reade but you still support Alex Morse, I have news for you: you don’t actually give a fuck about Tara Reade, or any survivors. Go ahead and tweet snakes at me. I *fucking dare you.*
Says the woman who called out an old white man for his racism and sexism directly to his face on national television and is now that same man’s VP choice. Fuck Biden, Harris, Trump, Pence, the US government, and fuck dumb cunts who are gonna think B/H is TOO LEFT.
plus we get lefties convincing themselves Biden is 100% indistinguishable from Trump so they don't feel responsible for letting Trump win and liberals retconning him into a progressive champion so they don't feel responsible for the ways he'll be trash  what fun
Fight to increase funding for our schools and to increase access to higher education to improve the political knowledge of our populace. These will all help to improve the make-up of our government.   So, please, vote. Vote for Biden and Harris.
I hear the fears that if Harris and Biden are elected, progressives (especially white progressives) will pat themselves on the back, go home, and think that all has returned to “normal.” That is real. But we must then work to continue to agitate for change.
Moreover, while Harris and Biden do not have ideal records what we should consider is what they currently stand on and what they’ll do in office. Their platform is the most progressive in history, regardless of their past actions.
I hear the arguments against Biden and Harris. People are not wrong for criticizing them. I’ve criticized them. There's a lot to object to. Joe Biden was literally one of the architects of mass incarceration and the New Jim Crow.
this has nothing to do with anything but sometimes I think about how joe biden’s son Beau died and then his other son Hunter started dating the widow of his brother ???
Donated to Biden. For you my friend.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris introduce their presidential ticket in Delaware
Wow a big crowd for Biden. Must be dozens of people there.
Big deal! With the things she has said about the POTUS why should we care? I happen to think she is as phony as the day is long. Her fake cackling laugh is enough to make  me want to throw something at my tv. I think she’s irritating and obnoxious just like Biden is.
In a surprising move, Biden picked the person that was the near unanimous front runner for the last six months.   Nailed it!
Given that Biden is slated to “hurt God,” I sure hope so.
Watching this Trump presser after Biden-Harris one
When Biden wins if they start to prosecute Trump he will flee to Russia and take His place and Vladimir Putin’s feet
When Biden wins if they start to prosecute Donald Trump he will flee to Russia and take his place at Vladimir Putin‘s feet
Who did you think Biden should have selected as his VP?
Brilliant speech by Biden. His best ever 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lol I can’t wait til Trump brings up Hunter Biden in the debates.
These debates are going to be fantastic. Biden can barely speak.
I see the right doing that non stop but he won’t resign. Like most old white men Biden is very stubborn
Biden looks cinched in this picture
Biden looks like the creepy uncle and Trump looks like this even creepier friend.
Thank God! I’ll be voting for Biden. #BidenHarris2020 #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
JOE BIDEN JUST GOT TRUMP REELECTED WITH KAMALA HARRIS PICK  via  so she got the job just because she a black woman that sad and embarrassing
WTH is your problem..you should be removed from your senate seat for colluding with Russia to taint Joe Biden..You have nothing on him..So please take your garbage and exit right..not gonna work. Your corrupt like Trump..
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
Not going to happen Bill. You and your socialist friends are going to have to deal with actual debates. Once Biden has to come out from behind his media screen he will be toast.
Man you are not a picture of health..Overwieght..Depleted..you look depressed and clueless and lost.. The writing is on your oval office wall..Your failed presidency won't end well. Your racist rants and anti-biden attacks won't serve you well..Be honest you knew this was coming.
Inwasnt talking about trunp at all but yea...thats what the government does. Put ppl in jail. Obama did it. Trump is doing it. Biden will do it. Its all the same.
Biden wants to decriminalize and expunge all the records for possession. But that’s besides the point because facts doesn’t seem to matter in this weird take. You don’t want to answer the question because your answers would be weird too. Enjoy your day.
People are hating on Biden for getting a cop VP but who else can better change the policing system than a former cop who knows how the system works? If she really wants to “fight for the people”, she’ll make the right moves to fix the injustice in the system
Harris is a yes man. A chameleon.  Lets not forget that she was a supporter of me2 accusations against Biden.  She a product of Bussing How does  Dems platform want to defund police hire the CA secretary of law enforcement. Harris is bad news ask willy brown. Its about tech $
I agree I don’t think Biden should debate Trump how can you debate someone who makes up facts and lies it will  be a complete waste of time
Yall think Biden and Harris are just gonna let yall protest in peace?
Better Than Hitler! Biden-Harris 2020. It may catch on.
Can I just point out: Biden, Trump, Kanye on the same ballot. Lmao
I'm a 71 yrs young white man who has seen so much in my life time. I'm proud of u both and pray for our country 💗🙏🙏🙏. Go Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  Our country needs u more than ever.✌️🙏🙏🙏💙💙💙 James I'll do my part for the good of all
I'm proud to be and will always be a Democrat. I think this ticket of Biden/Harris will be so strong that our country will finally come together, but there alot of work to do. Dr evil has left us with a huge mess. Hard work and we'll achieve all that is needed to be Great Again
Besides being intelligent, experienced, and attractive she possesses a strength and energy that would make a lesser running mate (Trump didn’t choose the passive Pence by accident!) uncomfortable sharing the spotlight. #BIDEN/HARRIS the perfect ticket for America!
Smh, and that’s Biden’s vp?
So y’all couldn’t make this thread after the election ? The whole point is to get Trump who is more evil and vile out office but when you do this thread you’re taking votes away from her and Biden
If you are unable to understand the needs of other people, you are incapable of being a leader. Biden is the right person at the right place at the right time!
Nice #racist combo. #KamalaHarris2020 family owned the plantations in #Jamaica and #Biden is stating to #Blacks #YouAintBlack if you leave the #Democrat plantation. Both putting the in jail as much as possible. #BidenHarris2020.
Wow! I guess it REALLY behooves Biden to back the policies that voters want, right? Why not encourage Biden to do so instead of jumping on the DNC threat wagon? Its on Biden to EARN votes not just be the less awful choice. Stop shilling, Bob.
Biden VP pick Harris promoted group that put up bail for alleged violent criminals
Me driving off 6 months ago the morning after the NH primary on little sleep.  I still have those high hopes for Biden/Harris.  The Democratic Avengers have begun assembling and it will be glorious.
Biden-Harris 2020 “it is what it is”
It's wild Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib scored such solid wins in well funded attempts to oust them happened in the same party that appointed Joe Biden as their leader and Kamala Harris as his running mate. Seems dysfunctional!
Did Joe Biden pick Ghislaine Maxwell for VP?
Maybe Rob Reiner looks like Joe Biden? Nah, Rob looks way better than Joe. Run, Rob, run!
She’s the antithesis of Warren, Markey, AOC, Biden/Harris White House, Omar, Pressley, Tlaib, Sanders. So 🤷🏻‍♂️ balance?
Joe Biden announcing Kamala as his VP like we ain’t seen this show already 🤣🤣
I feel like the most unbelievable thing about 2020 is the washington football team name change. like if you told me last year that there’d be a pandemic and mookie was going to LA and biden and harris were the ticket, I would have gone along with it. but this? no way in hell tbh
Guess you won't be crying when her and Biden start locking up more people for victimless crimes huh
Well,  didn't mince word in this  piece, "The Senate is affirmative action for white people"
Everytime you post a anti biden video..racist remarks about Kamala Harris.I will report your disgusting and pathetic tweets to  asap and to  . that would suck if you were permanetly banned from Twitter right to the election..Not kidding!Enuf!
🗣: In the end #45 has to go ! Get over it and vote Biden/ Harris or you’re apart of the problem! Periodt !
In juxtaposition, Biden is everything Trump is not.He's strong enough to pick someone who has challenged him; someone who is charismatic and accomplished. This bodes well for Biden's cabinet.
Hope you guys realize if Biden wins Kamala WILL be the president. She will run the entire operation.
Biden isn't winning, so it doesn't matter who Biden's handlers choose.
Taking bets on how long it will be before we go from President Biden to President Harris.
Joe biden’s slogan is “Build back better” which to me has under tones as MAGA and now he got that cop as his VP candidate ... shessssh
I guess it’s good to see that Biden actually did anything. We’re fucked no matter what happens. It’s all relative to your comfort level and how well one is fixed to survive a lot of horrible shit as we struggle and stumble forward.
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Federally legalize Marijuana tomorrow, and Trump/Pence win this election  Kamala already made all their arguments for them; re: Biden being an establishment dem, and a creepy one at that  And now they can slam Kamalas law enforcement history  The contrast between tickets is stark
Sen Kamala Harris as a running mate for Biden.
Trump on Biden's VP pick: Harris was my 'number one draft pick' - CNN Politics - lair lair lair I’m against #fracking too ! She doesn’t have any to take healthcare YOU DO!
He doesn't consider Biden a real Catholic because Biden isn't Pro-Life
"don't vote for Biden, allowing the president to be reelected, and maybe get a more progressive nominee in 2024" seems like a pretty long game to me
Trump is gonna get a bit offended by Biden's dogwhistles during the debate
Joe Biden and company did zero for women for 6 years. This woman minority not getting the attention. They have been humiliated by this country.
Biden almost selected Klobuchar but his staff wasn't gonna let him pick someone who'd immediately do him like LBJ did Kennedy. Day 1, stapler from a grassy knoll. Harris doesn't have the guts.
can't wait for vp pelosi when biden dies on january 21 when his organs start shutting down bc he forgot how to eat &lt;3
In 6 years Joe Biden did nothing. I personally don't want to live in his "mans" world anymore. Democrat: FOR WOMAN( ALL THE PEOPLE) Its more than workplace discrimination. Welfare is $500 a month. Imagine you lost your childs father in unexpected death! And get that
Please don’t put Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris on a pedestal. Yes they’re the better choice than Trump but they’re the lesser of TWO EVILS. Shits still not gonna be sweet.
We'll have our work cut out for us pushing Biden/Harris leftward, but not voting or voting for a third party candidate will do such harm to the country and (natural) world so as to be - in my mind - unconscionable. And I do believe the left's arguments have had an impact already.
After suffering 4 years with the Trump/Pence administration that has tried to drag America back into the worst years of its past, Joe Biden has selected a running mate enabling the Democrats to lead America into a proud future!
YouTube Biden Ukraine Quid Pro Quo Joe  Why? In 6 years he did nothing for anyone but Hunter Democrats used to fight for all the people. Currently woman and children have become last. Name 1 thing Biden and his boob Obama did for woman and children??
Sen Harris do you still believe VP Biden’s accusers? Do you still have an issue with him working with segregationalists? 🤔🤔🤔🤔

Kamala Harris – Biden’s VP Choice’s Story
if y’all keep complaining about the biden/harris ticket how are you going to expect people to vote for biden in november? even if y’all are still voting for him that’s not what everyone else sees. they just see reasons not to
I’m not a conspiracy theorist by any means but...what if Biden wins, resigns for health concerns, and Harris becomes not only the first woman, but the first black woman as President. President Harris has a nice ring to it 🤷🏼‍♂️
Listen: y’all can get your jokes off about Kamala as long as you still go vote for her and Biden because we can’t do 4 more years of orange. Thanks, Management
Honestly, I'm a little relieved it's over. I don't care about Harris. I don't care about Biden. But at least we don't have to listen to that brand of horse race shit for a while
Get over it.. You have lost every voter.. Biden and Harris will take over now..You already killed your base in those 163,000 americans.. Cyrus Vance is coming for you and Michael Flynn is going back to prison..Your golf clubs are calling ya
I will still be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket ...I just don’t think I have to shut-up and just vote!

Elect Biden. We need Maya Rudolph every weekend on SNL.
Did he wait to announce this when Biden announced his running mate. Was wondering what news would come out from him.
Hm, I actually think (being in a state Biden will lay zero attention to) that the best thing I can do is strategically withhold my vote. If Biden loses MA by a little less then expected, maybe he will be more inclined to take us seriously
I love this. It shows that both of you can come together, despite moments of tension, and being this country together. I  look forward to saying President Biden and Madame Vice President Harris.
Biden and Harris will pulverize your father in any debate..Start panicking jr..The end days of your fathers corrupt and criminal administration are coming..including Cyrus Vance from Manhattan..you and donnie jr and Ivanka..gone!  Watch! Your criminal enterprise is collapsing
Who put a miter on Biden's head?
Literally. Cause in another scenario I probably wouldn’t vote for Biden/Harris. But please don’t be dumb rn. I’m not worrying too much aabout a woman as much an a competent person taking office
Biden/Harris vs Trump/Pence lets see how it goes, tag match of the year? #tuesdayvibes #VicePresident #KamalaHarrisForVP
I guess the good thing abt this ticket is that it’s not radically progressive but just more of the same soooo the Republicans can’t really attack Biden on being left wing. The attacks fall short.
I must have texted LAST to 30330 by mistake because the Biden campaign still hasn't told me anything
*Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP*   Russian bots posing as Bernie bro’s:
Dude, you've got to disassociate with Biden/ Harris, no one is excited to vote for them. I can't think of a combo that gives less of a f*** about what is going on in America right now. There is no substance there. You're better than them! Forge your own path.
I donated to Biden instead!
If Joe Biden wins they are going to say he’s too mentally unstable so she will become president and Nancy Pelosi will be the Vice President
Too ambitious is just what we want.Ambitious to save America is why Im voting Biden/Harris
Semi-hot take on #KamalaHarrisForVP: If Biden wins, expect the GOP to get a lot more libertarian on drugs, criminal justice, etc.
Just like he was supposed to win over Biden? 🤔
Watch "Joe Biden Gaffes &amp; Bloopers" on YouTube
A VP pick isn’t just about helping the current candidate win. It’s about the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Biden ever securing the nomination if he hadn’t first been Obama’s VP. A VP Harris means we’ll be fighting the carceral wing of the Dems for decades to come.
Biden snubs African Americans picks Jamaican for running mate
Lmfao dawg I’m NOT prepared for 3 months of white people with red roses in their twitter name telling me I’m dumb for supporting a Biden/Harris ticket as a black man
giving us a little bit of hope for this year.    Time to go all in.    Biden/Harris 2020
Biden must have some idiots in circle to let him pick Harris. We’ve all literally been saying how bad she would be 🤦🏽‍♂️
I can say with complete confidence that Elizabeth is gonna be a good sport about this and all in for the Biden/Harris ticket. Follow her lead.
Lol Donald Trump has done more to get people out of prison than Biden/Harris ever did. A pox on both their houses.
Kamala Harris would not have been my first choice for VP. Biden needed someone more progressive to expand his base... HOWEVER an African American woman as a VP is MONUMENTAL
Hard work means more than family wealth. Vote Biden/Harris #RidinWithBiden #GoJoe2020
I’m listening to Stuart Stevens’ book “It Was All A Lie,” right now.  It’s healing to hear it after feeling like I’ve been watching and experiencing gaslighting for years.  But my question is, if Biden is elected, what will be the next actions of the people in the Lincoln Project
Kennedy/Johnson Johnson/Humphrey Humphrey/Muskie McGovern/Shriver Carter/Mondale Mondale/Ferraro Dukakis/Bentsen Clinton/Gore Gore/Lieberman Kerry/Edwards Obama/Biden Clinton/Kaine Biden/Harris

Kamala Harris was a former #1 contender for dem candidates I would consider drinking with. She fell out down in the polls when she dropped out.   Biden was never even in the running because I strongly dislike him - and I really like alcohol -  so that’s saying a lot.
The Democratic ticket announcement = Biden / Harris
I'm cautiously optimistic about the Biden/Harris ticket... but uh.. go team
Wrong choice. Shows lots about the pathetic state that Biden is in &amp; how the Dems are just wrong again.   The move was to the middle w/ the choice knowing cabinet would be left reaching and VP really the play caller.   Good luck winning over moderates on both sides w/ more crazy!

It’s official: Biden picks  as running mate.
Is #Biden attempting to lose to #Trump, it’s like neither want the job and are trying to out do each other for who’s worse for the job. #SENDHELP
Doubling down on my conspiracy theory that Harris got permission from the Biden campaign to do the one attack on Biden the entire primary.
Biden chooses Harris.
Now that the waiting is over, let's hit the ground running with turnout. Mail the ballots in and make sure to ask your neighbors if they voted yet? It's the very effective nothing method that made NOLA's 4th Ward 3rd precinct darn near 100% for every election. Biden/Harris 2020!
It's official:  Sen.  is Joe Biden's vice presidential pick.How did Biden’s presser go? Take a lot of questions?
You may be eligible for a mail-in ballot, but you have to say you’re voting for  Biden. They might even send you 4 or 5 ballots.

The Biden/Harris campaign is a total JOKE. Who runs for president and takes no questions?
The press is an integral component of the Biden/Harris campaign. If they’re told no questions, they don’t ask questions.
I tweeted all our concerns to Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell and Joe Biden.  I encourage you to do the same.  Complaining among ourselves isn’t going to bring change.  Bring it to the people with the power and PUSH.  Peace out.
Voting for Biden is about saving our country and democracy, Trumpler Is a fascist dictator and has already hinted that if he wins he will never leave office and have his kids take over when he dies. To may of our ancestors died to make America a democracy
I’m pretty sure the press is part of the Elect Biden team. When they do get to ask questions, you can be certain those questions will be pre-approved with the answers written on the TelePrompTer.
I can't thank  enough for his VP pick. Keeping my fingers crossed that she IS legally eligible to run, I've heard there are 2 areas that may disqualify her - haven't checked into it myself... Biden just handed Trump the election tied up w a nice little bow on top 😁😁
very true where is the joe Biden evidence?

Biden picking Kamala Harris is the best comedy movie since Tropic Thunder #BidenHarris
I wish Joe Biden was not the Democratic nominee but I am going to vote for him because he is the one of 2 options with any real chance to win
He recently said the 1917 (1918) pandemic ended WW2 in 1945 because the soldiers got sick, he also said the fatility rate is low for the US. And the right try’s to say Biden is in decline
I remember on election night in 1992 with Clinton finished Is victory speech, “don’t stop thinking about tomorrow” by Fleetwood Mac started playing. I think that would be a great song for election night this year after a Biden/Harris win
Are DemonRats swinging for the fences with the joke known as the Harris/Biden ticket really just hoping to win? My concern is they are more focused on down ballot elections trying to retain control of House and flip the Senate which would be disastrous #MAGA #KAG
Your dead wrong Obama Biden administration did absolutely nothing for Americans in 8 years And nothing for Blacks and their neighborhoods Trumps done more for Blacks in 3 years than Obama Did in 8 Look at the facts Prison Reform The First Step Act Better opportunity to buy homes

The Democratic Party picks Candidates based on party delegates and "super delegates" who wanted Joe Biden. The Democratic Party is wrong for America and they don't care about regular people just the elites it's time to end the two party system #VoteGold2020
Can we just accept that no matter who Biden picked they were gonna suck in some way, and some part of the "party" would be upset? Let's just face the music and head into november strong.
It keeps happening with Joe Biden also there's a video of him trying to nibble on his wife's finger. The DNC could have nominated anybody else but the elites in the DNC want racist Joe Biden
From the second I met Dave I knew that he truly cared about Easton residents and the residents of every single town in MA04. I would have loved to see him down in DC fighting for progressive policies during the Biden-Harris Administration...
So, the media treats Biden/Harris like the "Royals" and yesterday was their debut. Talk about "Low energy " entrance! And all they did was bash Trump! #Trump2020
I understand that Biden and Kamala have many many flaws but unless you like what Trump’s doing, keep that shit to yourself for now
If Biden and Harris get in  we will slowly become a third world country they will give U.S. away . Free Free who pays for it the taxpayer

Biden pushed Obama on gay marriage.
I don't care what Biden/Harris chemistry is. I just want to live in a sane world with a functioning goverment.
Biden is Catholic
Kamila Harris said she believes the women that accused Joe Biden of sexual misconduct and yet she’s his running mate? How can ANY Woman wrk side by side w/a man she claims to believe is a PREDATOR???
People are hating on Biden for getting a cop VP but who else can better change the policing system than a former cop who knows how the system works? If she really wants to “fight for the people”, she’ll make the right moves to fix the injustice in the system
In a better America, where Agent Orange had not been elected &amp; summoned a series of biblical plagues, I'd have said hell no to a wack Biden/Harris ticket. But, alas in order to save the remnants of a failing democracy, I'll hold my nose and mail in a ballot for #BidenHarris2020

Biden and Kamala really the biggest feds to ever fed
No only 1% will see their taxes go up under a Biden/Harris presidency and the the rich who will see their taxes go up. The middle class and poor taxes with go down. #taxthehelloutoftherich
Biden is a racist and always has been Look at his entire career he was against every Civil Rights Bill for Blacks and used racial slurs every time he opened his mouth and he’s done nothing for the American people even his 8 as VP You must know this but still say how great he is
Tucker Carlson...”Just hours ago, Joe Biden’s “handlers” announced “they” have selected Kamala Harris of California to run as Biden’s Vice President...”😂😂😂😂😂😂
There is no way we don't live in a simulation. All I saw on Twitter today was wet pussy debates. Biden picked Kamala Harris for VP. Former WWE wrestler Kamala just died and his finisher was the "Kamala Splash"  #BidenHarris #FOH
Yes Ma’am First Lady Biden🇺🇸
Biden just secured President Trump's second term.
Why do I feel like this move by Biden really hurt his chances of becoming president?
Just gasped so loudly when I saw Biden’s pick, that my coworker fell out of her seat #KamalaHarrisForVP #BidenHarris2020
A VP pick isn’t just about helping the current candidate win. It’s about the future of the party. It’s hard to imagine Biden ever securing the nomination if he hadn’t first been Obama’s VP. A VP Harris means we’ll be fighting the carceral wing of the Dems for decades to come.
NEXT VP NAMED Joe Biden named CA Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat Trump. #mapoli #VP
Not gonna lie, when I saw the breaking news headline of “Biden Picks Harris As VP Choice” I was incredibly disappointed to learn it wasn’t  sigh...
Biden just secured 4 more years of President Trump!!!
I'm so happy for you and our country. In these times its not often that there is a time for joy and excitement but this is one time. God bless you and VP Biden.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as running mate.
It's  Yes!
Kamala Harris was selected as Biden's running mate on the presidential ticket for the Democratic Party.
Dont worry  all these Karen's will be on video crying when he wins again. I wonder what their take is gonna be when the dems switch out Biden for a "medical issue"
Again. Accusations. Whether true or false. What does that have to do with the economy? Biden literally stole millions of dollars and sent it to ukraine. What's worse? I'll wait.
I legit can't think of anyone I want to as vp for Biden... But I'll take whoever.   But legit, this isn't the time to play around. His pick needs to bring in voters. If he chooses someone that undecided/on the fence voters don't like then it's a wrap. Please don't fuck this up
This. You vote for Biden and then you still get to make his life miserable for 4 years with constant activism.
I don't know why Biden would listen to him. He may seem moderate but he has extreme abortion views.
People that say voting for Trump vs voting for Biden is the same thing can honestly choke

A Trump campaign ad used doctored photos of Biden  via
He filed it and put it in the mail along with his ballot for Biden!
Biden is not writing these tweets if anyone thinks he has the mental capacity to write this you are naive..
When pressed by Errol Barnett of CBS News on whether he'd taken a cognitive test, Biden responded that the question was akin to asking the Black reporter if he would take a drug test to see if “you're taking cocaine or not? ... Are you a junkie?” Good lord.
Biden still manages to stumble 'despite hiding out in his basement'  via
Why didn't Biden and Obama do it. When they were in power 11 yrs ago.
The reason why We need a younger vp candidate is because Biden said he will only do one term, that mean in 24 the VP candidate will run. Warren is in her 70s so say she wins in 24 and only does one term then we have to find someone for 28.
Warren doesn’t add value to Biden because of her age and race. What ads vale is a younger black woman
Like I said I have no problem with a socialist president but a lot of people do. The independents especially who Biden needs to win
Biden wouldn't try to exploit Gettysburg cuz he's a narcissist.
I’m voting Biden no matter what but we don’t need Warren in the ticket or he has no chance. She is to old and will be labeled a socialist which will sink Biden. He needs a moderate black woman to have any chance to win
I do support whoever Biden picks but Warern isn’t a good chose if it means losing her seat. Especially with how Kennedy going after tithe other senate senate. That would leave no one good to run in a special election against the Republican incumbent
I understand but we don’t want her as VP she will hurt Biden and Cost the Dems the senate and RBG Supreme Court seat. First she is to old, second she will be labeled a socialist and Biden will be done
They're rebooting The Hunger Games where after Biden gets elected President and the whole country starves to death.
I hope Joe Biden learned a lesson about the times we are in. I get that he would listen to old trusted friends. The campaign should have stopped in its track the misogyny coming from some of his advisors.
Look at Biden’s career He’s been more  racist than Trump ever has Trumps done more for Blacks in 3 years than Obama in 8 Biden was against Blacks on every Civil Rights bill &amp; used racist remarks about every nationality since day one in office Yet Blacks still vote for this fool
America is in serious trouble if that idiot Biden and the Dems can rig the election Wake up lady

Which is a problem. He definitely is not in touch with who the party is now. He's the one who started the sexist Kamala attack. Which shows he doesn't respect the strongest voting bloc in the party are black women. This is what I worried about with Biden.
Joe Biden struggles to complete sentence about his mental fitness  via
I’m in Massachusetts so I’m not worried he had no chance in hell of wining my state but it’s the swing states, and even Georgia and Texas and Arizona where Biden is leaning and we have senate races that could be affected also
And as president after Biden bows outC she can higher Obama as an adviser to make sure the bodies stay buried.
Fuck trump let China help Biden! It’s not like trump wants every dictator or country to influence our elections since 2016
All BS Have you heard Biden? RACIST! I guarantee that Trump wins the black vote. He had the lowest unemployment rate in history for Blacks &amp; Latinos before the China virus. Even with Dems fighting him &amp; using the media for false propaganda -he has succeeded.
Over 10% unemployment still! Wow, that’s worse than the Great Recession.  Of course, President Obama and VP Biden would have never let it come to this.  Sad.
Joe Biden is a racist because he supported segregation and just this year he said that, "if you can't tell if you're for me or Trump then you ain't black", and voted the crime bill that locked up blacks
Can people stop asking if I'd wait in line for 8 hours to vote for Biden? We fucking get it.  Yes.  Who are you even asking and what's your actual G goddamned point?  That's rhetorical. I understand. But damn
Clyburne should have stayed out the Biden comment about latinex diversity. He didn't help.
Joe Biden is also a racist
Joe Biden says more racist things than Trump does but Trump is the racist
It's true. The media is either both siding stuff or falling for the latest Republican fake scandal. Like the dumb reporter who asked Biden has he taken a cognitive test.but we just don't hear or rarely see Joe Biden..?  Hmm.
That would be garish. Biden doesn’t need superficial stuff like that. He’s the real deal.  #TrumpPandemicFailure #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden has sent me roughly 300 emails in the past 12 years and not a single one can tell me where to get my Biden/Harris 2020 bumper sticker.

Yeah pretty much all police-related institutions will be pro Trump.  how do you think the elections going to pan out when every cop in the country is out stumping for Trump. But biden is leading in the polls...
No you're not , you had the opportunity and the votss in 2008 and you didn't pass it then.   even if you take the Senate and by some miracle Joe Biden beats Trump in the election you still won't get Medicare for all past because it's a bad idea and even Nancy pelosi knows it.
White mfers really be mad that people don't like Biden. Yeah it's easy for you guys to say you want the "safe moderate" option because you don't NEED drastic change. Because Biden didn't say you're not white if you dont vote for him and Kamala didn't mass incarcerate ur people.
Saving American democracy?? you people gotta relax, take deep breaths in the nose &amp; out the mouth, and realize Biden is NOT THE ENEMY.

He will be trespassing, after all.  He should be removed by force, if he refuses to leave willingly.  Once Biden is sworn in, trump has no more right to be there than I do.
As if anyone had to work to undermine Biden. This is some real Liberal Qanon stuff.
Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.
Because 2020 is the "take one knee" year, it makes perfect sense that "Dementia Joe" Biden would pick "Horizontal" Harris as his running mate. Harris will join Biden in his basement in Delaware tomorrow, to talk strategy, hair conditioner brands, and share some tapioca pudding.

I am concerned with Joe Biden’s safety based on Ms. Pirro’s comments. This doesn’t seem normal to me.
First thought was yeah President Biden has the stamina to operate a push cart. Trump's uncoordinated, fat ass would have a heart attack.  Second... does the train wreck trump administration really want the train reference? #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #DumpTrump
Honestly the only thing I’m looking forward to in potential presidential debates is Biden calling Trump a bunch of names that we’ll have to google to verify if they are or aren’t old timey slurs.

I smell sour grapes. Joe Biden and his team will do a fantastic job cleaning up Trump’s disastrous mess. 😎

If Russia can hurt Biden and Biden can hurt God, can paper cover both of them?Joe Biden wants to see that nipple.
I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Biden and Harris followed with him.
We will after Biden is elected and Democrats win the Senate.
How can anyone justify voting for Biden who has major elderly obvious problems.  Elder abuse poor man .  Should be age limits for politicians.  Disgusting
I don't know if the eye thing is due to dementia. Still, the choice between Biden with maybe-dementia and a raging malignant narcissist is easy.  I'm not diagnosing Trump either but he always talks and acts that way.
Thank you for pointing out so well how inept Joe Biden is.
Wasn't Joe Biden told he had to choose a woman of color in order to get support from the black community? I mean it's not like he vetted candidates of all races, and chose Kamala because he believed she is the best person for the job. This is pandering at its finest.
⁦ corrects yesterday’s Post piece:  the increasing acceptance of the Far Right has severely skewed where the center lies: Biden and Harris are far closer to the ideological center than the Left.  Kamala Harris exposes the GOP’s radicalism
So uh, I assume you're gonna ask Biden and Harris some tough questions too right?
Biden was in the Senate many years, made two presidential bids, and served honorably as VP.  Oddly enough, after so many years, the time is right for him as President and he’s right for the time we’re in. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
He is too stupid to understand that or maybe not stupid I just think he can’t remember Joe Biden for president is a mistake that this country would make if they elect him and his vice president is 10 times worse than where are at today
The wicked witch of the west on the Wizard of Oz! Gave me nightmares! 😂   Now it’s Biden, Kamala, Pelosi, and Schumer!
Ya right! Obama help Israel? Biden in his forgetful stupor forgets that:  1: Obama kept Prime Minister Netanyahu  waiting. Didn’t want to meet with him  2: Obama colluded in Israel election trying to get vote to go against Netanyahu. Obama did what he accused Russia of doing here
Vote for Biden!!!
Kamala: Ebola was not a pandemic! Obama &amp; Biden, during SARS ordered testing to stop! Why? Didn’t want high numbers released to us during election cycle! Sick of Democrats lying and treasonous activities! STOP LYING!
Well, he's white.  I don't recall any birtherism bs about HRC or Biden either.  You would think his blatant racism would be enough to vote him out, but apparently 50% or more of Americans are also racist.

How about you put this on your TelePrompTer! Get this through your lying brain. Biden has no brain left to get this through. He can’t even read it and get it right.
IMO, at that stage, he can be dragged off to the side in all of his insanity and stashed away in a locked room until Biden's term begins. Nobody will care and most will be relieved.
Like Trump said. She’s a nasty woman! Tell it like it is!  I’m sure Biden thought that after her attacks on him during the Primaries!
Has America not been lied too enough by the Democrats? Wake up people!  Compare Kamala statements about Biden before and now! LIAR!  She’s called a moderate? Are you kidding me? Not one Democrat should be elected. Is it possible 50% of Americans are stupid enough to believe them?
Kampala Harris has been a great pick as VIP with Biden. She really brings a lot to the campaign! People love her!   Yup! All 3% of those who voted for her during the Primary! 😂   By the way, she’s not African American. Get that straight!
One Thing to rule them all and in the darkness Biden

I don’t like Joe that much either, but you have two choices: Biden or Trump, and any vote NOT for Biden is a vote for Trump. You need to comprehend that. Refer to my earlier tweet about 2 party systems and FPTP voting.
Ok, let's do this!! First Black woman and Caribbean/Asian American on a major party ticket! No matter how you feel about her, just take some time to take in this historic moment. #WOC #represent
Lots of fodder for the Republican Party to work with!  Does she still think Biden is a racist?
Let’s Go.
Warren would have been a better choice but I’m gonna vote for Biden no matter what. Was hoping one nice thing could happen in a maelstrom of insanity, but alas, no. Just get this year done with already...
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
Like this pick - she was my top choice for President! Kamala Harris will join Joe Biden on the Democratic Party ticket as the VP nominee to defeat Donald Trump and Mike Pence in November -
Alright, BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!  #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpDepression #TrumpVirus #WeWantJoe

Ok.    Assuming you’re right, and it’s not just something he’s saying to placate centrists, what’s another viable option?    I want to know, because I’m not so much a Biden supporter as I am a “Get Donny Out” supporter.
And what chance do those policies have of becoming reality in a Trump administration?  Wouldn’t they have a better chance of happening under Biden?
How will our aims be achieved with a second Trump administration?     If we gain control of Congress to pass M4A (for example) could you honestly see it being vetoed by Biden?

You're unbelievably foolish comment about impeaching Joe Biden shows just how corrupt the current Republican party is. Also,  just stupid.  I mean you're intelligent yet you have to do this play acting as an anti-intellectual and to say stupid s*** to fit in.
I don’t understand.  How does attacking Biden help in removing Trump from office?    Isn’t that the immediate goal?
Yeah...  watch 11:15-12:24. Still voting for Biden no matter who he picks, but this is not my favorite take on police reform and allocation of funding.
None of the liberal media call out Biden for only making scripted remarks. Zero credibility
This is what Biden did do when faced with a pandemic: #WalkAway #Trump2020 #TrumpLandslideVictory
1. There is no way he wrote this "apology." 2. There is no way he remembers what he said even 5 minutes ago. 3. There is a pattern of Biden's gross, racist statements.

Biden is hiden because his mind is sliden  Please flood Facebook with this!!!
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like that
You are all racists  Joe Biden is goin to win in November ... 2nd place!

I had those very thoughts. How you think so do you write. No way Biden wrote the explanation.   So as he speaks, so will he write. Birripbirripbirrip, “that’s all folks.”  For those of you who weren’t around, look up Porky Pig! 😂

You're not getting it. Nobody voting for Biden is going to give a flying fuck what Trump does or does not claim about the election. We know the stakes. We will vote regardless.
So does that mean Biden is actually Raymond Shaw, but with dementia?  🤔

Do you really think he’s losing sleep over establishment Kamala?  The entire country rejected her just a couple months after she ran for president.  She called Biden a racist and says she believes his sexual accusers. You think she’s truly “team Biden?”  Easy win for Trump.

The Biden campaign has used this pandemic to attempt to cancel fair presidential debates. Biden has used the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to blame on Trump and portray himself as the only economic savior of this country. Think again about who is taking advantage..
Why no questions to our possible next president?   What are they hiding?   Biden has dementia and even if elected he won’t be running our country the deep state corrupt actors will be running us.    Soros will be the president.

what do u think joe biden’s opinion on cat girls is
Its nice to be rich, you would know, but poor because you gave time to your children  only to have your husband run off with another woman? Then there is the guy who never married you.SSDI is what ya get and its NOT ENOUGH FOR WOMAN. Biden never cared in 6 years!!
Inside the 3-month search for Biden's VP pick
In six years Biden did nothing for SSDI people earning low pay, ZERO raises in 6 yrs. WOMAN, once again are discriminated against! We are earning less, because we are home caring for children!!
I'm transgender. Fuck Biden. He wont do shit for me
Figuring a disability check is done by recent work, well that is discrimination to woman, we work great jobs for 30 yrs, take time for a family of 3, now an unexpected domestic violence tragedy leaves women earning the lowest rate, $10,000 per year? Biden did zero!

It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.

Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor

What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.
Biden campaign working day and night to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
They are doing this to hide Biden. Look at the fire over here, and not our candidate who is “funny” to say the least.
he just means that Biden isn't mentally sound which like, yeah maybe, but you think Trump is????
Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough
With all that is happening to the country, Wisconsin must be so proud that their senator is devoting all his effort to investigating what Hunter Biden did two years ago.
That’s the joke, dim wit, it wasn’t sarcasm. He loves TAys Sway... Hes just now admitting that he’s a Biden fan as well.
Trump campaign plans huge digital ad buy ahead of DNC, as Biden airs first ad with Harris
Sen. Biden previously suggested dividing Iraq in to 3 regions, now suggesting a Turk-Kurd peace process?  #Turkey #Iraq
You want us to believe that this happened six years ago but is just being publicized as Biden prepares to accept the Democratic nomination? Pathetic.
I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
I know.  She should make the list.  She'll be their biggest draw outside of Obama, Biden, and Harris.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
I imagine the argument is that there are people who want to defund the police who are still willing to vote for Biden and that's hypocritical (as if keeping Trump will help defund the police)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris looked pretty good in their matching navy blue masks on Wednesday.
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.
Can’t wait to walk in on Election Day to write in Kanye west while Libs get angry their mail in votes for Joe Biden (lmao) got lost in the mail.

Listen:  takes a look at the Democratic presidential ticket.   "This is going to be a very important election considering the changing demographics in our country. And it's going to really set the stage for future elections."
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!
Text TRUMP to 88022! I stand with
If they supported Biden all he'd ever talk about is boater fraud.
'If Trump wins, America will cease to exist': Biden team's best ad yet sets Twitter on fire  #VoteTrumpOut
Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.
In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. Jaime supports Joe .
I'm sure Obama will be pulling strings should Biden get elected.

Funny how political dynamics work and can change so quickly - Biden, a moderate candidate, won MA over liberals Sanders/Warren by surprise, and yet the liberal candidate in the Senate primary (Markey) appears likely to win over the moderate (Kennedy) just a few months later.
Biden was endorsed today my the Letter Carriers Union of the USPS.  I wonder which union has the most members and which carries the most weight?
How many are biden and cumswalla on?
Just to be clear, you all still better vote for Biden.
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn’t have ‘a Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter
Please rally all your followers to vote for Biden!
Couple of things. There is no Trump-living silent majority. There is a Trump-loving loud minority though. If everyone convinces one person to vote for Biden this will be an ass kicking of biblical proportions.

IMHO -- Biden/Harris INFINITELY better on ALL #cannabis issues than Trump, who will continue to appoint reactionary judges. Even if Biden &amp; Harris haven't been spectacular on issue, all the people around them will be much better than Trump's ideologues.
Biden should do ANY talk show or take ANY questions!!!!
Ummm nobody in America wants Biden either..
My neighborhood has no signs but it's a solid blue district. However we got a lot of unionists (it's Boston, y'all) that have visited the town rallying for Biden as well.
Biden's America.
The Ratchet Effect is even worse this time because Coronavirus gifted the primary to Biden. There's not been any of the dealmaking you typically see in the run up to the general because Biden has no NEED to compromise with anyone.
media ask Biden what he was talking about!
So, Biden will promise to move those kids to different cages and then not even do that?

Biden and Trump are the two dumbest sh!ts in the outhouse. 🥸
No he got voted in because we were sick of liars like Obama and Biden.   Speaking as a real trump voter and and ex-democrat.
Yep, Don't show Biden and the non-existing policies.  Just "but Trump"  You could run a cardboard box against Trump and win.  Biden's team will most certainly lose.
You're both right 🙂 A third party vote is a vote Biden failed to earn that only functions to help elect Trump.   If you have no preference between Biden and Trump then feel free.
biden needs to heed it now
If Warren were to join a Biden administration, Pressley would almost certainly run in the special election, right? That’s why this is Joe’s best shot.
This sounds like a ringing endorsement of Biden!!
I believe he would actually be second gentleman.  Jill Biden was the second lady, so a man would be the second gentlemen

It Looks As Though Biden's Friendship with Obama Is One-Sided
If you are still on the fence, just think about how voting for Biden will make some of the worst people on the planet very happy, while not voting for him would make them very angry. Pretty simple!
It will backfire. He will go off the rails. Then we watch Biden speak truth and act like a normal himan being later.
I'm in.
are you morons plugged in?.... trump?... LMFHAO... itll b Biden in a landslide and people will remember this shit

Although I do not believe Biden will quadruple our taxes, at this point I would gladly pay if it meant a national strategy to control this virus and get Trump out of office.
1 drink, and a line of toot every time John casack mentions he is the son of a mailman, Biden says he is the son of a coal miner, or warren says she is a coal miners daughter.

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.
Seems like you’ve give this a great deal of thought. I’m simply going to show up and vote#Biden/Harris
And like a typical right-winger, the point went right over your head. Let me help: ❌Biden didn't inherit an island ❌Biden didn't attach his name to businesses then run them into the ground ❌Biden didn't declare bankruptcy multiple times  ✅ Biden DID gain wealth honestly.
You don’t have to love, or even like Biden. Just VOTE for him
Biden's been talking about it since June:
How Indian Americans are reacting to Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's VP pick. From colleague
Seeking to amplify his law-and-order message, President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that "no one will be safe in Biden’s America" if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November.
Nope not at all.
Biden? This has nothing to do with Biden. This has to do with people from other states ignoring the fact that they don't vote in a Massachusetts Senate primary. Move on.

Well let's not forget we Greeks were there first Dukakis/Bentsen 1988. Didn't do so well. Hoping for a win from Biden/Harris.
In MA we had Hillary flags, stickers, Bernie stickers, Warren, Markey, Joe Kennedy, Pressley signs, etc.  Much more than Biden.  It’s noteworthy.  Seen tons of back the blue flags and Trump stickers this summer.
Can you imagine Biden trying to explain or justify his actions that are part of the Durham Probe??  LOL.  Garbled mess.

Also how do they expect those they diagnose as Russian bots to have the capacity to vote for Biden?
Alt-right is a hell of a drug.   Racists think Trump is racist, but he's actually not!   Meanwhile, not one communist on Earth thinks Biden is a communist, but he actually is!  Smooth galaxy brain.
I totally agree. Biden needs to show what a leader represents because we don’t have one.
and if we all actually did our research and realized the validity of third party maybe there’d be some fucking movement and progress within it. it doesn’t HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. seriously people, wake the fuck up. Biden is just a moderate, slightly less problematic Trump.
A website doesn’t sell policy effectively. Why doesn’t Biden himself ever outline his policy vision? Candidates like Warren, Sanders, Castro, &amp; Yang made detailed policy proposals in every public appearance. Biden refuses to describe how he’d govern so it’s hard to support him.
Since you are such a pig and a cheater, than you won't mind me saying fuck the Mail-in-Ballots because I am going to go and cast my Ballot for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in person wearing my mask this November 4th, and exercise my Constitutional Right to vote.
Joe Biden rocks!
Biden will regret this choice, even worse the tweet about the economic crisis with no mention of covid.
Biden may prove to be Obama’s biggest and worst legacy.
Prediction -- if Biden wins, Q will deliver the GOP's State of the Union response.
I will never give money to them again now if this is what they support then I’m sorry I can’t have anything more to do with them.
It won't work Leo. Biden is a stone cold racist.
Does Obama think  is creepy?
Look chicken little, you're merely hypothesizing that Trump is going to do a thing he's never done before; clearly that isn't a greater danger than the bloody wars &amp; US instigated coups/civil wars Biden has already engaged in &amp; is signaling a desire to regime change Venezuela
Yes my town in MA is full of Biden and BLM signs. Big course on the same lawn.
People screaming about how the Biden/Harris is flawed and therefore unworthy of your vote over 3rd party better check your fucking privilege before Trump gets elected and your country sinks even lower on the international stage than it has already.  Feel free to unfollow.

3/3 Calling for Democrats to 'go all out' and to avoid 'complacency' imply (1) a belief in the polls with all their shortfalls, and (2) a clinging to the belief that the Hidin' Biden strategy can continue to work as Trump brings the country back from this pandemic.
2/3 Cassidy concludes: "Trump and the viewers of 'Triggered' and 'The Right View' won’t concede of their own accord. Between now and November 3rd, Biden and his supporters will have to go all out to defeat them. Complacency isn’t an option."

No you're not , you had the opportunity and the votss in 2008 and you didn't pass it then.   even if you take the Senate and by some miracle Joe Biden beats Trump in the election you still won't get Medicare for all past because it's a bad idea and even Nancy pelosi knows it.
White mfers really be mad that people don't like Biden. Yeah it's easy for you guys to say you want the "safe moderate" option because you don't NEED drastic change. Because Biden didn't say you're not white if you dont vote for him and Kamala didn't mass incarcerate ur people.

the only reason black people still support Joe Biden it because organizations like NPR refused to tell them that the reason their father brother and Uncle were in jail because of laws Joe Biden crafted and then incubated to get passed.
Exactly why Dems no matter how bad they are have gotten the black vote since the 60’s. Joe “If you don’t vote for me you ain’t black” Biden was just saying what a lot of Dem politicians believe. Don’t criticize the flaws just vote for them and shut up

We lack a consistent national policy on treating COVID-19. I suggest the 50 US governors get together and create a consistent, uniform policy on treating this pandemic. Please support VP Biden's call for a national mask mandate implemented by governors as you've already done.

Hello its me, the radical left, we lost the nomination when Bernie dropped out and he was our compromise candidate, we think biden is a racist conservative asshole and most of us aren't voting because of it.   You can relax now. "nothing will fundamentally change"
but then, the DP  'suppressed' the vote by changing and discarding SANDERS' votes to name Biden as the nominee.
As opposed to voting for Biden in a safe state, which will inevitably be used to "prove" that it wasn't their fault they lost to Trump because look at how they got 3 million more votes
I think a Harris/Biden administration will likely double the impact.
Yep. It won’t be a good thing. It’ll hurt people but maaaaybe it’ll cause a huge influx of donations to the Biden campaign. But Trump’s base will love it. :(
Tax reductions seem unlikely given the enormous fiscal response to the Covid-19 business disruptions. Biden’s tax plan offers a glimpse of what we may be facing in 2021 and beyond.

“#Harris [is] aligning...with Biden’s proposal to add a public insurance option to compete alongside private plans. Still, she memorably raised her hand during one Democratic primary debate when...asked whether they could...scrap private health insurance.”
if you think that Trump's use of the Patriot Act and of the structures created by the Crime Bill make him a fascist, then you already agree with me that Biden is a fascist, you're just not willing to connect the dots

I’m getting real tired of genuine Biden supporters. I and many others are gonna vote for him, but nobody has to like it.
If Biden loses, the moderate few will not supplant the extremist many; the rhetoric of the DLC will not trump the policies of the DNC. If Trump loses, the RNC will cut its losses; Republicans will then campaign as “conservatives,” and govern like Romney, Ryan, and Rubio.
She should be in the hot seat, not Biden.

What The Biden-Harris Ticket Means For The 2020 Campaign
“[Biden] has pledged to appoint a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Now he has picked another, a senator who defined her political career around campaigns for justice, as his running mate.”
LRT if I vote for Biden Harris it's because my hand has been forced not because I would ever want either of them in a position of power
Kamala doesn’t have to worry about Biden groping her given his racists past
Debates: Biden vs. trump Kamala vs. pence  Can NOT wait to see you both squirm!! #BidenHarris2020
Um hi, far left communist here. on behalf of the actual far left we hate her and consider both her and Biden to be reactionary far right conservatives and they would be in any other western democracy.
He will be trespassing, after all.  He should be removed by force, if he refuses to leave willingly.  Once Biden is sworn in, trump has no more right to be there than I do.
As if anyone had to work to undermine Biden. This is some real Liberal Qanon stuff.
Totally. But yes, exactly about the shortlist. This is Biden, who no one (I know) has high expectations of. Why would our expectations of who his VP pick be so high? I was just relieved it wasn’t Whitmer, who likely would have lost him MI because she has turned her back on Flint.
i’m curious how many people are going to not vote now because biden picked kamala harris as his VP?
The trump Biden debates are gunna be legendary funny though, only good thing out of all this
Were progressives complaining about Harris looking at Biden’s shortlist? Pretty sure they wouldn’t have been happy with anyone (except maybe Warren), so I really don’t get the up-in-arms indignation.
Wear it like a badge from moron King Con Don and The Greed New Deal #nastywoman #kingCONdon #fake #fraud Fake eCONomy        #biden #kamala
😂😂😂😂 The Biden/Harris team is going to bury you.  All your weak and childish verbal assaults will mean nothing.  They care about people.  You care about you.
She’ll dump on Biden after his first few mistakes and she can show how incompetent he is. Then she is a shoe-in for the remainder of the term
Radical left? I know you’d love to play that card but that’s impossible with a Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket. These two are the most centrist candidates of the bunch. Painting them as radical left will just make you look sillier.
Joe Biden is a racist that helped elect our first black president and announced a black woman as his VP? Stop projecting and get over yourself. Cherry picking quotes that sound racist just to prove your point, sad! He also gave all Americans, including Black people healthcare.
You old sack of potatoes, the suburban housewife??? what the hell??? We are strong, fierce, smart warriors and we want you OUT!!! You are the worst person on the planet!!!!! VOTE BIDEN/HARRIS 2020💙🙏
Be well and heal quickly so you can dance in the street when Biden/Harris win in November
I don't now.  just said Kamala Harris is a far-left Democrat ... That Biden is signaling his administration would be going in that direction as well, vs. Clinton, who signaled centrist direction by choosing Al Gore.
I challenge you to name a Democrat other than Tulsi Gabbard of whom you would not have said their selection moved the Biden campaign further left.
like they wouldn't have let Nina win either but she wouldn't have left Joe Biden standing
I was wrong to set aside my misgivings about Bernie Sanders  My initial read of his failure to apologize for SESTA-FOSTA was the right one and I succumbed to a version of the peer pressure that's leading some with lefty inclinations to vote for Biden
Biden Harris, one is a  bigoted old man and one is willing to sleep with the  bigoted old man to get ahead. For America!
But hey, tell me more about why I should love the ACÁ. And stop making this about Trump. My beef is with the Dems and Biden and Harris. If you don’t want that argument then move the fuck along.
I love that all of you end your discussions with this. No actual rebuttal, but a wish for people to suffer. Says a lot. You’ll be happy to know, I guess, that I’ll die of kidney failure and leave my family in debt while we wait for incremental change from Biden and Harris. 👍🏼
who cares? given all the horrific fucking things Biden believes and will actually do, I'd take a kooky new age wine mom with legit leftwing politics.
Dropping out mid race and endorsing the least progressive democratic candidate is definitely not something she as an actual progressive wanted to do and did so for the DNC. It's not exactly a secret that the DNC wants establishment democrats like Clinton or Biden to win.
Tom: I'm voting for Biden Twitter: You need to get onboard! Tom: I am. I'm voting for Biden Twitter: Don't you know what's at stake? Tom: Yes, that's why I'm voting for Biden Twitter: DAMNIT! YOU JUST WON'T LISTEN TO REASON!
I'm not blaming Warren I think if he chose her he would actually have a chance i just think its hilarious that she was the only other real option besides biden or Bernie and biden fucked her even after all she did for his campaign.
Trump will win 2020 because Biden chose Harris
Harris as VP choice is a massive slap in the face to anyone who hoped for Medicare for All, anyone supporting trans rights, judicial and policing reform, and anyone who hoped that Biden would make any overtures to progressives. Fuck!
That’s very bad news for Biden!  If Trump is only 3pts behind Biden in Minnesota at this junction of the race, he’s poised to win the state of Minnesota in November ... which means Trump will defeat Biden handily for the Presidency.
Biden has already accepted the invitation to all three debates. Trump has not.   This is fake news.
YES. I also think Kamala is a step in the right direction in putting more liberal politicians in places of power which is why I’m a bit more optimistic. She’s not ideal but she’s more left than Biden and Trump obviously.
If youre getting fired up to vote for Biden rn you still have a soft spot on your head
kamala harris was not my first, second, or third choice but would she be a hell of a lot better in a position of power than trump? YES. and that in itself is reason enough to vote for her and biden. (note that she votes on par with bernie in the senate)
for those of you who need to hear this:  TAKING THE MORAL HIGHROAD AND NOT VOTING FOR BIDEN/HARRIS DOES NOTHING BUT PREVENT PROGRESS + ENABLE FURTHER DESTRUCTION TO THE COMMUNITIES YOU CLAIM TO VALUE  swallow your pride and recongnize your privilege.
i’m not 100% on her but she does have a liberal track record in the senate and she’s smart so i’m hoping she’ll help keep senile joe in line. also it would be symbolic to have a woman vp. but it‘s really bad timing on Biden’s part to pick a VP involved in criminal justice...
Yes. Biden-Harris
Trump. Biden. Or the iceberg.   I'll take the iceberg for 1200 Alex.
nah im planning on voting for biden. in the grand scheme of things id rather him than trump and like there is no goof answer or course of action in a broken system
I mean, I’m holding my nose and voting for Joe Biden of all people. That I don’t like his vp isn’t gonna stop this leftist from voting out the fascist. (We can work on educating the capitalists in the meantime &amp; afterwards :) )
Biden helped create yhe criminall justice disaster we have today and harris supported it during the 2010's.    When will people stop just accepting people like these.  Racism will be swept under the rug. Democrats just want it out of the view so they can say its all fine.
Can’t believe Biden chose Quibi as his running mate
Counting the hours until to VP debate!!! Sooo excited for Biden/Harris!!!
One last thing, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote for an actual functioning White House cabinet, a couple potential Supreme Court seats, and the chance for a blue Congress that will actually get shit done.
I would kill for a Bernie Sanders &amp; Stacey Abrams Democratic ticket. But Biden and Harris is a start in the right direction in history.
Don't waste your breath.  Looks like Biden/Harris is a done deal with more enthusiasm than the first moon landing.  The Republican party is beyond repair, it's dead.  Face it, people are fed up with the criminal enterprise that's destroying our country.
KAMALA IS AWESOME.. PERFECT PARTNER FOR JOE BIDEN!!Joe Biden, I don’t know Dan Quayle, but you were no Dan Quayle!!
sigh. i wish this country knew that there’s a better choice on the ballot than biden or trump but we so focused on this two party system. and NO its not Kanye💀

You literally, in a nutshell, said that Joe Biden did what his accusers of sexual misconduct said he did. Now..you’re going to jump on his wagon? You are the worst martyr in modern time. Women look for successful women for motivation, and this is what you do. You’re a sad person
So..  do you no longer believe nor care about the sexual misconduct victims of Mr. Biden? Now, choosing to look the other way or just being the crooked politician that Democrats welcome with open arms? What a joke. Women must be proud. Disgraceful

Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate is resonating with Black women.
With Biden's pick of Kamala Harris as his VP, Mike Pence must be nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs
That there should put fear in our hearts! You realize that she will be President within a year after they remove Joe Biden for dementia! Thank God he won’t’ win!
Using same analogy,you also said you believed Mrs Reid . So that would make VP Biden not qualified to run the highest office in the country right?  We expect equal treatment right?
Biden and Kamala can make this a better country but they can't stop some people from being idiots
Trump's Attempted Attacks On Kamala Harris Are All Over The Place. Because he’s an asshole.
I'm pumped for Biden /Harris! Who's with me?
Check out this link to a USA Today story in photos of California Sen. Kamala Harris' career. Joe Biden chose Harris Tuesday to be his pick to run for vice president on the Democratic Party ticket for president.
Coons as soon as they seen Biden picked Kamala Harris as if that does anything for our people 😂😴😴
congratulations. I am so proud of you. I will supporting you against Donald trump and Mike Pence who better watch out you got this Kamala I have your Back Biden/Harris 2020
If Tulsi was the VP pick...I would be 100% with Biden. Such a shame. After watching Tulsi on J.Rogan I really thought she would rocket to top of the party. Instead, they said she was a Russian puppet 😂I don't agree with all her opinions, but she seemed level headed &amp; intelligent
Donald J Tramp just shit his depends when he found out that Biden named Kamala Harris as VP choice
You will have an important role to play within the Biden-Harris administration I’m sure. You are too smart, talented and valuable to leave out. Well done, you as always.
She destroyed biden in the last debate, she hates his old ass. Wonder why she said yes?
Say what you want,  is one of the most reliably progressive members of congress, and she's bringing the Biden ticket with her. I am happy about this news.

Right now the media I believe is just as scared as many Americans of what this country will be like if Trump wins again. Biden isn't the long-term answer. But he's a big improvement over Trump in my opinion. You can argue that if you'd like. But I'll stand by my word.

This is so whack! Smh. Media can attack the president on the daily. Barfin up falls BS. Then on the flip side this sh** happens?
For example they started planning on setting Hillary to be the nominee right after Obama was re-elected. Had no idea how involved it is in pre-determining who should run and win.
Fox Host makes ominous prediction about Joe Biden then immediately tries to walk it back
I thought is was to be the pres against the challenging pres....when did the rules of engagement get changed? Biden is unfit to even think of running...dems are dishonest to the core.

Joe Biden had eight years under Obama to build back better. What did he do,  nothing. They said that it would take a magic wand to bring back job's and the economy. Well it takes a person who understands how business works and that was Trump. Who do you trust .

The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.

Chairman Biden and emperor's Harris will be right at home with the CCP.They've already started using some of the policies of Chairman Mao Zedong. Next thing they'll have the gov. to start distribution of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedongs little Red Book . We're in for it
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.
the FBI  attorney that falsified documents to spy on Trump is making a deal with the Fed's in order to get a lesser sentence.  A "chain" is only as strong as its weakest link. If I was Obama-Biden I would start looking for a good attorney because you'll need one.
Yes voter disenfranchisement is a problem. However the reason people don't vote is because they think both parties are the "same" which is a lie meant to suppress young people from voting. If a young person can't tell the difference between Biden and Trump then the lie worked.

Biden said the travel ban was xenophobic and he wouldn’t have closed the borders. Democrats advocated large crowds for Chinese New Year, they still advocate for large crowds and rioting? How would you have prevented it? Locking it up for marijuana possession?
We can’t have it both ways. We can’t say Biden can’t remember his own name AND plagiarized something from 30 years ago. He isn’t writing his speeches or they’d read “C’mon man! This is um um um how the hell did I get p-p-pudding in my knig-nig-knickers?! K-K-K-Kamala man!”

Oh how quickly people forget, in 2008 this Country was a total mess and Obama and Biden came into a mess. They fixed General Motors, Wall Street, housing mortgage problems. They got us out of a disaster that once again the Republicans got us into. Kamala did much for CA
That’s a big fat lie and you know it. Never did She ever accused Biden of such things!
I can’t wait to see you campaigning. I see the Smiling side of you and it’s Sweet, now I want to see The Stern side as we elect the Biden Harris Presidency. (Put your seat belt on)
If Bernie and Warren are at fault for anything, it was not having a plan pre-primary for how to still unify when things inevitably get tough and heated, or when one of them has a heart attack while the other just passed Biden in the polls in the same week.
Thing I’ve been telling myself to deal with the fact there was every logical reason to pick Warren: A Biden to Warren admin would never be the Warren presidency she or we wanted bc she wouldn’t have the mandate of being elected on her own platform. She’s free to be herself.
, no matter how she got to the top, some say that she had affairs with her boss. That's up for debate. But the fact that she's here is a threat to the way of life as we know it if Joe Biden gets elected. Higher taxes, open borders, and everything else. #KAG

People wonder about this country’s shortcomings. Then I see videos of people crying about Kamala Harris being chosen as Biden’s VP. They obviously don’t know about her record as a senator, much less anything before that. So being a female is more important than her achievements.
The GOP is pushing for Kanye west to be registered in a swing state to siphon off votes from the Biden campgain causing trump to have a win and a potential Biden state
Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
"Biden and Harris remember Beau Biden in their first remarks together as running mates"
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.

I would actually enthusiastically vote for Biden then 🤷🏿‍♂️😅
A whole speech and not one mention of bleach, I don’t think Biden can pull this off
I’ll admit Trump’s treatment of women is deplorable and disgusting and there’s no room for it anywhere in this world. Can you say the same about Biden? Will you condemn him for it?
You missed the point. I’m not defending Trump, I’m implying you’re a hypocrite. Biden may not have as many accusations, but he has them too. My money says you’ll have no problem voting for Biden though, which makes you a hypocrite.
Wow, Biden is boring and Trump is destroying Biden in followers.  Good to know. Biden is second in another category.
Let's skip the debate with presidential candidates because you're worried people might figure out Biden is deranged.  I'm not a Trump fan and I can tell you don't want a debat because Trump would eviscerated Biden.  Just come out of your echo chamber and admit you lost already.

Uncle Joe Biden for President 2020
For how stupid the Biden campaign is, I actually totally believe it. Though if Biden has stronger convictions he wouldn’t let a gaffe get in the way of course of going for substantive change.
So we lost having an eventual president that believes in single payer, a wealth tax, student debt cancellation and an overhaul of Washington corruption and Wall St because Biden made another stupid gaffe. Big structural wtf.

Dude w the Biden shirt wants new blood and a king... confused much?
Steve We have some serious problems with this ticket. Its not bad enough that Joe Biden said that he's going to be the most progressive candidate, but its becoming a reality with his VP pick. We've got a fight on our hands this coming election. #KAG #Trump2020
Biden will get a nice little bump from the Harris pick as well. 👍🏻
Biden / Harris. Eh.  At this point I'd take Monkey D. Luffy / Tony Tony Chopper over the current team in leadership.  #Election2020
When your entire campaign is hinged on portraying Joe fucking Biden as a radical leftist you in trouble.
Oh buddy, you really wanna go down this road?? Biden campaign is gonna light you up haha
Jim Polito Daily Poll: How will Kamala Harris impact the Biden campaign?
Trump clearly has dementia. He can't complete a sentence. Biden does not have dementia and has served in the senate and as VP with no problems. You are delusional if you think tRump and his adolescent tactics are going to work this time around. He's losing his base.
Innocent thought? There’s nothing innocent about hiding the DNC elected leader has full blown dementia. If they cared about the country they’d pick a different candidate. Biden the politician is dead and Trump’s the coroner who will call his TOD. Just like he did with US politics
Biden stands a decent chance of winning now that he's kissed the ring on the k-hive. Which is great for me because now he DEFINITELY doesn't need my vote! I can write in Yang or cast it for Howie Hawkins without losing any sleep. Honestly this shit was over for me months ago.
It wasn’t because she was being courteous or whatever to Warren, that was some bs. Biden had it in the can and she was just playing the field as she does.
If Biden didn’t have the courage to stand up to Wall St and make her VP he won’t have it to make her secretary of treasury.

What’s sad is a “person of faith” reducing everything to one issue. Guess you wouldn’t have a problem with Biden or Harris if they were accused of pedophilia.
Not to insert myself into the national conversation. But you have to wonder if Joe Biden would have chosen differently if Elizabeth Warren had bothered to be on the Bax &amp; O’Brien Show. I say no. But maybe I’m just being too modest.
He got my ass but he isn’t a sexual predator like Biden is right?
is dead-on, as always: “Watch SE Cupp's reaction to Biden's VP pick”
One word: Benghazi. It’s irrational, but I think it would have ultimately hurt us. I really do like her though, and I’m sure there’s a place for her elsewhere in the Biden Administration!
Wow. Nice pick Joe.
I'd be tweeting more about Harris, but for the #mapoli Chernobyl we're living through, except to say politically Biden won't lose votes with Harris, which is frankly the only consideration. Nobody would gain him more. Harris will be fine.
Harris, now the American people will hear why the both of you haven't condemned the violence that's plagues all the major cities. Not one democratic leader has spoken up against the violence.  WE'LL SEE AND HEAR YOU ABOUT THE VIOLENCE
Biden and DNC tried to make Kamaal step aside for Susan Rice, but Kamala would not back down. Points to Kamala for standing her ground.

Biden can’t handle anything and likely whoever is VP will take over as president at some point. If Biden has any strength it’s already foreign policy so I don’t see what Rice brings to the ticket. What sells right now is the economy, healthcare, climate change, student debt, etc
She thinks Hillary is going to be charged with a crime next month. Must be rough, being a day drunk, Pam! But don’t worry, we’re all voting soon, and a President Biden will be a good and decent president. Unlike the POS there now.
Baffling that Biden and son are being criminally investigated in Ukraine as we speak, and yet not a sole in the media talks about it. They are still trying to tell us that the Russian hoax is still real as if it were not already deemed false.

This nasty woman says BIDEN/HARRIS 2020.
I don't know if the eye thing is due to dementia. Still, the choice between Biden with maybe-dementia and a raging malignant narcissist is easy.  I'm not diagnosing Trump either but he always talks and acts that way.
Kamal called Biden a racist and believed his accusers... look further into him also
If undecided, Pelosi will be interim president... their plan all along... it was never Biden/Harris, that was a smokescreen..
Alright Jonathan. What about taxes? Biden has shown his, should Trump also show his? Biden has laid out what he’d do with the next four years, should Trump do that as well? Biden doesn’t owe the media anything, although if we’re comparing the two, let’s be fair.
Biden was in the Senate many years, made two presidential bids, and served honorably as VP.  Oddly enough, after so many years, the time is right for him as President and he’s right for the time we’re in. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020

I think the body language and rhetorical roles in those debates was telling &amp; likely by design.  Biden was on the periphery bringing the others back on topic when things we’re getting testy.
There goes Biden’s chance in hell of winning 👍
Congrats on your naivety that Biden and the Billionaires he’s indebted to are going to bring substantive change to that
You cant make this stuff up, it wooldnt be believed...
If Biden is the candidate that most aligns with your values, then it was a wise primary vote for you. Personally, I value healthcare, social justice, corporate accountability, etc...
Not true. Now do Biden..
Don’t blame you.  I’d wait until Biden is sworn in to open.
Joe Biden is the bus that Kamala Harris will use to run over our country
I get it. No one is happy with me about it (wife included). I promised myself early on that Id vote for any candidate other than Biden or Bloomberg. I refuse to accept that we have to be basic b’s in America with a 2 party system. The dem platform just doesn’t speak to me anymore
Her words and behavior? Thats the qualifications? Ok..Now do Biden...
History is filled with great leaders making alliances with former rivals.  Woodrow Wilson picking William Jennings Bryan for Secretary of State.  JFK and Lyndon Johnson.  Eisenhower and Earl Warren.  Despots kill rivals.  Great leaders form alliances.  Biden - Harris.
Biden’s call for mandatory face mask for 3 months is a joke and shows how deperate he is for a headline while he continues to pander to any and all in search of votes no matter what the repercussions. Really sad. He doesn’t have an original thought.
what a phoney Kamala Harris is. She is a poor choice for VP that Joe Biden was forced by the left of the party to nominate. It will cost him any chance for election as America will see right through her. She’s an attack dog only. Period
Is it okay if my take on Biden picking Kamala Harris is that I don’t give a shit?
I had tears listening to both Biden and Harris .. they weee so refreshing
Only ones creating problems are the dems and rinos, I don't see Republicans rioting,looting in the name of a criminal,stop your BS,biden hasn't done crap in his entire political career
When Biden announces his VP pick.
As long as the mainstream media parrots it back (you know they won’t challenge him) both Biden and Harris will continue to lie or just make stuff up.
How about you and you’re Ilk apologize to Joe and Jill Biden for the scurrilous and unfounded claims leveled at him by you and  on behalf of Tara Reade and we’ll call it even Krystal? A cold day in hell? That’s what I thought.
Ok so as someone who thought Biden was going to do 1 term, it would seem to me that the Harris pick suggests I was wrong. If he’s gonna do 1 term, he would have a VP running for the Dem nomination for his entire term. He doesn’t want that. Just a thought.
Huh, the news media shows Biden, but not Trump. #Biasnews?

Biden can read and won’t eliminate intelligence briefings. He would’ve had an immediate, appropriate response to C-19. Anyone who is ok with putting their health, safety &amp; security in the hands of this incompetent Putz is just as mentally ill as he is. You’re sad.
Yes.  Historically bad.  Take a look at record, her own view of Joe Biden during the primary run...
Isn't Biden Catholic???
Don't worry, when Henry isn't posting racist stuff about Kamala, he's posting about Hunter Biden conspiracies in Ukraine.  Seems like a real straight shooter.
Does Kamala Harris as VP increase the chances 2016 Trump voters vote for Biden?
Yea, just like Hillary right? Why are you guys so naive. Biden isn't winning shit Its obvious they control the narrative Trump is winning by a landslide. So many people were democrats and after this whole blm antifa shit they've come out and stated they will vote for Trump.

I like the Biden VP pick
I genuinely think that this pick strengthens the ticket. It take a very niche kind of person to get pushed from Biden to Trump at this point.
Biden succumbs to left and goes Kamala. Good luck with that. Biden-Harris is a losing ticket. She’s nothing but an attack dog because Joe can’t. No one want’s a potential of Harris Presidency.
Kamala- not good enough to be the Dems’ frontrunner. But plenty good enough to takeover when Biden is inevitably relieved of duties due to the blatant mental inadequacies? I struggle to understand why the Dems’ don’t just pick a presidential candidate to collectivey rally behind.
It's  Good pick. I took these during her presidential campaign swing through Portsmouth, NH in February, 2019.  #election2020
Joe Biden is taking so long to announce his VP because it’s taking this long for his staffers to explain to him that he is not the VP, he is running for President
What if Biden is announcing a large portion of his cabinet with the VP announcement?! That would be great!
Why Trump is unlikely to pull off an election surprise against Biden like he did with Clinton
It’s going to be a woman of color. You can guarantee that. Biden’s camp doesn’t want to be fielding questions for the next 3 months on why, out of all the qualified WOC, he decided to go with the status quo. It would be suicide.
Biden’s main consideration, all along, has been for his VP to be someone who he trusts, is ‘Simpatico’ with, and someone who could slip into the job, if needed, on day 1. Foreign policy is a main consideration for the former Foreign Relations Comittee chairman, just a thought.
I was just thinking today about when  started to enter the conversation of those being considered for VP. Early on, she was not even mentioned and then all of the sudden her name began to drop in talks. I think this was strategic on the part of the Biden campaign.

I plan on renewing and upping my weekly contribution to the Biden campaign through Election Day, and start donating to the DSCC through this campaign season. If we take back the White House, but not the Senate, all our hard work will have been in vain.

I think Biden brought her to Delaware and is building up her name in order to help her in Michigan and for future endeavors. The actual choice has probably already been made, and kept very much under wraps. It’ll be a WOC, and deservedly so.
Joe biden said "She can have any role she wants".... then he's gon do this to her?
This is true. But remember how Trump got the nomination, with 35% of the Republican vote. If the moderates can coalesce around a ‘Biden’ like the D’a did around Bernie’s leftism, they can beat back another Trumpist.

My 2 republican uncles and aunt who are tired of Trump told me last week that they would vote for Biden if he picked harris. Would write in someone else if he picked rice. They think rice is hillary part 2 and  that she lied about benghazi...Shes too hawkish. ..
Remember Marine Corps (pronounced Corpse by Obama?  Not to mention countless gaffes by his Vice President.  We know why Biden does it though and it’s just sad.  Maybe Queen Botox prays for him nightly because she’s such a good Catholic.
Idk ab y’all but I don’t think just voting for Biden to “just get trump out” is smart. We shouldn’t be voting like thatNewsweek apologizes for op-ed questioning Harris eligibility -- Newsweek has apologized for an op-ed that questioned Sen.

Do you really think he’s losing sleep over establishment Kamala?  The entire country rejected her just a couple months after she ran for president.  She called Biden a racist and says she believes his sexual accusers. You think she’s truly “team Biden?”  Easy win for Trump.
For shits and giggles, cause I don’t think we’re changing your mind...what if Biden wins decidedly...what would that mean to you?

The Biden campaign has used this pandemic to attempt to cancel fair presidential debates. Biden has used the economic downturn caused by coronavirus to blame on Trump and portray himself as the only economic savior of this country. Think again about who is taking advantage..
Why no questions to our possible next president?   What are they hiding?   Biden has dementia and even if elected he won’t be running our country the deep state corrupt actors will be running us.    Soros will be the president.

what do u think joe biden’s opinion on cat girls is
Its nice to be rich, you would know, but poor because you gave time to your children  only to have your husband run off with another woman? Then there is the guy who never married you.SSDI is what ya get and its NOT ENOUGH FOR WOMAN. Biden never cared in 6 years!!
Inside the 3-month search for Biden's VP pick
In six years Biden did nothing for SSDI people earning low pay, ZERO raises in 6 yrs. WOMAN, once again are discriminated against! We are earning less, because we are home caring for children!!
I'm transgender. Fuck Biden. He wont do shit for me
Figuring a disability check is done by recent work, well that is discrimination to woman, we work great jobs for 30 yrs, take time for a family of 3, now an unexpected domestic violence tragedy leaves women earning the lowest rate, $10,000 per year? Biden did zero!

Newsweek has apologized for an op-ed that questioned Sen. Kamala Harris’ U.S. citizenship and her eligibility to be Joe Biden’s running mate, a false and racist conspiracy theory which President Donald Trump has not dismissed.
Biden / Harris will get us through CoronaVirus 💓🌎☮️
How many days to go?
Biden did nothing for people like me disabled from domestic violence earning less than $10,000 per year, because I am a woman who took time off from a career, single mom I add. Trump cares. Biden has no heart for America just for Hunter!! Who made disability about recent work?

Joe Biden chose PHONY KAMALA HARRIS AS VP - YouTube
I heard Pence was governor before. This guy has no mind of his own. He worships trump. Like trump said, “if I tell him to drop his pants he will”. This is their relationship.
Should he not have used drone strikes to kill terrorist? Lets not forget he took out 22 of the top 25 leaders in a Al-Qaeda. What should he have done differently? He also voted against the Iraq war so lets not forget that. As for Biden that bum has never seen a war he didn't love
Weekend at Bernie’s —I mean Biden’s
Harris, who was tapped by Joe Biden to serve as his running mate on the Democratic ticket, was born in Oakland, California, and is eligible for both the vice presidency and presidency under the constitutional requirements.
Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
how is it my fault biden would veto m4a?
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

There is no way we could here in MA- they would really damage our home. But they can put Biden signs up? The hypocrisy is astounding
What are your views on the Letters Carrier Union endorsing Biden/Harris? While I appreciate the truth you speak about things negative, your endorsement of positive things would probably be beneficial to the cause. Your voice carries weight. A positive to counteract the negative?
Lmao says someone that supported Hillary  probably lol says the person that voted / voting for Dems #biden that is losing it is a racist .. and the Obama administration lied and tried to take down a man running for president and then a elected president lmao ok
How many people are putting BIDEN on their boat and cruising around? Better yet, how many people who are proud Americans are flying Biden banners and American flags?   Just curious for comparison.
Strangely enough,most of the people who decimated Biden on some of these issues just excuse Markey. Biden is the nominee....we still have a choice in the Senate primary race.
Biden campaign working day and night to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
They are doing this to hide Biden. Look at the fire over here, and not our candidate who is “funny” to say the least.
he just means that Biden isn't mentally sound which like, yeah maybe, but you think Trump is????
Well he uses both, because there’s a pandemic you buttplug.  Is this the official slogan of the Biden campaign?  Took long enough
With all that is happening to the country, Wisconsin must be so proud that their senator is devoting all his effort to investigating what Hunter Biden did two years ago.
That’s the joke, dim wit, it wasn’t sarcasm. He loves TAys Sway... Hes just now admitting that he’s a Biden fan as well.
Trump campaign plans huge digital ad buy ahead of DNC, as Biden airs first ad with Harris
Sen. Biden previously suggested dividing Iraq in to 3 regions, now suggesting a Turk-Kurd peace process?  #Turkey #Iraq
You want us to believe that this happened six years ago but is just being publicized as Biden prepares to accept the Democratic nomination? Pathetic.
I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
I know.  She should make the list.  She'll be their biggest draw outside of Obama, Biden, and Harris.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office
I imagine the argument is that there are people who want to defund the police who are still willing to vote for Biden and that's hypocritical (as if keeping Trump will help defund the police)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris looked pretty good in their matching navy blue masks on Wednesday.
Vomit stains from when he found out Kamala Harris was Biden’s vp choice.
Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.
Do you have reading comprehension issues?  Nowhere did I say anything about Biden being fascist.  No wonder you're a liberal, you probably couldn't grasp any theory.

Listen:  takes a look at the Democratic presidential ticket.   "This is going to be a very important election considering the changing demographics in our country. And it's going to really set the stage for future elections."
Biden chooses a running mate who is staunchly anti Catholic, totally unqualified &amp; most likely ineligible because she was an anchor baby. These Democrats are a joke and trying to steal an election thru this plandemic hoax. Both baby killers and puppets to the Communist Chinese!

Biden is a complete and utter coward. Has news conferences without answering any questions. Hides in his basement to occasionally give his sayings and skewed facts. Now wants to avoid debating the sitting president. Who would vote for this pussy and his baby killing VP choice.
In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. Jaime supports Joe .
I'm sure Obama will be pulling strings should Biden get elected.

Couple of things. There is no Trump-living silent majority. There is a Trump-loving loud minority though. If everyone convinces one person to vote for Biden this will be an ass kicking of biblical proportions.

Biden should do ANY talk show or take ANY questions!!!!

My neighborhood has no signs but it's a solid blue district. However we got a lot of unionists (it's Boston, y'all) that have visited the town rallying for Biden as well.
Biden's America.
The Ratchet Effect is even worse this time because Coronavirus gifted the primary to Biden. There's not been any of the dealmaking you typically see in the run up to the general because Biden has no NEED to compromise with anyone.

No he got voted in because we were sick of liars like Obama and Biden.   Speaking as a real trump voter and and ex-democrat.
Yep, Don't show Biden and the non-existing policies.  Just "but Trump"  You could run a cardboard box against Trump and win.  Biden's team will most certainly lose.
You're both right 🙂 A third party vote is a vote Biden failed to earn that only functions to help elect Trump.   If you have no preference between Biden and Trump then feel free.
biden needs to heed it now
If Warren were to join a Biden administration, Pressley would almost certainly run in the special election, right? That’s why this is Joe’s best shot.
This sounds like a ringing endorsement of Biden!!

Not really. They're panicking that the people they love will die, that our country and our environment will deteriorate, and that Black people will suffer even more than they have. They are sucking it up and voting Biden because the alternative is 4 more years of Trump.
Obama was a ringleader in forming the Democratic Borg around Biden to oust Bernie Sanders as frontrunner, and his phony-baloney Hope and Change halo has been the centerpiece in Biden’s post-VP electoral efforts. So, guilty as sin.
Seems like you’ve give this a great deal of thought. I’m simply going to show up and vote#Biden/Harris
And like a typical right-winger, the point went right over your head. Let me help: ❌Biden didn't inherit an island ❌Biden didn't attach his name to businesses then run them into the ground ❌Biden didn't declare bankruptcy multiple times  ✅ Biden DID gain wealth honestly.

Alt-right is a hell of a drug.   Racists think Trump is racist, but he's actually not!   Meanwhile, not one communist on Earth thinks Biden is a communist, but he actually is!  Smooth galaxy brain.
I totally agree. Biden needs to show what a leader represents because we don’t have one.
and if we all actually did our research and realized the validity of third party maybe there’d be some fucking movement and progress within it. it doesn’t HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. seriously people, wake the fuck up. Biden is just a moderate, slightly less problematic Trump.
A website doesn’t sell policy effectively. Why doesn’t Biden himself ever outline his policy vision? Candidates like Warren, Sanders, Castro, &amp; Yang made detailed policy proposals in every public appearance. Biden refuses to describe how he’d govern so it’s hard to support him.
Since you are such a pig and a cheater, than you won't mind me saying fuck the Mail-in-Ballots because I am going to go and cast my Ballot for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in person wearing my mask this November 4th, and exercise my Constitutional Right to vote.

therefore cannot be equated with “helping trump” despite all the propaganda surrounding it.   liberals want anything anti biden to be pro-trump, so that way you aren’t allowed to be anti-biden (or anti-democrat) which is v fascist imo.   now you know, please don’t play into this.
such as my state, massachusetts, where biden will win by 30% of the vote.  most states are like this.  only a handful are “swing states” where there’s a chance the state flips.  because my state is decided, not supporting biden has zero effect on the election outcome and -
in the usa, presidential election is decided by counting up electoral votes, which are assigned by states’ winners.  so whoever wins my state, (biden) gets all 12 electoral votes.  then whoever hits 270 first wins.   at least 40 out of 50 states are very much decided...

Happy to see the Biden campaign actively disputing misinformation right out the gate. Harris’ own campaign should have demolished that Lara Baezlon article day one.
The timeline of Trump and Guiliani's coordinated effort to bribe or extort Ukraine into manufacturing dirt about Hunter Biden is far odder and more damning, but you couldn't be bothered to take an interest in that during an impeachment trial.

These people aren't "Biden" voters. It's a good meme, decent propaganda...but they're anarchists. Some of the larger crowd will vote for him, but the ones scheming this stuff aren't any more likely to vote for him than Trump.

White guy spouting white privilege.    Check Your privilege and get to the end of the line.  Ps. Biden is a confirmed predator.
With Biden in charge it will be the real deal a bloody affair that "reasserts the global leadership of the USA" or some other Public Relations, bullshit  Trump said he wouldn't recognize an electoral loss prior to "winning" in  2016 so repeating the same thing is no surprise
had the nerve to say President Trump “coddles” terrorists.   What planet is this lunatic on?  You mean like give Iran $150M in cash plus much more.  😂 Just another LIE from Biden
Trump tried to regime change Venezuela, it was the kind of half assed effort that has put him at logger heads with John Bolton &amp; the Neocons, the same Neocons who now back Biden so it's not a wash &amp; you are downplaying the imperialism that Biden represents &amp; why Neocons back him

Biden is going to win. Everyone is aware that Donald trump will in fact receive millions of votes. Right? So why would I be nervous of some friggen boats. It proves bupkis..... next
It’s just you  , guarantee you would not have said this if they had endorsed Biden’
There's this fucking all or nothing attitude on our side. Yes, Biden in bullshit. Yes, Kamala is TWAW, but for fucks sake, neither of them is a Nazi taking money from the Russians with fantasies of being a petty dictator.   Jesus fucking Christ. There is no equivalence there.
Which lies? Seems to be anecdotal to me. Obama, clinesmith, comey, biden, pelosi are also on record with their lies. Now I just insert a meme here and we've gotten nowhere and Trump is still the president of the United States.
Not a good thing.  USPS workers shouldn't be endorsing Biden, either
Yeah because you are a Democratic puppet . They play people like you every 4 years.  In 1977 Biden said integrating black students would turn schools into jungles. His 1994 crime bill incarcerated thousands of black men. Kamala Harris incarcerated black men as a prosecutor
She literally just turns herself into a different person every time she speaks. She tells you what you wanna hear. What a joke.Millions of people in the country and they choose Joe Biden and Harris LOL wow
Yup, this is why I’m not gonna bother voting for Biden, fuck centrists
I want him to win.  2020!   will let China take more of our jobs. You think it's bad not if Biden wins it will be the apocalypse.
I think Biden respects the rule of law and  the normal political process that usually keeps us alive. I don't need Biden to love or even like me. I need him to respect the Constitution and not be a Nazi with dictatorial pretensions.

I agree - expect that fewer will die under a Biden regime. Nevertheless, he has told some, to their faces, that he doesn't care and that they should vote for Trump (or whatever primary challenger). People who have those existential issues will probably not turn out for him.
No. There are so few such people that they aren't even worth mentioning. It's all in your head.  However, there *are* a lot of people who have told Joe Biden about their existential issues, and he's told them to go vote for somebody else.
Omg. It’s that blousey woman that said Biden accosted her!!!
my brother admitted that Biden is "an empty suit" and my dad claimed Biden is racist and I agree with both of them  my dad said Trump isn't racist because he's created tons of jobs for Black people
my dad thinks masks are just virtue signaling and that no proof exists that they are effective and therefore municipalities should not enforce mask wearing with fines  also he's voting for Trump because Biden "died 3 months ago"
This isn't about me. This is, as I said, about people who will die under either regime. Biden *could* reach out to such people. But he's decided not to; tells them to vote for Trump. (they won't vote for Trump) That's his call. But recognize that it suppresses the vote.
So the election activities for Democrat Communists includes marching to a Police Union leader's home and then proceeding to terrorize his family and neighbors with the wrath of the Woke Mob. The new normal in America if Joe Biden gets in office

Yea, conspired.  No one thought Biden was going to win until the popular ex president convinced everyone else in the party to drop out of the race and endorse him, despite Obama himself not being sure Biden can win.

The evidence of a very big conflict of interest in Joe Biden having Giuliani fired when Giuliani is looking in to corruption his son is working for and getting paid $50 thousand a month. As if that isn't the definition of quid pro quo.
Did Joe Biden say on national TV when he was VP that if Ukraine doesn't fire the Giuliani he was going to withhold a billion $ in aid? Yes he did. Was Giuliani looking in to corruption in Burisma? Yes he was. Was Hunter on the Board of Burisma? Yes he was.
Last night on PBS Newshour, Fauci told Judy Woodruff that we need a "uniform and universal" commitment to mask-wearing. The Biden/Harris strategy reflects this call.
FYI Joe Biden does things to help his son's investments like telling Ukraine to fire the lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that was looking in to Burisma and their dirty dealing. Hunter was on the board of Burisma. Talk about quid pro quo.

(True, but 65 points is a pretty broad black coalition. In the South, anyway - and Biden has a chance there this year.)  Hires like Karine Jean-Pierre are gonna go a long way to helping the young black vote, &amp; Biden is working on his Latino outreach.
Nah. Clyburn gave Biden SC, and it swiftly became clear that black voters weren't interested in Bernie, like, even a little bit. I mean, he lost Mississippi the next week by 65 points. Obama has a lot of weight and he surely helped clear the field, but come on.
You know, Joe wasn't even in my top dozen choices, but we have an actual fascist in charge. You know what they say about fascists? The second term is when they feel emboldened to do whatever they want.  I'm not voting for Biden out of loyalty. I'm voting to save the Republic.
Kamala Harris never called a biden a racist. In fact she specifically remarked at a presidential debate “I do not believe you are a racist” after she addressed his opposition to busing in the 70s.
Harris said she believed 3 women (not Reade) who claim Biden inappropriately touched or kissed them. It does not fall under the legal definition of sexual misconduct, however I do believe it’s inappropriate. Trump thinks it’s ok to grab women by “the pussy”.
Here is actual data of the effect the Crime Law has on incarcerations. The drastic increase was due to state laws, not Biden’s law.
4. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Law which imposes harsher penalties for domestic violence and rape offenders., the 10yr Assault Weapon Law, and the “Safety-Valve” the relieved some inmates from the mandatory 3 strikes provision.
1. The Crime Bill is a federal statute &amp; cannot be enforced at state level. Only a few states actually adopted harsher penalties. 95% of inmates are in state prisons, not federal. 2. Biden opposed the 3 three strike mandatory life sentence in 94 &amp; now.
I mean, if Trump and Biden BOTH want to bow out, I'm cool with that.

Baffling that Biden and son are being criminally investigated in Ukraine as we speak, and yet not a sole in the media talks about it. They are still trying to tell us that the Russian hoax is still real as if it were not already deemed false.

Yeah I was using presidential primary results thinking that Biden voters would be more likely to vote for Kennedy but obviously there is flaw in that reasoning
Watch UNDENIABLE PROOF Of Biden's Mental Decline  via
there are a couple big "ifs" in what i'm about to say so mind that, but if you assume most bernie/warren voters=morse and biden voters=neal (kinda makes sense?) then the pres. primary results in MA-01 kinda align with these results...?
Joe Biden better not go to Mexico.
While I agree with the sentiment, I have to ask: are we talking about Joe "I wrote the Patriot Act after the Oklahoma City Bombing" Biden doing this?
SO WE DONT GIVE THEM JOE BIDEN
I’m sorry but I just laugh when I see this. The left attacks Trump 24/7 saying he’s racist. It’s pathetic how in the hell do you explain even this tiny little portion of Joe Biden’s Blatant racism and why the hell isnt this on the mainstream media
Desperate CNN Runs DEFENSE For Biden As His Campaign Starts SINKING!  via  😂 😂 😂

CNN's Brian Stelter OUTRAGED That Right Media Rags On Biden In Total Lac...  via  Brian stelter literally has the least self awareness of anyone.... ever!
How could you say don't waste your time? There's still a significant amount of time for Biden to continue digging his grave. Trump is a great president and more people are recognizing it! I switched parties this year. Best decision!
Biden couldn't debate with a turtle. He is ill and his wife should put a stop to this elder abuse
Next time the right wingers start claiming that Biden has slowed down, just remind them that #TrumpCantRideABike
This is a Joe Biden voter.

So let me get this straight, Russia is again using active measures to interfere in our election by working to denigrate the character of Joe Biden. And they are using two US senators  and  as their bagmen… Can you say #RussianAssets
If Biden wins, it is more than likely because a conspiracy of states doing what they can to steal the election.  Polls be dammed; I don't see ANY energy whatsoever with the Biden Campaign.

Biden clarifies comments on diversity in African American community  via  idk how he does itfull video and analysis coming out short. #trump2020 completely destroys biden but thats funny because they not at all what the media reports on.
Why Chris? You don’t answe any questions. Why should Biden do weekly “press conferences.?” Job qualifications for president doesn’t include “how does he handle a barrage of questions?” All the voters need to know is where he stands on the issues and what his plans are. Period.
PETER LUCAS: If Biden is elected, be prepared to live in the new dystopian United States
Harris bringing energy, dollars and more to Biden’s campaign
Oh sure - heck, I voted for her for Senate and was happy to do so. I still supported Bernie because I thought her M4A plan was weak, but still.  But no cabinet secretary wields more power than POTUS, and Biden is actively hostile to my interests. So... it's a rough choice.
And, again... I'm in MA. I have *massive privilege* in this situation; if I was in Michigan or something I would have to take a very different tack.  But if I want to see a world where some of the things I care about, like M4A, actually *happen*... I dunno if a Biden vote does it
Except I sorta feel like accepting that formulation is a good way to ensure that you'll *never* get something to vote FOR  Like, Biden is less bad than Trump, 100%. An ounce of crap is better than a pound of crap, too, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna line up to eat the ounce
I can understand that position, and I respect it wholeheartedly. And honestly, if I wasn't living in MA - a state that if Biden loses, he's got bigger problems than just me - I might feel the same.  My issue is... holding my nose is what I've had to do for multiple elections now.
Dear everyone trying to vote-shame me because my lack of enthusiasm for Biden somehow equates to supporting Trump in your minds:  Please stop. It's not going to work.
538 did an analysis last month arguing exactly this.
Private prison industry backs Trump, prepares if Biden wins
EDITORIAL: Biden’s VP pick puts U.S. on cusp of history
You’re deluded. Biden is inherently smarter than Trump.  Worlds more educated on the key issues. Sane. Has much sharper mental faculties. Do you even watch Trump’s incoherent and paranoid ramblings? #returntonormal2020
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris pushed past their one-time political rivalry to deliver an aggressive attack on the character and performance of President Donald Trump in their historic first appearance as running mates.
Is your arthritis acting up. .or are you just complaint because .stop riding Biden ..your acting like an XWife.  Biden and Harris is the future of USA. For all not just the .0.1%
is P.Harris and Biden fans of FOX and friends .?
is joe Biden Kennedy going to win over Ed Market for MA.?
If you go to  it goes to Joe
The people voting for Biden, are the same people who bought lonza ball's $495 shoe that explodes 😂
And run against  ?  yeah great idea. Just shine a spotlight on the racist comments he has made against minorities living in low income housing. Brilliant strategy. Trump is toast. Admit it .
Not a fan of Biden policy at all. One’s Catholic faith is a personal walk with Jesus Christ. We are all sinners. The goal is to learn &amp; grow. I believe that there is no pro choice. It is pro murder. Christians who support this stance have to address in their time with Jesus.
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
In naming Kamala Harris as his running mate, Joe Biden made a groundbreaking decision, picking a woman of color to be vice president and, possibly, a successor in the White House someday.
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play...
Why does your Daddy care if Pamalla Harris was mean to Biden .Your Daddy hates Biden .
Biden, Harris.  Smell my Willy 2020
Are you happy with Joe Biden’s choice of running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris?
Pass. I’ll be making my BIDEN/HARRIS 2020 signs!!
Guess she passed the Biden smell test! Smelled a little like willie......🤔🤔🤔
If trump wins in November, then it will be proven that enough people lie to pollsters to ruin their usefulness forever. If Biden wins, we can chalk up 2016 as an anomaly.
He is also gathering ammunition, graciously supplied by Trump. He will unload it all when the leaves begin to turn .... Trump, meanwhile , is firing all his bullets now. By October he will have nothing new to say about Biden.
Let’s be clear  —  is a Rhodes scholar compared to dim witted Donald trump. He is also smarter and has sharper mental faculties than both you and trump. He will shred dumb Donald on the debate stage and would take you apart as a bonus .
Biden has reason to get into a back and forth “he said , he said” with trump every day. And daily “gotcha” grillings from the media don’t educate the voters about policy and principles. Frankly it’s refreshing not to have a campaign of sound bites.
I guarantee that after the first debate , whenever it is , trump will find an excuSe to try and cancel the others. Biden will mop the floor with him. Clinton tried to trade quips. Biden will undress him and show trump for the ignorant buffoon he is.
More data the media will never show you. Way more accurate than the fake national polls - remember 2016  Who raised more money from small donors? #trump vs #biden  Full analysis
