People pointing out that Biden's lead at this point in the race is similar to Clinton's lead need to remember that at this point in 2016, Clinton was at the peak of her convention bump.
538 has the Biden margin at 7.6. Still down two points from early July, but RCP is just more prone to fluctuations.

Barry will pick Rice (for Biden) soon. If Michelle really is out....

Whoever Biden picks, I trust his judgement and will vote for him! #stopbickeringoverit
The most important thing to look for in a VP is someone ready to become the next president after Biden.
You described Biden perfectlyüëå
This is why I have said journalists and pundits need to shut up about who Biden will pick. You all have made it worse! You should be saying instead "we support Biden's pick whomever he decides on".
Whoa whoa whoa....Biden is considering a running mate who is ruling out a run for POTUS? Are you kidding?
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.

Former Vice President Joe Biden now says he supports travel bans to contain the Chinese coronavirus after all ‚Äì after he previously called the China travel ban issued by President Donald Trump in late January ‚Äúxenophobia.‚Äù  THIS MAN WILL SAY ANYTHING AND LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING
So true. The most perfect examples are in office right now and they have to be voted out! Biden Pelosi Schumer Nadler are stealing directly from us, all of us. And lining their pockets with our hard earned money. How can some not see that!!
So.. my only (and I mean only) concern is that Biden would be a one term president and then she‚Äôd be one and that could have some effects on the future of the party. OTOH, she‚Äôd probably make some good trouble in the meantime.
I mean, Lewis absolutely loved the Clintons. Nobody is perfect. But he was pretty fucking close.   Also, yeah, Biden being kinda beliefless is why I want Warren as VP. She‚Äôd be the soul of the admin. That doesn‚Äôt appear likely at the time though.
We really don‚Äôt deserve John Lewis.   Post presidency Obama has annoyed the hell out of me but he effectively boxed Biden in on some pretty major stuff today so I have to STFU now.   Bill‚Äôs legacy becomes more and more fitting as time goes on.
I don‚Äôt watch much TV. Only stream what I like. But if I ever see another Biden ad I‚Äôm gonna puke. Shouldn‚Äôt pedo Joe be in prison, along with Hunter and the rest of the family? Why is he amongst us? Put him away!!  Embezzling money laundering old bastard is acting like he‚Äôs king

Where was Joe? Getting a haircut or something? Hidin‚Äô Biden!
One theory: he's kinda like Biden in that he moves to the center of the Democratic Party, which means moving left in the Trump era.
You know what's funny?  Biden said he'd try this back in April. CALLED IT.
Biden will nationalize zoning rules and eliminate local controls. How do people in local towns and villages feel about that?

We all know Russia wants trump to win. So why not have the gang of 8 just agree that anything that comes out about Joe Biden is Russian propaganda and false? Easy fix!Why is Russia so scared of Biden?

I used to like your analysis and podcast because it was fair to Joe Biden. But I‚Äôm truly unimpressed by this silly article.
Karen Bass was mostly unknown outside of California when her name popped up as a potential running mate to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
So you're okay with someone filing under a party called The Birthday Party, but being helped by the Republicans, admittedly as a pawn, using him in his manic state to attempt to draw votes away from Biden?  But if the Dems did it, you would cry foul?
is a bigger person than every Trump put together. Among many attributes he is honest and virtuous. When he makes a mistake (like all of us) he owns it, apologizes and does better. Biden will bring our country back together again.

I heard Joe Biden said something racist, this is news to me! I can't wait to vote for....ohhhh
Joe Biden says he doesn‚Äôt give a shytt about Latinos Whyt3s Asians Indians Middle Easterners etc. His commitment is strictly to African Mericans. This is comforting
Funny stuff... But watching Biden actually and factually have a hard time arguing with his own deteriorating brain is even funnier. Can't wait for the debates, if Mr. Biden makes it.
His campaign is playing it right. Any vp is going to be attacked, and their attacks on Biden don‚Äôt seem effective, so they aren‚Äôt going to open the door for other attacks until they have to. Smart play, he‚Äôll pick a good one (they‚Äôre all good anyway).
Trump takes 2020 pitch to Ohio as Biden gains ground from afar - POLITICO
I've been advised that the idea that Biden would try to avoid all debate is a right wing fever swamp idea.
He‚Äôs an Idiot! Biden and Obama did nothing in 8 years ü§¢ of course Biden is going to select a black person, qualified or not, just for the vote!! I hope black American families see through what he‚Äôs doing !! Blacks are not stupid! He‚Äôs playing games r
Biden says Harris is 'very much in contention' to be his running mate  via
Did y‚Äôall hear what he said. Biden is racist and his policies since he‚Äôs been a public official will tell you that exactly. Crime bill of 1994, the comments he continues to make but the media lets him slide with it. Cmon now. Don‚Äôt be a sheep
It actually was a non-sarcastic question. Your answer was much more helpful than  thank you. I have no opinion either way, but Scott‚Äôs tweet didn‚Äôt seem to defend the chief so much as insult both Mayor Barrett and for some reason Joe Biden...
To vote for Biden? üòÇ
Can‚Äôt really be a hypocrite when I wasn‚Äôt comparing anyone to Biden, simply pointed out an observation. He‚Äôll loose a debate to the wind. You brought Trump in as most people who are butt hurt about Biden do. They are both shit candidates. Chalk up 2020 as an L
I‚Äôm not exactly sure what this has to do with anything? Joe Biden is a joke. And everyone knows it üòÇüòÇ
I don‚Äôt know who is more clueless Trump or Biden I feel sad for both of them.
Omg Joe Biden how did you get my email. Stop emailing me.
Winning by a small margin isn't enough (Trump's tricks and dirty maneuvers), Biden needs at least around 320 to 330 EVs, to avoid Trump trying dirty maneuvers. Also, the senate is equally as important as winning back the White House. It's time to end Trumpism, forever!
Damn that's some racist shit by Biden
Can you honestly tell me that‚Äôs the best candidate the dems can come up with?? Just because I think biden has dementia doesn‚Äôt make me pro Trump. Don‚Äôt get butt hurt at the facts and then throw Trump at me in response
Statement from DNC spokesperson after 3 positive COVID-19 test results at convention site in Milwaukee. Organizers stress this didn‚Äôt prompt yesterday‚Äôs decision to keep Biden and other speakers away from MKE
Yea that was pretty bad too but I‚Äôm at a loss for what comes out of Biden‚Äôs mouth
Exactly. This is the one thing that shows Biden is the bigger and better person than trump.
"If you have a hard time deciding whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black!" - Joe Biden  Reasonable people don't believe yiu
yeah, if biden was the guy trump says he is i would be thrilled to vote for him!
Is it safe to say Biden is even more entertaining than Trump? It‚Äôs so damn close and I love it.
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
Hi President Biden don't that sound good. My name is Carolyn and I'm a Democrat. We need you to come to Wisconsin so that we know you won't forget about us like Hilary Clinton did or you will lose Wisconsin.
lmao JOE BIDEN THE MAN WHO WILL KILL GOD
So you're completely ignoring the fact that I'm literally responding to people saying that Biden won't debate. At all. That's the conversation which apparently you didn't know you entered into.
Joe Biden started this thing, he said if you're black and you don't vote for him you're not black. Now he started this trend where liberals think they can talk to black folks any old way. Fuck em!!ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I would pay a lot of money, instead of a debate, to watch a Bible trivia match between Biden and Trump.
Before Biden Backed Out of Speech, COVID Was Detected at Convention Site  via
While speakers won't be in attendance at the Democratic National Convention, protesters still plan on being there.
The DNC concerns me, regardless of whether or not Biden will be here.
You couldn't pay me a million dollars to vote for Biden.
Daily Beast: Before Biden Backed Out of DNC Speech, COVID-19 Was Detected at Convention Site
Electing Biden is going to hurt god? Sign me up, Ive wanted to take that beardy fucker down a peg or two for years.
Shit not me I'm voting Green. I'm not going to continue repeating the same fucked up mistakes black folks have been making the last 40+years. Not much is going to change between Trump and Biden. Until black folks start recognizing that we'll continue to be treated the same way.
Joe Biden or not, protesters still plan on sending message in Milwaukee during DNC
Joe Biden Sez "Keep Your Nose Clean to Beat COVID-19!"
The surprising thing is that so many of our country men and women fall for that. Biden should challenge him on 2 Corinthians.
Milwaukee WI... the one place Biden will not be any day soon... lol
That's great.  Ignore the Trump supporters.  Most of us here in the US want Biden to win out of the two choices.  The Trump supporters are more vocal unfortunately.
Convention organizers said the positive tests did not trigger announcement that speakers, including Joe Biden, would not be traveling to Milwaukee.
Joe Biden or not, protesters still plan on sending message in Milwaukee during DNC
He brought up the fact that I talk a lot of shit about about Obama. Obama and Biden deserve criticism they're not above it. Yeah Biden can't stand on his own 2 feet, ordinary people can't see his weakness for some reason.
Guise. Biden isn't fooling anyone. He's just getting away with it right now. But the narrative is out there that's he's mentally unfit and afraid to challenge Trump in a public debate. There is zero chance America elects someone who hides from a fight.
Democrats Urging Biden Not to Debate TrumpDemocrats Urging Biden Not to Debate Trump Can‚Äôt let the people know Biden has lost his marbles.
Kind of pathetic if you don‚Äôt say why you discount voting for a Biden-Rice ticket over a Biden-Harris ticket after saying what you are saying about Trump, then you are saying Trump for four more years is OK and you undercut the entire premise of your assertion.
It's almost like people don't realize the polls reflect opinion of public Trump and private Biden. At some point the campaign will begin in earnest and the Biden oppo will be savage. And by oppo I mean the the stuff he says himself out loud. This cave routine has a shelf life.
Well at least he {biden} didn't bust up peaceful protesters with flash bangs for photo op. No   we will not forget. A special thanks to media you try shutting down!
i honestly can't even muster the energy to be mad at joe biden. truly a nonentity.
No loyalty there,Biden girl,Excepts Mark of the beastWisconsin Young Black Voters 'Not Sold On Biden, Democratic Party'
This bullshit again? US intelligence warns of election interference, says Russia is trying to denigrate Biden, China wants Trump to lose
Why are we pretending Joe Biden ever even thought any of this let alone tweeted it?  We all know he spent most of the rest of the day after tha interview resting and having Jill feed him Yankee Bean soup
Trump saying biden is against the bible and god makes me actually wanna get behind biden
Yeah, African Americans came from a variety of countries, but overtime the minority has been able to form a more homogeneous census than those of Hispanic roots. I honestly don‚Äôt see how what Biden said was ‚Äúracist‚Äù or ‚Äúproves he has dementia‚Äù I see it to be pretty factual.
Biden should reiterate this.
So Mordecai Lee says that because Joe Biden has such a commanding lead in the polls, he doesn‚Äôt need to give a traditional convention acceptance speech. #KeepingJoeInTheBasement
Any vote they can take away from Biden is a vote for Trump.  They know they can only win by cheating and they are leaving no stone unturned.
I give you credit for not hiding your serious dislike of cops. Liberals forever have hated cops, but had to lie in public. Unfortunately Biden is going to pretend to support law enforcement, while he sends his team to campaign with promises of doing the opposite
Biden's afraid of his problems being revealed for the world to see...
If Biden opts out of the debates or makes excuses to get out of them, how can someone vote for him?  The office of the President is too important not to have debates. I don‚Äôt think Biden can handle it.
Joe Biden, other speakers will not travel to Milwaukee for 2020 DNC - Milwaukee Business Journal ‚Å¶ This could be great news because the last Democrat POTUS candidate who blew off Wisconsin LOST! #KeepingJoeInTheBasement
We have over 100 field staff in the Badger State. Joe Biden continues to abandon the Badger State day after day. Our field staff is out engaging with the community every day.   Ask yourself, which candidate has put the investment in to care about the needs of Wisconsinites?
Any ETA on sign drop offs? My Biden sign is getting lonely‚Ä¶ ;)
I‚Äôd definitely vote for her. Definitely for President. #SusanRice
Who can‚Äôt sleep after that AZ primary and Kanye working to take votes away from #Biden?  Im getting nervous.
Ya'll are missing it. Biden's running mate will be Oprah.
That's not a reasonable comparison. Biden has been in national politics for over 40 years &amp; Trump has 4 years.  BTW no one is really doing backflips about the choices. It really is the choice of the lesser of 2 evils.  I know the right isn't always interested in facts or numbers.
Did you really just tell me to ignore the soundbites and post a picture full of soundbites? Plus, Biden was 1 of 100 senators and 1 of 535 congressmen during that time as opposed to 1 of 1 presidents.
I predict Biden down by 3, Greenfield up by 1.
In the past, they didn't announce their V.P. pick til a few days b4 the Convention.  I wish the Media &amp; Everyone else just Leave Biden alone!!  He'll make the announcement when he's ready too!!  #Biden2020  #VoteBlueNov2020
In the conservative Wisconsin zip code of 53186, Biden has out-raised Trump. And my ultra-conservative 53188 is not far behind!
I have seen Biden signs in conservative areas. No Trump signs in liberal areas.  Conclusion?
Because Biden is an extension of the things that have made 2020 scariest.
Saw a Biden sign outside a wealthy lawyers home. I'm thinking real hard about it.
Even elected governors from his own party have been biding their time jumping on the Biden Bandwagon üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Based on the Kavanaugh standard set by Democrat Members of Senate, I‚Äôd have to say yes.  Is that still their standard or did Joe Biden change all that?

Trump is the biggest sinner I know.  He has no right to slam Biden about his religion.  Biden goes to church faithfully, does he?  No , he would rather chase pussy, cheat, lie, bullies handicapped people and Gold Star families... what a piece of dirt!
Yes! There are many of us! Unfortunately, we must be diligent until Biden is president and implements a national plan to contain the pandemic. #BlueTsunami2020
Sorry Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is not black/
I am really worried about Biden hurting God. On the other hand, I am pretty sure that Trump is a total nutcase.
I am. Better safe than sorry. The pandemic will be with us until Joe Biden is president and implements a national plan to contain the virus. #BlueTsunami2020
No. Many of us are still only going out for necessities. This won‚Äôt end until we vote this incompetent regime out and Joe Biden and the Dems take control! #DumpTrump2020 and all his corrupt Republican sycophants! #GoJoe2020 #BlueTsunami2020
1) it's wild that we have a candidate who has to walk things back. Has to clarify. Has to apologise. Meanwhile, the other one just lies without remorse or recourse.  2) Biden wasn't, and isn't a good candidate and it kills me that he's what Democrats have to rally around.
Attention..biden does not like people of color don't believe him he just wants people of color to vote for him .just wants the vote.!!! Don't do it..he said it through the years...don't trust any Democratic at this time in politics.its not the old democrats party vote TRUMP2020 !
Maybe have the debates in Nambia or Thighland hey? Or possibly Yo- Semite National Park. Your father has dementia and is a drug addict to boot ... FO with the Biden talk.
Well if she votes for Biden she won't be a billionaire for long
Joe Biden's huge advantage is that people feel sorry for him. In today's culture, that may be enough to tide him over
If that the case, Biden‚Äôs priorities are scewed.
Biden is so racist that the only black president ever chose him as a running mate and he is on record starting he will pick a black vp. Sure he lost the black vote. Lmfao

This is too bizaare for words, after west &amp; his plastic surgery laden wife bedded down in the WH with Trump few months ago, Don't you find this odd? All West is doing is trying to pull votes from Biden. He's still in bed with Trump , my learned opinion!üí©

Once again Joe Biden &amp; Democrats shine, with their sincere care for people. Be sure to know where &amp; how you can vote. Report any irregularities that you see or suspect, 2 the Voting office in your community, it may be under City Clerks heading. But we will dump Trump 4 democracy
NEXT Biden needs to Tell MR DONALD J TRUMP, THAT HE'LL DO A TEST IF DJT YOU SHOW THE US CITIZENS YOUR PAST 8 YEARS OR TAXES.
Looks like you took care of this discussion. I don't see evidence but third party votes made a difference in 2016. When it comes to candidates, dissatisfaction with Biden seems different than dissatisfaction with Clinton.   Still, just in case, mothballing the Yeezys for now.
Yeah but does the Biden campaign have one of these?
Not to defend Biden but from what I‚Äôve read he has a stutter and that‚Äôs why some of these interviews end up like this.

I always enjoy when the actual Joe Biden dips his toe into Onion Joe Biden.
Trump‚Äôs a classic projector.  When did Trump start calling Biden sleepy-J? Probably about the time this caught attention.
There is little question in my mind that Joe Biden is suffering some level of cognitive disorder. As one who has experienced family members with this problem, I have great empathy for him. He knows he has a problem. He should withdraw for his sake and that of his family, and us.
No! We want debate! Joe Biden has an atomic bomb of incompetence to drop on Trump! No previous nominee has had so much to use against an incombant!
No! Trump barely won the Midwest in 16 &amp; is running behind Joe Biden. I live in Wisconsin. Joe will win the Midwest and the Electoral College. We already know he has the popular vote tied down. America is sick of Trump‚Äôs incompetence and corruption!
So....none of those things are true i guess, as your rebuttal is a bad meme.   Cool.   You know that trump/Biden ‚Äúgaffes,‚Äù are so egregiously skewed, it‚Äôs not a fair fight, right?   Oh well, ‚Äúit is what it is.‚Äù #ItIsWhatItIs
‚úãA vote for Biden is a vote against Republican fascist tyranny!
Are you kidding? If you can‚Äôt see the obvious difference between Biden &amp; Trump you best go have the test yourself....you‚Äôre not rational.
No. Biden must debate Trump or it looks bad. Biden holds all the cards, as Trump has crashed the economy and is responsible for tens of thousands of American deaths with his failed response to a global pandemic.
WI GOP follows: ‚ÄúJoe Biden has not visited the state of Wisconsin once this year and now is using coronavirus concerns as an excuse for his absence despite recent travel to other states.‚Äù
That I did. I always think I can get some of you folks to see the light, but you are in pretty deep at this point with the MAGA line. Tweet me on 11/4, seriously. Should be interesting, either way! I‚Äôd like to think Biden has this, but you can never sleep on the Trumper!
Trust me. You‚Äôre being fed a line of sensational shit; this is politics. He won‚Äôt, it won‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs ridiculous. As a former Cop, current lawyer, I can assure you, cooler heads will prevail, but we need the constant disruption and chaos to stop first. Biden is our only hope.
Defunding the police is an idiotic idea; Biden has no intention of doing that. Don‚Äôt worry, we got this. Seriously, it‚Äôs going to turn out fine.
Ummmm, Biden is a moderate, centrist Democrat. Relax. Lay off the energy drinks and mushrooms, take off the diaper, go upstairs and get some air.
...when the reality is, Biden is the best possible scenario. We need calm, steady and rational thinking moderate back in the Whitehouse! Bernie is a nice man but his ideas weren‚Äôt financially realistic, and Tulsi is kind of a nut. That‚Äôs not what America needs right now!
I truly hope the debates focus on constitutional law, and foreign policy. I hope they actually make them ANSWER questions directly related to what a President should know, and not let them bullshit, dance and spin their way through the process. If they do, Biden wins, hands down.
No he hasn‚Äôt. He lives under the rock of the moment; listens to the shit his right winger buddies feed him, all the while saying he‚Äôs ‚Äúa liberal‚Äù. ‚ÄúBiden has Demntia‚Äù is a meme for bro‚Äôs, so Rogan is on board. He won‚Äôt listen to the speeches, it doesn‚Äôt fit the bro‚Äô narrative.
C‚Äômon man. Biden is ready to go on the debates, ready and raring. I would think someome with your brain and ability to think out of the box, someome who shills snake oil called Alpha Brain, would have the clarity to stay the fuck out of this, till you hear the debates??

Vulgar trump supporters, if they say ‚ÄúI hate Trump but i am not voting for Biden".
Evers, in a statement announcing the endorsement, promised to do everything he could to get Biden elected
Always hard to predict how people will react, but I would think if Biden refuses to debate, then people will not vote for him. Such a refusal would be an admission that Biden cannot stand on his two feet and spit out good answers that are intelligible.
If they figured Biden could out-debate Trump, they‚Äôd be giddy with anticipation for them!

When Joe Biden gains control of US management, let's ask for Congress to set term limits on them. States should do the same. We see how long McConnell has reighned over Kentucky, because he rigs 'stuff'! Mitch took Russian money too. Did his people real any rewards from this?
I do not believe any campaign race is close. Geeziz even the racists in America must be feeling Trump's abuse by now. Even though North Carolina is in my opinion a state full of corruption, their must be more sensible people than idiots. Go Joe! üá∫üá∏
It's clear to all of us in America that we cannot continue trying to live under Trump's cruel racist, tyranny!  Obama chose Biden because he has an honest &amp; earnest concern for people in America. Joe looks at the overall situations in US, then plans ahead
Biden just has to be like, you can have Tik Tok back and Gen X RUNS
You might as well just say ‚Äúvote for Biden‚Äù. Honestly, a ham sandwich would do a better job at running the country than you.
No. The choice is clear: Joe Biden equals unity and democracy. Trump equals chaos and fascist tyranny.
Biden should say he will debate Trump when Trump releases his taxes. Not a day sooner. #DumpTrump2020
True! We need Joe Biden and Democrats to turn the economy around AGAIN! Why would anyone vote for Republicans when they only seem good at crashing the economy?!
Please steer clear of  as your VP. Embracing and praising the sick cult of Scientology is dangerous for our country.
I mentally called a Biden/Harris ticket the second he entered the race and I should‚Äôve written that shit down eons ago so that I could be properly smug about it next week, but I guess I wanted to pretend the Dem establishment wasn‚Äôt going to be itself.
Or his words - I mean really?? Biden over Trump any day. Hell my 5 mo puppy over Trump makes more sense
Biden had better make a top flight choice for VP. We, and I have been a Trump supporter, are waiting. Given what I see of Mr. Biden, as few times I see him, I look at his VP choice as a better than 50-50 chance to replace him during his first tour of duty.

But first biden and obama and clinton hmmm
Maybe wishful thinking. Has anyone considered the speech Biden would give at inauguration? ‚ÄúOk America, first thing let‚Äôs stop being racist....like that guy.‚Äù I thought Obama calling out Bush in 2008 was uncomfortable. Trump probably won‚Äôt attend just for this reason. Yay?
"Doesn't want his job". Since there is almost zero chance Biden serves a second term shouldn't he be concerned with picking his successor?
Best move Biden could make is promise to not use Twitter. Let Press Secretary do their job and communicate to the country.
It‚Äôs ok to settle for Biden! You‚Äôre voting for human decency &amp; a greater America when Trump is gone!!! #DumpTrump
Joe Biden has a sound mind, decent heart n soul üá∫üá∏
Just keep telling yourself your own lies, Donny. You are done in American government. You are done with using and abusing people in US. We will be America again once Joe Biden is at the hrlmüá∫üá∏
I personally thank Joe Biden for this day of recognition for the survivors and let's help those people still in bondage üò≠üíõ
Trump is coward, he's facing lots of charges from states &amp; private civil suits and I believe when Joe Biden sits in WH, he will discover many crimes against Americans that we don't know about now
Parents be like: ‚Äúlook we‚Äôre just concerned voting for Biden and the Democrats will make our country more socialist!‚Äù  Me: ‚ÄúGOOD!‚Äù
In the latest Fox News poll of PA, Trump lead Biden in white no college by +10, he beat Hillary +37.
I wanted  but the morons on the left cut her down. I‚Äôm luke-warm on Biden, but I just wish we had someone closer to our age. A little youthful energy.  I‚Äôm headed back to school on August 10, students start 2 weeks later. It‚Äôs almost go time!!!!!
We all must ride with Biden, he's a human being with a normal mind. Trump's been given more money, without doing anything but supplying the parties. Not how good businesses are developed that  have staying power. One by one the traitors will be uncloked
DNC organizers tell  Biden‚Äôs VP pick will be speaking in Milwaukee Wednesday night of convention week. Biden will be in Milwaukee Thursday to accept the nomination
He kind of nailed this prediction. You want to admit Biden was right or you to ‚Äúproud‚Äù to admit it?
Hey Nate, does it seem like the Biden campaign is being smarter than the Clinton campaign was regarding these kinds of tactical moves? Seems that way to me
Lots of Obama-Trump voters in Youngstown and Toledo. Biden is probably already doing well with voters in the three Cs and this might be a test run to see if they can persuade enough voters in the mid sized cities to flip Ohio backLakeside Park Master Plan forum last night - get the run down; Biden will not accept the democrat nomination in Milw - hear from a delegate; Secretary of the WI Econ Devt Corp will be on today's show and the latest corona virus numbers in FDL.
America is in shambles because of you! All you and no one else! VOTE FOR BIDEN!Biden cant speak in coherant sentences.
Biden would just show his taxes
It makes sense this would be on cnn. Liberals would drink hand sanitizer. They must know everything yet live in an echo chamber that ignores reality just as much as it punishes those who try to learn through history. Dunning krueger effect... i mean they are going to vote biden.
‚Å¶ won't travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination - The Washington Post (stay in your basement forever!)
True that.
And you all want a guy who hides in his basement and has been around Washington for 5 decades who loves communist China. Biden is not the answer. He doesn‚Äôt even know where he is, yet you ppl want him as the next president. Makes no sense
So you guys just disregard the hundreds of thousands of woman and children  saved from being trafficked. You also haven't seen any of the hundreds of videos of Joe Biden smelling woman and children. As well as him touching them in a way they look uncomfortable!
Don‚Äôt flatter yourself....worst president ever....sorry I wasted my vote!!! Riden with Biden!!
I just responded to a #SleepyJoe poll.  When asked if I would vote for #biden I answered no.  Then asked about all the important concerns of the dumbocrats i answered "other" and typed in #Trump2020 the box.  If they didn't wanna know, they shouldn't have asked. #sorrynotsorry
Joe Biden has some frontal lobe damage, no doubt.
Yes, she did! And for Obama, too!

I really hope so.  Even if Trump loses the popular vote he can still win if the electoral college votes for him like they did last time.  Hopefully with the high number of corona cases, they'll vote for Biden.
SPINNING employment numbers to DISTRACT about the RECESSION. At least 11.1% unemployment rate. Obama/Biden handed INCOMPETENT  75 months in a row job growth &amp; a 4.7% unemployment rate. TRUMP FAILING AMERICA! #VoteJoeBiden2020
#PutinPuppet  working with Russia to undermined  with an Oct. news breaker. Don‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs a hoax. Johnson wasting tax payers money. The Biden‚Äôs been investigated with Ukraine dealings &amp; was cleared. #FactsMatter
America or Trump! Anyone Biden picks is better than tool Pence. Besides good chance psychopath  will throw Pence under the bus. Blame FAIL COVID19 &amp; take suck up Nikki Haley.
I would pay a lot of money, instead of a debate, to watch a Bible trivia match between Biden and Trump.
Joe Biden Sez "Keep Your Nose Clean to Beat COVID-19!"
That's great.  Ignore the Trump supporters.  Most of us here in the US want Biden to win out of the two choices.  The Trump supporters are more vocal unfortunately.
All of this ‚ÄúBiden is a good Catholic‚Äù talk is gonna get testy when/if they start talking about how Biden officiated a homosexual marriage in the WH while VP, continues to support PP/abortion/‚Äúa woman‚Äôs choice,‚Äù etc.,
Always worth reminding ourselves that HRC was in a similar (if not as dominant) position four years ago.  She spent a lot of time away from the campaign trail, and ignored states that she eventually lost.  There are lessons for Biden to learn from that.
To syphon off votes from Joe Biden. Does that sound like a successful plan to you?
Yup. Rush called him Plugs Biden for years.
TRANSLATION: "Evangelical Christians are stupid."  Biden campaign faith director talks Christian beliefs, outreach to evangelicals and systemic racism
With Biden not coming to Milwaukee anymore here is the only attendee to the DNC.
I understand the lure of getting preemptively mad about Kanye siphoning off votes from Biden, but maybe Biden should actually appeal to these voters instead of assuming he‚Äôs entitled to their votes?
Biden is completely on board with all of that and more.
To get the support of Bernie's followers, Biden has essentially adopted the entire Sanders agenda.  It's as radical and leftist as it gets....a complete destruction of the U.S. as we know it, and of what it has always been.
With help of a GOP election lawyer, and all 10 independent electors who are Republicans, Kanye West got enough signatures to get on the ballot in Wisconsin.   Republicans think Black folks will vote for Kanye and siphon votes from  Biden. That‚Äôs systematic racism
a vol just asked me for biden‚Äôs personal email address i gotta go y‚Äôall lmfao üò≠üò≠üò≠
Yeah that's not going to happen.  The third party candidate never wins and a vote for anyone other than Biden, is a vote for Trump.
As much as all these reasons are true... there‚Äôs not a single reason I should vote for biden.  But okay, yeah. I‚Äôll vote for him. I don‚Äôt want to, but I will üôÑ
Sean the only person that will debate is Biden‚Äôs VP choice! Dems will do whatever to hide Joe
"during a virtual campaign fundraiser on Monday, Biden said he believed Trump would do everything in his power to "argue this election is fraudulent."  Unlike Hillary.    Biden assails Trump for 'bald-faced lies' about voting by mail
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have the same curiosity on Biden if you could ever get around the socialist handlers!
CORRUPT  investigating the Obama administration &amp; Biden, regardless of his denial, just for an October story. This investigation is OBSTRUCTING Sen. bill 3627 proposal of Medical Supply Transparency &amp; Delivery Act for supplies to hospitals.
What‚Äôs an election without the debates??? Get some balls Biden!!!
Now let's play the Biden clips and see who makes the most sense.
How ironic.  Your Soros Bot meme exactly describes Joe Biden and nearly every Democrat politician in the country.
PARTY OF CORRUPTION &amp; LIES check out FBI report on goggle.  NEVER SAID to defund the police. #FactCheck that! Psychopath  last quarter 32.9% GDP DROP RECESSION! Obama/Biden had 75 months job growth handed to Trump!
So you support Biden?  Hi, Traitor!
Obama is in his head. Psychopath  can‚Äôt beat Obama/Biden 75 months in a row job growth. Trump trashed it with his GDP 32.9% DROP. Obama handled 4 pandemics. COVID19 is out of control. TRUMP FAILED AMERICA. Obama ranked 12th BEST PRESIDENT!
All Trump volunteers should go on the 'sly' and wear Biden buttons in groups standing in lines. Trump supporters in Biden clothing. False sense if security
I should of said if Biden was having a rally haha
He's just an angry liberal, if Herman Cain Died going to a democratic or Biden's rally, you would hear nothing from them and wouldnt blame Biden. Its funny how easy it is for them to blame the fault always on the same person. When this guy knows in reality it was Herman's choice
What!?   "Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"  The binary choice of Biden &amp; Trump #fail   Give a third party a chance:  VOTE   on 3rd of November!
I've been talking to fellow Midwesterners about MN, and my theory is that the types of non-college whites Biden appeals to are the blue collar PA types, but MN non-college whites are the north woods type cut from a very different cloth, thus MN is coming back to the Midwest packBiden can comfortably say whatever he wants to say because people like you will always come to his aid. Am sure if it was a "R" that was at the back of his name you will be taking a different position
If Bernie was the Democratic candidate, I would vote for him. However, with what we have, I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Hey, I like him! Biden is the closet pedophile though...well, actually the out in the open pedophile (they‚Äôll blame it on his dementia)
How do I vote for the version of Joe Biden that Trump thinks he is?
Bleh, msnbc is making hay out of Biden's comments yesterday. üò™
There are two reasons I'm voting for Joe Biden: 1. KAMALA asked me to. 2. More people will die if we don't get rid of trump and I'm not a complete asshole.
Save your tweet, because Biden‚Äôs apologies will be coming often. He can‚Äôt make a single statement that doesn‚Äôt cause people to scratch their heads.The question remains are these his real feelings or is his dimentia getting worse.If he‚Äôs going to become President, we need to know!
There is a great irony Donald Trump claiming that Biden "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God."   Plus bonus points for conflating being "against God and against guns."
If the DNC really wanted to get rid of Trump they wouldn't have run such a weak candidate and supported such a lame platform.  So don't blame me for what is totally at the feet of the DNC.  If they pull off a Biden win they will have to do it without me.  #DemExit
I'm petty and I want Harris to appear in larger print than Biden on all the merch.
Holy shit, Biden is a JRPG protagonist?
This is why I buy merch. Soon as he announces her this suburban is going to become the Biden/Harris mobile.
11% of all US VPs were ever elected POTUS.  Whoever Biden picks has a very low chance of being elected POTUS.  20% of all US VPs assumed office when the president died in office.
Joe Biden says he‚Äôs ‚Äúdefinitely going‚Äù to gods show, watches Frasier dvd instead.
Joe Biden pinches gods thigh way too hard
Trump says electing Biden will ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù  Clearly Trump hasn‚Äôt read the Bible.
Lol. Who needs stand-up comedians when we have Trump and Biden on tv every day ü§£
Joe Biden Punches God
Biden ‚Äúgaffes‚Äù vs #TrumpIsNotWell and #TrumpVirusCatastrophe: I‚Äôll take #GoJoe2020 without hesitation.
OMG. Wise up. Biden won‚Äôt call it a hoax or say it will magically go away or tell people to take disproven drugs or tell states to open up when cases are rising. Biden has already said he‚Äôll let the scientists take the lead.
The trump signs came yesterday when an old white dude on a three wheeled scooter went door to door asking to place signs.  The biden campaign is not going door to door. That means biden supporter are mad enough to go get their own signs.
I am once again saying fuck Pete, Klobuchar, Biden, and a special shout out hate to Warren üòò
She will but I'm worried that overconfidence will be Biden's downfall. Nothing has damaged him so he probably thinks Susan will have the same immunity by being part of the team.
I'm starting to get really concerned that Joe Biden is going to pick Susan Rice because she's the "safe" choice and she won't outshine him. I think we need to stop being safe and start fighting.
That's why I'm trying to escape to the desert and live off the grid. I can't take much more of this and I trust the Biden administration to get shit back on track. I need a break.
Ari Fleischer is suggesting the same thing you are about Biden and the debates!

Say it ain't so, Joe!--Joe Biden no longer coming to Milwaukee for Democratic National Convention
BREAKING: Joe Biden no longer expected to accept the Democratic nomination in Milwaukee.
This shit guarantees a black VEEP. Biden/Harris for the win
Ignore Trump and go hard after Biden's VEEP. 2016 redux
The fact that Joe Biden, his team and the former Obama admin staffers are really considering someone as VP with no campaigning experience and no ambition to be president scares the crap out of me. This win is not guaranteed and we're going to have to fight like hell. C'mon man.
A Ukraine company gaining favor with the Obama WH by hiring the Biden‚Äôs son is just a tad different than a US official having connections to the Trump WH and getting his job a son. There are no national defense implications there. You don‚Äôt see the difference?
It's 2024 and Biden still hasn't picked his VP.
If Obama is Blue Reagan it follows then that Biden is Blue Bush.
That's nice. President Biden will do it, too.
The fact that Joe Biden's Deputy campaign manager told us to calm down about the timing of his VP announcement does not inspire confidence.
Try again.
I can dislike E dubs for her cultural appropriation, tone deafness, centering of upper middle class white people and unrealistic plans and also hate Republicans. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I can dislike her for the VP job and still vote for Joe Biden if he makes the electoral mistake of picking her.
Oop Eugene Robinson said Joe Biden ought to tell his committee to shut up and enforce it.
To the people arguing that Joe Biden doesn't have to pick a black woman as a running mate because he promised to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court, shut the entire fuck up.
Wisconsin Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is endorsing Joe Biden for president.
These videos from this site are SO cringy... Ya, believe Wamun until one of them accuses Biden of Rape... Reid testified under oath (meaning if she lied, it's perjury), Brett's accuser never went under oath and dropped the whole media stunt when it became an obvious lie.
Calling me a Trumpster is like someone from my side of the isle calling a Bernie bro a Biden fan. In your TDS-addled mind, anyone who gives Trump even ONE positive point is a Trumpster.
You need to educate yourself on the individuals that comprise the Lincoln Project. Although they have disagreements with Biden on policy, they understand Trump threatens our democracy. They are patriots who are putting country over party.
Gov. Evers throws support behind Joe Biden for president
Who are we talking about, Biden or Trump? J/k! Trump "admitted" to having had sex with a woman who wanted to willingly have sex with him and then he ran for Prez and thought, despite JFK and Clinton before him, America wasn't ready for an openly SWINGER prez., so he paid hush$.
I am starting to think that the Biden campaign will wait until the start of the convention, August 17th, to announce the VP pick.
What that Biden's biggest quality among liberals is that he's not Trump? I saw that the other day. Sad. That the top 3 qualities most liberals love about Biden is that 1: He's 2. Not. 3. Trump. That is truly sad and wholey unconvincing. Trump's gonna win again. (y)
WI tossup? Polls there look pretty good for Biden no?
Jill Biden.  Then Jill as POTUS picks Chelsea Clinton.  As so it goes for eternity
He can't remember their names... Hey, how about CornPop 4 VP?! If Biden's so senile that his VP will be running the show, I'd trust an imaginary character over any Dem.
liberals to this thread of comments are like flies on shit, holy crap! If I wasn't ready to eat, I could spend all night scrolling down and calling each of them out on whatever dumb shit they're saying... muh rushunz, Biden is good b/c.... uhm.... he's not Trump... etc
Let them defend themselves. I'm done. All I'm doing for a Biden/Warren ticket is voting.
Well ultimately I can't speak to whether he does or not. That is just the point of the person that started this thread is trying to get across. The fact that he's tweeting about worrying about Joe biden's tweets, while isn't an indicator in itself, contributes to a pattern of
Bill of course.  But Biden is as bad.
True.   Biden sucks.
So you're admitting to the fact that old school liberals... like racist Biden, we're in on all that shit...
If the Biden campaign didn't know that the #KHive wasn't giving them any money unless and until they announced Kamala as Biden's running mate, I'm pretty sure they know after this week.  You guys are the best ü§©
Joe Biden wouldn't ban tik tok.
The leading contenders include California Sen. Kamala Harris, California Rep. Karen Bass and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice.
This is hilarious, we all know why Biden "shouldn't" debate Trump... Biden fumbles over himself all the time, how can you have a proper dabte when Biden needs a teleprompter and pre-arranged questions? Maybe Trump will correct him and say "Arizona is a state, Joe."

Biden marches in the same direction as conservatives.   He just does it marching backwards.
I think Joe Biden knew that Kamala Harris could have beaten him. You could tell by the look on his face when that reporter told him she suspended her campaign. The only question is will he try to team up with her or is he afraid of her?
Also fuck Joe Biden and everyone whose actions put me in a position where I'm gonna have to vote for him.
Could you imagine how the aging Joe Biden would handle it. Of course, the goal is not for Biden to sit four years. They will remove him and replace him with his VP as soon as it is convenient.
Right. And Joe Biden is no Hillary Clinton. He needs someone MORE dynamic and electorally accomplished.
I'm still convinced that Biden won because he was thought appeal to white people.
Are they (the Biden team) actively courting only women who they don't see as a threat to his authority?
Please explain to me why most of the women thought to be on Biden's short list for VP didn't run for president themselves. If the most important qualification is ready to be president on day one, why didn't they run themselves?
My mom asked me about her the other day. I said she's a congresswoman from California, she's the CBC chair and she's stated that she doesn't want to run for president. Mom said oh, VP probably isn't the right position for her, especially given Biden's age. üò¨

Biden screwed up because he‚Äôs too old and too white to know how to answer properly. He is not however racist and cruel like Trump. It simply illustrates why Biden needs a person of color as his VP. He doesn‚Äôt know how to reach them alone.

So, as my husband continues to volunteer for the Greendale WI Dems, he ended up calling a first time voter, and she thinks Trump's a dick, but is very frustrated that she has to choose between two creepy old pedophiles this fall.  He marked her as "Leaning Biden".
While my husband is volunteering for the Dems, he ended up on a call with a Republican who is voting for Biden in November. It was a GREAT conversation.  GREAT conversation. His number one issue was healthcare, and the effects of children going back to school during covid.

Each nuclear power plant employs 500 to 1,000 workers. Building a nuclear power reactor employs up to 3,500 workers at peak construction. Nuclear worker salaries are 20 percent higher on average than those of other electricity generation sources.
I am so humbled that you replyed to me! I retweet practically everything you post. And I hope that in the future it‚Äôs something all people in a bipartisan way open up that idea. It would create energy production plants in practically any state no just in the south or west
Oh no absolutely not. It‚Äôs more of a potential long term goal. Definitely not during an election. But year 2 while working on climate change and the health of workers, and people wanting skilled jobs that pay more, to look at that more.
How to safely dispose of the nuclear waste. They recommend to use massive metal shed buried deep far underground that are sealed and then to put the barrels in it so as to keep the waste out of the environment and away from nefarious characters
The several disasters like Chernobyl and Japan happened to because of man made errors or natural disasters due to location. So it‚Äôs about place. Also it provides thousands of different skill level jobs. From manual labor to engineers, construction, and land workers to deal with
And do it in advance, we can prepare to transition workers so they will have job continuity.  It‚Äôs controversial but the best alternative for mass energy production is nuclear energy. The issue is it needs to be regulated extensively
1/ Also I have written research papers about fracking and the dangers of it to small communities. It causes issues with the land and water and most towns end up becoming ghost towns after a period of time. If we work to find alternatives
Susan Rice is headed to jail.  Kamala threatened all Americans who supported Trump if Biden wins, plus her past is so filthy.
I just saw you interviewing Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos Jim I think you have the Joe Biden syndrome,time you stepped down.They're covering for the Biden gaff!
Biden needs a race relations interpreter.   He‚Äôs not entirely wrong if you take into context with Hispanics.  I‚Äôve heard more complaints about his reference to Hispanics
Nobody is defending Biden.
For the record, FUCK JOE BIDEN
Nah the ‚Äúresisters‚Äù are going back to their wine caves if we get Biden in.  Then we strike
Conservatives be like "Biden is racist too" and ABSOLUTELY but what's your point????? We don't like Biden either but we're settling????? Just because someone else who has a different political orientation than you is racist doesn't absolve the fact that Trump is a bigot! Go away!
And replace the name Biden with Trump and we have the present  reality!
For the sake of gender equality, I wonder how many men Joe Biden has spoken with regarding being his VP?
If the leak from Biden insiders is accurate
Biden‚Äôs inspired me, I want to punch the Bible. Which version of the Bible should I punch?
Well Biden‚Äôs got my vote because I‚Äôm against energy as well. Up with Joe!! Down with electricity!!!
That‚Äôs fine, but Biden also has a responsibility to uphold his commitment to live out the teachings of the Catholic faith that he likes to flaunt.  Trump too with his evangelical faith.
Is Biden delaying picking a VP as long as possible in hopes that the Durham indictments will drop first???
Biden had 40 years. Nothing.
You mean traitors for Biden. What you going to say when Biden shreads the 2nd Amendment, and removes the Electoral College not to mention packing the SCOTUS?

No, the Postal Workers Union is backing Biden. Not the same thing. The USPS is a government service, they can not support a candidate anymore than the FBI or CIA can. Take your ignorance elsewhere and let the Senator do her job, please.
Nikki Haley probably has a much better chance of beating Biden than Trump does at this point.  An indictment, which gives us a shot at a  /  ticket in 2020 would be an absolute gift.
fwiw hard to imagine tish james will indict trump.  DNC goal is to hurt Trump, but not force him from the race. Avg democrat is less supportive of biden, than wants trump out of office. Avg republican is less supportive of trump, than wants to keep antifa out of power

There are many many reasons to support  but I also love that he is a gearhead.  Biden has a plan to Build Back Better because we can come out of this crisis stronger.  I‚Äôm running to serve in Congress to help make that happen.
I‚Äôm anti trump.  I think that Biden is an useful idiot that we can use.  I‚Äôd rather have incremental change than nothing as well.  If the greens get over that 5% cool, but I think it would be much easier to retake the party with progressives than trying to sell something new
Meanwhile  is profiting from conspiracy mongerers accusing israel of literally nuking Beirut.     I guess in your book #hateforprofit is okay as long as the profiteer is working to rig the election to biden?
We‚Äôre all with you. We know Biden is a idiot and fraud. We love you üòç Mr president Trump. Hugs my friend. ü§ó ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let‚Äôs not celebrate too loudy.  Still have to get through 3 November 2020 election and if Biden wins don‚Äôt expect 2022 to be a cake walk!
I really don‚Äôt see Kanye as a threat to Biden or causing African-Americans to vote Kanye.  It‚Äôs a stunt. A few idiots will vote for him.
I still think there's a chance Biden won't be the nominee. They can't do signs and knocking and stuff until they have a real nominee and VP pick.  We'll see what happens at the convention.
Isn't that what #TrumpsGestapo did in Portland?  Why does he and his followers always say that's what Biden will do?
Mass mail in voting helps  manage his enthusiasm gap: An unenthusiastic biden voter might not take the time to go to the polls but s/he will fill out a mail in ballot  If the enthusiasm gap was other way  would be far more skeptical of mail in voting

Oh well with Biden‚Äôs record he doesn‚Äôt deserve a chance in the exact same way trump never deserved a chance
Will Joe Biden debate Donald Trump?
I really don‚Äôt see Biden as a facist.  He‚Äôs authoritarian definitely
Biden has people tweet for him!
I watched the debates and HE, not his lackeys writing for him, but HE could not articulate a vision.  Biden can‚Äôt articulate much of anything these days.  I don‚Äôt know who I am voting for yet.  The choices are abysmal.  No real 3rd party candidate either.
Ima leftist that hates Biden so much that I have to lie like a right winger so people will join me in my hatred.  I‚Äôll also be like a liberal and vote shame them to vote third party.  I‚Äôm smart
Why would I vote for a man with zero vision, brazenly lied straight through his teeth during the final debate with Bernie, Biden has been all over the map politically within the last 12 months, has no core values left, is a perpetual gaffe machine, and is suffering from dementia?
If trump didn‚Äôt keel over neither will Biden
I haven‚Äôt decided who I am voting for yet.  It is a shame Bernie couldn‚Äôt do a better job of exposing Biden for being an absurd liar in the last debate.  Bernie looked dumbfounded at Biden‚Äôs brazen lies.
BIDEN CANNOT STAY AWAKE THAT LONG - TOO MANY QUESTIONS WILL MAKE HIM CRY - HE CANNOT COMPLETE A RATIONAL RESPONSE WITHOUT RAMBLING ABOUT EVERYTHING AND NOTHING üëèYES NUTRODS ARE AFRAID OF SHOWING HOW INCOMPETENT HE IS
So your saying the American people get to choose between 2 senile old men, I‚Äôm with Biden.
I don‚Äôt really care about the race or color. It‚Äôs got to be someone who can lead since Biden is incapable. Oh wait.....we already have a leader ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏üí™
You will also notice I follow Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren,etc. I follow various people getting various perspectives. I voted against Trump in the national election in 2016. If someone is correct on something, I will retweet it. I challenge falsehood and hypocrisy from all people.
I also see lots of Trump flags here in Wisconsin. I don‚Äôt believe Biden is leading. Trump 2020.
The point is he doesn‚Äôt. People will vote for him because they are brainwashed. They think Biden will do all these good things and he won‚Äôt. Are economy will take a big tank. And we will be worse off then we are now. Trump will pull it all back together.
It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs choice.  People need to let it go!
Any doubts Trump will win in a landslide? Read this. üëá  Mostly note the direction the numbers have shifted in just one month.
Yet the DNC refuses to nominate Sanders over Biden. Why?
Oh, I don't trust him at all. He's a blockhead. But I assume the DNC is trying to figure out how to replace Biden at this point. The decline is much more obvious now than it was at the beginning of the year.
I think that's why they've put off selecting a VP for Biden. They need to select their actual presidential candidate first.
This narrative drives me crazy, along with the idea that Biden needs to win swing states by a lot so that Trump can't contest them. A win is a win, even if WI or PA end up being extremely close
You have heard Trump‚Äôs incoherent rambling ‚Äúspeeches‚Äù correct? Biden will own him on the stage and again in November. üñïüèªüñïüèΩüñïüèø
Again skirting the subject to fit your lack of debate skills. Show me a single charge/conviction. You can't.  And a BILLIONAIRE hardly qualifies as "bad financial experience." Your boy Biden is on VIDEO touching little girls inappropriately. You conveniently omitted that FACT.
Hence if Biden is going to stick to his word and choose a woman, the only viable solution is Elizabeth Warren, but he‚Äôll manage to bungle this.
The more fumbles and bumbles around, the more evident it is that a vote for Biden is actually a vote for the VP to be President.
Absolutely. I don‚Äôt think Biden has anything to gain by debating Trump.
You‚Äôve worked harder to campaign for Biden than anyone ‚Äî you‚Äôre just too unintelligent to know it.  #TrumpGestapo #PortlandProtests  #TrumpVirusCatastrophe  #BountyGate #RacistInChief #RapistInChief #RepublicansAgainstTrump
Oh I forgot Biden has zero plans
I fully expect no senators will be picked for a Biden administration.    It will really demands on the Senate‚Äôs status after the election.
The third type are those who don‚Äôt want crooked politicians like Hillary or people with severe dementia and can‚Äôt string two sentences together like Biden running the country.
Again it‚Äôs not about supporting Biden its about being anti trump and his Administration. But again let‚Äôs remove all nuance do we can be mad at people
Would Biden be a better option on this?
Maybe Barr can open a Russia investigation on Biden. Oh wait...

Ya the MSM pumped up Hilary‚Äôs lead, shocker The polls only had her up by 2 points where it mattered. Biden is currently blowing those numbers out of the water.
The only issue with Warren is that she will be considered by most as the real President.  Joe Biden simply isn‚Äôt Presidential material.  He never really was and his cognitive abilities are clearly declining.
I doubt Joe Biden is cognizantly capable of serving a full term, so really you‚Äôre voting for his VP tbh.
He wasn‚Äôt a Biden supporter so he wasn‚Äôt really black.

Biden is obviously a clairvoyant or just understands Trump better than you!
i'm increasingly convinced that for all the criticism he gets Zuck is the last, best, hope for this country.  Its been very heartening to see him stand up to the corporate boycott demanding her serve the biden campaign (like google &amp; twitter are doing)

No one thinks he will ‚Äúthrash‚Äù Biden in the debates, not in the usual sense. Only that anyone who shares a stage with him is unavoidably sullied and made to look ridiculous.
Mr. Biden, although your apologies go a long way for some people, I, on the other hand, would like you to be more exact and clarify your statement in a more detailed manner.

See, this is why I asked if you were a Russian bot because of statements like this.   Barack is just great at the game of politics, so he has a lot of pull in the party, Biden is a party lifer and is viewed as the safe bet. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the nominee. It‚Äôs not that complicated.
Seriously doubt Biden would have done better, Obama yes and even George W I think, this is the year a 3rd party could make a real run and crickets, a fiscally conservative socially progressive hybrid, cause both sides have lost it imo, no one thinks they just pick a team and ride
Joe Biden expressed his condolences also.

My point is that nothing will fundamentally change, Biden basically rejects anything major Progressives or Social Dems want, and the biggest difference you might see is some small tax shifts.   The rest is mainly political rhetoric to get elected. Again, I don‚Äôt like the guy.
I guess I‚Äôm using the wrong terminology. Informative video, some of which I knew but definitely learned a few things. Again, I‚Äôm not for Biden and I‚Äôm all about the 2nd amendment just with some reasonable precaution.   My original point is Biden isn‚Äôt some scary socialist.
This is insane!  Do your damn work for the people Johnson!  Quit starting more conspiracy theories.
Biden and his staff should forget all those polls and consider that it's tied in all states  in other words work like hell  Clinton ran a terrible campaign last time around which is one of the reasons she lost  Biden should learn from that
You called Biden a socialist  you and Trump Commies since he loves Putin and is doing his wish list  everything Trump has done in the past five years has been to the benefit of Putin and damages this country  in other words Trump and you are traitors to this country

To believe Trump doesn't know how to debate while Biden is hiding in his basement, calling off his DNC conventions, avoiding any interviews and having his campaign warning Biden not to debate Trump really shows your level of IQ.

Trump: Biden is against the Bible, God, guns, and our kind of energy (??!) What does he mean by ‚Äúour kind of energy?‚Äù This?
Don't fall for the Okie Doke yall. This is nothing but a ploy to take votes away from Biden and ensure Trump's reelection. It's a racist tactic to think Black voters won't see through their tricks. We see you though üëÄ
WI GOP response: If Democrats weren't so afraid of actually earning votes, they wouldn't feel the need to engage in such ridiculous street theater to distract from Joe Biden's unpopularity...‚Äù
fuck joe biden. Black people aren't a monolith contrary to every statement he seems to make. democrats continually treat Black people like utter shit and expect total obedience because they're handwringing about voting yes about federal funding for cops instead of voting no.
So Biden is more of a god than God?  If that is the reasoning, then Trump should just leave or be destroyed...he he he
Who cares what she thinks! Her father would be totally disgusted with Trump &amp; he was friends with Biden
Is Biden racist? Probably. But as the last election showed us, the country is okay with electing a racist. I‚Äôm voting country over party. The lunatic in office is determined to be the last president. Republicans are going to destroy the party if they keep this up. #Biden2020
You say Biden doesn‚Äôt know God? This from the man who cheated on 3 wives, paid off strippers with whom he had affairs? The man who had to pose in front of a church holding a Bible because he has never been inside (and didn‚Äôt have permission to photograph there anyway)?
Let me be clear: Biden and his campaign are afraid to debate Trump...

Trump said of Biden, "he will take away your guns. Destroy your second amendment. No religion. No anything. Hurt The Bible. Hurt God. He's against God, He's against guns. He's against energy. Our kind of energy..." It‚Äôs alarming this works on some of y‚Äôall. #ByeDon2020
On television today Joe Biden said that aside from few exceptions, all black people think alike.
People have to remember that trump isn‚Äôt the cause of all of the problems we face today; hes the result of those problems manifesting from a restless american people. This doesn‚Äôt end when trump goes away. Biden is a republican.
Joe Biden just said all black people think the same, and it's barely trending. When you do search Biden all the results are of Trump saying Biden will hurt God. One of these things is not like the other...
Joe Biden: a) Supports the 2nd Amendment.  b) Is a gun owner.
Pretty impressive how quickly the Trump campaign went from "Biden is in mental decline" to "Biden is an all-powerful deity who can hurt God"
If Trump is what believing in God is, then I‚Äôm voting for Biden because that‚Äôs not what I believe God to be.
Clearly Trump knows that Biden is crafting a computer virus in Antifa headquarters to systematically delete all copies of the Bible that exist online. /S  Actually that wouldn't make a bad plot for a sci-fi novel someone makes a virus that deletes all copies of religous texts.
Oh please the only thing Biden could hurt if elected is millions of Americans by denying free healthcare

Always worth reminding ourselves that HRC was in a similar (if not as dominant) position four years ago.  She spent a lot of time away from the campaign trail, and ignored states that she eventually lost.  There are lessons for Biden to learn from that.
Not nearly the threat Biden is... Neither choice is great. Biden is in a galaxy all alone with the damage he'd do.

That's nothing in comparison to what Biden can't remember! The man is not fit to tie his shoes, let alone run the USA. None of these clips are edited, and Biden is a buffoon. A puppet of the globalists. Dems have a HUGE problem!

Uhhhhhh.......I don‚Äôt think after all that businesses have been through this year that anyone was hanging their hopes on a Biden speech
See this bottom of the barrel scraping dreck? This is #YellowJournalism. This controversy mongering is meant to parallel inquiries into Trump; who politicized a #Pandemic. That's should be a global #CrimeAgainstHumanity, but lets parse cognitive test thing
Again!???
VP Biden and Champ.  What a beautiful boy.
I honestly don't think Biden has the personality to worry about someone out shining him.
Biden needs to stop saying ‚Äúfolks‚Äù because it makes him sound fucking 80
That tweet makes no sense, no wonder you want Biden to have dementia so he can be like you!
Bingo. It's nothing more than hypocrisy. Mr Biden has gone out of way and said he wanted a woman for his VP because he knows alot of them are just as deserving,  qualified if not more so of the position than a man,  yet she still found a reason to complain is unbelievable üòí
They‚Äôre gonna replace Biden with Clinton or Warren and I bet it was the plan the whole time.
Biden could be in a coma and he‚Äôd be a better prez than trumpy
Not a fan of Biden, but if you think Trump is not desperate right now, I don't know what to tell you.
Nonstop accolades for Arizona/Doucey, why? Biden is polling ahead. Trump is unilaterally sending $18 billion to his ‚Äúred‚Äù state friend. Whether you‚Äôre a repbub, dem, Independent...just a US citizens this man should make you uncomfortable! Trump is the prez of red states only.ü§¨
He figured since he's been in his basement for months he might as well do a little tidying up down there while his delusional wife who is so desperate to become FLOTUS is upstairs picking out inaugural day dresses. By the way Biden couldn't run a Jimmy Johns for an afternoon.
Kinda of a bummer for #mke Stay strong Milwaukee!
Yup. Rush called him Plugs Biden for years.
With Joe Biden not speaking in Milwaukee, the DNC will now be completely virtual. The effect it will have on the city. Join  &amp;  on  at 6:00.
Why are Dems so worried about Kanye? If Biden is the best candidates to help African Americans, they‚Äôll vote for him, right?
I'm voting Green, I want to throw my dirty work boots at Biden. I can't vote for dude.
i‚Äôm confused on why the GOP chairman would make this claim ‚Äî it‚Äôs based in fact (he‚Äôs opted out of the convention) but it‚Äôs written in a way such that the solution (‚Äúdems learn from their mistakes‚Äù) would mean Biden does visit... and wouldn‚Äôt that be bad for the state GOP?
Sad for Milwaukee, but the right thing to keep Biden safe.
Biden and Trump CAN'T be the best we can do, America. I refuse to believe THESE are the Champions of Whiteness.  Please, explain this shit.
NONE of this is edited. Biden is not ok. Biden has dementia or Alzheimer's. It's obvious to anyone who is watching him, that's why his handlers are keeping him locked up. Please stop. Trump doesn't need to photoshop anything!
I totally agree! Biden has nothing to gain by debating... and everyone who is voting already knows where these two candidates stand on issues!   We need to get something big out of this, like his taxes!
Noone needs to look far for clips of Biden completely out of it! He's not praying.
Not 1 of these clips are doctored! Trump doesn't need to look very far for Biden fumbling, mumbling, and looking as though he hasn't a clue of what's going on, HE DOESN'T!
Just a reason not to vote for Biden. We'll protest him just like Trump.
Democrats are really going ALL OUT! Religious bigotry? Trump is religious, Biden isn't as religious as Trump, and the Democrats in general hate Christians, want to close churches, the lying media and leftists who are this ignorant...#pathetic!
I might have to. I can‚Äôt get any worse then Biden/trump
You should apologize for it giving the impression that Biden isn‚Äôt.
The news they were dreading: Biden-less DNC is the final heartbreaker‚Äã
Walker is talking out of his ass again about  Biden being smart and staying home from the convention, but don't forget how he was last year when they first announced the convention was coming here:
You got it, the Bernie bros will latch onto him because they see Ye as a hybrid to Bernie and 45. They don't want to vote for trump because of who he is but they don't support Biden because he isn't cool enough like Kanye or progressive enough like Bernie. So it's a compromise
I don‚Äôt know, but if you have evidence then share it with the relevant authorities.
is a tool being used by the Democrat party to try to get someone else into the office after he is deemed incompetent. We the people are not really voting for Joe Biden, but whoever his VP selection will be. As for me and my family, MAGA TRUMP 2020!

Trump's nomination will be virtual as well.   Every talking point against Biden usually gets trumped by Trump.  We don't want large crowds in Milwaukee.  He is doing what his voters think is right.  I don't need a stage performance to keep me interested in voting.

No surprise that ‚Å¶ is disappointed about an all virtual convention, but keep your eye on the fact that Milwaukee needs federal reimbursement to come through for its security costs. Not getting funds could be huge issue for city.
If Bernie shows at the convention in Milwaukee and Biden stays at home in his onesie, Bernie should become the nominee no questions asked.
‚ÄúIn my mind this is a 100 percent virtual convention,‚Äù said Mayor Barrett
Except she didn‚Äôt, and it wasn‚Äôt, and she didn‚Äôt. Read the Mueller report and all the IG reports. Sally Yates is as squeaky clean as it gets &amp; hopefully, she will have a prominent place in the Biden administration.

People voted for Jill Stein because they *hated* the very competent email lady. I think Kanye will pull more disaffected Trump voters than Biden voters.

Alderman Michael Murphy told  he's upset that former Vice President   will not be coming to Milwaukee for the DNC and thinks it's a bad decision for Biden to make.   Full Interview:
Apparently they don't want Biden to do any debates. They are afraid he'll say something really stupid or something.
Kanye West is being used to take votes away from Biden. He knows he doesn't have a chance in hell to win. He is A run away train in his mind. Don't give him your vote. #Biden2020Landslide
"There Biden goes again, believing in fairy tales like public health and science. You don't ever have to worry about Donald Trump believing in that stuff! He will never do what's best for you or emphasize the public good."
This decision is a political strategic error. WI is a key state for the US elections and Biden can safely be in Milwaukee. Did democrats learn anything from last elections? Or do they think that only the coranavirus will win the election for Biden?
The same rationale that Biden is using to justify not coming to Milwaukee for the Convention would apply equally to the debates. If Biden decides he has nothing to gain, don't be surprised if he pulls out of those too.

Biden Won't Travel To Milwaukee To Accept Democratic Nomination
It's so much more than that. But so be it. I sincerely hope that I'm wrong about Biden and that he does do a complete 180 from his past. I prefer to not only slow the damage but to actually make things better.
Trump Victory Spokewoman on Joe Biden not speaking at DNC in Milwaukee:  ‚ÄúJoe Biden is repeating the mistakes from the 2016 campaign. The fact remains that President Donald Trump has delivered on his promises to Wisconsin voters and he will carry the state again in November.‚Äù
Trump campaign responds to DNC: ‚ÄúJoe Biden has formally abandoned Wisconsin.‚Äù
That's why I'm so frustrated by the #NeverTrump rhetoric. In the 8yrs of the Obama administration, the only big accomplishment was ACA. Now suddenly decades of systemic racism is all Trump's fault, and will be magically fixed by electing Biden.
I would be willing to bet Biden knows the proper pronunciation of Yosemite.

NY Times: Biden won't visit Milwaukee for an almost entirely virtual DNC
UW-Madison political scientist Byron Shafer has one-word reaction: "Wow."
Listen up, Trump Administration is trying to play the 2016 play book. Senate are holding a hearing on the Flinn investigated. They are trying to throw Biden, Susan Rice and president Obama out there to be the back apples. Don't fall for it. Barr will announce
Honestly, after hearing 1M times that "Hillary didn't even visit Wisconsin", I'd have thought Dems would wrap Biden in Saran Wrap, borrow the Pope Mobile and drive him up and down Wisconsin Ave.  I'm honestly puzzled..we're asking a lot of questions today....hope to get answers.
They want to claim that Biden doesn't need a VP, that it's racist, that things need to "change". Trust me, the Democrats are communists, and communists use puppets as a tool to distract, and Biden is just a distraction. He wouldn't be making decisions for this county!
Not great to see  taking the Clinton 2016 approach to Wisconsin.
That is because Biden is holding up the debates, and running from the President and the people's. Its not our fault that 'They know not what they do' thus said the Lord Jesus Christ!
The  says Biden will accept the nomination remotely and the DNC in Milwaukee will be almost entirely virtual:
Biden and all other scheduled speakers no longer coming to Milwaukee, which seems to all but officially cancel what once was the DNC in Milwaukee.
Biden as a bumbling, brain rotted president would be very funny to watch. And obviously everything would still suck if he wins.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think America is going to pick up Joe Biden‚Äôs pilot for a full term. Instead the networks will green light Trump for season 2.

The presumptive Democratic nominee for President says he will not be coming to Milwaukee, the host city of the Democratic National Convention, for his acceptance speech, according to a report.
True that. Reflecting on our values as Catholics as the pope has said and voting accordingly. I think trump is just wacked up because Biden is an observant Catholic.
Don't forget about all the people need federal funding so don't make this a black issue. It's a country issue because there's many people white and other mixtures that is going to vote for Biden. Donald Trump is hanging himself by only caring for the rich during a pandemic.
They are exactly shitty enough people to think that the black population in Milwaukee will vote for Kanye just because it‚Äôs Kanye and that this will take votes away from Biden.  That‚Äôs the GOP plan for black voters. It‚Äôs so insanely insulting.
Biden supporter living in MKE, here, and I‚Äôm glad to hear this. There are reports of some local police departments refusing to send police to protect people at the convention. And there are police departments in the state refusing to enforce the mask mandate. Keep him healthy!!
So far, people have been hearing plenty from Biden, and we know his  pretty simple, he‚Äôs just hanging back and letting the Dotard lose on his own every time he opens his mouth. What‚Äôs to discuss?Just let Donny destroy his own campaign,lying &amp; misinforming
Final election 2020 prediction:  If  dies before November 3rd 2020 he wins the popular vote but still loses the electoral college.   If Joe Biden is alive on November 3rd 2020 then he loses the popular vote and the electoral college.
Hopefully Joe Biden can save us from the mess he created.

Their endgame is to give his VP a shot at 10 years in the White House.   They‚Äôre committing elder abuse to do it.   I don‚Äôt care for Biden‚Äôs politics. At all. Not a fan of his behavior, either. But he‚Äôs an old man in clear cognitive decline and it makes me sick to watch this.
Are we to believe that Biden wouldn't be out trumpeting his successful test, were here capable of passing one? C'mon man. That's like thinking he's an elephant, when he's a lion.
Trump can easily make Biden and Dems say they disagree with an immigration policy that prioritizes immigrant doctors fighting COVID-19. Imagine how popular such a policy would be. Instead, national anthem tweets. Fml

Unlike head massa Joe Biden  #Ye2020 #Kanye2020 #KanyeWest2020Your ignorant, divisive tweets aimed at rallying your ‚Äúbase‚Äù make me sick and galvanize my vote for Joe Biden this fall. Keep on tweeting things like ChinaVirus because it‚Äôs driving people like me (and there are many of us) who have voted Republican for many years, away.
Several sources say Biden will wait until November 2nd to tell us who he's chosen.
I can't say how much I agree with this.  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  He is far from my favorite and primary his ass out in 2024 but voting for him is a vote to start fixing this dumb shit.
IMHO not necessarily bad to ‚Äúrush‚Äù innovation, but science requires time. Speaking with friends, Nov/Dec 2020 simply isn‚Äôt enough time.  I will trust a Biden administration and Fauci. This of course moves any vaccine into February 2021 at the earliest.....

How many porn stars did Biden pay off?
F this noise. Isn't it enough that voters all but capitulated and gave them Biden, when we could have had Warren or Sanders - actual progressives.  Now they want to hold the VP pick hostage? If they aren't ready to vote against Trump by now they never were going to.
Oh the left is letting him know how little appeal, support, or trust they have in Biden.
Hi Thom, Why does it seem like Biden is dragging out the VP pick? Maybe it always takes this long but all the speculation and waiting has become a bit annoying.
Horror thought...  If Biden drops out before accepting the nomination (or even before the election), do we get Bernie by default? üò±
When I work at Walmart, I see people wearing Trump hats and masks.  I haven't seen any Biden hats or masks, here.
He's following the rules to stay healthy and avoid getting COVID-19. There is not a single voter whose support for Biden over Trump was pinned to seeing him in Milwaukee.
People have criticized Trumps bluster, but he's a comedian.  He's basically an Orange Aziz Ansari.  He complains more than anything else.  Biden actually insults people to their faces and would probably be in 5 fights a day if he wasn't famous.  Trump is a moderate.
So: 1) Lie about Biden‚Äôs health, mental acumen 2) Get a mentally ill Star to play spoiler in key states 3) Present 33.4% drop in GDP as good 4) Say‚Äùoh well‚Äùabout 160K preventable deaths 5) Ignore Russian bounties  Finally Trumps 2020 campaign platform in a nutshell. Some restart!
I think the logic is there‚Äôs a certain percentage of people that absolutely will not vote for Trump and probably won‚Äôt vote for Jorgensen so giving them an option that still isn‚Äôt Biden helps Trump more than it hurts him
No but Trump has his base that would justify him burning an American flag at this point and the more people running that aren‚Äôt Biden helps Trump

Sad so many democrats are wanting a black man banned from running for President. But the democrat party started the KKK, and fought to keep slavery in the civil war, and Biden fought in Congress to keep segregation. So I guess it makes sense.
Biden wouldn‚Äôt remember if he was here or not. Someone should just tell him he was in Wisconsin. Make the old guy happy!
Now we know what Joe Biden really thinks of Wisconsin. He‚Äôs refusing to visit WISCONSIN. Guess he thinks he doesn‚Äôt need Wisconsin voters.
Honestly, at this point - because of COVID - you have to wonder if Biden too will not visit Wisconsin during his presidential campaign.
Gonna be fascinating to find out which of the other Biden Veep choices is dropping this oppo on Karen Bass. Trump's folks or the RNC would be stupid to be dropping this now.

What people don't get about ambition is this motivation. Being driven is a great thing. I love where I grew up (Hartford, CT), but I was taught from early on to improve my lot in life and never stop trying. Biden's crew were born with that privilege. Their lives wouldn't change.
There are people on this here app, lamenting Biden criticism. He was no one's first choice.
I find it odd that people are more upset with truthful Biden criticism than coded misogynoir aimed at Kamala Harris. A qualified Black woman is being dragged and some people are worried about Biden's feelings.  SMH

Lol...this racist idiot basically just said that all Black People are the same. What a dunce.     Really, Joe? Get out and meet some black people, and you'll quickly find that what is true of all races is true of them. THEY ARE INDIVIDUALS!!!!!

Unfortunately it's not up to him or anyone else in Congress, the executive branch is the one that has to initiate and sustain prosecutions. Biden's boss refused to do so in 2008, and I see no reason to think Biden will change course in 2020.
In a COVID-19 world, the DNC has scaled back several times- from changing dates, trimming down the hours, to now going remote. Delegates will cast ballots virtually, watching Joe Biden accept his nomination from home.
I‚Äôve been saying the same thing.  A Biden administration will literally be restoring our nation.  Restoring relationships with allies, working across the aisle, and on and on.  He IS the only guy that can do this.  I‚Äôve always believed that.
You're talking with leftists. It's clear now they are 100% hypocrite. One set of rules for thee, a completely difference set for me and my friends. They'll convict Trump on accusation alone, but demand the entire court proceeding/conviction docs for Biden, despite video evidence!
Biden would have a chance to cement himself as the FDR of this century but the whole premise of his run in the primary was to PREVENT another FDR. Biden is going to govern in an austerity model with predictably poor favorability numbers, IMO.
Trump has this baggage, too. But here's the difference, kid. Trump's foibles have been THOROUGHLY vetted at this point, because the press hates him and will seize on ANYTHING they can to damage him. They've NEVER asked Biden these tough questions. That's the difference.
Trump‚Äôs allies are putting Kayne West on the Wisconsin ballot to draw Black voters away from Biden in a political dirty trick
I don't think this will directly hurt Biden. I think most of the people who would vote for Kanye would be people who have never voted before. However if he brings out new voters in the middle of a pandemic, what will that do to poll capacity, especially in places like MKE?
It's infuriating, unethical, but also incredibly hilarious that basically every individual frame of Trump's "Biden hiding alone" ad is a photoshopped picture of him at some sort of gathering.

It makes sense to GOP senators who expect Trump to lose, want to hamstring economic recovery under Biden, &amp; position themselves for 2024.  From 2008-2010, we learned it is expensive to undershoot fiscal in a deep recession.  GOP learned it helps their campaigns.

Depends on if Trump is reelected. I think with a Biden presidency, people will grow discontented with his centrist inaction, and the progressive wing of the dems is already growing and can make a fuss. If it's Trump again, though, we have no choice but to revolt
What is your point? Everyone knows you're required to mask up when entering enclosed public spaces. The anti mask argument only shows ignorance and selfishness. This stance only helps the Biden electorate.

I'd still vote for Biden over trump.....
As Biden nears his VP pick, it's worth revisiting a statement one candidate made in 2019. Sure they all qualify, with strengths, but if the most qualified for VP loses, it would be due to what she said at a time Biden was desperate to revive his campaign.
I'm betting on it #45.  Everyone get out &amp; vote!  So There will be no question Biden will be the winner!  Run #45 &amp; Putin out of town.

Come on, the republican party nominated a joke for president. Biden's allowed to joke once in a while too.

I would hope Biden is up 14 in WI with party affiliation at 39% to 29% Dems
13 weeks from today, Biden WILL win by the biggest landslide ever.
The guy down the road from me at any time has at least two tRump flags flying, a few yard signs, and a cardboard cutout flipping the finger. But I‚Äôve also started seeing Biden and even a ‚ÄúANYONE BUT TRUMP 2020‚Äù signs.
I hope that whoever moderates the debates will make full use of web-based tech features such as mute and requiring the participants to wait their turn to speak.   Simply disallowing Trump from talking over Biden will crush him and show him for the idiot that he is.
Important piece. Looking forward to seeing what a Biden administration will do to repair and strengthen transatlantic relations.
Tensions flare as GOP's Biden probe ramps up. via
Lol the Dems can‚Äôt com up with any other reason to vote for Biden?  Really? No policies like M4A, legalizing weed, 15/hr minimum wage, anything!?  If ‚ÄúNot Trump‚Äù is all they have, the election is already lost.
I hate him so much, he looks like such a loser here. All of you better vote for Joe Biden!!!!!!
Type nerd alert. Good typography always wins.
VOTE JOE BIDEN and save America.
The only way trump can win is through lies and cheating. Biden was kneeling to talk to a child. But you knew that and still don‚Äôt care. Just like your disgusting father. Whatever it takes to get what you want. Lying, cheating, unethical means, corruption. Doesn‚Äôt matter.

Yet even with 10 tweets there is not one that says to vote for Biden, only to vote.  Maybe you should tell your cult to vote for Biden because any other type is a vote dor Trump.  That would be too hard for you though.
I was thinking the same thing.  1 debate every 2 weeks until the election.  Invite Kayne to the unscheduled debates.  If Biden doesn't show up they'll just bash Biden the whole time.  It will force Biden to debate.   Show on OAN or Newsmax.  Everyone will watch.
The responses to this thread are just Bernie Bros mad at Bernie and refusing to vote for Biden lmao
A Warren campaigner in Wisconsin voting for Biden- because Trump must go!  #womenagainstTrump
I am not a Trump fan, but you are way off here.  I am not sure Biden has the cognitive faculties to be president anymore.  Honestly him and Bernie scare the üí©out of me.  We have to pick between a Turd sandwich and a giant douche.
One of those sycophants who just lavishes praise on Trump at every turn. I just want to see him coddled and praised and told he's done everything right. Then Joe Biden says, "America has room for everyone, even someone like you." They tearfully hug and the building is detonated.

Right now we do. But failing that, we can look out for ourselves and our own security if needs be. Can't be said for so many in the world who have been so oppressed by Communist degeneracy for so long. Vote for Biden = North Korea, Kampuchea, Cuba, China, Venezuela in our future!

Evers endorses Biden, pledges to do ‚Äòeverything I can do to help elect him‚Äô
Yeah....pretty sure that would do NOTHING for Trump. He cant instill his misogynistic creepy stalker thing to Biden like he did with Hilary. His base ate that shit up. And I'm guessing that Joe would be much more proactive in calling him out on his bullshit on stage.
He's just getting around to this?  What's the hold up??? What changed today?

It was just an article.  Never said she was a favorite of mine.  I can tell you this though-They ALL have downsides.  EVERY SINGLE 1! I trust Biden to pick whoever he wants-period.  I refuse to trash ANY of them.  But again-Twitter seems to think they know more than anyone else.

coronavirus cases continue to rise in many parts of the country, and millions have fears of losing their healthcare. The challenges our country faces demand a president ...  but who will lead us with kindness, respect, and compassion. That leader is Joe Biden.
Yes, and Brad Johnson. But Biden has been a better politician over a long career. They were good game managers with one successful year.

Dude, Trump has said on the Record that he has never asked God for forgiveness......Biden is a devout Catholic.  Yet you never question  ....wonder why?
True, but Joe Biden would still wipe the floor with tRump.
Terrific question. I suspect she'd also be ahead of Trump but a notch behind where Biden is. Biden may get a small bonus for being a familiar figure, a source of stability from the recent past, &amp; male.

JUST IN: Gov. Tony Evers has endorsed Joe Biden for president.
I don't think there should be debates.  That said, the cult has been blowing the "Joe has dementia" trumpet so loud, they have set the bar incredibly low for Biden's performance.
You are probably right about Dems wanting to save the Senate seat in OH (&amp; WI). Interesting to consider how Klobuchar's list woulda diverged from Biden's by adding men (e.g, Booker, O'Rourke) or steering away from Obama admin types (e.g. Rice).please make sure President Biden has a Coronavirus plan ready to go day one!
I sure hope President Biden has one ready to go!
They hope he‚Äôll get some Black votes that Biden would get by default otherwise
Yep, I laughed out loud when I heard him! He didn't skip a beat. I still chuckle thinking about it

Funny Rob. We will wait until the debates....I think Biden is going to get eaten up. Biden doesn't know what city he is in or who is interviewing him on most days. Surely you can handle criticism of Biden.
So Biden has a 7.8 point lead? Smh
That right wingers are loudly belching about how Biden not physically attending an ENTIRELY VIRTUAL convention proves that he is ‚Äútoo old‚Äù just goes to show that they legit have no other evidence of that point.   If avoiding pandemics make someone old, all smart people are old.
Im surprised you haven‚Äôt been pumping the Jo vote. Unlike the last election when all of the Bernie voters hated Hilary, no one really hates Biden. If West was serious, he would drop out and get all of his ducks in a row for 2024
Right.... but he was also conservative for 3 of these last 4 years. He isn‚Äôt taking votes just from Biden

I am turning 18 next month, and that means, I will be old enough to vote, and the person I am voting for, is Joe Biden. Please do not ruin America, I was born in America.
And another thing...your father has cold, dead eyes, indicating a serious issue with his personality.  Joe Biden, on the other hand, radiates empathy and compassion. His eyes are not empty, cold sockets like your father's.   This is why B is my answer.
I bet he still votes for Biden
I want what your smoking.  Biden has to be reminded to put his underwear on in the morning.  He's scared to talk to anyone unless its scripted.  People will be licking their chops for a chance to bend him over a barrel.  WTF is his Corona strategy?  Wear a Mask and Hide?
Yep neither Does Joe Biden...
I agree with you, Alyssa. I have my clear favorite, and yes, I will be disappointed if she isn't chosen....but I will be far more disappointed if Biden does not win the election.
I am anxiously awaiting Biden's vp pick...hoping it is Elizabeth Warren, who I feel is unmatched. If it isn't Warren, I will be disappointed...while also knowing that every single choice is a good one, and will finally give a woman the shot to do better than those before her.

EXTREMELY BIDEN 2020. Pitch perfect for Dems too.
No she won't.  Americans don't like her, the African American community does not like her, even Biden doesn't like her.   She can only run on her lies for so long.
The fact that republicans like Kamala Harris even more than they like Joe Biden is quite worrisome
Is it Coma, or Camilla or Kamala? Biden just pronounced her name 3 or 4 different ways.  Does he know her name?
Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump‚Äôs fault.
Once a liar always a liar....lookout here comes Biden/Harris

Also, I love how I got to listen to someone close to me call someone online a fa***t, but yet I'M the problematic one for not living Kamala Harris and Biden, neither of whom have done nothing wrong ever.
Make no mistake. Harris was choosen months ago. Her delayed announcement was to keep a dementia riddled Biden out of the lime light. He will be a complete puppet of the DNC. He will push their national agenda to disarm POC to &amp; continue buying elections for the DNC on the basis,

Say what? China would prefer Biden? Of course they would, Biden up China‚Äôs ass for decades. BIGGER QUESTION??  WHO THE FUCK IS CHOMPER TALKING TO IN CHINA? AND WHY. PELOSI WORKING WITH CHINA TO CHEAT ON ELECTION? SHE‚ÄôLL STOP AT NOTHING TO GET HERSELF INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
But Biden was in charge and he was wonderful. Ask him. But he doesn‚Äôt remember. How can he brag about horrendous failure. Because that‚Äôs the democrat way.
Obama Biden Schiff Schumer Nadler Pelosi Clinton‚Äôs many many more. Lock them all up. All guilty as hell. TREASON covers most I believe. Penalty for TREASON??  Used to be death didn‚Äôt it? Attempting a coup on a duly elected President. Planning even before election. FBI spying.
Kanye ... Are you trying to help Trump get re-elected... Stop this stupidity. There are not enough people willing to put you in office... All you will succeed in doing is taking votes away from Biden and putting Trump back in office.#KanyeWest
Noticed GOP hasn't pushed Tara Reade story to damage Biden. Why not?  Despite Blasey-Ford, Kavanaugh is on the bench. Despite numerous rape accusations, Trump is in the white house.  Is there a gray area I missed, here. Was Reade's allegation dropped due to lack of evidence?
What is the game plan if you‚Äôre not voting for Biden? Like I get having the moral high ground is nice and all, but what is the second option here?
Biden‚Äôs attempt to pander to everyone is a sure case of self destruction if you ask me. Now he‚Äôs going after the diehard democrats who he needs to get any votes. He‚Äôs estranged every other group of American people there is.
He‚Äôs headed for the ditch on the wrong side of the road. So he can get his pic took. In a dumb fuckin face mask. And there are actually people who would elect him? For anything? Ok then. I will vote for Biden to be hall monitor at nursing home.
He‚Äôs the best of the best democrat. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all the have. And from an outsider looking in at the Democratic Party, they‚Äôre probably right. They have nobody nothing else, anywhere.The likes of Nadler Pelosi Schumer Biden and many others have made sure of that. THEY STINK
1) Are you sure you don't stand with Russia? You do like to take trips there on the 4th of July.  And a pro-Russian Ukrainian parliamentarian is using you to spread misinformation about former Vice President Biden. This pro-Russian actor is attempting to undermine U.S. elections.
The more and more I see that Fox video the funnier it gets to me. That‚Äôs the best Biden has looked all campaign!

Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Voting for someone with dimentia is not a wise choice. You will stop at nothing just to try and win. Biden MUST DEBATE him before any early votes go out mail in voting is for those of us not able to stand in line &amp; Americans serving this country  Sept 1st debate or sooner
People pointing out that Biden's lead at this point in the race is similar to Clinton's lead need to remember that at this point in 2016, Clinton was at the peak of her convention bump.
538 has the Biden margin at 7.6. Still down two points from early July, but RCP is just more prone to fluctuations.
Joe Biden you need to be in a rest home you need to be treated for dementia or some thing your mind is not right. And for those of you that are allowing this to go on it is disgusting quit using with this poor man‚Äôs life
I declare the winner of the 2020 presidential election to be DONALD J TRUMP.There I got that covered.Could you imagine Pelosi or Biden or any democrat alive today being president??  It would mean total annihilation of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. But Pelosi‚Äôs soul sold to Satan
That‚Äôs the plan when Biden wins.
Clever. The Biden campaign generated a "Biden's competing in Texas!" news cycle by making a tiny ad buy, while continuing to pour cash into the truly pivotal states.
"My vote for Biden hinges on his veep pick" is a view that is essentially confined to op-ed columnists.üôèüèæüôèüèºüôèüèΩ Meet Major. The Biden‚Äôs rescue.
This is how intelligent and coherent I imagine every Trump and Biden interview.
I don't think they are going to need to steal it. Biden has Alzheimer's &amp; even the progressive left doesn't like Harris. USPS failings are because of COVID, and the fact they have less business now than in 1985. Maybe you should get your facts before you make stupid comments.
No questions for #SenileJoeBiden! No questions at all, as Trump takes them daily, plummeted by them, about everything. Biden can't answer unscripted questions. If you vote for Biden, you are voting for Harris, the most fake politician in history as President. No way!
I think I'll buy a joe Biden hat!
I'm from Wisconsin but I can't vote for Biden. I'm voting Green.
Harris def. did some of that, and Biden definitely did a LOT more.  "Not Trump" is...something, but IF they win, THEN what do we have? No one who stands for much of anything pro-people at all.  What kind of democracy is it where candidates offer nothing yet auto-expect our votes?

Joe "Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" Biden doesn't have my trust.
It does matter. I just don't think Biden and Harris truly care. Harris's past and Biden picking her is proof of that.
Durham strikes, first guilty plea....  Odds of Biden actually being on ticket for November election
The election is already over Biden Harris Landslide is all we‚Äôre gonna see. It‚Äôll be a big blue wave and the new Leaders will save us all with totalitarian communism !!!
I mean, standing up for what is right and fair for all is what matters.   If enough of us did that, we'd never have another Trump or Biden or Clinton or Obama or Bush again.
Your boy biden dodges All questions.
Biden Harris already won no need to even bother it‚Äôs gonna be a landslide. Blumph is finished this time for sure !!!
Um, I thought Biden would pick Hillary for VP, what?
Probably smarter than what I thought: Biden picking H for VP nominee...
The union said Thursday that President Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office.
did she give a speech tonight or something? or is this in response to Biden and her announcement speech?
People want Biden to win so they can go back to being ignorant about our destruction.
...but I'm going to stay home on election day, because Kamala is a cop and Biden's healthcare plan isn't quite progressive enough.
I've given my blind support to them without any ? Now I can see that they simply look out for their own interests as per this continued "stimulus" and raising taxes on small businesses &amp; middle class Americans. I supported Bernie. I can't with Biden &amp; Harris!

I'm not loyal to Biden, and I understand why you wouldn't vote for him, but I fear what may happen if Trump gets another 4 years.
82 more days of this. A narcissist lives for this kind of fight. He will be hyper focused morning, noon and night. We‚Äôll see more promising of $ to anyone/everyone, nonstop attacks on Biden/Harris, unrealistic expectations of supporters, spiraling, anger...this will not go well.
the media is losing their SHIT abt being able to fetishize obama and biden again and frankly im SICK! of it
There is truth to what you say, and if Biden were running against a Mccain or a Romney, I'd probably vote 3rd party, but Trump is crazy unhinged.
Sure, but to conflate the two is just...I don't even know. I am NOT a fan of Biden, but Trump is an enabler of extremism.  He needs to go.

No, Joe Biden can't ban voucher schools in Wisconsin

Biden opposes vouchers, but experts say the president wouldn't have the authority to halt a program authorized and funded by the state.

Un, didn't Sunrise Movement just endorse Biden. Me soooo confuseded!
Biden 2020 right there!! Lol
My guess is an anarchist that supports Biden this election to kick out Trump
2020 Pres Candidates as NFL QBs   Biden: Ryan Fitzpatrick. Old White placeholder who hasn‚Äôt done much in terms of success  Harris: Tua Tagovailoa. Young potential non-white  ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù in waiting  Trump: Roethlisberger. Repulsive, rapey, but has a few W‚Äôs.   Pence: Jake Fromm
No, Joe Biden can't ban school choice vouchers in Wisconsin (though he's strongly against them). We rate this claim False, after a quick stopover to examine the pseudo-news site spreading this claim.
Certainly seems like Biden will likely lose
Biden and Heels Up Harris can kiss my a**! Both cheeks.
Haha, when will the "press" ask Biden a question...about Antifa...or anything??? That is a good one!!
Biden, to a screaming Jim Boylen just offstage: "Listen bald . . ."
I would not be surprised if the Biden Harris group said you two ask a question, we won't reply but it will show the "press" is asking ???'s. #suchafarce
It's remarkable, and  just nodded and gleefully invited the nitwit back.  I mean, really. What possibly could a voter "learn" about Biden now and actually say, "Yeah, Trump has flaws, but NOTHING like that!" ????  Do better, CNN.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
Trump will defeat Biden and the Usurper with ease.
I‚Äôm guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!
So this "chicken or shit&amp;glass" analogy is the newest way libs are dismissing criticisms of Biden as ludicrously petty.  But it ignores that badly cooked chicken can kill you &amp; it ignores what critics are actually saying - the chicken is stuffed w/ shit&amp; glass.

Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris - CNN  via
Your role in this is to vote &amp; to engage others--not the Trumpsters who are too far gone but all the people who think Kamala isn't sufficiently progressive or Biden isn't Bernie or voting is a hassle. Stop trying to win over Trump fans &amp; start working on the passive &amp; undecided.
The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phone
Trans people aren‚Äôt allowed to point out she was f*cking TRANSPHOBIC? (I‚Äôm obvi still voting biden, I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs ignorant and entitled to say that trans people don‚Äôt have VALID CRITICISM for Kamala)
Growing weaker and weaker...like when your wife was dying and you divorced her because you couldn‚Äôt honor your marriage vows, cheating on her and abandoning her? That‚Äôs what this tweet brings to mind.  Biden is fine and will be fine, and Harris will be a great support.
Former Clinton White House spokesman Robert Weiner tells  &amp;  that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris need to visit Wisconsin after next weeks DNC.
'Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, similarly said during another radio interview this week that the evidence his committee had uncovered was so "outrageous" that "it should completely disqualify Biden from president."'

I've had the same thought.  Obviously they are pointed at Trump, but Biden doesn't exactly come across as functioning either.
My town is filled with yard signs that say "Any Functioning Adult 2020." I tend to think that is those people. Although it's debatable whether Biden is still a functioning adult lol.
I worry that now the Biden-Sanders working groups have done their work and Harris has been chosen, Biden advisors feel they have "sewn up" their bases of support and will now pivot to the Wall Street centrists.
The Trump campaign officially releases details of President Donald Trump's trip to Oshkosh on Monday.  He'll be speaking about "Joe Biden‚Äôs failures on Jobs and the Economy" at an airport hangar.

Clearly not. Fair elections, without interference and accepting the results are the foundation of this country. Everything else is built on that. Assuming Biden wins this needs his attention on day 1.
Her and Biden are just as bad. There‚Äôs years and years of evidence just look at both sides corruption and then vote gold
For days, all I've heard is Harris will beat up Pence. Yawn. Two corporate stooges arguing whose corporate masters are better doesn't interest me.   But no one is talking about the Biden-Trump debates. I wonder why. That's going to be hilarious!!
Issue with both Trump and Biden I meant.
I think this is a compound problem of being both an issue with and an issue with Biden.  I think Biden needs to keep getting his messaging out strong about what he's going to do to help American's Healthcare system.
The thing that chaps my ass the most is when they say a third party vote is a vote for Trump to try and guilt me into going along with Biden.
Girl-make up your mind.   Trump isn't a republican like your father is.  He is a nazi wanna be. I suggest in honor of your Dad, sidestep the assohole and support Biden/Harris for a change.  Do you want your child growing up in Nazi era??? Your choice!
I have read multiple pieces on how the election will be stolen. Honestly it's mindblowing what I think we will be in for IF the election goes to Biden. The thing that infuriates me is that supporters will see nothing wrong with it and be like "OMG get over it"
Listen I get that Biden and Harris are not good on pro-life policies, but Trump isn‚Äôt either. Pro-life means being pro-life from conception until natural death. Trump is not that

There‚Äôs a part of me that believes Biden won‚Äôt make it out of August.  I could really see him except a nomination and then around Labor Day step down.
I wish, it's clear that Biden was always going to be the presidential nominee. Everything else was just "performance art" and Bernie's futile trying.  I have to say, Markey might have actually been a stronger candidate than Bernie based on this ad, though.

All Biden or  has to do to win this election is make an add like "Are you mad that football is cancelled? Blame President Trump! His failure to protect the country from the Corona Virus has cancelled football &amp; killed 170,000 Americans"

I wanted to play an online game and there was a Joe Biden commercial first on a game site. He ain't messing around
For example, broadly speaking I view Biden v Trump as:  -Getting better‚ùå -Not getting worse‚ùå -Getting worse (Biden) -Getting far worse (Trump)  That‚Äôs not to say I discourage voting Biden, I just think it‚Äôs necessary to be brazenly honest about him &amp; his prospective presidency.
Hard agree. If someone is hung up on a Biden/Harris ticket, they haven‚Äôt been paying attention these past four years. This election is deadly serious. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say he‚Äôs destroying everything he touches.
Agreed, I just contend that when discussing candidates/policies, it‚Äôs imperative that we distinguish (A) ways Biden/Dems = less bad than Trump/GOP (‚Äúnot getting worse‚Äù) FROM (B) ways Biden/Dems/progressives will actually [materially] improve upon the status quo (‚Äúgetting better‚Äù)
Yes. Joe Biden supporters are corny weirdos that worship CNN.
I dislike the Clintons more than either Harris or Biden, and Harris IS better than Tim Kaine
Rather this cult then jumping on Biden‚Äôs lap. And making the hairs on his leg stand up.
I'm pretty sure  would poll at over 20% within a week of debating Biden and Trump. Her plan on criminal justice reform alone makes Biden's look like nothing more than an attempt to grab votes with no real change (oh wait, that's exactly what it is)
So yeah, Biden/Harris may not be the candidates I'm in love with, but I know who don't like, and I'll be using my vote to vote against Trump, who I believe is bringing the US closer to fascism every day.
I mean, the Biden/Harris administration will probably appoint people who are *not* actively out to destroy portions of the government, including the EPA, Dept of Education, CDC, USPS, etc...
Which brings me to Biden/Harris... people are bitching about them already, but like... They may not be your first choice, but I guarantee they are better than Trump and better than a flaming bag of dog shit...

The Unity Platform and Harris' record are encouraging.   Potentially incredible platform ideas-will the DNC adopt them?  Or will Biden's advisors push him to the  Kasich-Bloomberg-Wall Street friendly center?  Division can happen two ways.
I'm confused. Are you not voting for Biden?
how about you use your outrage at third party voters every four years and help us actually get candidates that represent us. I blame YALL for voting Biden in the damn primaries you idiotsIt sounds like you‚Äôve had Biden on ‚Äútop secret probation‚Äù. Benghazi all over again.  Six years of investigation resulting in nothing.  Republican credibility is in the toilet and will be for years. Keep kissing Trumps ass you‚Äôll go far.
Some ass signed me up for every Biden email in existence
You know Obama and Biden have done that too...
So Obama blamed all issues on Bush and claims all of Trump's successes are because of him. Biden learned from the best...or someone did. He ain't learning nothing.
Great deal by Obama and Biden.
I'm praying against the evil thank you for not responding to me. I waited 15 years to bust mafia that stoled our Patriots jobs china greek Mexicans.verus I  tax insurance hell. No happiness for 50 years constant unemployed lost it all obama biden.
Democratic-run cities coming to the whole country if Biden is elected...
That is correct, Biden no longer has the cognitive ability to be right or wrong.
That is AWESOME! You never see anything that even closely resembles this from Biden supporters. #Trump2020
Biden probably now.
THIS IS A REASONABLE PRESIDENT AND HUMAN.  Vice President Biden, you are up, next.
Taiwanese media is buying into Biden is pro China stuff, they have no idea the BS we have to go through daily with Trump.
We love it. We had a Biden sign there but dozens of reports of stolen signs the last few days.
I'll start taking Biden seriously when he over explains the wonder of rain /s
Oh the delusion. Can you back that up? Trump spoke unscripted for several hours and Biden can‚Äôt read a teleprompter
I chose D. I don't like Biden At. All. But I'm viewing him as the tourniquet - he won't solve any of the underlying problems, but he'll hopefully stop the bleeding long enough that we can take a deep breath and get started on the surgery.
Yeah I think Biden is a doofus too ;^)
In the "apple doesn't fall far from the tree" department, Eric Trump tweeting that Biden selecting Kamala Harris was a " whorrible" choice.  Can't decide if that is purely mysognistic or ignorant spelling or both. #NovemberIsComing #NastyWomenVote #goodbyetrumpfamily

If it‚Äôs too dangerous due to COVID19 to host an in-person DNC in Milwaukee, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris should probably stop parading around in public on the East Coast. We‚Äôre losing millions of dollars because he didn‚Äôt come to accept the nomination here.
Trump gets more done by 8AM than you do, or BIden will in a month.
If Biden wins anyone know the odds of him making through the first year?  Let‚Äôs hope we don‚Äôt have to find out.
Biden made an excellent choice for VP
Biden sucks but what we have sucks more. Pls voteüò≠
Just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and be yourself.  We,Biden-Harris supporters, thank you every time you tweet and open your mouth
Thats why Putin endorsed Biden hey?
At point today does the Biden campaign rollout their new slogan ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt vote for me, vote for the girl‚Äù?
First,¬†Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden‚Äôs racist policies (did she forget?). Next,¬†she ends her pathetic run at President. Then,¬†3 months after ending her own campaign, she reluctantly endorses Biden. After that,¬†Biden gets accused of sexual assault, so he vows to choose a woman

biden and kamala are both FAR from ideal but i‚Äôll be voting for the 150,000 people in this country who died from trumps incompetence because i genuinely don‚Äôt believe we can survive another 4 years under this administration
i am what would be considered far left but i do mot give a fuck who Biden vp is all i need is not orange shit
If you were saying ACAB last month but support Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick you don‚Äôt really believe that all cops are badü•¥
Joe Biden lost lots of people‚Äôs votes after choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate, at least in the state of Wisconsin from what people are tweeting.
Well hopefully in Nov you can help take care of this and the MANY other problems left from the current administration that you &amp; Biden will have to deal with!  Congratulations &amp; Biden made a great choice!!
So Biden (who I would argue is a cop, because of the 94 crime bill) picked Kamala Harris, ANOTHER COP  so our choices are Trump pence (authoritarian dictatorship) or TWO COPS.   Fuck america

Excellent choice in Harris for Biden. She'll make a great VP when sworn in next January.
Excellent choice. Historic choice. America's choice. Could not be happier.
Wait til the debates! When Biden has to speak out of his basement! People will realize he's got dementia! Can you say Trump Relected! If he's such a strong candidate, why has he not left his basement?
Yeah I'll suck it up and vote Biden in my swing state to stop the bleeding. But what we all should focus on is downballot - elect enough progressives that we can put M4A on Biden's desk and call his goddamn bluff.

Biden wants to redirect funding. This is less extreme than abolishing the police. Police are over funded and have been given too much power. If we redirect some (not all) resources towards community programs, we can improve communities instead of over policing them.
He‚Äôll never do it.  For the same reason Biden will never be allowed to debate Trump.
I think I‚Äôm sane, but will NOT be voting for Biden. Can‚Äôt vote for anyone that supports abortions.
Joe Biden trying to distance himself from his record while trying to run on his record will be the most Joe Biden thing in the history of Joe Biden üòÜ
Based on Biden‚Äôs latest series of TV ads, does Obama know that from 2008-2016, Joe was actually POTUS, Commander in Chief, head honcho, the big cheese, etc., and not him?
This is LITERALLY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOTING TRUMP AND BIDEN FOR ME
Of what benefit would a debate be for Joe Biden. There is no upside.

Trump saying biden is against the bible and god makes me actually wanna get behind biden
Yeah, African Americans came from a variety of countries, but overtime the minority has been able to form a more homogeneous census than those of Hispanic roots. I honestly don‚Äôt see how what Biden said was ‚Äúracist‚Äù or ‚Äúproves he has dementia‚Äù I see it to be pretty factual.I just find the echo chamber of far left Twitter overly indulgent and annoying. By any rationale measure (fundraising, media,  organization) the Biden campaign is firing on all cylinders but this edgelord needs to üí© all over it to get likes from üåπTwitter
Bernie endorsed Biden enthusiastically
I mean, it would appear she's doing a pretty good job with Biden's campaign.
How is it that he can say in public to Americans...I'm not going to ALLOW mail in voting.  I'm not going to wait to have them counted and Biden isn't winning. I'm having a the mailboxes removed....WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY PUTTING THEM?  HE IS SO FAR GONE THAT HE THINKS ITS OKAY?!?
Trump will be coming to Oshkosh to speak in person and Biden will hold an online conference. Please, for the love of God do not take this as a sign of weakness on Biden‚Äòs part! There‚Äôs a pandemic and he‚Äôs doing his part to keep you and himself safe.
Let‚Äôs just say in a magical world everyone‚Äôs vote manages to gets to the proper places. Will enough votes be counted to declare Biden the winner. Don‚Äôt think trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan for votes recieved.
Every single Bernie supporter I know is voting for Biden ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Take note that the Democrat Biden-Harris duo's solutions to the "Rona" all involve mandating, to wit forcing the fiefs in the fiefdom, to do something or else. That's their way.
It would kind of be funny though if he had to be physically removed. Or if him and Biden get into a fist fight.
Lol you do realize Biden isn't president yet and hasn't implemented any rules?
And obviously a lot of that‚Äôs down to Biden‚Äôs weakness as a candidate but THIS IS HOW YOU DO CROSSGENERATIONAL APPEAL. Not babbling about your car for a solid minute to an audience of boomer dads who haven‚Äôt voted Dem in over a decade and then adding an aside about electric cars
I would like Mr Pres. not to mention Biden/Harris at all, act as if they don't exists. Dont plant their names in the citizens ears. Talk about leading the country forward, rebuilding the economy, taking a stand on police reform and support, ending anarchy and Covid. MAGA!
Trump is trying to rig the election by taking away a method of voting he believes will help Biden. We have voted by mail in Wisconsin for a long time. It is fair, and it allows Americans to choose who governs them. It terrifies Trump because knows he will lose if we #VoteByMail
A player with COVID was on the Homestead Golf Course earlier this month... Joe Biden says we should all wear masks for 30 months... a peace agreement between Israel and the UAE... in today's WSAU news podcast with Chris Conley.

I for one, think the irony is just a bit that funny 45 has a campaign ad calling Biden racist as he‚Äôs using fancy terms to be racist in his last tweet
Every day, Biden and Harris should do video where they just point at him and laugh. That would make my day.   Video of him saying his usual stupid stuff. Followed with transition pointing and laughing.  The stupid is so strong in him.  No hash/tags or images in comments.

Any vote not for Biden/Kamala is a vote for trump :/
Harris don't be alone with biden he likes boobs and hugging girls and woman  and your going to campaign with him ?
If biden steps down harris takes president isn't speaker of house vp automatically so harris don't get to pick !!!!!!
The only reason biden picked a black woman as vp is for black vote but it's con.he don't care about blacks he's a racists .but he'll drop out she'll take over as president but then pelosi we'll be vp..it crazy and dangerous for true americans  please think before voting for kids

I cry too. We‚Äôre watching trumps plan to sabatoge US mail, preventing delivery. With HIS rule a ballot won‚Äôt count after 11-3. I‚Äôm disappointed that Biden hasn‚Äôt held frequent press conferences alerting voters. He should hold 1 of His own presser after all trumps Covid rallies!
Shocking that a‚Äùpresident‚Äùis openly aloud to abuse His powers to interfere with the delivery of the mail to win an election. Why Isn‚Äôt there ppl pounding the streets in outrage? BIDEN should be holding press conferences on this DAILY! Illegal?UnConstitutional? Will his win stand?

Hasn't NC shown a steady lead for both Biden and Cal?
Of course not! Biden is, rightly, only vetting FEMALE candidates!
One of Biden's most valuable assets is in choosing the women from whom he will choose as his running mate. He's shown more acumen in that than UShitlermurderer and his whole GOP Gestapo team since taking office.

4Open SmartNews to read 'Top GOP senators give Trump the Biden probe he got impeached for trying to force on Ukraine' here:   is a disgraceful asshole and most of us in Wisconsin can't stand him! He is a waste of space!
Trump is the biggest sinner I know.  He has no right to slam Biden about his religion.  Biden goes to church faithfully, does he?  No , he would rather chase pussy, cheat, lie, bullies handicapped people and Gold Star families... what a piece of dirt!
Yes! There are many of us! Unfortunately, we must be diligent until Biden is president and implements a national plan to contain the pandemic. #BlueTsunami2020I'd rather take my chance on Biden and Harris than another 4 years of trump! Trump the world IS laughing at you!!!!
Well, there‚Äôs Biden ads on Fox News! Are there Trump ads on CNN, MSNBC or any other anti-Trump media channels? Asking for a friend!
I‚Äôm not tryna hear ‚Äúnot voting for Biden is a vote for trump‚Äù the ballot is equal bruh it‚Äôs between pedophile cops who don‚Äôt care about us or what the hell we have to say
Might as well of handed Trump the election since we‚Äôre putting Biden and Harris together üôÉü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Biden and Harris. Boy! It sure is fun to see hope return to the country.
I don‚Äôt want to vote for Biden either, but I live in a swing state that barely voted for Trump in 2016, so I probably will. Not exactly thrilled but I expected this.
Joe Biden's choice of Kamala Harris proves that he is not a moderate, and he will be controlled by the radical left if elected. My fellow conservatives, it's time to unite and ensure Biden and Harris never make it to the White House.
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American person on a major party's presidential ticket
I disagree Biden can only beat Trump under the "blue no matter who umbrella"
The dog can put a sentence together better than Hiden Biden!Also it does nothing ro discredit biden or the clintons or even any others that were close with him and continued his legacy. The race baiting is the same as always but now it has. M9re angles. Black supremicists, brown, or even people who are (sexual preference) supremicists.
Can anyone give me a reason why biden deserves my vote without mentioning trump?
If that is an example of your grasp of critical thinking then you belong with Biden
Yup. I think it's great that Biden looked beyond old white men of means.  Imagine an America where candidates, employees, etc aren't notable for gender, race, religion, sexual identity et al. Wouldn't that be amazing? They're all just people. None judged. Just people.
Trump has been careful to respect states rights, yet he is called a tyrant. The first thing biden and kamala support is authoritarian b.s. i think most people that are honest with themselves will be saying orangemans not that bad.
They judge everyone by how they look. It is sad. Thats why biden thinks if you wont vote for him you aint black. I wonder if thats how you get white privledge! Id give it to em. Lol
Joe Biden called the China travel ban xenophobic. Your racist sex offender running mate doesn‚Äôt get a do over and your lack of ethics is showing.
Biden kept our country in stagnant wages while him and democrat/neocon cronies pieced out our economy and sold it to china. He had almost 50 years to do something worthwhile and ruined it worst at every chance.
Good thing it‚Äôs a Biden rally and Election Day voting. If they were voting they would be super spreaders of COVID. But they are safe because it‚Äôs just a Democrat rally.
Like a lot of people on Twitter, I'm not a big fan of Biden and Harris, and I didn't want either of them to be in this position. But you're a damn fool if you think they, and the people theyll bring with won't be much better for America than another 4 years of terror from Trump.
Congratulations! Soon, I will be honored to vote for you and Biden. Looking forward to seeing you debate pence!
He is so right on helping retired single households that lost a partner it is so important!  They need more then half of their total ss benifits
And democrats keep voting for people that watch citizens die in the streets while they live it up. Pelosis district is disgusting yet expensive to live there. The left has ruined every place they have a foot hold. Cant wait to see obama hilary amd biden in cuffs.
Kamala harris is trash. Biden i senile, people watch donald trump lies on msm and believe he is everythin that the democrats do. It is an obviosline of crap. With biden have many sexual assualts and harris being a good democrat soldier.
He spent his life passing racist policies to make single parent black homes and fighting for foreign aid which he later gets a kickback from in the form of his son hunter biden getting no show jobs that pay millions. Russian oligarchs were recently raided by the fbi.
Not to mention Lindsey Graham who has disgraced the memory of his supposed best friend John McCain to kiss up to a coward like Donald Trump who claims McCain wasn't a war hero and mocks his service. Sure Harris and Biden had a moment but nothing like the kiss ass Republicans!!
I think he should have just announced her as his VP pick when the Black Lives Matter Black/Brown people picked Harris it was clear if he didn‚Äôt pick her they would not support him if Rice was picked there would be a revolt I am voting for the Biden/Harris
When will the Biden/Harris knee pads come out?
really disappointed by all the people excited about Kamala as Biden‚Äôs vp
Or sooner if Biden has issues..
Biden said a while ago he was going to pick a woman...therefore, no men are on the VP list.

Joe Biden is no question a gaffe machine and from now until election day he will make several more. The difference between him and Trump is he's a human being who takes responsibility and even apologizes, Trump on the other hand takes no responsibility and apologizes to no one.
He said if Biden wins, China will own our country. üòÇ Out of everyone we owe them the most, 1.1 Trill. The amount of our land &amp; property they own is more mind blowing, &amp; concerning when you see how much of it is located on our waterfronts. #Trump #Biden  #needrealleader
Biden cant speak in coherant sentences.

Biden‚Äôs vp is a Senator and the GOP senators saw the fundraising haul the 24 hours after her announcement. They know she won‚Äôt hesitate to speak the truth.
LIARS! It was Obama/Biden that got ACA. It‚Äôs GOP that has the law suit to take away your healthcare with NO PLAN. It‚Äôs INCOMPENTENT  defunding Social Security &amp; wants to take away Medicare. #FactsMatter
the lesser of two evils for conservatives this year isn‚Äôt trump and Biden its trump and abortion  Is abortion so evil that it warrants voting for someone you consider a bad person because, at the least, he won‚Äôt vocally/financially support/prolong abortion?  Personally, yea
Just play the video of her bashing Biden during the dem debates!!

while i'd love to see everythign pushed further left, it certainly takes the sails out of Trump's "Biden wants to defund the police" fear tactic.
Susan Rice was my first choice with Biden picking Kamala Harris as Attorney Genaral. But I will support the Joe Biden/Kamala Harris ticket
BREAK NEWS for  America‚Äôs independence of energy happened under the OBAMA/BIDEN term with oil production. Plus pushed for solar &amp; wind power. The Green New Deal is a plan to get to cleaner environment to save the planet. Life needs goals.
Also: Biden is a practicing and devout Catholic. What is this dude on about?
Biden/kamala is more extreme than George McGovern in '72. It shall not be another blow-out but it will be very close with third parties doing well. Possible Twelve amendment results.   Winning control of Congress is mandatory this cycle.
In the event Biden/Harris wins, who are the leading candidates for that newly open CA Senate seat? Barbara Lee? Ro Khanna?
Hope she can debate because hidden Joe Biden is in his basement!!

So first we were voting for Joe Biden and now because a former cop is his Vice President, we‚Äôre not voting at all? So we‚Äôre just gonna sit by and watch Trump take the country again hunh?
Biden does nothing for many of us....not the point of this election. A crazy man needs to be stopped.

STEALING BIDEN CAMPAIGN SLOGAN!
He wouldn't be up to a demanding job. I'm sure he'd agree... in fact, he's been retired for nearly fifteen years.  With Biden we're in a "who's kidding whom?" moment. He looks physically diminished and, unlike my new friend, Biden also looks mentally diminished. It happens.
I just came home from a golf outing. I played with a man who will turn 80 in October. In other words, he's only about two years older than Joe Biden.  He was very nice and still pretty sharp, and we had a good time. But he's also obviously old and physically weakened by age.
Never-Trumpers:  I'm sitting here listening to Anthony Scaramucci make an utter fool of himself on Steve Hilton's show on Fox, trying to defend his support for Biden.  If you ever needed proof these Trump-hating "neo-cons" are insane, this has been it!  Zero credibility.
I think fox has been testing the waters and is preparing  for rejection or acceptance  into the new prevailing winds of november. Their top office people donate to Biden,  I hear. After Trump  wins I think he may change the play book . So far fox is neutral  to left it seems?
I have seen some Biden signs. But I live in a very liberal community. There were many more Clinton signs 4 years ago than Biden signs now.

I'm voting long term.  Biden vs Trump is a short term problem with serious consequences but both will maintain the status quo.  The SQ being zero representation.  Any votes for strong progressives, socialists, Greens are the future.  The sooner we push them forward the better.

More than that even, we need to push progressives hard into local elections so they become the national figures down the road. Biden-type candidates can't get the nod when the farm system is all AOC's. We're terrible at that, unlike the GOP.
I don't care how much you don't like Biden's VP pick, vote for them.   We cannot have another four years of Trump. We can't.

I keep getting ads in YouTube about how Biden is far to the left and that poses a danger to families. And it's like bitch where? Where's this far left you speak of
I was thinking the same thing. She was out fast and was like BIDEN! LETS GOOOOO!!
She is a sellout. Look into what she actually thinks of Biden... guess she‚Äôs OK with sexual misdoncut and racism, now that she‚Äôll be VP
All he needs to do his bring up how she thinks Biden is a racist and that she believes his accusers. She is a sellout. He had so many better options
Does she still believe Biden‚Äôs accusers? Think he is racist?? Not anymore because it‚Äôll help her career
She thinks Biden is a racist and believes his accusers, far away from who I would invent. She is in it for her own career, not the people she serves
Well I'm at least glad for one thing.  We no longer have to hear news stories about how Biden is going to announce his VP choice tomorrow.
She is an absolute sellout. Thinks Biden is a racist but will be his VP gladly. She‚Äôs in it for herself not the people
She hurt the black communities of California and laughed about it. So many better options and Biden picked her
She is a sellout! Does she still think Biden is a racist?? Absolutely appalling
He should‚Äôve picked Val Demings. Kamala is a clear sellout who has attacked Biden for his very controversial past
She is an absolute sellout. She thinks Biden is a racist, but will be his VP? Shows where her priorities are huh
She is such a sellout. Anything for political prowess. She clearly had her opinions about Biden, but anything for more power! Ridiculous
Terrible choice. Val Demings was the way to go but when has Biden ever been that on top of his game. Makes me worried for November
I don‚Äôt support trump. I think Biden would‚Äôve been better suited selecting Rep. Val Demings. But to each their own...
She is a sellout... repeatedly emphasized that she thought Biden was a racist and sexual predator. Anything for power I guess...
She is a total sellout. Just months ago she believed Biden‚Äôs accusers and pinned him down for his remarks on segregation.
She will do anything for power. Months ago she called Biden a racist and that she believed his accusers. Total sellout!
Anything to move up politically. Just months ago she thought Biden was a racist and said she believed his sexual misconduct accusers.

Election night will be wonderful to see Green Party go over 5%.  I don't want to see a Trump win but to be honest a Biden loss would be sweet as apple pie.
I know some strong Bernie supporters and strong leftists but I know they are thinking about voting Biden just to remove Trump.   They don't want to but are so concerned about another 4 years of this asshole.   I do understand them but the Dems need to go get their votes elsewhere

I'm obviously NOT voting for Biden LMFAO... But I'm torn between wanting to vote Jo Jo or Trump. I feel Trump has let us all down, he constantly caves into liberals. I feel Jo Jo would be different, the Maverick we all want. Fuck the system!

If VP were just in charge of foreign policy or if Joe Biden's polling with Black, Latino and Asian voters were higher than Hillary's I would agree.  The problem is he needs to win and win big to overcome all the shenanigans that the trump campaign are going to engage in.

Hey, I like him! Biden is the closet pedophile though...well, actually the out in the open pedophile (they‚Äôll blame it on his dementia)
How do I vote for the version of Joe Biden that Trump thinks he is?
Bleh, msnbc is making hay out of Biden's comments yesterday. üò™
There are two reasons I'm voting for Joe Biden: 1. KAMALA asked me to. 2. More people will die if we don't get rid of trump and I'm not a complete asshole.
Save your tweet, because Biden‚Äôs apologies will be coming often. He can‚Äôt make a single statement that doesn‚Äôt cause people to scratch their heads.The question remains are these his real feelings or is his dimentia getting worse.If he‚Äôs going to become President, we need to know!
There is a great irony Donald Trump claiming that Biden "hurt the Bible" and "hurt God."   Plus bonus points for conflating being "against God and against guns."
If the DNC really wanted to get rid of Trump they wouldn't have run such a weak candidate and supported such a lame platform.  So don't blame me for what is totally at the feet of the DNC.  If they pull off a Biden win they will have to do it without me.  #DemExit

I've admired you my entire life. Your songs have helped me find strength and courage and love. I am beyond devastated that you would support a candidate who is beyond evil and corrupt. Biden belongs in prison and Kamala helps set criminals free. You've lost all respect from me üò¢
Is it Coma, or Camilla or Kamala? Biden just pronounced her name 3 or 4 different ways.  Does he know her name?
Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump‚Äôs fault.
How long will it take you to realize a balanced budget amendment is a terrible economic idea, and admit you lied to 5th graders? I put my money on Biden.

Wow team Trump accusing anyone of sexual assault is so hypocritical. Guess who wasn‚Äôt on pedo island, joe Biden. Guess who paid off the families of 5 10-year-olds who they molested? Trump. Who has bragged about sexual assault? Trump
If white women are willing to kneel in the street for their guilt, I‚Äôm sure they think Biden will now get their vote.
I am quite happy tonight. Great VP pick and my chosen candidates are winning their spots. Best one is Roger Polack, the first best Democratic opponent for the first district. He's going to give Steil a fight. Ordered my Biden/Harris yard sign, too.
Both Biden and Trump are despicable people with shady histories. It‚Äôs sad we‚Äôre in a situation where we need to pick the lesser of two evils here

Pure bullshit. However, what happened to Kamala saying she believed every single one of Biden‚Äôs accusers? What happened to her saying he was racist? What happened to her sleeping her way to the top? What type of condition is her district in? Shall I go on??
Stay excited! You're voting for more than just Biden/Harris. You're voting for RBG's replacement. You're voting to replace Barr and DeVos and the rest of his crony cabinet.  No ticket is perfect but people evolve and still have flaws.
Not joe Biden chose kamala Harris as his VP?????????? Feels real anti-black in HERE

Most women, and more than a quarter of the black people I know were on the fence. Most have jumped to Trump, and some are still on the fence. No new people are supporting Biden now.
Congratulations! Can't wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris!
This will be interesting. All Trump supporters I know are excited by the Kamala pick. Her past and her hypocrisy will be highlighted. I was genuinely surprised to see the support. It is an uphill battle now for Biden.
As a conservative roaming in the wilderness and looking for a reason to vote Biden, Duckworth ain‚Äôt it.  Don‚Äôt like her and can‚Äôt explain why.
I hope Biden waits for Trump to come out to his daily propaganda dump and then announces the name. My guess is everyone (but FoxNews of course) cuts away from Trump.

Damn near convinced me to vote for Biden. I say damn near cause fuck that's a tough pill to swallow. Like the idea has me bitter but you make A REALLY solid case.
Both Biden and Harris are running on illegal platforms.  They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to run at all.  They‚Äôre criminals.
I see it a lot. Kind of can‚Äôt fix stupid. Looking forward to a Biden presidency ‚ù£Ô∏è
She‚Äôs just as bad as joe Biden. Get her out
vote biden make parody possible again
he has a ton of state level shit coming at him in New york right so biden and kamala arent needed
garbage take ben! biden's comments were silly, but they were courageous (he stood against his jew hating base &amp; obama-era "advisors") + signified he doesn't want to make a political issue out of middle east peace. which is 100% right &amp; should be supported
biden's praising the deal was an act of courage given his jew hating base.  his claiming credit was of course ridiculous, but maybe he gets a pass here for showing at least a hint of spine.
Because Biden is the centerist with the most popularity and easiest to mold.  Bernie is a leftist therefore will lose like McGaven did you Nixon
What year was this made? It looks like it was made for an 80‚Äôs movie about how animation would be in the future. And no one gives a crap about trains...it‚Äôs 2020. When was the last time you even rode in a train? And why wouldn‚Äôt Biden just take a plane, like a normal person?
Voters pick Biden?  What kind of sick morons do we have in this country?  Where‚Äôd you take the poll‚ÄîNYC?
We critique Biden and every conservative troll comes out of nowhere like "U THINK UR TOO GOOD TO VOTE FOR BIDEN HUHHHHHHH? U THINK UR BETTER THAN ME AND THE DNC? HUH?????" like relax I can critique the guy because I don't blindly follow my leader like he's God
This is a good middle of the road statement &amp; good on joe for issuing it knowing it would disappoint the rabid Jew haters in his base  But man oh man does it come so so close to recognizing how Trump putting annexation on the table (that biden criticized him for) led to the deal
No he is not lol. Trumps atmosphere is literally white supremacy Biden is most likely a racist but he‚Äôs not out there in the open with it
dont play dumb  everyone knows that haley is on deck for gop nomination  biden had a number of good candidates w/ far less baggage that harris -- he box checking certainly was a big factor
a lebanese street that rejects hezbollah is one that is almost certainly less interested in anti-israel demagoguery thats a big shift.  trump's squeeze on iran has helped put hezbollah into a corner.  will biden really offer them a life raft?  hard to imagine...
if you look at the big picture, the regional rivals are turkey, sa and iran (israel is a regional actor, but doesn't have interest in controlling lebanon or syria).  you'll recall trump was surprising acquiescing to saudi rival erdogan.  would biden have been?
but the most likely outcome of a biden presidency is continuation of the generally pro-saudi us foreign policy that was our norm for decades before obama and that trump restored.
i dont think biden has the same attachments as obama had to iran. biden is likely emotionally far more in line with long standing american/saudi partnership.  he's gonna have to make some gestures towards restoring jcpoa and he'll have people around him who are true believers..
i mean this feels kind of tinfoil hat but the main thing thats changed vis biden is he selected the relatively sympathetic to israel harris over the more hostile to israel rice. but i dont see how to spin that into a theory as rice will still play prominent role (sec state?)
i'm still not sure what this means. open alliance w israel allows iran to portray mbs as a muslim sell out, that doesn't help him.  quiet alliance was never in jeopardy.  how any of this helps vis a biden presidency (which he has to be anticipating) i dont get the theory
this is the real reason biden picked kamala, to pre-empt these stories had nikki haley been first indian american on ticket in 2024
Trump fulfilled his role, now it‚Äôs time for Biden to fulfill his
I agree riots do change things, but it can‚Äôt do it alone.  We need to get people in there that are also sympathetic to our cause, not that Biden is, but down ballot progressives
If we do not act and sit out like we have been esp during the Obama years I agree not much will change.  I don‚Äôt like Biden I hate that he‚Äôs the pick, however I see as the best ways to move forward and expose the weakness of both parties
Do you agree that it will either be Biden or Trump come November, pending shenanigans at the convention?
There are key points in here that I don‚Äôt feel Biden hits which which is why I don‚Äôt consider Biden a fascist  Thoughts comrades?
I think he‚Äôs facist adjacent.  Because he still supports social change.  Biden himself is vacant of principles and bends whatever the party is leaning
What qualifies Biden as a facsist to you?
I like my suburb.  I like my synagogue / day schools / faith community. If Biden wins, I can‚Äôt keep those things.  Trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue (which is less unusual then it used to be fwiw) and I would still vote for him.
genuinely curious if this hinged on biden picking Harris (who isn‚Äôt particularly interested in foreign policy) over Iranian Asset Susan Rice, who would‚Äôve taken it personally and settled scores if she perceived uae + israel and doing something that could help Trump
Ya Hilary was only ever up by 3 points Biden has been up by more than 8.  She still won by 3 points but lost where it counted.  Dont insult my fucking intelligence
Clearly not since Biden has been doing very wells in the polls and the battleground states.
"If you don't vote for my preferred candidate, you hate the country and the constitution" is essentially the propaganda you're trying to force on people lol.  If you think Biden or Trump are the solution, you're part of the problem unfortunately.
Completely different scenario.  Hilary was only up by 2-3 points and not where it mattered.  Biden is up by 8 in most of the battleground states.
Wah trump gonna win cuz I feel so.  Biden isn‚Äôt doing what I want so now trumps gonna win wah
Trumps website is a store or his official election website has only a donation page. There is no policy whatsoever. Biden‚Äôs has a real plan for America. Trump has nothing to offer!!
well she's clearly really black because she supports biden and i'm told thats the measure of it
i dont think its overly cynical to suspect that newsweak decided to amplify him / his pet issue to help Biden tho
well then why did he write it then exactly?  team biden is desperate for any hint of racism directed at kamala so they can make her more palatable to the working class black voters who passed on her in the primaries bc she built her career locking their kids up. why help them?
i dunno man.  the left has nominally been coopted by globalists (biden &amp; harris), but they seem rightfully confident that they will get their red meat too  its very predictable that we are going to now do our best to draw lots of little tiny circles &amp; insist anyone outside..  1/
It took me straight to Biden! Only on Goo__le. Not duck duck go though.
guys remember the key thing about mail in ballots is they aren't secret.  your kids want to try to vote biden? #disown.  grandma likes joe?  she can do her own damn shopping in the middle of covid.  wifey thinks kamala is charming...?
well there's gonna be some good jobs clean stuff up now so god bless....  coming soon to a suburb near you if biden wins.
So, you‚Äôre implying that people with low incomes are criminals?  Doesn‚Äôt the low income bracket make up 80% of your base?  Who is your strategist - I think he might really work for Biden ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
Its not about pushing him left it‚Äôs putting in An opponent we can fight and use to further our cause.  Trump fulfilled his role it‚Äôs time Biden to fulfill his
Bernie came so close to winning and has made socialism a positive thing then we come and throw all the good will he‚Äôs been throwing because we lose twice and now we are like fuck it.  When we get in Biden and bully the shit out of him and continue to fight for our shit
I agree. They gain absolutely nothing by picking her as VP.  Wonder if they intentionally want to lose so they don't even have to worry about replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, which is a nightmare scenario to navigate.
If Biden is Catholic then I‚Äôm Jewish!
Biden is literally the only viable choice.  The greens have never gotten over 2.5% and they are only on 24 ballots.  If you wana build the party you have to work the ground up not top down
Not at all.  It remains his goal to remove trump and the best way to do that is through Biden, unless shenanigans
I‚Äôm not voting. I don‚Äôt like Trump but I also don‚Äôt like Biden.
Honestly why are people acting so surprised   You weren‚Äôt gonna be happy no matter his choice instead of making excuses just be honest and you weren‚Äôt ever voting for Biden geebus
‚ÄúHis handlers picked‚Äù...we can stop pretending to not know that Biden is being allowed to make any decisions in his condition.
To be fair, Biden didn‚Äôt choose. He was given a list of black chicks he had to pick from. He doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.
It‚Äôs not ‚Äútrying‚Äù or ‚Äúweak‚Äù when he just hangs that biden bigotry right out in the open everytime a camera turns on.
i imagine its more of an uphill struggle than team biden might want to generate enthusiasm for a former, lets call it, *over-enthusiastic* prosecutor. tryna frame her as a target of racism &amp; hope mort klein comes through with some idiocy to back it up seems like the natural play
Motherfucker it didn‚Äôt matter what Biden did you weren‚Äôt voting for him stop fucking lying

Just want to clarify I am voting for Biden in hopes of a progressive cabinet &amp; general tone shift. But there is a subsection of liberals, often white, that are satisfied with the optics of caring about people rather than the ‚Äúextreme‚Äù policies needed to actually bring about   1/2
Honestly? No, not really. However I will still gladly vote for Biden and Harris because they're a lot better than the alternative.
Not me knocking hundreds of doors for Bernie with a broken foot in a conservative neighborhood in Iowa just for a biden kamala ticket....

This is proof that Biden is clearly superior to #45 on two matters: He is unafraid of strong, smart women and He doesn't hold petty grudges.

Trump might call Biden's VP pick 'Crazy Kamala.' But she'll relish taking on him, bland Mike Pence.
Well Biden just sealed the election for Trump.
Well we knew it was happening.  We know it was gonna be her.  All I‚Äôm gonna say as I always try to frame things positively is Khive is gonna go and calm tf down.  Same with the Karen‚Äôs if Biden wins.  Let‚Äôs just appease them so they get the Fucc out of the way
Why do you think nothing will change?  What makes you think Biden will hold up everything trump has torn down?
Translated: Trump is angered and insulted because Biden is choosing a woman as a running mate.  #TrumpIsAMisogynist
my understanding of the polls is trump does well when it comes to *favorability* -- older and working class black voters *like* him more than the establishment would have it, and if D candidate was Bernie, Warren or Pete, Trump would have a chance w them, but Biden is their *guy*
Vote Biden and down ballot progressives
We had that chance in the primaries with Bernie.  Unless shenanigans go down Biden is the onlynother Viable option that will get the White House
i suspect trump is going to get a record low percent of the black vote.  Biden is their man  &amp; esp. if he does pick a black women VP who will be POTUS before term is up ‚Äî they aren‚Äôt gonna be able to hide his dementia for four years. No one can stay in a basement that long
Trump not picking the next supreme court nominee is important enough for me to vote for Biden
Who‚Äôs easier to handle Biden when all the Karen‚Äôs go away Or Trump and the liberals are still Malding and coming out to vote for there shit candidates
Mayor Pete is trending. Supposedly he has taken  flight to Delaware. Now if Biden picks a white male as veep after all this black woman who hah then we knows he‚Äôs going senile. Not a better way to totally piss off 2 parts of his base, woman blacks, and women in general!

This quote from Joe Biden speaks volumes:
just Gonna leave this here #KamalaHarris
I wonder how surprised Joe Biden was when he found out he picked Kamala Harris for VP?
She went on the record stating that Biden is guilty of sexual assault tho lol obviously right wing will run with that and the left won't care, but I still think it's funny
Finally after all these years of sucking dick under the desk she comes up on top and Biden doesn‚Äôt even know who she is? Ha ha Ha

She never had a chance. Voters had their minds made up before debates. Was always Biden or Bernie.
Gee Lindsay.... tell us again what a great guy Joe Biden is.  Damned the Putin machine must have real dirt on you.
LIke is she trying to campaign for Biden?

The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phone
Trans people aren‚Äôt allowed to point out she was f*cking TRANSPHOBIC? (I‚Äôm obvi still voting biden, I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs ignorant and entitled to say that trans people don‚Äôt have VALID CRITICISM for Kamala)
Growing weaker and weaker...like when your wife was dying and you divorced her because you couldn‚Äôt honor your marriage vows, cheating on her and abandoning her? That‚Äôs what this tweet brings to mind.  Biden is fine and will be fine, and Harris will be a great support.
Former Clinton White House spokesman Robert Weiner tells  &amp;  that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris need to visit Wisconsin after next weeks DNC.
'Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, similarly said during another radio interview this week that the evidence his committee had uncovered was so "outrageous" that "it should completely disqualify Biden from president."'

Tony Perez, DNC chairman; ‚Äúunless you are pro-choice there is no room for you in the Dem. Party‚Äù. Biden, flip flop on Hyde amendment. Abortion until birth. Obviously a warp sense of moral and civil decency. 64% of abortions are black/brown, systemic racism.
Horrible hypocrite Harris? The same lady who said she believes Biden's sexual assault accusers then accepts his offer of VP? The same lady that admitted to smoking pot while locking up thousands for doing the same? The same lady that called out Biden for being racist? LOL!...

Biden, Harris haul in $48 million in 48 hours | Fox News
40 years of Biden says otherwise. I don‚Äôt like either party, try evaluating bother scum bags without bias. Cam will ball out ü§üüèª
Pres. Trump will host events aimed at attacking his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, on Monday in Wisconsin and Minnesota and on Tuesday in Arizona.
I've had the same thought.  Obviously they are pointed at Trump, but Biden doesn't exactly come across as functioning either.
My town is filled with yard signs that say "Any Functioning Adult 2020." I tend to think that is those people. Although it's debatable whether Biden is still a functioning adult lol.
I worry that now the Biden-Sanders working groups have done their work and Harris has been chosen, Biden advisors feel they have "sewn up" their bases of support and will now pivot to the Wall Street centrists.
The Trump campaign officially releases details of President Donald Trump's trip to Oshkosh on Monday.  He'll be speaking about "Joe Biden‚Äôs failures on Jobs and the Economy" at an airport hangar.
From  campaign. Monday, August 17, 2020 at 4:30 PM CDT President Donald J. Trump to deliver remarks on Joe Biden‚Äôs failures on Jobs and the Economy Basler Flight Service in Oshkosh, WI.
Clearly not. Fair elections, without interference and accepting the results are the foundation of this country. Everything else is built on that. Assuming Biden wins this needs his attention on day 1.
Her and Biden are just as bad. There‚Äôs years and years of evidence just look at both sides corruption and then vote gold
For days, all I've heard is Harris will beat up Pence. Yawn. Two corporate stooges arguing whose corporate masters are better doesn't interest me.   But no one is talking about the Biden-Trump debates. I wonder why. That's going to be hilarious!!
Issue with both Trump and Biden I meant.
I think this is a compound problem of being both an issue with and an issue with Biden.  I think Biden needs to keep getting his messaging out strong about what he's going to do to help American's Healthcare system.
The thing that chaps my ass the most is when they say a third party vote is a vote for Trump to try and guilt me into going along with Biden.
Girl-make up your mind.   Trump isn't a republican like your father is.  He is a nazi wanna be. I suggest in honor of your Dad, sidestep the assohole and support Biden/Harris for a change.  Do you want your child growing up in Nazi era??? Your choice!
I have read multiple pieces on how the election will be stolen. Honestly it's mindblowing what I think we will be in for IF the election goes to Biden. The thing that infuriates me is that supporters will see nothing wrong with it and be like "OMG get over it"
Listen I get that Biden and Harris are not good on pro-life policies, but Trump isn‚Äôt either. Pro-life means being pro-life from conception until natural death. Trump is not that
Washed up "never was" actor endorses #LoserTrump #UrineTroubleTrump "President wanna be dictator", You must be so proud. See You Nov.3 when We take back back the Senate and #ClaimOurFate by electing Biden/Harris.

Biden is responsible for American empire‚Äôs atrocities such as drone striking a half dozen Middle East countries and Harris is responsible for keeping innocent people, including Sirhan, at the behest of the Agency, behind bars. You really think these palpatines are an answer?

---&gt;Joe Biden: Puppet of the Progressive Left? via    via
What about  approach? He‚Äôs #VoteBiden &amp; he regularly discusses it, arguing that the left should view the election as essentially ‚Äúchoosing ur opponent.‚Äù Nonetheless, he still consistently roasts Dems (incl Biden/Harris). Isn‚Äôt this fine? Why consider misinforming ppl?
There‚Äôs a part of me that believes Biden won‚Äôt make it out of August.  I could really see him except a nomination and then around Labor Day step down.
I wish, it's clear that Biden was always going to be the presidential nominee. Everything else was just "performance art" and Bernie's futile trying.  I have to say, Markey might have actually been a stronger candidate than Bernie based on this ad, though.

Ruining the country just like Obama and Biden did. Big decisions or big Bombs? Dems like you are why Trump will still get a lot of votes. You‚Äôre out of your mind.
Joe Biden had a plan to strengthen unions - not dismantle them.
Biden has been a politician for over 40 years and has done nothing to earn a single vote from anyone. Kamala robo cop Harris has ruined many lives to get where she is. Instead of voting for evil on either side I‚Äôll vote for a respectable candidate. You the one sleepin
You know Obama and Biden did that too right?......
All Biden or  has to do to win this election is make an add like "Are you mad that football is cancelled? Blame President Trump! His failure to protect the country from the Corona Virus has cancelled football &amp; killed 170,000 Americans"
The elation of seeing a Biden sign in the yard of A Decent Human Being after the building rage with every passing trump sign is so real. WI better not give Mr. Cheeto the satisfaction of winning us.

Biden would do a better job at governing, management, coordination, diplomacy, national security, human rights, economic growth with environmental conservation, social justice, institutions of health, safety and welfare, infrastructure planning, etc.  Trump doesn't do anything.
The cages started with the Obama/Biden administration. What part of that do you not get?

President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected former Vice President and Presidential Candidate Joe Biden‚Äôs call for a national mask mandate to combat the coronavirus.
How can anybody actually vote for Biden???? He is literally out of his fucking mind.... besides being a Pedo, he sounds like he‚Äôs almost asleep every time he speaks.
I wanted to play an online game and there was a Joe Biden commercial first on a game site. He ain't messing around
For example, broadly speaking I view Biden v Trump as:  -Getting better‚ùå -Not getting worse‚ùå -Getting worse (Biden) -Getting far worse (Trump)  That‚Äôs not to say I discourage voting Biden, I just think it‚Äôs necessary to be brazenly honest about him &amp; his prospective presidency.
Hard agree. If someone is hung up on a Biden/Harris ticket, they haven‚Äôt been paying attention these past four years. This election is deadly serious. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say he‚Äôs destroying everything he touches.
Agreed, I just contend that when discussing candidates/policies, it‚Äôs imperative that we distinguish (A) ways Biden/Dems = less bad than Trump/GOP (‚Äúnot getting worse‚Äù) FROM (B) ways Biden/Dems/progressives will actually [materially] improve upon the status quo (‚Äúgetting better‚Äù)
Yes. Joe Biden supporters are corny weirdos that worship CNN.
I dislike the Clintons more than either Harris or Biden, and Harris IS better than Tim Kaine
Rather this cult then jumping on Biden‚Äôs lap. And making the hairs on his leg stand up.
I'm pretty sure  would poll at over 20% within a week of debating Biden and Trump. Her plan on criminal justice reform alone makes Biden's look like nothing more than an attempt to grab votes with no real change (oh wait, that's exactly what it is)
So yeah, Biden/Harris may not be the candidates I'm in love with, but I know who don't like, and I'll be using my vote to vote against Trump, who I believe is bringing the US closer to fascism every day.
I mean, the Biden/Harris administration will probably appoint people who are *not* actively out to destroy portions of the government, including the EPA, Dept of Education, CDC, USPS, etc...
Which brings me to Biden/Harris... people are bitching about them already, but like... They may not be your first choice, but I guarantee they are better than Trump and better than a flaming bag of dog shit...
Desperation from desperate people. Trump will lose. And your little tweets won‚Äôt gain new supporters. Update your resume. Joe Biden is a decent man. Trump is not.

Strange strategy for Joe Biden to pick an extremely unlikable VP candidate that moderates don't even like. Not to mention the fact Harris called Biden a 'racist' and said she believes his accusers. To be fair though, Joe is so senile, I doubt he remembers any of that happened.

Oh that‚Äôs hysterical, you thinking you have a shot at turning NY red. That‚Äôs like saying Biden thinks he has a shot at turning Texas blue. Wait...
WisDems is having a weekend of action on 8/29-30 where we‚Äôll be calling voters to help elect Biden-Harris as well as Dems up and down the ticket. Sign up at the link below!
Trump is upset b/c Biden said it should be a mandate everyone should wear a mask. It Trump hadn't called the Pandemic a hoax so many people wouldn‚Äôt be fighting wearing mask. Trump causes more problems than solutions. Nice someone is being a leader.

No, Joe Biden can't ban voucher schools in Wisconsin
No, Joe Biden can't ban voucher schools in Wisconsin
When I see people talking about voting for Biden/Harris, it always feels like someone telling a vegetarian that the all-meat restaurant they are going to is fine because "they have a black bean burger"
Biden opposes vouchers, but experts say the president wouldn't have the authority to halt a program authorized and funded by the state.

I chose to interpret it as a gratuitious Biden-Harris endorsement.
You really think that? I'm not as confident in Biden winning as some are, but I can't really see this being a Trump landslide.
Un, didn't Sunrise Movement just endorse Biden. Me soooo confuseded!
Biden's trip was much longer
Biden 2020 right there!! Lol
My guess is an anarchist that supports Biden this election to kick out Trump
2020 Pres Candidates as NFL QBs   Biden: Ryan Fitzpatrick. Old White placeholder who hasn‚Äôt done much in terms of success  Harris: Tua Tagovailoa. Young potential non-white  ‚Äúsuperstar‚Äù in waiting  Trump: Roethlisberger. Repulsive, rapey, but has a few W‚Äôs.   Pence: Jake Fromm
No, Joe Biden can't ban school choice vouchers in Wisconsin (though he's strongly against them). We rate this claim False, after a quick stopover to examine the pseudo-news site spreading this claim.
Certainly seems like Biden will likely lose
Biden and Heels Up Harris can kiss my a**! Both cheeks.
Haha, when will the "press" ask Biden a question...about Antifa...or anything??? That is a good one!!
Biden, to a screaming Jim Boylen just offstage: "Listen bald . . ."
Dear everyone - this is the kind of decision that won't ever happen again if Biden wins. Dems will immediately pack courts so enough anti-2A judges will outweigh the constitutionally-minded ones.
I would not be surprised if the Biden Harris group said you two ask a question, we won't reply but it will show the "press" is asking ???'s. #suchafarce
It's remarkable, and  just nodded and gleefully invited the nitwit back.  I mean, really. What possibly could a voter "learn" about Biden now and actually say, "Yeah, Trump has flaws, but NOTHING like that!" ????  Do better, CNN.  #TrumpFailedAmerica
Trump will defeat Biden and the Usurper with ease.
I‚Äôm guessing that the people who think I can be shamed into voting for Biden have never purchased a fucking Groupon for dental care. Sorry motherfuckers but I have no shame left!
So this "chicken or shit&amp;glass" analogy is the newest way libs are dismissing criticisms of Biden as ludicrously petty.  But it ignores that badly cooked chicken can kill you &amp; it ignores what critics are actually saying - the chicken is stuffed w/ shit&amp; glass.
Here in Wisconsin people are seriously pissed at the Democrats for cancelling the DNC. Very smart of Trump to visit! Wisconsin people, for the most part, are independent and self sustaining. They will definitely appreciate Trump visiting and despise Biden cancelling.

Your role in this is to vote &amp; to engage others--not the Trumpsters who are too far gone but all the people who think Kamala isn't sufficiently progressive or Biden isn't Bernie or voting is a hassle. Stop trying to win over Trump fans &amp; start working on the passive &amp; undecided.
The appeal to "suburban housewives," the threat that Biden will "hurt God," the promise that "Christianity will have power"--Trump is publicly manipulating religion, fear, and racism. Meanwhile, we're joking about how he pronounces Yosemite or how much orange makeup he's wearing.
I just heard a pundit on CNN say that the big gap in the polls right now is because voters don't know enough about Biden.  Do these crackpots listen to themselves? By what barometer will Biden -- a two-term VP, by the way -- lose support to Trump over the next 10 weeks?
The ads on TV for Trump and against Biden are disgusting. Truly disgusting.
point on  about Joe Biden's MAGA POV is so relevant. When I saw him speak in MKE I was surprised and disappointed by Biden's Americentric, patriotism/nationalism.
Also, I think  is at the point in listenership and subscribers where they can afford to edit in the actual clip of Joe Biden asking if his interviewers are junkies or at least play it off your phone
Trans people aren‚Äôt allowed to point out she was f*cking TRANSPHOBIC? (I‚Äôm obvi still voting biden, I‚Äôm just saying that it‚Äôs ignorant and entitled to say that trans people don‚Äôt have VALID CRITICISM for Kamala)
Growing weaker and weaker...like when your wife was dying and you divorced her because you couldn‚Äôt honor your marriage vows, cheating on her and abandoning her? That‚Äôs what this tweet brings to mind.  Biden is fine and will be fine, and Harris will be a great support.

Horrible hypocrite Harris? The same lady who said she believes Biden's sexual assault accusers then accepts his offer of VP? The same lady that admitted to smoking pot while locking up thousands for doing the same? The same lady that called out Biden for being racist? LOL!...

How unsettling would it be if Boylen showed up at a Biden campaign event and made a point of getting on camera to say, "I believe in Kamala Harris!" Would any reasonably plausible behavior from a public figure be more jarring?

I've had the same thought.  Obviously they are pointed at Trump, but Biden doesn't exactly come across as functioning either.
My town is filled with yard signs that say "Any Functioning Adult 2020." I tend to think that is those people. Although it's debatable whether Biden is still a functioning adult lol.
I worry that now the Biden-Sanders working groups have done their work and Harris has been chosen, Biden advisors feel they have "sewn up" their bases of support and will now pivot to the Wall Street centrists.
If you're voting for Joe Biden, you vote on November 4th!
The Trump campaign officially releases details of President Donald Trump's trip to Oshkosh on Monday.  He'll be speaking about "Joe Biden‚Äôs failures on Jobs and the Economy" at an airport hangar.

Clearly not. Fair elections, without interference and accepting the results are the foundation of this country. Everything else is built on that. Assuming Biden wins this needs his attention on day 1.
Her and Biden are just as bad. There‚Äôs years and years of evidence just look at both sides corruption and then vote gold
For days, all I've heard is Harris will beat up Pence. Yawn. Two corporate stooges arguing whose corporate masters are better doesn't interest me.   But no one is talking about the Biden-Trump debates. I wonder why. That's going to be hilarious!!
Don't worry- based on the Biden/Harris roll-out, Trump's not losing.
Where's all the media uproar about "it's not about your rights"? Where's MSNBC calling Biden a wannabe dictator and autocrat?  Oh, lefties, you are in for an ugly surprise in November.
Issue with both Trump and Biden I meant.
I think this is a compound problem of being both an issue with and an issue with Biden.  I think Biden needs to keep getting his messaging out strong about what he's going to do to help American's Healthcare system.
The thing that chaps my ass the most is when they say a third party vote is a vote for Trump to try and guilt me into going along with Biden.
Girl-make up your mind.   Trump isn't a republican like your father is.  He is a nazi wanna be. I suggest in honor of your Dad, sidestep the assohole and support Biden/Harris for a change.  Do you want your child growing up in Nazi era??? Your choice!
I have read multiple pieces on how the election will be stolen. Honestly it's mindblowing what I think we will be in for IF the election goes to Biden. The thing that infuriates me is that supporters will see nothing wrong with it and be like "OMG get over it"
Listen I get that Biden and Harris are not good on pro-life policies, but Trump isn‚Äôt either. Pro-life means being pro-life from conception until natural death. Trump is not that

Simple fact: Almost every country wants Biden. Why? He‚Äôs better for them than Trump. Trump is focused on making the USA great. Biden, Obama, etc were focused on letting the world take advantage of us.

There‚Äôs a part of me that believes Biden won‚Äôt make it out of August.  I could really see him except a nomination and then around Labor Day step down.
I wish, it's clear that Biden was always going to be the presidential nominee. Everything else was just "performance art" and Bernie's futile trying.  I have to say, Markey might have actually been a stronger candidate than Bernie based on this ad, though.

You know Obama and Biden did that too right?......
All Biden or  has to do to win this election is make an add like "Are you mad that football is cancelled? Blame President Trump! His failure to protect the country from the Corona Virus has cancelled football &amp; killed 170,000 Americans"

Trump will probably win with a similar result. Biden cleaning up in the cities but rurals going hard Trump.
These polls all prove one thing: our liberal media remains far too powerful. If people think Biden is a moderate, it‚Äôs because the media lies about him.
Yeah...this is indeed what your media is gonna look like if Biden wins, folks.
How can anybody actually vote for Biden???? He is literally out of his fucking mind.... besides being a Pedo, he sounds like he‚Äôs almost asleep every time he speaks.
I wanted to play an online game and there was a Joe Biden commercial first on a game site. He ain't messing around
For example, broadly speaking I view Biden v Trump as:  -Getting better‚ùå -Not getting worse‚ùå -Getting worse (Biden) -Getting far worse (Trump)  That‚Äôs not to say I discourage voting Biden, I just think it‚Äôs necessary to be brazenly honest about him &amp; his prospective presidency.
Hard agree. If someone is hung up on a Biden/Harris ticket, they haven‚Äôt been paying attention these past four years. This election is deadly serious. It‚Äôs not hyperbole to say he‚Äôs destroying everything he touches.
Agreed, I just contend that when discussing candidates/policies, it‚Äôs imperative that we distinguish (A) ways Biden/Dems = less bad than Trump/GOP (‚Äúnot getting worse‚Äù) FROM (B) ways Biden/Dems/progressives will actually [materially] improve upon the status quo (‚Äúgetting better‚Äù)
Yes. Joe Biden supporters are corny weirdos that worship CNN.
I dislike the Clintons more than either Harris or Biden, and Harris IS better than Tim Kaine
Rather this cult then jumping on Biden‚Äôs lap. And making the hairs on his leg stand up.
I'm pretty sure  would poll at over 20% within a week of debating Biden and Trump. Her plan on criminal justice reform alone makes Biden's look like nothing more than an attempt to grab votes with no real change (oh wait, that's exactly what it is)
So yeah, Biden/Harris may not be the candidates I'm in love with, but I know who don't like, and I'll be using my vote to vote against Trump, who I believe is bringing the US closer to fascism every day.
I mean, the Biden/Harris administration will probably appoint people who are *not* actively out to destroy portions of the government, including the EPA, Dept of Education, CDC, USPS, etc...
Which brings me to Biden/Harris... people are bitching about them already, but like... They may not be your first choice, but I guarantee they are better than Trump and better than a flaming bag of dog shit...
Desperation from desperate people. Trump will lose. And your little tweets won‚Äôt gain new supporters. Update your resume. Joe Biden is a decent man. Trump is not.

DNC Secretary Jason Rae will call the roll of states on Tuesday as Democrats formally nominate Joe Biden for president.
But the American left is far from Communist, and Biden and the DNC are far from being the Social Democratic Party. Are they instead the Centre Party, who had "serious concerns" about the Enabling Act and yet universally voted for it as the final nail in the republic's coffin?
the lesser of two evils for conservatives this year isn‚Äôt trump and Biden its trump and abortion  Is abortion so evil that it warrants voting for someone you consider a bad person because, at the least, he won‚Äôt vocally/financially support/prolong abortion?  Personally, yea
In contrast, Biden in past debates has used the technique to talk directly to the center camera to the viewing audience. Will be interesting.
that would be participating in an election campaign, so it's not a good idea. Biden and Harris can consult with him later in November after winning
This is the same GOP the DNC is throwing Biden at thinking it will be okay in the long term.

because the convention is being shaped around who Biden is and what his strategies are, and that's mostly about playing to the white suburbs for normalcy
Bernie can't do that but Biden can, and he has done literally nothing to flip us to his side.
I think the likely outcome is around the D+8 we got in 2018. There's absolutely nothing Trump has done since that would really improve that score, and they can't seem to make Biden hated enough to drive his numbers down.
Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‚Äòshould be a great concern to all Christians‚Äô
Considering Hillary won 54% of the heads-up vote in 2016, it seems really bad strategy not to try to get some of those voters on your side. It's like Bernies strategy was "30% lane in a crowded field or bust"  It's also clear both Biden &amp; Bernie fans would prefer Liz to the other
Joe Biden pronounced it the same way yesterday with her six feet away from him!!!
Actually multiple sources have Liz's voters as 50/50 between Biden and Sanders. Some pragmatically moved to Biden on ST.  The reason I think Warren would do better vs Biden than Bernie did is b/c unlike Bernie, Warren received support from Hillary &amp; Bernie 2016 camps
Biden &amp; the Dem Party &amp; attendant Party goons have until November 2nd to get their shit together &amp; decide if they ACTUALLY care about beating Trump.  There are a LOT of voters out there they're flatly &amp; actively throwing away. Stop demanding--EARN their votes--OFFER something.

The only thing that will happen to Biden is him becoming the 46th president with the mighty Kamala Harris at his side. Pirro can drown herself in a liquor bottle for all I care.
I'm not excusing his racist post, but this is a lesson on how to apologize: "I want to make this very clear to everyone with absolutely no qualifications, I understand what I posted on social media was wrong, offensive and unbecoming."
Hope they're spying on John Kerry bc you know he's reaching out to his Iranian backers to promise things Biden will roll back.
This is what's happening now with you as president. We can do much better with Biden/Harris#2020
Everybody is saying things to the effect of:   "I didn't vote for either one. They weren't even in consideration for me."  Well, if no one voted for him, how the hell did we get stuck with Biden in the first place?

A Biden/Harris presidency would result in more abortions. If you truly believe that's worth beating Trump, you're not an evangelical, you're not religious, you're quite likely not even a good person.
This reminds me: I'm totally fine if you don't like Trump because he's not a conservative. That's fine. That said, there's no world in which I'd ever vote for a pro-abortion candidate like Biden because I want to "fix the republican party." It's never, ever worth it.

Exactly. A vote for Jo is a vote for Jo. I didn't realize how hard that is to understand. I guess her vote counts as 3. One for Jo, one for Biden, and one for Trump. Its a win-win.

Kamala Harris could serve 3 terms as President. If Biden wins it is obvious that he will step down immediately, if I were him I'd never be in room alone w/her...  She can run two terms after assuming the Presidency.   12 years.  The left would establish a tyranny. #EmperorHarris
Your reaching sorry you got joe name one that's  been proven in 4 years ! Your own vice presidential pick called sleepy joe out for his klan buddys.  Come on  sadly Biden has dementia
If Biden wins and steps down early in his term...#KamalaHarris is eligible to be President for TWO MORE TERMS. She could be President for 12 years.
And what exactly will she do about Biden's dementia his problem as a racist ,harassment of women or his sons ileagle dealings . Or her many skeleton's and misdeeds were not worried.
Hey, here‚Äôs an idea. Start pivoting toward Biden/Harris like you did Trump/Pence for the last election. Focus in the winners!   Right,  ??
Opinion: The DNC in Milwaukee still matters but Joe Biden must actually go to Wisconsin often during the campaign
Fuck Joe Biden
Either he's trolling, or he's trying to drag Biden across the finish line on his back.

Holy cow! You don't really believe this ridiculous drivel, do you? Biden is a Racist and Kamala is a Cop! They don't reflect me or anyone I know. I've got roughly 3 million friends who feel the same way. You don't speak for "all the American people." #FullFashTicket #NeverBiden

This analogy is dumb.  Voters are always asked to compromise, surrender, wait.  Biden's out there actively refusing to support hugely popular stuff like M4A.  So is Trump an existential threat or not? The Dem party &amp; Biden's actions both suggest he's not. That's on THEM, not US.
Legit Biden has given up on getting the left on board and that has been shown after Kamala has been picked as a VP. That is going to be his downfall, mark my words .
I don't want Trump. But, right now, I don't want Biden, either. It is indeed a bad situation.  The Dem Party needs to remember who they allegedly represent. Right now, they treat everyday voters horribly--offering nothing while demanding their votes. I just can't support that.
Oh I am so looking forward to "holding Biden accountable" for... something and also "pushing him left" this is gonna be fun as hell

What Does Joe Biden‚Äôs Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
What Does Joe Biden‚Äôs Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
The onus, again, is not on ME. I reject your framing.   If Biden and the Dem party want my vote--if they really believe Trump is bad--they would take the initiative to secure as many voters as possible.   They're not. That's on THEM.
Again, that's not on me or any other voter.   If Biden wants those voters, he can offer them something. So far, he's actively, repeatedly refused to do so.  It's interesting to me that the candidates are never the ones to compromise, only the voters are told &amp; shamed to do so.
I could care less WHO the person is. If the POLICIES are there, and I have more than just lip service in that regard, I am open to considering them.  Biden has an atrocious record, however, and has shown no interest at ALL in wooing or working w/ actual progressives. So fuck him.
What Does Joe Biden‚Äôs Choice Of Kamala Harris For VP Mean For Wisconsin?
The Democratic establishment is clearly willing to risk it.   It's a solvable problem. I don't WANT to not vote for Biden, but he's provided me with no incentive to do so.   If they think they can win w/o my vote, that, again, is on THEM, not me.
I can't imagine ever being open to Trump.  At the same time, Biden could TRY to match his policies to the wants of everyday people--you know, everyday working people the party USED to represent. And people--myself included--could be an EASY lock come Nov.   He's chosen... poorly.

Please go out and vote! Every vote can make a difference. If you don't agree with Biden/Harris you should look into voting for  Libertarian party. She's the best shot we got at getting Trump out of office.
What are you gonna do? Vote for Biden now, but withhold your vote when the Republicans throw another fascist at us against an incumbent Biden?  A. No you're not, you're gonna preach the same Blue No Matter Who crap, and B. if you threatened it anyways, they wouldn't believe you.
Fuck the polls.  We keep working like Trump is 10 points up.  No let up whatsoever.  Also I live in Wisconsin, and it sure doesn't feel here like Biden's 12 points up.  KEEP WORKING.
I thought I saw that the Marquette poll had Biden ahead, as well. I just hope that he at least mentions Milwaukee next week in his acceptance speech.

Hmm. In the whole history of USA there has been only one Catholic President and one Catholic Vice President. The live one is the 2020 Democratic Presdential nominee, Joe Biden.
He's been trying to be, which is why nobody on the left cares about him anymore. Bernie was our compromise. We tried twice, and the corporate dems have made it very clear they don't want or need the left. Biden is hoping to pull new votes from the right. Doesn't seem likely.

Biden is RIPPING apart Trump right now and it is fucking glorious.
Ridiculous but typical. You support the #WorstPresidentInHistory who can barley finish a sentence, can't read, so obese the WH has to Photoshop his pics in his fatass golf clothes with drool, sweat and hamberder stains...&amp; Biden is out riding a bike in between meetings.
Camel Harris will be the new President of the United States because Biden will never last!  Oh - and everything is Trump‚Äôs fault.
Biden and Harris are going to dominate here in WI  2016 was a huge fluke ‚úäüí•
Watching Biden on TV rn... I dunno about you, but this shit just got real.  is showing the fuck up, while Trump sits around and does squat‚ÄîI'm sorry, he's probably tweeting hateful things and complaining.

How long will it take you to realize a balanced budget amendment is a terrible economic idea, and admit you lied to 5th graders? I put my money on Biden.
We need polls of Biden, Trump, Kanye in states where Kanye has successfully made the ballot.  Maybe the GOP will stop helping him when they realize he takes just as many votes away from Trump as he does Biden.
while i'd love to see everythign pushed further left, it certainly takes the sails out of Trump's "Biden wants to defund the police" fear tactic.
If M4A is not actually popular among the electorate, showing this video will help Joe not Trump.  If M4A is popular among the electorate, pushing Biden to adopt it will help Biden not Trump.  What you're wondering does not make sense

This will 100% be described as a "Biden tax penalty" next spring by all Republicans and most media outlets in the event of a Democratic win in November, and McConnell will seek major concessions over it if he still controls the Senate

Biden/Harris2020 all the way!
Yeah I'll probably vote for her and Biden only because of this.
I don't think Biden wants to help Trump, he just has personal beliefs and institutional forces that push him to take positions that help Trump.

Reasons not to debate: They aren't debates. Trump will lie his ass off. If you spend all your time fact checking him, it becomes a big waste of time.  Reasons to debate: The Republican echo chamber wants us to think Trump is sharp and Biden is not. It's an opportunity to counter.

I was disappointed that Harris sold out the women she said she believed that Biden sexually assaulted for power. &amp; running alongside some1 she said worked with segregationists to try to stop busing. Now we have the person who passed the crime bill and the person who proscutd it.

And like I said...Biden is the lesser of two evils. We both want change, but the direction we're headed is not the way to do it in my opinion. Trump is corrupt too, but the good thing is he's brought it all to light. It was always there, to your point. It needs to be fixed.

You already know my stance on my preferred candidate, but I agree with you here mostly on Biden.   As for Kamala, I‚Äôm interested to hear your thoughts on her.
To get whose votes? What progressives were voting for Biden in the primary when he had a "progressive platform" so that he has to change it for the general?   Your logic is equivalent to slamming one's head on a desk.
I didn't vote for either Trump or Hitlary in 2016. I will not be voting for either Trump or Biden in November.
I don't understand this. You can't get what you want without Biden. Also Bernie has NO legislation to his name because he won't comp.
Joe Biden is a sleepy do-nothing-for-all Republican.
And without RCV or some similar voting system, they'll split the vote and hand the GOP the reins yet again.   Biden's stated platform is the most progressive platform of any Dem nominated candidate. As was Hillarys. Both moreso than Obama, who was the most progressive then.
If Trump's approval ratings are getting worse, why isn't Biden running away with it? Because dislike of Trump doesn't automatically translate to Biden support.  Trump gets 99% among the strongest Trump supporters, but Biden gets 92% among the most inveterate Trump haters, etc.

Joe Biden weighed numerous candidates for his number two spot, but only the Senator from California, it would seem, could be greeted with ‚Äúof course it‚Äôs Harris‚Äù upon selection.
Circling back to this, it is demonstrably false. The red dots are GOP.  1984 Joe Biden in 2020 would be called a conservative, most likely. But 1984 Biden was not a conservative in 1984. 2020 Biden would be off this chart completely to the left.

When prominent people try to get progressives on board by calling Biden and now Harris "the most progressive candidate in history", I just imagine some DNC suit handing them a bag of money.  Do you really think we'll think they're progressive just because you said so?
There's a lot of what if's to consider, but yeah, I agree with you there. You can look at 2nd choice polls and RCV results.  It's kinda clear that Warren was the 2nd favorite among 70-80% of Dem primary voters. All of Biden and Bernie voters would have preferred her to the other.
I mean, Biden was an "actual" Dem in the 1980s and wasn't a Reagan Dem. The record is right there.   Harris is the 2nd most liberal member of the senate, currently. She's sponsored some extremely progressive legislation.   It's easy to confuse her CJ background w/ policy stances.
Is that true though? Biden *won* that primary, but she still got a pretty big slice of the electorate.    Plenty of polls/RCVs have Warren voters evenly splitting between Bernie and Joe after she dropped out.
Kamala Harris has officially been chosen as Joe Biden's running mate.  Will she have an impact on how Wisconsin votes?   and  discussed.

Prolly time you to take a much needed civics class to learn how democracy works. You shld probably know that the majority is how people are elected. Biden has been in public service for longer than I have been alive-the Bros can't make the lies stick bc we already know who he is.
It is Obama‚Äôs pick, he‚Äôs got the feels for her. He‚Äôs got dirt on Biden, and withheld his endorsement until Joe agreed to pick her. Susan Rice will probably be in the cabinet, and Kamala will invoke the 25th Amendment in about a year, if elected.
Joe Biden was the Vice President of the United States. You‚Äôre bad at this.

Use your words, my friend. Tell me how photos w/out context put Biden on par with Trump‚Äôs misgivings.
Biden has a better chance of winning than Clinton. I would give him a 85% chance if the economic situation stays the same...if unemployment drops back to 4-5% before Nov, Biden will only have a 60% chance of winning...it was a bad decision not to go w a swing state gov (IMO)

9. When did  first become aware of how much Hunter Biden was being compensated by Burisma?
8. When did  first become aware that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
7. Was  aware in April 2014 that Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma?
4.Was Hunter Biden aware that British officials had seized the bank account of Burisma owner Mykoloa Zlochevsky?
3.Was  aware that Burisma‚Äôs owner, Mykoloa Zlochevsky, was generally viewed as a corrupt oligarch and that his London bank account containing $23 million had been seized by British officials only 15 days before Hunter Biden joined the board of a company he owned?
1.Why did  meet with Hunter‚Äôs friend and fellow Burisma board member Devon Archer at the White House on April 16, 2014? Was anything related to Ukraine, Hunter Biden, or Burisma discussed?
Even Secretary of State Kerry‚Äôs stepson knew Hunter‚Äôs involvement with Burisma was problematic, severing business ties with Hunter and making clear his reason why.
Two months after Ukraine‚Äôs Revolution of Dignity - a revolution against corruption - Hunter seized a multimillion-dollar opportunity available to him because his last name was Biden.
Biden already turned down the Green Deal outright.  Biden pushed through the Crime Bill that helped incarcerate millions of black Americans  on petty drug crimes.  Biden picked a VP that refused to go after corrupt wealthy individuals while backing for profit prisons.
The only substantial difference between Biden and Trump is Trump tear gassed American citizens for a photo op.  Biden not dumb enough to that.  That is the only reason Biden will win Wisconsin.
Great ?, took courage to get where you are. It would be great if all groups had representation in America,but they don‚Äôt.Third parties don‚Äôt work.Until we have a proportional system,where power can be shared among multiple parties:only 2 choices &amp; you won‚Äôt vote Trump, so Biden..
Vote for Biden.  This isn't a hard question.
Yes Biden says that he will mammary the mask for 3 months.  That's til election day?  Will all the scare tactics the left is forcing down our throats go away? Suppose so
That's bullshit to say to Biden, making threats like that. Lock her up with Trump
So, you're saying if we elect Biden and Harris, high-paying technology jobs will be available across the entire country?   Sure, there will be some growing pains, but I think a lot people will enjoy making a living wage.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this negro gal that keeps following me around?‚Äù  -Joe Biden, probably.
How do we hold Biden accountable if he doesn't address corruption, property, police brutality?  Do we vote Republican 2024 if he fails to produce?
I'd like to see it be #Preet Bharara. I think he'd be a great Attorney general in the Biden Admin.
This is my response to anyone that says ‚Äúthis election is too important to not vote for Biden/Trump‚Äù. Shit rolls downhill. You magically think 2024 that a 1960 JFK/1980 Reagan type candidate is going to magically materialize?
I have a hard time with people that don't think it'd be easier to push Biden &amp; Harris further left than risking 4 more years of Trump.
Trump‚Äôs the worst you‚Äôve ever seen so Harris is right there since she accepted campaign money from him. I love how convinced you are Biden/Harris will be radically different when Harris has Trump money in her campaign coffers. It‚Äôs cute
I would‚Äôve thought ‚Äúbut this election is too important‚Äù people would‚Äôve learned their lesson that candidates won‚Äôt get any better if you keep voting for terrible candidates after going from Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden but apparently not
Harris won't help Biden.  She doesn't have much political experience; she's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.  Biden was already going to win California.
If Biden wins (which I hope won't happen), who should be in his cabinet?  I hope, for these jobs, he'll chose these people:  sec. of state, Leon Panneta; sec. of treas., Janet Napolitano; sec. of def., Ken Salazar.

I like VP Harris Biden and Harris are going to make an awesome President and Vice President
The ‚Äúfeud‚Äù between Harris and Biden during debate season? On the opening day of the 1960 Democratic convention, LBJ sent John Connolly before the press to disclose the JFK had Addison‚Äôs Disease. Three days later, JFK invited LBJ onto the ticket. It‚Äôs politics.
When MAGA folks say Biden will ruin america:
Apparently you seem to forget that this woman locks up marijuana users and has laughed about it. Now, why would you wanna vote for someone that said Biden was a racist/believed the accusers and locks up people that clearly would be potential voters to get her In?
The only reason I didn't think she'd be the VP pick was it didn't help electorally, she's a Senator from California, Biden is probably going to get a large % of the vote there. But I couldn't think of a better alternative with national appeal.
And called Joe Biden a racist üòÇ makes a lot of sense...
Will Harris help Biden?  I don't think so.  She's in her first term.  She's not from a swing state.
Grow up and vote Biden
Is that to say we'd be Biden our time?
BIDEN/HARRIS FOR THE WIN!!!!
If Biden wins she will most likely become president because he ain't gonna last long
She'll either be the first female president if Biden is elected and resigns... or she'll be the presidential nominee if Biden even makes it to the election.
Congratulations  and  Excellent news!
As a Federal Democratic Republic not possible.The more I watch Orb√°n;Brexit perhaps our Founders prescient &amp; brilliant.The ACA despite its problems,has demonstrated to most that healthcare is a right.Biden will have an opportunity to bring a M4A like system,if he takes a chance.
I feel as if you would say that about anyone that Biden picked though
Of course Biden had to chose a non-white non-male VP. They would‚Äôve mopped the floor with him if he chose someone else. Why are we surprised it‚Äôs Kamala?  #VPPick Also, I kinda like her tbh.
Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American person on a major party's presidential ticket

Agreed. I still think Biden should announce the pick. He is really dragging this out.
Show me where Biden said he wants to ‚Äúend‚Äù SS. Wishing to reform it does not mean ending it. Trump cutting off SS funding ends it. What a cult you belong to.
I completely agree. I would never do that but I must confess that I don't miss his signs. It is amusing cause I would not have multiple Biden signs and flags in my yard if he had not come out strong with 6 Trump signs.
Sadly, this is where we are. I have multiple Biden signs in my yard and it was necessary to install cameras and motion sensor spotlights due to multiple vandalism incidents. Neighbor is a Trump supporter and he had 6 signs, all were vandalized. Now he has none. It's not cool!
For the love of God people vote Biden! #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Won't need them because Biden won't make it to election day. The delay in VP pick is really who will take Biden's place.
Let's not forget he's complicit in Trump's nonsense mission to 'investigate' Hunter Biden using Russian misinformation. Allegedly.
What if Biden's delay in picking a VP runningmate is really him picking a replacement for himself?  #deepthought
Biden already said he doesn't support the green deal and nether does Pelosi.
I think that about 90 percent of people, I know, will vote against Biden, but Illinois has a lot of Democrats.  In 2018, JB got 53 percent.  In 2016, Hillary got about 55 percent, there.  Duckworth got almost that percentage.
I can't believe these people in this country can be so stupid and ignorant we will vote Biden!
If you live in Illinois, please answer this.  Will you vote for Trump, or will you at least consider voting for a third-party candidate, since Biden will easily win Illinois?
New prediction.  Biden won't make it to the election. Dems will either install Sanders or appoint a different nominee.  #prediction #Election2020
7/7 The only ones responsible for furthering Russian disinformation to interfere in our election are the Democrats in Congress and the Biden campaign, and the media that is willingly amplifying their lies. They should all be ashamed.
Biden has also been a liar and plagiariser his whole life.
Your ignorant, divisive tweets aimed at rallying your ‚Äúbase‚Äù make me sick and galvanize my vote for Joe Biden this fall. Keep on tweeting things like ChinaVirus because it‚Äôs driving people like me (and there are many of us) who have voted Republican for many years, away.
Several sources say Biden will wait until November 2nd to tell us who he's chosen.
I can't say how much I agree with this.  Anything other than a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  He is far from my favorite and primary his ass out in 2024 but voting for him is a vote to start fixing this dumb shit.
IMHO not necessarily bad to ‚Äúrush‚Äù innovation, but science requires time. Speaking with friends, Nov/Dec 2020 simply isn‚Äôt enough time.  I will trust a Biden administration and Fauci. This of course moves any vaccine into February 2021 at the earliest.....
Disastrous or slow?  1) got results 2) no fraud  So what‚Äôs your complaint? 1) Waiting weeks to know the margin Trump lost to Biden  2) no fraud
How many porn stars did Biden pay off?
F this noise. Isn't it enough that voters all but capitulated and gave them Biden, when we could have had Warren or Sanders - actual progressives.  Now they want to hold the VP pick hostage? If they aren't ready to vote against Trump by now they never were going to.
Oh the left is letting him know how little appeal, support, or trust they have in Biden.
Hi Thom, Why does it seem like Biden is dragging out the VP pick? Maybe it always takes this long but all the speculation and waiting has become a bit annoying.
Horror thought...  If Biden drops out before accepting the nomination (or even before the election), do we get Bernie by default? üò±lmao... ur so woke... first of all its been debunked and fake or else he wouldve been removed by now... second of all you do know russias economy is like the size of texas? and yet chinas economy who prefers joe biden is double that of the usa
I mean, Kamala did say that Joe Biden was a bad guy... duh.
Second fact check in a week from a claim friends or family pointed out. Always welcome suggestions!   Biden opposes school vouchers, but he has no authority to ban them since the Wisconsin program is authorized and funded by the state.
takes more questions in one day than Biden has in a year. Plus you can actually understand him.
is not in control. He does what his handlers tell him to do. He is an old mindless puppet like Biden. His job is to disrupt, destroy, and slow any growth and prosperity in WI and the US to lay the groundwork to have Trump lose and have the country changed to socialism.
So when will Biden ever answer questions?
Actually biden has said many times that his tax increases will be for those earning more then 400,000 a year
Fuck this guy. So worried about 0.0000something percent fraud. I‚Äôm excited to watch how he reacts to his loss. Shame it has to be Biden to do it.
Joe Biden can barely read from his notes.  His handlers proposed this not him.
Blah blah blah, Vote BIDEN/HARRIS, return sanity to the White House.  Remove these cheaters, grifters, liars, and scum
Folks want to be outraged. Let's remember who helped Biden get this far. What did she do in the process?
While shopping, I thought of what the Biden Transition Team will need most. This jumps to the top of the list.
All Biden and Harris do is bash the President. Why? They are hiding their radical agenda from America. Why do the think the Senate bartender only gets 60 seconds at the DNC? ü§î

Honestly pissed that the 'progressive' Democratic party continues to push candidates that nobody wants, knowing we're forced to vote for whoever they put forth in order to vote out Trump. We didn't want Biden.
nobody likes Joe Biden and if you say you do you're pretending
And Biden wouldn‚Äôt be the nominee to go against him. His entire career is indistinguishable from a Republican‚Äôs. He won‚Äôt change anything, he‚Äôll just be polite on Twitter. It‚Äôs really disheartening that this is where we‚Äôre at now.

I am voting for Biden no matter what.
The Biden VP announcement timeline feels like the opening segment on Maddow. Taking forever to get to the damn point.
Joe Biden didn‚Äôt write this.
These are Biden supporters that are allowing this to happen. Why doesn‚Äôt he speak out about these governors allowing this but he won‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt care about the citizens only the money and power. Why would any one vote for a democrat for anything ever? This is pathetic!
Good to see Biden‚Äôs wife is doing all the interviews now. What a joke.
It's fucking annoying. Trump bad this. Trump good that. Biden bad this. Biden good that. I wanna blow my ears out during every video I watch (like FusionZGamer, Ben Phillips, IAMWILDCAT, etc). BUT at least they getting money off of it so yeah.
Yeah but I thought Trump was a better candidate in 2016. No way Biden is as polarizing as Hillary. He won‚Äôt have that sizable advantage this time around. Oh and now he‚Äôs running as an impeached incumbent. That seems...tarnished, to say the least.
And who is going to be blamed over the deficit? The republicans will blame Biden and the Democrats when they win in November. The Dems will get it under control and then a republican will be re-elected and there goes the deficit again. Same old same old.

Are there any 'journalists' at that presser able to ask a hard, inciteful question? Or, are they all ringers there to lob softballs.  Trump keeps referring to Biden et al as people who don't know what they're doing.  Pot calling the kettle black? Some COVID update. Such BS.

So 4% Republicans favor Biden?
I think it should‚Äôve been Rice. I think that would‚Äôve been the right one for Biden. Imo Kamala has way more negatives than Rice
She did poorly, but so did Biden in those same primaries. The first several states are not our nations demographics
I can‚Äôt say how bad of a pick Kamala pick is for Biden.
Hirsi Ali tells Tucker, even if unintentional, Biden by quoting parts of the Koran that radicals use as a reason for their terror, he is showing support for Sharia Law in the US.
Trump exposed everything wrong with the media, the left, and of course our government, voting for Biden would just be voting for the establishment to take back power, don't let them.  Look at how every Democrat city is being run right now, I don't want that.

Terrific ad, TOTALLY PROMOTES TRUMP'S VISION OF NO HOPE, DESPAIR, SICKNESS, AND POVERTY  Drain the GOP swamp!! #BlueWave2020  SO GLADE WE HAVE LIGHT, HOPE, WISDOM AND PROSPERITY WITH JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS!!
#KamalaHarris is Biden's VP pick, and state politicians and WI voters had their thoughts to share. Check out tonight's story:
You‚Äôre so classy. I was rooting for you. I love Kamala, too. Honestly, many whip smart &amp; strong candidates but you, Bass &amp; Harris were my favs for your work in the senate and beyond. Voting blue and proud of the Biden campaign for this historic decision. You‚Äôll be in the cabinet!
Six months from now, everyone complaining about Kamala Harris being a cop and saying they won't vote for Biden, and thus Biden losing, are going to be complaining about the third straight week of police officers shooting BLM protesters and Trump rooting them on.
He'll sign a bill if it comes to his desk if the pressure is kept up.  No matter what you say, Biden is better than Trump.  Four more years of Trump, we might not even HAVE A chance to vote for president.
Then please hold your nose and vote Biden. Fesh was right, there's two options in our system. The Greens nominated Trump no matter what name appears on the ballot for them.
Mike, Colorado is in play. Every vote for Biden counts. Do you really want to see four more years of Trump?
Trump would have been shooting protesters in the streets if he wasn't running for reelection.  Just admit it, you wouldn't have been happy no matter who he picked.  I'm not happy with Biden but he's not Trump. That's good enough for me this go around.
Are you kidding? Nominee Biden has pushed significantly left of Candidate Biden. He's taken big cues from both Warren and Sanders since they dropped out. There are so many bad narratives floating around that just aren't factual.
I saw ppl on twitter today who‚Äôre Anti-trump but don‚Äôt want Biden either, so they‚Äôre going to write in Bernie. Plz don‚Äôt be a fucking idiot. This is how Trump can get elected again. If you write in a candidate just throw away your fuckin ballot.
It‚Äôs starting to become clear why Harris was chosen...as Biden‚Äôs surrogate backbone.
I dunno. Maybe I'm an idiot for thinking the worst of Joe Biden is far better than the best possible Trump second term.  I understand not pushing it too far on policy in this election. You have four years to push on that if you win. What've you got if you lose?
Anyone who isn't in a state that's in play who doesn't vote for Biden is selfish.
There's two choices on every ballot.  Trump or Biden.  Sorry but every other party nominated Trump.  Don't vote? Grab yourself a MAGAt hat because you've owned it.  We have a better chance of progress with Biden than we ever will have with Trump.
With Biden in office though, we'll have a hell of a lot better chance of the action on the streets resulting in concrete positive, and lasting impact than under Trump.
It's also just kind of the reality of the moment. Like, I'm not prepared to fuck around with anything which might push the needle towards Trump this year. Get Biden elected, /then/ push him hard to be better.
I don't even like Biden, but I'm also never going to pretend for a second that I'm even remotely considering not voting for him.
Biden / Harris 2020 great pic ... vote in November, let‚Äôs remove this crime family from the people‚Äôs house!
It just bugs me when I see people on the left talking down about Biden constantly, like it's helping anybody. It's big Jill Stein energy and I hate it.
Biden could have picked Shank Hall as his running mate and I would still vote for him. #DumpTrump2020
Also I hope that when Biden and Harris win.. It's extra hard on you..
Nothing will make me more immediately suspicious of a person than them pretending like choosing between Biden and Trump is hard.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are known to be orange stain removers... And our democracy has had a huge orange stain that definitely needs removing

There's gonna be a lot more red hats come November 4th.  Frankly, I'm of the opinion if someone refuses to vote for Biden, they're no better than the most vocal MAGAts.  We have a chance to STOP Trump and undo his shit, which needs done before we can start progressing.
I didn't want Biden, and I've seen a lot of bad things about Harris.  Yet, since the choice is Biden or a narcissistic scumbag who's made our country a laughingstock, I'm voting for Biden.  America cannot survive four more years of Trump.
It is not Trump versus Biden. It is Trump versus Harris.
Only if people are more okay with four more years (at least) of Trump's crap than of voting for a flawed candidate who ISN'T a narcissistic POS.  There's two options, Biden-Harris or Trump-Pence. Vote Green? Trump's their candidate. Vote Socialist? They nominated Trump too.
When exactly did JB go from Justin Bieber to Joe Biden
I know some of you weren't going to be happy unless the VP announcement was "Biden picks Sanders, drops out moments later," so maybe settle down and focus on reacting from a healthier place, or don't react at all.
Let's face it, the only person Biden could have chosen that is going to satisfy the Bernie or Busters is Bernie himself.  I expect endless "Harris is a cop" for the next four years, regardless of who wins thebelection.

oh yeah, i just meant tried to change how the public sees her. i don't trust people that change their views like that and i don't trust her. don't trust biden either. i hate that i'm in a position where voting for them is a necessity.
Harris is super qualified, a woman, a minority, and basically shoots down the whole "the left is against the existence of police" thing the GOP wants to use. And she &amp; Biden will have the most liberal Democratic platform seen in several decades.

The red hats will portray Biden/Harris as basically communist.  The Bernie Bros. will portray Biden/Harris as basically pre-Trump Republican.  If you want to understand why even people of good faith struggle to understand where America is right now politically, start right there.

100%. Neither Biden nor Bernie was my first, or 27th choice. But I would rather vote for either than to have Trump just completely nazionalise (not a typo) our judiciary and send us back to 1870s.

I don't care for fundamentals. A lot of people believe this is what drives the market.   SO what could happen here in the USA that would for weeks continuously drive the market down?   A Trump loss to Biden and or the death of a President in Office.
I once believed that things were going well under Trump, and who came after would be a problem for our Nation.   I believed Trump would die in office. Enter Pandemic I don't believe Trump will be reelected. I don't believe Biden will make it thru his first term.
I'm one of those people with views on both sides of the table, so I do have issues with a Biden Presidency.   I appreciate the adult conversation.

People like to think that all their blood, sweat, and tears, from middle school through Ivy League law school and federal clerkships, were truly necessary to reach the top. Biden doesn‚Äôt belong unless he made the same sacrifices lest it threaten that fact‚Äôs veracity.

So you do think that Biden is a stalking horse for communism? Joseph Robinette Biden Jr., that Joe Biden?
Give it up, Biden is going to win
Man, I'm hardly the first one to say it, but how I wish that we lived in the world of Republican imagination. In that world, Bernie Sanders is a Marxist and AOC somehow controls Pelosi, while Biden is actually a stalking horse for communism.
Even liberals seem willing to admit electing down ballot Dems isn‚Äôt going to stop trump which seems to posit that democrats as a whole suck lots of ass. Nobody is like ‚Äúif you won‚Äôt vote Biden make sure to flip the house and senate‚Äù they‚Äôre like ‚Äúeat shit vote trump fuck you‚Äù
But you have hit on a key point, as a I noted elsewhere in this thread. Our country's political system is such a failure that it saw fit to offer us Clinton v Trump four years ago, and Biden v Trump today.   At least Bernie vs Rick Santorum would've been interesting.
Biden's not a pathological liar; I used that term advisedly, rather than hyperbolically. Trump is congenitally incapable of telling the truth, when a lie will do. Look at his interview with Wallace, in which he made up that horseshit about the MOCA and how amazed his MDs were.
I‚Äôm all for Biden for the reasons you‚Äôve described, but I‚Äôm concerned for chances to move forward when this is how progressives are seen by the party.
The rest is of this thread is not helping my case on blanket stamenets and twitter vs reality here.   I think there‚Äôs a middle ground between blind vote and pointing out obvious flaws. There does need to be accountability. Biden isn‚Äôt great but he‚Äôs not bad.
Joe Biden is pulling a Hillary and dodging Wisconsin entirely, refusing to accept the party's nomination in Milwaukee, so naturally President Trump is taking full advantage of the absence. üòé
Trump is a racist because of all the things he says and does. Joe Biden is also a racist, but he's not as bad as Trump because he isn't also a career criminal, a pathological liar, or a man completely ignorant of the important issues of the day.
Did you reach out to anyone in the  like  or  - you know, the actual left - for their view on Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? Or just Democrats?
I hate Biden, love this scenario.
If you are happily voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris you are NOT an ally I promise
Biden is a racist, after all, he opposed integration. But he's no where near as bad as Trump.  It's a huge indictment of our moribund political system that the choices we were offered in 2016 were Clinton and Trump, and the choices we're offered in 2020 are Biden and Trump.
I‚Äôm no Biden/Harris fan, but it clearly says what they are signing
Does it even matter? I never like anybody that I work with and it doesn‚Äôt alter our ability to get the job done because that‚Äôs what adults do. Obama and Biden were adults doing a job.
DO you ever stop talking and tweeting? It's like this constant diarrhea of the mouth.  God, I hope Biden wins just so you will just SHUT UP for a minute. Nobody believes a word you say, it's just BLAH BLAH BLAH all day every day.
I believe if Biden wins, his speech will focus on a return to the way things were in 2015 and restoring ‚Äòhonor to the Oval Office‚Äô. Also probably some lip service to making things a bit better for women and letting Kamala take it from there.

In contrast, Joe Biden has been married twice, and it's because his first wife was killed in a horrific car crash, along with one of his children. To the best of our knowledge, he never cheated on either woman.  His ideology sucks, but his personal ethics are miles better.
I'm the dork who fills out literally every single survey that Joe Biden's campaign sends to me, and though I'm fully aware they are all ploys to get me to donate, I am a lil heartened when they include questions about how the Democratic primary has impacted party unity
You don't think Joe Biden sucks? Or you don't think he's better than Trump?
Given how Obama and Biden literally did nothing while fascism happened in Central America and also brought slavery back to Libya I suggest you don‚Äôt advertise as antifa while championing a man largely responsible for installing fascism globally

As I said, your inane/patronizing comments while CLEARLY displaying you will not push Biden left is toxic to the effort of getting leftists.  You'd be better off just pulling the lever for Trump and being quiet as more than 2 leftists won't vote Biden because of you.
You are exactly the reason why I am so tempted to not vote Biden in a swing state. If you want Biden to win, you should probably not talk to leftists until after the election.  Otherwise you are just working to elect Trump.
Of course it's about race. Just like Joe Biden being against bussing was about race, being against low income housing is about race as well. You're smart enough to recognize that I'm sure.

A nationwide mandate is not an answer to anybody's problem. It's an exercise in government control, and the capacity for the American People to be sheep to their government. Some people should wear masks, others it's not necessary. Biden doesn't trust people to do the right thing

He has contributed millions to the DNC, 18 million I believe, and is donating to down ballot races. It was decided by all parties involved to not involve his media Team. But some, as individuals, moved over to Biden.
and as opposed to Biden et al, Obama was actually really good at politics. he could convince those to his left to give him more time and breathing space
I seriously think President Biden should make you part of his team in whatever capacity.

i love this piece! shout out to public universities! (especially the ones where i went to undergrad, grad school, and worked at, namely, UCSC, UW Seattle and UW-Madison)
the addendum here is that of course it's great and good and totally fine for people to try to influence biden/harris on policy, but a random DNC volunteer has as much poll as you do over the presidential platform, so you're wasting everyone's time trying to do it this way.

How about Trump‚Äôs racist comments about President Barack Obama?  Remember that?  Please educate me on the Biden racist comments please
Basically the difference between trump and Biden is do we want fascism used abroad only or fascism used at home as well. As you may have noticed from years of Obama Biden expanding illegal wars to little protest, exporting fascism makes the fascism more palatable and last longer

It wasn't going to being me in for sure.  Just saying Harris wasn't even the second or third most progressive Senator who ran in the primary that could have been picked.  Yet gaslighters are busy saying she is the most progressive ever and Biden is FDR.
I don't like her, but she'll do well in the debates and won't cost Biden the election. She is perceived as fairly moderate. As an ex-prosecutor she will hurt Trump's ability to claim the mantle as the law and order candidate. She was a politically expedient pick.

Yes, she has a problematic record as California's top cop. Biden has a more problematic record on a ton of things. I can't be overly concerned. I just want them to win.

Why would Jill Biden and fam let Joe accept the nomination for president given his mental decline - unless they knew he wouldn‚Äôt be serving as president after he gets elected?  Something is rotten in  the Dem party...
Joe Biden And Kamala Harris Host First Joint Campaign Event
So what you're saying is, they're secretly planning on Biden stepping aside. üòÇ
Joe Biden is literally running on the most progressive platform a party nominee has ever had, I get the apprehension with regards to his record but what he is saying now is a lot of what I want to hear. #BidenHarris2020
What I hope they do: 1) Announce they understand that Biden is better than Trump but refuse to vote shame anyone.  2) Announce that they are organizing a protest for January 20 &amp; 21 regardless of who wins.  If that happens, I'm all in.
This wasn't phrased like a normal VP pick would have been. Only one President has ever "stepped aside" and it wasn't exactly by choice...it's not something Presidents normally do.  "if and when Biden decides to step aside." ü§îü§îü§î  Source:
Joe Biden is a bait and switch victim
CNN already leaked the plan for Biden to step aside.
Just listened to Biden and Harris speeches, surprised myself by crying at hearing a promise of moral, caring leadership. I‚Äôm beyond tired of Trump and his enablers and their platform of power and money for themselves.
"More united than ever" in the sense that virtually all of the left will be voting for Biden to get Trump out of office. After this November, we may be looking at a different picture.
Would you mind telling that to Biden and Harris?
Not an isolated incident either.   Joe Biden is definitely banging his granddaughter.
Not an isolated incident either.
Mockingbird Media is openly planning for Biden to have a shorter presidency than William Henry Harrison.
"Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job" referring to ebola. 2 people died.  Trump pushed "miracle" drugs and said it would go away like a miracle.  There's a reason it hit America worse than other advanced nations: Trump's failure to take it seriously from the start. #COVID
When Joe Biden says campaigns are a "family affair", he means it LITERALLY.
Biden speaks like a normal human. I think there's enough rational humans out there to see that.

Wahoo! For everyone that's excited about this #VPPick make sure you pledge to vote for the Biden-Harris ticket here ‚¨áÔ∏è
Worth noting w/  coming to Oshkosh Monday as Dems kick off their virtual national convention his last political rally in Wisconsin was the same night as the final prez primary debate before the Iowa caucus.  Expect talk of how he came to Wis, while Biden didn't.
I think the "conservative" here describes her as a safe VP choice for Biden that matches conventional wisdom not her political positions. People need to actually read the article.
In November, I will vote for the Biden/Harris ticket. I wish them success.(4/7)
I mean, obviously don't do that, Joe Biden.
Immediately after being sworn in, Joe Biden orders the military to gun down the entire Supreme Court, then appoints nine beautiful thirtysomething female justices of various ethnicities. "Clean slate," he grunts in a Rorschach voice.
I'm voting for Biden. But you can be damn sure I'll be voting 3rd party in 4 years because this "lesser of 2 evils" shit has got to end. I want to at least pick the lesser of THREE evils every election.
I saw an acquaintance say the other day that she was still undecided as to who to vote for in November. How is this even possible?  I figured either you vote for Biden or you just admit you're a racist piece of shit. There's really no "oh gee, I could be kind of racist"
Biden isn't going to do shit about climate change and that is going to kill way more people than Covid. We need someone who isn't beholden to corporate overlords.
Thanks man! I was on the fence about voting for Biden, but this really gave me the clarity to realize that I will not.
How about your guy put Biden on the spot by releasing his tax returns and agreeing to real-time fact-checking during the debate?
In a tweet that could preview their message, Biden tweeted Wednesday morning that if he and Harris win, "we're going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won't have a minute to waste."
lol. We want M4All and Green New Deal. Joe Biden is a corporate shill. So no, I won't 'fall in line'. Democrats offer me nothing.
Biden isnt going left but everyone else that works under him will
Obviously it doesn't change anything for me, but Biden's ability to hide over the last few months has certainly helped him. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to the primaries and will finally see him on display (likely getting walked by Trump).
If the Kennedy twerp unseats Markey, I hope Biden offers him a cabinet spot.
How Sen. Kamala Harris went from one of Joe Biden's harshest critics during the debates to his running mate.

good, if we declare Biden unfit for president, we can have a half way decent president!
is Nate Silver aware that this is the picture they went with?
Biden is white. Youre white. Leah's white. You're all dunces. My narrative is in tact.
Trump care about the rich and racist Biden care about the ignorant and dumb they both terrible but you have to pick the lesser of two evils again
Will Harris help or hurt? The Biden camp has had the magnifying glass out for months to study that question, and has apparently come up with its answer.  Read about how progressives are weighing the pros and cons of  VP pick
Also, if you paid any attention, Kamala ripped into Biden for his part actions during his time to his face during the debate. That's one reason why we were shown he has changed. He forgave her, agreed that he erred, and chose her as his running mate.
How many doors have you knocked for Biden? 0? Must be a trump supporter since you aren‚Äôt fighting for Biden. How many times have you hit the gun range to train to shoot fascists if they take to the street with guns and trump refuses to concede? Zero? Must be a trump supporter
I like this. She and Joe could host different experts to highlight what a Biden administration would look like.  Potential cabinet appointees, health experts, trade experts, school experts, environmental experts.  End each event with 2016 Trump voter who is now a Biden supporter.
Biden literally grabbed a pussy.  Don‚Äôt forget that!!!  Eventually everyone sees the light!  Congratulations.  It‚Äôs your time!!!
I feel like I can hear this A1 saying, " And Biden announced his VP? Sure. Fine. Whatever"
The senate couldn't pass Obamacare with 60 dems! Trump couldn't overturn it with his majority!  Rapid change is really, really hard to make in our legislative system ‚Äî¬†and one thing I am confident in is that Biden &amp; Harris are going to respect separation of powers.
If Trump wants to understand  why Wisconsin women will be voting for Vice President Biden and Democrats up and down the ticket, he should watch our Convention.
I am not at all comfortable counting Wisconsin in the Biden column. Not sure about the others, but gonna be close, for sure.
Tucker Carlson calls Biden-Harris the 'first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history' | Fox News
For when you come across a Republican desperately trying to convince voters that Joe Biden will somehow be worse for our country than Trump...
Honestly, a slow progression towards the destruction of our world isn‚Äôt preferable than a quick decent under trump. Things need tremendous attention right now and Biden is a bandaid to a fatal gun shot wound.
This is why Biden picked  Harris was widely expected to be the pick, so  had MONTHS to generate oppo talking points against her. This is the absolute best they have.  #Kamala
Who made racist and misogynistic social media posts in the past six hours?   Hint:  it wasn‚Äôt Biden.    You cannot trust Donald Trump.  He has already killed 160,000 Americans through incompetence. What happens when his hair trigger temper goes off when his hand is on the button?
And having a woman on the ticket gives Biden Bros a convenient scapegoat when they lose. ‚ÄúI guess some people aren‚Äôt ready to vote for a woman.‚Äù Blame the voters, not the candidate.
Joe Biden is Catholic *but even if he weren't* &amp; he worshipped a dried apple sculpture that won 3rd place at the State Fair he'd still be closer to Christian than Donald Trump (who gassed peaceful protesters to hold a photo op OUTSIDE a church, w/ a random, upside down Bible).
Ummm....isn't Biden Catholic...??
Oh, we‚Äôre talking about Biden. I thought we were talking about your candidate - who hides in an underground bunker and tweets everything from his VP pick to your eventual firing.
Translation: if you elect Joe Biden, black people will move into your neighborhood
This being said, I am actually gonna vote for Biden/Harris ü§°üò≠
Biden. Or Stacey.  Really.  ? Elvis.    Trump 2020.
Undoubtedly it will be a close race in the Electoral College, although Biden will win popular vote.  What I am unsure of is the underlying methodology of the polls averaged.  In 2016, we learned, they undercounted non-college whites.  Do the 2020 polls fix this skew?
I third this.  Just gotta our women in charge...which Biden isn‚Äôt afraid of! #BidenHarris2020
I want a tee shirt that say‚Äôs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a NASTY Woman‚Äù on the front and Biden/Harris in the back.
Everyone is joking about voting for kanye right? Like haha but we're all still voting for Biden/Harris
Allan Lichtman has predicted every president since 84 correctly and is going with Joe Biden.
Joe and Kamala are a great team!  It is unfortunate that they won‚Äôt attend tonight‚Äôs Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee to introduce Kamala as Biden‚Äôs VP pick to the rest of the country.  Joe and Kamala need to visit Wisconsin soon and not repeat Hillary‚Äôs 2016 mistake.
Biden is Catholic so Tobin is jeering in his tweet
I think this is a good day to donate to the Biden-Harris ticket!!!
Biden/Harris2020 - We‚Äôll have Planned Parenthood do it.
I think every week or so between now and the election, Biden should announce a new cabinet member.  - makes people think of him as already President - allows the media to contrast his picks with the garbage fires there now - let's start with Betsy DeVos
That's Clinton. I don't see anything to do with Biden or Harris. Nice try but you failed.
‚ÄúIf we lie to our model and tell it that the election is going to be held today. It spits out that Biden has a 93 percent chance of winning. In other words, a Trump victory would require a much bigger polling error than what we saw in 2016.‚Äù #StayFocused
The problem with this stand is that come January, we're all going to be eating the same dish, and "none of this" is not one of the options on the menu.  Bush v Kerry? Obama v McCain? Sure. We'd be okay either way.  Trump v Biden? I genuinely don't think so.
"Law-and-Order Baggage" ( ?!)
I haven‚Äôt read anything that has convinced me that Biden has raped anyone, so I don‚Äôt believe I am voting for a rapist. I do believe the writings of Timothy Snyder, Masha Gessen and Jason Stanley, which lead me to believe that if I want to live in a democracy T must be defeated.
The idea that Biden is beholden to the far left seems like desperate straining.
Like I'm just supposed to assume that he's implying Biden will be in a wheelchair
Here‚Äôs the thing.  Think of the election like a coin flip that‚Äôs weighted a tad towards Biden. (For now)  We aren‚Äôt flipping the coin 100 times.   It‚Äôs only being flipped 1 time. Trump could absolutely win this thing. To think otherwise is stupid.
A sober and objective accounting of Biden‚Äôs record as an elected official recognizes the unique responsibility he bears for our current moment. It‚Äôs not the left that‚Äôs confused by this!
Wow. The bishop of Providence, RI doesn't know that Joe Biden is Catholic.  But then he didn't think it was his job to report his diocesan priest sex abusers. Sad.

I don't like Kamala as Biden's VP candidate. I LOVE Kamala as the next Vice President of the United States. I'm a guy, and I am thrilled about this. At last, after almost four years of hell, a glimmer of hope!
This idea of Joe Biden as a "far left stooge" isn't sticking, because that's just not who Joe is; people can sense it even if they don't know him.  I think "Dementia Joe" will also fall away after the first debate.  What else do they have? Nothing.
Well see if u would of said this first instead of just Nah I would of said that ur one of the good ones lol. While we might disagree on Biden/Harris is better for the country we can agree on this

You can't say defund the police and also support Harris (and Biden). Stop making excuses for their Bullshit. Hold them accountable like you wanna hold Trump accountable.
Forces him to be better?  Really     I think Biden was perfectly fine yesterday, and will be perfectly fine tomorrow.  Such an insult to Biden &amp; in turn,     Or did Biden FORCE Obama to be better too?   This is why I don‚Äôt want you or your network.
I love this.  The same ppl who talk of how Kamala is so progressive are the same ones who said Biden is so moderate.    News Flash: They both are centrists.  Always have been.  Sorry to disappoint.    #BidenHarris2020
If I see a YesWeKam hashtag again i will literally ü§Æ  I love Kamala.  Nothing to do with her, but lets remember this is Joe Biden running for President.... hopefully for 8 years.  Not a Kamala Harris 2024 Campaign.   #BidenHarris2020
Spoiler: Doesn‚Äôt help or hurt.  People will vote based on Biden and Biden only.  A few outliers on Twitter might be the exception, but I agree.  I like her-always have-but I would vote Biden no matter who he chose.  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenVP

But if you truly know what Jesus was really like, he'd probably hold up a Biden/Harris sign.
Four debates. First Harris/Pence, second Biden/Pence, third Harris/Trump, fourth Biden/Trump
Kamala Harris is a transphobic cop haha vote for Biden still tho please
If it gets Trump out I‚Äôm ok. I also think Biden will be a 1 term President and We the People need to get busy organizing for the future! #GreenNewDeal
I spoke to the local  chapter about  joining the Biden ticket.   Pres. Greg Jones: ‚ÄúMore than anything else, this decision says this country can live up to it‚Äôs creed that all Americans are created equal.... Biden didn't forget the legacy of African Americans."
((JUST SO WE ARE CLEAR i am voting for biden because i don‚Äôt really have any other choice lol it is just sad that that‚Äôs the case and is hard to think about how different things could be...not to dwell on da past or anything but it‚Äôs tough to swallow sometimes))
I voted Warren in the primary. I bought a shirt. A NICE shirt. But Harris is the right pick for several reasons: 1) she sparred hard w/Biden in primaries and the choice says a lot 2) as a former AG she can cut through GOP legal bullshit, 3) wary abt two 70-somethings on a ticket.
I‚Äôve been waiting for this announcement to buy my Biden yard sign and bumper sticker. Might have gone overboard with a few other things
Yay! Great! Biden chooses a Veep nominee who is disliked by the Right AND the Left. Woo hoo. Thanks for four more years of Trump you idiot Corporate Dems.
For anyone who thinks your proving something by not voting for Biden, think again, esp if you aren‚Äôt personally busting your ass at lower levels of politics. A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for the acitivists working their asses off to push Dems  left. Read: #BidenHarris2020
Biden is 77 and has borderline dimentia. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have to wait until 2024
People can joke about Biden securing California but is there any data on whether a VPs home state effects winning said state? Like where the fuck was Tim Kaine from, and did Clinton win there???

If Biden had picked Trump as VP, it still would have been better.
That's why he's backing Biden and making me say to him,  "OK, Boomer."  Got it.
I'm already counting on Biden 4- Harris- 8...probably need that much time make a dent in the mess we are in
Can people discussing settling for Biden/ not voting for Biden explain to me who you think is going to win the presidency if it‚Äôs not Trump or Biden. I don‚Äôt like Biden but I‚Äôm genuinely curious as to why people think our electoral college system is going to allow anyone else
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's Vice Presidential pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at this evening's coronavirus press briefing. He said, "...we‚Äôll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
She was picked because Antifa/BLM (who run the Democrat Party) know they can walk all over her, and assert their insane will on the American People once she is in office (not like Biden will be there long)
Ummm, her exact quote began, "I will direct this at vice president Biden, I do not believe you are a racist..."  That is kind of the opposite smearing him as racist.  What a startling lack of knowledge, or manipulation of a message to get clicks.
(Biden beat Sanders 55-40 in Dane County in April but I'd guess Sanders did better within SD26.)
Three Madison wards in (70,73,77).  Roys/Nada well &gt; Biden/Sanders in all three.
Kamala will destroy Pence but Trump is gonna bully Biden bad in the debates #BidenHarris #TrumpFailedAmerica
Let's see...  Trump/Pence want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Biden/Harris want to arrest me for supporting antifa over oligarchy.  Decisions, decisions.
Bwahahahahahahahaha!!!  (This pick means that Biden wants to keep Mnuchin on as Secretary of Treasury.)
In all three polls, Trump earns largely negative reviews for his handling of the presidency.
Let's! I am for Biden &amp; Harris!
Look, if you can get close to Biden for a few minutes and tell a plotless story about growing up in central Pennsylvania, you're in.
Presumably because Biden has chosen his running mate, people on my TL are coming out of the woodwork to say that they'll watch the debates even though their minds are already made up.  Nobody's undecided this far into any presidential election cycle if they're paying attention.

I am SO glad Biden didn't pick Susan Rice.
Wisconsin Democrats applaud Joe Biden's selection of Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate while opponents call it a radical decision.

Harris pointedly let Mnuchin off the hook for his fraud during the mortgage crisis.   Does the pick mean Biden is planning on "turning the page" on Trump and letting them all off the hook if they win?  I think so.

That is fair. He certainly might. But I'll support a rock over Trump and I'll happily support Biden if it gets that monster out if office!

Democrats really just make the dumbest choices imaginable and it only works out for them because Republicans make choices too dumb to imagine. Everything about Biden's campaign is a surefire way to lose but Trump's out here doing the most to make him seem reasonable.

This country simply cannot survive four more years of Trump so I‚Äôll do the one thing that I can to make sure he isn‚Äôt re-elected and that is to vote for Biden and Harris.
Kamala Harris isn‚Äôt perfect and neither is Biden. My personal feelings, however, do no matter. This upcoming election matters too much to let personal feelings get in the way.
Remember when she said Joe Biden was racist? Awkward
He sees it. He whispered in Biden's ear as he slept that Kamala was the right choice. I'm sure he helped.
I wish people would stop casting Biden's Cabinet like they're casting the upcoming movie version of a popular book.
If you're upset that Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris just take solace in the fact that they're both going to hell when they die
It jamokes like this dude who allow the you to get watered down BS (like a dem ticket not supporting Medicare for all or cannabis legalization). So when Biden loses wisconsin, blame larry for not wanting to listen to any dissent.
Yeah was really great how she threw  into prison for unethical foreclosure practices at the same time never sending any POC there for drug charges.  Ironic that Biden picks a cop to be his running-mate in a time when we are discussing de-funding police.  ACAB.
The real press is covering Biden/Harris
The far left wing of the Party doesn‚Äôt need fuel. We knew Biden was a centrist-&amp; knew he would pick a centrist.  Nobody really thought Warren would get it, did they? Far left is as bad as far right-left of center is perfect. Happy the next Potus &amp; VP will be there w/the majority!
Biden Harris 2020! Twelve weeks to go, lets go win this thing!
This line of attack is amusing considering Biden is only four years older than Trump and in much, much better physical shape. And mental shape, because while yes Biden has a stutter and mangles his words from time to time, have you all been listening to the incoherent word...
Idem with Biden‚Äôs record on a number of things, like Obama‚Äôs immigration record
Look at  and  trying to get along so they can win an election. Alright now. Let's get this done. #Election2020
I wouldn't overset expectations.  Everyone thot Hillary would kill Trump and one time she didn't and it changed all perceptions of his capabilities.  Likewise, Biden actually flipped the script when all thot Ryan would out debate him.  Don't overset expectations.

Exactly! Vote Biden/ Harris, they undo the damage Trump did and start working towards Medicare For All, climate change, college affordability, etc. If Trump wins again, progressive reform is not happening
Biden also lost presidential primaries before *checks notes* being the vice president raised his profile
Meh. Biden kinda sucks and you're just along for the ride. I'm voting for Biden because it's really the only choice. Don't fuck it up
Biden has been the only one to mention a plan to try and fix the divide in America between races. Donald Trump has only stood up for one race. The white population.
