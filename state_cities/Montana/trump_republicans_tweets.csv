July 25 Trump signed PPP HCE Act that appropriated $25 BILLION for testing.  How much of those funds have been obligated? To whom and for what? How much remains unobligated, and why? Is any Congressional Committee providing effective oversight? Or just more lies and incompetence?
Truly abhorrent.  Trump, Kushner, Pence and many more are ALL responsible for thousands of deaths.

Trump Can‚Äôt Delay the Election‚ÄîSo He‚Äôs Trying to Make It a Chaotic Mess
Trump is injecting trillions in newly minted dollars into donor class holdings.  Where does the bulk of that money come from?    Taxing America's working poor and middle class assets.

What Could Happen If Donald Trump Rejects Electoral Defeat? | The New Yorker
Constitutionally Trump's term ends at noon on Jan 20, 2021. What happens depends on a lot of other factors. Are congressional elections also prevented? The guys at  covered this about a month ago. Simply put, it's complicated.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.

Hicks, Spencer, and Preibus were all called back to DC.  Ostensibly for the campaign, but more likely because Trump felt that he owed them the treatment in exchange for their continued silence.

Most presidents fight homelessness.  Trump fights the homeless.  It's an interesting strategy as foreclosure and eviction crises loom.

Whatever anyone thinks of Hillary Clinton, we wouldn‚Äôt be experiencing most of this shitshow with her as president and in charge of the executive agencies.  Trump is so fucking insane that you can make an agency-only argument for Biden.  Truly crazy times.

But he failed. Montanans - that red state - did the weird thing, the unexpected thing, or maybe *the thing we always do*. We voted with our consciences. We voted for Senator Tester. And I won my district (that had voted for President Trump +11 points) by 39 votes.
I thought I was screwed. And worse, I thought Sen Tester was, too. Trump came to Montana 4 times in an attempt to sway us to vote against Senator Tester. It was an unprecedented (and possibly illegal) use of the bully pulpit of the presidency on such a small population.
I remember this bc I was canvassing in the same neighborhood, and I was convinced that Trump being here meant I was going to lose. Here was THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES in my little neighborhood of 10,00 people, shouting at my voters (who had voted Republican before!).

The GOP started weaponizing coronavirus against the American People almost immediately.  It is as if they had a ground game to do the wrong thing always.  Yet for some reason Trump isn't afraid.  To have a vaccine for a novel virus, you must have the virus first.
President Donald Trump in recent days suddenly acknowledged the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic. Here's a review of some of his statements on that and more from the past week.
Biden does not have this on the bag. You kinda sound like you think that's the case - like people did in 2016. Trump was an ass then &amp; he's an ass now. Biden has already abandoned the 50-state strategy (like Hillary.) I fear I'm seeing 2016 again, but that's just me. #vigilance

Trump's America is riddled with disease, economic collapse, markets untethered from production and corruption fed by tax stolen from the working class.  He's like a reverse Robin Hood that steals from the poor to give to the rich.
The rules are to wear a mask if you aren't going to socially distance, right?  Almost everyone in your video was wearing a mask.   Interesting choice of videos, given that there are plenty of other crowds of people to scold, like gee I don't know Donald Trump's Tulsa rally?

Doing this is stupid. It's playing into Trump's hands. Or there's instigators in their midst. That happened in the sixties all the time.
Yeah I mean, certainly a lot of people continue to work hard to add union members. It‚Äôs just depressing when you see, like, building trades guys at the Trump White House
I just realized that no one is getting mad and saying, ‚ÄúWho cares about the politics of it,‚Äù these days.  Whether people want to admit it or not, they‚Äôre worried about Trump getting re-elected and aren‚Äôt going to completely blow off political concerns.  Which is good.
I was listening to a #NeverTrump‚Äôer podcast last night - because they‚Äôre the only ones who remain laser-focused on the politics - and one of them was saying we should expect a Trump rally at some point but it is getting late and at some point the numbers are fairly set.
She is! The best thing she can do is get rid of trump
If you haven‚Äôt done anything to defeat Donald Trump other than post on social media, I spent a year working in factories in rural Wisconsin and am definitely judging you.

We‚Äôre going to need more prosecutions after we defeat Trump.
Gonna celebrate my Marxism today by filling up my car with gasoline, shopping at Cabelas, and going bass fishing. Since I don‚Äôt care for Trump, that‚Äôs totally commie stuff now.
Every single one of Trump‚Äôs mercenary assholes need to be identified and prosecuted.
So why were so many trying so hard to debunk it? Could it be a blind hatred of trump? Did this blind hatred for Trump cause additional deaths??

Woah!  The estranged Republicans sound like they‚Äôre open to wholesale reform of DHS after how Trump has been using the agency against protesters.

Here we go... BBC News - Donald Trump suggests delay to 2020 US presidential election
It‚Äôs funny because republicans love calling gen z ‚Äúliberal sheeps‚Äù but yet, if trump told them drinking bleach would cure corona virus, they would do it with no questions asked.
But thank gawd a couple private jet firms, who's founders were Trump donors, got $47 million!  Good of you to look at the big picture!!
Yes, Trump Derangement Syndrome. Because anyone who dislikes a virus out of control, a collapsed economy, record debts, systemic racism, and wild corruption must be insane. Sane people like you love those things.
He died from COVID. He caught it at the Trump rally. He didn‚Äôt wear a mask. That‚Äôs why he died. Got it?
..150,000 Americans die horrible, painful deaths. We are in deepshit &amp;  put us there. Many more Americans WILL die, more families destroyed. Trump got his American Carnage &amp; he was going to make sure it happened one way or another when he said it. It's insane that USA ISNT...
...US military- SOLDIERS ARE SICK W/Covid! All deliberately for Putin. Trump's not stupid, senile, or naive -it's an act- he's diabolical &amp; he doesn't give a shit if USA is attacked by foreign powers as long as he's making $$, getting revenge &amp; power. It's obvious-he helped...
..its aTrumps marketing scheme to sell lies &amp; fear &amp; it works on #magamorons- they're the same people who buy "loses 50lbs &amp; 50 inches in 1 week eating all the donuts you want" weight loss plans. No harm done right? WRONG- Trump/GOP murdered 100,000 Americans, weakened exposed...
This is a lie.  The GOP brand is lying.    You are obstructing hundreds of bills.  Your focus is on the rich.  A$2 Billion FBI building to help Trump‚Äôs DC hotel?  Are you kidding!    SIT DOWN! #MoscowMitchMcConnell  #TrumpIsACriminal  #TrumpDeathToll152K

Looks like people are voting someone out but it isn't Trump! Doesn't sound like you are a very nice person which saddens me but also not hard to believe as you spew hate towards our president and his administration which supposedly goes against your choose love campaign.

NOTE: The same libs that are blaming Pres Trump for Herman Cain's death, are the same libs DEFENDING Gov Cuomo from sending C19+ patients into Nursing Homes &amp; causing the death of 6700 susceptible elderly people!  #DoubleStandards #LiberalHypocrisy #KillerCuomo #hypocrisy
No apology from Trump for his Tulsa rally that Herman Cain was dumb enough to attend.
Absolutely true. And so would millions of others. All the Iranians who ever gathered in a stadium to chant "Death to America" only wish they could rack up Trump's kill numbers.
The third-world tradition is to allow the dictator to escape to a neutral country with a nice chunk of the treasury. But it would be nice to see Trump intercepted at the border. Trying to climb over a wall, perhaps.
I will proudly vote for Trump! From Montana
Im so sick of all these politicians. Claiming to be for the people but y‚Äôall are just selfish assholes trying to keep your jobs. ‚ÄúTrump isn‚Äôt above the law‚Äù? Bullshit. Prove it. Someone needs to step up cuz none of this is ok. Dicks.
Trump was impeached for being dumb enough to believe  which has continued to publish trash.
Why is  lying about Trump‚Äôs fascism?
Trump is scared. #DictatorTrump  #TrumpDeathToll152K
Imagine thinking the idiot who died after going to Trump‚Äôs fascist Tulsa rally was a ‚Äúgreat man.‚Äù  These dumbasses are openly praising fatal stupidity, even after #FoxNews played a role in yet another death.   They simply refuse to take responsibility for their lies.
Imagine being so deranged as to ignore the fact COVID killed Herman Cain.  This is the same exact stupidity that resulted in Cain attending Trump‚Äôs rally for fascism in Tulsa.   These nuts are verifiably delusional.
On July 14, 2020, President Trump signed into law an Executive Order that ends Hong Kong‚Äôs differential treatment compared to China.

About 5 weeks after attending Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally.
Fear is the mindkiller. It's funny, my brother and I were talking recently about the Trump/Harkonnen parallels. He thought Trump wasn't devious enough, I said he didn't have to be.
His diagnosis came less than two weeks after he attended Trump‚Äôs campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, tweeted a photo of himself without a mask at the event, which was attended by several thousand people.
Herman Cain will be remembered as a dumbass ‚Äî he never should‚Äôve gone to Trump‚Äôs fascism rally in Tulsa.  Stupidity can be a fatal disease.
What is Trump afraid of? Voters.
Due to Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, actions, lies and bullying, the country may be more divided now than since the Civil War.
Last month, Cain had tested positive for COVID-19, just a little over a week after he had attended a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20.
How close was Abbott to Trump?
Trump's totalitarian buddies in Russia and China have already tinkered their laws to make themselves kings. You can't expect a man like Donald not to at least make the attempt. #DeathToDemocracy #DeathToAmerica #Trump2020
What an interesting attempt to distract people from the #FACT that Donald Trump is proposing an illegal coup to keep himself in power just as his totalitarian friends in Russia and China have already done. #TREASON
Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
No one: Still no one: Trump: I hate poor people. Also Trump: All Lives Matter
Any person who thinks that Trump will NOT immediately refute the election results is living a pipe dream
No way asshole.

The economy directly effects  hospitality &amp; tourism. That's a plain fact. Don't believe me, feel free to ask anyone in the biz how their numbers compare to previous years. Then ask them how their restaurant or hotel performed under Clinton &amp; Obama vs Bush &amp; Trump.

As if a lily ass whimp bitch cuck like Donald Trump ever had the testosterone levels at any point in his life to stand up to a Bond villain like Putin and call him out on his placing bounties on American troops. What do you expect from the dude who had to buy a wife?
This isn‚Äôt about trump, this is about utilizing poor sources. Try again.
Pressed on why he didn‚Äôt raise the matter in Thursday‚Äôs call, he said: ‚ÄúThat was a phone call to discuss other things, and frankly that‚Äôs an issue that many people said was fake news.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know why? Because they didn‚Äôt think ‚Äî intelligence ‚Äî they didn‚Äôt think it was real,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt think it was worthy. If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk.
you must be so proud that Trump is the reason you are where you are today! congratulations "journalists"
Trump is so stupid he retweeted this article todayüòÇ He really doesn‚Äôt read anything, if he did he‚Äôd see wonderful statements like this
Well, the Trump spawn came from and grew up in some weird shit, we all know that from his nieces book. Just saying!
Its 10:16 PM in Moscow Night shift on Twitter on deck. Latest BS "Trump is the hardest on Russia than any other POTUS" ü§£ü§£ Today Trump says I talked to Putin about nuclear arms but no didnt say anything about the bounties you put on American soldiers - did I do a good job, boss?
I guess they just want Trump supporters to vote by mail.
Trump dismissed Democratic demands to include aid for cash-strapped cities in a new coronavirus relief package and lashed out at Republicans, saying they should ‚Äúgo back to school‚Äù if they reject money for a new FBI building in downtown Washington, D.C.

Much like a good treatment for aids is draino .... both is suicidal!!!! DONT TAKE THAT MEDICINE, and don‚Äôt use draino even if trump said too!
When is  going to connect the dots between animal agriculture, climate change and ecological disaster?   Put down that butter!!
So this is a douche bag of a guy but his crimes were mere child‚Äôs play compared to everyone trump is associated with know and is working for him. Yet this guy was charged and is in jail.
its lunacy how is Trump still in office? on thos effing planet?
Trump doesnt deserve to be any where near John Lewis- be glad  didn't pollute Mr. Lewis's space.

yee HAW #MAGA w/ Donald "nobody likes me wawa" Trump
Its 715 am in Moscow. Russian trolls coming on shift. Night shift is sparse these days- Putin has killed almost as many  Russians w/Covid as the number of Americans Trump/GOP has killed w/ COVID. Ain't that a stunning legacy  ?
by the way- why hasn't Barr arrested them &amp; stopped the violence? Despite millions of $$ of resources &amp; personnel, the rioting continues so either Trump/Barr are uttetly incompetent or they don't actually want to stop it, dont want their "antifa" identified. Of course you..
then theres this- but hey who's counting?- if you had to have proof of Trump denying constitutional rights to the American people then you obviously have no clue what the US constitution describes- heres a hint- most Americans learn thos in 9th grade civics- it's not that hard

It isn‚Äôt a temporary truce, that would imply that neither side would lose ground, unfortunately the data doesn‚Äôt support that assessment, the US has lost ‚Äúbigly‚Äù under Trump
And as trump said ‚Äú blacks are lazy‚Äù! It seems to me the #TrumpCrimeFamily and #PutinsGOP  are the lazy ones..... they only have one job and what they mostly do all day is tweet, complain, and rob America blind while sitting on their asses!
The narrow ‚Äúphase one‚Äù trade deal Trump announced in January did little more than lift some of the tariffs Trump had imposed on American importers in exchange for Chinese promises to purchase more American goods that will almost certainly never be fulfilled.
Not a single aspect of Sino-American relations has evolved favorably for the US. Bilateral trade deficit rose during Trump‚Äôs first two years and is now the same size as when Trump took office. U.S. goods exports to China have fallen every year since 2017.
More evidence that you  are a #Fascist           yes man attacking antifa i.e. a contraction of the word anti-fascist ....meaning you are a fascist actively against the anti fascist movement. Thus you are a fascist, serving the fascist trump for money.

Perfect for Trump. #TrumpIsAnIdiot

What happens if trump trys to do it 1st? maybe Democrats would fail.
wow, Nick you're a genius! now explain how Trump is NOT a fascist pig &amp; NOT denying Americans their constitutional rights, NOT defying principles of democracy prescribed in US constitution eg- 1,4th amend rights, NOT defying congressional oversight. You can't.
Yes!The thing I want, and will never get from Republicans is. I was wrong about Trump.He doesn‚Äôt fit my values.We‚Äôll need a truth and rec..
You're right. They're hard-core and they like what trump, Gianforte and others of this ilk do to the people they hate. They're just like the people they worship. They think they've never gotten what they deserve in life and it's always someone else's fault, not theirs.

Barr to Gaetz: Antifa "anarchic temperament so they don't get get along w/ each other" blah instill fear, lie, instill fear, lie some more. If Barr has something to prosecute "Antifa" then DO IT! He wont cuz he needs Antifa myth to continue using unfounded to campaign for Trump!
Interesting that Montana which Trump won by 20 and is about 7.9 and probably falling.  Bullock won in the 2016. This has to put pressure on all  candidates.  Especially Daines.  #mtpol #mtsen #mtgov
Right. Fortunately, those 65+ (who religiously vote) are not trending well for Trump because they don't want to die from Covid.
Because you are a Trump supporter. You've defended him this entire time. I haven't heard a single word of condemnation.
Oooof  Source:
Also because there are more registered Democrats than Republicans.  If voter turnout is 60% or above, it's over for Trump.
No way this fool is educated. Might be from Trump University.
Yep, and unequivocally that's not Trump. My vote against him will prevent him from ruining our country for another four years.
Twitter removed a tweet that had been retweeted by President Donald Trump that falsely said that there was a cure for the coronavirus.
I‚Äôm actually advocating for you to vote. Just opening your eyes that you‚Äôre okay with four more years of Trump.
TBH they probably would drive around the countryside raping and murdering for fun if they could.  So I am okay with this image of Trump and his sons being shopped onto Saddam and his sons, decently accurate.
You really want to have this conversation about Trump not being a dictator? I have receipts.  As for pandemic response, ever heard of the swine flu or Ebola? Guess who was in office. There was a pandemic response playbook left for trump. Don‚Äôt play dumb, I don‚Äôt have time.
You must have never listened to Trump speak. I know you don‚Äôt honestly think Trump can put two coherent sentences together.
You don‚Äôt understand how the political system works in this country. It may suck, but it‚Äôs reality. You know damn well you have two feasible options. A third has 0% chance of winning. There are more D‚Äôs than R‚Äôs so a 3rd party vote is a vote for trump.
Keep voting for the ‚Äúthird option‚Äù and bitching about change. The third option ain‚Äôt it. You‚Äôre okay with four more years of trump. Just accept it.
A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the corona virus,Trump is back to pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment and challenging the credibility of the nation‚Äôs leading infectious disease expert.
It‚Äôs unfortunate but I really think it‚Äôs to hurt trump. They don‚Äôt care about America they care about power. This is why we need term limits, because at some point every politician will do something that gets them in trouble and then it‚Äôs over. Term limits can end corruption!

..after they take a piss &amp; nobody complains, but God forbid you protect employees &amp; customers from a deadly virus cuz "that's denying my personal liberties" or whatever the fuk their latest excuse is. MAGA idiots would eat shit &amp; feed it to their kids, too if Trump told them to.
We all witnessed a peaceful protest in Lafayette Square on Natl TV- Trump/Barr fascist regime LIES &amp; they're are videos, witnesses to prove it! Barr/Trump &amp; Gestapo must be prosecuted for attacking peaceful protesters-their actions was FELONY ASSAULT.

You a big Trump fan?
Right. This isn't about DACA it's about giving the finger to SCOTUS and Congress. Trump's saying there's no checks and balances anymore. I'm tired of Pelosi and Co kicking the can down the road to Nov 3 and counting on us to save the nation. They could help us.
Portland Peaceful Protests are sabatoged by Trump Nazis disguised as rioters/ protesters then destroy property &amp; commit arson. WHY ISN'T THE  ON THIS?- ITS THEIR JOB!
right now Trump is saying "make me." You have to either put up our shut up. If Trump and Barr aren't impeached immediately then we know we can't count on the Dems to do anything to save this country. All of you are complicit in the destruction of democracy.
likely also Trump &amp; his closest fascist confederates in admin have been receiving CV antibody convalescent plasma transfusions for months now- which accounts for his refusal to wear a mask &amp; caused many thousands deaths of those exposed by selfish diks who refuse to wear masks.

Trump and others on the right are labeling antifa a terrorist organization, this is in response to that. Other terrorism types aren't relevant to this particular conversation.  We can have that conversation if you want, but it isn't what we're talking about right now.
Voters give Biden higher marks on many positive traits that apply to leadership in the age of the coronavirus, including honesty, capability and caring for Americans.
bap is way off here imo, no way does trump pull that many swing states, I‚Äôd even put money on the idea that he loses Texas

at least Biden campaign HASN'T MURDERED 150,000 Americans &amp; counting-including many Hispanics-as Trump /GOP has gladly done. #maga
Trump builds walls around things because he has a mental age of 5 and needs to see something for it to work in his mind. The White House is one of the most secure places on earth, but he had *multiple* tax payer funded walls put up ONLY for the appearance of protection as well.
it's obvious that Team Trump/Putin have planned their coup since at least 2013-his tweets reveal all- sociopaths are compelled to confess/brag about their "clever" business social political relationship coups. Compiled, Trump's tweets are confessions of his crimes &amp; sociopathy
Why?  Trump keeps shooting himself in the foot and killing Americans.  He‚Äôs doing just fine all by himself. #TrumpIsAnIdiot
There‚Äôs a lot fishy with this pic; Dumpster‚Äôs neck is not corded so this neck belongs to an athlete. Also, Trump‚Äôs face is more fleshy and he has jowls.
it's amazing how defensive Trump #magaidiots are- always having to scream &amp; yell about their dictator when most would just ignore it in "normal" times.
So is this a 15-20 point Biden win? Cause if so no way Trump is carrying Montana
What a "coincidence"! Trump:  "When you do all mail-in voting ballots, you're asking for fraud. People steal them out of mailboxes. People print them and then they sign them and they give them in &amp; people don't even know.." That postman didn't do this as a"joke" someone paid him!

Seems like they have something in common...
Will the election be delayed? No. But before the last one trump claimed fraud, If I don‚Äôt win the system is rigged! Then he lost the pop vote cuz of ‚Äúillegals‚Äù and ‚Äúdead people voting.‚Äù The numbers gotta be there ppl, let‚Äôs make it clear!#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica  #HitTheRoadTrump
Violent rates in my red city in a red state have steadily increasesed the last 3.5 years. It‚Äôs almost as if a Trump‚Äôs polices *haven‚Äôt* lowered crime.
Four more years of the corrupt and incompetent GOP?  The largest federal deficit in history, during a strong economy.  Before the GOP bungled the coronavirus response.  Before the GOP cratered the US economy.   Trump GOP is an embarrassment.
Google US Covid deaths. Google Trump disbanding pandemic response. You seem like a super caring person, so concerned with foreign deaths- why so little about Americans?
Lol. High level trolling by spelling ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù as ‚Äúyour. Well played sir, acting like a moronic Trump supporter is next level shit.
Hey Bill, how many times has President Trump said something tongue-in-cheek. He knows It Would Drive Democrats crazy to suggest this. After all Democrats released the virus.
tbh Trump knows what he's doing. But WHY does he want people do get sick and possibly die? What an asshole he is.
Oh Ya. He is and always will be THE MAN. Nomatter what Trump does or says , he can never take away from the fact that Obama did more for this country in 8 short years, than almost any President in history. And FUCKHEAD TRUMP HATES HIM FOR THAT. He‚Äôs never done anything for us
1- There is no mechanism for Trump to change anything about the way the election is conducted. That was done on purpose. 2- Trump's term expires 20 January 2021 regardless, so if there was no election, Nancy Pelosi would be acting president. Does Trump really want that?
"Soon after the government issued the bleak economic data, President Donald Trump diverted attention by suggesting a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù in the Nov. 3 presidential election, based on his unsubstantiated allegations that widespread mail-in voting will result in fraud."
Trump, his supporters, his gestapo, and those who deny the harm he's caused has damaged the US and its image.  They're nothing but fascist rats that are trying to destroy the United States.
Because it was a garbage narrative created by the Trump crew. Trumps GOP is inept and corrupt.
So... was being a Trump supporter worth it?
How many Trump voters does Trump plan to kill before the 2020 election?
To Trump ‚Äúharmful‚Äù is an accelerant
If Obama said "delay the election" y'all trump supporters would demand him to be removed you fucking hypocrites
Beyblade predicted Trump.
I can never forgive white evangelicalism of the hell and misery they put this country through because of their support of Trump.
The dates of federal elections are enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Constitution says he can't delay the election,   Also President Trump and Vice President Pence voted by mail
Donal Trump effectively rapes our democracy and American public daily - daily!  And we‚Äôre helpless.
The Trump administration is railing against a Montana senator for calling the federal government‚Äôs coronavirus response an ‚ÄúAmerican failure."
I hope all the right wingers in this thread supporting Trump's fascist Stormtroopers arresting anti-racist demonstrators also support China's national security law in Hong Kong aimed at rioters who actually assaulted random and elderly citizens.

Trump is pleasured by forcing people to acknowledge his false narrative.   This is his life, his pathology.
I don't see much language about lesser evil or greater good among Trump folks. Trump is an absolute good and the Dems an absolute evil. There is no anguish or worrying about doing the less harm, there is enthusiasm on the whole. Hoping Biden picks up folks on the margins
Yeah but there are few thousand Marxists scattered in about  a dozen small sectarian groups. Trump is president of the United States and therefore is in a position to do real harm, which has has done non stop since taking office. So in terms of the threat Trumpism is it
Our ecumenical mainline campus ministry is able to hold Trump and Biden supporters and everyone in between, but i think the lines are not so hard with young adults
When it is is numbers like 80% range it is impossible to escape Trump especially in the church. My guess is you could have gone to a Methodist church in the 80s and not get inundated with Marxism.
Ugh. So much work unraveled by dipshits.   Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing
I hear ya man. But you do know WHEN TRUMP wins again.. The Democrats will  let hell  break loose.
Trump‚Äôs GOP created the largest federal deficit in the history of mankind! How does that happen when things are so great and the economy is running so strong?  Corruption and incompetence.  Now the GOP has flubbed the coronavirus response and crashed the economy.
We need balance. We don‚Äôt need extremism from the left or the right. Trump is operating from the far right. Some democrats operate from the far left... we need someone close to middle. It‚Äôs a constant balance of the pendulum that makes us who we are!
At a time when trump is trying to get Russia back to make the G8 there‚Äôs no way in hell putting bounties on American soldiers didn‚Äôt reach his desk. He‚Äôs a lying sack of shit who‚Äôs making us look weak. #LastWord

Obama left the trump administration all set up to confront a pandemic. trump and team totally dismantled what Obama and Biden worked so hard on to prepare for the incoming administration. Barr is a bald faced liar and he and trump need to quit blaming Obama for their ineptness.
Trump talked about trickle down economics when he ran in 2016... unfortunately we are seeing the trickle down of divisiveness instead... Good Leaders (no matter what job/level) must own everything in their world.
I keep picturing trump patting Barr on his fat head telling him what a good boy he is. I‚Äôm gonna need anger management if I watch anymore of this.

Sillly gummy bear! that‚Äôs your fiction-base view of the US. However, Saddam, Noriega, and the Iran-Contra drugs-for-arms were all committed with GOP administration approval and define shortsighted nature of the GOP. don‚Äôt forget, trump just abandoned US allies in Syria as well.
Your myopic view of reality is pathetic. trump has broken more of the Ten Commandments than not, failed to once mention bounties on GIs by Russia, and placed millions of lives at risk by spending February and half of March deflecting, lying, &amp; golfing during a pandemic.

And there is the Trump reference. Ever 90's movie in New York has one lol. I like this one, Trump has to skip a party that is attended by people in league with Satan.
Questions and answers about this unconventional, if not unprecedented, use of federal forces. Is it legal? What comes next?
Trump 2020!üá∫üá∏
It's hard to say why.  I'm not claiming that's the case with him, it could just be he sees his best future with the anti-Trump Republican brand.
Even creepier, they were hired by Trump‚Äôs admin, ‚Äúprivate police‚Äù on taxpayer money.  #Portland authorities never requested federal help. Worse than secret police, they‚Äôre an election prop harming citizens in an unconstitutional floor show for votes. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.
"Trump appears to be trying to do something novel in this country: establishing a force like interior ministries in other countries," writes
By the end of the year expect between 230,000 and 650,000 Americans dead from the Trump Virus.
A good friend of my wife‚Äôs works in a hospital here in Montana. She was treating a man who truly believed COVID was a hoax to ‚Äúoverthrow‚Äù Trump. He is next in line for a ventilator. He is shocked and frightened that it‚Äôs real. #WearADamnMask
Funny how Trump supporters treat deaths as ‚Äúpolitical‚ÄùStocks, dollar slide on economic data, Trump election tweet
TREASURIES-Poor economic data, Trump tweet send yields to lowest in months
US STOCKS-S&amp;P 500, Dow slip after grim data; Trump suggests election delay
My vote is for freedom, not democratic socialism. Trump muthafucka
Trump knows he‚Äôs losing in November so he going out with a bang üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Lord Trump the Protector of Our Liberties and Savior of America also sits at the right hand of God, why would he ever need to leave?  Are they still talking about doing that pesky election?  It's been cancelled, were you not aware?  Oh, maybe that isn't in the talking points yet.
Mail-in voting is the only sure way that we are going to beat Trump without him cheating he should be afraid he's on his way out
Of course Trump doesn't like it he can't cheat like he did in 2016
Anyone actually supporting Trump on this one? Anyone? Anyone at all? ü§ì
Can you really be a Trump supporter if you wear a mask? I see a few  mask-wearers in the crowd, are they spies for #Biden2020 ?
What if‚Ä¶hear me out, Trump‚Äôs craziest ideas usually come after he talks to Putin? Has anyone done research on this?
No they just hate Trump
And Trump wants us to pay a tax on the relief money the gov is giving to help us that's not right
I don't like Trump because I‚Äôm an American and he is a Trumpian. #NobodyLikesTrump
I'm sorry...what?! How unbelievably tone deaf and discriminatory. Not all of us were born into privilege and money, Mr. Trump. Your dream is a classist farce.
Because Trump is and always will be a coward
The Trump golden touch is still alive and well. **sarcasms of laughter**
No he didn‚Äôt. Based on the information available at the time, he made the decision not not advocate the use of masks. Unlike tRump, who can‚Äôt admit when he‚Äôs wrong, he changed his recommendations.
Yes, they need to learn. Trump neeeeeeeds the FBI Building to stay where it is. The Trump Hotel is across the street and they don‚Äôt want competition from another hotel. Why don't we understand this simple fact?  Geez.üôÑ
Given what we know about Trump‚Äôs psychopathy, it‚Äôs possible Putin doesn‚Äôt have tapes. Putin only has to tell Donald, ‚ÄúYou is smart, you is kind, you is important‚Äù on a regular basis. Apologies to Viola Davis, I know she regrets that movie.
Do they have to?  tRump disregards all rules when using our $$$ to fund his dirty deeds.
I thought tRump took hydroxychloroquine as a preventative against Coronavirus. Dr. Demon Sperm says she used it to ‚Äúsuccessfully  treat‚Äù COVID-19?  What‚Äôs it gonna be, guys? Do you have to take it first or get it first?? Your research methods leave a lot to be desired. #LiarsRUs
Yeah, run 3rd party and assure a Trump victory and descent into fascism. Great plan!
Laws are for everyone but Donald Trump doesn't believe laws apply to him. He has lived his entire life that way. Executive Privilege and Presidential Immunity are his only defense. He believes he cannot ever be wrong because he is Donald Trump.
GOP coronavirus bill replaces money for Pentagon projects Trump raided for border wall
Debate Trump! Come out of the basement Joe
Vote for Trump then
Not to mention, I saw a story online that the FBI building in question would involve taking ownership of a plot of land a hotel is trying to build their newest hotel on, which would be VERY close to one of Trump's hotels and compete with it for guests.
They should vote for Trump then
Should have thought your word spacing through, there, Sir. This also reads, "Donald J. Trump would destroy our cities...etc."  Now that's something I could believe.
This tweet should be mass media. "Kkkeep America Great." Is Donald Trump.
Why does this matter? Trump said he wouldn‚Äôt run for president too.
I live in a Red State. I haven‚Äôt met any Trump supporters who will say they have seen the light but a few are getting closer. I nod my head and try not to scare them back into hiding.
No, tRump has been cultivating this for the last 3+ years.
Trump is bored with the ‚Äúinvisible ‚Äú virus.  He wants to see Americans getting dominated in our streets. The power of the Presidency is greater than his self control. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Put the videos on TV üì∫. Trump is running the airway in North Carolina
We'll justify it by calling it "peaceful retaliation" or "peaceful protection".
She's desperate, the whole party is.  They may implode when Trump wins re-election
You a Trump supporter or nah?
Trump 2020 BABY!!!
We need to bring our Country back to the people by the people for the people. We can't loose to Trump again and his lies false accusations is bigotry and his white supremacy
Wow very powerful great to the point this is what Trump and his family and his followers want to happen but good will prevail change for our country will come in the color of Blue so vote everyone
Same old political meaningless rhetoric spewing talking points and Trump hate.  No new solutions only liberal bias.
Trump is a gangster
Pat Roberts isn‚Äôt saying anything about God striking out at moneychangers and adulterers? Huh. I think God is getting fed up with Trump‚Äôs GOP for how they are treating His children.
Dude all your tweets since 2016 have been how deep shit Trump is in... but here we are in 2020...ü§Ø
They‚Äôre using them all up on testing the people around tRump every day because he won‚Äôt wear a mask.
tRump doesn‚Äôt live the same reality as most of us.
Of course tRump is fighting the American people. He hates them now, ‚Äòcuz they‚Äôre not giving him the love. Just wait, he‚Äôs got a nasty surprise for all of us if he loses the election.
Because they‚Äôre constantly throwing them media bones like tRump‚Äôs ‚Äúintelligence ‚Äú test.
I know exactly what ‚Äúmotivated tRump‚Äôs outlandish display‚Äù of warm feelings toward Ms. Maxwell-he wants her to cover his sorry ass in any upcoming investigation, in which he is most certainly involved.
What happened to the Constitution?  3 short years of tRump rendered it irrelevant.
President Donald J. Trump!!   I bet he‚Äôs a once in a lifetime experience.   Has any other president had rallies like his?  Has anyone ever flown flags with our presidents name on them?
1,000% Agree with Carolyn Hinds here.  I'll totally agree with people that Biden is nowhere near as bad as Trump on racism, sexism and disregard for the poor/medically marginalized.   But, oh holy crap does he have some problematic blind spots...
It‚Äôs ok, Trump made another $20mill in a couple hours yesterday at a virtual fundraiser by 300,000 people. He‚Äôs got WAY more money than Biden.
Trump has not aggressively responded to the virus!! The people are not falling for your spin.
As  said, with Donald Trump, it‚Äôs just Tuesday
