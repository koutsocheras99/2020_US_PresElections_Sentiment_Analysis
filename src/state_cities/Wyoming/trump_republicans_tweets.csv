Well considering the BLM protestors have been breaking and destroying property, along with murdering people, I’d say Trump has more than enough reason to deploy the National Guard
I’m just spitballing here and I could be wrong but as I understand it all law enforcement have to identify themselves.
these people can do nothing on the normal way, they are born as cheaters, they grew up as cheaters and they will go down as such, history will put "Cheater" behind the name of Trump  and Assoc.
They want no government that helps it's citizens. They want a government that harm's people they think of as " other" Trump is the Antichrist
This is how trump treats American citizens. This is how trump feels abt our rights to peacefully protest

What does it matter at this point, the way the country is going it’ll be reduced to pile of ashes if Trump gets another 4 years. Tik Tok is the least of our problems.

At this point I'm not even sure we've had a non racist president. Both trump and biden are for sure. We literally had slave owner presidents. Even Obama opened the camps in the southern border.
I believe trump is a racist yes but... so is  biden? we literally had slave owners be president. Trump was definitely not the first. Hell i don't even know who the first nonracist president was. FDR and JFK were still, racist. I dont even know if Obama counts as not racist.

The difference between the 3 past presidents is that people voted for Bush and Obama knowing their politics.  Although Trump’s politics were also apparent to the few conservatives who didn’t vote for him, it seems like for most, his leftism has come as a total surprise.
