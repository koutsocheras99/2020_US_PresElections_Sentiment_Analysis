I really like Karen Bass!!  She seems like she would really fit with Biden!!
I talk to Bernie people everyday and that’s not what we hear. Biden all the way to the WH
We are now? 150,000 people died in 4 months doesn’t sound safe to me. This a Republican is voting BLUE BIDEN ALL THE WAY.
The Focus on the Family founder warned the country about the HORRORS of an Obama presidency in 2008. His concerns didn't pan out.   Now he's saying the same things about Biden.
How does this undermine our national security interest?  Seems the total plan would be in our best interest.  troops get spread out and maybe those other countries will step up and do their fair share.  BTW  the big WRONG message was sent by the Obama  Biden administration.
Well, who the hell else are you gonna vote for? Biden? Sanders? One guy will molest your daughter, the other will molest your wallet.
A reminder: Whenever Joe Biden announces his VP, liberals will be furious it wasn't their first choice, and conservatives will say "Democrats in disarray!" while exaggerating every past blemish on her record.   IGNORE IT. None of it changes how Trump must be defeated.
Your logic is weird, because then Kamala lost to pretty much every candidate, who all lost to Sanders, who only lost because it took everyone dropping out and supporting Biden for him to win  😆 Sanders lost and there is no disputing that, but he lost to the DNC not to Biden

You have to ask yourself how/why the Democrats couldn't put up a better candidate than Biden. Seriously, there is something very wrong here.
I seriously have yet to see in ONE Biden flag or bumpersticker and I live in a very liberal town
Trump never debated Clinton. He just abused the truth and her. He does not deserve to “debate” Biden given his lies and corruption. No need to debate a criminal, impeached and convicted and conflicted.
“Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, this week declined to answer a colleague's question about whether he had received derogatory information about Vice President Joe Biden…”

Actually that sounds a lot like the doofuses who plan on voting for Biden.

Must we pretend there's an invisible barrier that will protect us? I mean, if I have to I'll play along, but it's not fun.  Say Biden wins by a lot. Does anyone think Trump/Barr can't send uniformed guys to Biden's house before the inauguration to arrest &amp; send him to Guantanamo?
Don’t stoop. I got the finger at a stoplight from a trumper because of my Biden sticker. I shrugged. It felt right.

Awesome point, Ryan. Question: when your house is on fire do you insist on distilled water and fire fighters who pass your purity tests? Asking for a country that’s on fucking fire and Biden and the Democrats are the only fire fighters who can douse this inferno. Grow up.
“But it's also possible Trump, intentionally or not, is setting a trap by shifting more of his own vote to Election Day while Biden's ballots face a higher risk of rejection, legal limbo and lengthy counting delays”
“Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here’s how far we have to go.”
Biden is a fraud and his Handlers are the Rulers.
It's gonna look real bad on the Too Senile crowd when Biden functions normally, essentially hurdling over the low bar they've set for him.
Isn't attacking someone for their opinion imposing a different purity test?  I'll be voting for Biden, pandering and all.  I hope he does a great job.
Went out the window a long time ago
Do you mean like ANTIFA is A myth?   Mr. Nadler requires a cognitive health examination.... Quite clear that his mental health is declining and he may well be worse off than Biden.
All that does is concern me who actually is. Who is pulling the strings on the Biden puppet
Susan Rice has probably been thrown around the most outside of the two that were presidential nominees. Do you think her experience would make her qualified for stepping in if she had to? That’s my only concern, especially if Biden is 1 term.
Nah, let Biden remodel it himself.  Trump will be gone before they can even get started.

You have failed at everything you’ve ever done. Biden warned us SEVENTY FIVE days before you acknowledged the Virus. Step Up, be a man. You’re a boob and 50 Million are unemployed BECAUSE of YOUR GREATNESS.
“Sleepy Biden” sounds Soooo good right now!

They better come out before the elections. Otherwise, if Biden wins, gets impeached. Now we have Harris as President.
Yeah but if Biden loses you do realize the Democrats are probably just gonna go for an even more centrist platform right? Again there is a progressive minority in the democratic party. Putting power into that party empowers that minority more than putting power into the GOP.
trump and biden. 2 sides of the same coin. fitting for the 2 parties. reminds me of the classic meme
I don't think there is a candidate that can fix your situation. But do you think a Biden presidency would have done as bad a job as Trump in dealing with the COVID crises?
Electing Joe biden is not just about electing Biden, its about electing democrats, which is the only vehicle through which progressive policy can flow, even if the majority of the democrats are centrist dipshits.
I rather have Biden but damn.
Sorry about the "man" comment. Force of habit, will try to do better in the future.   Everything Biden pushes through is gonna be a half-measure that is going to be woefully inadequate to fix the poorest and most vulnerable of us.
The media has caused the public drama. I haven’t seen Joe Biden doubt teasers and trailers.
Have you even looked at Biden's housing plans? If he sticks to even one promise in that list America will be made a better place man.   Also people always forget that a democratic president still empowers the progressive minority of the party in Congress.
She’d accept the invitation if she thought Biden would win
With everything else I can’t see Biden’s vp pick making or breaking the election. It’s a referendum on trump and that’s it
Joe Biden never called for any such thing

He was there, but he never messed with anyone again after Biden called him a lying dog faced pony

Yes but then you have the problem with people lying in that they are with the people. That's how Donald got elected and that's how many leaders get chosen to be leaders, like Biden.
if someone can, in good conscience, vote for either biden or trump, i am very concerned about that person and their morals
nothing wrong with not voting for a shitty candidate. trump and biden both suck. if people don't wanna fall in line and vote for the broken party's candidate that doesnt represent their voters, you can't blame em for that. we dont wanna pick the lesser of 2 evils again like 2016
BREAKING: Trump has a new nickname for Joe Biden.  In keeping with his tradition Trump has a little projection baked into "Sending US Troops To Attack Peaceful Protesters" Biden. 🥁
👍🏻 Way to go Biden. 👌🏻This is how a POTUS is supposed to sound. 👊🏻 #RidenWithBiden2020 #trumpisapussy
I mean...I could be glib and say either "Donald Trump" or "Joe Biden." The label is a clearly accurate description of both men - Biden wrote the 1994 crime bill, when alive - for all their b/s-ing and lying.
I fully disagree. Biden isn’t encouraging violence in the least.
Yes.  That’s how a centrist like Biden won the nomination.  🙄  It never fails reading the replies to Casten’s tweets - new day, same clowns.
It’s amazing that there isn’t even a thoughtful discussion happening on both sides of aisle regarding Biden’s cognitive decline. He is like a “host”, a strawman for eventual Dem control of Presidency. Stand him up in the Rose Garden to read a teleprompter of Dem policies.
Tbh M4A has a better chance of surviving 4 years of Trump than it does Biden and the Democrats. If people don't want leftists to abandon Biden, then give them a reason to vote for him. What no one seems to realize is Leftists vote on morals and policies, not "Red bad blue good"
Ugh. So tired of this “What if he doesn’t leave?” argument. If he loses, he ceases to be president on Inauguration Day. If his petulant ass won’t leave the Oval, Biden will have him escorted out by security. Period.
White female Biden supporter here. I’ll be thrilled if Joe chooses a WOC for his VP. If you imagine some kind of “backlash” that says something about you.

Biden may longterm NOT be the lesser of two evils.
Maybe Jake Tapper can ask Joe Biden why he's too chickenshit to sit with Wallace for an interview.   At least Trump did.
I'm participating in the DNC Platform Committee meeting and Biden/DNC people just opposed any effort to include Medicare for All. My climate amendments that opposed Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) were removed without consent. Biden is still 2 little 2 late.
This is so ignorant. Biden made it crystal clear when he was first running, that he “wasn’t Bernie Sanders”. Elizabeth Warren has pulled him left and completely influenced his platform. To act as if picking Warren as VP doesn’t matter is just stupid.more snake emoji nonsense
Biden is already the corporate donors' bitch, and that is to whom he, or the neocons and neolibs surrounding his brainstem, will listen. As Lawrence O'Donnell has said, Dems will only listen to The Left, if we refuse to vote for them. I will not.
I think Susan Rice would be a bad choice for Biden.  Too much baggage.  Harris and Demmings are my two top choices now.
Wake up and smell the roses, Biden’s a joke and so is your support for him.
You seriously think Trump supporters are going to listen to you? 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Biden can’t even form a complete sentence and refuses to take questions from media, debate Trump, or be interviewed by Chris Wallace.   Your party is a joke if that’s the best you can do.
Biden should publish his medical history to prove he is not cognitively impaired. In other words can he put all the square pegs in the square holes, and round pegs in the round holes?
She had her turn. It is all about a poison pill for debate negotiations so they will never happen. It is the DNC attempt to put Biden in the basement till Nov 4th.

✔️ You're so right, I think that's becoming apparent.  Biden doesn't even need to (nor does he) respond to stupid things Trump says about him.  When he gets to the White House he should get a rescue pitbull and name it Lincoln Project
Just because you vote for Joe Biden doesn’t mean he will actually be the president.
So very true
Would you like Biden to point out your missteps speaking?  The Daily Show has a nice montage.  Poke the pony and Biden could make you look really bad.
No one believes you on Obama/Biden being the most corrupt.
Mine too - I allow myself about 5 minutes of happy and then tell myself that Biden is 20 points behind. Polls mean nothing and we keep on, working even harder than before.

I was just about to tweet the same thing but scrolled down. Really Marianne? Jon is 100% correct - Biden is a stooge and has turned his back on love his whole career. Worse, he has used people’s good nature for his own ends and those for whom he is simply a #Bagman. Cmon!

Answer to Who is best suited to fix the U.S. economy between Joe Biden and Donald Trump? by Henry Morgan
We are witnessing the exact same thing with Biden and Trump that happened with Reagan when he was elected
That's about the only reason to do it.  But I don't think that's a good enough reason.  Biden can do another town hall instead, to prove he's fine
To clarify - if any candidate were doing as well as Biden I'd also advise them not to debate.  It's not that I'm worried Joe will do poorly, it's that there is no upside for him.  I like that idea of Trump releasing his taxes as a precondition.
Joe Biden Interviews Andrew Yang  via
I'm thinking Biden can only lose ground.  If he does very well he breaks even.
That's the flip side.  I think Biden can just say no and be fine.  He can't gain anything from the debates
I think Trump needs the dates, Biden doesn't
That's the other side of the equation.  We know Trump will come prepared with only insults &amp; nicknames for Biden, his son &amp; wife.  I don't think Biden loses anything saying "Buzz off. I'm not going to debate the Malarkey Madman since we already know Trump doesn't know any facts."
DEBATES Is there even one reason for Biden to agree to debate?  There's only downside when he's up this much in all the polls
You wanna “beat biden off”? Bro, check your tweets before you make yourself look a fool even more.
Not a thing to earn my vote, if anything he's pushed me away. I am willing to admit Trump is PROBABLY worse than a Biden Administration,  but I'm still not going out there to vote for him. I said I was done with the lesser of two evils voting, and I meant it

n the interviews with liberals, Biden has not been asked to repeat the words, "I support defunding the police." Instead, he has been asked whether he supports redirecting funding from police departments to other purposes. And he has said that he does. From Washington Examiner
Describe Joe Biden in a paragraph
I pray they publicly identify every single one of these gestapo agents and — “following orders” or not — President Biden makes it a point to have all of them tried for war crimes.
Biden is NOT defunding police !!!
Speaking of polls, here’s one from your friends at Fox ..  Polls:  #Michigan: Biden 49% (+9) Trump 40% #Pennsylvania: Biden 50% (+11) Trump 39% #Minnesota: Biden 51% (+13) Trump 38%.                                 Any comment?  Didn’t think so. Facts aren’t your thing.
Rasmussen, a Republican biased poll, has you at 80%. That's about 60,000,000 people. Not enough to win in November based on your polling against Biden. You shouldn't be golfing this weekend. You should have stayed in DC.
I’m convinced Trump sees the writing on the wall. He knows he’s going to lose in November and is intent on leaving the country in the worst financial shape possible for Joe Biden to deal with. He is that much of a monster.
When Biden wins the election. He may not be able to do much. Think about that.. We need to also take over the Senate. Replace them all!!

I guess we all do, but you think Trump &amp; Biden will do the same things?  I don't and I have a tough time thinking you really do. I get the Kasich anger, but Biden had said months ago, half-heartedly, he'd consider a Republican VP.  Obama kept Gates on.  Some bipartisanship's ok.
?? Untill Kasich you were Team Biden. You accepted him quicker than I. Now he was always horrible? Which was the perfect candidate? They were all flawed, humans with imperfect records. Biden won't kill the ACA &amp; would have done better on Covid. He'll hike corp &amp; wealth taxes.
Biden won't win. Why do you hope we change our minds trump is running our country into the ground condoning hatred and blaming others for shit he is responsible for. I know your a bears fan and that's where it end for us , exactly why I don't follow you anymore don't have time✌️
A write in won't win.  When the choice is Trump or Biden, I'll take Biden.
His last win in 2016 was practically a miraculous, stars aligning phenomenon. Since then, he’s lost lots of voters, especially independents. Factor in that HRC was not well liked and Biden is. Nope, I think Trump loses bigly.
Don’t need a book for that Step one: Elect Joe Biden Step two: District him with a shiny object Step Three: Socialism! Yeah!

There's so much Trump has done against our way of Democracy. But, it only less than 103 days before we change things. VOTE,  VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, let get a new person in the White House.  BIDEN!!!
Unfortunately, right now we are NOT better than this. We can be better than this, and if Joe Biden wins, we WILL be better than this. But it's going to take a lot of work to undo the evil that's been wrought by the Republican Party over the past 40 years.
Anyone that thinks Trump need  another 4 yrs, should move to the USSR. And take Trump with you. Biden is the clear choice to start bring  our country back to a global strategy, and strong  economy. Trump is a Puttin  flockly. You're a trader if you can't defend American soldier.
I have been getting your point. Let's play make believe. Biden wins. He won't runn again in 4 years. If he, or whoever is guiding (I know you'd prefer "controlling") him accomplish enough good then a Democrat will likely win in 2024. If they blow it then Kasich has sound bites.
Note to self (and Biden): Do NOT piss off Neil.  He does not let something slide.
3. Joe, your 1994 Biden Crime Bill started the trend of mass incarceration(See graph) &amp; critics are correct in saying it effects African-American men at a disproportionate rate. In 2015 you boasted, “I’m proud of that bill!” With the families you destroyed are you still proud?
Not Biden.
Trump’s “base” voted for him in 2016, but the rest voted against Hillary Clinton.    Biden isn’t that despised in 2020 just yet.  All he needs to do is avoid choosing someone like a Susan Rice or Sarah Palin for VP.  “Small steps, Sparks.  Small steps.”
I'd like to counter your argument with asking the question, how could possibly be blaming Biden for the current state of the country?
Trump needs to shove this down Biden's throat before election day.

They have to pick Susan Rice because she has a simple name. Biden will never be able to say “Kamala” right. It will cause too many gaffes.
A reminder: Whenever Joe Biden announces his VP, liberals will be furious it wasn't their first choice, and conservatives will say "Democrats in disarray!" while exaggerating every past blemish on her record.   IGNORE IT. None of it changes how Trump must be defeated.
Your logic is weird, because then Kamala lost to pretty much every candidate, who all lost to Sanders, who only lost because it took everyone dropping out and supporting Biden for him to win  😆 Sanders lost and there is no disputing that, but he lost to the DNC not to Biden

You have to ask yourself how/why the Democrats couldn't put up a better candidate than Biden. Seriously, there is something very wrong here.

He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.

Susan Rice has probably been thrown around the most outside of the two that were presidential nominees. Do you think her experience would make her qualified for stepping in if she had to? That’s my only concern, especially if Biden is 1 term.
Nah, let Biden remodel it himself.  Trump will be gone before they can even get started.

My guess is Biden will be a one term President (due to age). Keep a close eye on who the VP choice is.
Biden wouldn’t destroy the environment. Biden would restore our allies faith in our country. Biden would restore the economy (as Clinton and Obama did before him) Biden wouldnt allow the Russians to get away with bounties on American soldiers. I didn’t even say the T word.

CNN is showing Biden's note from yesterday this morning.
Yeah but if Biden loses you do realize the Democrats are probably just gonna go for an even more centrist platform right? Again there is a progressive minority in the democratic party. Putting power into that party empowers that minority more than putting power into the GOP.
I don't think there is a candidate that can fix your situation. But do you think a Biden presidency would have done as bad a job as Trump in dealing with the COVID crises?
Electing Joe biden is not just about electing Biden, its about electing democrats, which is the only vehicle through which progressive policy can flow, even if the majority of the democrats are centrist dipshits.
I rather have Biden but damn.
Sorry about the "man" comment. Force of habit, will try to do better in the future.   Everything Biden pushes through is gonna be a half-measure that is going to be woefully inadequate to fix the poorest and most vulnerable of us.
The media has caused the public drama. I haven’t seen Joe Biden doubt teasers and trailers.
Have you even looked at Biden's housing plans? If he sticks to even one promise in that list America will be made a better place man.   Also people always forget that a democratic president still empowers the progressive minority of the party in Congress.

Sure, after you destroyed it, Joe Biden will make it great again. Step aside, Donnie.
Tbh M4A has a better chance of surviving 4 years of Trump than it does Biden and the Democrats. If people don't want leftists to abandon Biden, then give them a reason to vote for him. What no one seems to realize is Leftists vote on morals and policies, not "Red bad blue good"
Something else to consider.
Ugh. So tired of this “What if he doesn’t leave?” argument. If he loses, he ceases to be president on Inauguration Day. If his petulant ass won’t leave the Oval, Biden will have him escorted out by security. Period.
White female Biden supporter here. I’ll be thrilled if Joe chooses a WOC for his VP. If you imagine some kind of “backlash” that says something about you.

There won’t be a debate unless Biden feels he’s losing &amp; has to do it. right now Bidens not feeling the heat so he’ll make up some excuse to avoid having to go toe to toe with the President.
Biden is already the corporate donors' bitch, and that is to whom he, or the neocons and neolibs surrounding his brainstem, will listen. As Lawrence O'Donnell has said, Dems will only listen to The Left, if we refuse to vote for them. I will not.
Organizers expect those efforts will net hundreds more signatures, including from Biden delegates...
I think Susan Rice would be a bad choice for Biden.  Too much baggage.  Harris and Demmings are my two top choices now.
Biden says Trump was the first racist president. One bullet in the foot. Now he appoints Chris Dodd to the VP selection committee. Another bullet in the foot.  Please, please, don't follow the traditional Democratic path of blowing a sure thing!
Wake up and smell the roses, Biden’s a joke and so is your support for him.
You seriously think Trump supporters are going to listen to you? 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Biden can’t even form a complete sentence and refuses to take questions from media, debate Trump, or be interviewed by Chris Wallace.   Your party is a joke if that’s the best you can do.
So very nice of her to spruce it up for the Biden’s.

Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
The polls are showing 72% in favor of Biden. Can't wait for that Silent Majority (72%) to vote.
It certainly appears that EVERY tweet of yours is a lie, Donnie. Why is that?  YOU vote by mail-in! Everyone knows YOU are a pathological liar. Biden's gonna crush you in November. I'll do my part. Then the SDNY will do their part. Be afraid, Donnie.
LIKE OR NOT LIKE? In the same announcement, Biden should unveil both his VP choice AND his cabinet nominees.  Trump has surrounded himself with yes men / unqualified hacks.  This move would further show the contrast between Biden's &amp; Trump's focus on governing.
False. Biden is crushing Trump. All Biden has to do is let Trump whine to Fox "News," Hannity and tweet. In reality, Trump is crushing himself. From COVID-19 to the economy to race relations, Trump has taken a giant dump on America. Biden will win in a landslide.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Think about it. Trump is law and order and Biden is riot and loot.
✔️ You're so right, I think that's becoming apparent.  Biden doesn't even need to (nor does he) respond to stupid things Trump says about him.  When he gets to the White House he should get a rescue pitbull and name it Lincoln Project
Just because you vote for Joe Biden doesn’t mean he will actually be the president.
Would you like Biden to point out your missteps speaking?  The Daily Show has a nice montage.  Poke the pony and Biden could make you look really bad.
No one believes you on Obama/Biden being the most corrupt.
America needs Joe Biden’s compassion and experience. He is uniquely capable to put our country back together.He knows how it should work, could work better, and who he needs to help him get it done.
Mine too - I allow myself about 5 minutes of happy and then tell myself that Biden is 20 points behind. Polls mean nothing and we keep on, working even harder than before.
I was just about to tweet the same thing but scrolled down. Really Marianne? Jon is 100% correct - Biden is a stooge and has turned his back on love his whole career. Worse, he has used people’s good nature for his own ends and those for whom he is simply a #Bagman. Cmon!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
That's about the only reason to do it.  But I don't think that's a good enough reason.  Biden can do another town hall instead, to prove he's fine
To clarify - if any candidate were doing as well as Biden I'd also advise them not to debate.  It's not that I'm worried Joe will do poorly, it's that there is no upside for him.  I like that idea of Trump releasing his taxes as a precondition.
I'm thinking Biden can only lose ground.  If he does very well he breaks even.
That's the flip side.  I think Biden can just say no and be fine.  He can't gain anything from the debates
I think Trump needs the dates, Biden doesn't
That's the other side of the equation.  We know Trump will come prepared with only insults &amp; nicknames for Biden, his son &amp; wife.  I don't think Biden loses anything saying "Buzz off. I'm not going to debate the Malarkey Madman since we already know Trump doesn't know any facts."
DEBATES Is there even one reason for Biden to agree to debate?  There's only downside when he's up this much in all the polls
Tell President Trump that he needs to have one of his debates with Joe Biden moderated by blacks.
If Trump were the mayor of Chicago crime would be under control. Let that sink in because Biden is less competent that Lightfoot.
5 or 6 months late, Homie. There are now almost 150,000 Americans dead from the Trump Virus. You failed. Trump failed. Republicans failed. The American people won't fail in November. Biden in a landslide!
145,000 dead Americans won't be voting for Donnie. Many of the 11% unemployed won't either. Neither will many women or people of color. Certainly very few Dems and independents will vote for the worst president ever. Can you say *landslide for Biden*?
Nope. We're certainly not going to (re)elect the  absolute worst president in the history of the United States. We will elect Joe Biden in a landslide. Bless your heart, Junior. Time is running out, indeed. Buh bye.
Not a thing to earn my vote, if anything he's pushed me away. I am willing to admit Trump is PROBABLY worse than a Biden Administration,  but I'm still not going out there to vote for him. I said I was done with the lesser of two evils voting, and I meant it

n the interviews with liberals, Biden has not been asked to repeat the words, "I support defunding the police." Instead, he has been asked whether he supports redirecting funding from police departments to other purposes. And he has said that he does. From Washington Examiner
Whoever did that to those officers should absolutely be arrested and charged. That being said, I'm looking forward to a Biden landslide in November.
Biden is NOT defunding police !!!
Speaking of polls, here’s one from your friends at Fox ..  Polls:  #Michigan: Biden 49% (+9) Trump 40% #Pennsylvania: Biden 50% (+11) Trump 39% #Minnesota: Biden 51% (+13) Trump 38%.                                 Any comment?  Didn’t think so. Facts aren’t your thing.
Rasmussen, a Republican biased poll, has you at 80%. That's about 60,000,000 people. Not enough to win in November based on your polling against Biden. You shouldn't be golfing this weekend. You should have stayed in DC.
Yes, really. You’re being lied to. He didn’t cause the deaths, and he didn’t wreck the economy. We who see the truth will not be distracted. We will support our president over Biden the puppet. We will not be bullied by the elites like you or your socialist mobs.
Watching a Dan Jones history video about Edward IV. Hanging out in the background is a mentally unstable Henry VI, who very much reminds me of Joe Biden.  I’m sorry they just killed The Earl of Warwick.
I’m convinced Trump sees the writing on the wall. He knows he’s going to lose in November and is intent on leaving the country in the worst financial shape possible for Joe Biden to deal with. He is that much of a monster.
Sssssh. Biden will call you a racist:
Because you and Trump don't give a damn about American lives!  We have 3 1/2 years of evidence. The nation, and in fact the world, is looking forward to Joe Biden's landslide victory on November 3rd.

As we all know basement Biden has big mental issues!
?? Untill Kasich you were Team Biden. You accepted him quicker than I. Now he was always horrible? Which was the perfect candidate? They were all flawed, humans with imperfect records. Biden won't kill the ACA &amp; would have done better on Covid. He'll hike corp &amp; wealth taxes.

Joe Biden called Trump "the first racist President." Leaving aside the conversation about whether Big Orange is in fact racist in any real sense......my guy: the FIRST? Twelve Presidents owned slaves. #awkward_moment
I don’t understand why you use the plural form to describe Joe Biden’s supporter?

I'm not saying he is, but I would take a mildly demented Biden over Trump as he is now, any day of the week.

Vice President Joe Biden made it illegal not to have health insurance | Opinion -  Big fan of Rose. I was on her show 4-5 years ago
I really really really really, and I can’t state this enough, really can’t wait for to cast my all Democratic ballot with Joe Biden at the top.Yes noticeably young. So disturbing. Biden needs to be talking about our education system
Keep spewing left wing propaganda.Obama(worst president of all time)funded terrorist organizations with cold cash via Iran, and the worst president is backing Biden,who has been a political waste of space for 40yrs.Keep burning cities while dividing the left and uniting the right
I agree. Trump who believes in space alien cures and Biden who believes in real science. Trump is a racist pig and Biden is a very decent person.
Biden being close in Kansas means that JoCo is probably close to being a 20 point win for him!  Tell that to a Kansas politico in like 2008 or 2012 and they would be blown away.
This Trump+8/Walz+3 district in the Moorhead area is a pretty good example of a district that Biden probably outperforms Clinton in. A good margin here for Collin Peterson is also key to his re-election.  As for Eken, he should be fine in his re-election bid.
and will vote Biden
I will make sure to use a mask and face shield  and go out and vote for Biden. I am telling everyone I know not to use mail in ballots and use a double mask and take hand sanitizer.  will get away with 150,000 death.
Joe Biden outperforming Tim Walz's 2018 governor performance IN WALZ'S OWN CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT?!?!?  Color me shocked, skeptical, and surprised I guess
One reason I went with Biden in the primary that month.
I’m voting for Biden if he chose a rock as his VP.
I wish Biden would name his planned cabinet once he name Harris as his VP. That would be awesome. Pete, Beto, Rice, Yates to name a few...
I can just imagine the Tucker writing team just being like: "Alright, we've got nothing tonight. Just go on Wikipedia and go to Joe Biden's page to see what he's done I guess."
GUESS BOTH WOULD NOW QUALIFY FOR BIDEN’S VPOTUS SELECTIONS 🤔

Replace “Mike Ditka” with Joe Biden and you’re right. Only difference is Mike can still put a sentence together
Are you trying to ask Biden to pick  ? I hope not
There are much worse turds you could vote for. The thing I remind myself is that Biden is going to be an interim president. The main focus needs to be get trump out. We need some breathing room.
Biden? I know, right!
As opposed to not showering at all like Bunker Biden
Good luck! Biden is a Centene Sycophant  ACA is a money laundering criminal organization
I wish Biden was a Trojan horse for socialism would be much easier to vote for him.
Just found proof on Bunker Biden...this was taken today
Trump could spend the rest of his life on camera and never hit as many gaffes as Biden...ever!
Analogy: a comparison between two things for the purpose of explination and clarification.   Example: Biden hides in his basement as if it were a bunker, hence the nickname Bunker Biden   Basement and bunker are the two things being compared in this analogy.
This helps trump...bunker Biden is going to struggle!
I already watched hour of pointlessness but if you want we can both agree to just assume the image is right then. Biden is clearly a racist, don’t take my word for it 😂
The difference between you and I is that I can acknowledge politically skewed material with context and develop a sound rational opinion. (Like the Biden image). Trump never hurts the economy. Trump doesn’t push division, he just pushes against the radical left.
Biden was interviewing a nominee for a federally appointed judge who had been accused of saying that, he needed to ask the question in order to get a sworn answer on the records. Given the setting and context that image is a misrepresentation of Biden (I don’t like Biden)
this tweet shows kanyes intentions with running for president. He wants to disrupt the election and take votes from Biden so that Trump can win.
Trump international hotel isn’t successful because he is president...it was successful long before he ran for office. Unlike Biden, who only became rich when his dad was Vice President. Wow, the snowflakes on the left are so moronic!
Um, the Biden scandal is not propaganda, there is audio and footage of extortion. It’s being investigated and charges will be filed. And, if you remove trump from the White House he still makes that money. He isn’t making that money because he is president, dum dum!
And your point is? Let me break it down for you...trump’s family is still profiting but not BECAUSE he is president. Biden’s family profited BECAUSE he WAS Vice President!  Do you see the difference?
Actually the virus originated in China, Democrats invented slavery, Biden was against the civil rights act, she did delete the emails, he wasn’t born in the USA, Hunter took the money, he did inhale, Nancy funded terrorists, and you lick windows

Joe Biden Gets Riled Up at Chicago Foreign Policy Talk

Biden calling out Trump for closing off China from coming here ! Pelosi partying and encouraging all Americans to go to their China town and show Trump there’s nothing to fear
Yeah her plan is Biden ! God help us all !!!This is true. But I think what I’m getting at is that you are only going to accept the results if trump wins. If Biden wins you will attribute it to a faulty election. If trump wins it was all fine.
What another lie 😂 66% of Americans disapprove of your handling of the Covid 19 What are you going to run on? How many lies you can tell? I'm sure Senator Sanders people hate your trade I would vote for Biden even if he ran naked on Fifth Avenue At least he could run You can't
Neither will Joe Biden Quit lying 👺 👺👺👺👺 He has said so many times
Translation   My campaign heads prepared for Sanders as an opponent because their forethought is as limited as my administration.   So we have to convince people Biden IS Sanders to scare white people.
If I couldn't hate Trump more He raped a little girl and has gotten away with it He needs to be punished for all the women he's attacked and raped
Wow what a huge lie The Obama Biden presidency got unemployment down from 10% to 5 % Your boss has put us in a worse situation than the great depression Yesterday's GPD was nearly 33% That's worse than any other time in 70 years Tell the truth You really think people are dumb

Biden is not right in the head folks.
You have no intelligence Mr. Biden doubt you had any for the entire 50 years in government. It is a shame that you are being paraded around as if you have a chance in hell of being President. Cheat all you can, still won't be enough.
Its real simple people when you vote, Do you want someone who Protects America &amp; American Values (President Trump) or do you want someone that protects Terrorists &amp; their Anti-American Values (Joe Biden/Obama)

The historic Democrats are gun owning working class. They are the Trump base. Curious to see how the working class dependent upon hourly jobs will vote since Biden supports keeping them unemployed. As those financial pressures crush this group the votes will shift to Republicans.
Biden couldn’t put together a coherent thought. We will all get to see this fact when he finally debates
Joe Biden is sooo radical.

I don't know if Joe Biden WANTS me to start talking shit about him again, but he's acting like he wants me to start talking shit about him again, and it's taking almost all of my willpower not to do that.
“Voting for Joe Biden is like eating half a bowl of shit” may be the best 2020 election quote.
*fewer voters   You misread me. Probably deliberately, as it fits your warped narrative. There is no lesser of two evils here. Biden is good and just and will make a good president. Trump is an unmitigated evil - who you help
I'm sorry but Warren is dull, and that doesn't sell. Joe and Kamala are where it is at
If ur voting for Biden or Trump, u r tripping
So you ensure that Trump wins in November. I don't like Biden either, but when we have a "president" as incompetent as Trump, this is not the time to risk four more years of him just because Biden isn't the best candidate.
No it's not. It would simply siphon votes from Biden and ensure Trump wins a second term, which would be FAR worse than a Joe Biden presidency.
Well said, Judge Pirro!  I'm not a Trump supporter however; I'll take Trump any day over Biden as I don't want to return to the Obama years nor do I believe that Biden is Presidential material.

No more shaming. You accomplish more with your videos online. Focus on what you do best and help us put Biden in the President's office on January 21, 2021
Based on everything you’ve tweeted so far, you are not competent to assess that.   On Election Day, I will hold my head high and in exceedingly good conscience, vote for Biden. I will definitely not cast a masturbatory vote for the ASP goon.

No. Trump is a fascist who is openly and proudly doing fascism and Biden would...presumably not do that.   But both parties ultimately serve the same capitalist interests, and it is ultimately those capitalist interests that need to be defeated. And you can't do that by voting.
Because BLM and Antifa expose and protest decades, if not CENTURIES, of brutality, misconduct, and oppression by police. And they don't actively worship Joe Biden the same way Q supporters worship Trump.
Do you not see how much Biden has evolved
None of which is Donald Trumps fault.  He didn't cause the pandemic, but Comey committed a crime and so did Obama and Biden. Wake up to the truth.

Apparently you missed the point. Hospitalized nurses blew up Biden’s nose to get him to move. Biden said that. Does that sound like an individual who should run this country? That’s the point. We have an election coming up in case you care. #bidendementia
Lol, so says you. While I admit Biden isn't ideal I'd hardly say he sucks like trump does.
A million things made any dem candidate better than Biden. He’s who we got. Sadly. But a weak ass politician is still biggly better than a weak ass ego maniac who doesn’t understand how fucked up it is to tweet a pic from the Oval Office w beans during a pandemic. Cmon man.
I think from Biden the left and right get mad enough that we get away from a 2 party system. If trump wins again I dunno that we ever get back without things getting massively worse.
Look I agree! It’s all crazy. But I don’t like Biden. He was my least favorite dem. I’m not excited about him. I have little interest in defending him. But I know that trump has run us into the ground. And if he wins again I dunno if I can deal with another 4 years.
You still have not defended trump one iota. Oh Biden’s bad. Oh in one of his dozens of protests he said masks. He does denounce some extreme supremacy, kind of. You haven’t even tried defending his general bungling if the pandemic. You can’t.
DIVERT!!! Again, trumps fine cuz others did a bad once. So it’s equal. You got like 5 talking points on Biden. Trump has already turned us into the worlds smelly kid in the present whilst having far worse skeletons
Biden not being a crazy racist, he’s not perfect. He has some skeletons. But served proudly directly under a black man for 8 years. So take the crazy outta there. Trumps niece said he used the n-word regularly like this week. Biden and trump aren’t on the same scale

It’s funny that you didn’t care about Joe Biden being in other woman’s business; literally shoving his hand down their pants It’s disgusting to try to flip that around, your parents raised you better
Joe Biden will fix that problem
I hate when people assume Biden wouldn’t run for a second term.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
If you think Joe Biden is going to pick Bass y’all are either politically inept or just wishfully thinking.
So if she is willing to apologize and not work with the rapist R Kelly, why do you think she shouldn’t apologize for choosing rapist Joe Biden for her sexual assault psa? 🧐 Dont you see how that is a little tasteless? Giving people the impression he is a champion for women?🤢
It was in 2016, and he’s been anti woman’s right to choose since the 80s.... and he fondled children... R Kelly’s takedown was in 2019, DWUW was in 2013.... If she can denounce her work with R Kelly, she can denounce her work with Joe Biden
Worry about fadga denouncing her work with rapist R Kelly, but not rapist Joe Biden 🤢 Karma finally hitting fadga hard😂

Bb it’s your first day in class isn’t it? Maybe sit back and observe before you decide to get brave Again, any comment on why gaga chose a predator over a woman? Confined blackface? Not denouncing joe biden?? Or you gonna keep ignoring 😂
The fact that y’all have absolutely no defense against Gaga choosing a predator over a woman, condoning blackface, denouncing R Kelly, but not Joe Biden, so y’all just stick to getting personal 😂 Lame
That’s not your call, Chucko!  Be careful what you ask for.  You’ll be singing a different tune if Biden has majority votes that night.

Not so much...but BIDEN all the way!✊💚
So why didn’t she denounced Joe Biden, the rapist, like she did R Kelly, the rapist? 🥴 Can’t respond to that can you
You’re talking about DWUW I’m talking about her choosing Biden for her TIHTY performance She did not give “those victims” a platform, she used victims as props 🤢 Maybe she should keep it consistent in the way that she denounced her work with past predators 🥴
Black folks in #Chicago voted for that  "lightweight" blacks need to pull the heads out of your asses and stop traditional voting, do they think Biden going to do something the same person who was in office with a black President
So then where was she when the evidence came out against Joe Biden, lol? Acting like this man isn’t known for publicaly groping little children.....fuck outta here
You point doesn’t stand You can’t claim that she gets a pass for not knowing about Joe Biden when he literally is out there saying shit like this since the 90s 🤡 what a real champion for women
I’m confused because for an artist that came out when I was in middle school like 2008, I’m only 24 and I’m old enough to remember that Fadga chose Joe Biden to introduce her sexual assault collab 🤡 Instead of a woman... TiLl It HaPpEnS To YoU 🥴
She denounced her work with R Kelly, the rapist But not Joe Biden, the rapist? 🥴 What’s the difference?  Why choose a predator for your sexual assault collab instead of an actual survivor or a woman? I’ll wait..... 🤢
I firmly believe she would be a great CoS. Especially because she knows key leaders in Washington and she’s close with Biden. Makes the most sense.
If you believe Joe Biden is going to pick  , I suggest you research her and you’ll see why he’d never pick her.

Her record as prosecutor was fine.   Biden campaign punked out to BLM.
After Biden BAILED on her after her record having a shield came out.
Biden stubborn but not INSANE.   HE CAN'T BE! 😂😂😂
Kamala - just another politician. 👎🏾Rice - a DC lifer. 👎🏾
This is whats Triggering the ambition and loyalty questions.   It's HIS party. Biden called himself an Obama/Biden Democrat and ran on it.
If they ll do Harris like this....Any other black woman isn't exempt.   It's why I was  OPPOSED for so long to a black woman VP.  Biden is a Ed Burke type dem.  I grew up around this shit.
Same. I'm just about done with these crybabies who say they won't vote for Biden unless he picks "their" choice of VP. Joe Biden could pick Vlad the Impaler as his running mate and I'll still vote for him.
I research folks records..... and Biden was only good to block Sanders and Warren.  He did that.   He has no more use to me.
It is very disrespectful how Obama used John Lewis' funeral to urge us aboriginal (misnomer 'Black') people to vote for Biden - the same demon that not only raped women, but also helped in passing the 3 strike laws which further destroyed our families in the 90s under Clinton.
Dems Subpoena Pompeo In Probe Of Senate GOP Biden-Ukraine Disinfo Campaign  via
Obama and Biden turn their backs on the coal industry  removed the restrictions.
Rep James Clybourn “We do not have a national strategy to combat the Coronvirus. Trump isn’t followings virus exerts like Dr. Fauci, but instead is following a personal political agenda.” We need a President Biden now to enact federal mandates and save lives. VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!
Oh my GOD! 😂😂😂😂  They drunk off polls at the Biden campaign! 😂😂😂
They want LOSE Florida! 😂😂  Biden ALREADY WEAK with Brown voters... you have Brown magazines and publications saying Harris for VP but let's fight about Castro?  In a state where Nelson and Gillum lost because of POOR BROWN SUPPORT with a Latina LG?!
Amy largely wasn't hit outside being a hard ass boss.   I pushed Biden Klobuchar HARD for months after Harris dropped out because I didn't want black women treated by a 1960s Democrat in Biden and his orbit this way.
Why did he apologize to black voters in SC.  Because he was wrong.  Again Biden dropped Amy like a hit potato over her record and you think Khive is what sank her VP chances!  Grow up.
Many thanks 45, thanks to you made Joe Biden a shoe in for a Nobel. Don't be mad you sold your soul for money not for a peace maker. You said you love chaos and there is no Nobel for chaos. Fool.
That's all this is.  They want The VP front runner to be humble and loyal to Biden and the Obama brand.   That's politics.
He had to apologize!😂😂😂  Joe Biden doesn't do that much.   No remorse... that's Dodd talking for Joe and Jill.   Apparently he felt his dog whistle wasn't wrong because Obama made him his WWC insurance after Hillary bust his ass with white no college in the 08 primary.
It seems Biden's campaign diesnt think that   Bass is a black Warren! 😂😂  That's all.
Privileged is thinking Biden will be  much different.  The working class will barely survive 4 more years of either as president.
Benghazi will NOT HURT RICE.  Castro can HURT Biden in Florida.
11. With so many people unemployed, they actually had time to stand in line all day at the polls.  12. Maybe one polling place for all of Kentucky was too much.  13. The Russians were really helping Biden.  14. Those phony mail-in ballots from China got stuck at customs.
So either way, it’s a win/win for the country. He’s yanked out kicking and threatening people and Pelosi or Biden are in charge.
Come November they'll accuse Biden of being a Muslim, being a satanist, and of eating babies in a ritualistic Catholic ceremony.
So everyone does bribery why not us!? Do you not see how that is how we got to Trump in the first place!? The Dems are supposed to be on the side of the people. Neoliberals normalize bribery and we wonder how we got Biden..
Oh me too man, I’m going to do another collection just between Khive Biden Bro’s and Bernie Bro’s. I’ll tag you when I post it.
If you were at a sandwich shop and 3-5 out of 10 of every customer you see there looks at the menu, doesn’t like the options and turns around. You would be blaming the customer. That’s all your doing here. Biden bro’s slogan is “Biden, if you don’t like him, well fuck you”
Feel like I’d like Joe Biden a lot more if he wrote his own tweets. It’s really the least he could do.

Of what? Joe Biden? 😹
How I miss our President, his morals, courage, and leadership. God help us find a way to have such leadership in the near future. Vote Biden 2020!
Bidens America?!?!? Trump is President right now!!! Its bc of him... not biden you uncultured swines.
Four years ago, they had it easy. Hillary Clinton had 30 years of hate to tap into. But Biden is a well-respected public figure. And since hate is the right's most potent tool, they have to make this election about other GOP boogeymen to keep the base scared.
Yeah, Biden is way more popular than Clinton ever was.
The way I see it, both groups, those who don't normally vote, and those who stayed home in 2016, have to be reached out to with equal fervor. Not just Sanders supporters. A lot of Black Obama voters stayed home in 2016, too. Biden's now popular than Hillary was, though.
The democrats straight up used a a funeral as an opportunity for Obama to give a speech they wish Joe Biden could give
What if Joe Biden picks a Black woman as his VP and on his second day in office, he resigns...not due to scandal or health concerns, but bc it's representative of what needs to happen in our country
They are probably lining up because after January 20th when Joe Biden becomes President, no one will remember who Pence is!
Does Biden have precogs on his team? Or maybe just some good psychologists who cab game out a narcissist while losing. Either way, he was right.

I’m not sure why everyone is so down on Joe Biden. He’s a perfectly reasonable Republican candidate.
#TrumpPresser :  fact check:  Biden does not want a fracking ban, he want to stop NEW permits.  Trump lied, things are NOT better in Fl.  He said he wants to stop evictions....there is nothing in the GOP bill addressing that.  No evidence of voter fraud.  #TrumpLies
And here's the thing. If Sanders was the candidate right now, I'd be fighting just as hard for him as I am for Biden. Politics is about compromise. There's no room for "I'm taking my ball and going home."
So will they call for a do-over on the judges and justices when Biden is elected? Otherwise, this means nothing.
On top of all the tweets from #45 about how Biden is a puppet of the "Radical Left," I've also been seeing tweets saying this election is "really" Trump vs. Obama, Trump vs. China. I think #45's party has realized they can't win against Biden.
I saw tweets from Progressives yesterday that have me worried. They said, in a nutshell, that Biden has to "earn" their vote by agreeing to progressive policies. I'm not telling them how to vote, but do they really think 4 more years of #45 is the right way to stick it to Biden?
Biden’s main excuse for backing the 94 Crime Bill is the support it had from the Congressional Black Caucus. Those members, which includes the late Congressman Lewis, were just as responsible as Clinton, Pelosi and the rest for laying the foundation for mass incarceration.
Why do all the Jews support democrats? Trump has done more for Israel than any other President. Biden is Catholic not a big Jew supporter. Blacks hate Jews, his VP will be black. Wake up Jews vote Trump!
You're clearly a Racist.... Supporting racist Biden.

Learned this during Obama’s second term when I realized he could easily avoid doing the work if he placed blame for the work not being done solely on his opponents. Same playbook Trump is using today and Biden will use if he wins.
Mr. Turley:  Joe Biden did nothing more than predict EXACTLY what is happening.  Trump wants to postpone the election.  Whether he can or not is irrelevant; even proposing it is yet another step towards authoritarianism.  You should apologize.
I'm SUPER looking forward to your tweet apologizing to Joe Biden and condemning Trump for doing EXACTLY the opposite of what you said.  Can't wait.
It might seem counterintuitive but for my sanity I have to assume Trump will win. I can’t be surprised by that again.  Intellectually and objectively it is FAR more likely Biden will.
Biden called him xenophobic because he was. Not because he stopped some (but all) travel from China.
I can teach you how to google. But in the meantime here is an elaborate description of why your statement is mostly false
Are Dems going to blame mail-in voting errors when Biden loses??
But all this to say, Joe Biden is the candidate precisely to not so subtly appeal to white nationalism in the Republican playbook, perhaps sincerely to get Lincoln Project adjacent conservatives on board. The Green Party even rigged their primary to placate the white nationalists
I say Kamala Harris will be Biden’s VP pick.   She’s obviously a horrible candidate but she’s the safest choice for Vice Puppet    Who agrees?
AOC and Biden and other demonKKKRats use "y'all"  and "ain't" to pander to black voters. "They gone put y'all back in chains".  "Ain't nothin' wrong with being a bartender".
delusional human beings. here's a guy that was the worst president in the history of America and destroyed our country in 8 years. brought it to its knees and the economy. what a failure. along with that mental case old man Joe Biden who's not even fit to run Burger King 🖕🏾
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party | US elections 2020 | The Guardian
Nothing will stop me from voting in November for Biden!!!
“Mr. Trump has no authority to unilaterally change the date of the election, which is set by federal law.”
I do also very much buy that Biden is a guy who wants someone he can "eat lunch with" and Rice is the only one of the major contenders he already has a strong relationship with.
And people think Warren has a chance. This is how you end up with Tim Kaine. Or Al Gore. Or Joe Biden.
Ohio is a waste of time for Biden. Personally I’d go for Georgia. Two senate races and it hedges a loss of Wisconsin/PA
This is why people gotta stfu with their “I will dance in the streets on Nov 4!” and “X days until Biden’s inauguration!”  Stay on HIGH alert for fvckery. This is nowhere near over.
Don’t blame them. Kamala is just another politician.
No, please no. Rice is a Washington lifer through and through. I can’t  see her being any more popular than Hillary.
Look, Trump is a dumb as a box of rock. Everything that is coming out of his administration is from the racists, Nazis, fascist, lap dogs of Putin. Trump is there just to sign his name.   Biden VP pick is of little importance, being in the room where it happens, polices, laws, is

Instead of complaining of Biden and the Democrats not having a black agenda try coming up with one where 90% of registered black voters and all the black fraternities, sororities, black churches, black organization, black professionals, &amp; black civil rights organization can do
Facts over your fake woke feelings!   Thank you  for this!
Husband and I have both requested mail in ballots. We will be voting for Biden as soon as they arrive and then dropping them off at our early voting facility on day one. Can’t wait!
If it's any consolation she will go on the trash heap along with Sarah Palin and Geraldine Ferraro when Biden gets destroyed in November.
What if instead of Senator Warren, Harris, or Stacy Abrams Joe Biden chose Julian Castro or Cory Booker?
I think her foreign policy record is complicated, but it is long. By political, you really mean electoral. Though, while never elected Rice has substantive experience in the Clinton/Obama administrations. Also, out of everyone in the running Rice is the closest to Biden.
should be ambitious and looking toward becoming the President.  Biden WILL be a one term President.  If white women can’t be ambitious what chance do women of color have to be ambitious?
We are in a #Coronavirus  black hole that will get larger &amp; by Nov there will be 500K Dead.  Trump will be mumbling #hydroxycholoroquine until the day they drag him out of the WH.  On Day 1 Joe Biden will unleash the power of the USA &amp; a new dawn begins.  Cue the🌞🌞☀️

The difference is Biden views may have changed and Donald Trump are unbelievable and still unchanged. You are not a human being and Trump has one black person in his white supremacy team that so UnAmerican !History of racism out weighs Biden History of racism .Who’s more American
When I think of Joe Biden I think of one of thousands of Young black men that got caught up in Clinton and Biden crimeBill that  state BLM kids to be predators without a hand of restorative justice until now. Why should I vote for Biden  now? When I wasn’t a predator then or now?
Biden is too high in the White Votes, he’s been trying to knock it down.  Next time he will wear his KKK outfit screaming  MAGA.
My excitement level regarding Biden is like 0.4/10 but I would love to have a president that isn’t openly racist and cares more about curbing the pandemic than reminding us where it came from

1st of all not sure who you’re talking to but you’re not in charge of other’s thoughts or opinions, this is my post, so beat it. 2nd talking points and political phrases are common, reminders about personal feelings on possible VP , says something about Biden.

Raise your hand if you think if Biden’s elected, Trump will refuse today leave the White House.

The problem with Biden unlike Trump is he brings allot of political badgage with him. Good or bad it is allot.  It is too bad they could not find a more center person with trumps political experience. The biggest problem we have are these career politicians.
like yeah the military is so scared of Joe Biden giving them a blank check every year that they’ll back a fucking coup. grow up and start phone banking
I didn't know why the American Dream eluded me until  educated me.  My mother has passed on but she thought Warren was a sensational lady.  #Democrats a Biden and Warren #Election2020 ticket can be our moment &amp; time.  #Biden2020 #BidenWarren
Also, I think we both know that Biden is most likely not going to be one in charge.  His  VP most likely will be....his VP is going to be even more on the left than he is...
As, to Bernie supporters not supporting Biden.  I hope that's the case, I hope they not that stupid to actually support him.  However there's graph based on his platform vs Trump's platform that shows that  Biden moved significantly more to the left than Trump to the right.
Here comes Biden/Whitmer
I'm struggling like the rest of you. Our president has no compassion he has no empathy because he never has. Let's bring America back around to the progressive nature that we were headed to. United we stand divided we fall. We will not be divided or subjected to communism. Biden!
Why don't you explain why you think Biden would do better than Trump with the economy and for Black Americans?
Actually,  Joe Biden is pretty left right now..on his policies. Federal National gun ban is NOT centrist policy,  it's leftist policy.  Wouldn't you say so?
It’s amazing how bernie Bros will construct false narratives about biden but not actually chime in here. Actually... not amazing. Just deeply, and expectedly, hypocritical.
Are you insane? 150k people are dead! The economy is wrecked. Child poverty is somehow getting even fucking worse!  And you're sitting here perpetuating some bs about Biden's cognitive ability before the first debate?
There could be countless volumes written about the absolutely tremendous political opportunity the Democratic Party seems so intent on squandering in this historical moment.  Biden has no idea who his allies are or what they’re fighting for.
And so many of the field would love round 2 without those three B’s in the race. Bernie with his 25%, Bloomberg’s money and Biden’s name
‘It's absolutely serious’: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap  via
Biden won’t get us there and I’m worried his win will bring more complacency. Dnc fucked around and we promised they would find out. If we ring empty on that promise, we are asking for more of the same neoliberal bullshit.
And with Biden, he don’t need no education. He’s not wet behind the ears like Obama or Bill Clinton.
My guess is they pre-wrote it and included a placeholder Biden quote where the real one would go. I find it hard to believe Biden would give Politico the script, unless maybe it was leaked? Who knows.
As the President is currently pushing this drug that has been proven it wont cure Covid! But yeah Biden is wrong! Yeah ok Spicey!
The Democratic party's entire strategy this cycle is to tell you to vote for Biden because he's not Trump. This is their shield to block any discussion of progressive issues. Reminds me of when Republicans would merely shout 9/11 anytime they were challenged.
👍🏽 Andrew Yang's quiet campaign for Joe Biden
I was on the selection committee and this was the #1 reason you were chosen. Biden also loves your podcast.

Something I've been thinking about lately. Looking at all these false claims #45 has been making about Joe Biden. I get a feeling that his tactic is going to be to swamp Biden with false claims that he's forced to deny, leaving almost no time to state his own views on things.
What’s the point of polling Mass for Biden vs Trump? May as well poll Red Sox vs Yankees
This is why Biden will lose. He’ll blame everyone and everything but this is the reason. It’s obvious.
If Biden wins that will be #1 talking points. How are we going to deal with the massive deficit the Democrats have. It will be like they have amnesia from what happened in the last 4 years of the Dump.
“Judicial” committee? Democrat members are previewing Biden Admin KANGAROO COURT procedures, where guilt and sentencing are predetermined by identity- race, sexuality, relationship to Joe Biden... no testimony needed. If  doesn’t win, this is what we’ll get.

Me leaving the voting booth in 98 days. I seriously cannot wait to vote for #biden and end this nightmare
Biden seems to have learned the lesson of GOP obstructionism during the Obama years. They've been making noise that they won't let anything slow them down if the Dems have the majority on the Hill.
Also, fwiw, Biden is not running as far left as Warren or Sanders would have been, but his platform will still make the country tangibly better.  Bankruptcy reform, his housing policy, childcare funding--all of those will be good for Americans.
Why are peoplw tearing their hair out because the DNC platform dowsnt endorse Medicare for All? I'm in favor of it, but Biden didn't support it and won the primary by a wide margin. Of course it's not gonna be in the platform.
Conservatives understand Biden would be worse.
SHE SHOULD KEEP WORKING ON HER HOOKER MAKE-UP! SHE WON’T BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY A NEW GARDEN. BIDEN MIGHT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEN THE GARDEN WOULD GET DUG UP &amp; MONEY WASTED. SHE SHOULD JUST START PACKING.

You said “ANY republican” not, “any republican that can win” trust me, there’s a lot worse than Trump. Honestly, he’s not even a conservative any more than he’s a Neo-Facist. Honestly, Joe Biden is more of a Conservative IMO. We’ve seen the Overton window move so durastically
Joe Biden potentially picking Karen Bass as his running mate cuz that's what we need right now, a Karen in the White House 🤦🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️😂
Honestly, this is so strategic.  doing an  VP tease on 7/31 + will likely raise a sh*t ton of money going into August. It is a win, win for the eventual Biden-? team. As much as I love the sound of Vice President Warren, I think it will be someone else.
this is called the act of thwarting hedonic adaptation: by imagining a future without Biden as Prez, we gain clarity on how badly we need him in office — as well as how much better our lives will be when Trump is donezo.
Prefer Obama Ebola Czar  lawyer? Who said they got “lucky” with H1N1 that infected 50M people? Who let people with Ebola into the country to spread it here? Who quit before a vaccine? Who touts Joe Biden for wearing a mask on May 25 after CDC screwed testing? Lies?:
1) New Zealand stopped China travel best. Trump tried, Biden cried, you/Pelosi lied, more died 2) Biden CDC test plan was disaster, Trump gave US most tests on earth 3) Trump said wear mask.. April 3; Biden.. May 25?! 4) Biden said nothing on nursing homes! 5) Lies: HCQ and this-Does POTUS understand these protests and civil unrest are happening on his watch?  He claims a Biden presidency will result in chaos?  WTF is going on right now?
Yes. Will vote Biden
Those toxic Biden Bros at it again.
I hate that we have to vote for Biden cause there’s nobody better
Don’t stoop. I got the finger at a stoplight from a trumper because of my Biden sticker. I shrugged. It felt right.
Per the U.S. Constitution, he cannot delay the election! #DicatorTrump is trying to defer and distract the American people from his epic failure of a response to the pandemic with his deployment of federal paramilitary forces into Democratic run cities, and blame Biden and Obama.
How many points do you think Biden's VP choice could swing his current lead over Trump in either direction?  Is 5 % points in play here, given this will likely be the defacto Dem nominee in 2024? #ithinkthatsright
Biden isn't picking his running mate. I'm not sure he knows what year it is. His running mate will be hand picked by the DNC.
Biden only cares about his donors. Just be honest. Biden is not a good person. Biden has never been a good person
There won’t be a debate unless Biden feels he’s losing &amp; has to do it. right now Bidens not feeling the heat so he’ll make up some excuse to avoid having to go toe to toe with the President.
I love how every Trumper is an expert on Joe Biden’s daily activities and his mental health

Without a single solid doubt, this is the most disgusting, disrespectful, and disgraceful thing that I have seen on Twitter! These idiotic Trump supporters, wearing swastikas as face masks, say, "A vote for Joe Biden = a vote for Nazis." Totally disgraceful to America!
Speaking of polls, here’s one from your friends at Fox ..  Polls:  #Michigan: Biden 49% (+9) Trump 40% #Pennsylvania: Biden 50% (+11) Trump 39% #Minnesota: Biden 51% (+13) Trump 38%.                                 Any comment?  Didn’t think so. Facts aren’t your thing.

She fights the good fight everyday!! Vote Biden so she can walk away when she wants to.  #VoteBlueForRBG
Seriously, the “too ambitious to be VP” stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden and his allies should really drop the whole he'll never meet with Maduro line if he chooses tankie, Karen Bass, as VP.  Or is he just being literal with this because he'll just send VP Bass down to Caracas for a "We Love Maduro" pep rally.
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
A person of character would apologize for this.
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn’t be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
This is really sad. I don’t like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
This is failure on many levels including failure to recognize China as a threat. Mr. Biden, China must be held accountable. An investigation is a must! China must pay, what’s your policy?
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Oh dear, Joe Biden wrong for moms?  I don’t think so. Most moms teach their kids to be honest and kind, listen to experts, be of service to others and respect women and people of color...like Joe does. Not like our liar-in-chief.
I’m wearing my Tweet less, Listen More Biden for President tee shirt.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
Biden is beyond tweeting. He can actually speak in real, understandable, words
Joe Biden doesn’t need to stay up all night incoherently tweeting. He’d rather sleep so he can READ HIS BRIEFINGS in the morning and keep America safe and informed.
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Is Biden allowed to run for president still?  Then, we are not Venezuela.
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"
Can Biden still run for president?  Great!  Then we do not live in a dictatorship unlike Venezuela where the opposition cannot run in elections.
Following all too! Thank you Pati👏🏾💪🏾
Awesome group of resisters, followed all that were new to me. Thank you. Please follow back
That’s true, your right and I like your pony. but Biden is still a disappointment. And he looks like a puppet out of some weird political si-fi movie. You can’t disagree with that.
Where do Biden’s top VP candidates stand on Israel?
Mr. Cain was a great man. And even today he could beat Joe Biden in a debate!
Yes, that's why the four polls showing Biden's leads increasing are in one tweet, and the two polls showing his leads decreasing are in the other. They do this every time, too -- look back.  I'm right, silly. :-)
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
This is a brilliant take. I bet this is where the VP search lands -- the candidate who would be best-positioned to insulate Biden (and Obama).
Looking forward to "I once again vastly overestimated the President. I apologize and now acknowledge that the man is a fascist lunatic, and that Mr. Biden's prediction was not in fact "over the line," but tremendously prescient."  That's what you're writing, yes?
We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Time for a new revolution.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
Ohio elected Sherrod Brown. With the right message, Biden can win it.
Enough about Biden, let's talk Kanye.
I think Barr will try to arrest Susan Rice in September when "Dunham Report" (sp?) for unmasking Carter Page comes out; Barr will allege illegal spying. It will be a circus. Susan looks too depressed to me. Resting sad face. Biden has to pick Kamala.
Biden for president of the nursing home
100% ABSOLUTELY. Yang made it clear.  1. Biden is one term. So 2024 is an open election. 2. Biden will put Yang in his Cabinet.  This will help Andrew overcome his greatest weakness. Executive experience in DC. He'll see, How the sausage is made." 3. Yang will build connections.
If she was 7 years old he would be a Biden voter.
So you mean that we are going to get support for the "mesita" under Biden and support for fake parliamentary elections where the real opposition cannot run.
I don't know.  I think Maduro thinks Biden wins and is waiting for that.  Although he is humoring the EU because the fake opposition has been a bust (I'm not sure if you saw the story about the lack of candidates), he cannot promote some sort of rebellion among the "base."
Trump Isn’t Serious About Russia. But Neither Is Biden. - Noah Rothman, Commentary Magazine
I'd be really concerned, if I were the Amish, about Biden's pledge to make all new vehicles electric.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.
Look to the City of South Milwaukee when results come in. Clinton won it only by a point as it swung against her compared to Obama's 2012 margin and Evers only won by 2. Biden would like to get a 5 point win or better, while Trump would love to pull out a win here. 6/6
This is a region were Biden will want to continue to build on Clinton's 11 point lead here and get closer to Senator Baldwin's win of 15 points, while Trump would love to get close to only losing by around Walker's 7 point margin. 5/6
Fuck, hes gonna make me vote for Joe Biden.
We need Bernie, but corporate democrats won’t let us have him. So now the choices is nazi Russian agent end of democracy. Or Joe Biden so I will take him.
This feels like noise, from a pollster that infamously pulls low numbers for Biden. The NC shift is weird though given other pollsters showing NC being much more deadlocked and these other states far less close. Throw it into the averages I guess.
I don't think a soft touch will work.  What I've been arguing Biden should do is get tough on Maduro like the EU finally did.  Diplomatic/ economic pressure from EU, even weak sanctions, is worth a lot more than with Biden because Maduro expects them to bless his frauds.
Maduro isn't going to be willing to actually negotiate anything unless he feels cornered and he thinks Biden is going to throw them a lifeline.  I do hope that they can get more aid into the country but other than that, there is nothing to be done.
I agree that they need to be working out something but unfortunately things are on hold right now until the November elections in the US.  If Biden's advisors would repudiate elections, then things might open up but the useful idiots at WOLA are already pushing for the farces
Followed all. Thanks again Chloe.
I'll still vote for progressive candidates in Dem primaries and I'll likely begrudgingly vote for Biden but honestly it's so damn frustrating.
Does Biden have any idea what an anarchist is?
If you saw Barr’s hearing and trump’s Covid presser today and are still hanging on who the VP pick is going to be before you decide who to vote for you’re an idiot...  I’m with you  ... Biden no matter who! #VoteBlueLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt Because it does.
I am showing Biden’s tweet to my friends of color that are doctors (2 of them ) , nurse , and a chiropractor. They will laugh in his face for this degrading tweet .
Who said “Tell Vladimir that it will be easier working with him after the election” in that hot mic moment? Hint—Biden’s best friend. Who did nothing when Russia violated the INF treaty, who ridiculed Romney in the debates for saying that Russia was our greatest threat? Same!
Thank you Chloe!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica
As disappointed as I am I would rather have the Biden team calling the shots than the Trump team.
I’m a Warren dem and I am absolutely voting for Biden.  Whether she’s on the ticket or not.  This is some Russian Troll Farm bullshit right here.
Sure, but how much more wide of a net are the casting with Harris in terms of voters to the left of Biden?
Biden comes to power late Jan. Announces a national lock down in Feb. Second March in a row in quarantine.
Sorry but someone must have written this for Biden.
This is very much fluff.  I'd like to know what Biden's specific proposals are on Venezuela.  Does he consider Falcon and the "mesita" to be opposition?  Would he push for the opposition to organize and vote in favor of the "mesita's" candidates in parlimentary elections?
What if Biden has to use complete sentences?
The United States private sector will produce a vaccine or treatment. Obama, Biden or Clinton would’ve run all of this through the CDC and we would be so much further behind.
The dems has debates from January through the end of February. 18 people. The virus was mentioned zero times. Trump was taking measures he was mocked for by Biden and Pelosi
I knew it. I knew Biden was no better than trump when it comes to arresting protesters. It’s the same shit in different suits
There isn't anyone from a swing state who could provide what he needed. I'm almost positive this won't be an all white ticket. So no Warren. I'd love susan rice but she has baggage. And I promise you Biden knows who got him thru the primaries so it will probably be a black woman.
aside from being biden boy and politics, i love finneas sm honestly
Why was your network afraid to air the Biden press conference live?
won’t even show Biden’s press conference live on now. They must fear the gaffs he is making.
Does Biden consider the "mesita" to be "opposition"?  Because I can never get a clear denunciation of those charlatans from left-leaning foreign policy types and IMO that is the key question on Venezuela.
Yep.  I just added a thread to this on my profile.  The issue with the Biden administration is that people like Rhodes and Rice would be in it and they are stupid enough to fall for Fal$on's BS lies.
The issue I have with Biden is I think that he'll throw Guaido under the bus and do some sort of deal with Maduro.  The administration would be subtle about it and promote the "mesita" and their non-existent electoral solution over Guaido.  Fal$on would get the DC meetings. 2/?
I see alot of Venezuelans for Joe Biden arguing that Biden will be better on Venezuela because he'll do a better job coordinating with the allies and getting EU sanctions.  This would be an outstanding argument if I felt that Biden was going to continue to support Guaido. 1/?
There’s plenty that would be inconvenient to remember about the Obama administration’s role in the Russia-collusion investigation, writes
It is perfectly safe to send kids back to school in Illinois, especially my area of Illinois.  I gave you the stats.  Why are you using the kids as a prop against Trump?  I expected more of Biden to be honest.
I want Biden to speak in favor of school reopenings and against virtual learning garbage.
Nina and Cornel are ass 🤡
Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’
Not a good look. What do we get for Biden? Nothing only that trump will be gone.
I love your comparison to shit and voting for Biden
This is not Biden's America.
We will never hear from Joe Biden again after his concession speech on November 3rd
will i ever meet biden boi
Agrees. Ironically, Biden's expectations are lower than Trump's for debate, so more upside here than people think for Joe.
IL-10: The Tenth is a light red district that includes parts of McHenry, Kane, Lake, and DuPage counties. After losing to Sean Casten in 2018, a Biden midterm allows Pete Roskam (R-Wheaton) to return to the Hill. 14/
Let's peek into a potential (and extremely unlikely) Illinoisan future. It is June 2021, and Joe Biden's vice president Tammy Duckworth has left a vacant Senate seat. Running off of her suburban appeal after defeating Randy Hultgren in the 14th district and her 1/
🙄. This is based on zero evidence. All evidence shows that the middle is falling behind Biden and Democrats. John Kasich was even discussed as being a speaker at the DNC! This tweet is nonsense.
When looking at the vote change map you can see how Evers did better almost everywhere in Kenosha County. Biden will want to either copy or improve upon Evers' performance. 4/5
You've lost your mind supporting Biden who doesn't know what's up or down and what's right or left. You are a pathetic performer who has had her best days decades ago. American's feel sorry for you! Get a backbone and stand for truth! Biden is false &amp; lies!
Noam Chomsky makes the point That is bad as Biden is, he will still be easier to move to the left
Over 1 million Muslims have been locked up in Concentration camps for  simply practicing their religion in China and joe Biden and the left continually Defend and back China up this is very wrong  #MuslimLivesMatter #China #Trump2020Landslide
Let’s see what Joe Biden does when he loses?
What happens if Joe Biden refuses to accept election results?
omg good job biden boi!!!!!1
I don’t care who Biden’s picks. Every Republican needs to be voted out. Over 146,000 Americans are dead because of their incompetence.
There is no reason to have remorse.  This is the very reason she’s a strong candidate.  Biden isn’t going to want someone who backtracks.  He wants someone with a spine who stands by her words.
I’m 100% certain Biden heard what Kamala said to him on the debate stage and she still made his short list of VPs.   This is politics. He’s not looking for a VP who is going to stand next to him and just nod and smile.  Wake up, people!
It is good that the Norwegians met with Guaido's group, not with the bozos of the mesita.  A more realistic fear than the EU or Biden endorsing Maduro outright is them endorsing Maduro's dingbat pawns as the real opposition.
Aging and diminished joe Biden. Lolz. Have you people seen or listened to trump?
How to take seriously an article that calls Joe Biden who is clearly in much better shape than trump aging and diminished.
And they are coming for the suburbs.  Law introduced by Obama &amp; Biden, but POTUS refused to enforce.  Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, or AFFH.  Using this law as and add-on to HUD, O'Bidens plan to invade suburbs. Take over local Government of towns, cities and burrows.
refuse to account, will be denied state &amp; Fed assistance, like education and roads.  Feds will force communities to build multi dwelling, low income buildings, at your expense.  They will outlaw single family homes as White privilege.  This is Socialism!  This is Biden's plan.
If Joe Biden doesn’t pick a PoC as a running mate he will squander a unique historical opportunity. It’s time.
Under-discussed point Democratic governors in key states could help Biden. Less voter surpression in NC, PA, WI &amp; MI. And those states don’t need much to flip. If Cooper is winning by a wide margin easier to see Biden doing well in NC.
Apparently having questions about Biden's foreign policy views makes me a moron...  Shut up and drink the Koolaid.
I was hoping that Biden would gently repudiate Obama's sh*t foreign policy because he had always been more of a realist compared to the absolute naive garbage pumped out by Obama/ Rice like being "nice" would make bad guys like Iran and Cuba like us.. but guess not.
I could vote for neither...  How about that choice?  All I know is that J. Guaido and all the freedom fighters in Venezuela are screwed if Susan Rice gets to direct foreign policy just like they were screwed under Obama.  Sad because I thought better of Biden.
I'm mail-in voting, but it's Illinois, so something has REALLY hit the fan if Biden doesn't win here.
I cannot vote for Biden if she gets the nod.  That would suggest an endorsement of Obama's worst foreign policy initiatives - Cuba "thaw," Iran deal, etc.
The Lincoln Project wants to convince GOPers to vote for Biden by puffing the architect of Obama sh*tty foreign policy as VP for some reason.
Why?  She was horrible as Obama's NSA.  Do you really want bad deals like sucking up to the Castros to be on the table during Biden's presidency?
The issue is that Trump is capricious and changes his whims.  In this regard, Biden would be better.  The issue with Biden is his unwillingness to play "bad cop" and press for a solution.
The federal government doesn’t fund the police.
The best part is that the people standing around aren knocked over...just the wall
So you are telling me that if I vote for Biden, the sanctions are going to be stronger and the troops are going to be staged in Colombia ready for an invasion?  Because that isn't the vibe I am getting.
Biden will never do an interview unless he gets all questions first
Joe Biden will never be heard from again after his concession speech
The difference between Trump and Biden is one of them knows what he doesn’t know and what he should hand off to others.. The other is a fucking moron ( Credit to Tillerson)
Whew.. I was concerned Biden would defund police.. Guess I will switch my vote back to Biden.. PS only Trumpsters believe that shit
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made max donation to Socialist.Marxist/Democrat Joe Biden?  No surprise.  NBA depends on China for a billion fans &amp; cheap merchandise.  Merchandise produced by slave labor, minority group Uyghurs.  Ironic,BLM supports slave labor?  Joe supports China.
You do realize Biden shitting himself is a very real possibility?
Will Hillary replace Biden.  #Biden2020 #hillary #Trump2020
Biden still hasn’t said Dickie mcGeezaks about what happened in Portland Kyle Kulinski
#CognitivelyThere can Biden say: ” Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV?” He doesn't need to. He's busy with plans to clean up Trump’s mess and end Corona Virus.
Socialist/Marxist/Democrats want to overthrow our Republic and Capitalism, for Socialism &amp; Marxism.  NBA Teams and merchandise, heavily invested in CHINA.  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, just  made max donation to O'Biden.  Hunter Biden made 411 trips, to 29 foreign countries,
Twitter buzz or hot takes don’t translate into votes - Biden under-estimated &amp; the left hasn’t processed why they lost
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.                                                                DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
A Joe Biden cabinet would be center right not left wing
Biden would have the same as Barack Obama’s administration. That wasn’t a left wing progressive administration. What kind of Supreme Court picks would we get from the guy who voted for Clarence Thomas?
Joe Biden wanted a police bill of rights in the 1990’s do you think he’s changed
He can beat Biden off? Ewww.
Virtual phone banking. Donated to Biden. Visibility with bumper sticker and Biden Tee Shirt.
How do we know Joe Biden would do the opposite?
#FACTCHECK  The Committee to Defend #realDonaldTrump has been running a misleading #Facebook ad campaign targeting older voters in #NorthCarolina that twists #Biden words to brand him a #racist.   The ad inaccurately claims that Biden praised KKK members
It seems like Mesa, who seems like the "Joe Biden" of Bolivia is going to win in a walk (but things can easily change.)  People want boring, adult centrism.
...what on earth are you talking about? What candidate? Joe Biden? A person widely considered a rapist and racist among the progressive movement?
Yup. Plus Operation Overtake Blue Cities and things of that nature.  Goal would be to make Biden so busy on Day One that he has to spend 48 hours straight signing EOs to undue the EOs that Trump signed. SCOTUS would be busy, Congress wouldn't do much, it will be nuts.
Look at these people. Biden voters. Imagine aligning with them. Jfc.
Dukakis was good man but had the magnetism of an old shoe. Biden far more charismatic, likable, fun, despite age. And perfect antidote to Trump. Much better story.
Biden will be 46, and the USA will be Germany '46.
This is from tonight. All Biden voters.   Pretty easy decision for most.
Mr. Biden, what’s your policy on China?  Your son worked for China for several years, how can you be tough on China? China did not roll out the red carpet for president Obama. China wants you to win because the words are you can be bought with a price. Please show a strong policy
Biden voters
Not sure this changes anything. Talk to voters. Highlight Trump’s failures; Biden’s compassion. Win at the ballot box-Priorities. If  wants to skip the inauguration, so be it. First Lady Jill Biden can toss his sorry ass onto #BlackLivesMatterPlaza . Bye, Felicia.
All I know is he supports Joe Biden and he has since the primary started
Biden would have saved over 146,000 American lives.
What sane person would vote for Trump in 20.  If they despise Biden so much then bounce Trump for a stable mature Republican alternative.Biden's AG? 🤔🤔
At the start of the year I would've said Trump, but after the whole pandemic debacle I can see Biden winning.
I think Biden will be announced the winner before California, Arizona, Washington, Nevada, Oregon, New Mexico and Colorado close. Oh, those states and probably Texas too all go Biden.
Florida is usually fast with results, and they get a ton of absentee ballots normally.  If Biden is looking like he's getting a win there, then we know its over.
Fauci and Biden gon be the first ones in 😂
Hopefully, no.  I don't talk politics to my nephew, who's a couple hours away.  I prefer to think he's seen the light and is voting Biden.
She shares the same memory issues Biden has...
Yea he set the precedent and Biden did NOTHING about it
If I'm following any of these traitors, they are getting blocked, and anyone else who threatens to put trump back in rather than vote for Biden.  Just become a damn trumpster and STFU.
Don’t like  so I found myself briefly considering voting Biden. I watched about an hour of yesterday’s AG Barr hearing and there is no way in hell I can vote for a Dem. They were all shrieking banshees on that committee
Do I like Trump? Not at all, but I would never vote for Biden. Your organization can’t even be bothered to respond to questions via email. It’s just a front to support Biden. What clowns
Incredible how Dems rush to be apologists for Biden like Republicans do for Trump.
That’s literally one incident they always bring up compared to thousands Biden helped lock up. Even Kanye and his wife helped release some ppl.
Joe Biden will pick Kamala Harris for VP as his running mate. Anybody wanna bet?
I don't trust this.  Too convenient of a reason to cancel the convention so Biden can avoid being seen on a National level
No way that Biden/Bernie tandem wins
Joe Biden set the precedent for White leftists/liberals to determine Black peoples Blackness when they don’t align with their politics.
If you to get off of Biden’s surgeries and think about who we need as a country: compassionate, able to consider other’s ideas, kind, friendly,capable, experienced and a just plain like able good person able to work with others for the common good vs: unable to consider other’s
Somebody just posted a Biden/Sanders unity plan for the presidency. I’m done😂😂😂😂😂
Democrats and Biden have nothing to do with lawless behavior a Trump will fix it on his watch correct?
Actually his delegates have minds of their own. Maybe you should be telling Biden to put #MedicareForAll on his platform.
I remember waking up the day after trump was elected and crying in disbelief and dread.  Waking up to Biden being president will be like constant sunshine and peace!
Do the Biden’s even play tennis?
How so?  Trump has not led in the polling average over Biden at any point, even pre-COVID.  In January Biden was winning.  In July, Biden is winning by more.  Even without the pandemic, we were looking at a tossup election, IMO.
I hope that's true. The Democrats are up to something. #Biden is some kind  Managerial candidate. They are so cocky like they already have cheating set up. The real question is what are we going to do, nothing like the lame party usually does. #Trump #PatriotsAwakened #voterID
Party!!
Dumb mentality to have that one man can change the American scene just like that. Especially not with no damn Joe Biden😭🤦🏽‍♂️
Joe Biden is the definition of fatigue.
Okay...you are NEXT... After Biden.
Outagamie, WI.  Fox Valley is one of the few suburb-ish reservoirs where Biden can make gains to offset R-trending rural areas
Agree totally.  If Biden wins FL by 13, then we're looking at an epic rout that includes wins in TX and GA and OH and IA, and probably a close race in SC. Fun to think about?  Yes.  Do I buy it at this point? It's hard to.
Imagine thinking Joe Biden is your savior lmao
The senior swing towards Biden is real, and it's nationwide.  By extension that helps him even more in FL.  But plus 13?  It would have to be a senior rocketship.
I believe it in that Biden is ahead.  But if the election were today, I'd expect a margin more like Biden +4, give or take.
Biden is winning, but man this falls into the category of "maybe a little too good to be true".
If that is the case then their national polling is even more hilarious.  There is absolutely ZERO chance that Biden's lead in Ohio is larger than his nationwide lead.The Freedom Pub - Biden’s False Climate Promises -
A person of character would apologize for this.
Biden needs more disinfectant in him that will cure his cognitive decline it is just Science
Mr. Cain was a great man. And even today he could beat Joe Biden in a debate!
Joe Biden knew all along. We have under 100 days left to ensure he wins and restores the soul of America. What will you do today to help?
If my aunt had balls she would be my uncle.  This is the dumbest topic of liberals.  Give it a rest.  Just go back to supporting joe Biden with your pro liberal agenda.
It’s nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn’t be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.

I've spent my life helping others who don't have a voice. Proudly. Now more than ever we need to scream for equality. For fairness. Get to the polls in November. Vote out hate. Vote for Biden. Help people like me. Because you really might be next. Hugs.
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
There isn't anyone from a swing state who could provide what he needed. I'm almost positive this won't be an all white ticket. So no Warren. I'd love susan rice but she has baggage. And I promise you Biden knows who got him thru the primaries so it will probably be a black woman.
How Caregiving Became More Than Just a Women’s Issue
Nina and Cornel are ass 🤡
Biden has history w/Susan Rice &amp; she’s got the full compliment of foreign experience we need 2 repair relationships w/our allies. She knows how admins work + she’s brilliant, no-nonsense, strong character, etc. We need experience 2 pull us out of this mess.
Father- what do I tell my fellow Catholics who will not vote for Biden because he is pro choice?
JACKASS!He did all kinds of crooked stuff that you would never acknowledge!Including setting up his legally elected Presidential replacement!Three years!Russia?Lawless is how I would describe Obama and many in his camp!While w/Biden you won’t dignify an answer to any questions!!
So he apologized. No one mentions Biden’s MANY problems w/ the truth,holding up a BILLION to Ukraine to fire a prosecutor.And the history of LYING about his schooling along with his lack of accomplishments!This man has been on the wrong side of history his whole damn career!#LIAR
Facts:Biden 50 years in government with 90’sCrime Bill hurt Black People and Family’s all over this country. Against the second black justice in history! The rest of his career is a black hole! Trump? 3 years in government. Most successful President in history! You are the TROLL!
You gotta be kidding! My Five year old could run circles around Biden . He’s a loser, abuser, blackmailer and has been Proven the Biggest LIAR in the history of the senate! Not 3 degrees, not top of class, but near bottom! In short, a corrupt EX-Senator who should stay that way!

John, how much money you putting on Biden to win?
You really are ignorant! You are there because  couldn't run for a 3rd term and Joe Biden chose not to challenge Hillary Clinton!
Because Biden is going to win. We don't want to primary our own parties sitting president. I totally agree with your assessment of her though. She is amazing and relentless. After watching her speech today, I believe she will be the countries 1st female President, but in 2028
This is happening right now during Trump’s term. This is what Trump has created. It’s mind-boggling that dummies like  serve this up as what the country will be like under Biden. This is what the country is like RIGHT NOW!!  11.3.20
Even Jason admitted on TV that he understood Joe Biden was merely pointing out that other Presidents at the very least did not openly display hostility towards POC like Trump does.I really like Karen Bass!!  She seems like she would really fit with Biden!!
Obama didn’t name Biden VP until August 28th
The Focus on the Family founder warned the country about the HORRORS of an Obama presidency in 2008. His concerns didn't pan out.   Now he's saying the same things about Biden.
How does this undermine our national security interest?  Seems the total plan would be in our best interest.  troops get spread out and maybe those other countries will step up and do their fair share.  BTW  the big WRONG message was sent by the Obama  Biden administration.
Obama didn’t pick Biden until August 28th. Twitter just made this search toxic. His timeline is normal

I didn't even notice he wasn't there, guess that is what a Biden presidency will look like.
They have to pick Susan Rice because she has a simple name. Biden will never be able to say “Kamala” right. It will cause too many gaffes.
A reminder: Whenever Joe Biden announces his VP, liberals will be furious it wasn't their first choice, and conservatives will say "Democrats in disarray!" while exaggerating every past blemish on her record.   IGNORE IT. None of it changes how Trump must be defeated.

I seriously have yet to see in ONE Biden flag or bumpersticker and I live in a very liberal town
You have been focused. Focused on Russia. Focused on impeachment. Focused on not having the early travel ban from China. Focused on open borders to let Coronavirus come in from the south. Focused on one thing only. Getting rid of my President. Biden’s hair plugs look better.
He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.
aren’t y’all the reason elizabeth warren stayed in and didn’t endorse biden leading the the end of bernies campaign all because you wanted to be bullies?

Gonna be a landslide, Donnie. Biden is going to trounce you. Be prepared for a YUGE republican loss in November.
Must we pretend there's an invisible barrier that will protect us? I mean, if I have to I'll play along, but it's not fun.  Say Biden wins by a lot. Does anyone think Trump/Barr can't send uniformed guys to Biden's house before the inauguration to arrest &amp; send him to Guantanamo?

I hate that people talk like this. If Donald Trump loses John Roberts will swear Joe Biden in on January 20th and then Trump is a private citizen with no power. The idea that he will stay is ridiculous.
neither of them hit 50%. Biden has hit 50% with 5/7 most recent polls.

Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
There are some blue check accounts who are now saying Joe Biden made this comment. Do better media!
Hey Media! The person who you claim is an “ally” to Joe Biden is someone who has probably donated to the Campaign once! You are really stretching on this story because some of you are acting like this guy is apart of his inner circle.
All that does is concern me who actually is. Who is pulling the strings on the Biden puppet
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
Nah, let Biden remodel it himself.  Trump will be gone before they can even get started.
Obama didn’t pick Joe Biden until August 23rd. The reason why it seems like this taking long is because people especially on this app are making the process incredibly toxic. Like very very toxic.
Well I'd hope Biden's running mate focuses on being president, considering the state of his health

I can’t believe CNBC actually ran that story saying its a Biden ally. Please don’t fall for this crap.
Oh I can not wait for the day you become our next President! My father is still waiting for results of his covid test day 13 at this point results will be useless!  There are so many issues on different levels that need attention but I am confident in you President Biden!
"Too ambitious" is when your Veep is actively trying to poison you.  Other than that, no.  Biden's 77; anyone who accepts that slot has got to be prepared to step up. Senator Harris would suit me just fine.
Republicans can't decide if Biden's going to make medicine too expensive or too free.
You have failed at everything you’ve ever done. Biden warned us SEVENTY FIVE days before you acknowledged the Virus. Step Up, be a man. You’re a boob and 50 Million are unemployed BECAUSE of YOUR GREATNESS.
“Sleepy Biden” sounds Soooo good right now!
My guess is Biden will be a one term President (due to age). Keep a close eye on who the VP choice is.
Biden wouldn’t destroy the environment. Biden would restore our allies faith in our country. Biden would restore the economy (as Clinton and Obama did before him) Biden wouldnt allow the Russians to get away with bounties on American soldiers. I didn’t even say the T word.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
They better come out before the elections. Otherwise, if Biden wins, gets impeached. Now we have Harris as President.
Well, that sucks. Obviously, that makes Putin happy. The only good thing is that a President Biden can reverse this.

Really? Biden to the rescue?
He was there, but he never messed with anyone again after Biden called him a lying dog faced pony
Dumb whataboutism but I'll humor you anyway.  Biden is smart. He'll get elected without having to say anything. Trump is his own worst enemy. He botched a deadly pandemic, our economy and race relations. And he's the biggest d¡CK on the planet.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday he will not be attending memorial services for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis this week. So, we know what’s wrong with Trump. The question is what’s wrong with us? VOTE for a civil society. Vote Joe Biden. Please.
Yes.  That’s how a centrist like Biden won the nomination.  🙄  It never fails reading the replies to Casten’s tweets - new day, same clowns.
1. Masks definitely work. 2. Hydroxychloroquine is very questionable. 3. This virus is serious despite what our dictator says. 4. Trump is far more mentally unstable than Biden. 5. Our constitutional right to peacefully protest is being threatened. You are fake news, sir.
President Susan Rice🤔 I like Joe Biden he is the perfect safe bet for 2020 Especially in this case I look at th VP choice as a presidential choice. The WH is a demanding job Age matters How about a black woman intellectual as president?
Sure, after you destroyed it, Joe Biden will make it great again. Step aside, Donnie.
Something else to consider.
Ugh. So tired of this “What if he doesn’t leave?” argument. If he loses, he ceases to be president on Inauguration Day. If his petulant ass won’t leave the Oval, Biden will have him escorted out by security. Period.
White female Biden supporter here. I’ll be thrilled if Joe chooses a WOC for his VP. If you imagine some kind of “backlash” that says something about you.
By the way polling looks, we may have to thank Mark Kelly for Joe Biden possibly winning AZ. Mark Kelly is constantly outpolling Joe and may pull him over the finish line
I think i found the dumbest Tweet today. If you think Joe Biden is more interested im settling scores than winning an election than you’re delusional.
I can’t see our Country suffering more than it is right now. Biden is not the President. You are!
He’s just playing Biden go seek!
All under your watch. We'll take our chances with Biden. A return to decency

You duped the good people of my home state once.  They don’t like you Donnie.  You’re going down.  PA for Biden!!
That’s what I plan to do by voting for Biden!
Susan Rice actually makes a lot of sense to be Biden’s VP. She has a ton of foreign policy experience being a former UN Ambassador and National Security Advisor, and Joe Biden has talked about many times wanting to repair global relationships and Rice would be a good fit for that
Don't vote for Joe Biden
Would you like some cheese with your whine?  In every primary except 5, the combo of Sanders/Warren lost to Biden+the rest.  All but 5! Those 5 provided a margin of 145,831 votes.  Just thru 3/10, S/W lost by 2.865m votes.  But you keep believing you won. 1/2
LOL, you believe Notre Dame supports Joe Biden. LOL
False.  And dumb whataboutism. This is about Notre Dame, no Joe Biden.  Creepy that you call others creepy.
Did I miss something? Biden’s been President for 40 years? I never realized one Senator could fix everything! And if we wanted someone to accomplish nothing we would all vote for Trump strictly on his track record.
Law and order belongs to Trump. Biden owns this.
Organizers expect those efforts will net hundreds more signatures, including from Biden delegates...
I think Susan Rice would be a bad choice for Biden.  Too much baggage.  Harris and Demmings are my two top choices now.
If your prediction is true, then it will all go away when Biden becomes president
Wake up and smell the roses, Biden’s a joke and so is your support for him.
You seriously think Trump supporters are going to listen to you? 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Biden can’t even form a complete sentence and refuses to take questions from media, debate Trump, or be interviewed by Chris Wallace.   Your party is a joke if that’s the best you can do.
So very nice of her to spruce it up for the Biden’s.

Shit like this is getting me angry with the VP process. Some people are looking like idiots and are insulting biden voters (which are the backbone of the party)

Donnie, more lies from the pathogical Liar-in-Chief. YOU are a large part of the lamestream media.   Biden will win in a landslide.  PS, you really should read Mary Trump's book.  If only you could read a book!  (Worst, laziest president in American history.)
It certainly appears that EVERY tweet of yours is a lie, Donnie. Why is that?  YOU vote by mail-in! Everyone knows YOU are a pathological liar. Biden's gonna crush you in November. I'll do my part. Then the SDNY will do their part. Be afraid, Donnie.
LIKE OR NOT LIKE? In the same announcement, Biden should unveil both his VP choice AND his cabinet nominees.  Trump has surrounded himself with yes men / unqualified hacks.  This move would further show the contrast between Biden's &amp; Trump's focus on governing.
False. Biden is crushing Trump. All Biden has to do is let Trump whine to Fox "News," Hannity and tweet. In reality, Trump is crushing himself. From COVID-19 to the economy to race relations, Trump has taken a giant dump on America. Biden will win in a landslide.
Because shame voting will convice others to vote for Biden
Dude, legit, I thank you for your service but stop calling yourself a conservative. No self respecting conservative would vote for the shit show that Biden supports.

✔️ You're so right, I think that's becoming apparent.  Biden doesn't even need to (nor does he) respond to stupid things Trump says about him.  When he gets to the White House he should get a rescue pitbull and name it Lincoln Project
Just because you vote for Joe Biden doesn’t mean he will actually be the president.
Would you like Biden to point out your missteps speaking?  The Daily Show has a nice montage.  Poke the pony and Biden could make you look really bad.
No one believes you on Obama/Biden being the most corrupt.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden built white guilt and resentment.
That's about the only reason to do it.  But I don't think that's a good enough reason.  Biden can do another town hall instead, to prove he's fine
To clarify - if any candidate were doing as well as Biden I'd also advise them not to debate.  It's not that I'm worried Joe will do poorly, it's that there is no upside for him.  I like that idea of Trump releasing his taxes as a precondition.
I'm thinking Biden can only lose ground.  If he does very well he breaks even.
That's the flip side.  I think Biden can just say no and be fine.  He can't gain anything from the debates
I think Trump needs the dates, Biden doesn't
That's the other side of the equation.  We know Trump will come prepared with only insults &amp; nicknames for Biden, his son &amp; wife.  I don't think Biden loses anything saying "Buzz off. I'm not going to debate the Malarkey Madman since we already know Trump doesn't know any facts."
DEBATES Is there even one reason for Biden to agree to debate?  There's only downside when he's up this much in all the polls
If Trump were the mayor of Chicago crime would be under control. Let that sink in because Biden is less competent that Lightfoot.
5 or 6 months late, Homie. There are now almost 150,000 Americans dead from the Trump Virus. You failed. Trump failed. Republicans failed. The American people won't fail in November. Biden in a landslide!
You forgot no country.  Biden is working with Sanders &amp; AOC right now to open the borders to Soetoro’s OFA and Soros’ OSI, make this a sanctuary country for anyone who wants to come, allow everyone to vote (no ID  req’d), turn all private property to the State for communal use.
145,000 dead Americans won't be voting for Donnie. Many of the 11% unemployed won't either. Neither will many women or people of color. Certainly very few Dems and independents will vote for the worst president ever. Can you say *landslide for Biden*?
Nope. We're certainly not going to (re)elect the  absolute worst president in the history of the United States. We will elect Joe Biden in a landslide. Bless your heart, Junior. Time is running out, indeed. Buh bye.
And Joe Biden has one?
Biden is an infinitely better candidate than Trump. American icon? He’s a damn con man. But I guess if you’re one of the ones who has been conned, you’ll go to great lengths to justify supporting him.

n the interviews with liberals, Biden has not been asked to repeat the words, "I support defunding the police." Instead, he has been asked whether he supports redirecting funding from police departments to other purposes. And he has said that he does. From Washington Examiner
Whoever did that to those officers should absolutely be arrested and charged. That being said, I'm looking forward to a Biden landslide in November.
Biden is NOT defunding police !!!
Rasmussen, a Republican biased poll, has you at 80%. That's about 60,000,000 people. Not enough to win in November based on your polling against Biden. You shouldn't be golfing this weekend. You should have stayed in DC.
Yes, really. You’re being lied to. He didn’t cause the deaths, and he didn’t wreck the economy. We who see the truth will not be distracted. We will support our president over Biden the puppet. We will not be bullied by the elites like you or your socialist mobs.
Watching a Dan Jones history video about Edward IV. Hanging out in the background is a mentally unstable Henry VI, who very much reminds me of Joe Biden.  I’m sorry they just killed The Earl of Warwick.
I’m convinced Trump sees the writing on the wall. He knows he’s going to lose in November and is intent on leaving the country in the worst financial shape possible for Joe Biden to deal with. He is that much of a monster.
Sssssh. Biden will call you a racist:
Because you and Trump don't give a damn about American lives!  We have 3 1/2 years of evidence. The nation, and in fact the world, is looking forward to Joe Biden's landslide victory on November 3rd.

Joe Biden turns 78 shortly after the election. Whoever this VP pick is better be ready to serve as Biden’s mind withers away.
No probs
It was a question, literal question, sorry. Not a statement. Twitter is hard sometimes.
Did he not resign in disgrace?
The GOP wants you to believe that all of the people who oppose POUTS are - left-wing radicals - a mob  They're trying to ignore: - The #WallofMoms in Portland - POUTS's huge polling deficit in the suburbs - Independents who solidly support Biden - Veterans
"Offer"? This isn't something that Fox 'News' does for a guest's benefit. Joe Biden hardly needs their help.   Let's not inflate #FakeNews' influence for them. "Invitation" and "request" are the correct terms.
HERE’S What Your Kids Will Learn in School if Biden is President  via
Or he could cheat.  Or accuse Biden of cheating and just not leave.
Real policy is vital for the American people. Joe Biden may not be ”exciting,” but he has policy and policy that will help this country.
I have a meme..lemme find it. That video is awful. I can’t believe people think Biden is a communist. It’s ridiculous. I had to block my brother on FB for thinking that way.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Every election, other countries try to figure out who's going to become president and then make sure the candidate knows they were supportive.  But this has been Poroshenko's message since Giuliani first started pushing the hoax w/ Kremlin help in 2018.
Charlamagne Tha God Tells Joe Biden to ‘Shut the Eff Up’ Over ‘First Racist President’ Remark
My issue is that Dave has always said he is apolitical and that Barstool should be the same. If that is the case, they would not have interviewed Trump or they would interview Biden as well.
I wouldn’t wish covid on anyone but these are the type of mooks just passing it around. Smh I bet Soros and Biden just sleeping like babies through this bs... promise they don’t if Biden is elected. A war is a match head dragging along the strike - Dems are pulling it right along
1. "Defund the police" doesn't appear in Joe Biden's policy brief.  2. Joe has said publicly he doesn't support "defunding the police".  This means that Eric Trump is just fear-mongering with a GOP hoax. And violating his agreement to stay out of politics.
How about VP and then Biden can resign and Obama will be President again.
Ever wonder how anyone could believe that a bunch of extremist idiots control a political party? Easy: they let it happen to themselves.  Debunked:  1. "Defund the police" doesn't mean abolish them; it means reallocate non-police work &amp; $$.  2. 68% of Independents support Biden.
Make no mistake - the Republican Party is in chaos over POUTS's causing over 225,000 deaths by Nov 1 and trying to start a war with the American public to distract from it.  Any claims they make about Democrats or Biden or any other bogeyman they try to manufacture s/ be ignored.
If this is the kind of performance that Joe Biden has to beat, it's plain sailing from here, Nikki.  And this doesn't even include the past year's gaffes by POUTS.
In VP search, Biden has a known quantity in Susan Rice
I keep seeing people talking shit on here about others who support(ed) one candidate or another in the primary and I'd like it if they'd just block me or go hop into the Biden camp and help out or jump into the tRump camp and go fuck all the way off unto the ends of the earth...
LA Times hits the nail on the thumb.  Biden should challenge Trump to an SAT.
Hogan Gidley's alleged 'evidence' that Fox News' polls are "fake" is that POUTS does better than Biden on social media.   That's pretty rich, considering that over 65% of POUTS's Twitter account followers are bots, i.e. *they're fake*.

Instead of investigating whistle-blower complaints about the Trump Admin, Republicans continue their witch hunt for improper conduct by VP Biden in Ukraine, although it's a Kremlin op (Dr Hill).  They've dismissed US intel reports of foreign interference.
YESSSSSSSS! Florida lead might be real.
One thing I will critique Biden on. He needs to do a least one speech and one press conference a week. Keep the beast of the press off his back if he answers at least once a week.
if you cant respect another person for there political views you should have views, i would never bash Biden or any other candidate, rather listen to why they support him.
Biden asked Obama not to endorse him, which is likely why it took so long.  More:
But you said masks look like muzzles. If Trump says to wear a mask you kiss his ass but when Biden does you tell him it looks like a muzzle. You're such a fuckin kiss ass.No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
IDC am voting for Biden no matter who he picks i endorsed Harris for VP but i ain't toxic
A Biden administration would not ban flights from China as he is in their pocket. Plus your economy is 1/500 the US economy and 35x less people.
How original!! I love it! That describes Hiden Biden to a T
They creating too much excuses.. in fact they are the one doing fraud scheme. Old tricks! They want to create other Wikileaks but sorry.. President Biden 2020!
They are the ones doing this. Biden 2020

I hope President Biden pick you Secretary of State..  .

Thank you Trump's tweet is nothing but a distraction why do people have to fall for this? Come on we need to stop giving Trump anything what he wants is a distraction cause he knows he losing states like Texas and if Biden wins Texas Trump has no path to reelection
Are unicorns sprouting out of Biden’s ass? OF COURSE they won’t
Biden didn't do that
Um no. Affordable care act. Biden was part of that. Obama got it done.
Biden for President!
Moms are for Biden. Sit down.
#EvictTrump is trending he is bringing down the value of Mar A Lago and the WH. The value of Trump Tower is also going down the drain if we want to bring back value in the WH we vote for Biden no matter how he does in debate stage.
You are the dad of the coronavirus!  Sick! We found the vaccine.President. Biden on Nov.3!
I will proudly vote for Biden no matter what happens am with you 100%
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Finally some good NH polling. Biden leads 53-40. I’ll say Likely D.
delusional human beings. here's a guy that was the worst president in the history of America and destroyed our country in 8 years. brought it to its knees and the economy. what a failure. along with that mental case old man Joe Biden who's not even fit to run Burger King 🖕🏾
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party | US elections 2020 | The Guardian
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Well since Rachel Maddow is off this week i hope she enjoys the time off and gets plenty of rest she will need it for January when they indictments come and news stories of Trumpers being charged breaks news if Biden wins
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I’m watching Tucker Carlson now playing some clips of Biden.  For God’s sake the man is not in control of his faculties.  He’s not remotely qualified to be president
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
😂 Biden can’t form a sentence let alone have interviews and Mr. “Dictator of Disney” thinks he’s what’s needed?
Biden leading in Texas now if that lead holds on election day Biden becomes the president no matter what happens now we need to vote like our lives depend on it to make it happen
Well, that sucks. Obviously, that makes Putin happy. The only good thing is that a President Biden can reverse this.
Also, I think we both know that Biden is most likely not going to be one in charge.  His  VP most likely will be....his VP is going to be even more on the left than he is...
As, to Bernie supporters not supporting Biden.  I hope that's the case, I hope they not that stupid to actually support him.  However there's graph based on his platform vs Trump's platform that shows that  Biden moved significantly more to the left than Trump to the right.
We wait til Biden makes the announcement politico has inadvertently gave the GOP a head start attacking one of his potential VP picks we can't give them anything
Actually,  Joe Biden is pretty left right now..on his policies. Federal National gun ban is NOT centrist policy,  it's leftist policy.  Wouldn't you say so?
I’d let Biden watch my dog, but never my children or grandchildren.  He’s lost.  His supporters must be planted, because no one could be stupid enough to think he’s qualified for President

Trump once again failed our nation but you won't President Biden. Pray for you and all Covid 19 victim's often.
Barletta did overperform in Luzerne.  I think Trump is favored to carry it, but probably by a similar margin to Barletta even if Biden is winning the state by less than Casey did.
When am I getting my 2nd Republican SOCIALIST $1200 check??? Dumbass Donny doesn't have to sign it, but I prefer $2000 every month until Biden can solve Covid-19.
Yeah because most people protesting nazis have a swastika nearby .  They’re   supporters trying to spread their lies at Walmart.
Lucerne County, PA- Trump vs Biden
This article was really interesting.  General consensus is that Biden will win Lackawanna by a strong margin.

The Biden's taking time to be with Nancy Pelosi in honoring John Lewis's memory is touching she should have been the one to speak and Kamala Harris should have spoke instead of Moscowmitch
Chris Dodd needs to resign from the VP selections committee and hand over the job to someone more qualified like Amy Klobuchar she would make a perfect adviser one she dropped out of being in commission and she recommended that Biden should pick a person in color as his VP.
It's already happening proudsocialist has said he won't vote for Biden and he used to be a wonderful resister til the day he became a Bernie Bro
WTF Tlaib is not a real democrat for refusing to endorse Biden so starting now i am endorsing her challenger Brenda Jones just like I endorsed Amy McGrath over Charles Booker. Bernie Bros are electing fake democrats and trying to make our party toxic.
Prayers for those in hurricanes wake president Biden
😂 You are deluded bruh. First Lady Jill Biden? She’ll be spending more time finding Joe’s memories.
Solid favorite, but still Likely R. I bet Biden makes it to a 5% loss in this district. Went for Obama 2012 and Duckworth in 2016, and narrowly for Pritzker in 2018.  Brendan Kelly’s numbers in the rural counties last time were unimpressive.
Biden needs a running mate that will excite voters and that person is Kamala Harris. Elizabeth Warren would be a great VP but there would be increased risk of lower turnout among the black community and he needs someone young who can take his place and Kamala is the person.
What is the most realistic target for Biden in  "Lean R" category?
Hmm, not a Trump support one bit or Biden. Doesn't matter who wins this election. We're fucked either way.
I think it's a good idea; Clinton won the state by only 2% and there hasn't been a lot of polling. Biden is favored in NV but it is worth spending in.
Biden Takes Aim At Tax Cheats Like Amazon – Breaking News USA. I just cancelled my prime. Do it. It feels great. And get rid of Facebook and Instagram while you are at it!  Trust me on this.
I’m not denying it is trending right. But Biden won’t be losing the county by 40%. It will probably vote to the left of the state.
Of course there’s a downballot lag- but even Jim Gray won this county in 2016 against Rand Paul.  Biden will improve upon Hillary Clinton in these kind of counties.  Remember- Elliott is an Obama 2012 county.
Not too hot of a take, but Elliott County KY is Likely R at presidential level; it was won by all the statewide Dems in 2019, and Biden at least has a shot there if he is keeping to state to 20%.
#TrumpCantKeepItUp the news that's coming to him Hurricane Hanna tore down Trump's wall he can accelerate the construction all he wants but the construction sites will be turned into bulldozing sights in 2021 Biden will tear down Trump's wall and Trumpers will be crying nonstop.
#BernellTrammell was killed for supporting  In Biden’s America such would be common place. November we should vote in honor of #BernellTrammell! #USA 🇺🇸
Hide till 2021 and let Biden run this Country
That says it all.  The man is in the twilight of his life.  His IQ and cognitive capacity are in the decline.  He cannot think on his feet.  A Biden presidency would be a disaster
I doubt Biden would veto a marijuana bill.
This is one of the few criticisms I have for Biden. It needs to be legalized and regulated federally like alcohol/tobacco.  But it’s ok because Congress may not agree- I think some Republicans may even come around, because it could be a fiscal/personal freedom issue.
People that refuse to support Joe Biden aren’t progressives.
1.Trump won't concede  2. It is true that we won't know the results for days and weeks 3. You are correct that we still have to deal with him til January  4. No matter what Trump does between November and January Biden will be sworn in no matter what happens he can't stop it.
He can try all he wants but he can't stop Biden from being sworn in on January if he wins
He should but why can't Pelosi fill in for him til election day then Biden
Harris is the most logical choice she offers a regional advantage she can help Biden win states like Arizona Georgia narrow down Mississippi and win North Carolina
Biden is a dog-faced pony liar.
you got that right make sure you vote for President Trump has been doing a phenomenal job. coming from the worst president in the history of America and the slimeball sleepy Joe Biden. pedophiles.
Dude, legit, I thank you for your service but stop calling yourself a conservative. No self respecting conservative would vote for the shit show that Biden supports.
Yes .. Trump is President only Nov 2. 2020z Nov 3  is for President Biden.😂😂😂
I bet Biden keeps MN-1 within 5%. MN-8 probably within 10%.
Keep in mind, Biden will also probably do better than Clinton's ~2% margin statewide
Exactly, I bet Biden will narrow the gap in MN-7 to more like 15-20% than 30%- big difference. I also expect him to improve quite a bit in MN-1 and MN-8 (Trump will probably carry both districts, but not by 15%).
Yeah, Lean D is reasonable, I do expect Biden to carry the state, but anything more is way too presumptive for such a close state.
Your life is going to change when Biden is sworn in. I don't know if there will be a place to hide.
I agree, I think Biden is favored in AZ, but Kelly will outrun him by a few percent.  McSally is basically screwed unless Trump completely turns this election around- which isn’t impossible, unfortunately
How bout "if you have trouble figuring out if you're for me or Trump. You ain't black." - Joe Biden. That one's pretty good how about “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” - Joe Biden
Trump is the only hope!! Hiden Biden is a puppet
A pretty safe district I'm watching- Oregon 4th District. Clinton won this district by 0.1%, but I believe Biden is in little danger of losing it to Trump. DeFazio is a longtime incumbent, but has only been challenged by the same perennial candidate for several elections(1/2)
Just wait until the oppo researchers get into Joe Biden's freezer. He's probably been hoarding rare Ben and Jerry's flavors.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.     #truth #WakeUpAmerica
I don’t even like Biden. Do you have an example of any of the “many things” Trump has done?
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message!
Exactly. Biden has released his already so that would give Trump an unfair advantage.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I wish all 11,460 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Fucking gross. Sorry but no other words describe this
A Trumper took a screenshot of my profile picture and typed the words no need to fear Biden's bitches are here and i take it as a compliment lol I am a loyal Biden supporter and proud of it raise your hand if you are a loyal Biden supporter.#Biden2020
BIDEN CALLED THIS A MOVEMENT AND ASKED, "WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?!"   i don't think he gets it
Waiting for my Biden yard sign has not arrived yet.
Plus it'll be a good year for Dems. It's the kind of situation where if Lipinski had been primaried in a Biden midterm, and the R's had a candidate with money, it would be Likely D. It's a suburban district, but more WWC than suburban districts like IL-6 and IL-14.
Reasonable. I’d say OK-5 is probably Tilt R, if you say Rs have the advantage.  Republican runoff is a liability, both candidates aren’t doing so great with funds, and Biden may even win the district this time.
Source? I hope Biden announces her as VP next week endorsed Harris for VP not long after Super Tuesday and not long after Bernie dropped out
Same if he does that Biden is winning Arizona New Mexico and Nevada since they similar voting groups
Agreed I will not take a vaccine from our country til Biden becomes president he will be the one releasing the vaccine to the public
Trumpers can laugh at my reply of saying Biden has the lead in Florida all they want but if Biden wins the state we will be the ones who said told you so and we will have the last laugh and the last word and I can't wait it will be satisfying
Also the economist is giving Biden an 85% chance of winning Florida a state that typically votes to the right of the popular vote and undecided voters typically end up going to the GOP
Another day, another example of how Trump is the one who is insane, and Biden just has a lifelong stuttering problem which can be edited to own the libs
That’s not true, I even have a blog where I write articles and support my claims with evidence.  I am not ignorant, I know what I am talking about.  Everything the left accuses you of doing they are doing. So your side is ignorant. Your leader(Joe Biden) is ignorant and stupid.
Not happening since you are already making Democrats, that we’re neutral or civil, leave because of the Communist angle you are endorsing. Hell you’re using Biden.
How can Biden be for science when he can’t form a sentence or think Black Trump supporters aren’t black for some reason? As far as I know voting against Democrats doesn’t scientifically mean you go against your skin color.
Even Newsweek can't avoid admitting that Biden is obviously full of shit. "Overtures to appear receptive to their needs"
You mean a CDC that admitted to lying about the cases recently? Biden? How much did he and the nurses caress you to vote for him?
2016 polls vs current polls hear that Trumpers Biden has a stronger lead than Hillary did he outperforming her margins he is not as well hated. The attacks against Biden don't land and they were not that far off if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins period math is math.
Trumpers questioned the polls in Florida which Biden is leading by 6% do they realize the polls were near spot on on election day 4 years ago Trump was leading by 0.4% when he won by 1.2%. Assuming they make same mistake they made 4 years ago Biden wins Florida period.
Oh such a sweetie..poor little guy wants to go to school. You will get us back to normal with God's grace president Biden..
Thank you Amy if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins the state all he needs is one more swing state and he is president and there is nothing maga can do about it math is math
I think Biden is likely to improve on Clinton in most of the ancestral Dem Appalachian counties. Hillary Clinton was basically the worst possible candidate for those areas. I think Biden will lose WV by more like 30% than 42%.
You forgot no country.  Biden is working with Sanders &amp; AOC right now to open the borders to Soetoro’s OFA and Soros’ OSI, make this a sanctuary country for anyone who wants to come, allow everyone to vote (no ID  req’d), turn all private property to the State for communal use.
I mean, it's possible if Biden continues to dominate, though I'm doubtful about MO and IN, even in a huge landslide I think SC would go blue before them.
Biden is an infinitely better candidate than Trump. American icon? He’s a damn con man. But I guess if you’re one of the ones who has been conned, you’ll go to great lengths to justify supporting him.
I heard the bushes helped Nazi Germany with their treasure and their stolen treasure move it from Nazi Germany to South America. The bushes are bunch of atheist hillbillies. he backs Biden he's a loser.
President Trump,The atheist Democrats news stations will say that you're losing and you're doing real bad how can you be losing against Joe Biden. I have more going for me mentally then Joe Biden I just didn't Rob the Americans and steal all their money all these years.
It really did seem like Dems were in Disarray at that point.  Luckily Delaware is beyond Safe with Biden as the nominee.
President Biden to you!
What was President Trump supposed to do? More importantly what Biden could of done?
100 days til election day everyone and 100 days starts an important journey for Biden it will test if Biden's lead is really as strong as polls suggest or will the election be closer than we thought.
So vote for Biden? The (D)evilAwakens
When Biden Wins and Trump is ARRESTED!!🤣🤣😂😂
Even if polls in Florida are off by same margin they were in 2016 Biden still wins Florida and if Texas is off too Biden wins
Trump's playbook in connecting Biden to the far left like Bernie Sanders isn't working at all according to the guests in the reidout show they hoped to use this playbook if Bernie Sanders was the nominee but that didn't work so nominating Biden foiled his plans and I am relieved
Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping now at 71% down from 72% a 1% may not seem like a big deal but the fact that Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping is a very good sign for Biden if he wins Texas Biden becomes the next president no matter what happens
The economist unlike fivethirtyeight has a predicted range of electoral college votes and Trumpers think that Trump will win by a landslide that is simply not going to happen Trump's EC range is 123-279 Biden's range is 259-415 Trump is loosing support period.
Under Biden, taxes will rise on individuals and corporations, causing a rise in unemployment, stock market will crash as companies make less, crime will increase with less police, social medicine will result in rationing, ISIS and terrorism will be reborn, and the list goes on
Biden's polling is much better than Hillary Clinton's. He has a more consistent and larger lead in swing states. Trump's campaign is effectively over.
Not a good poll at all for Goroff…. behind by 7% and underperforming Biden by 7% in her own internal.....
Biden. Not a landslide, but a convincing victory.
These numbers are terrible for Trump. The only way he wins is if him and Biden are equally as unpopular in swing states, and that clearly isn't the case.
So magically your taxes go up paying a rate of 12% most likely. Lol. And joe Biden is magically gonna make your taxes go down. Blame fatty pritzker for your tax problems.   You don’t see Iran threatening USA nor North Korea. You don’t see ww3 memes anymore.
Very interesting map. Biden is ahead in my zip code (60126) by 335-194; it went for Clinton by about 15% in 2016.
And also yeah, fuck Obama and Biden. Both are racist. This just isn't a conversation about them. I don't know why you keep bringing them up
more like say anything Biden. bobblehead Biden. weekend at Bernie's Biden. 😂🤣🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕BIDEN🖕
Also *** future President Biden will make it right with
Notice how little presence Biden needs on the campaign trail. The more trump blunders about, the more minds are made up. I would be surprised if there are even Presidential debates this year. People want to vote and wrap this up.
The fact that Biden is doing better in Pennsylvania than in Michigan and Wisconsin means he has home field advantage
🤣🤣😂😂 Nice pipe dream there! Seriously and using a photo of protesters in 2014 in another Country saying this is how it would be under Biden! Oh you must be snorting adderall with Trump huh! 😂😂🤣🤣
Lol. Walk into traffic. Save yourself. Trump and Biden aren’t doctors. Neither is bill gates. Elite as in people who run the world. Not doctors who’ve been lied to as well.
Joe Biden is a dork
We won't be i am just saying we should be spending money in races that are winnable and Texas is winnable now if you were to ask me that 6 months ago I would have said no way. Things are constantly changing Biden is most likely going to be spending time in the south and rust belt
New poll by Quinnipiac University has Biden up by 13% which just got released today and they have a B+ rating according to fivethirtyeight
New poll came out today showing Biden up by 13% according to the Quinnipiac University poll which has a B+ rating by fivethirtyeight
Holy cow a new poll released by Quinnipiac University which has a B+ rating by fivethirtyeight shows Biden up by 13% in Florida i mean wow Biden up by double digits in a state that is typically so close it takes a long time to call the state. If this lead holds Trump is doomed.
Exactly Biden's lead is narrowing according to fivethirtyeight he was up by 9% on average now 7.7%
According to the economist Biden has a 90% chance of winning Pennsylvania 88% for Wisconsin 90% for Michigan. Trump has a 72% chance of winning Texas we must change this if we going to win Texas and lockdown the rust belt if we win Texas Biden wins the election no matter what.
Thank you madam president the Biden's VP pick will be targeted by bogus claims and they plan to target her cause they are sexist and afraid of strong women
Biden gets Creepier &amp; Creepier all the time.
Common Tony, we all know if Biden or Killery somehow was president this virus would have NEVER happened🤔🤔🤬🤬 we do know that ISIS would've probably overtaken most of America,and most of us would not have had JOBS 🤬🤬🤬🤬  #TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Strong ? The only strength is in numbers is Republicans voting for Biden and the numbers on the virus moron #TrumpMeltdown
Absolutely true. I wish you luck in getting Biden close to 40% and saving our nation from a 2nd term of Trump.
The Presidential debate moderators has come up with their first question for Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden, What color is the White House?🤪
Not trying to dissuade you, I hoped for Bernie and I'm voting Biden too. We just need better in the future.
I'm not a fan of his. But wouldnt it help him more to let crime go out of control here. He says repeatedly that all of america will look like chicago if Biden wins. LolHe’s a danger to this country by trying to unconstitutionally delay an election, which hasn’t been done EVER through wars, depressions, or epidemics. Unless you count Roosevelt’s 4 Terms. He’s scared he’s going to lose as evident by Biden’s numbers in the polls.
Bet he calls for a bs review on the ballots after Biden wins. Yes let’s investigate the meaning of why I LOST, but the reason I won 2016? Russian Propaganda? Lets just forget about it bc im a narcissist who likes to grab em by the pussy and can’t accept my losses; right Trump? :)
Your reply indicates you agree Biden will weaken our democracy, end protections. He’ll be a good guy &amp; not use that power (Bull$hit). Will Drumpf2.0 refuse to use it?  &amp; if Dems are “resisting” why did they give 🍑 🤡 more powers?  Dems/GOP sold out🇺🇸 a long ago &amp; yeah, I miss it
The Republican-controlled Senate approved his budget. The same GOP-led Senate has allowed children to be treated like animals. As for a tax break, I didn't qualify, but if I did, it would have went to the Biden campaign. COVID repsonse.? He waited over 2 months to respond.
Biden 2020 eat my ass
You’re done, history, chopped liver.  Biden in a landslide.
No..not the same.  Obama made it possible for Drumpf to use “secret” police.  A Dem Congress just gave scary Drumpf additional surveillance powers.  What powers do you think Biden will give the next fascist authoritarian? Executions in the streets? Torture of US citizens?  Yippee
You’re done.  Biden in a landslide.
Biden in a landslide.
July 14, 2016, CNN had Clinton ahead by 12%, same poll this year has Biden ahead by 6%, either way if Biden ever comes out of his basement and debates Trump, Biden will have a Chernobyl level of implosion
Why would I believe Biden would do anything for ppl during a pandemic.  The Dems haven’t fought for us. Each stimulus pkg went through &amp; they said “next time”.  That’s what they’ve said for decades.  So...they can have my vote...next time.Biden has a communist on his short list, Karen Bass.  She wants to eliminate anti-discrimination laws to legalize discrimination against those w/ a #WhiteStory, #RedStory, etc.  Their plan, sacrifice you the individual for the “Altruistic Goals” of the State.  #twill
DUH???  What planet is Trump on?  Does Biden know where he is?  Someone please stop this LEFT/RIGHT MADNESS!!!
But you are supporting a Biden one
Damn right! I'd *also* like Dems to state--for the record--that any move to fill a Supreme Court vacancy between now and 1/20/21 will lead to TWO new Supreme Court seats being created (and filled) by President Biden.
Can you imagine the absolute shit fit  Hannity, Rush Dipshit and all the other fucks would have had if either Clinton, Obama, or Biden even loosely hinted at delaying an election?
This will definitely get Bernie voters to flock to Biden if she's picked
Biden has the greater intellect &amp; emotional intelligence. Voting third party is not my choice as there is not a viable candidate.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
Where’s your apology to Joe Biden?
Gosh Bernie, it means we’ll vote for Biden for sure.  Freebies mean everything to us.  We’ll do anything for the Big Brother who takes care of us.
Biden’s got voters in Erie, PA!
Come on over. Do you really think Biden will be making the decisions? They will kick him out within 6 months with the 25th. Then a possibility that Pelosi would be VP. Do you really want that?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled “Trump’s AmeriKKKa “ with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
Biden is a useful idiot and it shows.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.
I swear to god, Biden is gonna pick Kamala because the only thing he consistently does is make shitty decisions.
Speaking of Russia, are you going to address the Bounties on our Military or just let Biden when he takes over ???
So their saying Harris is Joe’s VP pick a woman you gave blowjobs to get were she is today wow and She would be the first Female President well all I can say it’s good thing her and Clinton isn’t there at the same time wow Harris and Biden is the best Democrats have to offer
Biden is the guy who says the grink
Meanwhile Joe biden is locked in his basement so he'll keep his hands off young girls and you've said nothing about it.
98 days till election and counting.. go for Biden’s cabinet!
It was so classy of President Biden to pay his respects to John Lewis.   Former President 45 probably had a hard time collecting his liddle thoughts, and getting down the ramp to attend.   #Trumplethinskin #Sniffles #ImPOTUS #imPEACHED
Biden is going to have to do such a massive cleanse of the White House before he moves in.
And this is why, at any other moment, I’d never vote for Biden. However, there are two clear reasons to vote for him: he’s not Trump; Harris as VP.
You're mindless drones that just use "competent biden guy bad, orange man good" arguments. Hilarious.
It is a big deal. Biden will move as the party moves. Put more progressive into congress and the Senate and he will keep getting dragged left along with them.
I got a running list of things for which Biden needs to apologize, but he will still get my vote. Harris is my choice for VP no apologies necessary.   Trump is using the Constitution as toilet paper &amp; people want her to grovel? We are in trouble
Your tweet confirms trump has a real chance at winning 4 more years. I've said the same thing &amp; got the same argument from some independent voter.  Biden was my 2nd to last choice but he will get my vote to try to get out of a dictatorship
You can dislike Biden, and be critical of his flaws, while still acknowledging the reality that he is very different from Trump in many policy areas.

I'm also on the democratic mailing list and only get 1 maybe 2 emails a month though and never got this many before Trump. I dont normally donate to campaigns but I probably would donate to Biden if he chose Duckworth as VP
Minnesota has elected very radical democrats. Two people being stupid, whether real or not these days is not an example of one party.  Biden has been in politics for 45 years. In order to do that he's had to change sides/opinions countless times.  Keep putting career dems back
Are you saying biden is not winning Minnesota?
Okay...but does that REALLY matter? This election ain't about money. Biden campaign brought in more money last quarter if I'm not mistaken. If EW ain't President, she should stay in Senate or accept cabinet position.
Biden pushes to teach Islam in U.S. public schools
The greatest threats to America are Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Antifa, BLM and the obscene racist ideology of ‘antiracism’.  Next to these, China is a piker.
Wanna back up what you said? As of now it's literally a fact that biden was in the office and helped spy on the incoming administration. Is that what you meant?
I realize that after Biden is elected you will again be the opposition, but it will be good to have they loyal opposition rather than this idiocy we’ve had.  I am hoping the Republican Party comes to its senses and Trumpism dies as ignominiously as it started.

WOW, Mr. Trump!! Your COVID press conference has made me reconsider your failures of the last 3.7 years. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IS BRING ALL THE UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY AMERICANS YOU KILLED BACK TO LIFE! When this is done I will consider voting for you this November. #Biden
How is this Biden’s protest? Trump is President right now, while this is occurring, and he is actively making the situation worse.
Racist, Facsist, Authoritarian imbecile, damn fool. These are Trump’s calling cards. America needs better! NOW. #Biden
It will be much better when President Biden unveils President Obama's official portrait. Trump doesn't deserve the honorThis presidential election is probably the best example I have seen so far. Trump vs Biden. A lot of people don't like either choice. The idea of protesting/activism doesn't even occur to them. What can people accomplish with both?
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.

What funeral? The divisive Obama Biden political rally?!
Trump is Foxifying VOA. Remember the normal people who ran the VOA and quit mid June, only to be replaced by Trumpsters? 6 weeks later...
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
Trump is doing an AWESOME job of defining himself in terms favorable to Biden. Please proceed.
I cannot believe I am going to have to vote for Joe fucking Biden this year. You win, universe.
Gonna be interesting when he refuses to cede power to Biden if Biden wins.
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
Is this when President Biden announces a real plan to deal with COVID-19 in 2021!
Idiot. There are gun control laws that prohibit the unlawful possession of guns. Only a mentally ill person could believe a new law will stop illegal gun ownership. She needs to be Biden's running mate. Both clueless.

Joe Biden is going to be the President of the nursing home... no doubt.

Joe Biden being president from a Trans Am seems like it would cause Amy Carter’s Shoe’s to explode in orgasmic joy.  cc:
In my estimation, Rice would be the best to try and repair the damage to our Foreign relations. Whether as VP, or Another Senior Cabinet Official Post Let our new POTUS, JOE BIDEN, decide. He'll pick his BEST 2nd IN COMMAND AND TOGETHER they will pick the very BEST,and BRIGHTEST!
Trumps presidency has cost us 150,000 American lives plus raising the deficit to world record highs along with record unemployment. How could Biden possibly make it worse than Trump?
They won't provide security and they will probably cancel it anyway because they're planning on running Joe Biden from his basement if he's awake
What has Obama and Biden done for blacks in their 8 years, tell me?
I think you want to blame the real cause, China, for all these desths, not Trump. If Biden was President the desths would be 1,000 times higher!
AG Barr is just slowly exposing the most corrupted administration in the history of the USA.  The Obama Biden administration! No wonder that the Democrats hate him.  But nobody is above the law! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Democrats Hypocrites!
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.

Biden had a Stroke
John Lewis’ was in state today. You didn’t go. And you didn’t even tweet condolences for a man who got the crap beat out of him because he was black, and fought the injustice until his death. What did you today? “Words on Twitter are mean to me.”
The choice is stark. The most prolific liar, the most corrupt and inept POTUS In History or a very competent, honest and caring politician in Biden.
And all 19 believe Biden vs none who believe anything Trump says.
Biden will not be in the debates. No way, no how. They are already scheming for ways to get him out.
Biden had a Stroke recently!
#SalsaTheVote !?!? Can someone tell bitch ass Biden and the Democrats to get this shit off Twitter quick and in a hurry!!!!
I know a few republicans who are voting for Biden because Trump is a danger to the US.
Still looking for your stories on Biden hiding and refusing to do interviews. #EnemyOfThePeople
I thought the same thing. But Biden actually had a STROKE!
Biden had a Stroke
If Biden wins he would be a hero on CNN
Wow, I didn’t see Biden embrace anything like that.
Over a thousand a day of us are dying from Trumps complete mismanagement of the Trump Corona Virus. Biden would be a tremendous improvement.
Yeah I don't get it. 59% of Trump voters have been contacted..  and 59% of Biden voters have been contacted
And Trump begged foreign leaders to manufacture dirt on Biden. Trump was impeached for it.
😂 WTF? Are you serious? You have to stop watching Alex Jones. The whole issue the liberals and progressives have against Biden is that he's Republican Lite™. He's what the GOP thinks it is. He's what a Republican is when cameras are turned on.
If they have any sense at all they will vote Biden. Trump is killing over 145,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump has done way more wrong than right.
Don't commit to any party, make them EARN your vote. Having said that, vote Biden. He's the second shittiest candidate in the history of politics, but we are facing literal destruction of America with a second Trump term.

Just saw the first Biden ad. Wow. So full of shit. Dems has 4 years and wasted it.
Maybe you take votes away from Biden and because of that we get another 4 years of Donnie. It’s probably your end game, tbh. Doesn’t make you any more relevant though, sorry pal.
Agreed.  Joe Biden is a poor unfortunate soul.  Well said!
What a nonsense!  It's very good that Joe Biden won't be the President and the puppet of the left mob in the White House! Hard to get a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is even much worse than her.
Wrong! Trump is right! I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
In NH, the key will be if Sununu gets through and wins a 3rd term as Governor as Biden blows Trump out for President.  If he does, he holds all the cards. He could decide to take a shot at the White House lesving the door open for Ayotte-Hassan II.....
Hello. Thanks for the tweet. Here's the rationale. If Biden blows Trump out by 10+, it would mark the biggest landslide by a Dem in a Pres. Election since LBJ over Goldwater in '64 (60-39). 2 yrs. later Republicans had a huge year....
Or grab little girls. Democrats are two things, 1) hypocrites 2) have no standards but the double standard. Believe all women unless you are Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein.  . . .
Another tweet to promote Trump by Maggie! Disgraceful! I never send Biden or Obama on her account! I could be wrong !
It's surreal to think the President's former personal attorney, who's now reportedly under federal investigation, would team up with a crew of Kremlin-connected Ukrainians with a record of spreading conspiracy theories. Yet, somehow, that's what's going on
The left mob has exposed themselves totally! I can't imagine a normal family who will vote for Joe Biden, who will be completely controlled by the left mob!
Are the rumors true that the Obama administration helped support the Wuhan lab with tons of taxpayer money where without our support they could not create this bio weapon and turn it against us. Hmmm Biden family has strong ties with China also!!! Strange!
Who cares. Regular citizen when he said that. Biden was in politics. Besides, what groupie doesnt want a billionaire to grab them by the pussy. I’ll wait!!!!!
You really need to stop this. Socialism isn’t happening get off your high horse and help us elect a real man. Joe Biden. He is far from corrupt.

🤣🤣🤣 there is nothing good. You see his commercial about Biden’s America. It’s funny cause he’s using the footage from what is going on in trumps America. He’s a failure. He can’t lead. He can’t handle pressure. He won’t listen to anyone. He gets up and tweets, golfs, TV.
Biden: Women ‘Have Never Had a Fair Shot to Get Ahead,’ Especially Minorities
Not ready for the "Karen" campaign. Right now white women are toxic (which is only slightly better than invisible). Best case, making themselves the center of attention (Wall of Moms) worst case, aggressive racism (Amy Cooper). Neither is a look Biden needs with his history.
But fewer people say the U.S. is on the right track. Plus, how we feel about the future of our jobs and the coronavirus threat. Explore the mood of the country in 8 charts.
I hope Trump wins for his pocket book. I’m so expert but if Biden wins, the stock market will take a big hit.
She's a white woman. Plus, Biden is already going to use her ideas and not give her credit. Certainly won't give her a position of authority. (sorry if I sound bitter. That is the experience of thousands of middle aged white women in the world of old white dudes)
Considering the trump campaign has been hammering Biden with accusations over his record on civil rights, that would be an amazing about face on their part.

Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn’t be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.

I'll still vote for progressive candidates in Dem primaries and I'll likely begrudgingly vote for Biden but honestly it's so damn frustrating.
I am showing Biden’s tweet to my friends of color that are doctors (2 of them ) , nurse , and a chiropractor. They will laugh in his face for this degrading tweet .

Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.

My point is if Biden has any brains he will put country before internal party power and he will make a unity VP pick. We don’t have the luxury to be fussy. That’s my point. Biden must be a leader and unite the party! So that we can vote blue no matter what!

I agree with that, portnoy probably should have told him. But I believe his personal politics and animosity towards Potus is what’s driving this. If portnoy interviewed a high level lib(like Biden) without telling him, something tells me he wouldn’t be so triggered.

This will happen in America, if we don't stop Democrats from buying the power of the Presidency.  Joe Biden promises free HC, maintenance man, nurse &amp; therapist for seniors?  Free childcare, free college, free housing?  Gov has no money, it does not take from taxpayers, or PRINT!
Even Jason admitted on TV that he understood Joe Biden was merely pointing out that other Presidents at the very least did not openly display hostility towards POC like Trump does.
This is Trumps America right now. Not Biden. This man is a disaster.YOUR DOING THE SAME THING WITH BIDEN SSKSSKSHSHSKS
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I’ve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn’t happen. We’ll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Mainstream media can’t promote Bill or Hillary endorsing Biden for President if they bring it up. Especially with Creepy Uncle Joes history.
trump is our national embarrassment. VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!!
So, we’re all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I’m really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. 🙃 I’ve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.
I am an Iowan for Biden but good luck!
Voting for Biden in one election doesn’t absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I’m more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it’s going to happen. And the cockiness I’m seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you’re right it’s not 2016. It’s an even worse situation where most people don’t even want Biden. That’s a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn’t run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.
Joe Biden? More like McDoesn't know where the fuck he is half the time.
Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris’s new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can’t afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn’t cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We’ve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden’s already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit now
Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. 🤣🤣 He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn’t need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it’s been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
That is hilarious. Now Biden’s dementia is right wing propaganda. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait...I thought this was Biden’s America?? November 3rd...vote!!!!!!
Then if it's not race related why is Biden ONLY considering a female person of color for his VP pick? Unfortunately, every thing is about race these days regardless of whether you like it or not.
Yeah vote for biden cause you are screwing us.
biden forgot how to spell joe this morning.
Also Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee... idk that seems like a compromise with the “middle” to me
Why couldn't we have had Booker instead of Biden?? 🤬🤬🤬
Biden LITERALLY told a room full of donors that, "Nothing will fundamentally change." His words.
Kamala Harris is an egomaniac. Biden will never take someone who will outshine. She insulted him he will never forgive her. We need to end all her hopes of ever becoming vice president or president She's a horrible Hillary Clinton wanna be. 🤮🤮🤮🤮
No one's falling for your distraction from the real news Biden is considering Karen Bass as VP. Anything you say or do is small beans compared to that.
Here lies Joe Biden:
Bring back decency. Rest in Power John Lewis. Trump refused to go honor his life. #JohnLewis #JoeBiden   “Joe and Jill Biden pay their respects to late civil rights icon John Lewis, who is lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
As President,  will fight for equal pay, combat discrimination and harassment in the workplace, invest in women-owned small businesses, expand access to health care and so much more. With the Biden Agenda for Women, we can build a tomorrow that is better for all of us.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

That’s nice of her to do that for Joe Biden
If he doesn’t go they’ll criticize him for not paying his respects  If he does go they’ll criticize him for not practicing social distancing. Damned if ya do damned if ya don’t. Whatever Biden decides to do will be considered “Presidential” though.
Have you read anything about Joe Biden?
Harris basically called Biden a racist in the debates. Joe like Hillary wants someone who will never threaten their position as POTUS. Kamala is not a yes girl or one to play 2nd fiddle. She's too ambititous and that's threatening to Biden. Even Hillary picked a yes man as VP.
FU K-Hive. Kamala Harris is too ambitious and will not be content to be 2nd in charge. Joe Biden has an ego like Hillary's and once you do him wrong, he never forgives.   Harris will NEVER be VP or president. Rep. Karen Bass  will be Biden's VP.

This is the funniest tweet I've ever seen. What kind of an idiot thinks Joe Biden is a leftist? Joe Biden is extremely conservative Democrat he borders on being a Republican🤮🤮🤮  There was absolutely nothing about Joe Biden did is remotely left or Progressive.
Do people really fall for this bullshit you’re peddling about Biden? #GOPBetrayedAmerica #Resist
this #liar will block anybody who exposes him. He willingly and openly does business with the corrupt and shady #Alibaba he told me he doesn't care. As long as he gets his money he doesn't care what they do. He is as #corrupt as #Biden I will continue to exposehim
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Wake up, MAGA! He hates YOU as much as he hates us...you just aren’t listening.🤷🏻‍♀️ #BlackLivesMatter  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  🍊🤡🤬🌊💙🌊💙☮️❄️
do you get enough personal pleasure from snarky comments about Biden, Obama, Hillary and Dems to keep you happy through 4 more years of DT’s regime? Your Junior High mean girl act is getting old.
so he blocks me after I exposed him for the fraud that he is. He is like Biden Jr, all he cares about is money.which is why he doesn't care about doing business with shady Alibaba, which commits intellectual property theft. And he knows they do. #MAGA #dirty #liar
Uhhh, hey ‘genius’....Biden isn’t the President so who IS the President to blame here?
this is the guy who suggested I do business with shady #alibaba ,aka China, who steal a intellectual property and resell it. He said he didn't care about morality, just about making money. Don't believe a word this dirty bird says. He is just like Biden.
If Joe Biden endorsed,  Medicare For All  Green New Deal  Work Place Democracy  Banning Private Prison  Marijuana Legalization   ... I might endorse him.
Quick, where do I vote for Biden?
I hope they slip a dementia test into the Biden/Trump debates. Just have ‘em both randomly trying to remember five words.
Is Biden secretly paying you? Because you keep sharing things that are a HUGE positive thing for the country if Biden is elected. I mean, I was already voting for him, but this is just another cherry on top. Keep highlighting his good policies. It helps sink Trump!
Can't wait for November 2020 when Biden wins the presidency and suddenly every single conservative media outlet starts becoming way more worried about coronavirus so they can blame him for not doing anything about it when he takes office in January.
Yep. When Biden wins itll all go back to normal. I'm glad. Trump is putting to much sunlight on our problems. It must stop.
The trump ad attacking Biden is nausea inducing. He's saying Biden is for defunding the police and it's a scare tactic. It looks like a bad cut-and-paste job. Joe Biden says, "Yes, absolutely." Yes absolutely to what? Maybe someone asked him if he wanted fries with that.
Mitt Romney is fear-mongering ultra religious conservative who wants to destroy Social Security &amp; Medicare. Trump is loosing and even he knows that.   Joe Biden is a conservative do nothing war-mongering noelib, but at least he's not a sociopath who's a wanna-be dictator.
Seeing Joe Biden's corpse being swallowed by the Leftist Mob should scare the shit out of every single moderate voter   But it doesn't which adds to the November fear   There probably will be a divide in the country post election
The reams of proposals reflect Biden’s belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.
Yes of course he is which makes him the lesser of two evils. My daughter is transgender I will not vote for anyone other than Biden in order to save my daughter from being murdered by Republicans.
Vote for Biden. He won't kill you unlike the previous tenant.
Correct...But I have to vote for Biden in order to destroy Trump Who will destroy my Trans daughter.
Biden is taking a nap and Snake Sabo can't stand you. Go back to Canada and stay there..
So is Biden going to pick a VP anytime soon or has he and he already forgot who it is?
JFC. It was...checking notes...Biden who championed the crime bill in 93 that put LARGE number of african americans in jail. Not Trump, not republicans. Floyd and Castile were actions of singular people. Not a group as a whole. Stop generalizing, it's dangerous and stupid.
Wasn't it your boy Biden who championed the crime bill in 93? Wasn't a republican. And what has Trump done specifically that has expressed that african american lives don't matter? Stop with the baseless accusations. Find something else to whine about.
I have been honest about it I'm voting for Biden. I don't like him I don't like nothing will fundamentally change I will fight him every moment that he's president I will do everything I can to make sure he never gets a second term.  Neoliberalism is evil and Trump is a sociopath
When Biden pats you on the back keep your hand on your wallet.
But, as bad as things are, if Biden wins, Trump is going to fuck things up that much worse so he can say that Biden is terrible. So, that's why we must vote for Trump, so he doesn't have to fuck things up even worse than he already has.Seriously, the “too ambitious to be VP” stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I'm arguing that defeating trump should come first and people shouldn't support trump, just because Biden doesn't rise to their extreme progressive agenda
This is really sad. I don’t like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"
Where do Biden’s top VP candidates stand on Israel?
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Same here, I hope her early confrontation with Biden isn't held against her, all the other candidates eventually piled on in their attacks against Biden, didn't they?
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn’t be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.
I'll still vote for progressive candidates in Dem primaries and I'll likely begrudgingly vote for Biden but honestly it's so damn frustrating.
I am showing Biden’s tweet to my friends of color that are doctors (2 of them ) , nurse , and a chiropractor. They will laugh in his face for this degrading tweet .
Sorry but someone must have written this for Biden.
There isn't anyone from a swing state who could provide what he needed. I'm almost positive this won't be an all white ticket. So no Warren. I'd love susan rice but she has baggage. And I promise you Biden knows who got him thru the primaries so it will probably be a black woman.

omg good job biden boi!!!!!1
I don’t care who Biden’s picks. Every Republican needs to be voted out. Over 146,000 Americans are dead because of their incompetence.
There is no reason to have remorse.  This is the very reason she’s a strong candidate.  Biden isn’t going to want someone who backtracks.  He wants someone with a spine who stands by her words.
I’m 100% certain Biden heard what Kamala said to him on the debate stage and she still made his short list of VPs.   This is politics. He’s not looking for a VP who is going to stand next to him and just nod and smile.  Wake up, people!
Aging and diminished joe Biden. Lolz. Have you people seen or listened to trump?
How to take seriously an article that calls Joe Biden who is clearly in much better shape than trump aging and diminished.
I am female, white, suburban, mom. My neighborhood is diverse, vibrant, educated, middle class. People stay, if a house goes on the market, it usually sells quickly. Biden is a perfect fit for my vote. DJT is a criminal and s/b in prison.
And they are coming for the suburbs.  Law introduced by Obama &amp; Biden, but POTUS refused to enforce.  Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, or AFFH.  Using this law as and add-on to HUD, O'Bidens plan to invade suburbs. Take over local Government of towns, cities and burrows.
refuse to account, will be denied state &amp; Fed assistance, like education and roads.  Feds will force communities to build multi dwelling, low income buildings, at your expense.  They will outlaw single family homes as White privilege.  This is Socialism!  This is Biden's plan.
Rice might make a better match with Biden in office, the winning is going to be difficult. W/ all the republican tricks, trump could lose the popular vote by 30 points and still win the election. Thus the best campaign should be almost the entire consideration
Biden will never do an interview unless he gets all questions first
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made max donation to Socialist.Marxist/Democrat Joe Biden?  No surprise.  NBA depends on China for a billion fans &amp; cheap merchandise.  Merchandise produced by slave labor, minority group Uyghurs.  Ironic,BLM supports slave labor?  Joe supports China.

AG Barr is just slowly exposing the most corrupted administration in the history of the USA.  The Obama Biden administration! No wonder that the Democrats hate him.  But nobody is above the law! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Democrats Hypocrites!
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.

The choice is stark. The most prolific liar, the most corrupt and inept POTUS In History or a very competent, honest and caring politician in Biden.
And all 19 believe Biden vs none who believe anything Trump says.

JACKASS!He did all kinds of crooked stuff that you would never acknowledge!Including setting up his legally elected Presidential replacement!Three years!Russia?Lawless is how I would describe Obama and many in his camp!While w/Biden you won’t dignify an answer to any questions!!
So he apologized. No one mentions Biden’s MANY problems w/ the truth,holding up a BILLION to Ukraine to fire a prosecutor.And the history of LYING about his schooling along with his lack of accomplishments!This man has been on the wrong side of history his whole damn career!#LIAR
Facts:Biden 50 years in government with 90’sCrime Bill hurt Black People and Family’s all over this country. Against the second black justice in history! The rest of his career is a black hole! Trump? 3 years in government. Most successful President in history! You are the TROLL!
You gotta be kidding! My Five year old could run circles around Biden . He’s a loser, abuser, blackmailer and has been Proven the Biggest LIAR in the history of the senate! Not 3 degrees, not top of class, but near bottom! In short, a corrupt EX-Senator who should stay that way!

What a nonsense!  It's very good that Joe Biden won't be the President and the puppet of the left mob in the White House! Hard to get a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is even much worse than her.
Wrong! Trump is right! I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
I agree with that, portnoy probably should have told him. But I believe his personal politics and animosity towards Potus is what’s driving this. If portnoy interviewed a high level lib(like Biden) without telling him, something tells me he wouldn’t be so triggered.
In NH, the key will be if Sununu gets through and wins a 3rd term as Governor as Biden blows Trump out for President.  If he does, he holds all the cards. He could decide to take a shot at the White House lesving the door open for Ayotte-Hassan II.....
Hello. Thanks for the tweet. Here's the rationale. If Biden blows Trump out by 10+, it would mark the biggest landslide by a Dem in a Pres. Election since LBJ over Goldwater in '64 (60-39). 2 yrs. later Republicans had a huge year....
Another tweet to promote Trump by Maggie! Disgraceful! I never send Biden or Obama on her account! I could be wrong !
Analysis | In nearly every swing state at this point, Biden is outperforming Obama and Clinton
The difference is the width of one of Biden's leg hairs.
It's surreal to think the President's former personal attorney, who's now reportedly under federal investigation, would team up with a crew of Kremlin-connected Ukrainians with a record of spreading conspiracy theories. Yet, somehow, that's what's going on
By getting Joe Biden to talk in public more.
The left mob has exposed themselves totally! I can't imagine a normal family who will vote for Joe Biden, who will be completely controlled by the left mob!
They did the same thing last time, and if you watched FOX (which I don’t anymore) you would know they have many personalities and board members that can’t stand Trump.  Murdoch’s son just donated 1M to Biden
Have you watched Fox? They have moved more to the left.  Murdoch’s son just donated over $1M to Biden, Paul Ryan (never trumper) is on the Board, and they did the same thing with their polls in 2016
We need a president who isn’t a lying, senile, old fool.  I’m talking about you Joe Biden.  You are Joe Biden.
Are the rumors true that the Obama administration helped support the Wuhan lab with tons of taxpayer money where without our support they could not create this bio weapon and turn it against us. Hmmm Biden family has strong ties with China also!!! Strange!
I live in IL a blue state. In the NW Chicago suburbs. There are no Biden 2020 signs, bumper stickers, billboards, t-shirts, NADA. Almost everyone I know, including my 18 year old son and his friends, are voting for  Polls are fixed. We are the silent majority.
While we await formal charges against Biden and pals from Ukraine, I’ll take what’s behind door number 5 Sperry!!
Who cares. Regular citizen when he said that. Biden was in politics. Besides, what groupie doesnt want a billionaire to grab them by the pussy. I’ll wait!!!!!
It needs to be done before the election. If not and Biden wins, these weasles will be forgotten and will become lobbyists while the rest of us watch out taxes soar above 40%. 401k’s will be taxed. This is the reality
Y'know, Biden served as VP for 8 years and they were some of the best years America has ever had.  The tweet just doesn't make any logical sense. Biden is a known commodity, bunker boy!  If he wanted to "destroy your neighborhood", wouldn't he have done it by now???
So masks or Biden?🤔 I'll take a mask every time!! Honestly, anything that gets us out of this mess short of voting for a Dem is ok with me. 🤷‍♀️
I certainly hope so. I hope they throw Comey, Brennan and Clapper right under the bus! Then none of them rolls over on Clinton, Biden and Obama.
I was saying the same thing. I live outside of Chicago, I have been in different parts of IN 3 times in the last month. I was in Columbus 2 weeks ago. NO BIDEN 2020 ANYTHING. All I saw was one ratty old  Obama Biden 2012 bumper sticker. We are the silent majority!
Can say the same for the DNC. They are so far left they don't even know there is a middle anymore. Just look at Portlamd. That's how all US will look if Biden wins. Bad guys running things. Taking and destroying what you have worked hard for. No thanks!
I trust him 100% He is NOT in this for money. He wants to make things better, &amp; get rid of crooked politicians. Clinton was a deceitful, conniving rat who was ONLY in it for money and power, just like most of them. Biden has had close to 50 years &amp; he has only bettered his family
Same! Plenty of cool white suburban women do NOT fall for bullshit -- you can believe it! Joe Biden, here we come!
Your playbook for ads is to rebrand pictures of Portland and say this is America under Joe Biden. You think people don't know where those pictures are from. We are not blind.
But Cuomo really did an A+ job? Joe Biden is still hiding in his basement and can’t speak in coherent sentences

Because Biden is going to win. We don't want to primary our own parties sitting president. I totally agree with your assessment of her though. She is amazing and relentless. After watching her speech today, I believe she will be the countries 1st female President, but in 2028
If Hillary Clinton is more qualified to be the President, so why she is not running the 2020 election??? What has changed? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... After another 4 years of Trump's Presidency the left would say again that Joe Biden was more qualified.  Hahahahahahahahahahaha..
My question remains: Where the hell is Hunter Biden? #whereishunter #ukrainejoe #obamagate
Who will  Biden and DNC try to impeach this time to keep this out of the news?

What funeral? The divisive Obama Biden political rally?!
I will wait until Biden is Oresident before I consider a vaccine!!
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
This has been talked about for months... Biden accused him of this months ago.  There are no provisions to delay ...so we shouldn’t expect anything less from Comrad Trump.
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
If my aunt had balls she would be my uncle.  This is the dumbest topic of liberals.  Give it a rest.  Just go back to supporting joe Biden with your pro liberal agenda.
Biden can pronounce ‘Minneapolis’
It won’t be needed ...when Biden takes over, he won’t need that and all the other useless spending trump and his wife in name only want!   We are in the middle of an economic crisis and this jackass is trying to cash grab on his way out!
It’s nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.
As if they will be around to spend it...  Melania is really bored ...perhaps she is filming a new reality show....  Extreme Makeover - WH Edition!   She has a new tennis court and rose garden for the Biden’s in the works...  why not a new West Wing for Trumpy!!

What has Obama and Biden done for blacks in their 8 years, tell me?

AG Barr is just slowly exposing the most corrupted administration in the history of the USA.  The Obama Biden administration! No wonder that the Democrats hate him.  But nobody is above the law! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Democrats Hypocrites!
Biden was stumbling through his 1 hour press conference.
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.

Yup but at least it’s not bull from Biden.
My point is if Biden has any brains he will put country before internal party power and he will make a unity VP pick. We don’t have the luxury to be fussy. That’s my point. Biden must be a leader and unite the party! So that we can vote blue no matter what!

That’s on Biden not voters. It’s Biden’s job to unite the party. Plenty of progressives or social democrats he can pick like warren or Barbra lee.
That’s on Biden to unite the party.
She and Harris would be a disaster. I won’t vote for Biden unless he unites the party with a progressive pick as his VP.
The choice is stark. The most prolific liar, the most corrupt and inept POTUS In History or a very competent, honest and caring politician in Biden.
And all 19 believe Biden vs none who believe anything Trump says.
Father- what do I tell my fellow Catholics who will not vote for Biden because he is pro choice?
There has been chatter for months he is going to have Nikki Haley as it will be a better alternative to Biden &amp; a woman VP.
Biden had a Stroke recently!

And Trump begged foreign leaders to manufacture dirt on Biden. Trump was impeached for it.
I think he is trying to keep Biden out....
He doesn’t have to do anything to prove to me he is capable and better qualified than trump!  Biden speaks eloquently...and above a 3rd grade level!
Screw that...  he doesn’t need to appear on FAUX News..  He doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone!  We already know President Biden is coming!
Joe BIDEN IS BELIEVED TO BE A PRACTICING Catholic in spite of his total support for abortion rights by 46%. Is that weird or what?
If they have any sense at all they will vote Biden. Trump is killing over 145,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump has done way more wrong than right.

If Biden has decided on whom he is picking, he needs to announce ASAP. This has been a dumpster fire of a process.
Absolutely. Biden will definitely have his work cut out for him when he beats Trump in the election and is then tasked with cleaning up the mess that Trump and his regime' have turned our country into.
This implies that you know better than Biden which candidate will produce the most excitement. So tell us, who will that be?

Biden held rallies. Obama didn’t leave any PPE stockpiles, and had no national testing strategy despite H1N1.
Again, not a supporter, but I heard this kind of rederick last time around. It may be wise for Biden to get those swing state voters to think about if Trump made good on his promises to them...and to not select a socialist running mate.
Timing played a crucial role here, as well as the fact that Biden received pretty much zero critical coverage after Super Tuesday.
Wouldn’t the more effective strategy be to attack Biden and undermine his legitimacy by launching non-stop investigations starting now? And arguing it’s important to retain the Senate so that Biden can’t get any appointments through?

Definitely, &amp; intelligent people can decipher this ploy. Regardless of what he claims in the end, I’ll be relieved &amp; thankful when he’s gone. He’s been an embarrassment, the antithesis of what a POTUS should be &amp; stand for. Although I hope it’s Biden, anyone’s better than Trump.
Biden should pick Hillary Clinton for VP
It could have been easy. Biden picks someone without any vetting leaks. Now, the vetting process will stain the VP nominee regardless whom it is. If the nominee becomes Vice President and possibly President, there will be some issues noted in her selection in the history books.

Alyssa, have you thought of making a scented candle that smells like your vagina?  Joe Biden isn't the only one that wants to sniff you.  You could donate all the profits to Planned Parenthood.  Just an idea.
You know what's great? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE WOMEN WOULD BE FABULOUS. Let's let Biden make his decision then support it 100% confident that many of the women mentioned will be members of a fantastic Cabinet, team of Advisers and Congress.  #RidinWithBiden #DNC
Call me greedy, but this is still 3-4 points lower than will have me feeling comfortable about Biden’s chances.
LIKE N SHIT....
I WAS JUST ABOUT 2 SAY THAT.....
Big donors in her district. But yeah, Biden-Bass ain't happening, praise Xenu.
I'm in. Are you behind this? Because I am. Accepting and adopting proposals from progressives, from climate fighters. Push our leaders, no matter who, to help us improve.
Not if his replacement is Biden, whose entire record suggests he'll work just as diligently to harrass minority communites and expand genocidal empire abroad
Biden's vetting team is terrible.
Shocked, frankly, that Biden and his pals are old white dudes.
That is exactly the point. Picking Kamala won't cause anyone  to NOT vote for Biden and if it does, they weren't voting for Biden to begin with.
Is he talking about a different Joe Biden?
LIKE N SHIT...U KNOW THE DEAL😷😷🤪😷🤪
NEW WATCHDOG.......
Wondering how many law obiding citizens will be afraid to vote for Trump to avoid the violence that might follow. Progressive Democrats accomplished their goal of herding the Americans into the Biden corner by projecting riots and violence against them for voting their consience.
I mean Biden has a long crappy record that can easily be criticized.
Quite frankly, Rep Clyburn was much more in tune with the base that brought Biden the nomination and his thoughts on this should matter a whole lot more.
There is a push by some people for Biden not to select Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate because she have presidential aspirations and that she might not be loyal. My question is have they ever push to disqualify a man because of presidential aspirations?
Florida Teen ‘Mastermind' Among 3 Charged in Massive Twitter Hack.
I would argue Wisconsin is since it’s arguably the toughest of the three midwestern states for Biden to flip
The fact they would ELEVATE  a black woman so she can only  be dragged in a attempt to block one who  took Biden to task on his Dog whistle at a fundraiser.....  Man.
and Gates and Bezo's are Cool with this....Microchips e coming under Biden,so they will able to control us that way...like wont let us use our digital currency.....Parody....hopefully!
I have a feeling the Court won't be so deferential to Biden.
Outside of Twitter that question isn't even within sight of Dem voters' radar screen. Which Joe Biden knows no matter what Obama says.
LOOK AT PICTURES, &amp; LAUGH AT WORDS...
Think im fuckin playin. Im done Joe Biden gets nothing from me but a vote unless Kamala is on that ticket
Keep spewing left wing propaganda.Obama(worst president of all time)funded terrorist organizations with cold cash via Iran, and the worst president is backing Biden,who has been a political waste of space for 40yrs.Keep burning cities while dividing the left and uniting the right
You just proved yourself a liar and Joe Biden correct in one tweet
No one: No one ever: 🌹s : Nina Turner should be VP. Biden&amp;his campaign:
Murdoch is the son of the founder, right?
The Constitution was shredded long ago. Trump is the result.  Neither Dems or Republicans care about the Constitution. They are about expedience of power. Sadly, Biden and Trump are not much different.
BOTH GOP....
The tax return issue is simply financial voyerism. A wealthy guy becoming president is much less interesting than a guy like Biden, who's never done anything in his life, and is a multi multi millionaire on a senator's salary.
President Biden, would you please snatch our precious Medal of Freedom from off of Rash Flimball's neck so we can wash the shit stain from it's history?!?!?🤗
ALL MUST GO...
Lifelong native deep in the heart of Progressiveland, can attest that Dor has it right. The Sandersnistas are neutered right now because of how RVAT have grown and become more vocal. If that holds through November, Biden can win _and_ can then govern from the center-left.
Kamala is our VP! No one has worked harder, nonstop, addressing all the inequality and corruption with Our Constitution, from this current Administration. She suspended her campaign and went into Overdrive for Biden! Crown Our Queen, Joe!
Kamala has a lot of support on Twitter that’s for sure. If Biden were considering men (which he’s not), I think the most winning ticket is Biden/ Buttigieg. Seriously.
Only mistake Biden can make with his VP pick is elevating an unknown and concentrating national attention on her in an intense public vetting process. Has to be Warren or Harris, or maaaaaaybe Duckworth. Really though he should just go with Warren
I love The Lincoln Project, but ads about Trump's health are wrong and they remind people that Biden is older than Trump.
This view is ignoring the fact that we have a duopoly, and the only way to remedy this is with something like #RankedChoiceVoting.  Vote for Biden now.   Support #RankedChoiceVoting in the meantime.  And be able to vote your conscience in the future.
Bernie Bros say no to Biden   I still think they remove him on or near their Convention,   They can't trot this dude out there, there's no way your gonna tell me Joe Biden is gonna beat Trump   NOT A CHANCE..   (TRUMP 2020) 🇺🇸 MAGA 🇺🇸 KAG 👍
I’m really not ready for Biden to announce his VP tomorrow, especially if it’s who Politico accidentally leaked the other day... I can’t do it
Lots of signs in Michigan --  Biden and Trump
Joe Biden is further left than Bernie Sanders, so says the Trump campaign.  If you needed any more proof as to what a liar this man is, this should put that question to rest....
He and his wife just gave $3 million to Biden Super PAC. There’s a hint
I'm sick of my TL being full of people bickering over the VP pick.  Biden just needs to pick someone and I will give it two days for twitter to argue over it and then we need to move on

Ask Rep Clyburn.  He’s more in touch with the Dem base that delivered Biden.
There have been several metoo allegations against biden and they all went straight down the memory hole because beating trump is more important than not making rapists president
Even these two know Biden has no mind anymore.

He’s also giving money to Biden, so it’s not like this is a surprise.
I don't know if it was a tactical error exactly...it won't look like one if Biden wins, I guess.
Maybe Biden just shouldn't pick a vice president.
But Joe Biden is running on the most progressive platform ever!

The audacity! They claim that things will be so bad under Biden while ignoring the fire their leader started and continues to ignore...I’ve not seen anything like this. Ever.
People are reading it wrong, as in 72% of Biden’s votes will come by mail. It’s 72% of mail in voters will vote Biden.
i really perceived it as the gold watch for biden, and that HRC was next in line
right, but like... was the selection of biden meant to be obama choosing an heir apparent?  at the time i thought it was more "reassure moderate white democrats/buff foreign policy credentials"  this election the VP slot absolutely should be used to designate an heir apparent tho
Biden is not the guy to throw curve balls. if there's an obvious choice, he makes the obvious choice.
This is not satire. This is a “grassroots organization” with a “mission to (begrudgingly) put Joe in the White House.” And it’s no surprise that there is little enthusiasm for Joe “shoot them in the leg” Biden.  On…
Harris is conventionally qualified for president, she and Biden get along, she's Black,and she was vetted in the presidential nomination contest. Also her seat is really straightforwardly safe. and she's the right age. She's just the most obvious choice.
It's very sad not being a pedophile alone makes you the best presidential candidate. That being said I'd still vote yeezus over biden
They creating too much excuses.. in fact they are the one doing fraud scheme. Old tricks! They want to create other Wikileaks but sorry.. President Biden 2020!
President Biden, would you please, early in your Administration, get our medal back from Rash Flimball so we can scrub the shit stain off of it?!?!?🤗
Biden is smarter than this, my guess is it's all planted bullshit from the left and right horseshoe of idiocy.
Harris is the more conventionally qualified choice. Just doubt Biden will buck that.
When Biden tanks the economy, you mean?  Why wait? You've got that now.

Karen Bass, A Potential Biden VP Pick, Praised Scientology At Church Opening In 2010  via   Biden has two criteria for VP: Ovaries and Brown.  She meets both.  As does my cat!
The (lack of) enthusiasm narrative being pushed around Biden is misleading for a variety of reasons, but, the most important and often overlooked reason, is that it’s just simply not a good predictor of turnout. See article below for more.
Vote -JOE BIDEN  Biden is a true leader.
Joe Biden ran in 2016 and lost!
I definitely will be voting for #Biden because my future and my children’s futures depend on it!
like, Biden is the opposite of unpredictable. if there'd been some huge scandal around Harris, that's one thing, but "she wants to be president" ain't that. she just spent the last year running for president!
Please do this Biden.  It would rule.
biden's going to pick Harris like he signaled he was going to do from the beginning.

Nope. He's operating out of reality. Point blank, Biden or Trump is going to be president Jan 2021. We all know who the most vulnerable people are better off under.

I don't really care who Biden's VP choice is as long as he chooses someone who is qualified. He should not drag this out given because the process is a dumpster fire.   Given the events of this week, I think will be Rice. Rice is "simpatico" with Biden

Given that I’m still waiting for the middle class tax cuts Trump promised 10 days before the mid term election, I am positive there will be nothing of value from Trump, ever. Biden has my vote no matter what.
Both Harris and Rice would probably be fine Presidents if Biden kicks it, I'm just saying I can see a good faith argument for why it's desirable to have a VP that won't shift into campaign mode in 2022 and won't plan on being prez in 2024.

Not yetttt by it’ll be basically Biden vs orange
Except he’s not a Biden supporter he’s just making his profile look like that to make them look bad. It’s obvious he’s trolling from the comment and his profile he retweets maga stuff
Biden is not a child who requires constant adulation. Your boy Trump is a sad little mess.
Biden is already Center enough,
only voting for Biden so I can stop reading the same tweet every other week:
The four that made sense to me three months ago.. before Biden's campaign flipped over Floyd.  Like black Folks gonna stay home over a VP pick.

Obama's call to end the filibuster reminds me a lot of when Biden came out in favor of same-sex marriage in 2012. Obama framing this around voting rights gives Biden the cover to support it down the line without spending too much political capital on it.
I think the list of crimes by Trump and his cronies is far longer and better documented than anything Nixon and company did. Can you imagine a report that Trump hired people to break in to Biden’s office being a story for more than day or two?
if you seriously thought joe biden was gonna give you 2 dogecoinss for 1 i have some beans i want to sell you
Biden VP -  is a good choice  and  are needed to remain In the senate.   also a good choice. But my choice  I can’t find a single reason I would not want her as Madam Vice President.
They also say Biden's years-long working relationship with Rice is not to be underestimated, particularly given how he has emphasized wanting a partner who is "simpatico with me."
Biden is kicking tRump’s ass right now! tRump is losing in all polls, in Fox News polls. Again I say, he’s Winning! We are voting blue this November. Get ready for the Blue Tsunami!

Harris tarnished herself at the Kavanaugh hearings. She’s a detriment to the Biden ticket.
The cowardly way this is being done makes me sick to my stomach.   Biden's in process of blowing a layup.
Biden has refused to commit to defunding the police, he as only committed to police reform
One Democratic aide with knowledge of the search process offered this blunt observation: "Biden allies are laying the groundwork for the vice president to have a reason to not choose her."
Her record as prosecutor was fine.   Biden campaign punked out to BLM.
Yeah, if Biden invited me for burgers, I bet he’s cooking them himself
I guess they’re still at it. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Biden, Bernie forces clash during convention meeting
When Biden deports and drones your poc &amp; working class friends’ relatives you will feel shitty so just don’t do it. Instead vote local and uhhhh burn down the White House.
After Biden BAILED on her after her record having a shield came out.
“Don’t split the vote” &amp; “you’ll give us trump if you don’t vote Biden” is petty bourgeois propaganda That has been ingrained in us since birth! ELECTORALISM IS INHERENTLY BOURGEOIS. a protest vote is more meaningful than Biden.
Biden isn’t even President yet, imagine what it’s going to be like when he is in office!
I hope President Biden pick you Secretary of State..  .

We don’t have elections in the US. We have coronations. The Democratic Party doesn’t even try to hide their corruption anymore. Somehow, people will STILL believe Joe Biden has their best interest in mind. He was *selected* not elected, and that’s why he will never get my vote.
more viewers than #biden gets from his basement!
Facts don't matter to Darcy. Agendas (even unfounded ones) and talking points are all that matter. And the "I'm voting Biden" rhetoric is just laughable.
Today during the #covidhearing America just saw on how left-leaning #Fauci is. Jordan asked him a simple yes or no questions about the protests and could they contribute to the #COVID19 , and he just avoided the question. Fauci might as well put a BIDEN 2020 on his car.
Hey  - can you pause from your pivot to fascist boot-licking to comment on this article you wrote 3 months ago?
Seriously, the “too ambitious to be VP” stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
I'm not sure. Thinking about what Biden wants in a VP, Rice fits the bill. I don't see a reason for people to trash Harris if she is the pick.   I just want Biden to announce... :(
Biden is +15 above, but Dems can still use all its expertise and screw up this one too.

LOL. I had dream a few weeks ago that Biden did pick me and I thought he was crazy for doing so. I'm only 36 and nobody knows me. My coworker, who was his advisor in the dream, was coming up with strange ideas for it to work out
You embarrass your own political understanding any time you describe what Biden says as "far left." Please, at the very least, try to make your criticism accurate.
NEUTRALIZE A POTENTIAL BIDEN ATTACK!
It has been reported that Clyburn supports Harris as VP. That has significant weight.   Clyburn has said that Biden will make the pick, it is possible that Clyburn is now publicly lobbying for Harris, but knows Rice is the likely pick.
Answer: It wouldn’t. They were both elected in the same ticket. Biden can’t just fire his VP.   After all, we don’t live in a feudalistic society where the next in line murders the person in charge just to obtain power.
3. Ambition ≠ Disloyalty  So Senator Harris has ambition. She wants to get things done. How would her ambition cause her to be disloyal to Biden?
The first morning we wake up and Joe Biden is the President of the United States we can take a breather for a moment ☺️
I don’t believe Joe Biden understands just how infuriating this nonsense is for women, Black women in particular. He may not say anything until he announces (a mistake in my opinion, should have BEEN addressed) when he does, he MUST repudiate all of this in no uncertain terms.
Biden says dead people are voters too.
Idk what the hell joe Biden opposes... he might be a roach farmer or child molester
It has been reported that Clyburn supports Harris as VP. That has significant weight.   Clyburn has said that Biden will make the pick, it is possible that Clyburn is now publicly lobbying for Harris, but knows Rice is the likely pick?

You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Bass is a good contender - doesn't overshadow Biden like Harris or Warren might.
To all    ‘bros’. If you don’t vote for the Democratic nominee then a vote for Trump on the other side will go uncontested just like in 2016. If you’re not gonna vote for  please educate yourself on how elections work.
Trump was a neophyte, Biden has known every VP from Eagleton/Shriver on
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
Possibly the most demoralizing thing to happen around Biden's campaign is the emergence of dinosaur vultures like Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd now after 4 years of hiding
China owns Biden   Add this to the list of reasons I'm voting for Trump
I hope this is the case. There's also a decent chance that the day of Biden's election will be marred by widespread white supremacist violence, possibly including mass shootings.
Nothing should have leaked. Maybe have that fluff Politico piece on Rice and then announce tomorrow.   Trashing Harris is really bad and I think Biden is behind it since he isn't doing anything about.     Regardless whom Biden picks, he should announce ASAP!
1/20/21: Trump is dragged whining &amp; crying out of the White House, refuses to attend the inauguration of President Biden,flies at taxpayer expense back to Mar-a-Lago,boards a private jet bound for Moscow where his handler, Putin,has a dacha ready for him. Fleeing to avoid arrest.
Kamala - just another politician. 👎🏾Rice - a DC lifer. 👎🏾
a bunch of people are not going to vote for biden because he is too conservative and the dnc is going to look at vote totals and go "we need to move even further to the right, look at how many republicans there are compared to democrats!"
liar.    in march you said go out and spend money at your favorite bar/ restaurant.   joe biden, literally as dumb as a rock.
See, stupid crap like this shows how you think this stuff is a joke. Biden can be creepy just like Trump... that’s not guilt of sexual assault. You’re a joke
Lmao!  You were hoping to run against Bernie, so you could just run on "anti-socialism".  You didnt get your wish, so now youre trying to make Biden look more socialist than Bernie?  You pathetic loser. 😂
Kamala sucks but the Biden campaign "allies" need to be abolished. They are mostly dogshit.
Really? People will not vote for Biden if he picks the wrong VP? Horseshit.
I might die since I lost my job and have no insurance. I'd still die under Biden since he said he won't fix that.
Meaning Kamala will be more effective. Think Biden was silent in meetings with Obama? It is also the job of the VP to be the chief advocate and defender of the President and who would be best at that?
Agree. She’ll play a big role in Biden admin. She reportedly already is. She’s a team player, not a show horse.
I'll donate to Biden's campaign if for some amount of money I can spit on him.
don't be ridiculous. after comrade biden forms the bureau of real middle american reeducation, chief justice dzokhar will oversee your (very brief) capital thought crimes trial! best of luck, friend!

Joe Biden will do as he's told by his handlers.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
But there is no evidence at all that anything about Biden has ever been "radical."
Biden’s aim is “American workers racing to dominate the global market” for clean energy. If we think about climate action as a competition, we’ll fail. And as a bonus, we’ll end up in great power conflict by reinforcing the constraints of the global economy.
“Any climate plan that pits the U.S. against the world in the midst of a truly global crisis, though, can only kick off a race toward a warmer, uglier future.” —
you Biden will lose, force a recount and then lose by a greater number? Yeah that's okay
Just looked through Darcy’s TL - Obama bashing, anti-BLM posts, and lots of posts about Chinese dog trade. Maybe they should stick with animal cruelty issues and that seems to be the strong point. There is no ways that is a Biden voter.
I'll keep saying this, this a dumpster fire. This is a dumpster fire of a process. WTF is this?!?  Biden can pick anyone he wants and he needs to announce ASAP.
I have 3 words for you: President-elect Biden
Please tell me that's not true.  Who did she promise and WTF does Biden care he's most likely 1 term and done? Di those white boy voices carry more weight than Symone and Karrine? He better recognize who brought him to the dance.
I respectfully disagree vice president isn’t second fiddle put you directly in line to be the next president if something happens to Biden or in four or eight years
Repubs: OOH Trump gets so many points for showing up to this interview and "enduring" the unfair questions. Lets see Joe Biden do that? Blah blah. Trump can do nothing wrong. His supporters hate the fact that we've had a successful black president twice that much.
No such thing. Funny how only right wing can get a pass for past associations. Trump has called Epstein “great guy”, partied often w/him. Trump has lots of associations w/shady people. Y’all only care about Biden’s assoc w/guy that died decade ago. Live in the now. Not yesteryear
Biden ever coming out of the basement??
I really think Biden should announce his VP, whomever ASAP. The news cycles is going to suck and then it will be over, but it is better than having terrible news cycles for the next two weeks and during the convention.
No I haven't. It's just the roles are now reversed.   In 2016 the Hillary +12 were outliers and in 2020, Biden +4 is the outlier.
If they ll do Harris like this....Any other black woman isn't exempt.   It's why I was  OPPOSED for so long to a black woman VP.  Biden is a Ed Burke type dem.  I grew up around this shit.

There ya go!! Glad your finally admitting the big difference between this new trade deal and failed nafta which corpratist Biden voted for..
Same. I'm just about done with these crybabies who say they won't vote for Biden unless he picks "their" choice of VP. Joe Biden could pick Vlad the Impaler as his running mate and I'll still vote for him.
I research folks records..... and Biden was only good to block Sanders and Warren.  He did that.   He has no more use to me.
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.

Biden can say. “I’m the ONLY ONE on this stage to NEVER have BEEN CHARGED WITH RACIST DISCRIMINATION nor have TWEETED WHITE POWER CHANT VIDEO.   True stories. Sad. Add to that wishing “well” to a pedophile and you have Election disaster brewing. Know what I mean?
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden is also a rapist.
mitch trubisky said this is the first time he's adjusted his mechanics, kanye tweeting about abortion, trump tweeting things about biden i wish were true, all occurring right at the same time I have my abruptly early Friday afternoon empty stomach cocktail

So tell me why this is Biden’s fault.
Ha ha why do you keep bringing politics into this. Im in no way a political person. Beetlejuice country, uncle biden. They're all crooks in my eyes!!!
Although I’m not a supporter of  being aselected as VP,  but this hot job by Biden’s world is incredibly damaging to the cause, and unhelpful on being the party together. #StopTheLeaking
The thing is that I think Biden already decided on Rice, but won't announce it for another two weeks, ensuring Biden's VP rollout is the story for two more weeks. Announce the choice now and the fallout will be over sooner rather than later.
This wasn't the work of a prophet. Anyone following the news understood this in real time. It's not like it was a secret that Trump was taking resources away from the CDC, &amp; pulling resources  out of foreign countries where outbreaks will happen.  Any tweets of Biden's solutions?
Would love VP Bass for the sole reason that #KHive would have a total meltdown.
Old multi billionaire who is jewish &amp; buys ppl's alliances on both sides to get what "HE" wants from incoming admin. Probably he bought off biden long time ago. Not sure why he didnt stivmck $ behind  but most likely #Bernie against his income resources/dirty cash.
It's crazy that Biden at 50% AND plus-4 is the outlier. Trump really fucked this reelection bid up badly.
He's doing a great job and I plan to vote for him again. Not a chance I'm voting for Biden, no matter who his running mate is...

He barely depicts historical references in his diatribe correctly. The party of division and racism has always been the Democratic Party. They embraced segregationists and even the kkk. Ask Biden and Hillary about Senator Byrd. He served til he died in 2010! Biden eulogized him!
Chris Dodd really does need to STFU; we definitely agree on that. I like Harris as VP but would support any Biden ticket. Really am sick of ANY so called Dem casting aspirations on any fellow party members. There’s too much at stake this year as we need to bury Trump/GOP in votes
Karen Bass is cool and pretty bad-ass, but she gives me a real Tim Kaine vibe. She's complementary to his style, but won't bring the kind of energy Biden needs as ballast to him.
How great Biden is?   He can read. That already puts him ahead of Trump.  You need more than that?
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
I hate when people assume Biden wouldn’t run for a second term.
Theres no excitement or energy for Biden. Admit it.
It is very disrespectful how Obama used John Lewis' funeral to urge us aboriginal (misnomer 'Black') people to vote for Biden - the same demon that not only raped women, but also helped in passing the 3 strike laws which further destroyed our families in the 90s under Clinton.
Ummmmm I’m a Biden supporter..
Like Biden!They are the same age!
not voting Biden or Trump
Biden is just as Old!
Agreed! And with Joe Biden being of the age that he is at, we need an obviously qualified number two. Who could step in at any moment and obviously be prepared for 2024.
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Does this sound like a man suitable to lead this Country? You be the Judge    has yet to be held to acct on any if his racially charged comments   You cannot go to (DD) unless you have an Indian accent, I'm from a slave state   (40) YRS OF THIS GARBAGE  BIDEN EXPOSED ✔
I think it really depends on how powerful Dodd and Clybourne are in the room. Apparently neither one really likes Harris. I can also see Biden being amiable to the idea of not picking a designated successor, as Harris and Rice would be perceived.
Duckworth was disastrous as the head of Veterans Affairs in Illinois. Financial mismanagement and a lawsuit for unlawful termination of two "whistleblowers." Let's hope Biden steers clear of her.

How is it misogyny to say Kamala comes off poorly at times?  She doesn’t have the same authenticity as other VP options.  I’m a Republican and am considering Biden, but it entirely depends on his VP pick.  Kamala is a dealbreaker.  Certain men would have been dealbreakers too.
Don't count out Duckworth in Biden VP race | TheHill
Biden would be Tweeting lies daily!
4/Most of the photos of Joe touching children are a. photoshopped, b. pictures of his family and/or people he's known for years, c. photos of nothing.  My Dad was a touchy guy, reminded me of Joe, and that doesn't mean he was a rapist.  Same with Joe. You just hate Biden.

3/her story that Joe said something about her breasts at an event that he wasn't at. The fact she had corroborators doesn't mean that Biden was actually there. Reade's corroborators either changed their stories to match hers, only corroborated her first story, or were coached.

Joe Biden for President
I’m also doubtful that Biden would move left. But I do think he’ll incorporate a far more diverse cabinet than we’ve seen. But I also think local elections are potentially more important for our day to day life. Voting in young, LGBTQ, or BIPOC people to those roles is crucial
Boomer Dems really need to get over their red scare hysteria. The only people still scared of communists are never going to vote Biden anyway.
If you think Joe Biden is going to pick Bass y’all are either politically inept or just wishfully thinking.
Went out the window with the Biden nomination.
#Biden/harris2020
See, from what you were saying I assumed you were going to share Biden admitting to the thing you said, and not only the part of it that was all over the news.
Trump or Biden?  Military Strength/Preparedness-TRUMP✅ Security from Terrorism-TRUMP ✅ Economy &amp; Jobs-TRUMP ✅ Law &amp; Order-TRUMP ✅ Energy Independence-TRUMP ✅ Border Security-TRUMP✅ Social Security-TRUMP ✅ America First-TRUMP ✅
CAN NOT WAIT for Biden to take office so he can tell us we need to heal and build bridges to this murderous sack of assholes
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Don’t make me laugh. Biden solving problems??? He can’t figure out what day it is. You people are nuts.
Obama and Biden turn their backs on the coal industry  removed the restrictions.
Would you agree this - involving DNC icons and friends, while having your propagandists in media &amp; Obama/Biden's FBI covering it all up are disgusting?  Will you make a statement soon about this? #Epsteinfiles #savethechildren
Biden ordered Harris to be trashed.
I’m very confused as to why we’re talking about Biden? I’m not a Biden supporter lmao. You guys just can’t admit any wrong for Trump, it’s okay to say so.
BIDEN IS GOING TO LOSE
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
Susan Rice is listed as a top choice for #Biden’s VP pick. Who is she?  -Former US Ambassador to the UN -Former National Security Advisor -Brought climate change and #LGBTQ right to the center of #US foreign policy at the #UN
Kamala is fucking dynamic, and she will give life to Biden’s campaign.
Who would believe that raciat asshole. I hope Biden wins so we don’t have to hear about this creepy man
I mean, I'm in Illinois so that's going for Biden no matter what. But I'm not voting for him. I will still go to vote down-ticket of course. Gotta have my day out. Love 2 Democracy.
We need to all be like Joe Biden and never leave the basement!
They listened to her; they didn't give her a solution. Listen, Biden and Obama are GOOD men and solid Humans; there needs to ACTION. Words are boring and not actually helpful. We are listening to a lot of talk now and it sucks. #Biden2020
The wtf was about watching him squirm and fold under a little pressure. It was like watching biden try to complete a sentence. And so many people believe his fake ass.
Rep James Clybourn “We do not have a national strategy to combat the Coronvirus. Trump isn’t followings virus exerts like Dr. Fauci, but instead is following a personal political agenda.” We need a President Biden now to enact federal mandates and save lives. VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN!
NOVEMBER 3, 2020   VOTE -  JOE BIDEN A True Leader who cares about the American People, not how much money he can put into his pocket.   Joe Biden won't lie to you about the economy, unemployment, the GDP crashing, the TrumpVirus, nor will he blames others for his problems.
Oh my GOD! 😂😂😂😂  They drunk off polls at the Biden campaign! 😂😂😂
They want LOSE Florida! 😂😂  Biden ALREADY WEAK with Brown voters... you have Brown magazines and publications saying Harris for VP but let's fight about Castro?  In a state where Nelson and Gillum lost because of POOR BROWN SUPPORT with a Latina LG?!
If you find out what his policies are be sure to tell Biden.
maybe, when Angela Davis and Noam Chomsky say that you should vote for biden you should listen.  If the iconic intellectuals of the movement you purport to  ahdere to say that you should support someone maybe you should?  or is Angela Davis just another sellout dem to you?
Rep. Karen Bass is listed as a top choice for Biden’s VP pick. Who is she?   -Former Speaker of the California State Assembly  -1st black female leader of a state legislature  -Helped lead California out of the 08 recession -Chairs security &amp; foreign affairs-focused committees
me, a person who has been saying we should be excited to vote biden bc of the female vp hes going to choose: ah well nevertheless
As Joe Biden nears a decision on his running mate, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth makes an unusual pitch on Fox News.
If we all spent just one tweet every day to say something kind about those we disagree with, we would literally transform the platform and the society it influences.   Just try it. You won’t be harmed. Swear. :)  #OneLove #OneWorld #OneHumanity #OneSpecies #Trump #Biden
I also think Biden's strength in the polls means he actually has more wiggle room to make a pick with more governing chops who may not tick every "electability/likeability" box.
Everyone is looking through rose colored glasses. Biden doesn't Harris running President on Day 1.  "Biden also told Obama aides, that 'Barack would never have to worry" about him positioning himself for another presidential run."
Are you voting for Biden?
and now biden is running for president.
SOCIAL SECURITY IS FUNDED BY EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS... GOVERNMENT SHOULD KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF OUR MONEY 💰   PRESIDENT TRUMP VOWED NOT TO TOUCH SOCIAL SECURITY ✅ JOE BIDEN, FOR 44 YEARS, HAS TRIED TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY 😡
two hundred laura loomers handcuffing themselves to their local biden field office that no one on the campaign has even been in since feb
Fair enough, but doesn’t that create a Tim Kaine problem: doesn’t help get out voters and makes Biden spend weeks introducing Bass to voters?
Amy largely wasn't hit outside being a hard ass boss.   I pushed Biden Klobuchar HARD for months after Harris dropped out because I didn't want black women treated by a 1960s Democrat in Biden and his orbit this way.
While Trump’s tweet, “if we had no testing, or bad testing, we would show very few CASES”, is laughable, he’s still a better choice than what Biden and the dems would bring. Why would you vote for a pro-criminals, pro-illegals, anti-gun, and anti-police Democratic Party?
Hell yeah you did.  And it was Elizabeth fucking Warren, who would be amazing.
The rioting cowardly Biden lovers are treating our great USA exactly like the way they'd prefer to see it become permanently  #MAGA #KAG2020
The election isn't that close right now. Biden might feel able to choose who he wants for VP regardless of election consideration. VPs make no difference in elections.
Not going to be useless when. Biden needs to step down during his first term and she takes over; or Biden is  a one term President and she gets the reins of the DNC for 2024.  It’s important in a possible Biden Presidency.
I’m not the only one who has noticed....
This may or may not be the same woman.  Not sure.  I’ll never vote for Trump.  As a Biden, supporter, who is this woman?  Has she said anything publicly about these photos and interactions?
The 1st thing I read about Bass is she got along with Rep. Kevin McCarthy when they were in the Cali House. Are u f--king kidding me? Are we gonna walk this road again? Please tell me Biden isn't going to reconcile with GOP traitors. Please.
To provide an offramp and excuse not pick her.   "One Democratic aide with knowledge of the search process  offered this blunt observation: "Biden allies are laying the groundwork for the vice president to have a reason to not choose her."
Biden can pick whoever he wants, but picking Karen Bass is like Hillary picking Tim Kaine. It won’t help him motivate voters at all.
Biden can pick whoever he wants, but picking Karen Bass is like Hillary picking Tim Kaine. It won’t help him motivate voters at all.
yeah its not like there are dozens and dozens of photographs and videos of Biden making women and girls uncomfortable via physical touch or anything of the sort, thank goodness for that orange man bad amiright?
LOL. ALL the Biden allies are trashing Harris. This comes from the top of the campaign.
"[I]t’s a lot easier to be inoffensive when you’re a man."  This  oped has stuck with me all week. Will some of this change if we elect a female VP and normalize the idea of a women so close to the top job? Man, I hope so.
this guy is and was a long time buddy of biden and clinton. go drink some more koolaid
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
I'm for Kamala. I believe that should Biden choose her it will be difficult. I also have faith and Biden &amp; Harris will manage the challenges well. Moreover, I see a Biden/Harris administration as strong and formidable as the Obama/Biden administration was. We could use that.
Why did he apologize to black voters in SC.  Because he was wrong.  Again Biden dropped Amy like a hit potato over her record and you think Khive is what sank her VP chances!  Grow up.
bullshiters are putting themselves in front of the line like Deus Ex Machina. We don’t need this palace intrigue when all should be focused on the Kremlin stooge treasonous con man. Again, why would Biden rely of these relics when  is around.🤔
I think you are misinterpreting what Biden wants.   Biden may NOT want a VP running for his job, Day 1 after the Election.   "Biden also told Obama aides, that 'Barack would never have to worry" about him positioning himself for another presidential run."
Biden never leaves his basement and never does press conferences. So what exactly are you guys "covering"?
Yes, it's been an afterthought to coronavirus and Trump's attempts to delegitimize democracy. Biden can pick my dog for all I care
Circumstances are different, Biden may NOT want a VP running for his job, Day 1 after the Election.   "Biden also told Obama aides, that 'Barack would never have to worry" about him positioning himself for another presidential run."
VPs don't matter electorally. Biden wants someone that is simpatico with him. Rice fits that bill.  "They also say Biden's years-long working relationship with Rice is not to be underestimated, particularly given how he has emphasized wanting a partner who is "simpatico with me."
Again, I’m saying why old white dude corporatist grifters are circling around the  and  Where were  and  when Biden was left as roadkill before being rescued by Black women. How can we get people motivated and out en mass when these
You are about 20 years off, m8. Also your observation makes no sense. What's wrong with finding joe biden to be a fake ass bitch? He's basically trump without a lot of the baggage. He isnt perfect and I sure as hell didn't vote for him during the primary. It fucking sucks.
also i understand the argument that illinois doesn’t necessary need to vote for biden because it’s already a blue state so maybe we discuss what it’s like for those who don’t have that option
The party would have been better off if Biden had instead decided to choose the less-threatening-to-Chris-Dodd man-ambition of a Cory Booker or Juliàn Castro.
Many thanks 45, thanks to you made Joe Biden a shoe in for a Nobel. Don't be mad you sold your soul for money not for a peace maker. You said you love chaos and there is no Nobel for chaos. Fool.
Susan Rice or Elizabeth Warren would be to 2 best vp picks for Biden.
Biden needs an excuse not to pick Harris.   "One Democratic aide with knowledge of the search process offered this blunt observation: "Biden allies are laying the groundwork for the vice president to have a reason to not choose her."
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
In my lifetime alone, H.W. Bush, Gore and now Biden have all run for president after being vice president. But HEAVEN FORBID A LADY DO IT.  Honestly, the promise of selecting a woman was always empty to me but this past week has made it even worse.
i understand not wanting to vote for biden because of who he is / accusations  but isn’t having trump in office another term just going to make things even worse for anyone who isn’t white/privileged and/or rich  i just don’t see it any other way at this point pls share thoughts
Biden isn't pick Bass.
Who SHOULD Biden pick for VP? Who WILL Biden pick for VP?
You may obviously believe what you want.  If you want the truth about this whole mess, it's out there.  If you hate Biden so much that you need to believe this ridiculous b.s., that's your business. 1/2
This election isn't about whether Biden is a great pick or not.   It is about restoring the basic dignity of the Office and preventing 4 more years of damage to the nation's democratic fabric.
It makes a difference.  The Dems can’t give away Senate seats, which they would be doing if Biden picks Warren and they win.  Harris as veep nominee would not endanger her Senate seat.  Both are up for re-election in 2022.
"That commitment could assuage concerns in the Biden camp that he might be overshadowed by a running mate positioning herself to succeed him."  This is the only point of being VP! Cool, we'll give you a woman but not one who will contend to be president.
Dodd is pretty close to Biden, I doubt Dodd would undermine Biden. Rice is the pick.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
I would be stunned if Biden picked Harris after his allies trashed her this week.
I think Rice is the pick. Biden always talks about being "simpatico" with his VP. Rice is "simpatico".
Nor does Bill,Billary Clinton,The Obama's ,The Biden's.....They are running Scared...they sold out,and now they must deliver or else!These people dont play.Andrew Bourdain did not commit Suicide...He was about to tell on them....
I'm a liberal but I feel very much the same way as you do! Sure, it could be nice to have a progressive, especially after this national nightmare, but moderate and respectable and competent will more than do for me. #Biden #Biden2020 #RidinWithBiden2020
That's all this is.  They want The VP front runner to be humble and loyal to Biden and the Obama brand.   That's politics.
Picking Biden makes your case quite well.
"FEAR MONGERING" until it actually comes true...  via
He had to apologize!😂😂😂  Joe Biden doesn't do that much.   No remorse... that's Dodd talking for Joe and Jill.   Apparently he felt his dog whistle wasn't wrong because Obama made him his WWC insurance after Hillary bust his ass with white no college in the 08 primary.
For the horny Joe Biden fan in your life
AOC isn't eligible.  Why should people be mad that Biden isn't considering someone who is not eligible?
If Bozo Biden picks Harris for the VP. slot, it will be mana from heaven for us. Please Uncle Ukraine!
Thing about me is I support whoever is president, supported Obama as well and will support Biden if he wins, I'm pro America my man.
Rep. Karen Bass fought for Blacks and Latinos in South Los Angeles. Now, she’s on Biden’s VP shortlist.
Biden literally could end this tomorrow if he announced Rice tomorrow. The story would quickly die instead of lasting for another two weeks.
I won’t comment on recent reports one way or another. However, IF a black woman is NOT chosen to become VP. You’ll lose! Black folks will stay home.🤷🏾‍♂️ #BlackVotesMatter #BlackWomenMatter #bidenvp #Biden
Huff Post protects corrupt Biden.
I can only reiterate-- if it's not Kamala, I will lose my damn mind. HIRE THE MOST COMPETENT WOMAN IN THE ROOM YOU COWARDS.
It seems Biden's campaign diesnt think that   Bass is a black Warren! 😂😂  That's all.
Privileged is thinking Biden will be  much different.  The working class will barely survive 4 more years of either as president.
Biden is responsible for this. He must have of ordered this. No way, all these people leaked this stuff without his permission.   I thought Dodd either went rogue or was the fall guy and they were going to announce Rice tomorrow and after a few days, we would move on, but no..
It is widely known that Joe Biden is a doubleplus Marxist
Should be  for President, not Joe Biden, anyway. But just about anyone is better than the GOP choice.
Biden and his campaign think they get away with this and still win. Of course they can get away with it, but that isn't the point. The point is that this been dragged out and now destructive. WTF?!?
I can’t see a scenario where Biden wins and we don’t get the senate. That 2014 ass kicking brought in a few GOP not ready for prime time senators. Look at Ernst flailing around
It's almost like all accusations should be investigated. Trump's 26 rape/sex assault accusations and Biden's possible 'groin grab' and Clinton's unspecified (so far) offenses should be investigated. Only one is the President, however. And that matters. Accountability matters.
Well I never said I liked trump.. I just think he’s the lesser of two evils
we're going to have the lowest voter turnout ever and that's partially your fault for endorsing Joe Biden.
This is the dumpster fire that Biden created, he literally could have not leaked anything and picked Susan Rice tomorrow if he wanted. WTF?!?
I think you’re overestimating the veracity of that attack since they called Biden and Joe Manchin communists.
I should add that I think it is very important for the VP to be a Black woman or a woman of color, but the first consideration has to be fitness for the job. Also, I think the VP needs to be of a younger generation than VP Biden. It's time to make that move.
California paper urges Biden to pick Karen Bass over Kamala Harris for running mate
My money is on Susan Rice, to cement Biden's "I'm practically Barack Obama" BS, satisfy the MIC, and guarantee that nothing will fundamentally change, even after Biden kicks the bucket during his first year in office.
“Voter fraud is rare in the United States, and mail-in voting is not a new or untested idea. Five states — Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, and Hawaii — already conduct voting primarily by mail.”
People really are like “GO OFF BIDEN! WE STAN!” It’s so sickening.
“Why won’t Biden pick this Fox News host?” is a question that answers itself
Benghazi will NOT HURT RICE.  Castro can HURT Biden in Florida.
Also, is it suggesting that Biden should pick Juan Williams or Ana Navarro?
Also that assumes a Biden administration would pass meaningful legisltion which, lol
Joe Biden and the ghost writer of Obummer’s speech, his husband Mike
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
11. With so many people unemployed, they actually had time to stand in line all day at the polls.  12. Maybe one polling place for all of Kentucky was too much.  13. The Russians were really helping Biden.  14. Those phony mail-in ballots from China got stuck at customs.
This is only harmful. Biden must really effing hate Harris.
Love LOVE the new Biden ad going up in Youngstown, Ohio today! ❤️
As promised, I'll help you forecast Biden vs Trump so we can position in equities.  This one: positive for Biden.  "Economy on Wrong Track" gave Trump a victory in 2016, though "Right Track" in 2018 didn't help GOP in midterms.  Wrong Track again. Not favorable for the incumbent.
IMO, it is clear that Biden wants Rice, but he wants humiliate Harris by sending his allies to trash her. Just pick Rice and move on. This is really effing stupid.
it's a tongue in cheek criticism of Biden and the way neoliberalism pervades the Dem party which makes me 🤮
Joe Biden drop dead bitch
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
LIKE N SHIT
Obama pushed for tax hikes and a national health insurance mandate. Biden wants tax hikes and a national face mask mandate. But Trump is the “authoritarian” in these lunatics’ minds.
BlueMAGA is ad hominem because you are attacking the person instead of their arguments. Its a smear meant to incite the person instead of encouraging actual discourse   And tbh idk who its fooling because most Biden voters I know are the farthest thing from MAGA cultists
The Veepstakes is a fun little distraction from the torments of daily life, no?
Oh look another troll...biden hiding in his basement....LOL
Before pandemic - lowest unemployment for blacks EVER- greatest economy EVER - yea joe Biden will do better #HidenBiden
I'm sick of the guessing game, but my irritation is not aimed at the Biden campaign. It's at the wailing and gnashing of teeth of people clawing each other over something they have zero control over. He'll pick who he picks when he picks her. No matter who it is, she'll be great
Yes  and media should all want to see joe Biden /trump debate. No honest journalist will  give Biden any excuse to back out !
Ive been called a rape apologist (as I know many others have) a dozen times over for both - saying I support Biden and questioning Tara’s story
I can't wait for the morning I wake up &amp; it's Joe Biden who is President.
The Bee argues that Biden should be concerned about gender harassment claims against aide, Larry Wallace, that Kamala Harris‘ office settled for $400,000
Obama/Biden added 8.9M jobs w/152.3M employed. Only 142.2M employed as of June 2020. Simple math: 152.3 &gt; 142.2 and 142.2 - 152.3 = -10.1M jobs LOST. So, thanks for endorsing  for Prez!  Donate    To support a real job creator! #VoteBlue2020
OK FINE I'M BUYING A BIDEN SHIRT
Biden’s VP pick will likely be  or  . Karen stopped the construction of liquor stores and encouraged construction of small businesses, affordable housing, and nonprofits In South LA. I would have no problem voting for  with either choice.
I think it is pretty clear that Biden wants his allies to trash Harris for the next two weeks and then pick Rice who is his pick. Biden clearly knows who he wants. Definitely not Harris if he is sending his allies to trash her.   This is pretty petty.
I don't think these are mutually exclusive positions. It could both be bad optics and set up attack ads from Trump, and Biden and his camp could also hold a grudge. It doesn't have to be either/or.
Okay, but surely there must also be some down side to the Biden presidency...
Ultimately, it serves to de-legitimize the election for everyone. So, yep, that's probably how it will play out. That being said, Biden making restoring a functioning Post Office would be a good campaign issue, that cuts across partisan divides.
Hello USA 🇺🇸  Are you tired of: Distraction?      Deflection?           Fearmongering?   Lies?                 No Leadership?  Doesn't our Country have enough going on without all that?  We can eliminate all it!!!  🇺🇸 Vote - JOE BIDEN 🇺🇸  #BLUEDOT #wtpBlue  #ONEV1

Assuming that R Congressmen &amp; Senators don’t rally behind a close Biden election win and / or (as Biden earlier said) that the Secret Service is NOT willing to usher these folks out of the WH - the only real and timely recourse is people power.
Harm? 😂🤣😂. The guy said “grab em by the pussy”. Tweeted a white power chant tweet. Didn’t say shit to Russia about bounties on our troops. Wished a pedophile well. Took the advise of “alien dna” quack over his own admin docs and Biden is more harmful? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂
I'm not that familiar with Karen Bass, but I pray Biden chooses Kamala or Susan for VP!
She does... She could have SAID no To vetting if she didn't.  Revenge is a dish best served cold.   Folks are gonna try to humble the Black woman that made the white savior apologize.  Pelosi called Biden "Authentic" after that Eastland shit. Older black voters know the game.
Having to vote for Joe Biden feels like... being at a buffet that only serves my least favorite foods but I’m not allowed to leave because I’m a hostage. I make it for 48 hours not eating anything, but by day three I crack and I’m just crying and shoving cabbage in my mouth.
Fox news slammed Joe Biden back in April for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election. Awkwwwward
We don’t need rallies. We already know what to do, or haven’t you been paying attention to the polls? Biden has such a lead in EVERY POLL TAKEN that they can’t possibly be wrong and Trump can’t possibly win. Even Republicans are saying, WITHOUT THE AID OF RALLIES,  “He Gotta Go”
What I'm getting from this, that Biden is likely to pick Rice and wants to humiliate Harris for the next two weeks instead of announcing Rice as his VP in the next week.
Feinstein backed Biden over her own senator 😂😂  Durbin had OBAMA'S BACK.
joe biden team ghostwriting shady af subtweets
Hello Chris Dodd!  "One Democratic aide with knowledge of the search process offered this blunt observation: "Biden allies are laying the groundwork for the vice president to have a reason to not choose her."
Obama: Vote for Joe Biden, this election really counts.   Also Obama:
So either way, it’s a win/win for the country. He’s yanked out kicking and threatening people and Pelosi or Biden are in charge.
That's true. Biden is the president. Trump is a prisoner. Simple.
This is why Biden needs you for VP. You work well with all and you are qualified. No other is. KH, nor EW. Both of them divide the nation. It is time to start addressing issues  and not dividing us.
Best advice: resign. That is only way to prevent losing to Biden
If Biden wants Rice, just pick her already! Trashing Harris for another two weeks doesn't help the campaign, regardless of whom the pick is.   This process is really getting to be petty.
YES PLEASE. Ban Biden plz
It was a pointless attack. If you're going to attack Biden on segregation to push school desegregation or some kind of education policy, then OK. If you're going to do it to push T-shirts, that's just a dirty attack. She had the same education positions as him.
Biden announces a wild card pick for VP that no one was expecting. Who is it? Wrong answers only.
First Ditka, now Singletary. If Trump gets the Fridge on board, I don’t know if the Biden offense could punch through the ‘85 Bears defense
This has me chortling. More chickenshit cowardice from Biden and his people. This reminds me of Hillary picking Tim Kaine. They're going to suppress the enthusiasm of their own base with this petty nonsense.  SMDH.
Obama will be the shadow President if Biden gets elected. Why do you think that dope, Susan Rice, of all those being considered for Biden's VP, is a finalist? She will be Obama's eyes and ears in the White House.
All democrats care about are farmers in the Midwest and that’s on Biden
If Biden had the commanding lead CNN wants you to believe he does...VP wouldn’t be such a big decision.
Only HARRIS can convince Biden to pick her...and she'll have to do  something  she isn't used to doing.  Apologizing. Folks won't let Miami go. She forced him to have to apologize.  Old white folks HATED that. They are setting the why the VP front runner wasn't picked lane.
47 years of racist, molester, senile Biden isn’t enough for you? He hasn’t made the union more perfect in his 47 in government...all of a sudden he is going to do it now?
I didn’t know it was possible for me to want to set my eyeballs on fire after reading this. This is more of the same tactic of Shut up and vote for Biden you baby. F off. Seriously. I’ll vote whatever way reflects MY conscience. YOU deal with THAT.
“If children’s lives are at stake you’re going to prioritize them” Obama. Weren’t you the president during sandy hook? 20 kids killed ages 6 and 7. What did you do to stop gun violence? Biden? What about you? Great work you two
there was a viral tweet about how hot some Bernie voters thought young Biden was (?!?), this is a response to that presumably
So you prefer the older Biden on your tank tops?
Harris rice... if they can't let Miami go (I'll forever be a Harris fan and never vote for Biden because of that Eastland dog whistle) pick Susan.  Rice won't cost us a state.
Canada's political and social mores most closely resemble the US and reflect American influence. So the Liberals split the difference between a party that is full of what would be moderate Republicans and one that's aligned with Bernie-AOC. That's your Biden-Harris party.
I wouldn't vote for a 71 year old black woman in 2024 the same way I'm not voting for a 77 year old Biden or 71 year old  Warren  in Illinois.
So can we bring up the fact the University of Delaware still hasn't and won't release Joe Biden's Senate record until 2 years after he retires! We need all the information on ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE OUR PRESIDENT! Nobody should get special treatment! Idc if we need to get trump
... better chance of influencing and enacting policies under Biden than under Trump.  Dems have a chance to control all three branches of government and actually pass stuff.  You can bitch and snark or try to make the best of a situation.
here’s an idea! stop blaming ppl who are voting downballot in Nov. for Tr*mp! MAYBE instead, let’s point fingers  the real problem - choosing between scum of the earth and joe fucking biden, both of whom are sexual predators. sry but isn’t it a politicians job to earn ur vote?
She went there and worked.  I agree that Bernie’s Cuba comment probably got overblown and Florida was trending to Biden anyway, but this is a problem.
look we don’t want biden but we need him ok
Fair enough. I still think Trump runs with the ads and she said it, so I hope Biden's team is prepared to counter that and hard.
I've seen a few people say that how people feel right now is important because of how many mail-in ballots will be used in this upcoming election. I think Biden would normally be peaking too early, but he might just make it.... Again.
Wouldn't it be great if Joe Biden were to pick AOC as his running mate.  That' would be a mind blower.  She's the last of the New Deal democrats.
Miss Piggy would be a much better president than Trump or Biden, and Kermit for VP
Going to disagree here. I think whitmer veepstakes people are over logical 538 nerds that are like "it increases biden's odds in Michigan by .074% therefore she's the most logical pick"
Not only is this evil, it is criminal. And the Biden administration should treat it as such.
Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden
Kimmie...saw this and couldn't resist;  Overheard in the Oval Office: "We don't have time for another 50 years of mistakes by Joe Biden, " Trump said.  "So I'm committing myself to screwing up  the country in 4."
Since when is Joe Biden a socialist? Also I dare you to define socialism beside being a bogeyman you use to scare people who vote Trump.
Dems are much better and prepared with that than GOP. The risk Biden runs is he cannot please a very big Democratic tent
Black people have been getting used politically for years by Dems to our detriment. That continues this election year. Democracts have put up the worse candidate for issues of impact to Black people. If you don’t believe me look at Joe Biden’s draconian record on black issues.
Suburbanites, double haters, college educated white men / women are significantly breaking for Biden. They will also start voting in September rather than on election day (debates won't matter). If swing voters vote early then election day will be all about base turn out.
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
His handlers were afraid he'd mistake it for Strom Thurmond's funeral.
Just because you want Biden doesn’t mean the world is going to come back together. Not as long as government has the control that it does.
And this is shocking to who?
also the dumbest fucking thing i've read in an overlong fb back and forth was some toenail saying that supporting m4a is a privileged position since it dissuades voting for biden 😂😂
Yep... I say Harris and Rice too.  Bass kills us in Florida and Biden is SOFT with Brown voters as it is.
My take is people are hardened in their thinking on Trump. It's not gonna change views. Media is reinforcing the biases we hold. the real battle is turn out at the booth. Turn out high - Biden ✅, low - Trump ✅, average - Biden ✅ but contentious.
Great would love all Trump supporters to stay home. That won't stop the election just guarantee a landslide victory for Biden. Please boycott and stay home.
I have seen the numbers which is why I made the point. While true Bernie won handily in the caucus and CA, it was much closer in the swing states (for ex, AZ I think was like a 50-49 breakdown between Biden/Bernie)  But yes, Biden did have higher turnout and was further boosted
That would require admitting fault, which Trump would never do. Biden's campaigning on reform and better social services, while Trump's all in on the status quo. But who knows, maybe if Trump is still getting smashed in the polls in October, he'll pretend to care. This failed:
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
Really? I mean I think she's a bad choice but proximity to Obamaworld/Biden at least makes her a contender
Well they just might. If biden gets in and doesnt change things for workers then 2024 or 2028 is when we will see much worse than trump.
Then the I Got Mine Boomer generation cries when their shitty candidate loses. Keep refusing to realize why our generation is tired of getting our future fucked over. Sick of young people not voting? Don’t choose shit candidates and blame them🤷🏻‍♂️ (I’m voting for Biden relax).
Possibly Harris will be chosen b/c of her experience, energy, &amp; visible strength in Senate hearings, &amp; she's been working hard to get it. However, I'd like to bet on Rice. She has the experience/skills to step into role of Pres. immediately; she &amp; Biden have good long history.
How many MILLIONS of jobs have been lost on Trump’s watch? What have Trump’s sons done with their lives other than behaving like servile privileged little snots? How many millions of jobs were created when Biden was VP?
I know that folks want Biden, because he is not Trump.   I know people are tired and really want to go back to sleep.   But, people need to make their decisions with their eyes open. Biden is a "grand bargain" Democrat. One of his dreams is ending social security. #NoHelpComing
Come November they'll accuse Biden of being a Muslim, being a satanist, and of eating babies in a ritualistic Catholic ceremony.
Sickens me that he uses this man's funeral as a political campaign on the behalf of Joe Biden. The level of vitriolic hatred displayed by Obama and others towards Trump is just an example of the hatred that permeates the Democratic party causing TDS in nearly every one of them.
MURDER VS. LIFE  CHOOSE BIDEN, CHOOSE LIFE!  🚨🚨🚨ASK HERMAN CAIN WHERE SUPPORTING TRUMP GETS YOU!🚨🚨🚨
Did you read the plan that Bernie helped him create? It’s pretty decent considering Biden’s hugelyyyy centrist background. I’m just hoping and praying that Biden pulls through on actually making it happen😤😤
This is actually a TRUE statement!   Because the Biden administration will be in charge when it happens and they will get it done correctly.
Schumer and Pelosi add Biden should be call this out big time!
Especially if it's something as patently ridiculous as the claim that Biden is super far to the left (personally, I wish he was). It's the same playbook right-wing media pulls out every election.
Jeezus. Biden’s camp already signaled thru Chris Dodd they’re open to shoving the entire tRump criminal fiasco under a (very large) rug.  Worth keeping an eye (or two) on the former Senator.
Going to suck when Biden gives Trump and his senior administration blanket pardons after Trump refuses to concede.
"Instead of pointing to bestselling books or buildings on Fifth Avenue as chief accomplishments, Biden calls the 2016 decision by the University of Notre Dame to award him with the Laetare Medal..."
"Rather than achieving national fame for taking pride in telling individuals, "You're fired," one of Biden's most frequent refrains has been about the dignity of work.
"Instead of only showing up at houses of worship for a photo op, Biden rearranges his schedule to ensure he doesn't miss a holy day of obligation."
This quote at the end is EVERYTHING :)  "As the Biden campaign heads into November, it is attempting to offer a contrast of two candidates with radically different understandings of faith: Politics, for Biden, serves as a means of living out a vocation, not a vanity project..."
Splinter (RIP) reported on the comments before the Daily Wire did, and provided a more accurate version of what Biden was doing (taking a perhaps ill-advised dig at Sanders supporters):
via  “With the leadership change in the campaign, there’s understandably a review and fine-tuning of the campaign’s strategy,” a campaign official said. “We’ll be back on the air shortly.” Meaning- more lies and hatred.
Honestly are we going to start joking about voting for the bear mauling party bc they were the only ones to beat the face eating leopards if Biden wins or are we gonna pretend that when we vote against our own interests it is categorically smarter
Biden is also currently having to pay out 3 women who accused him of rape.
But in a fascinating/horrifying way, it was a chance to watch the way smears make their way into mainstream circles. You had Sen. Cornyn, a disingenuous Twitter troll, push the line out there (again, at no point did he "call" for anything like that).
100% fine with Kamala Harris as VP.
Hahaha. That's not ever going to happen. Maybe a slow down once he's convicted? Possible.   Why? Would Biden be bad for ambulance chasers?
What. Is. Hate?   So many people on this app operate with such vitriol, and it’s always for the same reason — they have yet to encounter compromise as a requirement.   Find ways to compromise, and watch as your hate abandons you.  #Trump2020 #Biden2020 #Trump #Biden #Comicsgate
It continues to disappoint me to see NeverTrump  conservatives fail to appreciate the stakes of this election. It's not about Trump-Biden. It's about our founding values and long-standing institutions.  Democrats are telling us what they plan to do and you aren't listening.
Only in the US can a center-right candidate like Biden be called a radical by the opposition.
i totally agree biden will be president TRUMP WILL BE IN JAIL...  #excellentyear #trumpinjail  #traitorpresident  #gopenablers
What the fuck is wrong with Joe Biden?
The Daily Wire writer edited a wildly misleading clip together and put up this story (which seems to have since been deleted by the site without a note? Unless they moved it?)
There’s a difference between maintaining appropriate good ties with the US, including being cordial with Trump, and openly hugging Trump and his project close. Johnson seems to have been more in the latter camp.
O u think its ok that Clinton,Bush and Obama moved our Businesses over to China for Cheap Labor and Hunter biden monitoring muslims in a Concentration  It! Gaslighter!
Had Biden been at the funeral,  he would have been expected to make the memorial tribute to John Lewis. Everyone in attendance knows Biden is unable to keep on point while speaking, and with his racially disparaging remarks in his past, he would have been seen the fraud he is.
So does Biden so don’t just try to take that angle
Exactly. Trump had the most winnable election opponent ever (Biden). And he's handled this so fucking bad biden might actually win.
how do you get this crazy? how can you associate this with a centrist conservative like Biden?
I wrote about it at the time. It was a pretty bland answer about how there *needed* to be compromise with others in government because what's the alternative? To start a violent revolution? If anything, it was a jab *at* people on the left.
Finally a reason to get rid of those pesky Ivy Leagues
Trump v Biden  Is actually   Cruelty v Decency
Also, what job did Biden get Beau? Or Hunter, for that matter?
But anyway, it reminded me of last year when someone at the Daily Wire tweeted out a clip claiming that Biden was threatening to "start a real physical revolution" if Republicans didn't cave to his agenda... or something like that?  And it was just... funny.
i dont understand why liberals cant handle critism of biden? people are using their voting power to try and push him to adopt actual progressive policies before the election  we SHOULD be critical of all politicians instead of blindly following them lol
Want to know what will happen to America if Biden and the Democrats sweep the #2020Election? Here's a picture. They get closer every day.
Biden has one claim of sexual harassment.  Trump has 25+. Want to try again, genius?
It's true. Either way, we win.  Either Pelosi(?)or Biden will look very good in that oval office, undoing all the damage President Village Idiot has done!
I think as soon as  is declared the winner, Trump should be hauled out of our  in handcuffs.  It will take time for the WH to be sanitized, fumigated and repaired so that President Biden can take occupancy on 1/20/21.
So one thing I'm seeing more of, which should surprise absolutely no one, is the line from right-wing/pro-Trump voices that Biden is some sort of super leftist socialist radical... or something ridiculous like that.
Do you believe the woman that accused biden? What abojt the DNC chair? That happened a few yrs ago and plenty of evidence of abuse.
What happened to the patriot act the homeland security act after bush and champs stareted a senseless was so halbuton and the bush family could steal the oil and then put mo bid 1,000 of times higher than if the had a bidding process .....now Biden’s brother is rebuilding war tor
Everyone on this planet lies, they even do it inadvertently. Difference is Biden can’t remember his lies. He’s taken on every position possible and is a well documented racist and a kid sniffer and you won’t hold him accountable for it.
Fox personalities were left eating their own words after Donald Trump's tweet.  via  Typical FOX Lying to their Viewers
How do we volunteer to be on the eventual 'Truth &amp; Reconciliation' committee??????  All I want is a Biden W come Nov- running a VERY Close second to that is a deep dive into every damn malfeasance these rat bastards have tried. Every email, every visitor log...let sunshine reign!
The nerve of the DNC to hang M4A out to dry and then run targeted ads begging for Biden donations. So sorry, asshole, I have to save for my 10k in yearly medical expenses after my premiums. Why don't you ask Anthem for a couple of bucks
You must be too young to remember when VP Biden and President Obama inherited the last GOP recession and took unemployment from 11% to 4%.  Then Trump took it from 4% to 19%.
Thank you Carmen, happy Friday 🙏🌺👍👍🏾
If Gore being blackmailed kept him from winning in 2020 &amp; Bernie from running as a 3rd Party candidate Mossad/Israeli gov absolutely changed the course of American politics leading to a highly dysfunctional gov &amp; America's 3 worst presidential candidates ever Trump Biden hrc
I hope owning Biden and Harris on the bird app is worth it in a year or so when we’re deep into his second term and most of us are dead. I’m logging off because far right and far left can kiss my ass.
in this black girl leadership seminar and kamala harris up talking about vice presidency with joe biden -_- lemme Tune out chile
We must never forget. When Biden wins, he must make it right for all those who did the right thing for our country at devastating consequences for themselves.
And you are in Amsterdam no no one cares what you think about Biden either! What is it with you foreign trolls who don’t live here?
And you live in India so no one cares what you say about Biden.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
Hey Biden, your plan on your website is mostly what  is doing.   ✅Free Testing ✅Development of a Vaccine ✅Deployment of personnel, supplies, etc. ✅Emergency paid leave ✅Support for Businesses  Only debatable topic = Free Treatment
sex is gross. i know none of u inject estrogen into ur upper outer ass cheek every week so u probably can't relate. but believe me sex is stupid and ur time is better spent praying for the fall of the US government. Ur too busy fuckin to see that joe biden eats landlord dick.
It honestly owns to work at the consent factory where you can one week make an argument like "berniebros are a result of stan culture which is the real villain" and the previous week have said "bernie has no control over raving pack of dogs that says they won't vote for biden"
If some of these guys were seen repping Biden they would get dragged too by the other half of the fanbase. That’s why nobody is doing it. It’s pick your poison. They should stay away from it or at least I wish they would. Nobody should ask Ditka to comment on anything ever again
No, a vote for a third party candidate is a vote for that candidate. Trump will not get a vote when I cast mine for a third party candidate. Nor will Biden.
You forgot Joe Biden.
Coronavirus US: Fauci appears at house hearing on virus 'raging out of control' – live

Exactly how will freedom be sacriced under Biden?  Can’t use the defund poice point as that’s debunked. But I’m curious about other specifics that prompt your post about loss of freedom.
5.Shelter Biden from P_debates [requested demands due to C19] 6.Delay [D] convention _strategic take-over of nominee post conf 7.Eliminate_delay POTUS rallies _term energy 8.Eliminate ability for people to gather _ divide  9.Eliminate ability to find peace Church closures]
He can't do that, especially when we vote for Biden in such numbers as he won't have a way to contest the results.
Their PLAN- calculated [D] political gain: 1.Eliminate record economic gains 2.Eliminate record unemployment gains 3.Shelter Biden from public appearances _limit public exposure of mental condition 4.Shelter Biden from Ukraine exposure _narrative change _media focus C19
I would prefer them not be in politics. I HATE TRUMP. I don’t actually like Biden at all so I would think it was a corny photo opp &amp; question the real motivation. It wouldn’t anger me, but I wouldn’t be like “Yes! Awesome!” It sucks to find out a hero is actually an a-hole.
The correct quote from Biden is “Truth over facts”.
This is why I say Biden's term will accomplish nothing but repairs. The census is just going to have to be re-done. There's no other option; no one credible is going to trust any bit of this data
HOW CAN YOU BITCH ABOUT BIDEN/DEMOCRATS “DEFUNDING POLICE” IF YOU FUCKING REPUBLICANS ARE “ALREADY DEFUNDING POLICE? “EXPLAIN YOURSELVES!”
Why were you silent when Biden was called out for being a pervert?
I know ⁦ ,you need to switch it up at the last second. The whole #TrumpVirus thing is really #Killing you. They obviously didn’t see the memo. -⁩ Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
My first comment was pointing out how leftists were going around calling anyone who supported Biden a rape apologist a couple months ago. “BlueMAGA” in itself is an ad hominem attack.   Obviously is capable of name calling and bad arguments but do you not see the irony here?
I know many people might not be thrilled about Biden as president, but I’m not sure what good whining is, when the country is literally being destroyed in every way, under Trump. You act like Trump and Biden are almost the same. When your house is on fire, it needs to be put out.
Remember when Biden said " I've seen Barack Obama " 🤣
Bernie did not win Latinos overwhelmingly, he edged Biden out but they ran pretty close. To his point, Bernie’s social media presence (and leftists in general) far exceed Biden, yet it was Biden who walked away with a much higher turnout IRL. Thats the point hes making.
Since 2016, Attorney Lisa Bloom tried to tell this story and media refused to even though there was witnesses!
The Trump calculus on mail-in ballots is this:  * Republicans discount the threat of the virus more than Democrats and other sane people * Republicans will turn out in person more than Democrats * Doing harm to mail-in ballots will disproportionately negatively affect Biden
I agree. Trump who believes in space alien cures and Biden who believes in real science. Trump is a racist pig and Biden is a very decent person.
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
The last five presidential elections were won by base turnout. The candidates who focused on centrist swing voters all lost. Biden's smartest VP choice is Bass for the base.
Bass will kill  Biden in Florida.
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
If this is the best Ronna No-Longer-Romney McDaniel can do, the Democrats will sin by double digits in November. Obama-Biden had the longest consecutive job growth on record. Trump, meanwhile, has created highest employment since the Great Depression, but gave jobs to Jarvanka
i agree with O'D. but, if only because of the climate issue, this isn't a "teach-a-lesson" election. This is "remove the guy who is gutting all environmental protections" election. and that's the tip in the iceberg. where i vehemently disagree is that Biden is the same as Trump.
I think some if it sticks. I'm definitely hearing a lot about "radical leftists taking over the country." The divide &amp; conquer. The "Biden might be ok, but we can't let the radical left take over everything."
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
Tara Reade.  Tara Reade.  Tara Reade.  I believe her.
You’re right, he will make Biden soil himself!
Joe Biden does not want to defund the police. Stop LYING!
So Joe Biden was there to be a figurehead and others will reply for him.  This shows just unqualified he is for the office of the President.
I'm fine with that. My preference is Harris, but Biden has my vote regardless.
Given Kamala's history of toxic based ambition including her Willie Brown phase isn't it likely these are paid trolls pushing her to be Biden's VP choice.
WOW! YOU CORRUPT MOTHER FUCKERS DON’T STOP SERVICING TRUMP EVEN AS HE IS TRAILING BY DOUBLE DIGITS!! SLANDER IS YOUR GAME! SHOW US PROOF OF BIDEN DEFUNDING POLICE AS VP OR SHUT THE FUCK UP! WE’VE HAD ENOUGH SLANDER, LIES, CONSPIRACIES, AND FUCKING CORRUPTION! PATHETIC!
Were you not paying attention for the 8 years that Obama/Biden were bringing the economy back from the last Republican recession? How many jobs have been lost due to Republican incompetence?
That's because the poll could be Biden 62, Trump 37 and the final result will still be Biden 50.1, Trump 49.9
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
Look, my decision is made on Biden and the top of the ticket because of Eastland... and a whole bunch of other things I'm holding petty Grudges about.   I'll LAUGH my ass off he picks a white woman over 70 after all of this....  AT Black people thinking he owed them something.
ever see the manchurian candidate? biden will be a useful puppet or resign before his term is over and hand the presidency to his VP. no way he makes it through another four at this rate.
Unemployment is over 13% and 32% negative gdp.  ALL UNDER TRUMP. It can only get better under Biden
I always respond to people with big platform’s tweets against Biden like this: hey that’s valid! But let’s always end it with BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT &amp; VOTE FOR HIM BC HE IS THEE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT CAN BEAT TRUMP. tell a friend.
I don’t think Biden and his campaign are incompetent enough to accidentally leak vetting process information. Why is Dodd still talking to the press after this story broke?
CW thinks that Harris is the pick which probably is a safer bet.   I didn’t think the denial was that strong. Regardless of whom is the pick is I would expect them to deny it.  The fact that Dodd is close to Biden would make me think that Dodd wouldn’t leak without approval.
I think you mean, “Is Obama‘s plan to keep Flynn off the campaign trail?” Because I doubt Biden is capable of making plans and I also fairly certain Obama has a stake in controlling the narrative.
So everyone does bribery why not us!? Do you not see how that is how we got to Trump in the first place!? The Dems are supposed to be on the side of the people. Neoliberals normalize bribery and we wonder how we got Biden..
Trump got folks sympathizing with a wartime President. That’s how fucked up things are right now. And once Biden is elected, Trump still has 2 more months to ruin more shit. Thanks, again, you spineless coward ass Senate Republicans.

"2020 Election Live Updates: Trump Can’t Delay Voting, but He Can Cause Confusion" by Unknown Author via NYT
If Biden and Harris can hold back the pro-Israeli lobby, they may have a chance at real foreign policy.
A sizable percentage of the electorate hates both men, but Biden wins those Omni-haters by a sizable margin. Trump won them in 2016.
You can’t be apart of the movement and vote for Biden ....IJS #aboriginalofAmerica
Yeah......that makes sense! 😂😂  The cat is out of the bag.  Post George Floyd,  White folks used other women of color to stop one black woman from being VP because they are sore Biden had to apologize for blowing a dog whistle last June.
Also, it’s really wild to watch these guys try to push this “Biden is a radical leftist!” argument. That would certainly be news to people on the left if it was true.
Oh me too man, I’m going to do another collection just between Khive Biden Bro’s and Bernie Bro’s. I’ll tag you when I post it.

And in Britain, how will a Trump-friendly government adapt if Joe Biden wins?
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn’t be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Biden and Obama? Haha! You tried it. Girl bye ✌🏾
Based on what I read and learned about Biden and Dobb's friendship, they're pretty close. I doubt that Dobb would do something without Biden's approval.   People need to prepare themselves for the fact that Rice could be the pick instead of Harris.
Another Biden voter
I hate Biden but I rather him than Trump
If you were at a sandwich shop and 3-5 out of 10 of every customer you see there looks at the menu, doesn’t like the options and turns around. You would be blaming the customer. That’s all your doing here. Biden bro’s slogan is “Biden, if you don’t like him, well fuck you”
Enjoy going bankrupt from medical bills under Biden!!!
No they weren’t. They weren’t this bad and Hillary isn’t on the ballot this time. He’s lost over 100 polls in a row to Biden. You should start panicking
What about Obama he loved Epstein’s island &amp; hotdogs &amp; pasta??
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
I’ve told them to go bare knuckles, they’re playing w/ kid gloves. I’m not saying Biden should doing it himself, but  should hit harder. I’ve yet to see an add that would say the GOP thinks Blacks were better off during slavery while denying them the right to vote.
Hi don’t suppose anything in the package pertains to Biden flying around the country with a convicted sex trafficker, raping underage girls along side his attorney,  ? Because THAT WOULD BE REALLY SCANDOLOUS!
You also won’t be able to do that until 2022 with Biden, but I guess he could lie, not uncommon for a campaign to do.

You’re crying about FRAUD! Millions of people vote by mail every year (including Trump). I will be voting by mail this year, I hope they have sometbing similar in NZ :)  A voting holiday isn’t happening this year, but there will be one moving forward once Biden is president :)
Agreed with everything   said. But it’s not  turn.  I think Biden lose with Harris. Trust and likability will be one of Harris biggest weakness. It’s  turn or  opportunity to step up. Bottoms pick is a bold one.
Tear Trump a new one!!!No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
IDC am voting for Biden no matter who he picks i endorsed Harris for VP but i ain't toxic
They creating too much excuses.. in fact they are the one doing fraud scheme. Old tricks! They want to create other Wikileaks but sorry.. President Biden 2020!

I hope President Biden pick you Secretary of State..  .

He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.
Cain didn’t die in vain.  His death sends a loud and clear message to Americans to vote Biden.
I will proudly vote for Biden no matter what happens am with you 100%
Maybe (her re-election is safely assumed). She could resign as Speaker, and the House choose someone else -- who need not be a member -- as Speaker, who would then become President Clinton... er, Biden...  At least that's how I understand it.

Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology? - The Bulwark
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
Everyone is tweeting #NobodyLikesTrump as if anybody likes Biden.
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
Well since Rachel Maddow is off this week i hope she enjoys the time off and gets plenty of rest she will need it for January when they indictments come and news stories of Trumpers being charged breaks news if Biden wins
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I’m watching Tucker Carlson now playing some clips of Biden.  For God’s sake the man is not in control of his faculties.  He’s not remotely qualified to be president
Why wouldn’t anyone mention the fact the Joe Biden is named in a criminal investigation in the Ukraine. Why wouldn’t the Senate want to look into that?
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
😂 Biden can’t form a sentence let alone have interviews and Mr. “Dictator of Disney” thinks he’s what’s needed?
Biden leading in Texas now if that lead holds on election day Biden becomes the president no matter what happens now we need to vote like our lives depend on it to make it happen
Oh I can not wait for the day you become our next President! My father is still waiting for results of his covid test day 13 at this point results will be useless!  There are so many issues on different levels that need attention but I am confident in you President Biden!
"Too ambitious" is when your Veep is actively trying to poison you.  Other than that, no.  Biden's 77; anyone who accepts that slot has got to be prepared to step up. Senator Harris would suit me just fine.
It originates with this  article. So many of these outlandish claims could be dealt with early on if we had a norm of discourse, that we expected extreme claims to subject themselves to the public dialogue of experts before either side spread them.
My guess is Biden will be a one term President (due to age). Keep a close eye on who the VP choice is.
Biden wouldn’t destroy the environment. Biden would restore our allies faith in our country. Biden would restore the economy (as Clinton and Obama did before him) Biden wouldnt allow the Russians to get away with bounties on American soldiers. I didn’t even say the T word.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
Well, that sucks. Obviously, that makes Putin happy. The only good thing is that a President Biden can reverse this.
CNN is showing Biden's note from yesterday this morning.
We wait til Biden makes the announcement politico has inadvertently gave the GOP a head start attacking one of his potential VP picks we can't give them anything
biden has dropped from -160 to -145 in the days since this tweet
I’d let Biden watch my dog, but never my children or grandchildren.  He’s lost.  His supporters must be planted, because no one could be stupid enough to think he’s qualified for President
Really? Biden to the rescue?
Your tax plan is toxic to business, large and small.  The Biden economy will be a disaster.  High taxes will force layoffs.  Heaven forbid you get elected

Trump once again failed our nation but you won't President Biden. Pray for you and all Covid 19 victim's often.
Actually I am fine with that. The Democrats won’t protect Americans if you disagree with them. YOU have professed to hunt down Trump supporters when your party regains your rightful place in power. WE need protection from YOU, your party and the senile corrupt Biden.
IF AG Barr were practicing partisan law like Eric Holder, Obama's self-described wing man, Hillary, Biden, and Obama would be in prison.
Barletta did overperform in Luzerne.  I think Trump is favored to carry it, but probably by a similar margin to Barletta even if Biden is winning the state by less than Casey did.
Yeah because most people protesting nazis have a swastika nearby .  They’re   supporters trying to spread their lies at Walmart.
Lucerne County, PA- Trump vs Biden
This article was really interesting.  General consensus is that Biden will win Lackawanna by a strong margin.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday he will not be attending memorial services for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis this week. So, we know what’s wrong with Trump. The question is what’s wrong with us? VOTE for a civil society. Vote Joe Biden. Please.
Problem is Susan Rice and Obama/Biden got away with all this! They’re not held accountable and won’t be charged with conspiracy to overthrow a sitting elected President!  shame!
1. Masks definitely work. 2. Hydroxychloroquine is very questionable. 3. This virus is serious despite what our dictator says. 4. Trump is far more mentally unstable than Biden. 5. Our constitutional right to peacefully protest is being threatened. You are fake news, sir.
There’s plenty that would be inconvenient to remember about the Obama administration’s role in the Russia-collusion investigation, writes
President Susan Rice🤔 I like Joe Biden he is the perfect safe bet for 2020 Especially in this case I look at th VP choice as a presidential choice. The WH is a demanding job Age matters How about a black woman intellectual as president?
Something else to consider.
That ad is a joke and Biden is a joke! Biden thinks he can be a leader?  Ha ha ha ! 😂😂.  Thanks for the laugh!  I needed that today !  #BidenIsAMoron  #bidenisapedophile
The cowards don’t deserve to win anything. Biden in the basement has more visibility than the Republicans in Congress who are in fear of the MSM.
Only the top 1% benefitted from Trumps tax cuts. THAT is a fact.   You saying Biden did nothing while in politics is not a fact. It is OPINION! You’ve provided no facts at all your entire series of posts.
Don't vote for Joe Biden
My boyfriend's dad is over 6 feet tall and about Trump's age and doesn't stand like that. Also, Biden doesn't form a coherent thought?
The Biden's taking time to be with Nancy Pelosi in honoring John Lewis's memory is touching she should have been the one to speak and Kamala Harris should have spoke instead of Moscowmitch
Did I miss something? Biden’s been President for 40 years? I never realized one Senator could fix everything! And if we wanted someone to accomplish nothing we would all vote for Trump strictly on his track record.
Law and order belongs to Trump. Biden owns this.
Chris Dodd needs to resign from the VP selections committee and hand over the job to someone more qualified like Amy Klobuchar she would make a perfect adviser one she dropped out of being in commission and she recommended that Biden should pick a person in color as his VP.
It's already happening proudsocialist has said he won't vote for Biden and he used to be a wonderful resister til the day he became a Bernie Bro
WTF Tlaib is not a real democrat for refusing to endorse Biden so starting now i am endorsing her challenger Brenda Jones just like I endorsed Amy McGrath over Charles Booker. Bernie Bros are electing fake democrats and trying to make our party toxic.
Prayers for those in hurricanes wake president Biden
Organizers expect those efforts will net hundreds more signatures, including from Biden delegates...
😂 You are deluded bruh. First Lady Jill Biden? She’ll be spending more time finding Joe’s memories.
Biden says Trump was the first racist president. One bullet in the foot. Now he appoints Chris Dodd to the VP selection committee. Another bullet in the foot.  Please, please, don't follow the traditional Democratic path of blowing a sure thing!
Solid favorite, but still Likely R. I bet Biden makes it to a 5% loss in this district. Went for Obama 2012 and Duckworth in 2016, and narrowly for Pritzker in 2018.  Brendan Kelly’s numbers in the rural counties last time were unimpressive.
Biden needs a running mate that will excite voters and that person is Kamala Harris. Elizabeth Warren would be a great VP but there would be increased risk of lower turnout among the black community and he needs someone young who can take his place and Kamala is the person.
What is the most realistic target for Biden in  "Lean R" category?
They gassed and beat American citizens for a photo op. Next time someone says they can't vote for Biden, ask them about this
Hmm, not a Trump support one bit or Biden. Doesn't matter who wins this election. We're fucked either way.
I think it's a good idea; Clinton won the state by only 2% and there hasn't been a lot of polling. Biden is favored in NV but it is worth spending in.
And will actually get worse if Biden is elected.  Will embolden them more as they'll see it as an endorsement.
Take a good look at this man. He is what Biden becomes if the Democrats win in November.
MSM is the propaganda machine of the left. Practice for becoming Pravda if Biden wins.
I’m not denying it is trending right. But Biden won’t be losing the county by 40%. It will probably vote to the left of the state.
Of course there’s a downballot lag- but even Jim Gray won this county in 2016 against Rand Paul.  Biden will improve upon Hillary Clinton in these kind of counties.  Remember- Elliott is an Obama 2012 county.
Not too hot of a take, but Elliott County KY is Likely R at presidential level; it was won by all the statewide Dems in 2019, and Biden at least has a shot there if he is keeping to state to 20%.
#TrumpCantKeepItUp the news that's coming to him Hurricane Hanna tore down Trump's wall he can accelerate the construction all he wants but the construction sites will be turned into bulldozing sights in 2021 Biden will tear down Trump's wall and Trumpers will be crying nonstop.
#BernellTrammell was killed for supporting  In Biden’s America such would be common place. November we should vote in honor of #BernellTrammell! #USA 🇺🇸
Stop fucking calling it the China virus asshole! It’s Covid-19! People have told you that this is offensive to Asians, why do you keep saying it! Truth be told, this is the TRUMPVIRUS!!!!!!!!!!  Biden 2020!
Hide till 2021 and let Biden run this Country
That says it all.  The man is in the twilight of his life.  His IQ and cognitive capacity are in the decline.  He cannot think on his feet.  A Biden presidency would be a disaster
I doubt Biden would veto a marijuana bill.
This is one of the few criticisms I have for Biden. It needs to be legalized and regulated federally like alcohol/tobacco.  But it’s ok because Congress may not agree- I think some Republicans may even come around, because it could be a fiscal/personal freedom issue.
People that refuse to support Joe Biden aren’t progressives.
1.Trump won't concede  2. It is true that we won't know the results for days and weeks 3. You are correct that we still have to deal with him til January  4. No matter what Trump does between November and January Biden will be sworn in no matter what happens he can't stop it.
He can try all he wants but he can't stop Biden from being sworn in on January if he wins
He should but why can't Pelosi fill in for him til election day then Biden
Harris is the most logical choice she offers a regional advantage she can help Biden win states like Arizona Georgia narrow down Mississippi and win North Carolina
The polls are showing 72% in favor of Biden. Can't wait for that Silent Majority (72%) to vote.
Dude, legit, I thank you for your service but stop calling yourself a conservative. No self respecting conservative would vote for the shit show that Biden supports.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Think about it. Trump is law and order and Biden is riot and loot.
Mr AK probably thought that firing warning shots (ala Uncle Joe “Get a Shotgun” Biden) was a good thing to do.
Yes .. Trump is President only Nov 2. 2020z Nov 3  is for President Biden.😂😂😂
I bet Biden keeps MN-1 within 5%. MN-8 probably within 10%.
Keep in mind, Biden will also probably do better than Clinton's ~2% margin statewide
Exactly, I bet Biden will narrow the gap in MN-7 to more like 15-20% than 30%- big difference. I also expect him to improve quite a bit in MN-1 and MN-8 (Trump will probably carry both districts, but not by 15%).
Yeah, Lean D is reasonable, I do expect Biden to carry the state, but anything more is way too presumptive for such a close state.
I agree, I think Biden is favored in AZ, but Kelly will outrun him by a few percent.  McSally is basically screwed unless Trump completely turns this election around- which isn’t impossible, unfortunately
How bout "if you have trouble figuring out if you're for me or Trump. You ain't black." - Joe Biden. That one's pretty good how about “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” - Joe Biden
A pretty safe district I'm watching- Oregon 4th District. Clinton won this district by 0.1%, but I believe Biden is in little danger of losing it to Trump. DeFazio is a longtime incumbent, but has only been challenged by the same perennial candidate for several elections(1/2)
Just wait until the oppo researchers get into Joe Biden's freezer. He's probably been hoarding rare Ben and Jerry's flavors.
America needs Joe Biden’s compassion and experience. He is uniquely capable to put our country back together.He knows how it should work, could work better, and who he needs to help him get it done.
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I wish all 11,460 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden built white guilt and resentment.
Fucking gross. Sorry but no other words describe this
A Trumper took a screenshot of my profile picture and typed the words no need to fear Biden's bitches are here and i take it as a compliment lol I am a loyal Biden supporter and proud of it raise your hand if you are a loyal Biden supporter.#Biden2020
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Waiting for my Biden yard sign has not arrived yet.
Plus it'll be a good year for Dems. It's the kind of situation where if Lipinski had been primaried in a Biden midterm, and the R's had a candidate with money, it would be Likely D. It's a suburban district, but more WWC than suburban districts like IL-6 and IL-14.
Reasonable. I’d say OK-5 is probably Tilt R, if you say Rs have the advantage.  Republican runoff is a liability, both candidates aren’t doing so great with funds, and Biden may even win the district this time.
Source? I hope Biden announces her as VP next week endorsed Harris for VP not long after Super Tuesday and not long after Bernie dropped out
Tell President Trump that he needs to have one of his debates with Joe Biden moderated by blacks.
If Trump were the mayor of Chicago crime would be under control. Let that sink in because Biden is less competent that Lightfoot.
Same if he does that Biden is winning Arizona New Mexico and Nevada since they similar voting groups
Agreed I will not take a vaccine from our country til Biden becomes president he will be the one releasing the vaccine to the public
Trumpers can laugh at my reply of saying Biden has the lead in Florida all they want but if Biden wins the state we will be the ones who said told you so and we will have the last laugh and the last word and I can't wait it will be satisfying
Also the economist is giving Biden an 85% chance of winning Florida a state that typically votes to the right of the popular vote and undecided voters typically end up going to the GOP
Another day, another example of how Trump is the one who is insane, and Biden just has a lifelong stuttering problem which can be edited to own the libs
Not happening since you are already making Democrats, that we’re neutral or civil, leave because of the Communist angle you are endorsing. Hell you’re using Biden.
How can Biden be for science when he can’t form a sentence or think Black Trump supporters aren’t black for some reason? As far as I know voting against Democrats doesn’t scientifically mean you go against your skin color.
Even Newsweek can't avoid admitting that Biden is obviously full of shit. "Overtures to appear receptive to their needs"
You mean a CDC that admitted to lying about the cases recently? Biden? How much did he and the nurses caress you to vote for him?
2016 polls vs current polls hear that Trumpers Biden has a stronger lead than Hillary did he outperforming her margins he is not as well hated. The attacks against Biden don't land and they were not that far off if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins period math is math.
Trumpers questioned the polls in Florida which Biden is leading by 6% do they realize the polls were near spot on on election day 4 years ago Trump was leading by 0.4% when he won by 1.2%. Assuming they make same mistake they made 4 years ago Biden wins Florida period.
Oh such a sweetie..poor little guy wants to go to school. You will get us back to normal with God's grace president Biden..
Thank you Amy if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins the state all he needs is one more swing state and he is president and there is nothing maga can do about it math is math
I think Biden is likely to improve on Clinton in most of the ancestral Dem Appalachian counties. Hillary Clinton was basically the worst possible candidate for those areas. I think Biden will lose WV by more like 30% than 42%.
You forgot no country.  Biden is working with Sanders &amp; AOC right now to open the borders to Soetoro’s OFA and Soros’ OSI, make this a sanctuary country for anyone who wants to come, allow everyone to vote (no ID  req’d), turn all private property to the State for communal use.
I mean, it's possible if Biden continues to dominate, though I'm doubtful about MO and IN, even in a huge landslide I think SC would go blue before them.
Biden is an infinitely better candidate than Trump. American icon? He’s a damn con man. But I guess if you’re one of the ones who has been conned, you’ll go to great lengths to justify supporting him.
It really did seem like Dems were in Disarray at that point.  Luckily Delaware is beyond Safe with Biden as the nominee.
100 days til election day everyone and 100 days starts an important journey for Biden it will test if Biden's lead is really as strong as polls suggest or will the election be closer than we thought.
Even if polls in Florida are off by same margin they were in 2016 Biden still wins Florida and if Texas is off too Biden wins
Trump's playbook in connecting Biden to the far left like Bernie Sanders isn't working at all according to the guests in the reidout show they hoped to use this playbook if Bernie Sanders was the nominee but that didn't work so nominating Biden foiled his plans and I am relieved
Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping now at 71% down from 72% a 1% may not seem like a big deal but the fact that Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping is a very good sign for Biden if he wins Texas Biden becomes the next president no matter what happens
The economist unlike fivethirtyeight has a predicted range of electoral college votes and Trumpers think that Trump will win by a landslide that is simply not going to happen Trump's EC range is 123-279 Biden's range is 259-415 Trump is loosing support period.
Under Biden, taxes will rise on individuals and corporations, causing a rise in unemployment, stock market will crash as companies make less, crime will increase with less police, social medicine will result in rationing, ISIS and terrorism will be reborn, and the list goes on
Sssssh. Biden will call you a racist:
Biden will bring this to your neighborhood:
Biden's polling is much better than Hillary Clinton's. He has a more consistent and larger lead in swing states. Trump's campaign is effectively over.
Not a good poll at all for Goroff…. behind by 7% and underperforming Biden by 7% in her own internal.....
Biden. Not a landslide, but a convincing victory.
These numbers are terrible for Trump. The only way he wins is if him and Biden are equally as unpopular in swing states, and that clearly isn't the case.
Very interesting map. Biden is ahead in my zip code (60126) by 335-194; it went for Clinton by about 15% in 2016.
And also yeah, fuck Obama and Biden. Both are racist. This just isn't a conversation about them. I don't know why you keep bringing them upStates are scrambling to stop a slow-motion 2020 election disaster  via
The Freedom Pub - Biden’s False Climate Promises -
We need to save the post office, for this election and for other reasons. However, if I have to stand in a long line, at the polls, for hours, I’ll do that. Nothing will stop me from voting for Joe Biden on November 3rd. NOTHING WILL STOP ME FROM VOTING.
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
Joe Biden knew all along. We have under 100 days left to ensure he wins and restores the soul of America. What will you do today to help?
If my aunt had balls she would be my uncle.  This is the dumbest topic of liberals.  Give it a rest.  Just go back to supporting joe Biden with your pro liberal agenda.
It’s nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.

Thank God for you Representative Jones. Please keep getting word out to people. Amazing to me that anyone would even consider voting for Biden! He is totally unfit to be the leader of our country
I've spent my life helping others who don't have a voice. Proudly. Now more than ever we need to scream for equality. For fairness. Get to the polls in November. Vote out hate. Vote for Biden. Help people like me. Because you really might be next. Hugs.
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
Remember that a voter who goes to the polls for  in IA NC and GA will be voting for four Sen candidates. Just signed up to phone bank in IA, not because Biden needs to win the state but to help  and  win.
How Caregiving Became More Than Just a Women’s Issue
My point is if Biden has any brains he will put country before internal party power and he will make a unity VP pick. We don’t have the luxury to be fussy. That’s my point. Biden must be a leader and unite the party! So that we can vote blue no matter what!
How the coronavirus got Joe Biden to think much bigger  via
Biden has history w/Susan Rice &amp; she’s got the full compliment of foreign experience we need 2 repair relationships w/our allies. She knows how admins work + she’s brilliant, no-nonsense, strong character, etc. We need experience 2 pull us out of this mess.
The headline here is clickbait. Her stance here is not anti-Biden and she is also gracious to Nancy Pelosi.
That’s on Biden not voters. It’s Biden’s job to unite the party. Plenty of progressives or social democrats he can pick like warren or Barbra lee.
That’s on Biden to unite the party.
She and Harris would be a disaster. I won’t vote for Biden unless he unites the party with a progressive pick as his VP.
Father- what do I tell my fellow Catholics who will not vote for Biden because he is pro choice?
Joe Biden does
The headline is click-bait (it worked, I read the article). She cane off as neither anti-Biden or anti-Pelosi?
Telling people who to vote for is kind of contradicting our right to vote for whoever we want, yeah? There’s many reasons that you shouldn’t vote for Biden or Trump as well so you may as well vote for whoever you have the most confidence in.
JACKASS!He did all kinds of crooked stuff that you would never acknowledge!Including setting up his legally elected Presidential replacement!Three years!Russia?Lawless is how I would describe Obama and many in his camp!While w/Biden you won’t dignify an answer to any questions!!
So he apologized. No one mentions Biden’s MANY problems w/ the truth,holding up a BILLION to Ukraine to fire a prosecutor.And the history of LYING about his schooling along with his lack of accomplishments!This man has been on the wrong side of history his whole damn career!#LIAR
Facts:Biden 50 years in government with 90’sCrime Bill hurt Black People and Family’s all over this country. Against the second black justice in history! The rest of his career is a black hole! Trump? 3 years in government. Most successful President in history! You are the TROLL!
You gotta be kidding! My Five year old could run circles around Biden . He’s a loser, abuser, blackmailer and has been Proven the Biggest LIAR in the history of the senate! Not 3 degrees, not top of class, but near bottom! In short, a corrupt EX-Senator who should stay that way!

Joe BIDEN IS BELIEVED TO BE A PRACTICING Catholic in spite of his total support for abortion rights by 46%. Is that weird or what?
People just looking and itching for a reason for confrontation. It’s an act of those that feel like they are losing control. Let that be so in November! Biden 2020!
Thank you for saying exactly how I feel about the current polls. They gave us such a false sense of security in 2016 that I feel I can’t let my guard down now. Biden 2020! (Please!)
I am scared of a civil war. My kids are 19 and 15. But let’s be honest. The ones making all the noise is minute. People will vote Biden because they don’t like trump. Not because they support Biden. Trump will win if these daily protests continue

The next president will be either Donald trump or Joe Biden. No one else. This independent vote is a waste. The independent won’t win. Just be aware, a vote for an independent means you are ok with another four years of trump.
If they don’t vote for Joe Biden, that means they are ok with Trump for another four years. So, yes, I think they are wasting their votes.
I agree with that, portnoy probably should have told him. But I believe his personal politics and animosity towards Potus is what’s driving this. If portnoy interviewed a high level lib(like Biden) without telling him, something tells me he wouldn’t be so triggered.
Analysis | In nearly every swing state at this point, Biden is outperforming Obama and Clinton
The difference is the width of one of Biden's leg hairs.

Y'know, Biden served as VP for 8 years and they were some of the best years America has ever had.  The tweet just doesn't make any logical sense. Biden is a known commodity, bunker boy!  If he wanted to "destroy your neighborhood", wouldn't he have done it by now???
Your playbook for ads is to rebrand pictures of Portland and say this is America under Joe Biden. You think people don't know where those pictures are from. We are not blind.

You really are ignorant! You are there because  couldn't run for a 3rd term and Joe Biden chose not to challenge Hillary Clinton!
Because Biden is going to win. We don't want to primary our own parties sitting president. I totally agree with your assessment of her though. She is amazing and relentless. After watching her speech today, I believe she will be the countries 1st female President, but in 2028
Even Jason admitted on TV that he understood Joe Biden was merely pointing out that other Presidents at the very least did not openly display hostility towards POC like Trump does.Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.

I'm arguing that defeating trump should come first and people shouldn't support trump, just because Biden doesn't rise to their extreme progressive agenda
What funeral? The divisive Obama Biden political rally?!
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
I thought there was 1 Trump channel and 2 Biden channels on cable.
Joe Biden knew all along. We have under 100 days left to ensure he wins and restores the soul of America. What will you do today to help?
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
Same here, I hope her early confrontation with Biden isn't held against her, all the other candidates eventually piled on in their attacks against Biden, didn't they?
If my aunt had balls she would be my uncle.  This is the dumbest topic of liberals.  Give it a rest.  Just go back to supporting joe Biden with your pro liberal agenda.
It’s nice to see that you are settling on Biden. A completely incompetent candidate. Scary actually. Not only do u support killing unborn children, you also want to see the demise of the US under failed democratic policies. Must be nice to watch from the sidelines in Spain.
Just saw a commercial for  where that #idiot  was making fun of Trump for stumbling over his words... just wondering if you've ever heard Biden talk? #Trump2020
Joe Biden is going to be the President of the nursing home... no doubt.
Yes. If we had competency at the federal level we wouldn’t be banned from traveling to the majority of the world. 150,000 people are dead. Mitch and CO and giving money to companies and military while people are being evicted and dying. So yes. Biden will 100% be better.
And the CBC love them some Joe Biden. He was always my first choice.

Thank God for you Representative Jones. Please keep getting word out to people. Amazing to me that anyone would even consider voting for Biden! He is totally unfit to be the leader of our country
What has Obama and Biden done for blacks in their 8 years, tell me?
I think you want to blame the real cause, China, for all these desths, not Trump. If Biden was President the desths would be 1,000 times higher!
I'll still vote for progressive candidates in Dem primaries and I'll likely begrudgingly vote for Biden but honestly it's so damn frustrating.
I am showing Biden’s tweet to my friends of color that are doctors (2 of them ) , nurse , and a chiropractor. They will laugh in his face for this degrading tweet .
I've spent my life helping others who don't have a voice. Proudly. Now more than ever we need to scream for equality. For fairness. Get to the polls in November. Vote out hate. Vote for Biden. Help people like me. Because you really might be next. Hugs.
AG Barr is just slowly exposing the most corrupted administration in the history of the USA.  The Obama Biden administration! No wonder that the Democrats hate him.  But nobody is above the law! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Democrats Hypocrites!
Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.
Biden will win the rust belt for sure.  Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina will be very, very close, but out of those three, AZ will most likely go to Biden.  Georgia will be one of the worst BG states for suppression and I think Trump will win GA solidly
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
Trump: I want to gas peaceful protesters  Biden: No, 𝑰 want to gas peaceful protesters
There isn't anyone from a swing state who could provide what he needed. I'm almost positive this won't be an all white ticket. So no Warren. I'd love susan rice but she has baggage. And I promise you Biden knows who got him thru the primaries so it will probably be a black woman.
My point is if Biden has any brains he will put country before internal party power and he will make a unity VP pick. We don’t have the luxury to be fussy. That’s my point. Biden must be a leader and unite the party! So that we can vote blue no matter what!

Biden has history w/Susan Rice &amp; she’s got the full compliment of foreign experience we need 2 repair relationships w/our allies. She knows how admins work + she’s brilliant, no-nonsense, strong character, etc. We need experience 2 pull us out of this mess.
You've lost your mind supporting Biden who doesn't know what's up or down and what's right or left. You are a pathetic performer who has had her best days decades ago. American's feel sorry for you! Get a backbone and stand for truth! Biden is false &amp; lies!
Biden had a Stroke
That’s on Biden not voters. It’s Biden’s job to unite the party. Plenty of progressives or social democrats he can pick like warren or Barbra lee.
That’s on Biden to unite the party.
She and Harris would be a disaster. I won’t vote for Biden unless he unites the party with a progressive pick as his VP.
The choice is stark. The most prolific liar, the most corrupt and inept POTUS In History or a very competent, honest and caring politician in Biden.
And all 19 believe Biden vs none who believe anything Trump says.
Father- what do I tell my fellow Catholics who will not vote for Biden because he is pro choice?
Biden had a Stroke recently!
JACKASS!He did all kinds of crooked stuff that you would never acknowledge!Including setting up his legally elected Presidential replacement!Three years!Russia?Lawless is how I would describe Obama and many in his camp!While w/Biden you won’t dignify an answer to any questions!!
So he apologized. No one mentions Biden’s MANY problems w/ the truth,holding up a BILLION to Ukraine to fire a prosecutor.And the history of LYING about his schooling along with his lack of accomplishments!This man has been on the wrong side of history his whole damn career!#LIAR
Facts:Biden 50 years in government with 90’sCrime Bill hurt Black People and Family’s all over this country. Against the second black justice in history! The rest of his career is a black hole! Trump? 3 years in government. Most successful President in history! You are the TROLL!
You gotta be kidding! My Five year old could run circles around Biden . He’s a loser, abuser, blackmailer and has been Proven the Biggest LIAR in the history of the senate! Not 3 degrees, not top of class, but near bottom! In short, a corrupt EX-Senator who should stay that way!
I would LOVE  as VP on BIDEN’s ticket. His corporate donors would never allow it.

And they are coming for the suburbs.  Law introduced by Obama &amp; Biden, but POTUS refused to enforce.  Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, or AFFH.  Using this law as and add-on to HUD, O'Bidens plan to invade suburbs. Take over local Government of towns, cities and burrows.
refuse to account, will be denied state &amp; Fed assistance, like education and roads.  Feds will force communities to build multi dwelling, low income buildings, at your expense.  They will outlaw single family homes as White privilege.  This is Socialism!  This is Biden's plan.

Rice might make a better match with Biden in office, the winning is going to be difficult. W/ all the republican tricks, trump could lose the popular vote by 30 points and still win the election. Thus the best campaign should be almost the entire consideration
Over a thousand a day of us are dying from Trumps complete mismanagement of the Trump Corona Virus. Biden would be a tremendous improvement.
And Trump begged foreign leaders to manufacture dirt on Biden. Trump was impeached for it.
Who are you voting for? Biden hasn’t said who his successor errr Vice President will be.
Joe BIDEN IS BELIEVED TO BE A PRACTICING Catholic in spite of his total support for abortion rights by 46%. Is that weird or what?

Agreed.  Joe Biden is a poor unfortunate soul.  Well said!
What a nonsense!  It's very good that Joe Biden won't be the President and the puppet of the left mob in the White House! Hard to get a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is even much worse than her.
Wrong! Trump is right! I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
I agree with that, portnoy probably should have told him. But I believe his personal politics and animosity towards Potus is what’s driving this. If portnoy interviewed a high level lib(like Biden) without telling him, something tells me he wouldn’t be so triggered.
In NH, the key will be if Sununu gets through and wins a 3rd term as Governor as Biden blows Trump out for President.  If he does, he holds all the cards. He could decide to take a shot at the White House lesving the door open for Ayotte-Hassan II.....
Hello. Thanks for the tweet. Here's the rationale. If Biden blows Trump out by 10+, it would mark the biggest landslide by a Dem in a Pres. Election since LBJ over Goldwater in '64 (60-39). 2 yrs. later Republicans had a huge year....
Another tweet to promote Trump by Maggie! Disgraceful! I never send Biden or Obama on her account! I could be wrong !

The difference is the width of one of Biden's leg hairs.

Who cares. Regular citizen when he said that. Biden was in politics. Besides, what groupie doesnt want a billionaire to grab them by the pussy. I’ll wait!!!!!
Y'know, Biden served as VP for 8 years and they were some of the best years America has ever had.  The tweet just doesn't make any logical sense. Biden is a known commodity, bunker boy!  If he wanted to "destroy your neighborhood", wouldn't he have done it by now???
Same! Plenty of cool white suburban women do NOT fall for bullshit -- you can believe it! Joe Biden, here we come!

This will happen in America, if we don't stop Democrats from buying the power of the Presidency.  Joe Biden promises free HC, maintenance man, nurse &amp; therapist for seniors?  Free childcare, free college, free housing?  Gov has no money, it does not take from taxpayers, or PRINT!

The fact that Team Biden has been unabashedly citing “that girl was me” as a serious reason why they don’t want Kamala should tell you a lot about the petty clowns running the show.
It originates with this  article. So many of these outlandish claims could be dealt with early on if we had a norm of discourse, that we expected extreme claims to subject themselves to the public dialogue of experts before either side spread them.

Biden says Trump was the first racist president. One bullet in the foot. Now he appoints Chris Dodd to the VP selection committee. Another bullet in the foot.  Please, please, don't follow the traditional Democratic path of blowing a sure thing!
Hmm, not a Trump support one bit or Biden. Doesn't matter who wins this election. We're fucked either way.
And will actually get worse if Biden is elected.  Will embolden them more as they'll see it as an endorsement.
Once again ...Joe Biden is not the President. All of this is happening under and because of Trump!
Hide till 2021 and let Biden run this Country
That says it all.  The man is in the twilight of his life.  His IQ and cognitive capacity are in the decline.  He cannot think on his feet.  A Biden presidency would be a disaster
Donnie, more lies from the pathogical Liar-in-Chief. YOU are a large part of the lamestream media.   Biden will win in a landslide.  PS, you really should read Mary Trump's book.  If only you could read a book!  (Worst, laziest president in American history.)
My energy is through the roof for Biden, but I will not trust that all will be well until Biden wins in a landslide and Trump is gone!
The polls are showing 72% in favor of Biden. Can't wait for that Silent Majority (72%) to vote.
It certainly appears that EVERY tweet of yours is a lie, Donnie. Why is that?  YOU vote by mail-in! Everyone knows YOU are a pathological liar. Biden's gonna crush you in November. I'll do my part. Then the SDNY will do their part. Be afraid, Donnie.
False. Biden is crushing Trump. All Biden has to do is let Trump whine to Fox "News," Hannity and tweet. In reality, Trump is crushing himself. From COVID-19 to the economy to race relations, Trump has taken a giant dump on America. Biden will win in a landslide.
Dude, legit, I thank you for your service but stop calling yourself a conservative. No self respecting conservative would vote for the shit show that Biden supports.
Mr AK probably thought that firing warning shots (ala Uncle Joe “Get a Shotgun” Biden) was a good thing to do.
Yes .. Trump is President only Nov 2. 2020z Nov 3  is for President Biden.😂😂😂
How bout "if you have trouble figuring out if you're for me or Trump. You ain't black." - Joe Biden. That one's pretty good how about “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” - Joe Biden
America needs Joe Biden’s compassion and experience. He is uniquely capable to put our country back together.He knows how it should work, could work better, and who he needs to help him get it done.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden built white guilt and resentment.
Fucking gross. Sorry but no other words describe this
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Tell President Trump that he needs to have one of his debates with Joe Biden moderated by blacks.
Even Newsweek can't avoid admitting that Biden is obviously full of shit. "Overtures to appear receptive to their needs"
5 or 6 months late, Homie. There are now almost 150,000 Americans dead from the Trump Virus. You failed. Trump failed. Republicans failed. The American people won't fail in November. Biden in a landslide!
You forgot no country.  Biden is working with Sanders &amp; AOC right now to open the borders to Soetoro’s OFA and Soros’ OSI, make this a sanctuary country for anyone who wants to come, allow everyone to vote (no ID  req’d), turn all private property to the State for communal use.
145,000 dead Americans won't be voting for Donnie. Many of the 11% unemployed won't either. Neither will many women or people of color. Certainly very few Dems and independents will vote for the worst president ever. Can you say *landslide for Biden*?
Nope. We're certainly not going to (re)elect the  absolute worst president in the history of the United States. We will elect Joe Biden in a landslide. Bless your heart, Junior. Time is running out, indeed. Buh bye.
Biden is an infinitely better candidate than Trump. American icon? He’s a damn con man. But I guess if you’re one of the ones who has been conned, you’ll go to great lengths to justify supporting him.
Is that from the same Kayleigh Polling Company that told you we have the best mortality rate and that Biden wants to defund police?
Whoever did that to those officers should absolutely be arrested and charged. That being said, I'm looking forward to a Biden landslide in November.
It’s be a shame if, somehow, in the middle of some night it was all cleared away and replaced by Biden 2020 signs.
Under Biden, taxes will rise on individuals and corporations, causing a rise in unemployment, stock market will crash as companies make less, crime will increase with less police, social medicine will result in rationing, ISIS and terrorism will be reborn, and the list goes on
Because you and Trump don't give a damn about American lives!  We have 3 1/2 years of evidence. The nation, and in fact the world, is looking forward to Joe Biden's landslide victory on November 3rd.
And also yeah, fuck Obama and Biden. Both are racist. This just isn't a conversation about them. I don't know why you keep bringing them up
Biden will ban single family housing zones.  Making all suburbs just like their Democrat run cities.
Top Democrat Tells Holocaust Survivors To Check Their Privilege  This the party of Joe Biden. You don’t matter unless they say so
Also *** future President Biden will make it right with
Notice how little presence Biden needs on the campaign trail. The more trump blunders about, the more minds are made up. I would be surprised if there are even Presidential debates this year. People want to vote and wrap this up.
As we all know basement Biden has big mental issues!
We now have declassified proof the coup against Trump began during the Obama/Biden presidency.  Matt Gaetz speaks out after feud with Liz Cheney  via
Wish Joe Biden would just stop saying things.
How about these 5 words...Obama and Biden are living:  Rent. Free. Between. Your. Ears.
We won’t let them. I head a very different number today. Trump was ahead of Biden. In battleground states &amp; closing in on the national
Joe Biden is a dork
Biden should shut up and leave the mic to Trump. Dotard Donnie is Biden's best campaigner.
When President Biden takes over in January.
You didn’t run against Biden numbnuts you ran against Hillary.
biden need that endorsement to get the black vote lol
The GOP has made a sport out of mocking Biden’s misspeaks despite him having a known speech impediment. Classy, yet typical. Meanwhile, Trump brags about “acing” a dementia test, but even worse fails to grasp why he SHOULDN’T be bragging.
Strong ? The only strength is in numbers is Republicans voting for Biden and the numbers on the virus moron #TrumpMeltdown
The Presidential debate moderators has come up with their first question for Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden, What color is the White House?🤪
Thank you!  for summing this up so brilliantly!  These Democrat Leaders are unfair, hypocritical, corrupt.                   🇺🇸☑️ Vote 🇺🇸☑️ Them 🇺🇸☑️ Out  Bad For Pelosi And Biden! See What Jim Jordan Just Revealed About Democrats  via
Not trying to dissuade you, I hoped for Bernie and I'm voting Biden too. We just need better in the future.
I really really really really, and I can’t state this enough, really can’t wait for to cast my all Democratic ballot with Joe Biden at the top.
It’s even more dramatic on boats.   I mean zero Biden flags Trump flags everywhereYOUR DOING THE SAME THING WITH BIDEN SSKSSKSHSHSKS
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
I’ve typed this many times to many ppl in the thread. This type of overconfidence in an election win is dangerous. Especially with a candidate like Joe Biden as your Best In Show. Hillary was expected and projected to beat trump in 2016 and it didn’t happen. We’ll see tho.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Allies say Karen Bass's reputation as a bridge-builder would make her a strong partner to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Mainstream media can’t promote Bill or Hillary endorsing Biden for President if they bring it up. Especially with Creepy Uncle Joes history.
trump is our national embarrassment. VOTE JOE BIDEN!!!!
So, we’re all going to go vote in November right? I know I am, and I’m really trying not to have an impeached Trump get a second term but I also genuinely despise Joe Biden. 🙃 I’ve done my research on  and  I definitely endorse him, I cannot endorse the other two.
I am an Iowan for Biden but good luck!
Voting for Biden in one election doesn’t absolve you of all the really shitty decisions that have made this country weaker in so many ways. You have used the #LGBTQ community as a bogeyman. You have used #Black folks as a bogeyman. Your party is divisive and mendacious.
Ah see now I’m more knowledgeable on electoral landslides thank you. Regardless i stand by my words in saying it’s going to happen. And the cockiness I’m seeing from the left is a very dangerous mindset. No election is a guaranteed victory. Especially with a candidate like Biden.
To be fair I feel like people are even less confident about the democratic nominee in 2020 than they were in 2016 so yes you’re right it’s not 2016. It’s an even worse situation where most people don’t even want Biden. That’s a strange situation to be so confident in a trump loss
Because Biden didn’t run.
I reckon Joe Biden would be harder, dude would probably forget why he even stopped by within a minute.
Joe Biden? More like McDoesn't know where the fuck he is half the time.
Will Joe Biden be Kamala Harris’s new sugar daddy?  VP Nod?
OMG! You're a HillBot. I am so glad she lost a Trump. Kamala is a Hillary clone and I HATE her for that.   I'll be grudgingly vote for Biden as long as he doesn't pick Harris as VP.
Yes! I was going to go along with the Biden thing because I want to get rid of Trump. But if he picks Kamala Harris, I'm writing Bernie Sander's name in. F that crap, I'm not voting for that bi%ch.
The proverity level where we live.  You have done many hurtful things to me personally. I have taken it personal. I don’t love Biden but the hate you have showed to me gives me more motivation than I have ever had to vote. I went from being a strong Republican to now
My doctor told me this morning that I am diabetic. Not only that, but she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy for glucose testing and such. $100, I can’t afford it. My Medicare advantage doesn’t cover them. I only hope I live long enough to see Biden elected.
That is ridiculous. There are plenty other women of color who aren't willing to Flip-flop on policies or walk over the top with someone just to be VP or president. Joe Biden needs a Tim Kaine kind of VP.
She is too ambitious. She will overshadow Biden. She's the type that would have no problem declaring him incompetent and she the next President. She's a Hillary clone and should never be trusted or be the vice president let alone president. #NeverKamala
We’ve been on the scary path the last 4 years... Biden’s already been in the White House, thus we already know how he will act.
I am going to have a hard time voting for Joe Biden as it is. With Kamala as VP, I may not be able to bring myself low enough to vote for Biden with Hillary's clone on the ticket.
I joked that the DNC was going to "Weekend At Bernie's" Biden to the White House, but they are really committing to the bit now
Trump &amp; GOP are getting desperate. They know he's going to lose in a landslide to a weak candidate so they're using socialism as a scare tactic.   Joe Biden is NOT a Trojan Horse for Progressives, AOC &amp; Bernie. 🤣🤣 He's actually an old style Repub. That's what is scaring them.
Biden is a well balanced, caring man who shows America needs him. Joe doesn’t need groupies, we get when we have Joe, truth &amp; visionAccording to the polls America loves Joe. We need calm but mostly someone we can trust, that Joe. With trump, it’s been 3-1/2 years ofchaos &amp; fear.
That is hilarious. Now Biden’s dementia is right wing propaganda. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait...I thought this was Biden’s America?? November 3rd...vote!!!!!!
Then if it's not race related why is Biden ONLY considering a female person of color for his VP pick? Unfortunately, every thing is about race these days regardless of whether you like it or not.
Yeah vote for biden cause you are screwing us.
biden forgot how to spell joe this morning.
Also Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee... idk that seems like a compromise with the “middle” to me
Why couldn't we have had Booker instead of Biden?? 🤬🤬🤬
Biden LITERALLY told a room full of donors that, "Nothing will fundamentally change." His words.
Agree! Vote Biden 2020!
I wonder how many Republicans will be a part of the Biden administration? Bet there will be more fascists than progressives.
Too bad that they made the decision of Biden being the nominee before a single vote was cast. Fixing elections is fine when Democrats do it. Right?
Kamala Harris is an egomaniac. Biden will never take someone who will outshine. She insulted him he will never forgive her. We need to end all her hopes of ever becoming vice president or president She's a horrible Hillary Clinton wanna be. 🤮🤮🤮🤮
No one's falling for your distraction from the real news Biden is considering Karen Bass as VP. Anything you say or do is small beans compared to that.
Here lies Joe Biden:
Bring back decency. Rest in Power John Lewis. Trump refused to go honor his life. #JohnLewis #JoeBiden   “Joe and Jill Biden pay their respects to late civil rights icon John Lewis, who is lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
As President,  will fight for equal pay, combat discrimination and harassment in the workplace, invest in women-owned small businesses, expand access to health care and so much more. With the Biden Agenda for Women, we can build a tomorrow that is better for all of us.
Iam definitely voting for Joe Biden, there is no.way I would ever vote for Trump. In my opinion he represents  everything a leader of this country should not be. It may take awhile to correct the damage he has done but we can do it.  #ResistanceTaskForce

That’s nice of her to do that for Joe Biden
If he doesn’t go they’ll criticize him for not paying his respects  If he does go they’ll criticize him for not practicing social distancing. Damned if ya do damned if ya don’t. Whatever Biden decides to do will be considered “Presidential” though.
Have you read anything about Joe Biden?
Harris basically called Biden a racist in the debates. Joe like Hillary wants someone who will never threaten their position as POTUS. Kamala is not a yes girl or one to play 2nd fiddle. She's too ambititous and that's threatening to Biden. Even Hillary picked a yes man as VP.
FU K-Hive. Kamala Harris is too ambitious and will not be content to be 2nd in charge. Joe Biden has an ego like Hillary's and once you do him wrong, he never forgives.   Harris will NEVER be VP or president. Rep. Karen Bass  will be Biden's VP.
Fact Check: Trump's False, Recurring Claim About Biden's Stance on Police  ( And NBC's KWQC in Davenport, Iowa keeps playing it 🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑🤣🤑 )

Biden lineup: Cher, Taylor Swift, Madonna...
This is the funniest tweet I've ever seen. What kind of an idiot thinks Joe Biden is a leftist? Joe Biden is extremely conservative Democrat he borders on being a Republican🤮🤮🤮  There was absolutely nothing about Joe Biden did is remotely left or Progressive.
Do people really fall for this bullshit you’re peddling about Biden? #GOPBetrayedAmerica #Resist
If 2020 first give us Biden as President, I will be moving.
this #liar will block anybody who exposes him. He willingly and openly does business with the corrupt and shady #Alibaba he told me he doesn't care. As long as he gets his money he doesn't care what they do. He is as #corrupt as #Biden I will continue to exposehim
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.  Wake up, MAGA! He hates YOU as much as he hates us...you just aren’t listening.🤷🏻‍♀️ #BlackLivesMatter  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  🍊🤡🤬🌊💙🌊💙☮️❄️
Yankees should have Biden throw out the first pitch on August 15th now.
do you get enough personal pleasure from snarky comments about Biden, Obama, Hillary and Dems to keep you happy through 4 more years of DT’s regime? Your Junior High mean girl act is getting old.
so he blocks me after I exposed him for the fraud that he is. He is like Biden Jr, all he cares about is money.which is why he doesn't care about doing business with shady Alibaba, which commits intellectual property theft. And he knows they do. #MAGA #dirty #liar
Uhhh, hey ‘genius’....Biden isn’t the President so who IS the President to blame here?
this is the guy who suggested I do business with shady #alibaba ,aka China, who steal a intellectual property and resell it. He said he didn't care about morality, just about making money. Don't believe a word this dirty bird says. He is just like Biden.
If Joe Biden endorsed,  Medicare For All  Green New Deal  Work Place Democracy  Banning Private Prison  Marijuana Legalization   ... I might endorse him.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Quick, where do I vote for Biden?
Why should I support a candidate that doesn’t support Medicare for All or The Green New Deal? Other than not Trump, Biden is basically a Republican.
I hope they slip a dementia test into the Biden/Trump debates. Just have ‘em both randomly trying to remember five words.
Is Biden secretly paying you? Because you keep sharing things that are a HUGE positive thing for the country if Biden is elected. I mean, I was already voting for him, but this is just another cherry on top. Keep highlighting his good policies. It helps sink Trump!
Can't wait for November 2020 when Biden wins the presidency and suddenly every single conservative media outlet starts becoming way more worried about coronavirus so they can blame him for not doing anything about it when he takes office in January.
So was Trump at least Biden isn’t too fragile to deal with it like an adult.
Yep. When Biden wins itll all go back to normal. I'm glad. Trump is putting to much sunlight on our problems. It must stop.
The trump ad attacking Biden is nausea inducing. He's saying Biden is for defunding the police and it's a scare tactic. It looks like a bad cut-and-paste job. Joe Biden says, "Yes, absolutely." Yes absolutely to what? Maybe someone asked him if he wanted fries with that.
I cant wait to vote for JOE BIDEN  I cant wait to vote for THERESA GREENFIELD
Mitt Romney is fear-mongering ultra religious conservative who wants to destroy Social Security &amp; Medicare. Trump is loosing and even he knows that.   Joe Biden is a conservative do nothing war-mongering noelib, but at least he's not a sociopath who's a wanna-be dictator.
Seeing Joe Biden's corpse being swallowed by the Leftist Mob should scare the shit out of every single moderate voter   But it doesn't which adds to the November fear   There probably will be a divide in the country post election
The reams of proposals reflect Biden’s belief that the nation faces immense challenges that require a far-reaching government response not seen since the New Deal.
Yes of course he is which makes him the lesser of two evils. My daughter is transgender I will not vote for anyone other than Biden in order to save my daughter from being murdered by Republicans.
Vote for Biden. He won't kill you unlike the previous tenant.
Correct...But I have to vote for Biden in order to destroy Trump Who will destroy my Trans daughter.
Biden is taking a nap and Snake Sabo can't stand you. Go back to Canada and stay there..
So is Biden going to pick a VP anytime soon or has he and he already forgot who it is?
JFC. It was...checking notes...Biden who championed the crime bill in 93 that put LARGE number of african americans in jail. Not Trump, not republicans. Floyd and Castile were actions of singular people. Not a group as a whole. Stop generalizing, it's dangerous and stupid.
Wasn't it your boy Biden who championed the crime bill in 93? Wasn't a republican. And what has Trump done specifically that has expressed that african american lives don't matter? Stop with the baseless accusations. Find something else to whine about.
And they are now starting to say this is what Biden’s America will look like, as if he is already in control and not that small handed orange toddler
I have been honest about it I'm voting for Biden. I don't like him I don't like nothing will fundamentally change I will fight him every moment that he's president I will do everything I can to make sure he never gets a second term.  Neoliberalism is evil and Trump is a sociopath
When Biden pats you on the back keep your hand on your wallet.
But, as bad as things are, if Biden wins, Trump is going to fuck things up that much worse so he can say that Biden is terrible. So, that's why we must vote for Trump, so he doesn't have to fuck things up even worse than he already has.Obama didn’t name Biden VP until August 28th
Obama didn’t pick Biden until August 28th. Twitter just made this search toxic. His timeline is normal
*I open my email the morning after Biden is elected*  "Joe Biden: Hi Samuel, I'd Like to Be Added to Your Professional Network."
I didn't even notice he wasn't there, guess that is what a Biden presidency will look like.
They have to pick Susan Rice because she has a simple name. Biden will never be able to say “Kamala” right. It will cause too many gaffes.
Inside HigherEd: Biden Links Loan Forgiveness to Racial Equity
You have been focused. Focused on Russia. Focused on impeachment. Focused on not having the early travel ban from China. Focused on open borders to let Coronavirus come in from the south. Focused on one thing only. Getting rid of my President. Biden’s hair plugs look better.
He'll resign with an objective excuse that will protect his ego and hurt Biden.  Something along the lines of "Both Biden and I too old to be running for president in 2020." It would be the perfect opening for Nikki Haley.
He'll resign by stating that both he and Biden are both too old to be running for president.  With no formal convention at this point, the nomination process will have a lot fewer openings for drama.
aren’t y’all the reason elizabeth warren stayed in and didn’t endorse biden leading the the end of bernies campaign all because you wanted to be bullies?
You know Biden tweets all the time so maybe you can go there and tell him how’s his mental capacity is going
I’m voting #Trump2020 because Biden is just a puppet for the lunatic left.
I hate that people talk like this. If Donald Trump loses John Roberts will swear Joe Biden in on January 20th and then Trump is a private citizen with no power. The idea that he will stay is ridiculous.
neither of them hit 50%. Biden has hit 50% with 5/7 most recent polls.
Maybe (her re-election is safely assumed). She could resign as Speaker, and the House choose someone else -- who need not be a member -- as Speaker, who would then become President Clinton... er, Biden...  At least that's how I understand it.

Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
There are some blue check accounts who are now saying Joe Biden made this comment. Do better media!
Hey Media! The person who you claim is an “ally” to Joe Biden is someone who has probably donated to the Campaign once! You are really stretching on this story because some of you are acting like this guy is apart of his inner circle.
Obama didn’t pick Joe Biden until August 23rd. The reason why it seems like this taking long is because people especially on this app are making the process incredibly toxic. Like very very toxic.
Well I'd hope Biden's running mate focuses on being president, considering the state of his health
another double digit lead for biden from an A pollster, adding it to the collection.
I can’t believe CNBC actually ran that story saying its a Biden ally. Please don’t fall for this crap.
Oh I can not wait for the day you become our next President! My father is still waiting for results of his covid test day 13 at this point results will be useless!  There are so many issues on different levels that need attention but I am confident in you President Biden!
"Too ambitious" is when your Veep is actively trying to poison you.  Other than that, no.  Biden's 77; anyone who accepts that slot has got to be prepared to step up. Senator Harris would suit me just fine.
My guess is Biden will be a one term President (due to age). Keep a close eye on who the VP choice is.
Biden wouldn’t destroy the environment. Biden would restore our allies faith in our country. Biden would restore the economy (as Clinton and Obama did before him) Biden wouldnt allow the Russians to get away with bounties on American soldiers. I didn’t even say the T word.
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"

Biden was stumbling through his 1 hour press conference.
biden has dropped from -160 to -145 in the days since this tweet
Really? Biden to the rescue?
IF AG Barr were practicing partisan law like Eric Holder, Obama's self-described wing man, Hillary, Biden, and Obama would be in prison.
didnt biden’s campaign manager said just last night not to trust politico articles. susan rice is in the top 3 but i’m pretty sure he hasn’t decided.
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Monday he will not be attending memorial services for civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis this week. So, we know what’s wrong with Trump. The question is what’s wrong with us? VOTE for a civil society. Vote Joe Biden. Please.
1. Masks definitely work. 2. Hydroxychloroquine is very questionable. 3. This virus is serious despite what our dictator says. 4. Trump is far more mentally unstable than Biden. 5. Our constitutional right to peacefully protest is being threatened. You are fake news, sir.
President Susan Rice🤔 I like Joe Biden he is the perfect safe bet for 2020 Especially in this case I look at th VP choice as a presidential choice. The WH is a demanding job Age matters How about a black woman intellectual as president?
Something else to consider.
Biden  in mental decline
By the way polling looks, we may have to thank Mark Kelly for Joe Biden possibly winning AZ. Mark Kelly is constantly outpolling Joe and may pull him over the finish line
I think i found the dumbest Tweet today. If you think Joe Biden is more interested im settling scores than winning an election than you’re delusional.
He’s just playing Biden go seek!
All under your watch. We'll take our chances with Biden. A return to decency
The cowards don’t deserve to win anything. Biden in the basement has more visibility than the Republicans in Congress who are in fear of the MSM.
Only the top 1% benefitted from Trumps tax cuts. THAT is a fact.   You saying Biden did nothing while in politics is not a fact. It is OPINION! You’ve provided no facts at all your entire series of posts.
Susan Rice actually makes a lot of sense to be Biden’s VP. She has a ton of foreign policy experience being a former UN Ambassador and National Security Advisor, and Joe Biden has talked about many times wanting to repair global relationships and Rice would be a good fit for that
Don't vote for Joe Biden
Would you like some cheese with your whine?  In every primary except 5, the combo of Sanders/Warren lost to Biden+the rest.  All but 5! Those 5 provided a margin of 145,831 votes.  Just thru 3/10, S/W lost by 2.865m votes.  But you keep believing you won. 1/2
Did I miss something? Biden’s been President for 40 years? I never realized one Senator could fix everything! And if we wanted someone to accomplish nothing we would all vote for Trump strictly on his track record.
Law and order belongs to Trump. Biden owns this.
Organizers expect those efforts will net hundreds more signatures, including from Biden delegates...
If your prediction is true, then it will all go away when Biden becomes president
Biden you ain't black comment rings on forever
Obama likes Susan Rice as Biden running mate as all three worked together  the insider
They gassed and beat American citizens for a photo op. Next time someone says they can't vote for Biden, ask them about this
Shit like this is getting me angry with the VP process. Some people are looking like idiots and are insulting biden voters (which are the backbone of the party)
If Joe Biden doesn’t pick your favorite then that means something came up in the vetting. You’re not sitting in the vetting process and don’t see what they have access to.
Take a good look at this man. He is what Biden becomes if the Democrats win in November.
MSM is the propaganda machine of the left. Practice for becoming Pravda if Biden wins.
Joe Biden , 120 million dead from Coronavirus, no correction  made , no press conferences , no interviews with Chris Wallace hiding in Basement

Trump says Biden will destroy the suburbs, so I guess it’s goodbye to all this. Not! ⁦ The words of a delusional racist soon to be gone.#VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden built white guilt and resentment.
If Trump were the mayor of Chicago crime would be under control. Let that sink in because Biden is less competent that Lightfoot.
And Joe Biden has one?
Yes, really. You’re being lied to. He didn’t cause the deaths, and he didn’t wreck the economy. We who see the truth will not be distracted. We will support our president over Biden the puppet. We will not be bullied by the elites like you or your socialist mobs.
Watching a Dan Jones history video about Edward IV. Hanging out in the background is a mentally unstable Henry VI, who very much reminds me of Joe Biden.  I’m sorry they just killed The Earl of Warwick.
Sssssh. Biden will call you a racist:
this is the third with biden up 15 this week i think.
Biden will bring this to your neighborhood:
It’d be cool if the media and people in general would stop pitting the women Joe Biden is considering for VP against each other.  They all would be fantastic and have their own strengths. I need Joe to choose soon because the way some of y’all are talking is getting ridiculous.
Delusional wishful thinking. The only perv here is Biden.  Get a clue.
This man is not suffering from dementia?  Here’s what Biden said: ” I had nurses at Walter Reed hospital who would bend down and whisper in my ear, go home and get me pillows. They would…actually breathe in my nostrils to make me move, to get me moving.”
Biden has lost it.
I was inconsolable and in tears.  My SO was so over me and asked “C’mon... how bad could it be?”  Now he knows and is voting for Biden.
Biden calling Trump racist without evidence is the same as me calling Biden brain dead without evidence. Wait! I have evidence. Everyday when the handlers let the Alzheimer’s patience out  we see evidence. Like the shuffling gait.
biden need that endorsement to get the black vote lol
I can guarantee not a single person from the Biden came to Shaun King and asked him to stop. No doubt cares about Shaun King because he’s a lying grifting clown.
You've treated our allies like crap. Biden will have a helluva apology tour on his hands to repair all the relationships you have trashed #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

Well then on Nov 4th,welcome President Biden to the  White House! If no one does anything or explains anything Biden will be thumbing his way around the White House in late January 2021!
So what Pastor John and I have learned about the Democrats during the past couple of months~ Is that THEY will rid America of "FRACKING" in Ohio and western Pennsylvania (and many other states) if Biden is elected President?  Get ready people~ NO gasoline vehicles by 2023!!!
Looks like the Democrats have a slight edge on the Prez? This must change before November 3rd? Or we will be saying President Slippery, Slimy, Cheatin' Joe Biden?   Health Care Plan, #PPSV23 for adults/teachers and our military guarding the ballots is the TICKET!!!
So we’re going to forget that Biden has done less in 40 years as a politician than trump in 4? 💀
New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden ...  via
Nope. They just could never get that big of an audience for just Biden without tricking people to attend.What better excuse than a funeral. Leave it to the douchebag Democrats to ride the coattails of a funeral .
Funny how they're allowed to turn a funeral into a stump speech but if trump mentions Biden during any news conference hes lambasted. It's a joke.
Correction: down in Janusry. He will need it up for those 78 days between losing the election and President Biden's inauguration.
Kinda do, cause Joe Biden isn't writing them...
The people voting for Joe Biden are only doing so because of those old Joe Biden memes that were good for like a month and are still riding that high.
no, we can't wait to see u trumpsters cry when he gets demolished by Biden! 🤣🤣🤣
I guess this proves that Biden/Harris is the blue ticket.
Sorry my girl  got it wrong Silver Alert:Joe Biden
I hate that we have to vote for Biden cause there’s nobody better
And that's a rap for this day~ I will be very busy tomorrow, morning and afternoon!!  Then I'm off Saturday and will be heading out to a family dinner..  ta! ta! Later...   Memory isn't as bad as Biden's!
I want Harris to have Barr's job. She'll kick ass in that position and then she will be ready to run for president after Biden retires.
This would be just desserts for Republicans. Dropping out so late in the game would basically let Biden walk in with the Presidency unopposed.  Not in a million years. Trump is going to grift all the way to the end.
Obama and Biden made Putin shit in his pants scared not trump he is owned by putin. Putin has no fear of this coward no matter what he does.
They worked together. They were a team.  always had  back. ALWAYS!!! And for that he deserves our support. He’s Biden is NOT a traitor to our country or an evil vile bigot and Biden listens to the professionals and experts around him.
She’s Dead!!! funeral in January if Biden wins
Nothing against Biden but at this point, vote for a barstool, a blade of grass, a street sign or even an ex-con.....Hey! Barstool, grass, sign, criminal...TV. I’m cognitively there!
Once he is convicted of his crimes he shouldn't be allowed to hold on to the former President title. Oh, Trump, Biden will not pardon you ala Nixon.
I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump’s campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
I’m definitely a suburban Black woman for Biden because Trump has got to exit stage left immediately!
Joe Biden is running to save America from trumps disastrously illegal running of America. Trump sold America to Putin. Biden is taking it back and Putin is not going to like it. We will silence Putin if he forces us to remove his voice from the earth.
I'm good with anyone Biden picks.  They all are strong, smart women.

Look President and Doctor Biden.
I'll be fine with whoever Joe picks. However I want Kamala Harris to be appointed to Barr's job. I think she'll kick ass in that position and then she'll be ready to run for President when Biden completes his mission. Just my thought.
The only statue the right needs to remove is joe Biden
just saw a trump supporter claim trump was a better candidate than biden due to his twitter follower count.   with that logic, katy perry should be our president. funny thing is she’d STILL do a better job than trump.
Illinois!  Biden all the way!
Look at these young American hero's that Putin had murdered and trump did nothing to punish these murders. Coward trump must answer his questions and resign his traitor position. Biden will force Putin to answer questions or pay the ultimate price. Go Joe Go make putin pay.
I love how every Trumper is an expert on Joe Biden’s daily activities and his mental health

Welcome to the world President Biden the entire has been waiting for your arrival.
This is what the media does best. They make everyone believe your choice of President doesn't matter so don't vote. We must mute the stupid voices of media and vote our mind and hearts. Biden will lead America and bring us back to our rightful standing in the world as a leader.
America will proudly elect President Biden to bring America back to it's rightful place as leader of the world.

Supreme Court &gt; VP on the ticket.  Biden promised a Black woman as his next bench pick.  Duckworth is hard to attack and has a compelling story.
The numbers may or may not be accurate; it's July so it doesn't really matter.  VP doesn't matter much either; a VP can hurt a candidate, but it can't get them elected.  And if VP DOES matter so much for Biden then he's lost already.
Here's Joe Biden warmly eulogizing a KKK member. Good times.
This "Biden" tweet something a low information voter will use as "proof" that Orange man is bad...
Biden isn’t the president numb nuts
Exactly!  That's why we need Joe Biden to win!  Vote!
How about Trump as Zeus ordering the "Release the racists!" Trump needs to go now. It will probably take another term under Biden to push them back into obscurity or until Trump opens his Trumptown out of the country(might still be interested in buying Finland.)
Likely not Biden, but SAF not the Orange Menace.
NO, it's UPRIGHT! But NOT like Joe Biden? Whose in his basement until after the ELECTION.. ?
People are as SICK as these people~ "if" they VOTE for Biden in November 2020 (or ANY Democrat!!!)
Right on-Is it the FHAA or something like that “F-em with Housing that’s Affordable” bill that Biden supports? I kno Dan Bongino just did a show on it and I believe POTUS just tweeted about it recently. It will kill Suburbia. Suburbanites gotta wake up -they are not safe w/ Biden
Biden with continually the most generic and awful tweets that mean nothing.
Maybe we should call him the twin brother to Joe Biden? Adam Sniff? That's sounds right~ He's always trying to "sniff" around to see what the Dems can come up with against President Trump    Here, try this dawg Shifty Schiff?
"Biden has been in the government." Yeah no shit Sherlock, and he's a sane &amp; rational human being. I want an establishment candidate after this mess.
Joke: Donald trump has the second hardest job!  The first.... Joe Biden's sign language interpreter!!  Haha
Yes, they are! Led by the 59% who will VOTE for Biden!!
Your take on a Biden Presidency being a massive tax increase on corporations right when it's not need needed is a lie. Joe wants to stimulate the economy by not by more corporate tax cuts put by putting more money in working peoples hands. Keep lying but it's not working!
Hey man I get it. Trump may say dumb things, but if you look he’s doing great things. Biden has had 40 years in office, and his most successful bill locked up more black Americans. Trump freed them with the First Step Act. Vote for who you want, I just ask you do your research
Thank you director Comey. We need you back where you belong and you will be as soon as Joe Biden is elected. Then you can prosecute Trump, Pence, Pompeo, and Barr to begin with. Can't wait.
Everyday it's something new demonstrating the character of the most useless and interior human being and POTUS in history. We need to get the message out to VOTE. Anyone who is not a Biden supporter, at least vote against Trump.. he must go to the trash
Well hell. I had decided against voting for you because of your chronic lying and corruption. Now that a NY Post article by Betsy says Biden will destroy my neighborhood,  maybe I need to change my mind. #justkidding
My main worry is with Biden we literally will be voting a puppet for progressive interests that were literally unable to beat the puppet during the primary season.  With Trump, they will still have a shot at impeachment if he gets worse, with Biden he will be insulated from that.
Race relations got worse on the streets under Obama/Biden.
Looks like a clip of trump's goon squad in Portland!  Why would you think this is Joe Biden's America, Trumper?  Biden will have to clean up trump's mess!

Seriously?? Joe Biden is at the very least, A HUMAN BEING!!  The current occupant in the White House is lacking any kind of capacity that one would associate with a human. Stupidity, racism, denial of the science in front of him, and what is the worst? He is a fucking TRAITOR!!
Biden is not a Socialist, and you would know that if you researched what Socialism is. Enjoy your Socialist police and fire departments; because yeah, that's what they are.
P.S. I know there is a decent amount of Kamala hype for VP from people, but my guess is Biden will pick Susan Rice. I have no basis for this guess but look forward to being right and will return to this tweet when the decision is made to spike the football or look foolish.
Also, it’s especially rich that people around Biden are making this argument since *Joe Biden* was a Vice President.... who now wants to be President.
Apparently some people around Biden are holding a grudge against her for not apologizing for going after him in that first debate (🙄) and are claiming that she is “too ambitious” or “just wants to be President.” Typically you don’t hear those charges about men in politics.
Misogyny in politics, a short thread: If you are like me and pay too close attention to politics (😪) you may know that we are apparently very close to finding out Joe Biden’s VP pick. There is speculation that it could be Kamala Harris.

We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.

Yeah, great idea, KellyAnne, to have Trump do his daily circus shows again!  You're giving Biden TONS of ammo!  :D
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.
My point is if Biden has a brain he will unite the Democratic Party with his VP pick. If he doesn’t, he never cared about the country to begin with. The ball is in his court. Only Biden can unite the party. Sad that you don’t have the confidence in him to do that.
Don't vote for Biden. Don't vote for Trump.  vote for who you want and reject the made up, yet overwhelmingly popular idea of a 2 party system.  but especially make sure you vote for the house and the senate conscientiously, they matter way more than the rapists on the ballot.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Biden MAGA!!!! Please!!!
Yup but at least it’s not bull from Biden.
My point is if Biden has any brains he will put country before internal party power and he will make a unity VP pick. We don’t have the luxury to be fussy. That’s my point. Biden must be a leader and unite the party! So that we can vote blue no matter what!

Agreed.  Joe Biden is a poor unfortunate soul.  Well said!
What a nonsense!  It's very good that Joe Biden won't be the President and the puppet of the left mob in the White House! Hard to get a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is even much worse than her.
Wrong! Trump is right! I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
I agree with that, portnoy probably should have told him. But I believe his personal politics and animosity towards Potus is what’s driving this. If portnoy interviewed a high level lib(like Biden) without telling him, something tells me he wouldn’t be so triggered.
In NH, the key will be if Sununu gets through and wins a 3rd term as Governor as Biden blows Trump out for President.  If he does, he holds all the cards. He could decide to take a shot at the White House lesving the door open for Ayotte-Hassan II.....
Hello. Thanks for the tweet. Here's the rationale. If Biden blows Trump out by 10+, it would mark the biggest landslide by a Dem in a Pres. Election since LBJ over Goldwater in '64 (60-39). 2 yrs. later Republicans had a huge year....
That bottom left photo is clearly photoshopped, which is obvious if you just google "crying flute girl". This is the origin of that shot. That person is Stephanie Carter, who has spoken out about people misusing the photo to wrongly attack Biden.

Lol what bubble are you in rn. Biden is a walking corpse. All the polls and information sources predicting hrc will win in 2016 are the ones telling you this. When biden tanks the general, youl hooefully remember this.
Yupp, sure sounds like a Biden supporter.  did say “if you vote trump then you ain’t black.” Bc be truly thinks that black ppl can not think for themselves just like the moron in this video

Greatness part one Nov 3rd when Biden wins... greatness part two when they drag Trump’s ass out of the White House on Jan 20th

You are so blind to what the problem is or this country needs. Biden is dead in the water. Its already done. Hes conceeded nothing, and cheated all the actual left in this country. Democrats are just republicans now.
This is pure comedy. Also how cool would it be if Biden actually did want to destroy the suburbs.

Oh, they know. Already working hard on sand bagging Biden. The Freedom Caucus even feels empowered to fret about the deficit again.
Do not get complacent.  Biden must win by a landslide. Everyone must vote. Masks, gloves,  whatever it takes.

So their argument against Biden is that we would be living in the country were living in now? 🤦🏻‍♀️
True to form, Biden's doesn't disavow his past views. His decrim proposal keeps the carceral state around marijuana largely intact: fines, drug courts, etc. He's awful.
Biden is just a place holder. His VP will become the candidate when he steps aside for health reasons.   And my money is on Michelle Obama.I’m just waiting for Biden to do the smart thing.  I do have some nurse overtime 💰💰💰 to donate.  Until then I’ll wait.
Biden too.
Biden FLAKED OUT ON your candidate.   Caved to BLM.   Stay mad at Khive though! 😉
Yup, the ‘senile’ Biden resigns, making Hillary president!! I wish I was kidding
their willingness to accept and welcome GWB before ever considering merely tolerating Bernie Sanders says everything we need to know about why they’re so fanatical about a Biden presidency.
i would vote for JOE BIDEN if he was KANYE WEST
The fact they would ELEVATE  a black woman so she can only  be dragged in a attempt to block one who  took Biden to task on his Dog whistle at a fundraiser.....  Man.
Think im fuckin playin. Im done Joe Biden gets nothing from me but a vote unless Kamala is on that ticket
Kamala is our VP! No one has worked harder, nonstop, addressing all the inequality and corruption with Our Constitution, from this current Administration. She suspended her campaign and went into Overdrive for Biden! Crown Our Queen, Joe!
My rankings 4 JOE's VP contd:  5 Mayor  6 NM  7 MI   All of these Women can energize our New Biden Coalition w their younger charm + campaigning skills.  PS: My 💙's w Demings. But I'm #ForThePeople #KamalaHarrisForVP. . .
I am.  The top of the ticket diesnt matter in a dark blue state so I'm ignoring it until Biden or anyone 70 or above  isn't on it.
Harris rubbed Jill Biden the wrong way.  This was AFTER Biden apologized for his Eastland Dog whistle.
They are the ones doing this. Biden 2020
Biden's campaign PANICKED.
only voting for Biden so I can stop reading the same tweet every other week:
The four that made sense to me three months ago.. before Biden's campaign flipped over Floyd.  Like black Folks gonna stay home over a VP pick.
Her record as prosecutor was fine.   Biden campaign punked out to BLM.
After Biden BAILED on her after her record having a shield came out.
Biden stubborn but not INSANE.   HE CAN'T BE! 😂😂😂
Kamala - just another politician. 👎🏾Rice - a DC lifer. 👎🏾
This is whats Triggering the ambition and loyalty questions.   It's HIS party. Biden called himself an Obama/Biden Democrat and ran on it.
If they ll do Harris like this....Any other black woman isn't exempt.   It's why I was  OPPOSED for so long to a black woman VP.  Biden is a Ed Burke type dem.  I grew up around this shit.
Same. I'm just about done with these crybabies who say they won't vote for Biden unless he picks "their" choice of VP. Joe Biden could pick Vlad the Impaler as his running mate and I'll still vote for him.
I research folks records..... and Biden was only good to block Sanders and Warren.  He did that.   He has no more use to me.
It is very disrespectful how Obama used John Lewis' funeral to urge us aboriginal (misnomer 'Black') people to vote for Biden - the same demon that not only raped women, but also helped in passing the 3 strike laws which further destroyed our families in the 90s under Clinton.

Oh my GOD! 😂😂😂😂  They drunk off polls at the Biden campaign! 😂😂😂
They want LOSE Florida! 😂😂  Biden ALREADY WEAK with Brown voters... you have Brown magazines and publications saying Harris for VP but let's fight about Castro?  In a state where Nelson and Gillum lost because of POOR BROWN SUPPORT with a Latina LG?!
Amy largely wasn't hit outside being a hard ass boss.   I pushed Biden Klobuchar HARD for months after Harris dropped out because I didn't want black women treated by a 1960s Democrat in Biden and his orbit this way.
Why did he apologize to black voters in SC.  Because he was wrong.  Again Biden dropped Amy like a hit potato over her record and you think Khive is what sank her VP chances!  Grow up.
Many thanks 45, thanks to you made Joe Biden a shoe in for a Nobel. Don't be mad you sold your soul for money not for a peace maker. You said you love chaos and there is no Nobel for chaos. Fool.
That's all this is.  They want The VP front runner to be humble and loyal to Biden and the Obama brand.   That's politics.
He had to apologize!😂😂😂  Joe Biden doesn't do that much.   No remorse... that's Dodd talking for Joe and Jill.   Apparently he felt his dog whistle wasn't wrong because Obama made him his WWC insurance after Hillary bust his ass with white no college in the 08 primary.
It seems Biden's campaign diesnt think that   Bass is a black Warren! 😂😂  That's all.
Privileged is thinking Biden will be  much different.  The working class will barely survive 4 more years of either as president.
Benghazi will NOT HURT RICE.  Castro can HURT Biden in Florida.
11. With so many people unemployed, they actually had time to stand in line all day at the polls.  12. Maybe one polling place for all of Kentucky was too much.  13. The Russians were really helping Biden.  14. Those phony mail-in ballots from China got stuck at customs.
So either way, it’s a win/win for the country. He’s yanked out kicking and threatening people and Pelosi or Biden are in charge.
Come November they'll accuse Biden of being a Muslim, being a satanist, and of eating babies in a ritualistic Catholic ceremony.
So everyone does bribery why not us!? Do you not see how that is how we got to Trump in the first place!? The Dems are supposed to be on the side of the people. Neoliberals normalize bribery and we wonder how we got Biden..
Oh me too man, I’m going to do another collection just between Khive Biden Bro’s and Bernie Bro’s. I’ll tag you when I post it.
If you were at a sandwich shop and 3-5 out of 10 of every customer you see there looks at the menu, doesn’t like the options and turns around. You would be blaming the customer. That’s all your doing here. Biden bro’s slogan is “Biden, if you don’t like him, well fuck you”
Feel like I’d like Joe Biden a lot more if he wrote his own tweets. It’s really the least he could do.

Of what? Joe Biden? 😹
How I miss our President, his morals, courage, and leadership. God help us find a way to have such leadership in the near future. Vote Biden 2020!
Bidens America?!?!? Trump is President right now!!! Its bc of him... not biden you uncultured swines.
Four years ago, they had it easy. Hillary Clinton had 30 years of hate to tap into. But Biden is a well-respected public figure. And since hate is the right's most potent tool, they have to make this election about other GOP boogeymen to keep the base scared.
Yeah, Biden is way more popular than Clinton ever was.
The way I see it, both groups, those who don't normally vote, and those who stayed home in 2016, have to be reached out to with equal fervor. Not just Sanders supporters. A lot of Black Obama voters stayed home in 2016, too. Biden's now popular than Hillary was, though.
The democrats straight up used a a funeral as an opportunity for Obama to give a speech they wish Joe Biden could give
What if Joe Biden picks a Black woman as his VP and on his second day in office, he resigns...not due to scandal or health concerns, but bc it's representative of what needs to happen in our country
They are probably lining up because after January 20th when Joe Biden becomes President, no one will remember who Pence is!
Does Biden have precogs on his team? Or maybe just some good psychologists who cab game out a narcissist while losing. Either way, he was right.

I’m not sure why everyone is so down on Joe Biden. He’s a perfectly reasonable Republican candidate.
#TrumpPresser :  fact check:  Biden does not want a fracking ban, he want to stop NEW permits.  Trump lied, things are NOT better in Fl.  He said he wants to stop evictions....there is nothing in the GOP bill addressing that.  No evidence of voter fraud.  #TrumpLies
And here's the thing. If Sanders was the candidate right now, I'd be fighting just as hard for him as I am for Biden. Politics is about compromise. There's no room for "I'm taking my ball and going home."
So will they call for a do-over on the judges and justices when Biden is elected? Otherwise, this means nothing.
On top of all the tweets from #45 about how Biden is a puppet of the "Radical Left," I've also been seeing tweets saying this election is "really" Trump vs. Obama, Trump vs. China. I think #45's party has realized they can't win against Biden.
I saw tweets from Progressives yesterday that have me worried. They said, in a nutshell, that Biden has to "earn" their vote by agreeing to progressive policies. I'm not telling them how to vote, but do they really think 4 more years of #45 is the right way to stick it to Biden?
Biden’s main excuse for backing the 94 Crime Bill is the support it had from the Congressional Black Caucus. Those members, which includes the late Congressman Lewis, were just as responsible as Clinton, Pelosi and the rest for laying the foundation for mass incarceration.
Why do all the Jews support democrats? Trump has done more for Israel than any other President. Biden is Catholic not a big Jew supporter. Blacks hate Jews, his VP will be black. Wake up Jews vote Trump!
You're clearly a Racist.... Supporting racist Biden.

Learned this during Obama’s second term when I realized he could easily avoid doing the work if he placed blame for the work not being done solely on his opponents. Same playbook Trump is using today and Biden will use if he wins.
Mr. Turley:  Joe Biden did nothing more than predict EXACTLY what is happening.  Trump wants to postpone the election.  Whether he can or not is irrelevant; even proposing it is yet another step towards authoritarianism.  You should apologize.
I'm SUPER looking forward to your tweet apologizing to Joe Biden and condemning Trump for doing EXACTLY the opposite of what you said.  Can't wait.
It might seem counterintuitive but for my sanity I have to assume Trump will win. I can’t be surprised by that again.  Intellectually and objectively it is FAR more likely Biden will.
Biden called him xenophobic because he was. Not because he stopped some (but all) travel from China.
I can teach you how to google. But in the meantime here is an elaborate description of why your statement is mostly false
Are Dems going to blame mail-in voting errors when Biden loses??
But all this to say, Joe Biden is the candidate precisely to not so subtly appeal to white nationalism in the Republican playbook, perhaps sincerely to get Lincoln Project adjacent conservatives on board. The Green Party even rigged their primary to placate the white nationalists
I say Kamala Harris will be Biden’s VP pick.   She’s obviously a horrible candidate but she’s the safest choice for Vice Puppet    Who agrees?
AOC and Biden and other demonKKKRats use "y'all"  and "ain't" to pander to black voters. "They gone put y'all back in chains".  "Ain't nothin' wrong with being a bartender".
delusional human beings. here's a guy that was the worst president in the history of America and destroyed our country in 8 years. brought it to its knees and the economy. what a failure. along with that mental case old man Joe Biden who's not even fit to run Burger King 🖕🏾
Joe Biden's running mate - none will satisfy all sections of the party | US elections 2020 | The Guardian
Nothing will stop me from voting in November for Biden!!!
“Mr. Trump has no authority to unilaterally change the date of the election, which is set by federal law.”
I do also very much buy that Biden is a guy who wants someone he can "eat lunch with" and Rice is the only one of the major contenders he already has a strong relationship with.
And people think Warren has a chance. This is how you end up with Tim Kaine. Or Al Gore. Or Joe Biden.
Ohio is a waste of time for Biden. Personally I’d go for Georgia. Two senate races and it hedges a loss of Wisconsin/PA
This is why people gotta stfu with their “I will dance in the streets on Nov 4!” and “X days until Biden’s inauguration!”  Stay on HIGH alert for fvckery. This is nowhere near over.
Don’t blame them. Kamala is just another politician.
No, please no. Rice is a Washington lifer through and through. I can’t  see her being any more popular than Hillary.
Look, Trump is a dumb as a box of rock. Everything that is coming out of his administration is from the racists, Nazis, fascist, lap dogs of Putin. Trump is there just to sign his name.   Biden VP pick is of little importance, being in the room where it happens, polices, laws, is

All I hear is “ we are voting for Biden “ . Stop sir you are going to make the whites cry . My timeline is a safe space . Biden going to win don’t mind him everyone . Everyone will go vote Biden and our country isn’t filled with ignorance 🤓
🤫 they gonna bookmark this and cyber bully you when Trump wins . We got to say we voted for Biden til they blame Russia, China, Green Party , Corona, mail in votes , electoral college , Kanye for their candidate being incompetent
TRUMP’S PROPOSALS WILL CONTINUE TO KILL THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS! WON’T NEED ANY JOBS IF HE KEEPS KILLING US OFF!!! TRUMP IS HAZARDOUS TO OUR HEALTH. THE GOP CAN KEEP SUCKING HIM FOR BRIBES, BUT AMERICANS ARE VOTING FOR BIDEN!!
Instead of complaining of Biden and the Democrats not having a black agenda try coming up with one where 90% of registered black voters and all the black fraternities, sororities, black churches, black organization, black professionals, &amp; black civil rights organization can do
Facts over your fake woke feelings!   Thank you  for this!
Husband and I have both requested mail in ballots. We will be voting for Biden as soon as they arrive and then dropping them off at our early voting facility on day one. Can’t wait!
What if instead of Senator Warren, Harris, or Stacy Abrams Joe Biden chose Julian Castro or Cory Booker?
I think her foreign policy record is complicated, but it is long. By political, you really mean electoral. Though, while never elected Rice has substantive experience in the Clinton/Obama administrations. Also, out of everyone in the running Rice is the closest to Biden.
should be ambitious and looking toward becoming the President.  Biden WILL be a one term President.  If white women can’t be ambitious what chance do women of color have to be ambitious?
We are in a #Coronavirus  black hole that will get larger &amp; by Nov there will be 500K Dead.  Trump will be mumbling #hydroxycholoroquine until the day they drag him out of the WH.  On Day 1 Joe Biden will unleash the power of the USA &amp; a new dawn begins.  Cue the🌞🌞☀️
#RacistInChief is a perfect description of Biden if he would win in November...not Trump

The difference is Biden views may have changed and Donald Trump are unbelievable and still unchanged. You are not a human being and Trump has one black person in his white supremacy team that so UnAmerican !History of racism out weighs Biden History of racism .Who’s more American
When I think of Joe Biden I think of one of thousands of Young black men that got caught up in Clinton and Biden crimeBill that  state BLM kids to be predators without a hand of restorative justice until now. Why should I vote for Biden  now? When I wasn’t a predator then or now?
Biden is too high in the White Votes, he’s been trying to knock it down.  Next time he will wear his KKK outfit screaming  MAGA.
My excitement level regarding Biden is like 0.4/10 but I would love to have a president that isn’t openly racist and cares more about curbing the pandemic than reminding us where it came from

1st of all not sure who you’re talking to but you’re not in charge of other’s thoughts or opinions, this is my post, so beat it. 2nd talking points and political phrases are common, reminders about personal feelings on possible VP , says something about Biden.

Raise your hand if you think if Biden’s elected, Trump will refuse today leave the White House.
Biden isn’t the president... yet
has been on the trail with Biden for more than a year. She knows her stuff!
That’s because you found a video of Biden campaigning in Iowa before Covid hit and you are therefore posting fake news.  Stop making things up.

The problem with Biden unlike Trump is he brings allot of political badgage with him. Good or bad it is allot.  It is too bad they could not find a more center person with trumps political experience. The biggest problem we have are these career politicians.
like yeah the military is so scared of Joe Biden giving them a blank check every year that they’ll back a fucking coup. grow up and start phone banking
I didn't know why the American Dream eluded me until  educated me.  My mother has passed on but she thought Warren was a sensational lady.  #Democrats a Biden and Warren #Election2020 ticket can be our moment &amp; time.  #Biden2020 #BidenWarren
Also, I think we both know that Biden is most likely not going to be one in charge.  His  VP most likely will be....his VP is going to be even more on the left than he is...
As, to Bernie supporters not supporting Biden.  I hope that's the case, I hope they not that stupid to actually support him.  However there's graph based on his platform vs Trump's platform that shows that  Biden moved significantly more to the left than Trump to the right.
Here comes Biden/Whitmer
I'm struggling like the rest of you. Our president has no compassion he has no empathy because he never has. Let's bring America back around to the progressive nature that we were headed to. United we stand divided we fall. We will not be divided or subjected to communism. Biden!
Why don't you explain why you think Biden would do better than Trump with the economy and for Black Americans?
Actually,  Joe Biden is pretty left right now..on his policies. Federal National gun ban is NOT centrist policy,  it's leftist policy.  Wouldn't you say so?
It’s amazing how bernie Bros will construct false narratives about biden but not actually chime in here. Actually... not amazing. Just deeply, and expectedly, hypocritical.
Are you insane? 150k people are dead! The economy is wrecked. Child poverty is somehow getting even fucking worse!  And you're sitting here perpetuating some bs about Biden's cognitive ability before the first debate?
There could be countless volumes written about the absolutely tremendous political opportunity the Democratic Party seems so intent on squandering in this historical moment.  Biden has no idea who his allies are or what they’re fighting for.
And so many of the field would love round 2 without those three B’s in the race. Bernie with his 25%, Bloomberg’s money and Biden’s name
‘It's absolutely serious’: Susan Rice vaults to the top of the VP heap  via
Biden won’t get us there and I’m worried his win will bring more complacency. Dnc fucked around and we promised they would find out. If we ring empty on that promise, we are asking for more of the same neoliberal bullshit.
And with Biden, he don’t need no education. He’s not wet behind the ears like Obama or Bill Clinton.
My guess is they pre-wrote it and included a placeholder Biden quote where the real one would go. I find it hard to believe Biden would give Politico the script, unless maybe it was leaked? Who knows.
As the President is currently pushing this drug that has been proven it wont cure Covid! But yeah Biden is wrong! Yeah ok Spicey!
The Democratic party's entire strategy this cycle is to tell you to vote for Biden because he's not Trump. This is their shield to block any discussion of progressive issues. Reminds me of when Republicans would merely shout 9/11 anytime they were challenged.
👍🏽 Andrew Yang's quiet campaign for Joe Biden
I was on the selection committee and this was the #1 reason you were chosen. Biden also loves your podcast.

Something I've been thinking about lately. Looking at all these false claims #45 has been making about Joe Biden. I get a feeling that his tactic is going to be to swamp Biden with false claims that he's forced to deny, leaving almost no time to state his own views on things.
What’s the point of polling Mass for Biden vs Trump? May as well poll Red Sox vs Yankees
This is why Biden will lose. He’ll blame everyone and everything but this is the reason. It’s obvious.
If Biden wins that will be #1 talking points. How are we going to deal with the massive deficit the Democrats have. It will be like they have amnesia from what happened in the last 4 years of the Dump.
“Judicial” committee? Democrat members are previewing Biden Admin KANGAROO COURT procedures, where guilt and sentencing are predetermined by identity- race, sexuality, relationship to Joe Biden... no testimony needed. If  doesn’t win, this is what we’ll get.
Per Jim Jordan’s opening statement in the #BarrHearing, the “Obama-Biden DOJ” employed a “secret agent lady” to spy on Trump’s campaign.    Was it this one?
I’m guessing fear of Biden around teens.
picked this guy to analyze Trump/Biden COVID differences. He supported “everyone go to Chinatown and the bars!” when we should have been social distancing. Also like Biden, said nothing about masks or isolating nursing homes or HCQ until POLITICS. Not a leader.
Me leaving the voting booth in 98 days. I seriously cannot wait to vote for #biden and end this nightmare
Biden seems to have learned the lesson of GOP obstructionism during the Obama years. They've been making noise that they won't let anything slow them down if the Dems have the majority on the Hill.
Also, fwiw, Biden is not running as far left as Warren or Sanders would have been, but his platform will still make the country tangibly better.  Bankruptcy reform, his housing policy, childcare funding--all of those will be good for Americans.
Why are peoplw tearing their hair out because the DNC platform dowsnt endorse Medicare for All? I'm in favor of it, but Biden didn't support it and won the primary by a wide margin. Of course it's not gonna be in the platform.
Conservatives understand Biden would be worse.
SHE SHOULD KEEP WORKING ON HER HOOKER MAKE-UP! SHE WON’T BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY A NEW GARDEN. BIDEN MIGHT WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THEN THE GARDEN WOULD GET DUG UP &amp; MONEY WASTED. SHE SHOULD JUST START PACKING.
If Biden is a fascist the I'm from Mars. Watch who you listen to there are plenty of fair minded ppl who can't see he is a good fair family man. Na nu na nu.

You said “ANY republican” not, “any republican that can win” trust me, there’s a lot worse than Trump. Honestly, he’s not even a conservative any more than he’s a Neo-Facist. Honestly, Joe Biden is more of a Conservative IMO. We’ve seen the Overton window move so durastically
Joe Biden potentially picking Karen Bass as his running mate cuz that's what we need right now, a Karen in the White House 🤦🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️😂
Honestly, this is so strategic.  doing an  VP tease on 7/31 + will likely raise a sh*t ton of money going into August. It is a win, win for the eventual Biden-? team. As much as I love the sound of Vice President Warren, I think it will be someone else.
this is called the act of thwarting hedonic adaptation: by imagining a future without Biden as Prez, we gain clarity on how badly we need him in office — as well as how much better our lives will be when Trump is donezo.
Prefer Obama Ebola Czar  lawyer? Who said they got “lucky” with H1N1 that infected 50M people? Who let people with Ebola into the country to spread it here? Who quit before a vaccine? Who touts Joe Biden for wearing a mask on May 25 after CDC screwed testing? Lies?:
1) New Zealand stopped China travel best. Trump tried, Biden cried, you/Pelosi lied, more died 2) Biden CDC test plan was disaster, Trump gave US most tests on earth 3) Trump said wear mask.. April 3; Biden.. May 25?! 4) Biden said nothing on nursing homes! 5) Lies: HCQ and this-
This should be universal. If Biden had, say, a national high speed rail proposal to be announced at the convention - well, it would be painfully easy to cash in on that.

Biden rode shotgun with Obama for two terms... I don’t know why the media &amp; Bernie Democrats act like they don’t know Joe... #TheBeatThey're going 2b a prob once Biden is pres. Biden didn't win fairly the DNC's corruption propped him, rigged the election, forced ppl to vote in person.  They will not undo anything the Repubs have done.

If you change the manager at a slaughterhouse, does that make it not a slaughterhouse?  Replacing Donald Trump with Joe Biden doesn't fix the slaughterhouse we call America!   The slaughterhouse is the problem, not the manager!   #VoteThirdParty
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   I’m over 65, everything about Biden &amp; the Democratic Party disgusts me. They don’t care about people &amp; especially seniors, dem  run cities &amp; states ignored long term care
In 100 days we're going to make liberals cry again and Biden's going to the ex politicians retirement home
There's nothing progressive abt Joe Biden!
Go back to sleep grandpa Biden
Obama and Biden 8 years they did nothing but screw the American people, watching them is like watching paint dry, no thanks #Trump2020LandslideVictory #PromisesMadePromisesKept #FourMoreYearsjokes with him every show since he first mentioned her because he mentions her so consistently.  I mean, it's not a bad idea, but I think Harris or Demmings would be better choices.  No matter what, I'm riding with Biden.
The population of the USA is approximately 328 million, how will they explain 400 million mail-in votes for Biden.
This presidential election is probably the best example I have seen so far. Trump vs Biden. A lot of people don't like either choice. The idea of protesting/activism doesn't even occur to them. What can people accomplish with both?
They're going 2b a prob once Biden is pres. Biden didn't win fairly the DNC's corruption propped him, rigged the election, forced ppl to vote in person.  They will not undo anything the Repubs have done.  How can we trust a party that has clearly failed us repeatedly during DT.
An attempt to break the Biden coalition by projecting their racism on to it.
They'll be Biden's treasure to exploit Right now,we have a few important probs
I am a mid aged white man. I believe in 2A and BLM and being responsible with my tax money and helping every part of society. Trump is not anyone’s president. He is an illusion. Don’t fall for it! I want a candidate who is like me, until then I’m voting Biden
Trump is Foxifying VOA. Remember the normal people who ran the VOA and quit mid June, only to be replaced by Trumpsters? 6 weeks later...
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
Trump is doing an AWESOME job of defining himself in terms favorable to Biden. Please proceed.
I cannot believe I am going to have to vote for Joe fucking Biden this year. You win, universe.
Gonna be interesting when he refuses to cede power to Biden if Biden wins.
You can take that picture of me and put a “Biden Will Win 2020” as a heading to remind you that you’ll be paying me $1200 since you are creeping on me. It’s one way to rationalize your stalking of me I guess. 96 days.....
Now you’re creeping on my new picture of me and my disceased mom from 2016? Are you really fucking that sick or do you get off from creeping on people? I know you are mentally ill being a Trump supporter and having those Biden videos, but creeping on me is really sick.
Is this when President Biden announces a real plan to deal with COVID-19 in 2021!
And I may be trash to you, but at least I don’t support, defend, and vote for trash. You can say all you want about what Biden might of done, but he cares about America unlike Trump who you support and that’s what makes you even worse than trash in this world. 97 days...
Idiot. There are gun control laws that prohibit the unlawful possession of guns. Only a mentally ill person could believe a new law will stop illegal gun ownership. She needs to be Biden's running mate. Both clueless.
And you follow Justin Beiber and call Joe Biden a pervert!?!?😂😂😂😂😂 how old are you? And you call me a kid? I knew you were a pervert based on previous messages but seeing who you follow (Gym Jordan) proves it. Lmao.
...a first grader doesn’t know how to social distance and many school teachers are over the age of 50 putting them at serious risk. Trump doesn’t care about Americans. He cares about re-election only and that’s pathetic. 97 days until Biden is president elect.
Hey  - you have been on a tyrade about censoring ads/showing political bias, and specifically at Google. You say it’s “obvious”, and you want them to pledge not to help Joe Biden. Did you forget the below??? Why are you the only one crying?
Joe Biden being president from a Trans Am seems like it would cause Amy Carter’s Shoe’s to explode in orgasmic joy.  cc:
In my estimation, Rice would be the best to try and repair the damage to our Foreign relations. Whether as VP, or Another Senior Cabinet Official Post Let our new POTUS, JOE BIDEN, decide. He'll pick his BEST 2nd IN COMMAND AND TOGETHER they will pick the very BEST,and BRIGHTEST!
They won't provide security and they will probably cancel it anyway because they're planning on running Joe Biden from his basement if he's awake
Don't be surprised if Oprah Winfrey is named Biden's running mate.
Don't be surprised if Oprah Winfrey steps in the race as Biden's running mate.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Biden MAGA!!!! Please!!!
Yup but at least it’s not bull from Biden.
Liars! We always have a choice. No one can take that away from us. It's a shame that Dems really think that they have us by the balls.  I'm voting third party... Hell to the no on Joe Biden! I just can't do it, even if its to vote DT out.
...not to help people because he doesn’t care about people. He NEVER has. You are just a sheep who follows what the herd is doing and can’t think for herself. You don’t care for others and are blind. Sad.....98 days till Biden is president elect. Bet me.
jpwtweets Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry.  jpwtweets
Biden is pitiful
Biden is lost!
John Lewis’ was in state today. You didn’t go. And you didn’t even tweet condolences for a man who got the crap beat out of him because he was black, and fought the injustice until his death. What did you today? “Words on Twitter are mean to me.”
Biden will not be in the debates. No way, no how. They are already scheming for ways to get him out.
No way especially if he debates Biden he will eat him alive polls can lie
If you change the manager at a slaughterhouse, does that make it not a slaughterhouse?  Replacing Donald Trump with Joe Biden doesn't fix the slaughterhouse we call America!   The slaughterhouse is the problem, not the manager!   #VoteThirdParty
And $1200 ($2400 if you really were confident) will be mine when Biden wins in a rout.
#SalsaTheVote !?!? Can someone tell bitch ass Biden and the Democrats to get this shit off Twitter quick and in a hurry!!!!
I know a few republicans who are voting for Biden because Trump is a danger to the US.
And Kathy, know some facts when you argue. You literally work three jobs in Trumps America and you think he’s done anything to help you? No he hasn’t. You are a dumb conservative who needs a reality check when you wages increase when Biden wins. But you’ll complain there. 99 days
Wow, I didn’t see Biden embrace anything like that.
Yeah I don't get it. 59% of Trump voters have been contacted..  and 59% of Biden voters have been contacted
Are you obsessed with an doctored video? The polls shows no one cares. And that he’s going to win. He has empathy and cares about our troops. A misleading video doesn’t change that. You’re the one who supports a known rapist. Haha lame. 100 days until Biden is president elect...
You’re the one who supports hate and evil. Take the bet, coward. Or you know I’m going to win. 100 days till Biden is president elect. You are a child. Lmao.
😂 WTF? Are you serious? You have to stop watching Alex Jones. The whole issue the liberals and progressives have against Biden is that he's Republican Lite™. He's what the GOP thinks it is. He's what a Republican is when cameras are turned on.
So how is Biden going to save us from Fox News?
Don't commit to any party, make them EARN your vote. Having said that, vote Biden. He's the second shittiest candidate in the history of politics, but we are facing literal destruction of America with a second Trump term.
Biden organizers say campaign is 'suppressing the Hispanic vote' in Florida, mistreating staff
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Trump USA 🇺🇸. Biden no way !
Just saw the first Biden ad. Wow. So full of shit. Dems has 4 years and wasted it.
Maybe you take votes away from Biden and because of that we get another 4 years of Donnie. It’s probably your end game, tbh. Doesn’t make you any more relevant though, sorry pal.
Obama/Biden split the nation in two. Beat Trump to the punch.
There's nothing progressive abt Joe Biden!
Or grab little girls. Democrats are two things, 1) hypocrites 2) have no standards but the double standard. Believe all women unless you are Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein.  . . .
Well put! He’s a blank slate on which his supporters can project their memories and dreams. Unlike King Barry, though, Biden is or was a known quantity. If his voters want to remember him as an affable goofball, so be it. If they think he’ll support anarchy, he will.
agreed "any adult" other than Biden in 2020 would do, sorta like in 2016, anyone other than Hillary.
You really need to stop this. Socialism isn’t happening get off your high horse and help us elect a real man. Joe Biden. He is far from corrupt.
Biden is going to usurp Pinky and the Brain.
You’re destroying everything now. Biden will have his hands full rebuilding to MAGA.
#GoJoe This is good-   Biden HQ: We know you've been waiting for it -- Joe and President Obama's full conversation is finally here!  Don't miss a minute of 44 and 46's in-person chat. Watch the full video:
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland [and Herman Talmadge].  Well, guess what?  At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn’t agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished." Joe Biden - 2019
"You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking." Joe Biden - 2006
💙💙💙 I don’t even like Joe Biden’s policies. He is way too conservative for a center/left voter but we really need to get rid of Trump and his ilk. Still wish Bernie would have wonThe military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform

That bottom left photo is clearly photoshopped, which is obvious if you just google "crying flute girl". This is the origin of that shot. That person is Stephanie Carter, who has spoken out about people misusing the photo to wrongly attack Biden.

Never get comfortable, act as if Biden is losing by 14 points.
Honestly it’s easier just to block, he does it with both Trump and Biden and somehow always winds up on top of the comments

But also, your ass better be voting for Joe Biden in November because I’m not signing up for 4 more years of this.
Trump, Biden, and Sean Connery. I’m in
Literally there is your argument when someone says Joe Biden used to be a piece of shit. Because he did used to be a piece of shit. No doubting that.
I love how they talk about what #Biden used to say and not about how there’s a possibility that maybe the guy changed his goddamn mind and saw how fucking fucked they all were
Florida residents should by now realize that they were robbed of your leadership in this national crisis, hopefully Joe Biden has a place for you.
What Does Susan Rice Bring to a Biden Ticket? Protection?
Probably giving Biden’s campaign speech since he can’t do it

As in the 2016 election, if Trump actually wins this one, I believe you are correct Wesley, it will just fade away.  Joe Biden et Al willtl fade away from public view and punishment.
Ill vote in person for sure now! Make sure my biden vote counts
While I wish we could delay a second Trump term or a Biden first term, indefinitely, this trick doesn’t usually enhance democracy elsewhere.
Chris Wallace calls Biden out for turning down interview request  #Election2020 #MediaWatch
Hey if the Dems have to put the Trump's choice through the ringer while Biden takes over then I'm good with that. Majority will win out but put his pick through it hard. Trump made it that way so it shall be this time. Don't make it easy.
Don’t you find it troubling that Biden’s handler has to pull him along is your #TrumpDerangementSyndrome that bad?!
jae is your average Biden voter. Doesn't even have a room temperature IQ.
We’re stocking up on staples and toilet paper, this fall and winter will be a challenge, the Biden Administration is going to be faced with cleaning up Trump’s many failures for years to come.
Oh dear lord if biden actually chooses kamala harris...
Mr Biden please pick Kamala Harris for vice president I think she is the greatest and I think she will add so much to your party
Can we please riot over the fact the DNC is still gonna nominated Biden? The American people are being severely fucked by this.
Dis dood Biden just said “I think...” lmao buddy no you didn’t
When anyone tells you they’re planning to vote for Biden, show any of these clips from today’s hearing and inform them that these crazies—not Biden—will be in power:
We deserve to know what went down in Oval Office on January 5, 2017 as it relates to the framing of a 3-star general and incoming NSA. What exactly did Biden say?  Yates knows the details—allowing her to testify behind closed doors next week is useless. Oh and make it under oath.
Dear  Sally Yates signed 1st FISA. She sat in on Oval Office meeting with Obama/Biden to discuss Flynn set-up. She told McGahn that Flynn was compromised by Russians. Good chance she illegally leaked Flynn call/Page FISA to WashPo. She needs to testify in public.
The (not)funny part about anyone saying that things will get worse if Biden wins is that A) it’s the first pandemic in 100 years B) unemployment is highest since Depression C) US just passed the largest socialist bailout since Depression Give me some worse stuff...
I have no idea why Biden is associated with this, but the #Vikings #beardown
If you need a good laugh, check this out: Ben Stein as Joe Biden—
WTF. What year does Biden think it is????
She should consult with Jill Biden on this project.
Joe Biden loves women, sexual assault, sniffing kids, pedophile you know that kinda love.
Joe Biden= sexual assault, sniffing kids, pedophile, never having to answer for anything. That's what u want. It's sad really.
That is Joe Biden’s America! We must win in November! #RememberInNovember
Joe Biden is so far ahead that Dem operatives are blaming urban riots on him because landslide.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You’re trailing far behind Biden by a lot. Kanye took away voters from u lol
Another idea: Ads about Obama’s “Shadow White House” and who’ll be back in power because it won’t be Biden. Hillary Clinton as Attorney General. Elizabeth Warren as Treasury Secretary. AOC at EPA. Bernie Sanders at HUD. Pete Buttigieg as Sec of State. Michelle Obama on SCOTUS.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
I don’t think republicans are backing Biden though, are they?
Twitter suppressed the comments on this article. I would bet anything that they were all about Bernie's tremendous success with Hispanic voters and Biden's absolute incompetence.
Nazi, Racist, Facist, lmao people throw those words out like it's nothing how bout these words. Joe Biden sexual predater, likes sniffing kids, pedophile, doesn't answer for anything. 👍
Socialists see Joe Biden as ripe for the picking, ready to mold  #bestofwashtimes
Steyer literally tweeted something supporting Joe Biden 8 hours before you tweeted this and Bloomberg make his support for Biden clear after he dropped out of the Race.
Maybe, but I doubt. Biden don’t have the following, sanders voters hate Biden, the dems has 4 yrs to find a decent criminal, but failed.
Thank you. All he had to do was not kill it! Uh 😯 wait he couldn’t even manage to to do that. My 🩸 boils every time I 👂 “I had the best economy”. No you inherited a very good economy that was still climbing. He could NEVER do what Obama/Biden did.
58% think Biden would do a better job handling China. CHINA
This is the deal: Elect Biden and all this goes away. Until then, the lockdowns, coronavirus hysteria, and rioting will continue. And if Trump wins, it gets worse. People are picking up on this—the fear is many will take the deal.
If Biden wins, they’ll have nothing to do with them. If Trump wins, they’ll remain outcasts with a spotless losing record. The Lincoln Project is run by a former Russian lobbyist, a bankrupt professional tweeter, McCain’s failed campaign manager and Mr. Kellyanne Conway. Yikes:
Oh like Obama /Biden right... 🤦‍♂️
Socialists see Joe Biden as ripe for the picking, ready to mold  #washtimesoped
he is talking about, we already have a person in the White House who won’t do q&amp;a, and clearly doesn’t know what he is doing, which is why he can’t answer. Now what is Biden’s excuse? He must show he can do this job. Trump needed to take that test obviously; Biden will
I think you should remove yourself; just listen to you on CNN, and you did not do a good job, your defending Biden was weak, &amp; left with unanswered questions. Biden is in fight with a tyrant and he needs to show he can handle this job. He should answer q&amp;a. He should know what
Hey Eric is it true that Biden is being prosecuted in the Ukraine for withholding a billion dollars if the prosecuting attorny wasnt fired? Saw on youtube but havent heard a word fron anywhere elseI think Biden wants to pick someone with whom he feels comfortable + has a good rapport. I think his head tells him Warren or Harris, but his heart tells him Rice. I think Biden is someone who'll follow his heart. I'm excited to see how it all plays out!
Curious what would happen to the whole #Karen meme if Biden ends up picking Karen Bass as a running mate.
Harris talks ambition in women of color after personal attacks during Biden's VP search
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Yeah he definitely will not show up for Biden‘s inauguration
Joe Biden could still lose this election
That's what they dont get. Even if I believed these things about Biden, trump is still the worse candidate becuase he is a worse human being.
The Top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as vice president
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden

Biden's climate plan won praise from progressives. Now he needs their votes.

“Those are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality.”            — Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh, on ABC News on April 23, after Joe Biden warned that President Trump would try to delay the election.
So I have a question: if Biden gets 40,000,000 more votes than Yam Tits, could the Electoral College still hand the presidency to Mango Mussolini?
This is Biden's plan, the Democrats are engaging in Genocide. From Planned Parenthood to this curriculum, you've never seem people blk people so represented than when their talking about this stuff. They even made sure they added brn and blk to the flag to show our participation.
Pretty sure he was talking to Biden, there, right?
That's one small piece of the puzzle. Biden was also articulating a sensible plan for response while Trump was still claiming that it was just going to go away and we didn't need to do anything.
“Joe Biden’s election will end national nightmare 2.0, the nation’s second domestic debacle in two generations. Hell, Thomas Hobbes supposedly said, is truth seen too late, and in 2020, the nation,”  . . . has seen it in the “nick of time.”
Well...this is terrifying and entirely plausible
i know this is Very Bad, but until i saw this twete from our stupid and evil president i really was expecting biden to fuck up and blow it just like clinton
Thomas Friedman just stated to the effect - if Biden wins, form a unity government - Romney as Secretary of State and AOC for UN Ambassador
Yes, they’ve concluded trump is a one term president and it’s now time to start undermining Biden.
Hell of a tweet to see immediately after reading this article about "moral outrage" directed at ambitious women:
As big tech CEO's testify -  Democrats: "we love capitalism" Also democrats: "except when it works"  Republican Jim Jordan (snorts line) : "WiLl GoOglE usE thEiR priVatE iNfO to MakE JoE BidEn wiN?"  Just create regulation independently from what these clowns have to say
McConnell won't ever pick it up, but if we can get H.R. 1 passed in a Biden admin, it would do a lot of work to expand voting access, including a national holiday.
For those asking, this is not an official joe biden campaign thing. You can find the site at   It is pretty funny though
Polling is pointing towards Biden 48-46
Replying to a monster who says "I want 50m people uninsured" w "listen, Mack, what if we aimed for more like 20m?" is not a standard I'm comfortable supporting, but your point is a good one. I hope Biden wins, nearly as much as I hope he begins to support policies that help ppl
Lol what bubble are you in rn. Biden is a walking corpse. All the polls and information sources predicting hrc will win in 2016 are the ones telling you this. When biden tanks the general, youl hooefully remember this.
Yupp, sure sounds like a Biden supporter.  did say “if you vote trump then you ain’t black.” Bc be truly thinks that black ppl can not think for themselves just like the moron in this video
What does anyone think we will have with a Biden Admin?!
Biden said today he wants a VP choice that he can be comfortable with well that kind of tilts the scales towards Susan Rice now instead of Kamala Harris
Whoever did Biden's makeup we need to chat. One orange presidential candidate is one too many
If Michelle Obama decides to run as an independent and picked Anthony Fauci as her running mate, I might be persuaded to vote against Biden.
The DNC's anti-#cannabis vote is no surprise when Biden's team stacked in folks like Marty Moylan (see below), a former sex toy salesman &amp; IL State Rep known for 80s-era talking points &amp; once threatening to beat up a rival. This is who decides the future.
Joe Biden wants this to be capped at no more than $1150
But Biden &amp; the DNC align with this dope, so that's a winner🤮
Filled in my application for MAIL IN Ballot. Biden 2020
you was right. A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn’t pretty
Shocking no one, Biden &amp; the DNC drag us *backwards* on drug policy. The racist carceral state continues, with fines, jail, forced rehab, stigma, terminating parental rights (&amp; continuing racial disparities in all the above), to "protect" society from a freaking plant. #cannabis
Greatness part one Nov 3rd when Biden wins... greatness part two when they drag Trump’s ass out of the White House on Jan 20th
Transparent. There is no move of Biden to the "left." Delegate protest at the convention? Right. DemExit. Join the struggle for socialism.
That as a *very* good Biden ad.
In just the Champaign and Urbana ZIP codes, Joe Biden had collected $54,138 through June 30. President Donald Trump had amassed $19,204.
Just like the Merrick garland nomination was put on hold (and scuttled) till the election so should Melanie’s garden revamp... let the NEW First Lady (Biden) do it
Reading the comments to her FB post is it any surprise we are where we are today! One of my biggest hopes is if/when Biden is elected all these imbeciles go crawl back under the rocks from which they came and stay there in the dark where they belong. That and karma pays back big!
This is the study superselfesteem mind drip their feeding to blk women so they can get on board with Biden's vote. Drip! Blk woman VP, Dribble, Dribble, Beyonce, DRIBBLE, Dribble,Dribble Michelle Obama. And AHH! Mental masturbation, climax I must vote Democrat.😆😅😂
In all honesty anyone who supports joe Biden or is a Democrat should be lined up and all shot in the head
PLEASE PLEASE DON’T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. 46.9% is simply unacceptable. I hope you vote for Biden but if you don’t that’s your right - BUT PLEASE PLEASE VOTE YOUR ASS OFF!
I personally find her to be a job hopper (all the short term positions she’s had, never completes a full term before hopping to the next higher office) but yes having said that. Yes she is the best choice for Biden to win...
Dear media, If Ted is setting the bar at Biden having to respond to a social media post from a county board candidate, he needs to answer for every single hateful &amp; sick tweet from Trump
Joe Biden Makes Caregiving A Central Part Of His New Economic Plan
Meh, would have preferred Warren.  But at this point, anyone Biden picks would still be better than Trump-Pence.  And she's probably been pretty thoroughly vetted by this point.

I don't think Biden needs more money. He needs more votes.
Vote for Kanye if you want him to give Joe Biden a hand job.
😁😁😁 GOOD MORNING BROWN EYES!!! Happy to “see” you.  I don’t think that issue will be addressed until the Biden Administration starts.
I just wanna know how Obama is feeling about Biden and his decisions lately.. they WERE bffs, right??
What an endorsement for the biden.
Biden &amp; Trump should take standardized IQ tests (no cheating Donald!)  the same time, in the same room, etc. Let’s see who wins.
You are so blind to what the problem is or this country needs. Biden is dead in the water. Its already done. Hes conceeded nothing, and cheated all the actual left in this country. Democrats are just republicans now.
This is pure comedy. Also how cool would it be if Biden actually did want to destroy the suburbs.
The Point: Why it's a *really* big deal that Texas is now a 2020 swing state
Obama and Biden jab Trump coronavirus response in new video
Oh, they know. Already working hard on sand bagging Biden. The Freedom Caucus even feels empowered to fret about the deficit again.

True to form, Biden's doesn't disavow his past views. His decrim proposal keeps the carceral state around marijuana largely intact: fines, drug courts, etc. He's awful.
Biden is just a place holder. His VP will become the candidate when he steps aside for health reasons.   And my money is on Michelle Obama.Yes noticeably young. So disturbing. Biden needs to be talking about our education system
Oh and to be clear:  If you didn’t/don’t want the MLB season to occur because you are worried about player safety, I get it. That was probably the wisest decision. But also, your ass better be voting for Joe Biden in November because I’m not signing up for 4 more years of this.

We deserve to know what went down in Oval Office on January 5, 2017 as it relates to the framing of a 3-star general and incoming NSA. What exactly did Biden say?  Yates knows the details—allowing her to testify behind closed doors next week is useless. Oh and make it under oath.
Dear  Sally Yates signed 1st FISA. She sat in on Oval Office meeting with Obama/Biden to discuss Flynn set-up. She told McGahn that Flynn was compromised by Russians. Good chance she illegally leaked Flynn call/Page FISA to WashPo. She needs to testify in public.
I have no idea why Biden is associated with this, but the #Vikings #beardown
If you need a good laugh, check this out: Ben Stein as Joe Biden—
She should consult with Jill Biden on this project.
Joe Biden loves women, sexual assault, sniffing kids, pedophile you know that kinda love.
Joe Biden= sexual assault, sniffing kids, pedophile, never having to answer for anything. That's what u want. It's sad really.
That is Joe Biden’s America! We must win in November! #RememberInNovember
Joe Biden is so far ahead that Dem operatives are blaming urban riots on him because landslide.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Another idea: Ads about Obama’s “Shadow White House” and who’ll be back in power because it won’t be Biden. Hillary Clinton as Attorney General. Elizabeth Warren as Treasury Secretary. AOC at EPA. Bernie Sanders at HUD. Pete Buttigieg as Sec of State. Michelle Obama on SCOTUS.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Twitter suppressed the comments on this article. I would bet anything that they were all about Bernie's tremendous success with Hispanic voters and Biden's absolute incompetence.
Nazi, Racist, Facist, lmao people throw those words out like it's nothing how bout these words. Joe Biden sexual predater, likes sniffing kids, pedophile, doesn't answer for anything. 👍
Socialists see Joe Biden as ripe for the picking, ready to mold  #bestofwashtimes
this tweet shows kanyes intentions with running for president. He wants to disrupt the election and take votes from Biden so that Trump can win.
Biden with continually the most generic and awful tweets that mean nothing.
Maybe, but I doubt. Biden don’t have the following, sanders voters hate Biden, the dems has 4 yrs to find a decent criminal, but failed.
Thank you. All he had to do was not kill it! Uh 😯 wait he couldn’t even manage to to do that. My 🩸 boils every time I 👂 “I had the best economy”. No you inherited a very good economy that was still climbing. He could NEVER do what Obama/Biden did.
58% think Biden would do a better job handling China. CHINA
This is the deal: Elect Biden and all this goes away. Until then, the lockdowns, coronavirus hysteria, and rioting will continue. And if Trump wins, it gets worse. People are picking up on this—the fear is many will take the deal.
If Biden wins, they’ll have nothing to do with them. If Trump wins, they’ll remain outcasts with a spotless losing record. The Lincoln Project is run by a former Russian lobbyist, a bankrupt professional tweeter, McCain’s failed campaign manager and Mr. Kellyanne Conway. Yikes:
Gestapo trump has mess this country up so bad who would want to be president to clean this up. God bless you Biden
Oh like Obama /Biden right... 🤦‍♂️
Socialists see Joe Biden as ripe for the picking, ready to mold  #washtimesoped
Has he lost his mind just like creepy Biden this makes me soo
The way Donald Trump is going after  this afternoon, wow! It’s not like a new  for Florida came out showing Trump 13 points down to Biden in the Sunshine State—oh, wait a minute!
Hey Eric is it true that Biden is being prosecuted in the Ukraine for withholding a billion dollars if the prosecuting attorny wasnt fired? Saw on youtube but havent heard a word fron anywhere elseRemember when Capriles went running to Elliot Abrams with the proposal that the Americans appoint him President of Venezuela and then Abrams said no.  Maybe his buddy Leo Martinez told him that he'd have better luck under Biden which is why he won't STFU.
She fights the good fight everyday!! Vote Biden so she can walk away when she wants to.  #VoteBlueForRBG
You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden and his allies should really drop the whole he'll never meet with Maduro line if he chooses tankie, Karen Bass, as VP.  Or is he just being literal with this because he'll just send VP Bass down to Caracas for a "We Love Maduro" pep rally.
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
Going to suck when Biden gives Trump and his senior administration blanket pardons after Trump refuses to concede.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn’t be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
This is really sad. I don’t like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
This is failure on many levels including failure to recognize China as a threat. Mr. Biden, China must be held accountable. An investigation is a must! China must pay, what’s your policy?
Oh dear, Joe Biden wrong for moms?  I don’t think so. Most moms teach their kids to be honest and kind, listen to experts, be of service to others and respect women and people of color...like Joe does. Not like our liar-in-chief.
I’m wearing my Tweet less, Listen More Biden for President tee shirt.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
Biden is beyond tweeting. He can actually speak in real, understandable, words
Joe Biden doesn’t need to stay up all night incoherently tweeting. He’d rather sleep so he can READ HIS BRIEFINGS in the morning and keep America safe and informed.
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Is Biden allowed to run for president still?  Then, we are not Venezuela.
Can Biden still run for president?  Great!  Then we do not live in a dictatorship unlike Venezuela where the opposition cannot run in elections.
Following all too! Thank you Pati👏🏾💪🏾
Awesome group of resisters, followed all that were new to me. Thank you. Please follow back
That’s true, your right and I like your pony. but Biden is still a disappointment. And he looks like a puppet out of some weird political si-fi movie. You can’t disagree with that.
Yes, that's why the four polls showing Biden's leads increasing are in one tweet, and the two polls showing his leads decreasing are in the other. They do this every time, too -- look back.  I'm right, silly. :-)
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
This is a brilliant take. I bet this is where the VP search lands -- the candidate who would be best-positioned to insulate Biden (and Obama).
I wish republicans believed what leftist believe about Joe Biden and I wish leftists believed what republicans believe about Joe Biden.
Looking forward to "I once again vastly overestimated the President. I apologize and now acknowledge that the man is a fascist lunatic, and that Mr. Biden's prediction was not in fact "over the line," but tremendously prescient."  That's what you're writing, yes?
We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Time for a new revolution.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
Ohio elected Sherrod Brown. With the right message, Biden can win it.
Enough about Biden, let's talk Kanye.
I think Barr will try to arrest Susan Rice in September when "Dunham Report" (sp?) for unmasking Carter Page comes out; Barr will allege illegal spying. It will be a circus. Susan looks too depressed to me. Resting sad face. Biden has to pick Kamala.
Where is Biden's bishop? Why hasn't he excommunicated Biden? His failure to act while living off the donations of Catholics makes him as guilty as Biden.   Joe Biden promises to undo Trump-era pro-life policies if elected president | News | LifeSite -
Biden for president of the nursing home
100% ABSOLUTELY. Yang made it clear.  1. Biden is one term. So 2024 is an open election. 2. Biden will put Yang in his Cabinet.  This will help Andrew overcome his greatest weakness. Executive experience in DC. He'll see, How the sausage is made." 3. Yang will build connections.
If she was 7 years old he would be a Biden voter.
So you mean that we are going to get support for the "mesita" under Biden and support for fake parliamentary elections where the real opposition cannot run.
I don't know.  I think Maduro thinks Biden wins and is waiting for that.  Although he is humoring the EU because the fake opposition has been a bust (I'm not sure if you saw the story about the lack of candidates), he cannot promote some sort of rebellion among the "base."
Trump Isn’t Serious About Russia. But Neither Is Biden. - Noah Rothman, Commentary Magazine
I'd be really concerned, if I were the Amish, about Biden's pledge to make all new vehicles electric.
Look to the City of South Milwaukee when results come in. Clinton won it only by a point as it swung against her compared to Obama's 2012 margin and Evers only won by 2. Biden would like to get a 5 point win or better, while Trump would love to pull out a win here. 6/6
This is a region were Biden will want to continue to build on Clinton's 11 point lead here and get closer to Senator Baldwin's win of 15 points, while Trump would love to get close to only losing by around Walker's 7 point margin. 5/6
Fuck, hes gonna make me vote for Joe Biden.
This would mean that both the Dem president and VP candidates would be saps.   Biden Selects Aunt Jemima As Running Mate | The Babylon Bee -
We need Bernie, but corporate democrats won’t let us have him. So now the choices is nazi Russian agent end of democracy. Or Joe Biden so I will take him.
This feels like noise, from a pollster that infamously pulls low numbers for Biden. The NC shift is weird though given other pollsters showing NC being much more deadlocked and these other states far less close. Throw it into the averages I guess.
I don't think a soft touch will work.  What I've been arguing Biden should do is get tough on Maduro like the EU finally did.  Diplomatic/ economic pressure from EU, even weak sanctions, is worth a lot more than with Biden because Maduro expects them to bless his frauds.
Maduro isn't going to be willing to actually negotiate anything unless he feels cornered and he thinks Biden is going to throw them a lifeline.  I do hope that they can get more aid into the country but other than that, there is nothing to be done.
I agree that they need to be working out something but unfortunately things are on hold right now until the November elections in the US.  If Biden's advisors would repudiate elections, then things might open up but the useful idiots at WOLA are already pushing for the farces
Followed all. Thanks again Chloe.
Does Biden have any idea what an anarchist is?
If you saw Barr’s hearing and trump’s Covid presser today and are still hanging on who the VP pick is going to be before you decide who to vote for you’re an idiot...  I’m with you  ... Biden no matter who! #VoteBlueLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt Because it does.
Who said “Tell Vladimir that it will be easier working with him after the election” in that hot mic moment? Hint—Biden’s best friend. Who did nothing when Russia violated the INF treaty, who ridiculed Romney in the debates for saying that Russia was our greatest threat? Same!
Thank you Chloe!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica
As disappointed as I am I would rather have the Biden team calling the shots than the Trump team.
I’m a Warren dem and I am absolutely voting for Biden.  Whether she’s on the ticket or not.  This is some Russian Troll Farm bullshit right here.
Sure, but how much more wide of a net are the casting with Harris in terms of voters to the left of Biden?
Biden comes to power late Jan. Announces a national lock down in Feb. Second March in a row in quarantine.
Sorry but someone must have written this for Biden.
This is very much fluff.  I'd like to know what Biden's specific proposals are on Venezuela.  Does he consider Falcon and the "mesita" to be opposition?  Would he push for the opposition to organize and vote in favor of the "mesita's" candidates in parlimentary elections?
What if Biden has to use complete sentences?
The United States private sector will produce a vaccine or treatment. Obama, Biden or Clinton would’ve run all of this through the CDC and we would be so much further behind.
The dems has debates from January through the end of February. 18 people. The virus was mentioned zero times. Trump was taking measures he was mocked for by Biden and Pelosi
I knew it. I knew Biden was no better than trump when it comes to arresting protesters. It’s the same shit in different suits
aside from being biden boy and politics, i love finneas sm honestly
Why was your network afraid to air the Biden press conference live?
won’t even show Biden’s press conference live on now. They must fear the gaffs he is making.
Does Biden consider the "mesita" to be "opposition"?  Because I can never get a clear denunciation of those charlatans from left-leaning foreign policy types and IMO that is the key question on Venezuela.
Yep.  I just added a thread to this on my profile.  The issue with the Biden administration is that people like Rhodes and Rice would be in it and they are stupid enough to fall for Fal$on's BS lies.
The issue I have with Biden is I think that he'll throw Guaido under the bus and do some sort of deal with Maduro.  The administration would be subtle about it and promote the "mesita" and their non-existent electoral solution over Guaido.  Fal$on would get the DC meetings. 2/?
I see alot of Venezuelans for Joe Biden arguing that Biden will be better on Venezuela because he'll do a better job coordinating with the allies and getting EU sanctions.  This would be an outstanding argument if I felt that Biden was going to continue to support Guaido. 1/?
There’s plenty that would be inconvenient to remember about the Obama administration’s role in the Russia-collusion investigation, writes
It is perfectly safe to send kids back to school in Illinois, especially my area of Illinois.  I gave you the stats.  Why are you using the kids as a prop against Trump?  I expected more of Biden to be honest.
I want Biden to speak in favor of school reopenings and against virtual learning garbage.
Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’
Not a good look. What do we get for Biden? Nothing only that trump will be gone.
I love your comparison to shit and voting for Biden
This is not Biden's America.
We will never hear from Joe Biden again after his concession speech on November 3rd
will i ever meet biden boi
Agrees. Ironically, Biden's expectations are lower than Trump's for debate, so more upside here than people think for Joe.
IL-10: The Tenth is a light red district that includes parts of McHenry, Kane, Lake, and DuPage counties. After losing to Sean Casten in 2018, a Biden midterm allows Pete Roskam (R-Wheaton) to return to the Hill. 14/
Let's peek into a potential (and extremely unlikely) Illinoisan future. It is June 2021, and Joe Biden's vice president Tammy Duckworth has left a vacant Senate seat. Running off of her suburban appeal after defeating Randy Hultgren in the 14th district and her 1/
🙄. This is based on zero evidence. All evidence shows that the middle is falling behind Biden and Democrats. John Kasich was even discussed as being a speaker at the DNC! This tweet is nonsense.
When looking at the vote change map you can see how Evers did better almost everywhere in Kenosha County. Biden will want to either copy or improve upon Evers' performance. 4/5
Noam Chomsky makes the point That is bad as Biden is, he will still be easier to move to the left
Over 1 million Muslims have been locked up in Concentration camps for  simply practicing their religion in China and joe Biden and the left continually Defend and back China up this is very wrong  #MuslimLivesMatter #China #Trump2020Landslide
Let’s see what Joe Biden does when he loses?
What happens if Joe Biden refuses to accept election results?
omg good job biden boi!!!!!1
It is good that the Norwegians met with Guaido's group, not with the bozos of the mesita.  A more realistic fear than the EU or Biden endorsing Maduro outright is them endorsing Maduro's dingbat pawns as the real opposition.
If Joe Biden doesn’t pick a PoC as a running mate he will squander a unique historical opportunity. It’s time.
Under-discussed point Democratic governors in key states could help Biden. Less voter surpression in NC, PA, WI &amp; MI. And those states don’t need much to flip. If Cooper is winning by a wide margin easier to see Biden doing well in NC.
Apparently having questions about Biden's foreign policy views makes me a moron...  Shut up and drink the Koolaid.
I was hoping that Biden would gently repudiate Obama's sh*t foreign policy because he had always been more of a realist compared to the absolute naive garbage pumped out by Obama/ Rice like being "nice" would make bad guys like Iran and Cuba like us.. but guess not.
I could vote for neither...  How about that choice?  All I know is that J. Guaido and all the freedom fighters in Venezuela are screwed if Susan Rice gets to direct foreign policy just like they were screwed under Obama.  Sad because I thought better of Biden.
I'm mail-in voting, but it's Illinois, so something has REALLY hit the fan if Biden doesn't win here.
I cannot vote for Biden if she gets the nod.  That would suggest an endorsement of Obama's worst foreign policy initiatives - Cuba "thaw," Iran deal, etc.
The Lincoln Project wants to convince GOPers to vote for Biden by puffing the architect of Obama sh*tty foreign policy as VP for some reason.
Why?  She was horrible as Obama's NSA.  Do you really want bad deals like sucking up to the Castros to be on the table during Biden's presidency?
The issue is that Trump is capricious and changes his whims.  In this regard, Biden would be better.  The issue with Biden is his unwillingness to play "bad cop" and press for a solution.
The federal government doesn’t fund the police.
The best part is that the people standing around aren knocked over...just the wall
So you are telling me that if I vote for Biden, the sanctions are going to be stronger and the troops are going to be staged in Colombia ready for an invasion?  Because that isn't the vibe I am getting.
Joe Biden will never be heard from again after his concession speech
The difference between Trump and Biden is one of them knows what he doesn’t know and what he should hand off to others.. The other is a fucking moron ( Credit to Tillerson)
Whew.. I was concerned Biden would defund police.. Guess I will switch my vote back to Biden.. PS only Trumpsters believe that shit
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You do realize Biden shitting himself is a very real possibility?
Biden still hasn’t said Dickie mcGeezaks about what happened in Portland Kyle Kulinski
#CognitivelyThere can Biden say: ” Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV?” He doesn't need to. He's busy with plans to clean up Trump’s mess and end Corona Virus.
Twitter buzz or hot takes don’t translate into votes - Biden under-estimated &amp; the left hasn’t processed why they lost
A Joe Biden cabinet would be center right not left wing
Biden would have the same as Barack Obama’s administration. That wasn’t a left wing progressive administration. What kind of Supreme Court picks would we get from the guy who voted for Clarence Thomas?
Joe Biden wanted a police bill of rights in the 1990’s do you think he’s changed
He can beat Biden off? Ewww.
Virtual phone banking. Donated to Biden. Visibility with bumper sticker and Biden Tee Shirt.
How do we know Joe Biden would do the opposite?
It seems like Mesa, who seems like the "Joe Biden" of Bolivia is going to win in a walk (but things can easily change.)  People want boring, adult centrism.
...what on earth are you talking about? What candidate? Joe Biden? A person widely considered a rapist and racist among the progressive movement?
Yup. Plus Operation Overtake Blue Cities and things of that nature.  Goal would be to make Biden so busy on Day One that he has to spend 48 hours straight signing EOs to undue the EOs that Trump signed. SCOTUS would be busy, Congress wouldn't do much, it will be nuts.
Look at these people. Biden voters. Imagine aligning with them. Jfc.
Dukakis was good man but had the magnetism of an old shoe. Biden far more charismatic, likable, fun, despite age. And perfect antidote to Trump. Much better story.
Biden will be 46, and the USA will be Germany '46.
This is from tonight. All Biden voters.   Pretty easy decision for most.
Mr. Biden, what’s your policy on China?  Your son worked for China for several years, how can you be tough on China? China did not roll out the red carpet for president Obama. China wants you to win because the words are you can be bought with a price. Please show a strong policy
Biden voters
Not sure this changes anything. Talk to voters. Highlight Trump’s failures; Biden’s compassion. Win at the ballot box-Priorities. If  wants to skip the inauguration, so be it. First Lady Jill Biden can toss his sorry ass onto #BlackLivesMatterPlaza . Bye, Felicia.
All I know is he supports Joe Biden and he has since the primary started
What sane person would vote for Trump in 20.  If they despise Biden so much then bounce Trump for a stable mature Republican alternative.
Karen bass s gonna be VP.
My smart 6 year-old’s got a message for Biden that he should hear! #voteforchange #voteblue2020 #biden2020 #notmypresident #viral  Skokie, Illinois
Who is the BOOGEYMAN after all destruction in many, many American cities? Off cause Libmob,  BLM, ANTIFA Demparty   But Left media, MSM, Biden pushing narrative the BOOGEYMAN is Trump.  What is your thoughts?
The NBA needs to cut ties with China. It’ll keep Biden out of the White House and fannies out of the seats.
So why is it OK to trash her and put her credibility and past under a microscope, but take everything Biden says at face value? He has hit on Senate staff members in the pasta s well. There have been witnesses to his come ons DAYS after his late wife's death.
Biden claimed his late wife and son were hit by a drunk driver. The driver was NOT drunk and the accident had been his wife's fault. He lied about getting arrested with Mandela. Wrote the racist crime bill and lied about that. Days ago cribbed Jay Inslee's green bill as his own.
And I would add, if we can question Reade's credibility, we should rightfully question Biden's as well. This man has made a career of lying, deceit and plagiarizing. 1978 he plagiarized a speech by UK Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. He lied about his wife's fatal accident.
If you defend joe biden you are a racist
You established something in your head. If you support Joe Biden you are a racist. If you say any different you are a racist.
And they’re a large donor to Biden’s campaign as well as Comcast
When you look at who is voting for Biden the choice becomes clear.
I personally don't like Trump but have issues with Biden as well.
I'm going to vote for neither Biden nor Trump to be honest.  At least that is how I am leaning.  But I do think the doomers will STFU if Biden is president.
This, IMO, is one of the best reasons to vote for Biden.  The hysteria in the US seems to be wrapped up in the cult of "Orange Man Bad."  Maybe if Biden wins things calm down and we put on our big kid pants.  The only issue is that Biden has been acting as such a scold as of late
As someone who has friends who lived in an actual dictatorship, Venezuela, I find this offensive.  You will be able to vote for Biden in November.
I agree. And also what about the idiocy of claiming that if you won't vote Biden you're helping Trump? So I tell em, if I don't vote Trump, I'm helping Biden so leave me alone!
Shut the front door!  Well, Biden does love baseball, and I can forgive him being a Phillies fan instead of Cubs.
Cancel Biden then.
Make excuses for Biden’s fascism because he’s a Democrat. As they did for Clinton and especially for Obama, a Black Democrat. Obama bombed seven countries and was even harsher on whistle blowers than Trump. Also deported more people than Trump. But he’s Team Blue so...all good.
I think the real PTB (ie the titans of Wall St) are disenchanted with his instability and are confident Biden will deliver more $$$ in the way of military engagement. So Trump is out and Biden is in. Not for any humanitarian objectives though. Trump has ceased to be profitable.
The point of the post is that the protests in the videos are happening right now, DURING Trump's presidency, while Trump's campaign team tries to spin it like it's a fictional dystopia that only becomes real if Biden wins
Perhaps Congress will be doing the legislating in a Biden administration?
The Biden campaign spent all of their funds on snack provisions for the Biden Basement.
Impeach him again.  There's no limit on how many times a president can be impeached.  Don't take Biden winning for granted.  Congress needs to assume trump will win in November and impeach now.
While Biden gets inaugurated, trump is dragged by his hair kicking &amp; screaming.
I agree with Joe Biden.
Both Barak Obama and Joe Biden did a terrific job during their administration. They treated everyone with dignity, respect and compassion. Your claim to fame is being able to say person, man, woman, camera, tv. Moron.
Watch it, compare it to what we have today and for the love of God vote for Biden, no excuses folks!
This is Trending Now #personwomanmancameratv
All I want Biden to say in response to that question is, "How did Mnuchin pay for the $500 billion that was given away to corporate interests he won't disclose to the public? How did he pay for lining the pockets of the already grotesquely wealthy?"
I will infuriate people when I say this. I’d like to see Trump re-elected with the Aden’s winning the Senate. Then they could torture him every day of his life. Investigations. Reimpeachment. Kick him out. Impeach his judges. NONE of which Biden would do.
Biden voter.
I bet he didn’t either, there is nothing he won’t lie about.
Here you go: Trump touts mental fitness, says Biden 'obligated' to take a cognitive test  via
I believe Mr Biden is the first anti- American presidential candidate.
There was a time when Biden wouldn't have even been considered because of his cognitive skills. Woodrow Wilson wanted a third term but, the word was Getting out about his issues after his stroke.
Can’t wait to see Joe Biden debate trump.I think Biden supporting the BLM Marxist movement will hurt him. He's already demonized &amp; villified Law Enforcement; plus his reputation with Small Business Owner's is not so great also. We will see. Biden sure has HollyWood, Sport's Athletes, &amp; the Liberal Media in his corner!!
I’m just waiting for Biden to do the smart thing.  I do have some nurse overtime 💰💰💰 to donate.  Until then I’ll wait.
Never saw one for Biden attacking trump! Hmm
Had Bernie supported reparations to American descendants of slavery during his campaign he might be the nominee right now instead of Biden.
Biden too.
I remember the surprise on Biden’s face when Obama announced Joe was the recipient of that medal. Glory days, before the orange guy wrecked this country to save repeatedly save his ego. #vote
We've got another two more weeks of this garbage. Biden won't announce until the weekend before the convention.
Five of the last 14 VPs have gone on to serve as POTUS, five more ran unsuccessfully, and Dick Cheney was so humble he picked himself as GWB’s running mate. Biden has emphasized he needs someone who can step in from day one if needed; shouldn’t he want someone who wants the job?
A literal cultist is on Biden's VP shortlist.
Yikes?  A cultist is on Biden's short list?
I wanted Joe Biden to be the New President of the United States Of America.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😀😀🙂🙂☮️☮️💟💟
Biden doesn't want to, we can tell you that.
I just wish Biden would get it done.  Getting really sick of horse-race veep coverage.  Though I guess if the media must do obnoxious horse race coverage, this is better than the alternative.
If Biden has decided on whom he is picking, he needs to announce ASAP. This has been a dumpster fire of a process.
Absolutely. Biden will definitely have his work cut out for him when he beats Trump in the election and is then tasked with cleaning up the mess that Trump and his regime' have turned our country into.
This implies that you know better than Biden which candidate will produce the most excitement. So tell us, who will that be?
Where are you getting that stat? Biden is up in nearly every poll including Fox News.
If I wasn’t voting for Joe Biden  I wouldn’t be wishing you a Happy Birthday!
Joe Biden is pitiful.  I'm still going to vote for him, but the man can't even pick his own vice president.  He keeps putting it off.  How's he going to deal with a crisis if he can't even pick his own vice president?
Biden would lose the election if Trump announced a medicare for all plan. Just keeping it real.
Our first debate question comes from Jim H in Bloomingdale, and he asks, “what is the best CD ever and why is it AC/DC back in Black?”  Biden: “where r my keys”  Trump: *eye roll*
Dead... like Biden, lol
..this wording leads to a possibility of the far less intelligent doing something such as ingesting lysol. Tell me that's wrong? Btw I would say the same thing about Biden with the same words because some people can't process info correctly.
Thanks mr Biden
Poor Biden - he’s donezo.  LMMFAO
Demming's WAD A COP.  . Duckworth ( My Senator) Doesn't have the experience... . Biden's not squeaky clean either. . Stop the bull shit man... . Nobody's a saint.
mr biden sir please just let her interview mindy kaling or something in peace
BIG MEN DO BIG THINGS...
Watching now and am loving your guests. When Biden wins I hope he convinces Al to take a cabinet position.
If Biden wins this year wait until January when the narrative  will be "this is the new normal. Deal with it." Everything will open again.
biden's VP search has been so funny dude. just utterly incompetent in every respect. there's the cop lady who put single moms in jail, there was the minnesota lady who verbally abuses panera staff, and now we got the church of scientology lady who has an e-meter in her purse
Who is the lesser of two evils #Politics #Election2020 #Biden #trump
Pay no attention 2 Trump trying 2 instill fear in you about postponing the election or not accepting the results of the election, hence Biden becomes President.  By law, if the election isn’t decided by Jan. 20, 2021, Nancy Pelosi becomes president.  Either way, normalcy returns.
Blocked.
Pretty sure Jill’s first choice wasn’t Joe Biden.

What in the fck is Biden going to do that he didn't do the last 40 plus years? Trump did more in 4 years than Biden ever has. Biden is a true racist, research him better all of you young people, you have no clue.
Did Dodd leak this too? Because it is clear that Biden doesn't give a damn about leaks!  Same authors for the other Politico articles.
BRUTAL: Latest Biden GAFFE Shows His Worsening Decline  via
Is Biden going to announce Warren as his VP on this fundraising video thing???
Biden held rallies. Obama didn’t leave any PPE stockpiles, and had no national testing strategy despite H1N1.
Again, not a supporter, but I heard this kind of rederick last time around. It may be wise for Biden to get those swing state voters to think about if Trump made good on his promises to them...and to not select a socialist running mate.
Timing played a crucial role here, as well as the fact that Biden received pretty much zero critical coverage after Super Tuesday.
Wouldn’t the more effective strategy be to attack Biden and undermine his legitimacy by launching non-stop investigations starting now? And arguing it’s important to retain the Senate so that Biden can’t get any appointments through?

He won't take the debate stage v. Biden. He doesn't have to as of right now.
his argument on that is irrefutable, in my view. its something you do 15 minutes every two years, and trump is dedicated to ecological suicide, whereas Biden is only apathetic. the real work is not voting for pres, its activism. do you differ
Biden,,LOL! CCP love your choice
They would text me all the time. I finally had to tell them to stop texts lol Fuck off Biden people 😒
It's way less than half. The popular vote even said that in 2016. Nah, Biden will win then we'll own your ass while listening to you whine for 8 years.
That eulogy was disgusting.  He made it a campaign rally for Biden.  Quite classless
LIKE N SHIT......
Inane comments but no matter who Biden chooses there’ll be lots of misogyny.
I can't find who started the org but the dude who tweeted that dumbass exchange about his settle for biden shirt gave to Amy McGrath in 2019 despite living in Michigan. So he's def being disingenuous
LIKE N SHIT
Put your big boy and girl pants on and go vote.  Dems never let a crisis go to waste.  Now you'll have a valid reason to cry election interference.  Especially China because they love Biden.  If you thought FB posts from Russia were the cause last time, wait until November.
You mean because he’s the candidate not actively trying to eliminate their jobs? The fuck you think they’re gonna do? Like they have time to open millions of ballots, see which ones are for Trump, shred them, seal back up the ones for Biden, then send them on their way?
TESTING 1, 2...TESTING 1, 2
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Obama is putting the "Sleepy Joe" as candidate to rule himself and Biden is just to play as being President. This is the plan.

Was just thinking about that last night. Biden in power, young Dems disillusionment,
SOLUTION ...MAGA DONE RIGHT
their willingness to accept and welcome GWB before ever considering merely tolerating Bernie Sanders says everything we need to know about why they’re so fanatical about a Biden presidency.
I’m not a Democrat, and it doesn’t matter to me who Biden picks for VP. The only thing that matters is that Trump loses. But I like  I think Biden/Harris would be a dynamite ticket. Seems crazy to me that so many supposed “friends of Biden” are taking shots at her.
i would vote for JOE BIDEN if he was KANYE WEST
Definitely, &amp; intelligent people can decipher this ploy. Regardless of what he claims in the end, I’ll be relieved &amp; thankful when he’s gone. He’s been an embarrassment, the antithesis of what a POTUS should be &amp; stand for. Although I hope it’s Biden, anyone’s better than Trump.
Biden should pick Hillary Clinton for VP
It could have been easy. Biden picks someone without any vetting leaks. Now, the vetting process will stain the VP nominee regardless whom it is. If the nominee becomes Vice President and possibly President, there will be some issues noted in her selection in the history books.
Biden's running mate announcement pushed back, likely will not come next week
😜😃😷😀🤪...LIKE N SHIT AGAIN
#1 is going to be very important. Biden will be the oldest elected president. If something happens to him the foreign policy issues will still need to be in capable hands.
Alyssa, have you thought of making a scented candle that smells like your vagina?  Joe Biden isn't the only one that wants to sniff you.  You could donate all the profits to Planned Parenthood.  Just an idea.
You know what's great? EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE WOMEN WOULD BE FABULOUS. Let's let Biden make his decision then support it 100% confident that many of the women mentioned will be members of a fantastic Cabinet, team of Advisers and Congress.  #RidinWithBiden #DNC
Call me greedy, but this is still 3-4 points lower than will have me feeling comfortable about Biden’s chances.

I'm in. Are you behind this? Because I am. Accepting and adopting proposals from progressives, from climate fighters. Push our leaders, no matter who, to help us improve.
Not if his replacement is Biden, whose entire record suggests he'll work just as diligently to harrass minority communites and expand genocidal empire abroad
Biden's vetting team is terrible.
Shocked, frankly, that Biden and his pals are old white dudes.
That is exactly the point. Picking Kamala won't cause anyone  to NOT vote for Biden and if it does, they weren't voting for Biden to begin with.
Is he talking about a different Joe Biden?
LIKE N SHIT...U KNOW THE DEAL😷😷🤪😷🤪
NEW WATCHDOG.......
Wondering how many law obiding citizens will be afraid to vote for Trump to avoid the violence that might follow. Progressive Democrats accomplished their goal of herding the Americans into the Biden corner by projecting riots and violence against them for voting their consience.
I mean Biden has a long crappy record that can easily be criticized.
Quite frankly, Rep Clyburn was much more in tune with the base that brought Biden the nomination and his thoughts on this should matter a whole lot more.
There is a push by some people for Biden not to select Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate because she have presidential aspirations and that she might not be loyal. My question is have they ever push to disqualify a man because of presidential aspirations?
Florida Teen ‘Mastermind' Among 3 Charged in Massive Twitter Hack.

President Biden, would you please snatch our precious Medal of Freedom from off of Rash Flimball's neck so we can wash the shit stain from it's history?!?!?🤗
ALL MUST GO...
Lifelong native deep in the heart of Progressiveland, can attest that Dor has it right. The Sandersnistas are neutered right now because of how RVAT have grown and become more vocal. If that holds through November, Biden can win _and_ can then govern from the center-left.
Kamala is our VP! No one has worked harder, nonstop, addressing all the inequality and corruption with Our Constitution, from this current Administration. She suspended her campaign and went into Overdrive for Biden! Crown Our Queen, Joe!
Kamala has a lot of support on Twitter that’s for sure. If Biden were considering men (which he’s not), I think the most winning ticket is Biden/ Buttigieg. Seriously.
Only mistake Biden can make with his VP pick is elevating an unknown and concentrating national attention on her in an intense public vetting process. Has to be Warren or Harris, or maaaaaaybe Duckworth. Really though he should just go with Warren
I love The Lincoln Project, but ads about Trump's health are wrong and they remind people that Biden is older than Trump.
This view is ignoring the fact that we have a duopoly, and the only way to remedy this is with something like #RankedChoiceVoting.  Vote for Biden now.   Support #RankedChoiceVoting in the meantime.  And be able to vote your conscience in the future.
Bernie Bros say no to Biden   I still think they remove him on or near their Convention,   They can't trot this dude out there, there's no way your gonna tell me Joe Biden is gonna beat Trump   NOT A CHANCE..   (TRUMP 2020) 🇺🇸 MAGA 🇺🇸 KAG 👍
I’m really not ready for Biden to announce his VP tomorrow, especially if it’s who Politico accidentally leaked the other day... I can’t do it
Lots of signs in Michigan --  Biden and Trump

Ask Rep Clyburn.  He’s more in touch with the Dem base that delivered Biden.

Maybe Biden just shouldn't pick a vice president.

The audacity! They claim that things will be so bad under Biden while ignoring the fire their leader started and continues to ignore...I’ve not seen anything like this. Ever.
People are reading it wrong, as in 72% of Biden’s votes will come by mail. It’s 72% of mail in voters will vote Biden.
i really perceived it as the gold watch for biden, and that HRC was next in line
right, but like... was the selection of biden meant to be obama choosing an heir apparent?  at the time i thought it was more "reassure moderate white democrats/buff foreign policy credentials"  this election the VP slot absolutely should be used to designate an heir apparent tho
Biden is not the guy to throw curve balls. if there's an obvious choice, he makes the obvious choice.
This is not satire. This is a “grassroots organization” with a “mission to (begrudgingly) put Joe in the White House.” And it’s no surprise that there is little enthusiasm for Joe “shoot them in the leg” Biden.  On…
Harris is conventionally qualified for president, she and Biden get along, she's Black,and she was vetted in the presidential nomination contest. Also her seat is really straightforwardly safe. and she's the right age. She's just the most obvious choice.
It's very sad not being a pedophile alone makes you the best presidential candidate. That being said I'd still vote yeezus over biden
President Biden, would you please, early in your Administration, get our medal back from Rash Flimball so we can scrub the shit stain off of it?!?!?🤗
Biden is smarter than this, my guess is it's all planted bullshit from the left and right horseshoe of idiocy.
Harris is the more conventionally qualified choice. Just doubt Biden will buck that.
When Biden tanks the economy, you mean?  Why wait? You've got that now.

Joe Biden ran in 2016 and lost!
I definitely will be voting for #Biden because my future and my children’s futures depend on it!

Please do this Biden.  It would rule.
biden's going to pick Harris like he signaled he was going to do from the beginning.

I am.  The top of the ticket diesnt matter in a dark blue state so I'm ignoring it until Biden or anyone 70 or above  isn't on it.
Harris rubbed Jill Biden the wrong way.  This was AFTER Biden apologized for his Eastland Dog whistle.
I don't really care who Biden's VP choice is as long as he chooses someone who is qualified. He should not drag this out given because the process is a dumpster fire.   Given the events of this week, I think will be Rice. Rice is "simpatico" with Biden

Both Harris and Rice would probably be fine Presidents if Biden kicks it, I'm just saying I can see a good faith argument for why it's desirable to have a VP that won't shift into campaign mode in 2022 and won't plan on being prez in 2024.

Biden is already Center enough,
only voting for Biden so I can stop reading the same tweet every other week:

Obama's call to end the filibuster reminds me a lot of when Biden came out in favor of same-sex marriage in 2012. Obama framing this around voting rights gives Biden the cover to support it down the line without spending too much political capital on it.
I think the list of crimes by Trump and his cronies is far longer and better documented than anything Nixon and company did. Can you imagine a report that Trump hired people to break in to Biden’s office being a story for more than day or two?

Biden VP -  is a good choice  and  are needed to remain In the senate.   also a good choice. But my choice  I can’t find a single reason I would not want her as Madam Vice President.
They also say Biden's years-long working relationship with Rice is not to be underestimated, particularly given how he has emphasized wanting a partner who is "simpatico with me."

Biden has refused to commit to defunding the police, he as only committed to police reform
One Democratic aide with knowledge of the search process offered this blunt observation: "Biden allies are laying the groundwork for the vice president to have a reason to not choose her."

“Don’t split the vote” &amp; “you’ll give us trump if you don’t vote Biden” is petty bourgeois propaganda That has been ingrained in us since birth! ELECTORALISM IS INHERENTLY BOURGEOIS. a protest vote is more meaningful than Biden.

We don’t have elections in the US. We have coronations. The Democratic Party doesn’t even try to hide their corruption anymore. Somehow, people will STILL believe Joe Biden has their best interest in mind. He was *selected* not elected, and that’s why he will never get my vote.
more viewers than #biden gets from his basement!
Facts don't matter to Darcy. Agendas (even unfounded ones) and talking points are all that matter. And the "I'm voting Biden" rhetoric is just laughable.
Today during the #covidhearing America just saw on how left-leaning #Fauci is. Jordan asked him a simple yes or no questions about the protests and could they contribute to the #COVID19 , and he just avoided the question. Fauci might as well put a BIDEN 2020 on his car.
Hey  - can you pause from your pivot to fascist boot-licking to comment on this article you wrote 3 months ago?
I'm not sure. Thinking about what Biden wants in a VP, Rice fits the bill. I don't see a reason for people to trash Harris if she is the pick.   I just want Biden to announce... :(
Biden is +15 above, but Dems can still use all its expertise and screw up this one too.

You embarrass your own political understanding any time you describe what Biden says as "far left." Please, at the very least, try to make your criticism accurate.
NEUTRALIZE A POTENTIAL BIDEN ATTACK!
It has been reported that Clyburn supports Harris as VP. That has significant weight.   Clyburn has said that Biden will make the pick, it is possible that Clyburn is now publicly lobbying for Harris, but knows Rice is the likely pick.
Answer: It wouldn’t. They were both elected in the same ticket. Biden can’t just fire his VP.   After all, we don’t live in a feudalistic society where the next in line murders the person in charge just to obtain power.
3. Ambition ≠ Disloyalty  So Senator Harris has ambition. She wants to get things done. How would her ambition cause her to be disloyal to Biden?
The first morning we wake up and Joe Biden is the President of the United States we can take a breather for a moment ☺️
I don’t believe Joe Biden understands just how infuriating this nonsense is for women, Black women in particular. He may not say anything until he announces (a mistake in my opinion, should have BEEN addressed) when he does, he MUST repudiate all of this in no uncertain terms.Seriously, the “too ambitious to be VP” stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
I'm arguing that defeating trump should come first and people shouldn't support trump, just because Biden doesn't rise to their extreme progressive agenda
This is really sad. I don’t like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Corruption is open and visible, but Democrat voters do't seem to catch on?  Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries, during Biden's 1st five yrs as VP?  Five of those trips to China.  No trips to Ukraine Energy Co. who paid him 1M a yr, to "not show up?"

I'll still vote for progressive candidates in Dem primaries and I'll likely begrudgingly vote for Biden but honestly it's so damn frustrating.

Sorry but someone must have written this for Biden.
There isn't anyone from a swing state who could provide what he needed. I'm almost positive this won't be an all white ticket. So no Warren. I'd love susan rice but she has baggage. And I promise you Biden knows who got him thru the primaries so it will probably be a black woman.

There is no reason to have remorse.  This is the very reason she’s a strong candidate.  Biden isn’t going to want someone who backtracks.  He wants someone with a spine who stands by her words.
I’m 100% certain Biden heard what Kamala said to him on the debate stage and she still made his short list of VPs.   This is politics. He’s not looking for a VP who is going to stand next to him and just nod and smile.  Wake up, people!
Aging and diminished joe Biden. Lolz. Have you people seen or listened to trump?
How to take seriously an article that calls Joe Biden who is clearly in much better shape than trump aging and diminished.
And they are coming for the suburbs.  Law introduced by Obama &amp; Biden, but POTUS refused to enforce.  Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, or AFFH.  Using this law as and add-on to HUD, O'Bidens plan to invade suburbs. Take over local Government of towns, cities and burrows.
refuse to account, will be denied state &amp; Fed assistance, like education and roads.  Feds will force communities to build multi dwelling, low income buildings, at your expense.  They will outlaw single family homes as White privilege.  This is Socialism!  This is Biden's plan.
Rice might make a better match with Biden in office, the winning is going to be difficult. W/ all the republican tricks, trump could lose the popular vote by 30 points and still win the election. Thus the best campaign should be almost the entire consideration
Biden will never do an interview unless he gets all questions first
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made max donation to Socialist.Marxist/Democrat Joe Biden?  No surprise.  NBA depends on China for a billion fans &amp; cheap merchandise.  Merchandise produced by slave labor, minority group Uyghurs.  Ironic,BLM supports slave labor?  Joe supports China.
Will Hillary replace Biden.  #Biden2020 #hillary #Trump2020
Socialist/Marxist/Democrats want to overthrow our Republic and Capitalism, for Socialism &amp; Marxism.  NBA Teams and merchandise, heavily invested in CHINA.  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, just  made max donation to O'Biden.  Hunter Biden made 411 trips, to 29 foreign countries,
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
BIDEN CALLED THIS A MOVEMENT AND ASKED, "WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?!"   i don't think he gets it
#FACTCHECK  The Committee to Defend #realDonaldTrump has been running a misleading #Facebook ad campaign targeting older voters in #NorthCarolina that twists #Biden words to brand him a #racist.   The ad inaccurately claims that Biden praised KKK members
Biden would have saved over 146,000 American lives.
My smart 6 year-old’s got a message for Biden that he should hear! #voteforchange #voteblue2020 #biden2020 #notmypresident #viral  Skokie, Illinois
Maybe 30-32% Don't get so excited.  These people will return to their flawed core beliefs at a moments notice when they are reminded that nothing else matters except "all the dead babies". Biden and all the Dems need to get ahead of this issue and speak compassionately to it.
While Biden gets inaugurated, trump is dragged by his hair kicking &amp; screaming.
Hunter Biden made 411 trips to 29 foreign countries. in the 1st 5 yrs of Joes's VP.  Why?  Five of these trips were to China, none to Ukraine, who pasy Hunter 1m a yr, to not show up?  Hunter took1.5b from China, invested China in dual US technology; civilian &amp; military use?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
This will happen in America, if we don't stop Democrats from buying the power of the Presidency.  Joe Biden promises free HC, maintenance man, nurse &amp; therapist for seniors?  Free childcare, free college, free housing?  Gov has no money, it does not take from taxpayers, or PRINT!
This is Trumps America right now. Not Biden. This man is a disaster.
Can’t wait to see Joe Biden debate trump.Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
What funeral? The divisive Obama Biden political rally?!
The military will not follow his orders. Just swear Biden in, take the nuke suitcase away and govern at camp David. trump will find that an empty White House will become boring and he’ll eventually move out. The secret service for Biden can remove trump also.
We are so weak in the worlds eyes now. Biden will have to MAGA
More than half of them don't want him reelected, and he loses more support in congress and in the senate each day. There's no surprise that the Lincoln project is doing so well and gaining so much revenue and turning moderate Republicans over to Biden.
a Biden/Harris ticket would be detrimental to all the progress made on criminal justice reform
Told you, they will pick a far left vice president and if Biden wins he will be declared incompetant and the Vice Pres will take over where Vp had zero chance if running as pres
Joe Biden? Is that you???
Just saw a commercial for  where that #idiot  was making fun of Trump for stumbling over his words... just wondering if you've ever heard Biden talk? #Trump2020
Joe Biden is going to be the President of the nursing home... no doubt.
Joe Biden being president from a Trans Am seems like it would cause Amy Carter’s Shoe’s to explode in orgasmic joy.  cc:
Trumps presidency has cost us 150,000 American lives plus raising the deficit to world record highs along with record unemployment. How could Biden possibly make it worse than Trump?
What has Obama and Biden done for blacks in their 8 years, tell me?
I think you want to blame the real cause, China, for all these desths, not Trump. If Biden was President the desths would be 1,000 times higher!
AG Barr is just slowly exposing the most corrupted administration in the history of the USA.  The Obama Biden administration! No wonder that the Democrats hate him.  But nobody is above the law! Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... Democrats Hypocrites!
Biden was stumbling through his 1 hour press conference.
I'll give you quick update.               Barr was asked to speak in front of Congress ..but when asked questions..he wasn't allowed to answer.  Biden came out of the basement and said he now realizes that he can get watched on TV by other states.
trump is making you guys surveilling US citizens as I tweet. I trust Biden over the trump syndicate.
Biden MAGA!!!! Please!!!
Yup but at least it’s not bull from Biden.
jpwtweets Biden Is Right. Pay for Home Health Workers Is Paltry.  jpwtweets
Biden had a Stroke
The choice is stark. The most prolific liar, the most corrupt and inept POTUS In History or a very competent, honest and caring politician in Biden.
And all 19 believe Biden vs none who believe anything Trump says.
Biden had a Stroke recently!
Still looking for your stories on Biden hiding and refusing to do interviews. #EnemyOfThePeople
I thought the same thing. But Biden actually had a STROKE!
Biden had a Stroke
If Biden wins he would be a hero on CNN
Over a thousand a day of us are dying from Trumps complete mismanagement of the Trump Corona Virus. Biden would be a tremendous improvement.
And Trump begged foreign leaders to manufacture dirt on Biden. Trump was impeached for it.
If they have any sense at all they will vote Biden. Trump is killing over 145,000 from the Trump Corona Virus so far. Trump has done way more wrong than right.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You had a Stroke Biden.  The jig is up man. YOU HAD A STROKE. YOU HAD A STROKE!
Just saw the first Biden ad. Wow. So full of shit. Dems has 4 years and wasted it.
It’s a bot that replies to all Trump and Biden tweets. Just block and move on, it’s harmless
Maybe you take votes away from Biden and because of that we get another 4 years of Donnie. It’s probably your end game, tbh. Doesn’t make you any more relevant though, sorry pal.
Agreed.  Joe Biden is a poor unfortunate soul.  Well said!
What a nonsense!  It's very good that Joe Biden won't be the President and the puppet of the left mob in the White House! Hard to get a worse candidate than Hillary Clinton, but Joe Biden is even much worse than her.
Wrong! Trump is right! I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message.
In NH, the key will be if Sununu gets through and wins a 3rd term as Governor as Biden blows Trump out for President.  If he does, he holds all the cards. He could decide to take a shot at the White House lesving the door open for Ayotte-Hassan II.....
Hello. Thanks for the tweet. Here's the rationale. If Biden blows Trump out by 10+, it would mark the biggest landslide by a Dem in a Pres. Election since LBJ over Goldwater in '64 (60-39). 2 yrs. later Republicans had a huge year....
That bottom left photo is clearly photoshopped, which is obvious if you just google "crying flute girl". This is the origin of that shot. That person is Stephanie Carter, who has spoken out about people misusing the photo to wrongly attack Biden.
Another tweet to promote Trump by Maggie! Disgraceful! I never send Biden or Obama on her account! I could be wrong !
It's surreal to think the President's former personal attorney, who's now reportedly under federal investigation, would team up with a crew of Kremlin-connected Ukrainians with a record of spreading conspiracy theories. Yet, somehow, that's what's going on
The left mob has exposed themselves totally! I can't imagine a normal family who will vote for Joe Biden, who will be completely controlled by the left mob!
Are the rumors true that the Obama administration helped support the Wuhan lab with tons of taxpayer money where without our support they could not create this bio weapon and turn it against us. Hmmm Biden family has strong ties with China also!!! Strange!
Who cares. Regular citizen when he said that. Biden was in politics. Besides, what groupie doesnt want a billionaire to grab them by the pussy. I’ll wait!!!!!
White, female, suburban wife here...my fellow white, females, suburban wife friends think you are a nut job. We welcome Biden. My previously republican husband (who voted for you) also welcomes Biden. He feels sorry for you and wants someone with character and integrity. #seeya
Biden is going to usurp Pinky and the Brain.
You’re destroying everything now. Biden will have his hands full rebuilding to MAGA.
Biden don't even remember his name ha ha ha
Never get comfortable, act as if Biden is losing by 14 points.
Honestly it’s easier just to block, he does it with both Trump and Biden and somehow always winds up on top of the comments
Biden supporters are looking for something to destroy, burn or to loot.  Maybe I have missed something...
#GoJoe This is good-   Biden HQ: We know you've been waiting for it -- Joe and President Obama's full conversation is finally here!  Don't miss a minute of 44 and 46's in-person chat. Watch the full video:
If Hillary Clinton is more qualified to be the President, so why she is not running the 2020 election??? What has changed? Hahahahahahahahahahahaha... After another 4 years of Trump's Presidency the left would say again that Joe Biden was more qualified.  Hahahahahahahahahahaha..Remember when Capriles went running to Elliot Abrams with the proposal that the Americans appoint him President of Venezuela and then Abrams said no.  Maybe his buddy Leo Martinez told him that he'd have better luck under Biden which is why he won't STFU.
She fights the good fight everyday!! Vote Biden so she can walk away when she wants to.  #VoteBlueForRBG
Seriously, the “too ambitious to be VP” stuff is mind boggling. Biden is going to be 78. Never said anything about a second term. Age is a huge factor for the VP. Whoever he chooses is the odds on favorite to be the front runner in 2024.
You make a good point, but only if we survive the next 6 months as a country.  50/50?  This is gonna get ugly, folks.  Barr is going to arrest Susan Rice (which is why she can't be VP). Possibly Biden. Trump still hasn't used a nuke.  Shit's gonna get dark. Not hyperbole, either.
Biden can kiss Florida goodbye if he picks Karen Bass.
It will be the party to end all parties. Living in Chicago, I remember how excited I was and the feelings of pride I had when President Obama won in 2008, it'll be rivaled by the feeling I'll have when we have President Biden!!
It's artificial. They're only making these leaks to the media to make Biden look like he's not the same old white guy Dem when he does what the establishment wants in selecting Harris. It's sleazier than good ole fashioned crotchety misogyny.
These leaks feel like they're designed to make Biden seem more independent and "with the times" when he makes the trashy establishment choice in Harris. Seems very artificial.
Biden and his allies should really drop the whole he'll never meet with Maduro line if he chooses tankie, Karen Bass, as VP.  Or is he just being literal with this because he'll just send VP Bass down to Caracas for a "We Love Maduro" pep rally.
It's interesting because it seems like Trump is going hard after the south Florida Latinos, who do appreciate his tough line on Cuba/ Venezuela and don't particularly trust Biden.
Karen Bass?  Really?  Biden is trying to actively lose Florida if he picks Castro-lover for VP.  At least he has some pictures of himself with Liliana Tintori which he can hide behind when it comes to Maduro/ Castro.  Not sure what he can do with Tankie Lady on the ticket.
Believe me that the Cuban and Venezuelan communities in Florida hate Susan Rice as well because she is way more connected to the Obama policies on Cuba/ Venezuela that they despise than Biden who can at least point to advocating for important political prisoners in Venezuela.
Heaven forbid a VP run for president....  I'd hate Joe Biden to win.
I think that Biden is going to win and also think that it would benefit Cubans/ Venezuelans to pressure him to go tough on both.  Also, DMP is one of the few Democrats who is very good on Vzla/ Cuba.  It'd be tough to lose her and let the tankies run wild.
Interesting dynamic that has a whole lot to do with foreign policy..  Hint, Biden needs to go way more aggressive on Venezuela than the generic fluff he's put out.
I think that it is the dynamics of Cuba/ Venezuela and appreciation of Trump's tough stance against the dictators in both country.  Biden has to do more than just offer TPS.  He really has to assure these people because they felt burned by Obama.
Yeah he fucks porn stars. Let's see what Joe Biden fucks.
Ever heard of hunter Biden??
Nobody falls for concern trolling from Republicans sharing Biden's past support for certain Republican initiatives as if the guys they'd rather have don't want to triple down on every last one of these things.  You aren't good at diminishing support.
Going to suck when Biden gives Trump and his senior administration blanket pardons after Trump refuses to concede.
I know that Biden used big words and you hate that so if you want to talk about cognitive decline I am just going to say 5 words: Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. Is that more your speed?
I have always said the problem with progressives is the people they like are the people America hates. It is never the policies. It is the salesman. Unfortunately a lot of white progressives are very focused on their people. Biden is the best salesman for middle America.
That's not a surprise, wait till they find out what Biden has done.
They put up Biden of course it isn't going to work. Nobody likes that child molester
"I think I'll do well with Bernie supporters" and "Biden is completely controlled by AOC and the radical left" never seemed like a winning combination. Just let us leftists remain depressed about Biden. Why tease us with hope?
Understandable, but I think we need African American voters more than Cubans. Cubans tend to lean republican heavily still, so I wouldn’t be to focused on just that group of voters. I get the voting power in Florida, but I believe that power is part of the RNC coalition.
Yeah, I am not seeing it here. The Fidel boogeyman thing is out of the trump playbook. The one great thing about trump is he sucks all the oxygen up, even when it hurts him.
This is really sad. I don’t like Biden for a number of reasons but his handlers allowing him to make a fool of himself and make it worse with a failed attempt at humor is verging on elderly abuse. Snarky comments to obviate from his dementia made it more pathetic.
This is failure on many levels including failure to recognize China as a threat. Mr. Biden, China must be held accountable. An investigation is a must! China must pay, what’s your policy?
It doesn't bother me. Can't fix stupid, Herman Cain for instance. I will say, when I put out my Biden sign &amp; flag, 2 neighbors quit speaking to &amp; even waving at me.
Oh dear, Joe Biden wrong for moms?  I don’t think so. Most moms teach their kids to be honest and kind, listen to experts, be of service to others and respect women and people of color...like Joe does. Not like our liar-in-chief.
I’m wearing my Tweet less, Listen More Biden for President tee shirt.
Biden better get a carville (not a carvel, tim)
Well said, Annette! I got a Twitter account as a blood pressure lowering device. With Trump out of office, I’m not worried about national safety, mass death and starvation. I’ll drop it when Biden wins.
Biden is beyond tweeting. He can actually speak in real, understandable, words
Joe Biden doesn’t need to stay up all night incoherently tweeting. He’d rather sleep so he can READ HIS BRIEFINGS in the morning and keep America safe and informed.
You’re right Joe Biden will try to get out of having any debate with Donald Trump. We the people want to have these debates move forward so we can make a choice based on what we hear
Is Biden allowed to run for president still?  Then, we are not Venezuela.
Can Biden still run for president?  Great!  Then we do not live in a dictatorship unlike Venezuela where the opposition cannot run in elections.
Following all too! Thank you Pati👏🏾💪🏾
Awesome group of resisters, followed all that were new to me. Thank you. Please follow back
That’s true, your right and I like your pony. but Biden is still a disappointment. And he looks like a puppet out of some weird political si-fi movie. You can’t disagree with that.
Where do Biden’s top VP candidates stand on Israel?
Yes, that's why the four polls showing Biden's leads increasing are in one tweet, and the two polls showing his leads decreasing are in the other. They do this every time, too -- look back.  I'm right, silly. :-)
It had better specifically call Trump all the things that you said Biden was calling him.  I look forward to you applying to the President the phrases "disloyal wannabe dictator," "evil and intent on destroying America," "un-American," and "traitorous intent."
This is a brilliant take. I bet this is where the VP search lands -- the candidate who would be best-positioned to insulate Biden (and Obama).
I wish republicans believed what leftist believe about Joe Biden and I wish leftists believed what republicans believe about Joe Biden.
Looking forward to "I once again vastly overestimated the President. I apologize and now acknowledge that the man is a fascist lunatic, and that Mr. Biden's prediction was not in fact "over the line," but tremendously prescient."  That's what you're writing, yes?
We seem to forget that Trump is a few cards short of a deck. Biden could win a debate by staying on script while Trump goes off about how he's the stablest of geniuses and fittest and the best doctor and best truck driver and whatever he invents for the day.
Biden's team has wisely positioned Joe as the "Not Trump" candidate and done its level best to keep him out of the spotlight and put all of the attention on Trump.   With a big lead, there's not much incentive for Biden to agree to a debate: all risk, no reward.
Time for a new revolution.
Biden looking Presidential and prescient today.
Fun Fact: Joe Biden appeared in several debates for the Democratic Primary. This year. Was he 'great'? No. But is Trump good at debates? LOL, no. Trump would have to answer questions on everything he's done wrong and LOL it's a really long list.
Ohio elected Sherrod Brown. With the right message, Biden can win it.
Enough about Biden, let's talk Kanye.
I think Barr will try to arrest Susan Rice in September when "Dunham Report" (sp?) for unmasking Carter Page comes out; Barr will allege illegal spying. It will be a circus. Susan looks too depressed to me. Resting sad face. Biden has to pick Kamala.
Where is Biden's bishop? Why hasn't he excommunicated Biden? His failure to act while living off the donations of Catholics makes him as guilty as Biden.   Joe Biden promises to undo Trump-era pro-life policies if elected president | News | LifeSite -
Biden for president of the nursing home
100% ABSOLUTELY. Yang made it clear.  1. Biden is one term. So 2024 is an open election. 2. Biden will put Yang in his Cabinet.  This will help Andrew overcome his greatest weakness. Executive experience in DC. He'll see, How the sausage is made." 3. Yang will build connections.
If she was 7 years old he would be a Biden voter.
So you mean that we are going to get support for the "mesita" under Biden and support for fake parliamentary elections where the real opposition cannot run.
I don't know.  I think Maduro thinks Biden wins and is waiting for that.  Although he is humoring the EU because the fake opposition has been a bust (I'm not sure if you saw the story about the lack of candidates), he cannot promote some sort of rebellion among the "base."
Trump Isn’t Serious About Russia. But Neither Is Biden. - Noah Rothman, Commentary Magazine
I'd be really concerned, if I were the Amish, about Biden's pledge to make all new vehicles electric.
Look to the City of South Milwaukee when results come in. Clinton won it only by a point as it swung against her compared to Obama's 2012 margin and Evers only won by 2. Biden would like to get a 5 point win or better, while Trump would love to pull out a win here. 6/6
This is a region were Biden will want to continue to build on Clinton's 11 point lead here and get closer to Senator Baldwin's win of 15 points, while Trump would love to get close to only losing by around Walker's 7 point margin. 5/6
Fuck, hes gonna make me vote for Joe Biden.
This would mean that both the Dem president and VP candidates would be saps.   Biden Selects Aunt Jemima As Running Mate | The Babylon Bee -
We need Bernie, but corporate democrats won’t let us have him. So now the choices is nazi Russian agent end of democracy. Or Joe Biden so I will take him.
This feels like noise, from a pollster that infamously pulls low numbers for Biden. The NC shift is weird though given other pollsters showing NC being much more deadlocked and these other states far less close. Throw it into the averages I guess.
I don't think a soft touch will work.  What I've been arguing Biden should do is get tough on Maduro like the EU finally did.  Diplomatic/ economic pressure from EU, even weak sanctions, is worth a lot more than with Biden because Maduro expects them to bless his frauds.
Maduro isn't going to be willing to actually negotiate anything unless he feels cornered and he thinks Biden is going to throw them a lifeline.  I do hope that they can get more aid into the country but other than that, there is nothing to be done.
I agree that they need to be working out something but unfortunately things are on hold right now until the November elections in the US.  If Biden's advisors would repudiate elections, then things might open up but the useful idiots at WOLA are already pushing for the farces
Followed all. Thanks again Chloe.
Does Biden have any idea what an anarchist is?
If you saw Barr’s hearing and trump’s Covid presser today and are still hanging on who the VP pick is going to be before you decide who to vote for you’re an idiot...  I’m with you  ... Biden no matter who! #VoteBlueLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt Because it does.
Who said “Tell Vladimir that it will be easier working with him after the election” in that hot mic moment? Hint—Biden’s best friend. Who did nothing when Russia violated the INF treaty, who ridiculed Romney in the debates for saying that Russia was our greatest threat? Same!
Thank you Chloe!!! #TrumpFailedAmerica
As disappointed as I am I would rather have the Biden team calling the shots than the Trump team.
I’m a Warren dem and I am absolutely voting for Biden.  Whether she’s on the ticket or not.  This is some Russian Troll Farm bullshit right here.
Sure, but how much more wide of a net are the casting with Harris in terms of voters to the left of Biden?
Biden comes to power late Jan. Announces a national lock down in Feb. Second March in a row in quarantine.
Sorry but someone must have written this for Biden.
This is very much fluff.  I'd like to know what Biden's specific proposals are on Venezuela.  Does he consider Falcon and the "mesita" to be opposition?  Would he push for the opposition to organize and vote in favor of the "mesita's" candidates in parlimentary elections?
What if Biden has to use complete sentences?
The United States private sector will produce a vaccine or treatment. Obama, Biden or Clinton would’ve run all of this through the CDC and we would be so much further behind.
The dems has debates from January through the end of February. 18 people. The virus was mentioned zero times. Trump was taking measures he was mocked for by Biden and Pelosi
I knew it. I knew Biden was no better than trump when it comes to arresting protesters. It’s the same shit in different suits
aside from being biden boy and politics, i love finneas sm honestly
Why was your network afraid to air the Biden press conference live?
won’t even show Biden’s press conference live on now. They must fear the gaffs he is making.
Does Biden consider the "mesita" to be "opposition"?  Because I can never get a clear denunciation of those charlatans from left-leaning foreign policy types and IMO that is the key question on Venezuela.
Yep.  I just added a thread to this on my profile.  The issue with the Biden administration is that people like Rhodes and Rice would be in it and they are stupid enough to fall for Fal$on's BS lies.
The issue I have with Biden is I think that he'll throw Guaido under the bus and do some sort of deal with Maduro.  The administration would be subtle about it and promote the "mesita" and their non-existent electoral solution over Guaido.  Fal$on would get the DC meetings. 2/?
I see alot of Venezuelans for Joe Biden arguing that Biden will be better on Venezuela because he'll do a better job coordinating with the allies and getting EU sanctions.  This would be an outstanding argument if I felt that Biden was going to continue to support Guaido. 1/?
There’s plenty that would be inconvenient to remember about the Obama administration’s role in the Russia-collusion investigation, writes
It is perfectly safe to send kids back to school in Illinois, especially my area of Illinois.  I gave you the stats.  Why are you using the kids as a prop against Trump?  I expected more of Biden to be honest.
I want Biden to speak in favor of school reopenings and against virtual learning garbage.
Sanders Campaign Co-Chair Compares Endorsing Biden to Eating a ‘Bowl of Sh*t’
Not a good look. What do we get for Biden? Nothing only that trump will be gone.
I love your comparison to shit and voting for Biden
This is not Biden's America.
We will never hear from Joe Biden again after his concession speech on November 3rd
will i ever meet biden boi
Agrees. Ironically, Biden's expectations are lower than Trump's for debate, so more upside here than people think for Joe.
IL-10: The Tenth is a light red district that includes parts of McHenry, Kane, Lake, and DuPage counties. After losing to Sean Casten in 2018, a Biden midterm allows Pete Roskam (R-Wheaton) to return to the Hill. 14/
Let's peek into a potential (and extremely unlikely) Illinoisan future. It is June 2021, and Joe Biden's vice president Tammy Duckworth has left a vacant Senate seat. Running off of her suburban appeal after defeating Randy Hultgren in the 14th district and her 1/
🙄. This is based on zero evidence. All evidence shows that the middle is falling behind Biden and Democrats. John Kasich was even discussed as being a speaker at the DNC! This tweet is nonsense.
When looking at the vote change map you can see how Evers did better almost everywhere in Kenosha County. Biden will want to either copy or improve upon Evers' performance. 4/5

Let’s see what Joe Biden does when he loses?
What happens if Joe Biden refuses to accept election results?
Joe Biden is a perfect example.
omg good job biden boi!!!!!1
I don’t care who Biden’s picks. Every Republican needs to be voted out. Over 146,000 Americans are dead because of their incompetence.
There is no reason to have remorse.  This is the very reason she’s a strong candidate.  Biden isn’t going to want someone who backtracks.  He wants someone with a spine who stands by her words.
I’m 100% certain Biden heard what Kamala said to him on the debate stage and she still made his short list of VPs.   This is politics. He’s not looking for a VP who is going to stand next to him and just nod and smile.  Wake up, people!
It is good that the Norwegians met with Guaido's group, not with the bozos of the mesita.  A more realistic fear than the EU or Biden endorsing Maduro outright is them endorsing Maduro's dingbat pawns as the real opposition.
If Joe Biden doesn’t pick a PoC as a running mate he will squander a unique historical opportunity. It’s time.
Under-discussed point Democratic governors in key states could help Biden. Less voter surpression in NC, PA, WI &amp; MI. And those states don’t need much to flip. If Cooper is winning by a wide margin easier to see Biden doing well in NC.
Apparently having questions about Biden's foreign policy views makes me a moron...  Shut up and drink the Koolaid.
I was hoping that Biden would gently repudiate Obama's sh*t foreign policy because he had always been more of a realist compared to the absolute naive garbage pumped out by Obama/ Rice like being "nice" would make bad guys like Iran and Cuba like us.. but guess not.
I could vote for neither...  How about that choice?  All I know is that J. Guaido and all the freedom fighters in Venezuela are screwed if Susan Rice gets to direct foreign policy just like they were screwed under Obama.  Sad because I thought better of Biden.
I'm mail-in voting, but it's Illinois, so something has REALLY hit the fan if Biden doesn't win here.
I cannot vote for Biden if she gets the nod.  That would suggest an endorsement of Obama's worst foreign policy initiatives - Cuba "thaw," Iran deal, etc.
The Lincoln Project wants to convince GOPers to vote for Biden by puffing the architect of Obama sh*tty foreign policy as VP for some reason.
Why?  She was horrible as Obama's NSA.  Do you really want bad deals like sucking up to the Castros to be on the table during Biden's presidency?
The issue is that Trump is capricious and changes his whims.  In this regard, Biden would be better.  The issue with Biden is his unwillingness to play "bad cop" and press for a solution.
The federal government doesn’t fund the police.
The best part is that the people standing around aren knocked over...just the wall
So you are telling me that if I vote for Biden, the sanctions are going to be stronger and the troops are going to be staged in Colombia ready for an invasion?  Because that isn't the vibe I am getting.
Biden will never do an interview unless he gets all questions first
Joe Biden will never be heard from again after his concession speech
The difference between Trump and Biden is one of them knows what he doesn’t know and what he should hand off to others.. The other is a fucking moron ( Credit to Tillerson)
Whew.. I was concerned Biden would defund police.. Guess I will switch my vote back to Biden.. PS only Trumpsters believe that shit
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You do realize Biden shitting himself is a very real possibility?
Will Hillary replace Biden.  #Biden2020 #hillary #Trump2020
Biden still hasn’t said Dickie mcGeezaks about what happened in Portland Kyle Kulinski
#CognitivelyThere can Biden say: ” Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV?” He doesn't need to. He's busy with plans to clean up Trump’s mess and end Corona Virus.
Twitter buzz or hot takes don’t translate into votes - Biden under-estimated &amp; the left hasn’t processed why they lost
A Joe Biden cabinet would be center right not left wing
Biden would have the same as Barack Obama’s administration. That wasn’t a left wing progressive administration. What kind of Supreme Court picks would we get from the guy who voted for Clarence Thomas?
Joe Biden wanted a police bill of rights in the 1990’s do you think he’s changed
He can beat Biden off? Ewww.
Virtual phone banking. Donated to Biden. Visibility with bumper sticker and Biden Tee Shirt.
How do we know Joe Biden would do the opposite?
#FACTCHECK  The Committee to Defend #realDonaldTrump has been running a misleading #Facebook ad campaign targeting older voters in #NorthCarolina that twists #Biden words to brand him a #racist.   The ad inaccurately claims that Biden praised KKK members
It seems like Mesa, who seems like the "Joe Biden" of Bolivia is going to win in a walk (but things can easily change.)  People want boring, adult centrism.
...what on earth are you talking about? What candidate? Joe Biden? A person widely considered a rapist and racist among the progressive movement?
Yup. Plus Operation Overtake Blue Cities and things of that nature.  Goal would be to make Biden so busy on Day One that he has to spend 48 hours straight signing EOs to undue the EOs that Trump signed. SCOTUS would be busy, Congress wouldn't do much, it will be nuts.
Look at these people. Biden voters. Imagine aligning with them. Jfc.
Dukakis was good man but had the magnetism of an old shoe. Biden far more charismatic, likable, fun, despite age. And perfect antidote to Trump. Much better story.
Biden will be 46, and the USA will be Germany '46.
This is from tonight. All Biden voters.   Pretty easy decision for most.
Mr. Biden, what’s your policy on China?  Your son worked for China for several years, how can you be tough on China? China did not roll out the red carpet for president Obama. China wants you to win because the words are you can be bought with a price. Please show a strong policy
Biden voters
Not sure this changes anything. Talk to voters. Highlight Trump’s failures; Biden’s compassion. Win at the ballot box-Priorities. If  wants to skip the inauguration, so be it. First Lady Jill Biden can toss his sorry ass onto #BlackLivesMatterPlaza . Bye, Felicia.
All I know is he supports Joe Biden and he has since the primary started
Biden would have saved over 146,000 American lives.
What sane person would vote for Trump in 20.  If they despise Biden so much then bounce Trump for a stable mature Republican alternative.
Karen bass s gonna be VP.
My smart 6 year-old’s got a message for Biden that he should hear! #voteforchange #voteblue2020 #biden2020 #notmypresident #viral  Skokie, Illinois
Who is the BOOGEYMAN after all destruction in many, many American cities? Off cause Libmob,  BLM, ANTIFA Demparty   But Left media, MSM, Biden pushing narrative the BOOGEYMAN is Trump.  What is your thoughts?
The NBA needs to cut ties with China. It’ll keep Biden out of the White House and fannies out of the seats.
So why is it OK to trash her and put her credibility and past under a microscope, but take everything Biden says at face value? He has hit on Senate staff members in the pasta s well. There have been witnesses to his come ons DAYS after his late wife's death.
Biden claimed his late wife and son were hit by a drunk driver. The driver was NOT drunk and the accident had been his wife's fault. He lied about getting arrested with Mandela. Wrote the racist crime bill and lied about that. Days ago cribbed Jay Inslee's green bill as his own.
And I would add, if we can question Reade's credibility, we should rightfully question Biden's as well. This man has made a career of lying, deceit and plagiarizing. 1978 he plagiarized a speech by UK Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. He lied about his wife's fatal accident.
If you defend joe biden you are a racist
You established something in your head. If you support Joe Biden you are a racist. If you say any different you are a racist.
And they’re a large donor to Biden’s campaign as well as Comcast
When you look at who is voting for Biden the choice becomes clear.
I personally don't like Trump but have issues with Biden as well.
I'm going to vote for neither Biden nor Trump to be honest.  At least that is how I am leaning.  But I do think the doomers will STFU if Biden is president.
This, IMO, is one of the best reasons to vote for Biden.  The hysteria in the US seems to be wrapped up in the cult of "Orange Man Bad."  Maybe if Biden wins things calm down and we put on our big kid pants.  The only issue is that Biden has been acting as such a scold as of late
As someone who has friends who lived in an actual dictatorship, Venezuela, I find this offensive.  You will be able to vote for Biden in November.
I agree. And also what about the idiocy of claiming that if you won't vote Biden you're helping Trump? So I tell em, if I don't vote Trump, I'm helping Biden so leave me alone!
Shut the front door!  Well, Biden does love baseball, and I can forgive him being a Phillies fan instead of Cubs.
Cancel Biden then.
Make excuses for Biden’s fascism because he’s a Democrat. As they did for Clinton and especially for Obama, a Black Democrat. Obama bombed seven countries and was even harsher on whistle blowers than Trump. Also deported more people than Trump. But he’s Team Blue so...all good.
I think the real PTB (ie the titans of Wall St) are disenchanted with his instability and are confident Biden will deliver more $$$ in the way of military engagement. So Trump is out and Biden is in. Not for any humanitarian objectives though. Trump has ceased to be profitable.
The point of the post is that the protests in the videos are happening right now, DURING Trump's presidency, while Trump's campaign team tries to spin it like it's a fictional dystopia that only becomes real if Biden wins
Perhaps Congress will be doing the legislating in a Biden administration?
The Biden campaign spent all of their funds on snack provisions for the Biden Basement.
Impeach him again.  There's no limit on how many times a president can be impeached.  Don't take Biden winning for granted.  Congress needs to assume trump will win in November and impeach now.
While Biden gets inaugurated, trump is dragged by his hair kicking &amp; screaming.
I agree with Joe Biden.
Both Barak Obama and Joe Biden did a terrific job during their administration. They treated everyone with dignity, respect and compassion. Your claim to fame is being able to say person, man, woman, camera, tv. Moron.
Watch it, compare it to what we have today and for the love of God vote for Biden, no excuses folks!
This is Trending Now #personwomanmancameratv
All I want Biden to say in response to that question is, "How did Mnuchin pay for the $500 billion that was given away to corporate interests he won't disclose to the public? How did he pay for lining the pockets of the already grotesquely wealthy?"
I will infuriate people when I say this. I’d like to see Trump re-elected with the Aden’s winning the Senate. Then they could torture him every day of his life. Investigations. Reimpeachment. Kick him out. Impeach his judges. NONE of which Biden would do.
Biden voter.
I bet he didn’t either, there is nothing he won’t lie about.
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Here you go: Trump touts mental fitness, says Biden 'obligated' to take a cognitive test  via
I believe Mr Biden is the first anti- American presidential candidate.
There was a time when Biden wouldn't have even been considered because of his cognitive skills. Woodrow Wilson wanted a third term but, the word was Getting out about his issues after his stroke.
Can’t wait to see Joe Biden debate trump.I think any of them would be fantastic but I’m leaning toward Val Demings. I see her as sympatico with Biden and her experience in law enforcement may be what’s needed right now.
Given Biden is picking a woman of color as his VP why not pick the most qualified who fits the description in Condaleeza Rice?
The “talking heads” played a huge part in destroying our country. Can you imagine if Yang was our candidate instead of Biden?
What positions held makes Biden a socialist? If the dems wanted a socialist, would they not have picked the truly socialist candidate?
polls are fake but interesting!
Please explain this Biden corruption. He never said any such thing. It’s been proven and it’s what Trump was impeached for was trying to dig up dirt on Biden. Go back to watching Fox trying to push HDQ and “Dr.” Immanuel on you.
Not voting for trump or Biden. Why is this coming to politics 😂😂😂 this is the farthest thing from that
ITrump insiders tell me they're worried about the election — polls say he could lose in a way he never expected
Nutty Nancy is at it again time for her to go into the basement with a Biden
Joe Biden lives in an alternative universe, his basement
Joe Biden’s plan is the same talking points that every Democrat touts, Democrats have been rebuilding impoverished neighborhoods for decades and have done nothing. Democrats make promises they never keep except to raise taxes. Wake up America Democrats are a do nothing party.
The first president I voted for was Ronald Reagan. Biden will be the first Democrat I vote for ever, in any election. Every current member of  &amp;  EXCEPT the honorable  needs to be DEFEATED, not just in 2020, but 2022 &amp; 2024. Scoundrels ALL!
Biden won’t be able to write his name by election time...
Obama and Clooney team up to raise money for Biden   Clooney I thought he left the country, Obama Clooney, pathetic trying raise money for basement dweller Biden
wait thats not ur wife its ur sister u senile lying stealing old fart!
The only person Biden could pick that would give me pause would be a Trump.
Yes and agent Biden 007 IQ
Biden is going down, oh that’s right he’s still in his basement no wonder he looks so sickly looking #Trump2020LandslideVictory #FourMoreYears
I don’t see Biden debating Trump.
A Message From Vice President Joe Biden  via
You are the worst liar Donald J Trump. You keep stating Joe Biden wants to defund the police. You continue to lie. Joe Biden has never said he wants to defund the police. It’s time to get that through your thick skull.
Biden takes aim at Trump over coronavirus in new ad blitz courting seniors   I’m over 65, everything about Biden &amp; the Democratic Party disgusts me. They don’t care about people &amp; especially seniors, dem  run cities &amp; states ignored long term care
In 100 days we're going to make liberals cry again and Biden's going to the ex politicians retirement home
AFFH / Stanley Kurtz / Wow, what an education on tonight’s show ! It’s imparative Trump gets a second term! Expose Biden’s Agenda !! Great Show !! We must prevent this take over of the suburbs!
Your commercial about Joe Biden and defunding the police is a blantant LIE. Joe has never said he supports defunding the police. You perpetuate this lie.  You are losing voters with this LIE. It’s time to man up. Quit the lies.
Two hit pieces against President Trump in less than one hour. I guess Biden never needs to leave his basement since CBS and the other usual suspects are doing his politicking for him. This is garbage.
Still voting Biden

Because Biden is such a poor candidate. They must hide him.
We love him,but the man has no sense of style at all. I think the perception is that a younger candidate would be more fashion conscious,but not our Pete! Joe Biden always wears very well fitting clothes and look at Dr Fauci!For a 79 yo he’s quite stylish, on the cover of InStyle
You mean Biden sign!!
Problem  for Biden is one is a Republican the other is a Democrat who doesn’t exactly like Hoe. If he chooses Harris after she called out his racism on tv then this is a joke. Bottoms seems alright but I don’t see him choosing a mayor.
Yes. This way neither can be coached or claim they have a bad deed and can’t understand a question. Also it benefits Trump to go to to toe with Biden.
Joe Biden’s Inauguration.
Biden will have bounties on Americans in general soon.
No, he’s not. Keep pushing that narrative maybe someday ppl will believe you. Biden, however has said racists things publicly 5 times but no one seems to care.
creepy biden trying tolisten
Go back to sleep grandpa Biden
60 years old, always lived in the suburbs, and also have a career outside the house.  Trump can stick it up his ass, I was doing much better under Obama/Biden.  #neverahousewife
Again. Illegal, therefore irrelevant to the original post implying Biden is going to dismantle the 'culture.' Biden would likely act within the law, unless you think he's going to physically destroy religious and abolitionist statutes.
Obama and Biden 8 years they did nothing but screw the American people, watching them is like watching paint dry, no thanks #Trump2020LandslideVictory #PromisesMadePromisesKept #FourMoreYears
I try to imagine what Joe Biden thinks about Joe Biden.No one loves you for anything except maybe pedophiles that need help staying out of jail. Don't worry you and the rest of the freaks and criminals are going to jail once we have a real president. His name is Biden. Are your internal polls written in crayon?  FAILURE
IDC am voting for Biden no matter who he picks i endorsed Harris for VP but i ain't toxic
A Biden administration would not ban flights from China as he is in their pocket. Plus your economy is 1/500 the US economy and 35x less people.
How original!! I love it! That describes Hiden Biden to a T
like elements on your page but disagree about Biden. He is a good guy..
Thank you Trump's tweet is nothing but a distraction why do people have to fall for this? Come on we need to stop giving Trump anything what he wants is a distraction cause he knows he losing states like Texas and if Biden wins Texas Trump has no path to reelection
Are unicorns sprouting out of Biden’s ass? OF COURSE they won’t
Biden didn't do that
Um no. Affordable care act. Biden was part of that. Obama got it done.
Biden will reform the police, Jot defund alike the want to be dictator who is bypassing the police and sending in a private goon squad to hurt people!  The GOP is sick and enabling this guy to hand out country over to Putin!
I will wait until Biden is Oresident before I consider a vaccine!!
#EvictTrump is trending he is bringing down the value of Mar A Lago and the WH. The value of Trump Tower is also going down the drain if we want to bring back value in the WH we vote for Biden no matter how he does in debate stage.
I will proudly vote for Biden no matter what happens am with you 100%
Most of the things under that trend are about Obama and/or Biden.
Finally some good NH polling. Biden leads 53-40. I’ll say Likely D.
A vote for biden is a vote for whoever he picks as a running mate basically. God Help Us if he wins-Heaven forbid.
This has been talked about for months... Biden accused him of this months ago.  There are no provisions to delay ...so we shouldn’t expect anything less from Comrad Trump.
Biden can pronounce ‘Minneapolis’
Joe Biden supported the war in Iraq, which killed at least 500,000 people directly and many more indirectly. That's about 20,000 Bundys
Joe Biden for President 2020. In my opinion, Trump's all ready lost. He is losing big time in the general election. Trump needs to resign.
Biden for President 2020. Let's see who will win in November. Trump's all ready lost based on how he's handled everything recently. Trump is currently losing in the general election. Deal with that.
Well since Rachel Maddow is off this week i hope she enjoys the time off and gets plenty of rest she will need it for January when they indictments come and news stories of Trumpers being charged breaks news if Biden wins
It won’t be needed ...when Biden takes over, he won’t need that and all the other useless spending trump and his wife in name only want!   We are in the middle of an economic crisis and this jackass is trying to cash grab on his way out!
"I don't want my kids growing up in a jungle, a racial jungle" -Joe Biden, 1977, talking about desegregation
I understand your pitch, but you're not going to convince me that Biden isn't a white supremacist.
I would not worry about NATO. A President Biden will undo the harm. In February 2021, we need a full investigation into the Trump/Putin disaster. Thanks Anthony for standing up to Trump. Maybe you can help rebuild the Republican party.
😂 Biden can’t form a sentence let alone have interviews and Mr. “Dictator of Disney” thinks he’s what’s needed?
As if they will be around to spend it...  Melania is really bored ...perhaps she is filming a new reality show....  Extreme Makeover - WH Edition!   She has a new tennis court and rose garden for the Biden’s in the works...  why not a new West Wing for Trumpy!!
Biden leading in Texas now if that lead holds on election day Biden becomes the president no matter what happens now we need to vote like our lives depend on it to make it happen
"We used to push Biden to put forward a vision beyond beating Trump, but since he won't try, I guess we won't either!"
Well, that sucks. Obviously, that makes Putin happy. The only good thing is that a President Biden can reverse this.
We wait til Biden makes the announcement politico has inadvertently gave the GOP a head start attacking one of his potential VP picks we can't give them anything
Biden was stumbling through his 1 hour press conference.

Barletta did overperform in Luzerne.  I think Trump is favored to carry it, but probably by a similar margin to Barletta even if Biden is winning the state by less than Casey did.
Yeah because most people protesting nazis have a swastika nearby .  They’re   supporters trying to spread their lies at Walmart.

Chris Dodd needs to resign from the VP selections committee and hand over the job to someone more qualified like Amy Klobuchar she would make a perfect adviser one she dropped out of being in commission and she recommended that Biden should pick a person in color as his VP.
It's already happening proudsocialist has said he won't vote for Biden and he used to be a wonderful resister til the day he became a Bernie Bro
WTF Tlaib is not a real democrat for refusing to endorse Biden so starting now i am endorsing her challenger Brenda Jones just like I endorsed Amy McGrath over Charles Booker. Bernie Bros are electing fake democrats and trying to make our party toxic.
There has been chatter for months he is going to have Nikki Haley as it will be a better alternative to Biden &amp; a woman VP.
Prayers for those in hurricanes wake president Biden
😂 You are deluded bruh. First Lady Jill Biden? She’ll be spending more time finding Joe’s memories.
Solid favorite, but still Likely R. I bet Biden makes it to a 5% loss in this district. Went for Obama 2012 and Duckworth in 2016, and narrowly for Pritzker in 2018.  Brendan Kelly’s numbers in the rural counties last time were unimpressive.
Biden needs a running mate that will excite voters and that person is Kamala Harris. Elizabeth Warren would be a great VP but there would be increased risk of lower turnout among the black community and he needs someone young who can take his place and Kamala is the person.
What is the most realistic target for Biden in  "Lean R" category?
Hmm, not a Trump support one bit or Biden. Doesn't matter who wins this election. We're fucked either way.
I think it's a good idea; Clinton won the state by only 2% and there hasn't been a lot of polling. Biden is favored in NV but it is worth spending in.
I am female, white, suburban, mom. My neighborhood is diverse, vibrant, educated, middle class. People stay, if a house goes on the market, it usually sells quickly. Biden is a perfect fit for my vote. DJT is a criminal and s/b in prison.
I’m not denying it is trending right. But Biden won’t be losing the county by 40%. It will probably vote to the left of the state.
Of course there’s a downballot lag- but even Jim Gray won this county in 2016 against Rand Paul.  Biden will improve upon Hillary Clinton in these kind of counties.  Remember- Elliott is an Obama 2012 county.
Not too hot of a take, but Elliott County KY is Likely R at presidential level; it was won by all the statewide Dems in 2019, and Biden at least has a shot there if he is keeping to state to 20%.
#TrumpCantKeepItUp the news that's coming to him Hurricane Hanna tore down Trump's wall he can accelerate the construction all he wants but the construction sites will be turned into bulldozing sights in 2021 Biden will tear down Trump's wall and Trumpers will be crying nonstop.

I think he is trying to keep Biden out....
Stop fucking calling it the China virus asshole! It’s Covid-19! People have told you that this is offensive to Asians, why do you keep saying it! Truth be told, this is the TRUMPVIRUS!!!!!!!!!!  Biden 2020!
Hide till 2021 and let Biden run this Country
He doesn’t have to do anything to prove to me he is capable and better qualified than trump!  Biden speaks eloquently...and above a 3rd grade level!
I doubt Biden would veto a marijuana bill.
This is one of the few criticisms I have for Biden. It needs to be legalized and regulated federally like alcohol/tobacco.  But it’s ok because Congress may not agree- I think some Republicans may even come around, because it could be a fiscal/personal freedom issue.
People that refuse to support Joe Biden aren’t progressives.
1.Trump won't concede  2. It is true that we won't know the results for days and weeks 3. You are correct that we still have to deal with him til January  4. No matter what Trump does between November and January Biden will be sworn in no matter what happens he can't stop it.
He can try all he wants but he can't stop Biden from being sworn in on January if he wins
He should but why can't Pelosi fill in for him til election day then Biden
Harris is the most logical choice she offers a regional advantage she can help Biden win states like Arizona Georgia narrow down Mississippi and win North Carolina
Biden is a dog-faced pony liar.
Screw that...  he doesn’t need to appear on FAUX News..  He doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone!  We already know President Biden is coming!
Dude, legit, I thank you for your service but stop calling yourself a conservative. No self respecting conservative would vote for the shit show that Biden supports.
Clearly you mean Trump has proven this..  145,000 dead Americans!   Disastrous unemployment numbers..  and bad polls compared to Biden!  Be like the rest of the cockroaches on a sinking ship and come to the Biden campaign!
Mr AK probably thought that firing warning shots (ala Uncle Joe “Get a Shotgun” Biden) was a good thing to do.
I bet Biden keeps MN-1 within 5%. MN-8 probably within 10%.
Keep in mind, Biden will also probably do better than Clinton's ~2% margin statewide
Exactly, I bet Biden will narrow the gap in MN-7 to more like 15-20% than 30%- big difference. I also expect him to improve quite a bit in MN-1 and MN-8 (Trump will probably carry both districts, but not by 15%).
Yeah, Lean D is reasonable, I do expect Biden to carry the state, but anything more is way too presumptive for such a close state.
I agree, I think Biden is favored in AZ, but Kelly will outrun him by a few percent.  McSally is basically screwed unless Trump completely turns this election around- which isn’t impossible, unfortunately
How bout "if you have trouble figuring out if you're for me or Trump. You ain't black." - Joe Biden. That one's pretty good how about “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” - Joe Biden
Trump is the only hope!! Hiden Biden is a puppet
A pretty safe district I'm watching- Oregon 4th District. Clinton won this district by 0.1%, but I believe Biden is in little danger of losing it to Trump. DeFazio is a longtime incumbent, but has only been challenged by the same perennial candidate for several elections(1/2)
Just wait until the oppo researchers get into Joe Biden's freezer. He's probably been hoarding rare Ben and Jerry's flavors.
Biden isn’t the one bragging about a cognitive test that Koko the Golrilla also passed!!  Moron
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot this message!
I wish all 11,460 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden built white guilt and resentment.
Fucking gross. Sorry but no other words describe this
A Trumper took a screenshot of my profile picture and typed the words no need to fear Biden's bitches are here and i take it as a compliment lol I am a loyal Biden supporter and proud of it raise your hand if you are a loyal Biden supporter.#Biden2020
Waiting for my Biden yard sign has not arrived yet.
Plus it'll be a good year for Dems. It's the kind of situation where if Lipinski had been primaried in a Biden midterm, and the R's had a candidate with money, it would be Likely D. It's a suburban district, but more WWC than suburban districts like IL-6 and IL-14.
Reasonable. I’d say OK-5 is probably Tilt R, if you say Rs have the advantage.  Republican runoff is a liability, both candidates aren’t doing so great with funds, and Biden may even win the district this time.
Source? I hope Biden announces her as VP next week endorsed Harris for VP not long after Super Tuesday and not long after Bernie dropped out
Same if he does that Biden is winning Arizona New Mexico and Nevada since they similar voting groups
Agreed I will not take a vaccine from our country til Biden becomes president he will be the one releasing the vaccine to the public
Trumpers can laugh at my reply of saying Biden has the lead in Florida all they want but if Biden wins the state we will be the ones who said told you so and we will have the last laugh and the last word and I can't wait it will be satisfying
Also the economist is giving Biden an 85% chance of winning Florida a state that typically votes to the right of the popular vote and undecided voters typically end up going to the GOP
Another day, another example of how Trump is the one who is insane, and Biden just has a lifelong stuttering problem which can be edited to own the libs
Not happening since you are already making Democrats, that we’re neutral or civil, leave because of the Communist angle you are endorsing. Hell you’re using Biden.
How can Biden be for science when he can’t form a sentence or think Black Trump supporters aren’t black for some reason? As far as I know voting against Democrats doesn’t scientifically mean you go against your skin color.
Even Newsweek can't avoid admitting that Biden is obviously full of shit. "Overtures to appear receptive to their needs"
You mean a CDC that admitted to lying about the cases recently? Biden? How much did he and the nurses caress you to vote for him?
2016 polls vs current polls hear that Trumpers Biden has a stronger lead than Hillary did he outperforming her margins he is not as well hated. The attacks against Biden don't land and they were not that far off if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins period math is math.
Trumpers questioned the polls in Florida which Biden is leading by 6% do they realize the polls were near spot on on election day 4 years ago Trump was leading by 0.4% when he won by 1.2%. Assuming they make same mistake they made 4 years ago Biden wins Florida period.
Oh such a sweetie..poor little guy wants to go to school. You will get us back to normal with God's grace president Biden..
Thank you Amy if Biden's lead in Florida holds he wins the state all he needs is one more swing state and he is president and there is nothing maga can do about it math is math
I think Biden is likely to improve on Clinton in most of the ancestral Dem Appalachian counties. Hillary Clinton was basically the worst possible candidate for those areas. I think Biden will lose WV by more like 30% than 42%.
You forgot no country.  Biden is working with Sanders &amp; AOC right now to open the borders to Soetoro’s OFA and Soros’ OSI, make this a sanctuary country for anyone who wants to come, allow everyone to vote (no ID  req’d), turn all private property to the State for communal use.
I mean, it's possible if Biden continues to dominate, though I'm doubtful about MO and IN, even in a huge landslide I think SC would go blue before them.
Biden is an infinitely better candidate than Trump. American icon? He’s a damn con man. But I guess if you’re one of the ones who has been conned, you’ll go to great lengths to justify supporting him.
It really did seem like Dems were in Disarray at that point.  Luckily Delaware is beyond Safe with Biden as the nominee.
100 days til election day everyone and 100 days starts an important journey for Biden it will test if Biden's lead is really as strong as polls suggest or will the election be closer than we thought.
So vote for Biden? The (D)evilAwakens
Even if polls in Florida are off by same margin they were in 2016 Biden still wins Florida and if Texas is off too Biden wins
Trump's playbook in connecting Biden to the far left like Bernie Sanders isn't working at all according to the guests in the reidout show they hoped to use this playbook if Bernie Sanders was the nominee but that didn't work so nominating Biden foiled his plans and I am relieved
Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping now at 71% down from 72% a 1% may not seem like a big deal but the fact that Trump's chances of winning Texas are dropping is a very good sign for Biden if he wins Texas Biden becomes the next president no matter what happens
The economist unlike fivethirtyeight has a predicted range of electoral college votes and Trumpers think that Trump will win by a landslide that is simply not going to happen Trump's EC range is 123-279 Biden's range is 259-415 Trump is loosing support period.
Biden's polling is much better than Hillary Clinton's. He has a more consistent and larger lead in swing states. Trump's campaign is effectively over.
Not a good poll at all for Goroff…. behind by 7% and underperforming Biden by 7% in her own internal.....
Biden. Not a landslide, but a convincing victory.
These numbers are terrible for Trump. The only way he wins is if him and Biden are equally as unpopular in swing states, and that clearly isn't the case.
Very interesting map. Biden is ahead in my zip code (60126) by 335-194; it went for Clinton by about 15% in 2016.
And also yeah, fuck Obama and Biden. Both are racist. This just isn't a conversation about them. I don't know why you keep bringing them up
Also *** future President Biden will make it right with
Notice how little presence Biden needs on the campaign trail. The more trump blunders about, the more minds are made up. I would be surprised if there are even Presidential debates this year. People want to vote and wrap this up.
Biden has lost it.
Don’t care..  won’t watch...  I’d rather watch Biden...he is sharper mentally than you are!!  He also doesn’t brag about a acing a cognitive assessment test!!
The fact that Biden is doing better in Pennsylvania than in Michigan and Wisconsin means he has home field advantage
Lol. Walk into traffic. Save yourself. Trump and Biden aren’t doctors. Neither is bill gates. Elite as in people who run the world. Not doctors who’ve been lied to as well.
We won't be i am just saying we should be spending money in races that are winnable and Texas is winnable now if you were to ask me that 6 months ago I would have said no way. Things are constantly changing Biden is most likely going to be spending time in the south and rust belt
I’m a suburban housewife, and you’re the LAST person I want preserving my neighborhood. You’ve done enough damage to our country! President Biden will restore all that is good back to our country. November 3 can’t come fast enough!
New poll by Quinnipiac University has Biden up by 13% which just got released today and they have a B+ rating according to fivethirtyeight
New poll came out today showing Biden up by 13% according to the Quinnipiac University poll which has a B+ rating by fivethirtyeight
Holy cow a new poll released by Quinnipiac University which has a B+ rating by fivethirtyeight shows Biden up by 13% in Florida i mean wow Biden up by double digits in a state that is typically so close it takes a long time to call the state. If this lead holds Trump is doomed.
Exactly Biden's lead is narrowing according to fivethirtyeight he was up by 9% on average now 7.7%
According to the economist Biden has a 90% chance of winning Pennsylvania 88% for Wisconsin 90% for Michigan. Trump has a 72% chance of winning Texas we must change this if we going to win Texas and lockdown the rust belt if we win Texas Biden wins the election no matter what.
Thank you madam president the Biden's VP pick will be targeted by bogus claims and they plan to target her cause they are sexist and afraid of strong women
Biden gets Creepier &amp; Creepier all the time.
Common Tony, we all know if Biden or Killery somehow was president this virus would have NEVER happened🤔🤔🤬🤬 we do know that ISIS would've probably overtaken most of America,and most of us would not have had JOBS 🤬🤬🤬🤬  #TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Strong ? The only strength is in numbers is Republicans voting for Biden and the numbers on the virus moron #TrumpMeltdown
Absolutely true. I wish you luck in getting Biden close to 40% and saving our nation from a 2nd term of Trump.
The Presidential debate moderators has come up with their first question for Joe (Mr. Magoo) Biden, What color is the White House?🤪
Not trying to dissuade you, I hoped for Bernie and I'm voting Biden too. We just need better in the future.
I'm not a fan of his. But wouldnt it help him more to let crime go out of control here. He says repeatedly that all of america will look like chicago if Biden wins. LolBiden has a communist on his short list, Karen Bass.  She wants to eliminate anti-discrimination laws to legalize discrimination against those w/ a #WhiteStory, #RedStory, etc.  Their plan, sacrifice you the individual for the “Altruistic Goals” of the State.  #twill
DUH???  What planet is Trump on?  Does Biden know where he is?  Someone please stop this LEFT/RIGHT MADNESS!!!
LOL. . .mask NAZI, probably a Biden athletic supporter
But you are supporting a Biden one
Damn right! I'd *also* like Dems to state--for the record--that any move to fill a Supreme Court vacancy between now and 1/20/21 will lead to TWO new Supreme Court seats being created (and filled) by President Biden.
Can you imagine the absolute shit fit  Hannity, Rush Dipshit and all the other fucks would have had if either Clinton, Obama, or Biden even loosely hinted at delaying an election?
This will definitely get Bernie voters to flock to Biden if she's picked
Biden has the greater intellect &amp; emotional intelligence. Voting third party is not my choice as there is not a viable candidate.
Remember when you said this was just some conspiracy bullshit? Is it bad your opponent knows you better than yourself?
Where’s your apology to Joe Biden?
Gosh Bernie, it means we’ll vote for Biden for sure.  Freebies mean everything to us.  We’ll do anything for the Big Brother who takes care of us.
Biden’s got voters in Erie, PA!
Come on over. Do you really think Biden will be making the decisions? They will kick him out within 6 months with the 25th. Then a possibility that Pelosi would be VP. Do you really want that?
I can only hope that The Lincoln Project does an ad titled “Trump’s AmeriKKKa “ with highlights from Lafayette Sq., Portland, Seattle and anywhere his gestapo thugs have been. The violence is now, caused by him not Biden.
Biden is a useful idiot and it shows.
If Biden chooses a good VP candidate like Tammy Duckworth, Trump wouldn't stand a chance.
I swear to god, Biden is gonna pick Kamala because the only thing he consistently does is make shitty decisions.
Speaking of Russia, are you going to address the Bounties on our Military or just let Biden when he takes over ???
So their saying Harris is Joe’s VP pick a woman you gave blowjobs to get were she is today wow and She would be the first Female President well all I can say it’s good thing her and Clinton isn’t there at the same time wow Harris and Biden is the best Democrats have to offer
Biden is the guy who says the grink
Meanwhile Joe biden is locked in his basement so he'll keep his hands off young girls and you've said nothing about it.
98 days till election and counting.. go for Biden’s cabinet!
It was so classy of President Biden to pay his respects to John Lewis.   Former President 45 probably had a hard time collecting his liddle thoughts, and getting down the ramp to attend.   #Trumplethinskin #Sniffles #ImPOTUS #imPEACHED
Biden is going to have to do such a massive cleanse of the White House before he moves in.
And this is why, at any other moment, I’d never vote for Biden. However, there are two clear reasons to vote for him: he’s not Trump; Harris as VP.
You're mindless drones that just use "competent biden guy bad, orange man good" arguments. Hilarious.
It is a big deal. Biden will move as the party moves. Put more progressive into congress and the Senate and he will keep getting dragged left along with them.
I got a running list of things for which Biden needs to apologize, but he will still get my vote. Harris is my choice for VP no apologies necessary.   Trump is using the Constitution as toilet paper &amp; people want her to grovel? We are in trouble
Your tweet confirms trump has a real chance at winning 4 more years. I've said the same thing &amp; got the same argument from some independent voter.  Biden was my 2nd to last choice but he will get my vote to try to get out of a dictatorship
You can dislike Biden, and be critical of his flaws, while still acknowledging the reality that he is very different from Trump in many policy areas.

I'm also on the democratic mailing list and only get 1 maybe 2 emails a month though and never got this many before Trump. I dont normally donate to campaigns but I probably would donate to Biden if he chose Duckworth as VP
Minnesota has elected very radical democrats. Two people being stupid, whether real or not these days is not an example of one party.  Biden has been in politics for 45 years. In order to do that he's had to change sides/opinions countless times.  Keep putting career dems back
Are you saying biden is not winning Minnesota?
Okay...but does that REALLY matter? This election ain't about money. Biden campaign brought in more money last quarter if I'm not mistaken. If EW ain't President, she should stay in Senate or accept cabinet position.
Biden pushes to teach Islam in U.S. public schools
The greatest threats to America are Joe Biden, the Democrat Party, Antifa, BLM and the obscene racist ideology of ‘antiracism’.  Next to these, China is a piker.
Wanna back up what you said? As of now it's literally a fact that biden was in the office and helped spy on the incoming administration. Is that what you meant?
I realize that after Biden is elected you will again be the opposition, but it will be good to have they loyal opposition rather than this idiocy we’ve had.  I am hoping the Republican Party comes to its senses and Trumpism dies as ignominiously as it started.

WOW, Mr. Trump!! Your COVID press conference has made me reconsider your failures of the last 3.7 years. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW IS BRING ALL THE UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY AMERICANS YOU KILLED BACK TO LIFE! When this is done I will consider voting for you this November. #Biden
How is this Biden’s protest? Trump is President right now, while this is occurring, and he is actively making the situation worse.
Racist, Facsist, Authoritarian imbecile, damn fool. These are Trump’s calling cards. America needs better! NOW. #Biden
It will be much better when President Biden unveils President Obama's official portrait. Trump doesn't deserve the honorYes. Will vote Biden
So we’re going to forget that Biden has done less in 40 years as a politician than trump in 4? 💀
Those toxic Biden Bros at it again.
I guess this proves that Biden/Harris is the blue ticket.
I hate that we have to vote for Biden cause there’s nobody better
I wonder if all the Dems who were ok with Trump’s campaign being spied on would be ok if he were to do the same to Biden.
Per the U.S. Constitution, he cannot delay the election! #DicatorTrump is trying to defer and distract the American people from his epic failure of a response to the pandemic with his deployment of federal paramilitary forces into Democratic run cities, and blame Biden and Obama.
Biden only cares about his donors. Just be honest. Biden is not a good person. Biden has never been a good person
There won’t be a debate unless Biden feels he’s losing &amp; has to do it. right now Bidens not feeling the heat so he’ll make up some excuse to avoid having to go toe to toe with the President.
I love how every Trumper is an expert on Joe Biden’s daily activities and his mental health

Without a single solid doubt, this is the most disgusting, disrespectful, and disgraceful thing that I have seen on Twitter! These idiotic Trump supporters, wearing swastikas as face masks, say, "A vote for Joe Biden = a vote for Nazis." Totally disgraceful to America!
Hey man I get it. Trump may say dumb things, but if you look he’s doing great things. Biden has had 40 years in office, and his most successful bill locked up more black Americans. Trump freed them with the First Step Act. Vote for who you want, I just ask you do your research

Levin bashes Obama eulogy for John Lewis, calls Biden 'a quasi-Bull Connor and a quasi-George Wallace'
8 years to make a difference and he and Biden failed. Now he does the only thing he’s good at, making a speech.  He should be ashamed as the 1st black president he didn’t help black people very much!
If he’s going to repeat what is said in his ear, there will be an awkward delay as well as some Joe Biden moments lmao! Can’t wait to see this illiterate moron try to pull this one off
Agreed. Biden wasn’t my first choice, but I would rather have a vacant seat than 4 more years of this.

I have nothing against Daines. I'm not trying to smear Biden. It's not my fault that Biden is a pedophile. What are you complaining about?  The dude is straight up pinching two girls' nipples. Why do you insist on defending him? Trump is a pedo Nazi, so why vote for another one?

I just want to point out that your picture of “elect women” is sexist. I vote on policy, not sex. Also, with so many genders out there these days, just voting for women doesn’t seem very woke. I just hope you don’t misgender someone you vote for. Does Biden identify as a woman?
Biden will sniff out little girls that's for sure. What a creepy old man! Out of the millions of people in the US and Biden is the only thing the dems can come up with lol.
