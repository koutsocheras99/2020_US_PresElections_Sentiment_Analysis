Great piece, but they won't lockdown.  We are the States. The United part is an illusion, thanks to Trump/GOP greed, contempt for fellow citizens (even their "base") and malice toward governance. Our civil war is now biological. Hopefully, our democracy will not die of COVID.
No. That‚Äôs the Trump base that‚Äôs insane. And uneducated ignorant voters.

We need the DNC to stop screwing over decent candidates to push their narrative simply because they know their supporters hate trump enough to vote for literal Satan to take his place.  I've yet to have a presidential candidate I've felt good about voting for in my lifetime.
I think trump will win re-election and I think it will be one step closer to me killing myself
Total propaganda to make the majority of Trump supporters feel good about themselves.
Guys, I heard Trump is going to fight to help women get the vote, and make committing a murder punishable by law!
Wait... Trump owns expensive country clubs?   Why didn‚Äôt you guys report on this before? Lol  We would have never voted for him... hahaha
I hate seeing the racist usage of calling it a countries name virus. It's not the China virus. It was from there. Who cares. It is how you deal with it in life. The way Trump fans handle this I will call it the COCK Virus. Conservative Oblivious Caucasian Klan Virus #COCKVirus
Honestly speaking, Laura Ingraham is a seriously sick woman.  Laura and Trump are on the same page, they believe COVID-19 is not harmful and is going to be magically disappear, despite thousands continue to die everyday
Trump spoke the truth.
One of these is Joe Biden. The other is the mumblings of a blithering idiot.  Everyone in Trump world should be doing everything they can to keep trump quiet until Nov 3rdü§£

As we quickly approach 165,000 deaths I want to say FUCK YOU to the  62,979,879 people who voted for trump and to every single Republican Politician In This Country  Allowing this pandemic to sweep across our country is an Act Of Domestic Terrorism. The callousness of say that

As pandemic relief talks fail, Trump readies executive actions - The Washington Post
much of the blame does indeed fall on trump, but the structural deficiencies in american society (i.e. capitalism) are ultimately responsible

That's a tough one. I've been pondering this question a lot recently. I think they're both damaging, but in somewhat different ways. Trump seems like the more immediate danger, but Biden represents the potential for the liberal capitalist economic order to further entrench itself

Why dont you form your own opinion instead of piggy backing off every single thing your commander in chief decides to do. This scares me because if joe gets elected what are you going to talk about? Like your career is done if trump isnt president. Lmao you have no content.
I have literally never seen somebody so obsessed and career dependent upon mocking one man. I wonder who your audience even is because nobody I know ever even mentions you. Your jokes flat out suck. You just mock trump all day long. At a certain point you just shake your head...

Right.  I see folks talking about the cost of Obamacare, but we shouldn't forget it was Trump who's elimination of the minimum annual fee of $75 caused lots of younger healthier participants to exit and drove costs for others u p.
Seems like this should be getting at least as much attention as sports &amp; Trump today, right? #ohshit #ClimateChange
It goes without saying at this point, but Trump is a fucking moron.

Sometimes when someone comments on the post, it shows they like it. It‚Äôs happened to me when I was giving a magat hell on a tRump post.
This is unreal ,Trump did not cause the pandemic . someone in a foreign country released this virus and has taken the world so is Trump supposed to be responsible for the whole world? Its not possible for one man with no help or backup to stop stop such a thing . Only battle it.
President Trump wants to ban TikTok in the USA. I never wanted that app but now I suddenly do. #tiktok #voteblue
Sarah...What will you want Trump to do when they "take to" YOUR street and no local authority does anything about it? These streets are bordered by peoples' private property and it's being destroyed.

I heard about this &amp; I find the whole thing disgusting! I am so angry with the Dems right now, I can't see straight. I want to get rid of Trump as he is destroying the country, but I want reps who will represent the American ppl &amp; NOT their donors. We're in a rock &amp; a hard place!
So why would Trump want to close Tiltok?
Never said covid is a lie! Said the numbers are not correct and the foreign agencies don't fully disclose.  Didn't matter who was elected. Can't expect anyone to fully control a pandemic. I'm quite sure the trump has plenty to do besides with all the frame jobs!
If you hate Donnie and the whole trump clan as much as I do. Then I want follow you!
LoL. Always back to impeachment when we all know that was a farce and the real perpetrators behind the whole thing is close to being exposed and most likely charged for treason. Every one want to blame trump but all he really did was win an election and exposed all the corruption
Trump says he will ban TikTok. He's trying to silence a generation.

Let‚Äôs talk-I don‚Äôt support trump 100%. Economics, I think he does well. Foreign policy I‚Äôd give him a b+. However, his Covid response was garbage. I‚Äôm concerned for his mental state due to tweets. Making his decision making questionable. HOWEVER, I don‚Äôt trust Biden mentally!
I‚Äôve always loved me some  but, trump made me appreciate/respect him so much more. There is no comparing the two.

I wonder how much press this will get.  (Note: please do not interpret this tweet as me endorsing Trump. I‚Äôm not. Just to be clear.)
You are almost as bad as Shaun KIng who wants Biden to be a rubber stamp for King and those who think like King. This kind of thinking is why Trump is in office now, yet from reading this, you seem to want another 4 years, if Biden doesn't pick the VP U like.

Yup.   I hate Trump and all he stands for but it depends on the VP If I vote for Biden is just another way of saying.  But.her.emails.  Give me a break
As woefully incompetent and unqualified as I would be for the role, if I got the nod, you still vote Biden. Because he's not Trump.  See, it's that easy.

Trump's ad men are masters of the self-own. Trump looks like an ignorant, preening buffoon while Biden is shown as a serious,  thoughtful, and devout man. This is as bad as their ads trying to scare you about "Biden's America" using pictures of Trump's actual America.

Yeah, I'm not sure Dems are really extremely concerned about a state Trump won by 10 points.

I do not intend to imply whether the supposed advances for the gay and lesbian communities are good or bad. I am merely analyzing the political strategy behind this quote which is supposedly meant to engender support for Trump over against Biden.
Setting aside the accuracy of this claim for a moment, I find this tactic very curious. Most of Trump‚Äôs voter base would not consider this a selling point. Certainly not Evangelicals. It seems the Trump campaign has more to lose than gain here. Am I wrong?

Of course. His candidacy is a fraud. He won‚Äôt be on the ballot in enough states to win even 100 electoral votes.  The only purpose his candidacy serves is to play spoiler for Trump in specific key states.
...which now his campaign appears to be making Biden seem weak by photoshopping out pictures of him worshipping the same God written in that Bible.   Trump is the real fake news.
The funniest part about this is where was Trump when protesters where at his door demanding justice for black lives across the country? ....hiding in his basement.....   Then he proceeded to tear gas folks so he could take a picture with a Bible in front of a church....
this perplexes me so much... why are you demanding that trump wield powers he does not and no one wants him to have including his own supporters.

"Florida's Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot &amp; Vote by Mail!"
Watching Trump and Biden debate is gonna be like listening to a Google Home and Amazon Echo talk to each other.
Open schools but no vote-by-mail (unless the state would benefit Trump). Mail is unreliable, but Trump is in charge of USPS and mail has become less reliable when needed most.  Covid is no big deal but is also germ-warfare by China!  Blatant hypocrisy is cheered by Trumpers. Sad.
Almost guaranteed that Biden will win this (especially if he stays underground and doesn't speak out of his dumb little mouth) because Trump has been such a disaster during coronavirus   but that doesn't change the fact that Biden sucks, Biden is abysmal, Biden is terrible
Presidents typically seek to hold their nominating conventions in a state seen as crucial to their chances of winning the election, but this year's coronavirus outbreak has forced candidates to drastically change the way they campaign.

President Donald Trump has signed legislation into law that will devote nearly $3 billion annually to conservation projects, outdoor recreation and maintenance of national parks and other public lands.
Most interesting part of this Trump interview to me is when Swan asks him "What does systemic racism mean to you?" And he answers "I hope the answer to that question is ‚Äì now do I ‚Äì does anybody really answer that question accurately? Does anybody really know?"
What‚Äôs a soul sells for these days? With the GOP power grabs, it can‚Äôt be much .  "Oh, we'd fill it," McConnell said with a smile when asked last year whether he would act to confirm a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court should a seat become vacant.

The Trump administration has actually done a great job throughout this. They‚Äôve handled it well. Only mistake was closing down the economy but easy to second guess that now. It it were a Dem. in office they wouldn‚Äôt even care about these numbers. It‚Äôs all political at this point.

Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to the virus.
"Americans are dying, that's true, and it is what it is," Trump said. "But that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can. It's under control, as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us."
Watch/listen to this if you can stomach the nonsense.
This is the most lucid clip that I‚Äôve seen, demonstrating the way Trump uses data to see what he wants to see. And it seems he really believes that more testing = more cases, which is as concerning as it is erroneous.
Looks like someone FINALLY held Trump to the bullshit he says.
The Trump administration‚Äôs plan to provide every nursing home with a fast COVID-19 testing machine comes with an asterisk: The government won‚Äôt supply enough test kits to check staff and residents beyond an initial couple of rounds.

It's amazing to watch how Trump crumbles instantly when he's challenged at all.
Sen. Grassley, I note you said you wouldn't have attend the Republican convention had it been held. That senator is using common sense. We note the president doesn't follow your lead. He tends to fly off the handle. Please don't follow Trump and his nonsense.

I come from an area swarming with Trump supporters, they even have a billboard. I can't even make sense of their logic. They act like he is god and that it is all "fake news". How do you deny the stupidity in this video? This man is unfit for any political or leadership position.
First of all the media riding your ass over every decision is part of the gig. 2) trump is &amp; has always been antagonistic to them &amp; brings a lot of the shit on himself (like when he used the sharpie on the storm forecast map because he couldn‚Äôt just admit he was wrong

Hey  Trump wants to federalize voting.
if ur enthusiastic about either candidate its because of the other one. that is anti-trump and anti-biden enthusiasm.
if trump tweeted 2+2= 4 the left would claim math was racist..  oh wait they already are.  its just not worth being aggravated by things that politicians say to each-other, they are crazy incompetent morons. let them be and move on from it.
Jsut because trump says something that happens to be generally correct even in the wrong context doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong
I ignore most of the stuff trump rambles on about. Couldn‚Äôt care less. Mailin voting is not a good solution. Acting like idiots over trump pointing that out doesn‚Äôt solve anything
I mean most talking points are pretty stupid. Saying mail in voting was bad was not a trump talking point until dems flipped upside down because he was asked about his opinion.
Ur getting hung up on trump. It‚Äôs never been a thing cause it‚Äôs not reliable and to easy to abuse and takes ages. Fact that trump mentioned it being unsavory when everyone has said that for Decades is irrelevant. Dems just react to him on it now and switched their stance

I know we've said for five years SNL could just read out the transcript, but Axios may have created a better skit than SNL could. The eyerolls from Swan, the camera movement, Trump shuffling the papers.  This is the leader of the most powerful country on earth. It's surreal.
Perfect illustration of why Trump is unfit for the presidency. He sees the world ONLY through the prism of his narcissism. He despises those who criticize him and is easily manipulated by those who praise him. The concept of morality has no meaning; only his wants are real.

oh yeah. no. family, love, friendships. all have equality. at that point it is the individual relationship that matters and even then some things trump that.
is such a spineless sycophant he won‚Äôt even attend negotiations for Americans. He gave up the Senate long ago to Trump. He‚Äôs so afraid of a presidential veto he has to have it ok‚Äôd first. The Senate can OVERRIDE a veto by 2/3, but you‚Äôll notice he‚Äôs NEVER done it.

From our leaders and now from this Trump guy that he chose to run the    It‚Äôs not the workers who are calling for this place to run this way, we want to serve and do the best for the American people. We need more voices on our side

We‚Äôre in the part of the election cycle where people who were always going to vote for Trump pretend they‚Äôd consider Biden if he would just pick the right VP!
I knew someone had been doing something... I had a feeling that close to voting time something had to  come out that an investigation would prove us right all along about the SOB in the WH!
We kinda do need him,Trump is about to send us back to the 50's lol
Yes because no matter what could come up couldn‚Äôt ever be worse than what Trump is on a daily basis.

Even though there was no bomb dropped tonight. Trump tossed out a few hints. Saying "if im around" this wasn't about the election. He knows he will win hands down. Bread crumbs folks. Follow along.
Nobody knows better than Trump that the overwhelming majority of his base is non college educated low information voters. I mean hell even the educated ones will tell you basic English words mean something entirely different than what a dictionary says.
This is amazing, but  has no intention of getting justice for her. He only listens to Mitch, Trump and Barr and they want no part of holding officers accountable. He is an embarrassment to our state and his position.
Biden is a better candidate than Donald Trump .
Trump has said worse lol
Trump reminds me of the article where reporters went into Eastern Ky in 2016 and interviewed people who wanted to keep their insurance under the Affordable Care Act but wanted Trump to get rid of Obamacare. They got quite a shock when they found out it was the same thing.
$1.5 trillion isn't the middle.  $2 trillion is, and they wouldn't be able to agree on it anyway.  Has Trump given up on the FBI building?
Well a vote against Biden is a vote from Trump. Lol
The ACA already does this. And tRump is in court trying to overturn it.  What an idiot he is.
Good Trump. Need more of this.
So.... Obamacare but not signed by a Black guy ?  Trump is desperate to steal everything from Obama‚Äôs legacy.

Trump talking about us!
I think #Trump just turned into a Democrat nominee during this press conference
When Donald J Trump got in office, he had to say "What the Hell" has been going on in the oval office?! He's lowered drug prices, and much more. There is no way to spell out all he's done in 1,000 tweets. Drugs, Jobs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, China, on and on!

He will have his ‚ÄúI Have Sinned,forgive me‚Äùspeech just like Daddy did. The ? Is will he do it just before the election so  daddy trump can welcome him back to the flock - he is the redeemer right?

Trump just said "hopefully if im still here"
Trump talks about "cities and states that have been in trouble for years of bad management," but neglects to realize that bad management is the fucking President of the United States. Deferring payroll taxes? I'm working. I don't need a deferral, kthx.
It wasn't the numerous scandals and crimes he committed, it was THIS. I really have to wonder how dedicated to anything republicans are.  Teacher‚Äôs viral essay shows how Trump‚Äôs COVID-19 failures are turning Republicans away from party
No way Joe Biden would have done a better job on the China Virus! Of course we'll never know. These jackass's like Juan Williams act like Joe would have done better. Does anyone truly believe a weak person is better at gettin' things done than a strong person. Is Trump! NO WAY!

Just like you did,  in 8 yrs VP and the other 35ish years? Yeah right and no thanks Joe. You've been key in establishing the swamp, over your many years. President Trump's done more for us and our great country in 3.5 yrs, than you've done, in over 40. Trump 2020!

The attacks on the Portland court house ended with a day or so of the House Committee meeting where Jim Jordan showed the 8-minute video of violent Antifa.  Soros must have told his minions that effort was counter-productive.  Trump was gaining more voters each day of the riots.

I have been praying that God would expose Jerry Falwell Jr for trading his dial for the (Satanic) GOP Trump lie! Now reduced to nothing more than a MAGAT Trump following NRA gun toting racist and hater! Traded his faith for Trump, I never dreamt God would actually ‚Äúexpose‚Äù him!
May God save us all from the Trump Virus!
You dont know what you‚Äôre talking about, there is just as much science to prove you wrong! you just want anything to destroy trump since you have absolutely nothing to offer America but hate!

How could you let the Courier Journal call you a Trump Democrat. You‚Äôd better explain yourself. Many of your supporters are angry about this.
Amy, I‚Äôve supported you all along, but the Courier Journal article is very disturbing. If you try to identify with Trump you will lose our support and the election. Trump will not win this election.
I believe it was in May? Plenty of time for negotiations to happen before everything expired. Mitch said it was dead on arrival and obviously Trump wants to look like the people's savior when he does sign executive orders. I hope most Americans know this game they are playing.
Trump gets more done in three days on the golf course than Nancy Pelosi has in her Life!
If he doesn‚Äôt win we are in big trouble as a country. Go Trump.
A pro Biden Republican makes sense but like you I've never heard of or met a pro Trump Democrat.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering people through the expansion, a much higher matching share than for low-income disabled and elderly people traditionally covered by Medicaid.
You really think he was a ‚Äúgood Christian‚Äù before he hooked up with Trump?   You are naive at best. Wake up, he is and was a slime-ball hypocrite, using the school as a cash cow for his lifestyle.
I do know there are plenty of Pro-Biden Republicans though. Don‚Äôt personally know of any pro trump democrats. We‚Äôve got better sense.
Twitter Democrats are deleting conservative followers from accounts and have been all damn day. Do something about these dishonest Democrat cheats President Trump because Democrats feel compelled to cheat and  can't win without cheating.
Booker is all class...McGrath is a pro Trump supporter. But fuck mitch so #SettleforAmy
She doesn‚Äôt praise Trump. You must be listening to Republican lies.

They just need the real estate to exist, so they can extract equity out of it when necessary.   This is also what many Russian oligarchs and mobsters did with Trump Tower. They bought a bunch of the condos for cash, Trump asked no questions, and they sat empty for years.
Hey Joy, the reason Trump is always trying 2 keep ppl focused on Lying about Joe Biden taken guns away, is because he's trying to cut SS, med, and Medicaid.  With the rest of his crooked party!!!
I think ‚Äúdisavowed‚Äù is a pretty strong word for what Trump said-  ‚ÄúStarted speaking very quickly‚Äù (FALSE) and  ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt happy‚Äù and  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to ask them.‚Äù  He didn‚Äôt mention ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù tho, so I guess it‚Äôs all good.
And the Trump campaign magically had a statement ready to go along with that ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù intel report that just happens to mention a potential Biden VP pick. Seems legit.
Rove is working with Trump to reprise this number. Not again, not ever.
I‚Äôm not gonna give them too much credit for their intelligence level either so yeah, we can stand back and watch. Hopefully from a safe distance like maybe a few hundred miles. I have not yet figured out why most bikers are Trump supporters. You talk about two different breedsü§™
And if you need any further proof that both sides Intel article drops with a Trump campaign statement ready to go, the Trump campaign statement just happens to mention a Biden front runner for VP.
Nah. Noose tightening for Obama and Hillary. Don't worry. Trump won't send them to Gitmo.
If only we had a president worthy of the office. My daddy once told me, "Never trust a man who lies". What ever happened to all those promises this president made?
I do like his Trump impressions but that's about as far as it goes for me. The daughter obviously an idiot lol
POST OFFICE !!   You are all dealing with LIVES here - many get meds by mail, voting can be done properly by mail (our ballots took over a week to move 5 miles).  IF there is an FBI or any defense money in there, Trump needs to rejoin the Democratic or Reform Party.

Trump won‚Äôt let them release election interference stuff unless they do the both sides thing. China has taken Trump to the woodshed and gave Ivanka and Jared a blank check. Please with that Trump campaign BS

Here is another one.
Democrats want to help government with relief funds from taxpayers. Trump would rather just help the American people with relief funds from taxpayers.
Buy American? tRump makes over $1 million from store that sells products with foreign, unknown origins
Executive order from Trump might be needed to help the individual American while avoiding local and state government bailouts for their past financial incompetences.
If you have to, would you wait in an 8 hour line to vote Biden in, to get Trump out?
Trump will give the American people a second stimulus whether Democrat lawmakers want to cooperate or not. Democrats want to bailout financially incompetent Mayors and Governors across the country.
Can someone please explain to me what a pro Trump Democrat is? Sounds like an oxymoron
China, if you are listening, release everything you have on trump!!!!
She had big money come in to support her during the primaries over Booker. It sure looks like from the outside looking in they stacked the deck. You either get a Trump enabler in McConnell or a Trump supporter in McGrath

The house has passed 230+ pieces of legislation in the last 1.5 years. But the way govt works is legislations needs to be passed by the house, senate and signed by the POTUS.   On the flip side, any thing that Trump and the republicans have passed couldn‚Äôt be done w/o the House

Kristen, Nancy was way more polite to you than I would have been.  Clearly she is exhausted responding to Trump tweets parroted and amplified by unimaginative reporters. It's not her job to defend Dems against GOP lies.  If I want to see GOP bothsidesisms, I'll watch Fox News.
I have to say that I have never been as proud of a president as I am of you. You are the greatest president we have ever had. I have your back. And so does the silent majority, and it is growing. God Bless You and your family. And God Bless The USA. TRUMP 2020üá∫üá∏

I can only assume that Trump has given up on having the best ratings in history and has decided to pursue the worst ratings in history. Gotta be remembered somehow, right?  A lot of my friends use wechat to communicate with their families across seas. This is horrible for them.

Trump once again blasphemous. So-called Christians, are you listening?

Agree. So sick of ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù being a prerequisite for the Presidency. That being said, the worst are these charlatans like Trump who profess to believe in the Christian ‚ÄúGod‚Äù only to pander to Christians. So tiresome.
I like what you guys are doing and want Trump gone, but let‚Äôs quit bringing religion into US politics. No place for it. I understand Trump brought it up with his dumb comments about Biden, but those don‚Äôt have to be addressed with affirmation of Biden being ‚Äúa devout Catholic.‚Äù

I‚Äôm sure he could find a job in the trump administration

You mean Trumps new Postal Service hire sucks and might cause issues on the election... you know the election that many are trying to make mail-in while Trump is also touting the risks of fraud...
Maybe someone should talk to Trump instead.
It‚Äôs the trump mentality which has infected the minds of his followers...it is so sad
I think he alienated our allies and made other terrible decisions to please Putin. The political decisions were definitely in favor if the Russians; trade, tariffs, NATO, military, nationalism, isolation from allies, virus. Our country is destroyed because of Trump and Putin!
Each of this vile videos is good for at least 10,000 new voters for Trump.

Donald Trump was predestined to be the greatest president that he is. God bless
Fact check: Biden wants to get rid of automatic weapons and better gun control policies. Trump is the president and has suppressed the 1st amendment. Trump is a pedophile.

Trump and everyone involved in this international crime syndicate needs to be prosecuted and held to account for selling out their country.
No way. No how. Getting rid of Trump will not solve the rot and corruption that has been in the making for at least 40 years. Trump is merely a symptom. He is mentally ill and being used by Putin and the Republicans at the top.
Trump said; "#BIDEN IS GOING TO HURT GOD!" It's time to remove this nut job from office #25thAmendment.
Is this really the best use of our Presidents time? With all that's going on related to #COVID19 Yes, normal leaders can multitask but not  Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
It has nothing to do with national security which is down the tubes anyway because of Cheetohead. This is all about Trump's reelection. I LOVE TikTok, it keeps me in touch with people and I see the real news live from the phones of TikTok-era. Has he blamed Obama for it yet?
I‚Äôve been encouraged by  approach to faith outreach so far.   They‚Äôve stressed the diversity of faith groups and not exclusively seen religious outreach as catering to conservative Christians.   This counter punch to Trump shows they‚Äôre willing to contest the God game.

Well, the Trump admin is more likely to employ these tactics so you are right to a degree.  Criminals and crooks will behave like criminals and crooks.
The Republicans controlling the WH and Senate have chained themselves to the canard that forcing people back to work by denying them support will bring the economy back thereby helping Trump, and themselves, to get re-elected. Odd idea given that dead people cannot vote.
Between Biden stridently opposing his own church's teaching on social issues and Trump saying Biden will "hurt God" (along with numerous other agitprop inanities) both are extraordinarily disqualified from being standard-bearers for the Christian faith.
Not an apology! That's called damage control and clearly wasn't written by him.  The man doesn't even know how to work text let alone the Twitters.  Trump does say some crazy stuff, but remind me how many decades did Trump spend in politics making empty promises?

Trump has gone to church once in the last year. By his own admission, he only attends church on Christmas and Easter or special occasions. While Trump is using tax payer money to enrich his golf courses on Sunday, Biden is in church. No Catholic should ever vote for him.

I‚Äôd agree with you if he didn‚Äôt just come up for air from saying that ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù if you vote for Trump. At this point it is clear that he a) takes the black vote for granted; and, b) judges a black person as legitimate or illegitimate based upon whether they vote for him.

Are you all being trite or trying to be cute, or sincerely just not attentive to realize that:  - Trump has a plan - Trump, his administration and Republican Governors have been implementing plan  - Trump and collaborators are achieving the desired results consistent with plan
So Trump is gonna ban TikTok before there‚Äôs a face mask mandate across the country where we have had over a million new cases in a just a few weeks. What a joke Trump is.
I'm starting to think that's the point. Maybe they are all Bannonites that just want to burn everything down.  That's clearly what Trump has been doing like.. forever.

I think many of MAGA know Trump is a failure and not the one they‚Äôd like in the position, but when faced with owning a bad choice and confirming to the left that they know he was a mistake, they would rather eat the shit sandwhich and smile before giving us the ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù.

I think I'd prefer no debates. Seems like that used to be a way to learn candidate positions but the internet allows us that info now. How is winning a debate important to being a good president? Trump v. Biden debate seems like an exercise in outrage/car crash porn for ratings.

It's fun that you and Trump have nicknamed each other Twitter and Facebook.
Is Trump ok?
Same.  That‚Äôs another 12 weeks of complete financial support, per the Trump Nazi party.
Ok, ok, one last thought today.  If we get Trump out of office and when the coronavius is under control, is it going to be like the Roarin' 20's?
Saw one where Trump leaves office, country is bankrupt
Trump's coronavirus claim leaves Anderson Cooper astonished  via
Let‚Äôs be fair.  Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Doug Collins, Jim Jordan and many others GOP enablers gave Trump the power to do it.  #MitchKillsSeniors #TrumpKillsSeniors
She must be Trump's auntie
That‚Äôs because the Democrats are working to help the people who have been most affected by Trump‚Äôs incompetence. On the other hand you, #MoscowMitch want to give employers unlimited power to flaunt safety and health issues, pump money to defense contractors and suppress voters.
NBC implicitly agrees with President Trump that Biden is "following the radical Left agenda" to "destroy your second amendment."
Can you tell me Y trump 2020?
And twice on Sunday while Biden is at church honoring God and Trump is on the golf course honoring himself.
He heard Trump say it cured coronavirus.
Our government never responds to any world disasters or national disasters since trump was elected
That's because Trump isn't a real Republican.
Say Wha....t, Trump University grad.!
OK, don't give Biden too much shit over his gaff about 'hispanics have all sorts of different issues/priorities, AAs don't'.  In many ways, he is kinda right. For example, the Cubans don't flat out hate trump, but most others do.  The entire AA population of the USA hates trump.
The hangman's noose awaits if Trump stays in office.  Barr and Durham will expose sedition and crimes against humanity on scale that will be hard to understand.  The Pentagon Pedophile task force has been hard at it for over 3 years.  Trump is serious about human trafficking.
I agree!  Biden thought he was being ‚Äúcute‚Äù - instead, he was crass and a bully.  If he‚Äôs not careful, he will become more obnoxious than Trump.  üò°
Ha! #RichMitch is almost as checked out of the COVID crisis as Trump is.  Spare me. üôÑ
'Nobody can find them': Trump admin has been expelling migrant kids without a trace, advocates say
'He still doesn't get it,' says Trump pandemic task force source as Trump spouts latest delusions
I am positive he doesn't know where Thailand is. Heck, he doesn't even know where his own States are located, what comprises Russia (or Soviet Union for Trump), or even what territories belong to the US.
This is an important ‚Å¶ essay about an ominous trend among some conservative intellectuals. Read it &amp; get ready for something potentially even more dangerous on the right post-Trump. Linker is one of the best columnists going.
Trump's Axios interview was impossibly bad at an impossibly bad political moment
on    After talking to women who don‚Äôt usually vote, found they are ‚Äúdesperate to vote‚Äù  cuz they  ‚Äúnever appreciated how much damage a president could do to their lives‚Äù  Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúsuburban housewives‚Äù aren‚Äôt as gullible as he thinks.  #LoserTrump
Cartoon: Trump re-election rally
If Trump wins it‚Äôs Joe Biden and the Democrats fault, not the people who didn‚Äôt vote.
Trump advisers hesitated to give military options and warned adversaries over fears he might start a war   #pray for our nation.
Pretty much Ky.  Look at Trump's margin in 2016.  That being said Dems in KY still outnumber GOP (registered voters).  Too strange.  To go Blue, we'll need a Bill Clinton type candidate at top of ticket and a hot issue like legalizing weed to get the kids out to vote.
Merkley: Postmaster general might be working with Trump in a 'form of election manipulation'
To those here who have to use this official announcement for your crass comments, the FDA is running this vaccine show. Trump is not a part of the FDA whatsoever. In fact, many of their personnel are holdovers from Dem administrations. Sit down.
Don't do it too soon. Save it for October for maximum political effect. Barr has one boss. President Trump. Get'er done Barr!
What I don't get in terms of strategy is Trump saying Biden is essentially suffered end-stage dementia and can barely speak. He sets the bar so low for Biden's debate performance, that when Biden does just fine, Biden will look like a stable genius. The strategy eludes me.
I'm white give me a good reason to vote for Trump
The silver lining of #Trump‚Äôs presidency is all the bigots exposing themselves, like the ones saying #Obama‚Äôs speech at #JohnLewis‚Äô funeral was disrespectful. If the people who were actually at the funeral didn‚Äôt have a problem with it, why do these people? Hint - bigots.
Fact check: This video was taken in Clyde Ohio before the incompetent handling of the Trump Virus. I'm pretty sure that many people in that crowd are either dead or not voting for Terrible Trump anymore. Anyone who botches a National emergency doesn't deserve to be our president.
Lol imagine if trump loses and in four years he runs again?
Ever since President Trump took office every Republican has been under fire. Democratic run cities and states are going to pot. The Dems let criminals run loose. Only cities that enforce our laws should get federal assistance, not those who have their police stand down.
A practicing Catholic retweeting from pillars of Christianity Rudy Giuliani, James Woods, and Donald Trump Jr.
Trump can‚Äôt afford it.
She could really use a bottle of Jack Daniels right now.  Imagine if Trump goes around congress and does a Executive Order about the stimulus?  Would Nancy have the stones to sue President Trump?  Giving Trump a ad where he can say "Nancy stopped me from giving you money"?
Exactly! Nobody cares but Trump and he will, ONCE AGAIN, just make a COLOSSAL ASS OUT OF HIMSELF! Might be entertaining but not worth it...
Trump‚Äôs god, is god of small things! And petty, just like trump is.

If God is so weak, ‚ÄúSleepy Joe Biden‚Äù can hurt your God, congratulations, your God is a Trump University / Trump Charity / Trump Casino / Trump Deferral / Trump Property Valuation / Trump Loan / Trump Dementia Test Result
The amount of people pretending that what he said wasn't wrong and racist is amazing. They either outright lie or immediately go to "Trump".  Black people are not a monolithic group. Individuality exists. He outright refuses to court the black vote.
Listen to the tears of parents as their children are killed by violence in your city and you do nothing but gripe about Trump
Yes and they are US REPUBLICAN SENATORS!! You don‚Äôt mind loading your pockets with tax cuts but don‚Äôt give anyone that lost their job bcuz of your fear of whatever Trump has on u to manage the ü¶†. You all should be chgd w/ CRIMES AGST HUMANITY! You are WORTHLESS !!
Joe Biden places American lives before tRump lies.
Trump ad portrays Biden as weak because he prays.   ‚ÄúI have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for that day.‚Äù - Abraham Lincoln
I also find it really odd that u believe should Trump get all the impossible and frankly racist things that he wants that the common man would be the beneficiary. Idk who told u that but it's a huge and bizarre leap of faith
Trump was not who Russia wanted elected in 2016.
Why aren‚Äôt you in talks with other congressmen trying to help all American citizens that are sucking wind right from your bosses trump virus? I know you really don‚Äôt give a shit unless it‚Äôs on tabloid fox ü§¨
Retweet if you, like me are not a Trump follower or supporter but you just follow him on twitter to laugh at the daily shit show.
I'm an atheist too and live my life closer to the values that Jesus espoused more than most Christians...certainly moreso than Trump.
Well then that's Trump for sure...well he never followed them to begin with but you get my point.
KY depends ENTIRELY on whether we have vote by mail &amp; how much Mitch feels like distancing himself from Trump.  Trump has no infrastructure in KY, it's all Mitch's machine.
Show us your Trump Swimsuit.üòÇ
Crazy part is...Trump doesn‚Äôt know that. He just thinks saying Biden hates the Bible will excite his Evangelical base. But he doesn‚Äôt completely understand why.
So am I!  Other Presidents had ethics!  Trump has no shame!
How many Hispanics did Trump interview for VP? How many Hispanic judges has he appointed? How many Hispanic people has he hired in his administration?
Trump golf on Sunday mornings!
Trump play golf on Sunday mornings!
Trump does not care!
That IS common knowledge.  The other day somebody asked, ‚Äúwhat if trump resigned on a condition that he will not be prosecuted?‚Äù And each and every response was basically, ‚Äúwhat the hell kind of q is that? Absolutely not.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think it was a coincidence that the q was raised.
Biden will mop the floor with the Trump during the debates. I can‚Äôt wait for the debates to begin. Dementia Donnie will not be able to keep up, as his last 2 interviews were evident. How much you wanna bet Trump will bow out of the debates come election time? He‚Äôs such a coward.
NRA President:  You are a liar and gaslighter just like Trump, they investigated the money üí∞ trail you bozo, overwhelming evidence of money laundering! You should be in prison!

Trump is a disgrace
Even though Kentucky is not considered a battleground State for Trump (red), it is when it comes to the Senate with  and Moscow Mitch! Help where you can! #VoteBlue2020
They are embarrassed to support trump and want to appear concerned about what he is doing. They say they won't vote for him again, but they are obviously looking for an excuse. Biden's VP choice is a deal breaker? Seriously? Just shut up and vote trump. Biden doesn't need you.
That‚Äôs so kind of Trump to buy Biden a new plane.
tRump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
It's one thing that baffles me no matter your political leaning. Is Trump even religious at all?
When Trump fakes like he knows the Bible, he sounds like Clark Griswold giving Aunt Edna's eulogy.
Biden goes to church, Trump plays golf on Sundays!
The governor of Ohio tested positive for #COVID__19 right before a scheduled visit with Trump. 1. I‚Äôm sorry that this has happened to him, and I wish him a speedy recovery. 2. For Jesus‚Äô sake, don‚Äôt cancel the trip!
If you side with Trump, you are wrong. You are in his 38% cult group. You are just as delusional as your dear leader. People outside of your circle, don‚Äôt take you seriously.
The Twilight Zone.          'He'll get us back on our feet': Trump supporters in Kentucky stick by him despite Covid-19 surge

üòÜ Melania doesn‚Äôt sleep üõè with Trump, they sleep in separate beds.  It might be just a rumor, but I also heard she sleeps on the second floor since she knows Trump experiences difficulty with stairs.
Thigh-land. Yo-Semite. Donald Trump questions Joe Biden‚Äôs mind?! Lol. #TrumpDeathToll160K #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TraitorTrump
Trump is projecting onto Biden what is true about his satanic self! Trump is an enemy of God!
OH FFS! They've been investigated! By the FBI, largely due to the Steve Bannon-produced "Clinton Cash!"
Facebook has deleted a post by President Donald Trump for the first time, saying it violated its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.
Will Putin turn over a COVID-19 vaccine to Trump just before November 3?
Thumbing through my Bible, looking for the section where God is pro-guns.  Not sure I can find that...but it doesn't take long to find where Trump attacked a church with guns and tear gas.
Wouldn't it be fun if Biden could time his announcement of his VP to step on Trump's latest effort to be the Total Focus of news cycle.
There's a lot of evidence of Trump's complicity with Russia. He promised us he'd make his taxes public. Has that happened?
Well done response to Trump‚Äôs stupid House Of Cards meme
4/ While I grieve their departure from orthodox Christanity, I think there must be more to their departure than than evangelical of Donald Trump.   Being disappointed in the hypocrisy of  leaders and friends is one thing. Rejecting the Gospel message and its ethics are another
Not all of us. I‚Äôve never voted for McConnell even when he was running for local positions. I also never voted for a Trump. He‚Äôs an insult to intelligent people.
Idk why you like trump so bad do you not see what‚Äôs going on now in 2020 if he had a real plan the situation would‚Äôve been much better
But if they suppprted tRump, it does...
So....trump is a agent of Russia with no proof...proven made up lie and I didn‚Äôt feel the outrage from ya there...now an outrageous statement against Biden and here comes the critique...doesn‚Äôt seem 50/50 there
Trump‚Äôs real superpower is that he never gets tired of his own bullshit.  Any rational person with nominal integrity would eventually wear down under the weight of it.
That statement is the psychiatric definition of projection.  Good grief, Trump is the poster child of projection to the point of being laughable, if not pathetic.  America knows better
Vader definitely a Trump guy.
3/ who reject the historic Christian ethics, taught by Jesus himself, on issues of sexuality, the sanctity of human life, and the totality of how to best love your neighbor.   In their moral reasoning, any support for Trump is written off as syncretism with Christian Nationalism
I just can‚Äôt fathom why the Trump campaign would want to make cognitive ability a center piece. The blind narcissism of these people is unreal
Fra-gee-lay. Like Trump's ego!
is the only one in th US who doesn't know Joe is a practicing Catholic.  trump* is a moron  *impeached
Oh yeah Jesus would have been a total fan of Pence and Trump. Especially the putting families in cages, separating children from their parents and making fun of invalids.
Facebook bans ads from pro-Trump PAC
it was not his job (NSC not NSA). he was incoming, as you admit. he was freelancing without any legal authority to do so because trump had not been sworn in. 50USC3021 C&amp;B filed the paperwork AFTER he was busted as an unregistered lobbyist He (freely) pleaded GUILTY-twice!
If Team Trump/Pence, had been a competent American team, we would have had Rapid Testing, running like a well oiled machine.  We wouldn't  be worrying about workers, &amp; schools opening.  Team Trump/Pence shot an air ball. Now it's our turn to make a 3 pointer.
You can thank the new postmaster general, appointed by Trump for that.
Dissection of a Trump speach: 1) Reads from teleprompter = flat inflection, run-on sentences, frequent mispronunciations. 2) Ad-libs = crazy-speak in conspiratorial tones.  Dissection of the audience: 1) There bc F'ing crazy, 2) held captive by employer, or 3) is a reporter.
You made your choices. Your party will forever be the party of trump.
One of the cable pundits said with Trump it‚Äôs either confession or projection. He combines both in this rant.
FALSE
FALSE
Trump has a lower body count but yes.
Then you got it with Trump brother
The disparities between overall leads and handling of specific issues in this poll across the board are  ~ fascinating ~ It has Trump underwater on handling of coronavirus in South Carolina (!), yet he will not have to make a single swing through SC to win there by double digits
Never Trump means you are not welcome. GFY
A particularly interesting part of this poll:  is polling 3 points higher than  among Kentucky voters in who they think would do a better job addressing racial inequality.  Trump leads Biden by 9 points in this poll and won Kentucky in 2016 by ~30 points.
maybe trump will do it~~~
So Trump just announced in his speech in Ohio that Biden is against God. I'm voting for Biden because Trump is the Antichrist.
between this and trump we really have no hope
"it is what it is." - Trump
A threat? I said I was voting for her. I just pointed out that many Booker people as well as myself despise Donald Trump and being a pro Trump Democrat makes ZERO sense. I also pointed out that if this is a strategy and she doesnt indeed like Trump it's a losing strategy.
Trump seems to be doing well
To me it means never republican who supports trump #WeWillVote
So threats is what you think will sway Booker voters over to McGrath? I guess that is very pro Trump like. I'd be interested in what BS Booker people spout as well.
Who died and made Trump, Lord God? Eh, Dementia Don?!
The Great Amish American's will vote for President Trump! By the way, they don't have phones to participate in these phony polls.  üá∫üá≤ü¶ÖüóΩüêò!
BTW voting for anyone other than HRC was a vote for Trump. So all y'all purity test mother fuckers need to own this too.
Biden could have this election in his back pocket if he just had other people talking for him. Ditto for Trump smh. How many times are we going to allow both to insult our intelligence? #Independent #freethinker

Yes. Her nonsensical Hillary Hate helped elect Trump in 2016

I MEAN GUYS C'MON NOW!! But yet   is racist when he is clearly trying to help EVERYONE brown, white, yellow, etc. whatever color you want to be!!!  says racist things everyday!! If you're an American TRUMP is the clear choice!!
No Sean, that's Trump's shit you're smelling. It's on your nose.
Absolute devotion to Donald J. Trump.
Don‚Äôt worry. By handicapping the corrupt NRA, Trump and GOP are taken cate of.
Trump thinks you are a weakling.
not only did Trump go there but there is a gazillion pics...he wished Ghislaine well...TWICE....the second time he doubled down on HOW WELL he wishes this pedophile....he is a pervert who was accused of raping a 13 yr old girl with Epstein. She was scared into silence....
I think we all know what trump was proposing, allowing local authorities to discriminate against projects that wished to build in 'affluent' neighborhoods. Obama banned such zoning, which is fully in line with what libertarians believe.  Trump likes the statist rules states used.
The only time tRump finds the Bible. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Trump responds that he has aborted dozens of his own kids, and he doesn't think his lack of faith helped him at all.
Biden was against abortion before tRump ever was.
You hate trump bhe speeks the truth kids are immune to covid we know people that are 60 above are more likely to get it the older your are the closer the death you are the more sick as you age thats fact stop the bull tell the truth
Trump once again demonstrates his mastery of the Christian faith by claiming his devout Catholic political opponent has the ability to ‚Äúhurt God.‚Äù
You must mean Trump. He‚Äôs the one that was given a cognitive test. No one believes he‚Äôs all there mentally. Listen to how he talks and looks.
You must mean Trump. He‚Äôs the one who did that.
Many people are rightly mocking Trump for claiming Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God."   But instead of criticizing Trump, let's ask ourselves: How will we help God today by being co-creators of the just world that God envisions for us?
I just finished watching The Loudest Voice on Showtime...they showed some footage of Trump in 2016, while he was never a great orator, he was Abe Lincoln back then compared to the word salad he is now. Plus he looked 20 years younger.
Trump is insane
Fearing covid and missed classes, many parents prefer mixing online and in-person school, poll finds
there are just as many pics of Trump with Epstein....also Trump is also on the flight logs to pedo island...but the right LOVES to ignore that fact..... Clinton AND Trump are both disgusting....they can both go to jail
Kentuckians have also wanted Moscow Mitch for years to correct? No one said Kentuckians were a bright group. My point has always been if McGrath would denounce her love or whatever it is of Trump publicly and loudly I think more Booker people would be on board.
What‚Äôs up with trending today? Trump and Clinton foundation? Michelle Obama is lowkey depressed? NY AG is trying to dissolve the NRA? Voting Rights Act? Haven‚Äôt even looked at that trendü§≠. This is most certainly NOT a normal day on twitter!
u see wat happened to kaepüòêi would be scared too if everything i ever worked for could be taken from me that quick. i promise you any NFL player would a wear a shirt goin against trump or whoever
Here's the thing  To Trump,  Trump = God  So yeah, from a certain perspective, he might be right.
This may sound different to GOP Trumpers.  But to me, it sounds like Trump's gurgling as he's circling the drain, gasping his last breath.  The stench of his fear and desperation nauseating.
why is he complimenting trump like this
my guess is husband won't be grabbing her pussy any time soon.   sex in the age of Trump
I only take issue in the implication that Trump Administration is somehow entirely to blame. Money does not equal immunity to "low grade depression". Lots of money can stave off complete misery.
we deadass gotta choose between him and trump
. facilities are COVID Hotbeds yet  just increased its shares in the company by 1000%
True! When President Trump first started talking about the China Virus, he was told that the Governer's were responsible for handling the outbreak in their states. Now the media is trying to make him look responsible for every death. Nursing homes had the most loss! Cuomo?
I‚Äôll see your bumbling Trump and raise you one stumbling Joe.     Furthering my point that we are all, every single one of us, screwed.
The positive test for the coronavirus just ahead a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.
My brother lives in Ohio, big believer in Trump, we no longer speak...I cannot imagine him in a mask...üò°
unfortunately it's no joke.  testing is great for trump.  trump is only interested in his own fat ass but if you're a regular joe schmo (ie, American citizen), you're on your own
A Biden / Trump debate will sound like a bowl of spaghetti-o‚Äôs being read aloud
You're right.  That's Trump's charity is gone.
I am sure he meant ‚Äúmuch like‚Äù Even if he thinks that sentiment. He would not go on tv and say it. This election will be of old dudes who can‚Äôt read and misspeak a lot. The difference is Biden will surround himself with qualified people and not cronies like Trump.
You think Trump has a chance. That's too cute.
The far left appears determined to re-elect Trump. I say this as a progressive. My head is going to explode.
The Streets Are Quiet Again, Thanks To Trump-Barr Backing Down  The Feds Lost the Battle of Portland; the Secret Police Left Town and Nothing Bad Happened

Imagine the media reaction had Trump said this or if Trump had suggested a black interviewer might be a junkie.
Anyone else think that  should excommunicate trump or that just me
Recently there was news about Facebook taking down 4 major network of bots that were skewing the FB metrics on engagements/interactions towards Trump.  I did not see how this was factored in while reading your article. Would this have changed your analyses ?
Rasmussen has 36% of likely voters currently think Biden has dementia. And Biden is winning in their same polls. Think about what that says about Trump.
Anyone with integrity would simply say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt read the Bible. I‚Äôm not a Christian,‚Äù if the truth. So sick of people inserting Christianity into American politics like professed belief is a requirement to hold office.  If there was a benevolent God, would Trump exist? No.
Trump heads to Ohio as their governor gets the coronavirus
His widow told CNN that she penned the obituary blaming President Donald Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and those who do not wear masks because the pandemic hadn‚Äôt been taken seriously from the beginning and she wanted to ‚Äúput blame where it belonged.‚Äù

Where are these supposed Feds who are supposed to help? Trump is dragging ass
I am surprised Trump hasn't tried to take credit for this.America and the FBI was ready to close the file on General Flynn is being discussed in the US.

You really think 4 more years of trump will be good for the American people? He‚Äôs had 4 years to make America better and today America is in terrible shape. We‚Äôve trusted him to do the right thing and he‚Äôs continued to fail us. Not saying Biden is a saint. We just need change
This won‚Äôt be a conventional debate. It won‚Äôt be about Biden‚Äôs policies. It‚Äôs going to be about Trump defending HIS policies‚Äîhis very untenable policies‚ÄîAND his scandals. He has a record to defend now, &amp; it‚Äôs not a position he‚Äôs used to. I‚Äôm confident Biden can pull that thread.

White House Watch: Biden lengthens lead, finding that he does not need to take questions as his strategists suggests. It is truly Trump vs. Trump.
Obama, Trump and hypothetically Biden are not the actual rulers of this country. They're just the public spokesperson.  The actual rulers are the ones who write their checks. And they write checks to both parties.  All of them serve capital.
Obama hired Hillary?? Am I mistaken? Obama hired Joe Biden. Biden hired Harris. By your logic I can easily Obama and Biden are shit.
Stop this nonsense, you're pretending as if  Biden is running away from the media. They know where to get Biden if they want ask him any questions. Biden is not Hillary Clinton and he has been in politics for decades and he is master of the game.

Meanwhile, Biden is still in his basement.
This fool talking about "its an honor to run against you" like he's a legit candidate. Boy if you don't go somewhere and sit your disrespectful self down somewhere. How bout you fix your marriage and let Biden/Harris worry about fixing the country!
Guns scare tactics? Nope, Biden and Cammy have both stated they will confiscate many, if not all guns. If you want to join them and repeal the second amendment, then find 38 states to approve a change in the Constitution.  The big scare will be their policies

The armed protestors never destroyed anything(that I know of). The governor mandates are illegal as not approved by congressional body - governors aren‚Äôt kings. You just deflected my comment. Harris/Biden do not stand for law and order and encourage destruction of property
No US president has ever been punished for their crimes. Maybe President Warren would have bucked that trend, but Biden? There's no way he'd do something that the GOP could spin as nakedly partisan and uncivil.

Hopefully our county will be blessed with a president of deep faith in January 2021 when VP Biden replaces the creature that currently occupies the White House.
Could we just hold off on the whole let‚Äòs force Biden to fix everything that Trump didn‚Äôt do or he‚Äôs not taking it seriously? It would be nice to have daily briefings but that should be pretty far down the list of priorities
I was a huge Biden fan (I voted for him over Obama in the primaries Bain 2008üòÜ) I‚Äôm dismayed by several aspects of his personality and him being our candidate when we had so many other options...it felt predetermined. He will be a fine leader though and better than this hell.

We quite literally will not survive as a nation under Trump. We have already lost what once made us great. Joe Biden will rebuild America from the disaster Trump has created.
I‚Äôm in backwoods, OH and just saw a Black Lives Matter and Biden Harris sign in somebody‚Äôs yard and it really Made my heart smile.
Uh we know Biden is basicallyretarded now.  So, yeah walking and talking are two very different things. If only Biden could talk as well as he rides his little stupid bike. Unfortunately we know if he rides like he talks, he crashes, A LOT
Just tired of the young hopeful progressives getting excited about Kamala putting Pronouns in her Twitter bio and Joe Biden talking about Medicare for all. They don't know yet that they're about to be completely disappointed once their position is abandoned for something easier.
You don't think Ups/ FedEx benefit from the USPS being defunded. Statistics show that trump voters are more likely to vote in person in the pandemic than Biden voters. Do you really wanna pay 4-6x more with FedEx and ups. Also USPS pay workers way better
Michelle Obama to go to bat for Biden
Instead of voter shaming you should probably give me reasons why to vote for war criminal Biden.
Just a guess.. President Donald Trump donated to Kamala Harris' California AG campaign. 10 years later he‚Äôs throwing a temper tantrum because 1) Biden / Harris ticket wins in November 2) assumes money buys loyalty 3) Harris will eviserate Pence in VP debate..
Oddly after the court decision we hear that she's interested in the Biden administration üò≥.  Oh dear God üôè we don't want that.

Here's What Rush Limbaugh Says Joe Biden's Mask Mandate is Really All About
üíØ   Senator Harris was my first pick for Pres.  I‚Äôm still peeved that she was out so early in the run.  My hope is she is VP for a term, makes it clear she‚Äôs better as Pres, and Biden steps aside for her to run in 2024.
Wrong. I can clearly give you what Trump is running for - lower taxes, deregulation, finish the wall, pro-life, conservative judges, etc. Biden is running for gun control (confiscation), abortion on demand, green new deal, and of course ‚Äúanti-Trump.‚Äù
Do you desire to fight Covid 19 as Americans have always met and defeated every challenge or do you desire to shrink from this latest challenge by hiding in the basement wearing a mask and face shield muttering inane platitudes... Trump v Biden..  With whom do you stand..??..üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
No need to mandate everyone when not all areas are as hard hit. That's like giving everyone a band-aid when only one person has a cut. Plus, didn't we try that already by shutting down the whole country? Biden must have forgotten! Signs of things to come if he is elected.
That it is. Biden would likely die or become incapacitated in office. Then Kamala Harris is in charge.  God help us!

No matter what you republicans TRY to pin on Biden I will Vote for him.  Trump is the biggest criminal and liar that ever walked on this earth.
I really do feel bad for you, Jeff. Your blind faith towards this President that makes him immune to criticism in your eyes would make our founding fathers weep. Trump has sold out American workers and Biden‚Äôs union backing is clear of that.

Powerful question. Why are Harris and Biden running, almost literally, away from any media questions ? Why are they frightened? Will they finally agree to take questions from the media if they can get the questions in advance? If they can have time to prepare the answers for Joe?

Joe Biden can shoot someone in the leg, send the military to shoot protestors, send people to prison for weed with Kamala sending parents to prison for truancy while becoming an authoritarian dictator and I'd still vote for Joe Biden over Cheeto. Either vote Joe or you're Hitler.

As a retired carrier, I ask ALL postal employees to support and vote for Joe Biden. Joe has always supported the postal employees. Joe has ALWAYS had the support of the Firefighters Union. He is one of us. Can you HONESTLY say that about Trump???????????? No you can't!!

No, what I‚Äôm saying is that with a 7-2 far right Supreme Court, $15 minimum wage is impossible for a generation.  Even if Biden doesn‚Äôt get it done, you can primary him from the left in 2024 and get it done then.
As a retired letter carrier, I ask my brothers and sisters to fully support the Biden/ Harris team. For YEARS we have heard that the GOP wanted to privatise the PO. That time has arrived. Your jobs REALLY do depend on removing Trump from office. Vote Dem on Nov 3rd.

Biden definitely, completely picked a female VP.  People voted for Trump because they hated Clinton... "it's a man's job" was a terrible terrible excuse so they didn't have to explain why they didn't like Hillary.

Personal opinion on the Biden VP saga: His team screwed it up from the start. There‚Äôs no way for him to make a pick that unifies factions. The roll out is botched before it starts. It‚Äôs lose-lose for him. He doesn‚Äôt have savvy people doing this. Beats me as to why that is.

I think the challenge may be running as a sitting VP.  Does she leave herself room to pivot from Biden in certain areas - if she needs it?  Also, she is a formidable candidate, but not a great campaigner - see 2016.  She will have to figure that out in the next couple of years.

If anyone thinks voting Biden is going to save America, they're the problem.
Yes. Many have argued that Biden is more likely to be influenced by direct action than Trump, and so you have to vote for Biden, etc.  They fail to grasp that regardless of who's in power, the only way to influence people who only care about money is to attack their money.
I love how the people who demand you vote for Joe Biden also argue that the only way to get what needs to be done done is by direct action, but under Biden.  I wish they spent half the energy they do voter shaming on actually organizing direct action instead...
Why does the CA ballot have ‚ÄúVice President Joseph Biden‚Äù?  Shouldn‚Äôt it be either ‚ÄúFORMER Vice President‚Äù OR ‚ÄúSenator‚Äù since there is only 1 VP? Any protocol experts  out there?
I believe Biden wasn‚Äôt among the options to choose from in that poll.
Wait I thought Biden was dementia king
As long as Kamala keeps talking about him I am sure he won‚Äôt let her accusations go unanswered. Plus if Biden gets elected he won‚Äôt be there for long. I think the dems know that. He is just a prop.
Frida.  The point is Biden has 40 years for experience.  Trump can‚Äôt even win an Emmy for his reality TV show.   63% of Americans can understand this basic concept.
He has threatened to block every bill if Biden wins. So what else is new?
Smart move by both Biden and Buttigieg.    Pete resonated in Iowa, and gets to keep his name out there, and Biden can take advantage of Pete's good-will in the community.
Has anyone had more practice running for President since Henry Clay than Joe Biden?
I haven‚Äôt seen the numbers but maybe more people voted for Trump than Biden is because of all the other candidates on the Democratic ticket. A lot of people still voted for who they liked white T got all the Rep votes. What were the totals? D vs R?
don't think that aoc needs your help.  in fact you would be more helpful in helping  organize a strike, or being a high profile proxy to  and defend her by calling out joe biden.  those are two things that you could do to reach out to progressives.
Agreed and if Biden steals the election I have a feeling that the country will be split wide open and we‚Äôll see riots and major properties of major cities burned to the ground. Most people are unwilling to live under communism, real or perceived.

Are you really sure? And when they do, what kinds of questions will be asked? I assume you've seen the few times Mr. Biden has been questioned it's been mostly softball. Not to mention, there's been a document released from the dem party with a "how to" question Ms. Harris.

Biden finally comes up with a proposal that  hasn't already done. And its, drum roll please, to force everyone everywhere to wear a mask when alone.  He sees us as his choldren, except we dont get the graft. #leftylies

I also feel the need to clarify that my original tweet isn't equating a third party vote with a vote for Trump. I'm specifically referencing the people who are choosing not to vote, or choosing to vote for Trump just because they don't like Biden.
Trump supporters aren't worried about Biden.. just like they didn't worry about Hillary. The democratic party in a civil war would be funny.. clueless adults (kids) that have yet to grow up..
So Biden paired with a more liberal Congress is going to be a lot better for the country than Trump with any kind of Congress.
That's an understandable opinion, but that's not really what I was going for with my tweet. Biden sucks, yes, but Trump poses an active threat to the lives of many. Being able to ignore that because you don't like Biden is a position of privilege.
I made a thread on why I ultimately decided to support Biden, if you haven‚Äôt read it.

I still think Biden is going to win big, but Biden is definitely doing everything he can to cost himself the  election so I'm not as certain now.

MAJOR coup for Nancy Pelosi, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerburg......a slap in the face to the Clintons and Obamas (they needed Rice as vp).  Biden will resign within six months and Harris will be President with Pelosi as the puppet master.

And no moral principles. Colbert cornered her on her vicious racist smears on Biden. Her answer? "It was a debate, it's what you do." This is Matt's use of a good VP?
Stacy Abrams has stated she will still accept the nomination for VP, giving Biden an out if Kamala gets upset with him sniffing her hair
I cant wait to tweet Biden and Harris WIN!
Well with Biden you never know. Ok, you do always know.
It'll be so much better when President Joe Biden is the one you see walking in.
Not sure I had any "hopes" with Biden. It's more that in the midst of a national reckoning with police violence and mass incarceration we have a lifelong prosecutor in the VP slot.
Wish we had Biden of '08 of the VP debate against Palin.
Just in case you're out there thinking about writing how "dems just aren't excited about her" I AM FUCKING ECSTATIC ABOUT THIS VP PICK
Hillary was always within the margin or error, Biden is not.  I know you won't understand this but there is a big difference.
Trump is ridiculous.  He calls a church going Biden, a man who "is against God."   Plain stupidity.
so  do you still believe that biden is a racist, and do you believe the women who have called him out for being a creep? #Metoo ?
Latest polling indicates 20% of respondents say they‚Äôve NEVER heard of Biden VP pick Sen Kamala Harris. That‚Äôs more than 60 million Americans üò≥ think  about  that  for  a  minute ü§î #KamalaHarrisForVP
Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris is kind of like the halftime show where people jump off trampolines
I really hope there was some kind of sophisticated political calculus behind Biden's pick of Harris for VP, because I am having a hard time figuring out which relevant swing voters she is supposed to attract.
I‚Äôm a voting ass dude so Biden will get my vote but damn I will be dragging my ass to the ballot.
I love Bernie but I hate when he puts the nation before his progressive agenda. We know you ain‚Äôt for this Biden shit.
I'm so excited! Biden &amp; Harris can make America America again.
Agreed ... once Biden took over the race, this was the most likely outcome
If Trump loses, GOP recalibrates, looks for someone who didn‚Äôt go full #MAGA. (Mitt Romney will be as old as Biden is today...)  If Biden loses, Harris joins Kaine, Ryan, Palin, Edwards, Lieberman, Kemp, Stockdale, Bentsen and Ferraro as losing VP candidates never seen again.
Anyone not bothered by Trump's grotesque mishandling of the COVID-19 epidemic, his racism, criminal acts, childish behavior etc. isn't going to care one iota about who Biden chose for his VP.
This Dem is sad and disappointed. Warren was the one. Harris is ok but she does not excite me. Biden made the safe, predictable choice.
1) UK will have maybe their best team in decades, if not ever. If we we were ever going to do something funky with Ohio State do it now. Why not?  2) Not my first choice but I have no issue voting for a Biden/Harris ticket. Sign me up.
She stated publicly that she believes Biden's sexual assault accusers, and called him a 'vile racist' on a national stage one year ago.ü§¶üòÇ
Did Joe Biden ask #Copmala to get that work done to her face? Was it not sniff worthy for him?
But you said you prefer action, a Biden Harris admin will take actions to stop the exact abuses that Harris committed! Another Trump admin won‚Äôt
Harris was a pretty easy choice for Biden. There was tons written in 2016 that decreased African-American turnout cost Hillary. If you think Harris will boost that number she totally makes sense. Biden and team guessing record won't matter. Right? Who knows. But not a crazy pick.
BIDEN READ THE ROOM BITCH
Bet? I'm all in Biden wins. I'll give you odds.
Alot of people on the left don't like it because they want another Bernie-esque person to be VP, they want further progressive. I like the pick, I felt Biden needed a heavy hitter and more well known candidate than Rice (more baggage) and Bass.  Also Kamala going to shred Pence.
With prison/police/court reform being at the forefront of America right now, Biden could not have picked a worst candidate.
My first pick over Biden!
YAHOO!  Congratulations!  Great pick,  !!!! BIDEN/HARRIS2020

Biden‚Äôs VP could be a newborn kitten and I would still vote for them
I would not. I dont think all that highly of Biden. I believe the DNC picked the worst possible person
Remember, Republicans are helping West try to get on the ballot - in order to drain votes from Biden.
Unfortunately young progressives already busy bashing Biden. At a guess will be equally harsh or worse with VP. I wldn't have picked Biden either but I get how it works. So will support him &amp; whichever running mate. And I'd like to smack the next one who "okay boomer"s me...
Why didn‚Äôt we just nominate a strong woman (person of color or not) for the top of our party‚Äôs ticket in the first place?!?! Threatening Biden over his VP pick now isn‚Äôt a good look. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Joe Biden will announce his VP pick soon... üôÑ yeah I haven‚Äôt heard that lie for weeks. #BasementBiden   The only way Trump loses the elections is if the democrats get away with cheating and stealing it away from the people. #Trump2020
Is Biden really gonna pick Cameltoe Harris as a running mate? üòé  I meant Kamala!
And Biden is impaired? Give. Me. A. Break.
The Clintons left office in debt because of all the costs associated with the blue dress scandal. They wrote books.   Obamas wrote best seller books and had speaking engagements  Biden has been frugal with his money, and has pensions associated with his public service.
I feel like there are better options than Bill. Also noteable would be R‚Äôs for Biden.

If by some miracle the election happens and Joe Biden wins and Trump transitions out of office peacefully, January 22nd 2021 99% of the "#Resistance" goes back to not giving a fuck about kids in cages forever wars police brutality wealth inequality etc etc.
It's not goofy things alone. But it's visual decline. Nobody can look at him and say he is as good now as he was 4 years ago and that's fine. But he starts at such a lower cognitive spot than Biden so his decline is markedly worse.
Again, I dont disagree. Anyone at that age is not better with time. But again, comparing Biden to Trump when it comes to cognitive decline is not an argument you want to be making if you are Trump. Biden starts from a higher point and Trump's decline is visually measurable.
I would disagree but to compare any level of cognitive decline between Biden and Trump is not an argument I'd want if I were Trump.
The hill this goes down has a much deeper and much worse end for Trump than for Biden. We all know this.
So you are attributing to Biden  what is apparent in trump.

You keep missing the disconnect between the poll ##s on how many want medicare4all, etc &amp; how they actually voted in primary. Biden wldn't be the candidate if they voted as if those things mattered.
I hope you're right and they give Biden a huge and resounding victory, but there are still a disturbing number of Trumplodytes who are satisfied as long as someone pisses off Libs &amp; appoints anti-abortion judges.  If so, the Country, Constitution &amp; everything else can go to Hell.
It is simply a push back against ignorant Trump cultists who claim Trump is physically and cognitively superior to Biden. Trump a physical slob and intellectually worse.

Go look up Biden's history, especially with race. Ask why he can say Black parents want to take care of their kids they just don't quite no what to do and he would put social workers in their homes in the 2nd primary debate and no one says anything about it.
With a foreign power. Shut out your bias as best you can and explore things. Calling politicians liars has no meaning because they all lie. Biden is a liar. Trump lies. Stop looking at the personalities. Look at legislation. Majority of Dems voted for all Trump's legislative.
Do you not remember when Trump banned travel from China Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and encouraged everyone to come on out because it was safe. They said Trump was racist to stop travel from China. Remember Biden encouraging everyone to go vote in Florida. Poll workers sick.

For every one you‚Äôve got of Biden, we have a hundred for Trump.
Trump doesn't want Mail In voting to happen, because he knows that more people will be able to vote that way, and a larger turnout is typically better for Democratic candidates (Joe Biden in this case). He can't say that though, so instead he's claiming that it'll lead to fraud.

So like I said, I‚Äôm not going to vote for trump. But Biden has done nothing to try and get any part of me to vote for him. He himself has already bred hate into his message when he said you ain‚Äôt black if you don‚Äôt vote for him. He said he has no sympathy for my generation.
Well I‚Äôve lost faith in this country years ago. It‚Äôs obvious it isn‚Äôt working, look at the pain in the country. Trump is only making the weaknesses more apparent as he actively tries to make everything worse. I‚Äôd say by them pushing Biden, it secured my doubt in the Dem party.

How many more is he going to magically scrape from his pool of voters? And think of all the ones he‚Äôs lost already. Think of the Republicans and independents who voted for him in 2016, who are going public that they will vote for Biden. Your candidate is in trouble.
Biden isn't even campaigning. His surrogates aren't doing anything either. I live in a purple town that leans heavily blue. I haven't seen one sign or sticker for Biden. Not one. Trump wins in a landslide.
Right so why is Biden advocating for a national mask mandate that makes no sense for large parts of the country?
So the new strategy is to congratulate leftists for getting Kamala Harris on the ticket (????) by pretending that ‚Äúclose to M4A‚Äù is progressive and invoking the GND (which Biden, the presidential candidate with fossil fuel execs on his team, still opposes)
I‚Äôve seen thousands of Trump flags....still haven‚Äôt seen a Biden flag....
You mean: Trump plans to hit Biden in the only way he thinks he can as a last resort.
I definitely don‚Äôt like Trump. Kamala might secure the win for Biden though.
There is zero chance I will vote for Biden, because his record is an abomination to anyone who supports consent, is anti war, and stands firmly with defunding the police.
Can Trump be removed from office as soon as he gets voted out?  What would need to happen for Biden to take over immediately?
Rump could have lawyers intervene to try to deny extensions but I don't see his lawyers succeeding. They can also intervene in the case of close votes and recounts, or if there is provable major fraud. As long as we give Biden a blowout victory, Rump is toast.
Because lies are all Republicans got.

Hating poor people and letting them die is literally Biden's entire record, but go off.  This is a weird defense a New Jim Crow segregationist.
That‚Äôs the best you could do?? 1975. Biden made racist comments literally 7 days ago. Not to mention his long long history of same.
Perhaps, because, at that moment, she had center stage &amp; his mind was on what she's saying? It's called respect...dignity...INTEGRITY. I knew at the outset "a certain class of people" would see an opp to try to make Biden look bad. But Truth Will Always Be Stronger Than Lies
I‚Äôm really annoyed with the lefts stance of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt publicly question Biden/Harris until after they are elected!‚Äù  What? That‚Äôs how bad our democracy is now?
Right. Trump &amp; Biden are both shitty but a third party candidate has no chance of winning.
Actually, Biden is a well-educated gentleman with a law degree (not to mention a serious christian upbringing). Trump was a mediocre student outstanding only by virtue of his mediocrity. Biden stays mentally active  but Trump, morbidly obese, his mouth is his most active quality.
I am so ready for you to be Biden's AG and charge him.
yeah good luck getting biden to pass m4a. good luck abolishing capitalism from within capitalism (the only way to possibly divert the climate crisis). also love the just straight up right wing bullshit ‚Äòcommunists have no job‚Äô that‚Äôs literally 100% baseless...
They can't do it the next day.  But the longer Biden remains POTUS (shudder) the bigger danger he becomes.  This moron with the nuclear football?  He could flashback to the cuban missile crisis and launch.
Look people who never voted before have registered to vote. Droves of Republicans are leaving the party &amp; are voting for Biden. Trump has disenfranchised millions &amp; millions of Americans. They are ready to vote like never before. Unless Russia performs a miracle DT won‚Äôt win.

Excellent, as usual. The Harris pick by Biden did nothing to change my mind about who to vote for. It's still 3rd party for me.

High praise Rick. Your  blazed the trail for more and more talented, media savvy compatriots to join the fight. I'm glad the Biden campaign has found some top-shelf SocMed talent.
If progressives/leftists are not voting Biden, I wonder if they realize you can't seriously push progressive priorities in a crumbled nation that would result after four more years of Trump. Nobody will be talking #MedicareForAll while fending off fascist hit squads (e.g.).

Did Harris get Biden fired from the television show that he created? It's a lot easier to forgive a few mean words in a debate than that.  Besides, it's a tweet, he's not standing outside the guys house challenging him to a duel. Don't be so judgmental.
While like many other progressives I see Biden as having done very little to win me over on policy, I am becoming increasingly convinced Biden is in this to win it. I am pleasantly surprised with this aspect. #BidenHarris2020
Thank you for your service Mr. Biden your service is invaluable to the trump administration to give them the easiest election in history

Do you think one of those parallels, long experience and relationships in the Senate, gives Biden‚Äôs legislative agenda more legs than Obama‚Äôs had. So much, I guess, depends on the party composition, but that was always a knock on Obama‚Äôs admin, that they struggled on the hill.
I think the author doesn‚Äôt understand that Israel will always be supported by the US, but it‚Äôs obvious Harris and Biden will be less supportive than Trump
President Trump answers dozens of questions daily from a hostile media.   Biden and Harris have answered no questions from a friendly media since announcing the ticket.   Could it be they have no answers to our countries problems?
Simple, if you're voting for Trump, you only vote once.  If you're voting for Biden, vote as many times as you like.
He is racist. My black friends and neighbors definitely are not all the same. They aren't all Biden voters either. Of course Biden doesn't even think they are black if they don't vote for him.

I have to assume this dam will break eventually. It's unsustainable. I'm fine with team Biden playing prevent defense for a while, but he'll have to make the rounds eventually, and this really raises the stakes for when he does. If he doesn't ever, of course, that should cost him
Ooo, sweet burn, bro. Even tho Biden and Harris gave speeches 2 days ago, the day after he announced Harris would be his VP. Not in his basement.
That‚Äôs his point I think. If Democrats start acting like an opposition party for once they‚Äôll  beat him pretty handily. 2 1/2 months should be enough time. Just don‚Äôt let Trump, who‚Äôs willing to run left of Biden on issues to win, actually run left of Biden. I would love to 1/

Not even Biden is pretending like he's going for a second tern and has basically saidbas much, I know he said he "isn't ruling it out" but he pretty much has to say that.  Every indication is that he will serve one term, if that.

I agree in sentiment, but this election is different. Trump is openly dismantling all the socialists progress we‚Äôve made. He‚Äôll see the end to Social Security, Medicare/caid, libraries, USPS, publi utilities and LGBT+ progress. A Biden admin wouldn‚Äôt do this.
We need to vote out Trump this November. Vote Kamala and Biden and we can at least have the possibility of moving the country left. Without them, Trump could do unknown atrocities. People advocating AGAINST Biden/Kamala are doing so from a place of privilege.

Are we not doing Bi for Biden?
Of course there are. Biden supporters need to be getting on the phone, knocking on doors, and just in general showing some enthusiasm for their guy. It‚Äôs pathetic and lazy to see only attempts at shaming. The fact is many voters see that the two party system has all but given 1/

I picked trump would win in 2016, I suspect Biden will in 2020.
I‚Äôve been all for Bernie but I voted for Clinton in 16. I have volunteered my time and money to multiple progressive campaigns. I give a shit about my state and want better for it. So can someone from Biden‚Äôs campaign tell me why I should vote for him?
My vote means shit. If I lived in a swing state maybe I‚Äôd be persuaded that Trump is the lesser of two evils. But Kentucky isn‚Äôt vote by mail yet and Covid exists. What is Biden doing that makes me want to take a risk for him? He sure as hell hasn‚Äôt taken a single risk for me.
The rapist and the transphobe or the rapist and the transphobe?  Back when Booker was in the race I probably would‚Äôve voted for Biden since I was already there. But as a resident of Kentucky where Trump won by literally 30 points what the fuck is the point of me voting this year?
Now do Biden‚Äôs son. Seriously you are a fool.

What did Obama/Biden do about it ?
My sister and I were talking about how disappointing it is that  isn‚Äôt our nominee. We‚Äôre still going to vote for Biden and Harris but our hearts will always be with Elizabeth Warren. I trust she will be a force for good in the Senate after we sweep #MoscowMitch out.
üëáüèª by what mystical power are the disenfranchised meant to ‚Äúhold them accountable?‚Äù When has this ever happened? What possible reason would Biden/Harris have for listening to radical demands AFTER receiving the mandate to rule, if they don‚Äôt even care now?
Preface this by saying I‚Äôm an independent. Trump has major character flaws. Biden clearly has something going on. It‚Äôs gonna be a shit show. Depending on media sway- this virus and/or social unrest may disappear by November.
Right, like Hunter Biden? Nice try!
Tucker is the angry and unhinged face of the Republican party.   Biden and Harris are mature and balanced and are ready to lead America out of the dark days of Donald J Trump.
Political fear mongering is a tactic used when you're losing on the issues.   America, we are losing over 1,000 patriotic Americans a day from the coronavirus under   watch. Keep that in mind when you're voting for Joe Biden 2020. The truth and morals matter.
Biden is going to take your guns, no, wait, your God, no, its even worse!  He‚Äôs going to take your steaks!!!  How can the Onion even compete with this!?
Translation:  Biden wants to save American lives.  Trump doesn't care about anything but his reelection.
Dammit!  You can read me so well.  But in the socialist hellscape I am hoping Biden-Harris implement, I would get rid of the internet and give that money to all the poors, amirite?

Joe Biden demands you wear a mask while eating. üò∑ü§£üòÇ
Damn straight I'm proudly supporting them. ALL IN. Biden wasn't my choice but Harris for VP was. She will help him win like no other. Electing them will enable progressive policy conversations. 3rd party votes will NOT, &amp; will help Trump literally continue to kill like no other

I'm a leftist that will be voting for Biden, because I genuinely believe that we will not survive another 4 years of Trump.
Public policy for Biden/Harris.  Unofficial adviser.  Always persists - and dumping Trump is the most righteous fight yet.
enthusiasm for Biden wasn‚Äôt great from the beginning...Harris polled at 1% before she dropped out. They‚Äôve had the media, Hollywood, sports, big banks etc. on their side the entire time. He could def lose...but truly think they‚Äôll do ANYTHING to keep him from winning

I think Biden is going to win....but I acknowledge this possibility that Trump could still win in a surprise as he did in 2020  It shocks me how many Trump supporters refuse to even acknowledge the possibility he could lose. It is really crazy
Guys, I absolutely can not.   The Biden/Kamala supporters are crawling through the woodworks to assure me that if I don‚Äôt vote for them, I‚Äôm secretly against trans people.   Yes. Me and my trans best friend, who both hate Biden, hate trans individuals. The secrets are out. üßêüëå
Biden and Harris will lock you up for not wearing a mask alone in the woods. Meanwhile the rest of the Democrats won‚Äôt lock people up for anything , except self defense.
Biden has zero power. Biden lives in a basement. Trump will win re-election. You will cry.
Didn‚Äôt think I could hate Hiden Biden as much tell he farted in his own mouth and let this sh;t roll out
Kamala and Joe want our money to fill their own pockets. They will raise taxes and use the money to cut deals with corporations in order to get kickback's. If you want to keep the money you earn, vote Trump/Pence. If you want the government to blow your üí∞, vote Harris/Biden! üá∫üá≤
If religious voters were sitting on the fence before Biden made his VP pick then they were morons. The race and any mandate will be delivered by the excitement and turn out of the base, not the extent to which Harris appeases religious fence sitters. Go for the low hanging fruit.

so do you believe Biden's accusers or not?  Oh that's right, the #MeToo and #believeallwomen movements ended when  got the nomination.
I did the same a while back, I even un followed some people because following them had Biden and others popping up in my timeline constantly. And while we get bored/distracted truly NOTHING else matters but Christ and witnessing to the lost. God's got the rest under control.üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

Welllllll, Biden did say everyone should wear masks for the next 3 months with no explanation and took no questions. So that's kinda leadership.....if you're a fucking idiot.
Biden is a transitional candidate don't expect too much from Him Harris and who she chooses as a Running mate in 4yrs is where the Medicare for all conversation begins shes for it ! .Biden will step down after 2-3yrs more than likely ..
What... Do you you have a hard time understanding that with Harris and Biden we're moving closer to Medicare for all even if it comes from the next president after Biden . But if Trump elected we'll move further RIGHT as a country and won't get Medicare for all PERIOD!
No shit but Biden will do 2-3Yrs and hand it off to Harris, the next president will be able to be more progressive after that . It's a slow progression .but if Trump is elected then no we'll move further from Medicare for all. Does that make sense ?

And before you say "uh vote him out in November," remember that he is trying to make that completely impossible. What are you going to do when he steals the election? Are Biden/Harris gonna give some weak concession speech and ride off to collect speakers' fees?
It is lame. The more they attack Harris the better off Biden and Democrats are. It will not sour non-white voters who already see Trump for the racist pig that he is. Ultimately, attacking Harris will look like misogyny and turn off the white suburbanites Trump covets.
I'm as left as we can get, but I'm pulling for Biden/Harris just like I pulled for Clinton/Kaine.  I like our chances this time around. I'm not trying to win the world-- just trying to get my foot on solid ground.
You mean, Biden gets the one without pictures in it?!

This may be premature, but if Biden gets elected, we need to seriously push our govt to pay the first lady. I'm sure Mr. Kamala Harris is nice, but I know some fool is gonna wanna give him a First Man salary in 2024, and if that happens we will rage! #FLOTUS #PayJill #paygap

Why not just say "if Biden gets elected the world will blow up."? More fear is produced and it's just as big a lie as any of the others he tells.
I don't want to see either of them.  Both are abominations.   But, I feel trump is far worse.  He is worse as a human being, he is worse for the nation, he is worse for democracy.   I don't support Biden because trump is worse.  I don't support Biden period.

If Donald Trump‚Äôs gambit to defund the post office so we can‚Äôt have mail-in voting fails, he will slash the ink budget so there isn‚Äôt enough to put Joe Biden‚Äôs name on the ballot.
I think the Biden campaign wishes the You Ain't Black episode would go away, but this kind of 'support' for the campaign extends that message. I don't understand your reference to a 'messenger' but I do know Mr Arthur. He's not posing or playing a role.
The best gift Biden gave Trump was picking this POS as VP.

I think because our economies have a symbiotic relationship, there will never be s war between China and the US. I do think they need to open the country more to foreign investment. If Biden becomes president, he should stay strong on them, and force them to open their markets.

You are so delusional. You talk about Biden mental state. You need to check yourself!!  No one is more delusional than you. Start packing your bags.  Time is up for you!! #dumptrump2020
Biden and Harris didn‚Äôt steal from a children‚Äôs charity.
I try to understand the frustration of people who don't like Biden/Harris but are voting for them, and I also get the anxiety of the people freaking out that people don't like them and will cause them to lose, we are all in rough shape here.
Somebody knows Biden is in decline. Never thought you'd support socialism Bill. You must be as hollow in your beliefs as Biden and Kamala
Yes, I have, have you? The very idea that the attack ah#gainst Biden is going to be his mental acuity with the orange dipshit in the White House is laughable üôÑ
Not everybody even gets to fuckin vote lmao!! Like!!!!!!!! And we ~HAVE~ to choose Biden....just like we HAD to choose Hillary.....THIS IS OUR FUCKING COUNTRY TF!!!! WE DO NOT HAVE TO DO SHIT!!!!!!
I actually feel enthusiasm about voting for Biden now. Biden, and Harris.
see also: that biden ad with the corvette
If I didn't know who Biden was, and someone told me he was a conservative operative attempting to preserve Jim Crow and told me about his record, I'd think they'd have a case.
If Biden wins, corona=poof. If Trump wins, corona stays.
Let alone Biden can‚Äôt even complete two sentences!
You really want to compare Trump to Biden, 47 year failure!
so I commented on a local news post and comments Biden/Harris 2020. The post was flagged as breaking their harassment and bullying policy. It gave me an option to challenge the decision, which I did. Shortly after I challenged
You mean like Joe Biden?
Because he hates trump and he wants Biden to win.
People bringing up all the dirt on Kamala and Biden like a literal racist who has done worse things isn‚Äôt in office and overtly showed us this before claiming his position.  WHO TF ARE YALL TRYING TO PROTECT, TRUMP?!?
You‚Äôd think that Biden would know how to pronounce his VP‚Äôs actual name...maybe the next news conference....in October.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt pronounce his running mates first name. He‚Äôs such a racist
I don‚Äôt understand how boomers can (with a STRAIGHT FACE) accuse me of getting my opinions on Kamala and Biden from Russian bots on Twitter when all they do when they aren‚Äôt working is scroll on Facebook and watch MSNBC ALL. DAY. LONG.
A yes, famous believer in possibilities, Joseph R "Nothing Will Fundamentally Change" Biden
The DNC couldn't have Stacey complain about having the Ga. Election stolen from her while the DNC was helping Biden/Harris steal this election from Trump.
Biden, Harris lash Trump in introduction of historic VP pick  via
She's a Ferguson activist so her main focus is on the police brutality that started before &amp; will continue after Trump. She didn't really take any shots at anyone. She said she will vote for Biden. Hard to imagine she of all people wouldn't understand what a threat Trump is
You believe Biden's accusers?
I mean have you heard some of the things Biden has said over the years??
That's because Biden can't think for himself and always puts his racist foot in his mouth.
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden
If they really want trump to lose, they should vote libertarian.  They KNOW we won't vote for Biden, so their best chance is to vote for  and  .  #ImWithHer because #ShesWithUs
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden
Who would be stupid enough to vote for Biden
Incredible difference listening to Biden and Harris speak, I have absolutely no respect for this current administration!
The guy is literally working with the Trump campaign to siphon votes away from Biden.  I mean that's seriously what his goal is.  Like meeting with Kushner and everything.
congrats on the nomination Mrs. Harris.  I am asking the same question I asked 4 years ago.  I am looking for a person to vote for that I can respect.  You seem to not respect Biden, from comments in this past year.  Why should I vote for the Biden/Harris ticket?
Biden introduces VP choice Harris; much history, no crowd &gt;&gt;
Obama tried to destroy the USA and Biden was too dumb to say anything.  Biden a career politician who hasn‚Äôt accomplished a thing.
Trump is not senile, biden is
My 5 year old would beat Biden in a debate ... all he would have to know is what town he is in ...  Biden thought his sister was his wife earlier in the year lol
Kamala:   ‚ÄúHe inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden... and then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground‚Äù  Me:
Trump VS Biden ...round 1.
Can I resist the double trigger troll factor?  I really don't think I can...
Howsabout Lady MacBeth Biden?
I'll stand when Joe Biden is sworn in .
Made me cry to hear her speak so eloquently of what a devoted father Joe Biden is. She is intelligent, caring and educated. Something sadly lacking in the current President and Vice President.
Don‚Äôt forget how she believed Biden‚Äôs accusers too! Believe all women? I guess not anymore when power is on the line!
But she‚Äôs on the VP Ticket, new game, Bozo, start packing#Biden/Harris 2020!!!!
I need to know who Joe Biden‚Äôs tailor is.
A new mayor isnt going to solve hundreds of years of racial oppression and the issues in the criminal justice system.Even the voters don't believe that or else they would vote these people out!Trump trying to simply stop the looting or protesting won't solve anything. Biden 2020
The Pope loves Joe Biden and that's good enough for this Catholic.
I agree with him Trump is just pooring gasoline on the fire reforms need to be made, or the cancer will spread .Trumo wants to silence the movement and crush it and hand it off to the next guy, but more riots and more fire will come . BIDEN/Harris 2020
Oh geez you‚Äôre so right I better not vote for Biden hmmm let‚Äôs look at the rest of the ballot
It is hard to watch Trump speak, after watching the fast articulating, motivating, positive speech of Biden and Harris!
You‚Äôve been rallying behind Biden since the beginning. They really think they can outsmart us with mind games, and it makes me want to really show them how little their vote means without young Black voters behind them.
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù -Joe Biden. What are you expecting to happen in his administration? Working class will continue to suffer, war will continue to rage. Some people will just feel better, but the state of the nation will not ‚Äúfundamentally change‚Äù
Does she still believe Biden‚Äôs accuser of sexual assault?! Not now I guess.
Here comes the blame game ALREADY, so they have someone to yell at when Biden loses (as if he wasn‚Äôt going to anyways).
We have bigger issues Biden/Harris2020
I just watched Biden/Harris and it was so refreshing to hear two people who can speak so well while expressing their thoughts. It took me back to Pres. Clinton and Pres. Obama. Instead of numb nuts...
5. Neither were my absolute top pick for President or Vice President. Today‚Äôs speech did help me get excited for the ticket though. The Biden/Harris ticket seems to have more energy and charisma than the Clinton/Kaine ticket.
While Biden and Harris did let Trump have it, they also gave ideas on what a Biden Presidency night look like and I was on board with having a Biden Presidency listen to the scientists about Covid.
As evidenced during the VP debate in 2016.   3. Both speeches from Biden and Harris were empathetic, detailed, and tough on Trump when needed.   4. Clinton was criticized for focusing her campaign on solely being the anti Trump candidate.
I need that....To hear someone speak that is really capable of leadership. We are hungry for that. No lies and pulling a rabbit out of his ass like somebody else I know. Preach Biden  and K Harris. We can not deny the fact that that news briefing was right on point
A few things from Biden and Harris‚Äôs speech today.   1. They have great chemistry together. That was something I didn‚Äôt think that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has exactly.   2. Harris will be an attack dog VP candidate. Kaine struggled with this role
The gaslighting and ignorant ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù my parents are trying to provide on why Biden/Harris is better literally makes me want to vote for Trump JUST so they lose and I can throw it in their faces. (I won‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs how mentally unbalanced I‚Äôm feeling.
2/7 To some, Harris is problematic because her police record doesn't conform to burlesque standards of an acceptable constabulary, and Biden's Senate record categorizes him as a "racist" since he once dared to question the wisdom and utility of busing children.
1/7 The Democrats have quite the wrinkled shirt on their hands. According to Biden, Harris isn't Black (and according to the standards of the left, she is and is not at the same time). According to Harris, Biden is an abuser of women (and an enfeebled man).
Biden/Harris event wraps up with Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" and, politics aside, that's a hot jam for a campaign song.
Did you see those spouses greeting Biden and Harris? We've not ONCE witnessed Melania greet trump with such love and respect. Ever. #BidenHarris2020
It will have to be an unmistakable and slide for Biden to win. Look at the Belarus election. The Russians have a stake in keeping NATO out of Belarus. Lukashenko did NOT get 80% of the vote! #RussianInterference Same thing will play out here in November...
Holy shit, after listen to Biden and Harris  has   Hello Anderson Cooper
I‚Äôve never heard as many lies, sexism and racism on Fox News as I did during the Biden/Harris press conference
Let me help your out Eddie while you are making a fool of yourself
Don can't take this. If Biden does one of these a week, the Cheeto pimple will pop.
If you think Biden is in a mental decline then it‚Äôs obvious that Trump is in full blown dementia at this point.
Biden on racism: "My father used to say, 'Silence is complicity.' Not original to him, but he believed it."  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How wonderful listening to Vice President Biden and Senator Harris. These two are inspiring. Caring thoughtful, intelligent people. What a difference from the trash in the White House now. #BidenHarris2020 #nastywoman
JoeBiden: Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don‚Äôt have anyone on their side with this president.   That‚Äôs going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
Harris just said it‚Äôs a honor to be with Biden. Just during the primary she called him a racist.  ü§°ü§°
It‚Äôs so refreshing to hear some one that‚Äôs actually Presidential. In the 5 minutes I listed Biden has restored my hope that we will survive this pandemic and racial turmoil as a country.
Shame on . for not showing the Biden/Harris event live. All the other major stations are. Minor league guys. Minor league.
That was as good a Biden we‚Äôve seen so far.
Joe Biden sounds like a President.
Hi Lily and pals!! You watching Biden and Harris?
And... Trump has always been completely respectful of Biden???
‚ÄúHispanics, unlike blacks, are a very diverse people.‚Äù - Joe Biden 2020
‚ÄúNothing will fundamentally change‚Äù -Joe Biden
doesn‚Äôt it all depend on what Biden said? the portion of the clip she claims he said wasn‚Äôt shown.
You all watching Biden and Harris?
I am over the whole group. I am going to try my best over the next 3 months to not waste one more minute giving them my attention.  Henceforth my energy and time will be used to get Biden et al into the WH.
Basement Biden and Caretaker Kamala
Here we go!!!!  Biden/Harris 2020!!
what do you believe will get worse? like even the covid response, I would have so much more faith in a biden administration dealing with it than a trump administration. trumps literally tryna force kids to go to school rn like thats fucked
LIVE: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make 2020 debut
Okay I‚Äôm here for this Biden/Harris presser but the music is wearing me out
Uh huh. Every single republican I‚Äôve met has said they don‚Äôt like his rhetoric but hate the dems and will vote him anyway. They‚Äôve been conditioned that dems (even Biden) are trying to turn the country into the Soviet Union. I‚Äôm not sure why there‚Äôs a modern red scare??
that's interesting. trump defunding Obamacare has resulted in over 20 million people losing healthcare and 5 more million since corona. trump doesn't even have a health care plan while biden is proposing a public option so everybody would get insurance. thats not better?
Wait, so Democrat politicians and MSM can attend school but students can't? Biden Harris first appearance taking place at Dupont high school.
biden at least has a plan to decriminalize drugs which would make mass incarceration a much smaller issue. trump pardoned a couple black people and now he thinks he's done more for black people than any other person ever üòÇ
Exacly! Joe Biden/Harris is strong ticket. They actually gave the experience to run the country .
Given all the vitriol I see aimed at the Biden-Harris ticket, all I can say is, America is fucking doomed.
No Vote for Biden .
Election are coming, don't think you can lose your cushy job Mitchy? Ask Matt Bevin Biden/Harris 2020
How about ‚ÄúBiden makes historic move to resurrect Maya Rudolph‚Äôs career.‚Äù
WATCH LIVE: Biden And Harris Give First Joint Remarks As Running¬†Mates
Initial response to Harris' selection from the right has been to drag out all of her more extreme policy takes over the years. That's fair game, but I suspect they overestimate how effective they will be when she starts cleaning them up and sounding more in tune with Biden.
One of Harris' biggest problems in the primary was she didn't know what policies to support (see MFA debacle). She's not an ideologue, she wants to position herself to the electorate. Being a VP candidate will suit her. Aligning to Biden will make her stronger as a candidate.
Your point is what, that Biden picked the right person? I agree! #BidenHarris2020
But if that man wins again, there won't be anything. This country is at a tipping point. The disenfranchised have already been feeling it. I had no intention of voting for Biden, that Tangerine Farquuad showed me I have no choice when he gassed protestors for a photo op.
I honestly think so, Biden was leading in every poll without her, she'll only boast the lead for JOE and it shows that we're moving in the right direction, the ticket seems like change . I wasn't going to vote for Biden but I will now .
I will never fully support the Biden/Harris ticket, but my vote is going toward them. The stakes are too high.
I'm voting for the Biden/Harris ticket as well .
Oh I'm voting trump. Im not voting for the mentally incompetent joe Biden.
Well if Biden and Harris win then a Bernie like person and or policies will be at the top in 3-4yrs
Let the games begin! Biden/Harris 2020!
Goes straight to Joe
Basement Biden and Caregiver Kamala
Basement Biden and Caregiver Kamala
In your dreams, but Biden and Harris are looking back at you in your nightmares.   Better wear those depends so you don't pee on yourself in bed
If that is who you want for President  because we all know Joe Biden can't do it then know people who can laugh about jailing parents like this mom they can do anything. She isn't better than Trump. She will be harder to fight with all those libs sleeping like the fools they are
Translation:  I think I can take attention off Biden/Harris because I'm a little baby
But you never gonna find a perfect candidate.  I wasn't for Biden or Harris. But I sure as hell am not voting for the incumbent. And not voting basically is a vote for him.   Let me know when you agree with any politician on every policy and every decision.
Biden don't know and Harris Blows!
If this presidential election proves anything It‚Äôs that everyone needs to stop voting democratic and republican bc both parties are shit and fuck all that this is better than 4 more years of trump, like great 4 years of Biden and Kamala.ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Here's the thing: If the Harris pick pushes you to vote for Trump, you were always going to vote for Trump. That the Dem VP nominee would be someone with views like Harris is not new information. I don't see how a Biden-Harris ticket is somehow worse than a Clinton-Kaine ticket.
Biden deserves the free air time.  Trump is using taxpayer money in ‚Äúbriefings‚Äù to attack Biden anyway, why not take the stage and just say what your plans are, and ignore the drunk at the end of the bar.
Kamala Harris be like   "Vote for biden you niggers"
Why would Biden pick a progressive?
Uh huh you skipped all the people that Biden and Harris have put in prison with their policies, which is a hell of a lot more than 160,000.
They couldn't have Grimmace Bitch and Moan on how the Georgia election was stolen from her while Biden and Harris are trying to steal this election.  Hypocrisy only goes so far.
we could always overthrow the government like we been saying üôÑ but y‚Äôall too cap for that convo... so vote Biden you pussy niggas.
When the rest of the world realizes we're just printing money and stops using us as the base currency, the resulting fall will make the Great Depression look like a day at Disney. Trump doesn't care about this. Biden won't care about it. But you should.
I don‚Äôt get all into politics like that and no candidate will ever have every thing on your checklist but y‚Äôall really keep talking negatively about Biden and his mate, which will give Trump the votes. Y‚Äôall know y‚Äôall don‚Äôt want that man in office another 4 years.
The "I think we should shoot protestors" far right thinks crime bill Biden and copmala are far left as we march off the right side of the cliff.
I‚Äôm hoping Biden will nominate you to be his US Secretary of SHADE because üëë #BidenHarris2020
Wow... When did Tucker join the Biden-Harris campaign? I don't think he's going to convince very many of his listeners, though. ü§£
Yes, because we're moving further towards a progressive candidate. The next vice president or president will be a progressive Sanders type but if Trump gets 4 more years his son will run lol and we'll move further right .so..The Sanders supporters like myself will vote for Biden
No,Biden and Harris will make America Better!!!
So Joe Biden‚Äôs entire policy is just a UNO reverse card. I‚Äôm good with that.
When the alternative is strengthening Trump's power, the choice is obvious. The bar is set very low, and Biden has sailed over it. The Democrats are our only hope to beat Trump. I can't handle 4 more years.
I would fire your campaign manager if he thinks it‚Äôs smart for  to run on Joe Biden being a racist üòÇüòÇ Go back to killing black people and calling them names under your ‚ÄúLaw &amp; Order‚Äù This nurse and #suburbanhousewife is voting Biden/Harris!!
Biden unfortunately
Suburban housewives will be voting for Biden/Harris!  You are dilusionsl!
‚ÄúFox News‚Äô Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris‚Äù FOX News
This is exactly why I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
Oh no!!! Say it isn‚Äôt so!
None are credible or they‚Äôd be in court. No matter how many times you repeat ‚Äúracist‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt come true. On the other hand, Kamala herself believes the allegations against Biden and called HIM racist ü§°
Idgaf Kamala Harris and Biden can disappear. Id be damned if I vote for some mf just cause you foundationless niggas tell me soüòÇ y‚Äôall be voting out of fear‚Äî that‚Äôs some sorry ass shit.
Agreed but I also think that‚Äôs why Biden got the Dem money.
Suburban. ‚úÖ Wife. ‚úÖ Lives in house. ‚úÖ VOTING FOR BIDEN. ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
You continue to spew centrist talking points ignoring all context.  Bernie's wealth is a very recent thing and it hasn't shaped his policy. If anything he was further left leaning following his first presidential run.  Biden crafts Jim Crow policy.
He also donated to Joe Biden
So you saying Obama/Biden didn't cause thousands of deaths? Or do only American lives matter?
According to the right, Joe Biden wants to defund the police which is exactly why he picked Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and "top cop," for his VP pick.   Joe Biden is playing 15-dimensional chess to dismantle the police from the inside. The man is a mastermind
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump because regardless nothing will change
Biden &amp; Kamala - one sucks, and the other blows.
I hate the guilt trip game. It‚Äôs a false ass statement by people who are uncertain their candidate will win.  Not voting is not voting.   Voting 3rd party is voting 3rd party.   Voting for Biden is voting for Biden   Voting for Trump is voting for Trump.  End of discussion.
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick.
For some people, getting back to "normal" is the priority. They are 100% fine with Biden/Harris enacting Trump/Pence policies, but dressed up in 2020 DNC rhetoric. The quiet parts will be quiet again. The text will return to subtext. All will be well.
Historic Photo: Biden asks Harris to be his VP
As someone that lived through it, Biden was right to oppose forced busing. MAGA
Y‚Äôall save your anti-Biden shit for AFTER the election. Otherwise? You‚Äôre doing Tr*mp a favor. This includes retweets too luv
Think of how depressing it is to be a biden campaign staffer having to call some bullshit like family first, usa united super PAC and ask for 300k that goes to  for like a tweet a week and two rally appearances
Plus... I don't remember Biden announcing that he would be hiring someone based on their race and sex. I DO remember him saying that African American women were among the people he was considering.
This white woman ain‚Äôt voting for him! Biden/Harris has been the ticket I‚Äôve wanted since she opted out. She‚Äôs the bulldog he needed and I cannot WAIT to see her tear Pence a new one in the Veep debate.
"Biden will help deliver a massive climate deal that will generate real jobs. Trump repealed or rearranged every environmental act he could find."
Trump says 'suburban housewife' will vote for him over Biden, cites low-income housing policies  #FoxNews
Why is Trump emailing you? Biden campaign emails me because I donate to his campaign weekly
Mitch McConnell campaign press release says Amy McGrath supports the "radical" Biden-Harris ticket, adding "If elected, these Three Political Stooges would lurch our nation to the left and usher in a new era of socialism in the U.S."
Everyone is talking about how Biden needs to win for the Supreme Court but he‚Äôs probably going to end up nominating a conservative justice to promote unity and then you guys will keep moving the goal posts to gaslight progressives ü•¥
I really got beef wit everybody that voted for Biden in the primaries y‚Äôall and y‚Äôall candidate can eat a dick
I used the word 'season'. I think most would use 'era'. I think season is the correct word, as my suspicion is that to end the era, stop it from becoming a major turning point, the oligarchy intentionally choose Harris and Biden.
It amazes me how often Republicans can over look the lunacy that trump says and does. I can over look the stumbling speeches. The cognitive decline. The physical decline. But joe biden cant form a thought. You keep telling yourself that lie
can't wait for Biden to further explain the tremendous diversity in that community.
Yeah, lol, I know what you meant.  Can't change the past, wish I could.  All I can say is, Biden has pledged to reverse all of those policies begin reuniting families, and end detention in the first 100 days. It's on his website.  I mean, that's what we all want, right?
The entire thing is just very hypocritical and tone deaf, and with Biden‚Äôs track record with unintentionally insulting the Black community, it makes me wonder if this was a blatantly calculated tactic to have her as VP.
This is what he REALLY wanted to type: White Women will be voting for me. They want safety and lord knows they don‚Äôt want Black people or People of Color in their community. A vote for Biden means BLACKS!!! Be afraid be very afraid!
And that‚Äôs great but his campaign desperately needs enthusiasm. For those that really think electing Biden will make a significant difference in this country I can‚Äôt figure out 4 the life of me why they arent donating endless time and money like the unprecedented Bernie campaign.
Biden said he would serve only one term. I interpret his choice as setting her up for the big job. Always possible I am being wildly optimistic, but I am picking that hill to die on.
Just a reminder, final Hillary/Trump odds were ~68/32.  Roughly speaking, if this "game" was played three times, Biden wins twice and Trump once -- just like four years ago.  But now Trump is in a lot more control of how "lucky" he can get on Election night.
Nope. They'll be voting for Biden &amp; Harris. You've already defunded Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; want to gut them. They're general welfare items under the Constitution (Art I ¬ß8 Cl1).
I am 1000% sure Joe Biden has said, ‚Äúand trust me, I have A LOT of half black friends‚Äù at least twice in the last 5 years
Adorable puppies.  Biden/Harris2020!!!
y‚Äôall think biden can beat trump? lol ok
So they differ in their devotion to the corporate hegemony, if only slightly. Biden befriended segregationists &amp; wrote policy that cruelly punished people for living in poverty. Predictably, it was used to target victims of institutional racism. Modern day Jim Crow.
I hope you‚Äôre not just shaming. That‚Äôs the incredibly lazy and child like way to go about things. The adult thing to do is what the Bernie crowd did for their candidate. If you want Biden/Harris to win you better be making phone calls, knocking on doors, and donating money.
Newt Gingrich: Biden vs. suburbs ‚Äî here's how Dem plan would declare war on American dream  #FoxNews , democrats need to stop hating Trump and look what‚Äôs at stake .
You will make any excuse.  He just told you that Kamala believes Biden finger-raped one of his workers, and you‚Äôre ok with it. Astounding.
People arguing against this are in the same category as anti-maskers, imo. Self-centered outlook, justified by  a sense of moral/intellectual superiority.  Vote for Biden as if some border kid locked in a cage's life depends on it, because those are the stakes right now.
I know I said I'd support Biden regardless of his VP pick simply because he isn't Trump.....but y'all are testing me. A cop. He picked a cop. A cop with a questionable history of fairly applying the law to black people. READ THE ROOM JOE
Okay I guess we can wait a week and then discuss all the black people she helped lock and use as slave labor for California. Which was made possible thanks to Biden's policies. Party on.
voters?! Oh well, maybe now I‚Äôll at least see a bumper sticker or two on the roads. Because you know, Biden ‚Äòwon‚Äô the primary. 2/
Lots of people seem enthusiastic about the Biden/Harris ticket. That‚Äôs a start I guess. I wonder how many phone calls they‚Äôre willing to make and how much money those supporters plan on donating. Or are they only going to participate in democracy via the lazy way by shaming 1/
Facebook people talking bout they rather have 4 more years of trump, than Biden/Harris. And before you ask, no they aren‚Äôt
üî∏Any quibble I have on any aspect of Kamala Harris is completely overshadowed by the threat that another Trump term represents, especially to our most vulnerable citizens.  üî∏There are zero reasons to not vote for Biden as an alternative to Trump.
üî∏White women conservative voters who are generally disgusted by Trump have also watched a lot of Fox News propaganda about "riots" in Portland, etc. and it is not unsavvy of Biden to pick a VP candidate that might allay these voters fears.
Well I just wouldn‚Äôt vote then. Bc Biden shouldn‚Äôt be our president lol
I know everyone hates Trump, for very good reasons, but y‚Äôall should really do your research on Biden/Harris before voting. Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger.. just trying to put people up on game. OUTSIDE of social media hype &amp; the news..
Gag! ‚ÄúSuburban housewife‚Äù here- you do not speak for me! I will vote for Biden/Harris to represent my voice
People from the right shit talking Kamala as a VP pick we‚Äôre already not voting for Biden. She wasn‚Äôt picked for you, so don‚Äôt act like your personal opinion is an indication of the 2020 outcome.
Your stance can only work for Biden-Harris because they are running against an open fascist. In your case, the ONLY way you can contest a sitting Senator is via POLICY. WHERE. DO. YOU. STAND??
That ‚Äúhalf assed attempt‚Äù was mocked and labeled unecessary by Pelosi and countless other Dems and even xenophobic by Biden. Now it wasn‚Äôt enough? And bringing up New York‚Äôs handling of things is laughable. The governor should be criminally charged for his nursing home policy!
Leftists ARE the alienated voters. All of Biden's pablum is catnip to the rest of the voters who just want the same-old-same-old stuff and are hostile to any and all progressive policy proposals.
Watch Joe Biden give an endless hug to Hillary Clinton  via
üò≠üò≠üò≠ and Biden‚Äôs VP choice ain‚Äôt shit. Like what the fuck
Doesnt harris enjoy throwing the book at people for weed? And biden was partially behind overcharging black people, leading to mass incarceration with the "tough on crime" law? How is this a positive thing?
Fuck Joe Biden and Donald Trump as well. Yall can lie to yall selves and act like they not one in the same but choosing between the lesser of two evils is still choosing EVIL. Fuck that
If Biden wins, #Kamala will become President. She'd then be the first US president to have BOTH non-citizen parents at the time of her birth in the US (Obama had 1), a citizenship status that Scalia in Hamdi called "presumed."
I don't want to spend much time dunking on Biden or Harris before they replace #FascistTrump (that treatment mostly waits for these CorpoDems to be installed), But I wonder how long until the identity euphoria ends and voters start thinking about actual Biden-Harris policies.
Trump has serious and decades old connections with oligarchs in Russia laundering money. He is a compromised individual because he has laundered money for the Russians plus more. Biden is not compromised. Putin owns Trump. That‚Äôs the difference. Trump is a compromised asset.
I like Joe Biden‚Äôs plan where he is not going to allow any rich people in your middle class neighborhood.
I‚Äôm Catholic and I‚Äôm all Biden. So you go ahead and be a two face and vote for the orange evil. You pretty much make me sick.
a Biden/Harris administsrtarion allows for agency, organization, and bargaining power. The executive branch is only one piece of the puzzle. Vote progressives into congress and state gov.
Bernie had the momentum to flip seats. Bernie's policy generates excitement. Biden's campaign is begging and shaming people to show up simply because he isn't Trump. That's how we lose midterms.  Bernie wasn't corrupt enough for the corporate masters of the Democratic party.
This dude is gonna sweep. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DNC, once again, give us no good alternative. First Killary, now dementia Biden and flip flopped Harris.
She‚Äôs more racist than Biden then according to the left now !!!
Joe Biden Chooses Kamala Harris as Running Mate on 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate #TheBriefing
And Biden can‚Äôt do a press conference or a interview with any one you all forget what she said about Biden !
Biden himself has an abysmal record on criminal justice reform, what else would you expect?! #ImWithHer #JoCo2020You realize Obama and Biden were spying on Americans with the very same Patriot Act apparatus that they promised during their campaign to end, right? They were even caught using it in 2013, they used it AGAIN in 2016 on Trump. That is 'the stunt'. Wake up.
Muslim scholar slams media, Biden for reaction to Trump's 'epic and historic' Israel-UAE peace deal
Tensions linger between Biden and Obama camps throughout 2020 primary campaign: report

Joe Biden went from praising Confederate organizations who supported the KKK to becoming the Dem pres candidate.   Come to think of it that's not a stretch.   Hillary got the Margaret Sanger award. She started planned parenthood to get rid of black people.
Joe Biden was the author of a 1994 crime bill that turned into a key reason for the 90's incarceration bump. He has shown a complete lack of touch in public relations, intentionally and accidentally insulting workers and anyone who questions him.
The Democratic Party's selection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as proposed leaders of the U.S. shows a direct lack of touch/care in relation to multiple months of protests - main topics being police brutality and systemic racism.

I‚Äôll clean up my act, apologizing for sleeping to get ahead thoughts and make it about policy/ political history. In the debates she was that little girl and now Biden‚Äôs the guy to bring us together. Really? Her record as AG was  horable, which was brought out in the debates.

Haha CNN tell you that? After 2 years of hearing non-stop media coverage about Russian collusion with ZERO proof you would think people would realize they got played. I guess not though. How about Biden‚Äôs actual connections to Ukraine and China though?
I just had a girl block me on Facebook bc I said that Biden was the lesser of two evils. She said that Biden is a child molester and I can‚Äôt understand bc I don‚Äôt have children. I literally can‚Äôt. Do people not realize that painting people out to prey on children is propaganda?
But my greatest area of common ground was the left's renewed emphasis on reforming the criminal justice system. I would've had more confidence in Biden's commitment to this had he picked just about anyone else.
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend there was a chance of me voting blue in November. But I definitely looked at a Biden ticket as I did Trump in 2016 and now: someone I'm not voting for but can at least expect to accomplish things in areas of common ground.
Who knows, maybe she does believe those things, but if she truly believed Biden had segregationist views would she agree to be his VP? Prob not, but she had no problem insinuating it anyways.   Okay so she's smeared a couple people as racists, thats it thought right?
Some of the "Vote Biden/Harris and hold them accountable in the WH" folks are the same ones that snidely scold anyone who supports leftist challengers to Republicans or  corporatist Democrats.   Their vision of accountability is feckless.
He will never debate her. Just like trump won‚Äôt debate Biden. Trumps already said he doesn‚Äôt need to debate.

Also, I'm going to predict Biden picks Whitmer as VP. I might be wrong, but I think Grandpa wants that Health Insurance lobby money.
#Democrats have done nothing for minorities.  Joe Biden has definitely let it be known that they take the black vote for granted.
Biden has a documented life long stutter. If you seriously confuse a disability with dementia you probably shouldn't be voting at all. The other guy makes up words, can't annunciate anything, leans forward when he stands and walks and can't stand upright without swaying...hmm.
You do realize Biden never said he would pick a black woman for VP. He said he would pick a woman for VP and would pick a POC for supreme court and would CONSIDER  a woman of color for VP. I still say he will pick Hillary because he never said he would pick a woman of color.
