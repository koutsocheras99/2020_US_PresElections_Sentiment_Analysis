what fucking happens when trump won't leave office?
your ego doesn't mean fucking shit now, it's crunch time.  3 months and Trump's so far underwater that James Cameron wants to send a submarine to find him  what happens when he won't leave?
so when trump refuses to leave "because china" then what?
By that logic she is still incorrect. This would mean that the ACA does not cover pre-existing conditions for all heart insurance plans. Maybe not all citizens have plans that fall under protection of the ACA, Trump’s executive order would cover this under ALL health insurance
I don't think Team Trump understands how the world really works.  If you break it, you own it.

His co star  for sure is a liberal and decided he is going to vote for Trump. I actually learned from him.  I used to think Trump was a crappy person and president when I followed cable news. Turns out he's only a crappy person and a pretty decent president.
Come on Dads.....it's the limited Trump edition!  Get them while you can, because they will only be on sale till November 3rd and never sold again. Perfect gift idea for GOP Dad looking to show their daughter's how much they respect and value them. Grab P---Y here.

Trump's Rant About How Joe Biden Will Kill God Was Insane But Clarifying  via
😂😂😂😂😂😂nope Trump isn't raising my kids so they won't be pathological liars since we respect the truth. You clearly haven't read Mueller's report or really much of anything I'd you think Trump is 😂clean. I can't even type that without laughing. Good luck w your fantasy land
The Trump campaign goes into overdrive, trying to hide it from the public.  For a while, they're successful, but eventually, the truth comes out.  They then try to pass it off as a hoax, but with every passing day that Trump isn't seen in public, suspicions continue to grow...
Oh you are so funny! Except red states are the biggest welfare queens, &amp; right now, over 30 million are without jobs cuz Trump can't manage a pandemic. And it may just blow your little mind that this liberal used to work in law enforcement, but you keep believing in stereotypes🙃
Dude, they fucking believe in a magical sky being. You think they can't pretzel their minds around a fucking deviant being their golden calf/savior. They're fucking frightened children and Trump is their fucking binky.
😂😂😂😂😂😂Research!!! Trump has been a bigot his entire life! Kicked blacks out of his apts. and was sued for it.  “Fine people on both sides.” He can’t even take a stand for right  or wrong against white supremacy. He is all about himself, his re-election, and his lies.
And yet even weak Obama imposed sanctions that pissed off Russia so much they colluded with Flynn in December before Trump took office and Flynn promised the sanctions would go away
Can we just get a class action lawsuit going against Trump and his Post Master General?  Everyone depends on the post office; many for medications they need to live.  Trump is endangering millions of lives in addition to his indifference toward the Coronavirus.
Also, dumbass, "cancel culture" is capitalism 101.  Every American citizen has the right to spend their money as they see fit and if thst means boycotting a company for a practice or stance, that's their right.  Trump does "cancel culture" well.

I was gonna vote for Biden because it is critical Trump loses. But I live in Oregon, a deeply blue state which because of the electoral college will inevitably go blue. So I actually plan to vote Bernie Sanders anyway, even as a write in.
Cuz this is the only The Hill article on nursing homes I came across
Yes that's what I said, trump told states, get your own supplies rather than the feds ordering large amounts for cheaper, thus making states bid against each other for the same supplies &amp; driving prices up. And hello, medical personnel still report ppe shortages

Not for everyone. And if you want it covered you have to change your plan to have less benefits or raise the cost. Trump isn’t very articulate, and definitely should have mentioned he’s fixing the flawed parts of the ACA
We CAN'T let you finish wat you and Obama started. You 2 are why we voted TRUMP as OUR POTUS. Hit the road jack.
The Afordable Care Act is shit. Too expensive and life saving prescription drugs expensive as well. Fortunately Trump overturned the penalty pay for not having health insurance, because some people can’t afford it. And fortunately he signed executive orders to make drugs cheaper
No masks required as 250,000 expected at 10-day Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Here's what to know. Trump voters

Am I missing something?? Obama care already covers pre-existing conditions. Is trump signing a fake executive order? He does know that it’s already covered, right?
It’s willful blindness on their part, just as it has been for the last almost four years of Trump’s presidency!  Pure willful blindness combined with an ignorant sense of self preservation that is going to backfire on them just as it did in the 2018 midterms.
No, "better than trump" is the lowest fucking bar imaginable. Certainly we should hold out prospective president to a higher standard than that?
Mmmm like Trump's Dad.
Trump’s tendencies maybe warrant the comparison like comparing a boxing match to full scale war—they’re both violent fights, but that’s about it.  Implying generally that China and the U.S. at large are similar in degree or kind is gaslighting IMO.
Trump was the drummer in Elliott Smith's first band.   Trump in old Portland should be a meme credited to Lizzy Acker.

Trump is a looter.
I don't know which is more concerning:  Either Trump doesn't understand he's signing an EO that requires insurance companies to do what they are already doing, or that #Trumpsters will believe the BS he's peddling.
Can’t tell if you’re talking about Biden or Trump. Not that it matters.

Our suffering for Trump’s failures is just beginning. We’ve sacrificed 1/2 year, $3 trillion &amp;157,000 lives,&amp; it’s been squandered by 1 man’s incompetence. Not just incomp, but in misguided pursuit of his personal interests over needs of nation he leads.
Just curious, was he a multimillionaire BEFORE Trump made Secretary of the Treasury?
When I say Trump speaks more coherently than Biden, I'm not saying Trump is a good speaker. Far from it. Biden is just THAT bad
The only way one could equate Wheeler and Trump is if they're so removed from reality that they can't tell the difference between anything anymore. Can't tell if it's sad or scary.
And that's why WP voted for trump
That was about the investigation into her emails for using her own server.   Everyone in the Trump Admin is using unsecured communication to avoid leaving a record of their crimes. One fucker built a private phone booth in his office to avoid having a record of his kickbacks.
It’s quite clear what Trump is doing. He signs an EO that does the same thing as the ACA so he can claim it is his EO that provides those benefits.

Also   a) They didn't spy on Trump  b) The Trump campaign was working with Russia during the election so theJustice Department investigating that is proper. Read the Muller Report.
They are like jealous cousins, both using the same pathetic bag of tricks. Trump wishes he was not a rotting bag of fat and neurodegeneration. #WarCrimesWheeler wishes he had an unlimited arsenal and a legislature that would let him get away with anything.
You obviously don't understand the word corrupt.   So many of Trump's appointees have been dismissed for their criminal activity.   And so many rank and file workers have quit because of the crime going on around them, like Barr tanking cases.
I bet Trump's people are brainstorming how they can tie COVID-19 relief to having to prove you voted Republican in November.

I always judge people based on what they would lie about. William Barr leaning on the FBI to get the result he wanted is exactly something that crook would do.   He has squashed every investigation related to Trump and his donors.
Just FYI, love you guys, but the marketing that comes up before your video is Donald Trump....  hard to like your video with that preamble....
I wonder if they're pissed off that you decided to start arresting press first off tonight?  Chilling the first amendment protections of the press is the action of dictators. Who's giving these orders? Chief Lovell? Ted Wheeler? or are you listening to Donald Trump?
We are sending our Trump fans to Canada. We figure a bus ticket is all it will take. No way they will be able to figure out how to get home.
You're not being paranoid at all in my opinion. Trump  is an agent of the Russian government. Even if not in fact he is one in deed. Vladimir Putin is the only world leader he has never challenged in any way ,let alone tried to demean and degrade verbally.

Trump couldn't even model wearing a mask and protect his own supporters. Herman Cain died cuz he went to a trump covid rally and you have the nerve to say trump and the GOP care about the sanctity of life🙄
This comment shows trump's promise of executive orders on COVID relief are a stunt. He knows they're illegal, but he wants to be sued so he can say he's trying to fix the problem &amp; ebil Democrats are suing him. Families will go broke while he plays games &amp; refuses negotiate.
I want #MedicareForAll. It appears that Trump is on the same page as Obama.. and that's ok if you want to continue the ACA.. but it has it's drawbacks, namely MASsIVE DEBT in AMERICA, and STILL unable to insure EVERY HUMAN. We need #MedicareForAll. Now. #CoronaVirus.
Imagine the gay dirt Trump et al have on Lindsey Graham. What else would explain his boot-licking?

If Chuck Schumer wants our kids to die for the economy then how does Joe Biden feel about it?  We know Trump agrees with Schumer.  #CapitalismKills
Nice deflection. Yes we should hold Russia accountable by imposing sanctions, or doing really ANYTHING! Yet Trump is incapable of doing anything but kissing Putin's ass.
Dream on....  He couldn't come up with a comprehensive healthcare plan that would be way affordable and the best plan ever (Trump's words)...you're gonna love it!  He copies a provision in Obamacare.  That is not a healthcare initiative.
I would be overly satisfied with #MedicareForAll. Trump or Joe Biden don't seem to understand the moral values associated with #MedicareForAll. Where is the compassion for the citizens? MILLIONS in #MedicalDebt. 500k per year file BANKRUPTCY over #MedicalDebt, 40k DIE. It's SAD!
Believe it when the ink dries. Trump tried this with UBI a couple months ago.  Man if he does though that would be a swing.

He did... PPB is out of control, the feds are still here and now Trump is saying he may deploy National Guard troops -  has unleashed hell on Portland.
#ObamaCare #ACA  Hello #America,  if we had #MedicareForAll there would be no need for Trump to issue silly executive orders cos  EVERY SINGLE HUMAN IN AMERICA would be AUTOMATICALLY INSURED. No worries.   WILL FIGHT YOU FOR #MedicareForAll   #MedicareForAll or #GetFired2020!

interesting to see different reactions to this, but I'm terrified:  The people who care this is blatantly false aren't going to vote for Trump anyways. The people who don't will see this as Trump not only supporting an intensely popular prohibition *but actually creating it*

WHERE are his covfefe explanations? I need to hear a linguistic history of why Trump was right to use that term.

Who is precious? The public evidence against Trump is overwhelming, so good luck with these predictions of yours
What you are doing here is making an argumentum ad hominem. Aristotle, in his work Sophistical Refutations, detailed fallaciousness arguments that are disingenuous. You are arguing that because scientists were wrong in the past they must be wrong now. Trump made this same stupid

Damn you were good tonight.  You’re always must-see TV, but tonight you were particularly amazing. I wish ever Trump supporter would have heard you tonight.  Thank you!!!!
He really just wants Trump to come back to Portland because then he’ll be presented as a hero in the national media again. This will help Ted get big donations for his campaign and build the reputation needed to run for higher office someday. Ted can’t win without that publicity.

Trump will now take credit for popular things that Obama did. Except for the things his base of stick-it-to-the-libs trolls don't like.
I live in suburbs of Portland. Sorry, really getting tired of this. Nothing is being accomplished other than playing into the hands of Trump and making a total mess of a beautiful city.  The message has been lost.
Not to get to in depth or weird you out, but they have done studies on sociopaths and psychopaths and have found that they have underdeveloped amygdala's, meaning that these people are incapable of feeling shame or remorse, sort of like Donald Trump. lol

No the trump admin loosened regulations for nursing homes, like they were no longer required to have an infection specialist on site. And lobbyists are asking in FL to have full immunity from negligence and gross misconduct.
Only confirms that Trump can't read. The Affordable Care Act already requires insurers to cover preexisting conditions!
The ACA covers that already and Trump is suing to take it away.

Trump usually uses bribery or blackmail to turn people around like this. Wonder if  has a federal job waiting for him in Jan. He's clearly decided to tank the mayoral election.
This is a liar, lying about what the other liar is doing. Trump has been suing in court to remove the pre-existing condition coverage that Obamacare gives us.
And Obamacare is an overpriced epic fail. Trump will fix that in 2020!! Now ALL insurers must do it. Heck of a misleading headline. Not surprising.
And the last it happen it was an energetic candidate something Biden isn't... It would be interesting seeing Obama vs Trump election...

The whole “executive order” presidency of Trump is a reflection of a guy who mistakenly thinks he knows better than everyone else. He does not listen to anyone but screwballs like Sean Hannity. He has surrounded himself with unqualified, pathetic losers. A total bust 4 years.
Darwin’s Natural Selection in action. ⁦ followers can’t vote for him when they are dead from their own stupidity
Trump’s Executive actions won’t make him look decisive except to an idiot few. They are like a boss giving orders via memo to all the employees. He has no power of the purse behind him. He has no power over Congress period! So thanks to GOP once again Americans pay.

I am confident not debating Trump would be a mistake for Biden, he can be attacked on being so "fight me, ill debate 2 Trumps" 3 months ago. I also am confident debating Trump could be a mistake for Biden. Biden might say the N word in "solidarity" cause he is so black.   Ruh Roh

Of course, I'm not disagreeing with you, but looking at it objectively, Biden is having even MORE trouble talking. Trump being as bad at talking and Biden being even worse is what's scary
Honestly, if Trump keeps pulling stunts like that Bedminster mini-rally, (let's call it what it is,) it won't be too much longer before he tests positive for the Coronavirus himself.
"Conservative free speech" is spreading misinformation, outing whistle-blowers, and threatening violence against people they disagree with. See the difference? If Twitter really enforced its terms of service trump would be kicked off for all 3.

Watch, Trump's team is full of COVID. Someone in that club is going to get very sick.
Oh so Trump is one of those “Old Portland was better” guys.
Just stellar work . What was that about b roll for Trump's reelection campaign?
So I mailed my dad’s birthday card a week ago—from Portland to Seattle. He still hasn’t received it. Lost? Delayed? Trump?
Our Mayer speaking in Trump. 😂😂
That's already a part of ACA, (that's a law for the nitwits who take Trump ar his word). Health insurance companies *already cannot* refuse coverage to anyone regardless of a preexisting condition. Law, not easily reversed executive order.
“He’s come a long way” Trump on his new friend and propagandist Ted Wheeeler/Whalen.    🤝    By equating a garbage can fire to “murder” Ted Wheeler has further emboldened Trump and now endangers our city with a military occupation.
DeJoy just fired/reassigned a truckload of top USPS execs soon after Dems demand an investigation into the installation of DeJoy by tRump.Also the DNI’s new intel report on Russian election meddling by denigrating Biden thru social media &amp; R senators repeating those lies;so wrong
Yep, and don’t forget, Putin wants his $50-Million Dollar Penthouse in Trump Tower Moscow.
Sense Demoncrats want people to suffer Trump will step in with an executive order and save the day as always
Here we have the very definition of white privilege. Wealthy golfers flaunting NJ’s mask law at Trump’s presser, and booing the reporter who pointed that out. #WhitePrivilege #COVIDIOTS
So Trump might issue an EO for things Democrats wanted and Republicans wouldn't move on.  If so, either A: Democrats fight it in court and look bad, or  B: Trump can make it look like he's demanding those things of the Democrats and that they're immediately caving to him.
Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler Now Begs Criminal Antifa Terrorists to Stay Home So Trump Won't Use His Failed City in His Ads
They're a threat to Trump's bogus narrative.
Our current Mayor is being praised by the Trump administration for labeling all protesters murderers and arsonists. Our next Mayor knows that #BlackLivesMatter more than petty vandalism and will lead the community in rethinking how we spend (or waste) public funds on policing.
It's going to be funny watching all these die hard never Trumpers come around once the media flips and actuality starts praising Trump.  Everyone is going to have a huge slice of humble pie eventually.   We've been trying to tell them. They rather call us names and attack us.
Glad to hear it.  The man is another trump. Corrupt as hell.
Trump just told you all to go suck an egg! Lmfao! #MAGA2020
Yeah, he seems to feel that this behavior works for Trump, so it can/should work for him. I agree he comes off as pretty douchey.
STFU Biden has ties to Russia too
Trump just told you all go eat a.shit sandwich! Lmfao #MAGA2020
Schumer suddenly wants kids back in school, Ted wheeler is begging for the riots to stop in Portland because it’s helping Trump’s re-election. Biden thinks Tik Tok is a breath mint and they’re dragging out Oprah the billionaire to shame whitey. Holy shit. The left is imploding.
I am amazed it took him 3.5 years to "Trump Steaks" obamacare
No you schmuck. Donald Trump wants to disarm the IRS so we can ALL flourish! That will fix the problem wouldn’t it? Instead of pitting is against each other! #BernieSanders
If Trump thinks sending in the military to Portland is going to deter protesters, he's very mistaken.
Yes, we get it.  You just described like 50% of Trump supporters.
I know the world is scary in Trump, Q world, but here, we believe in facts. You’re in a cult, seek help.
Yeah, never mind the warehouses of supplies that country hid and didn’t let their people use just to show us how bad Trump is. Pffft! Damn paper towels.
It was the Trump admin the relaxed regulations for nursing homes. And deaths in red states are starting to catch up, look at FL, TX, LA, AL, MS, NC, SC, GA, TN...when all is said and done, we will see it's not just a blue state thing, it's everywhere dude.
needs to emphatically reject any help from China or Iran and vow to sanction them or any nation that interferes in U.S. elections, regardless of who it helps.  God knows Trump won’t do the same for Russia.
Bad take, HRC
Yep! The Trump kids will be collecting the cash, especially after they have daddy institutionalized.
do you think in 10 years there will be tv shows &amp; movies about the year we were all stuck inside because trump is an idiot
hey sleepy, Trump's calling you out! Hahahha lmao you ain't got a chance! Chump
Are you all watching Rachel Maddow?  Trump and the GOP are filthy filthy amoral pukes 🤮. They are the lowest of the low 🤬
Before Trump I never knew what the voice of a chronic masturbator sounded like. Now I do.
Why is the GOP not concerned about this affecting tRump's following. He's proven he's close to tRump and likely supports the same policies. I suspect a few younger Biden voters would vote for him, but I'd expect many more tRump voters would.
Trump's latest fundraising attempt is reportedly a Facebook scam against his own supporters
15,925 people have died in New Jersey since the pandemic began, and once again Trump proves that he literally has no clue how the SARS-2 virus spreads. Hard to believe anyone could be this willfully stupid, and reckless.
Russia’s helping Trump.  The GOP has confirmed that.
So Trump signed an E.O. for something that already existed? Thanks Obama! #ObamaCare
Trump says stupid things, but he finishes his sentences, not well mind you. But I think he means what he says. Biden keeps forgetting what he's saying. Gotta call a spade a spade. This is why they don't interview him much.
Honestly I think Biden is helping Trump more than Kanye is. 🤷🏽‍♂️
I’ve known this about him for basically my entire life.   Trump is a racist. Watch and retweet.  #VoteOutRacism
How do people still openly support trump I don’t get it!!!!!
Shhh don't tell the citizens the truth, Trump needs to look like he gave them something
So wait, #Trump wastes tax payer money on court costs to #DumpObamacare only to sign a #TrumpDecree to save #Obamacare?
Again, 15,925 people have died in New Jersey from COVID19, &amp; Trump still thinks it's all a big joke, because the laws don't apply to him and his sycophants. Virus schmirus, amirite? 🤬 #COVIDIOT #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Biden believes in infaticide and free, free, free everything.  Nothing is free.  Someone pays. Perhaps Trump is playing to his base by invoking God’s name but at least he has the courage to do it.   I was in Portland, OR today.
I agree that we have many problems that need to be fixed and Trump is trying to do just that.  Just remember freedom is not free.  Would you die for your country?
I as m a Republican, a Catholic and a Trump supporter.  I do not believe in cancel culture so don’t do it.  I have voted for a Democratic President before. Biden is a poor choice for America.  For one he is mentally declining and a puppet of the far left.
Yep! First the #TrumpliconParty gave us the typical Trickledown #Taxscam. Now with the COVID-19 the Taxpayer cash floodgates are wide opened, and it’s sickening how Trump is throwing cash at corporations, especially the pharmaceutical industry &amp; what’s with $765 million to Kodak?
Had the USFL kept its originally modest aims intact and stayed a spring league and didn't expand from its original number of teams it might have survived. Better quality of play than the early AFL for one thing IMHO. But Trump bullied the other owners into taking on the NFL
So, Trump is a globalist?
It kinda freaks me out that  has us all figured out! I seriously didn’t know that trump was a “cosmopolitan “. I always thought he was just a jackass.
HUGE NEWS Trump invents Obamacare
Again, can't make this stuff up folks. In the middle of a global pandemic, in a state where 15,925 people have died, this 👇 was the scene for Trump's presser today at his Bedminster, New Jersey country club today. 🤬 #TrumpHasNoPlan #COVIDIOT
This nigga Joe Biden and the DNC trying to get Trump re-elected.   If Kanye West is “stealing” votes from the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.. well that says more about them than him. 🤷🏽‍♂️
This isn’t a q&amp;a either. I’m not taking questions from traitorous trump lovers.
This is so important that every American know what's happening with the USPS. Trump and his cronies are actively and deliberately destabilizing the Postal Service at a time when it's critical for us in our ability to exercise our right to vote.
Preexisting conditions are covered in Obamacare.  Trump lies so damn much.  He needs to be confronted about being in court trying to remove Obamacare.  He doesn’t even have a replacement plan.  He’s just a fraud. Time to send him packing.
So Trump has finally come around to defending Obamacare, which covered pre-existing conditions since 2012? Why is he still suing to stop Obamacare??? Idiot.
Look's like Trump talked with Putin about a re-election strategy!
Too stupid to research facts describes a trump supporter to a T! You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, there's always time to get an education so you can see the con man reality show host for what he is, the most corrupt pres ever
Yes, being a Trump and Tucker supporter is *really* fucked up.
And  is talking about her right now &amp; wow should she be disbarred immediately for helping Kanye Kardashian-Stein help Trump in Wisconsin 🤬 #ElectionFraud #maddow
“Wall teddy”...why didn’t I see that back in Jsnuary? Probably because the Department of Trump’s Security Blanket was conducting some outrage or other.
I never mentioned Russia. Since you did, how about those bounties Russia put on our soldier's heads that Trump has ignored, yet spoken to Putin a half dozen times since? Trump talks harsher of dems than Putin, our actual adversary. Trump also believes Putin over our intelligence

So Trump endorses Obamacare. Got it.
I am curious her thoughts on today's big announcement that trump is signing and executive order ensuring you can get health insurance even if you have pre-existing conditions
Let’s ask Donald Trump which clause.  He isn’t doing anything right now, and he has Barr and other minions who spend their time looking up answers for him.
I have a feeling the closer Trump gets to winning, the more this will happen with a lot of accounts. It has happened to me on a smaller scale. #demorats
Trump has been a disaster for decades. Basically since birth.
Man if the news said eating lead paint was bad for you, but Trump said it’s not, conservatives would just start downing paint claiming fake news and Trump is a genius. That’s how this virus is being treated.
The Trump administration is the disaster.
The ones wearing face masks are probably only wearing them to hide their identities because they're too embarrassed to be known as tRump supporters.
A great read by "The Intelligencer" highlighting the chrrent state that the election is in with impending interference from multiple countries. November is going to be a powderkeg, we must tread carefully.
China is doing fine..dismantling Trump and the United States Trump Tariffs= Trumpvirus
So rich he owes billions to a known Russian laundering bank🙄. So rich his fixer testified under oath about how he commonly commits tax fraud. Trump openly &amp; blatantly breaks laws + collects tax dollars every time he stays at his properties. A corrupt pres should be worried about
Trump is owned by Russia and does not care about Americans or the Intelligence Community. He cares about  one person: himself.
You don't even know the proper name. It's the Trump Virus. #TrumpVirus
So you're against open borders then?   Millions of Americans need jobs right now and  wants open borders and free healthcare for all illegals. Shouldn't Americans be taken care of first?  So why do you think you hate Trump?
The largest dumbass, trump.
When you've got Trump pleased with you, you know you're doing your people wrong.
Replace "mob" with "COVID-19" and "Ted Wheeler" with "Donald Trump" and it gets truthier.
this story does not mention the senate majority leader one time. after the last two weeks, the only explanation is that the omission is intentional.
"No need to bring up how horrible Trump is"  —  I so agree. Can we just do other actions? #BlackLivesStillMatter Like, we know who we're voting for president.   What abt down-ballot? #WriteInTeressaRaiford &amp; other campaigns. Vote for progressive Black women activists.
Trump is the main source of the energy we pick up on.  He is dumb, and closed minded.  I am sure there are many good politicians, however, they are all under the umbrella we call Trump, you included.
After all, Trump has been receiving Russian money since the 1980s.  He went from being a creature living on his father’s fortune to being one laundering money for Russian mobsters and for Putin’s oligarchs.
You can't just sign orders for things that have been law for years. Whats next? Trump integrates the military? Trump signs an emancipation order to free the slaves? Trump signs order to build a transcontinental railroad?
We all know that this is a Trump campaign tactic so he can just create the stimulus via exec order to be a hero right before the election, right?
It’s almost like  and Trump are on the same page about their opinions on protestors...all that matters to #teargasted is which cops are using brutality against the protestors
You only believe that because trump tells you that!
. &amp; his terrible negotiators  &amp;  are pushing us into a severe recession because they DO NOT Care about average Americans suffering during #COVID__19. Trump can't fix this unilaterally with EO. They got theirs, so screw us peons.
It was sweet revenge for them for the film “Charlie Wilson’s War” and the events on which that was based, the U.S. arming Afghans who killed Russians when THEY were there. Only Trump’s financial info will confirm whether he had been a long term project, which seems likely.
CTRL+F locates zero mentions of "mitch mcconnell" and one mention of "senate republicans" insisting that a larger bill will never pass their chamber, something we don't know, because it hasn't been brought to the floor.
Also: the Dems have like a gazillion anti Trump talking points. Believe me. 🙄

Trump’s supposed to be President of the United States! Instead, Donnie is entertaining millionaires at his Country Club while doing a really good impersonation of Al Czervik!
Trump's failing mental acuity is as important as Bidens.  And Conservatives harp on Biden's every misspoken word as evidence of Alzheimers.
Love this idea. Trump loves money as much as he hates Obama. A twofer!
“When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” – Donald Trump, February 26, 2020  The U.S. now has 5,095,277 confirmed cases and 164,093 deaths from COVID-19.  Well done Donnie Dipsh*t!
"Send the military to Portland", which translates as: Let them come outside of the Federal courthouse they already occupy downtown?  Trump is glitching hard
Those are reasons *not* to vote for Trump. I can avoid voting for Trump just as easily if I vote for Hawkins or Jorgensen. In the possible-worlds where the Democratic nominee was Warren, Yang, Harris, Booker, or Sanders, it still would’ve been possible to vote against Trump.
We are headed for a crisis. Where is the federal response? What has Trump done to help average people? I’ll wait.
this is the company I told you about making those awesome Trump ads. Check them out!
So when is Trump gonna lock her up? He's been President for over 3 years and he hasn't charged Clinton with any crimes.

There were other candidates that were not Trump in the primary. I think I was very clear about that.  Also, Howie Hawkins is not Trump and will be on my ballot. He will likely earn my vote based on Biden’s track record so far, but he does have a couple months left.
Yes, I am stereotyping. 44% of Catholics voted for Hillary.  It does aggravate me that 52% of Catholics voted for Trump. I will never forgive those 52%.
This right here ties into the media's low key complicity. Even here, even now, Trump is given a pass and his impromptu rally on his property is referred to as a "news conference." The #MSM has to do a hell of a lot better.       #TrumpMeltdown

I think it is GREAT to see an attempt by Trump to commandeer MSNBC air time for a campaign bull session fail, when not only is it not carried live, but no tape is shown later. My only complaint is that Trump’s claque was shown wearing masks handed out belatedly.

Trump and the GOP are in a dead sprint to authoritarianism. America is fierce in its opposition to these traitors, and we are loyal to the ideals of our founding.
Proud of Joy Ann Reid that she didn’t show trump at his golf course presser talking to his white, male, rich members. It just makes my head spin.
Seeding for post Trump political standing
Stop feeding the Lincoln Project and the other "conservative" Never Trump Republicans. They hate unions just as much as Trump does.
Remember, Mike Cohen blackmailed him into endorsing Trump due to previous hotwife shenanigans.
I have &amp; it's clear, Trump is the most corrupt pres ever. You cheer a reality show host that has thrown out every ideal the GOP supposedly stood for. Bravo. While he does nothing to stop a raging pandemic that he initially called a hoax. Stop watching Fox news, it rots the brain
I think that’s trump when putin releases his peepee tape!
Can trump stop scraping the bottom of the barrel with his lunatic actions. While people suffer, he’s at his golf course with his rich asshole members holding a press conference.  I just can’t take any more of this.

Good point, Trump might want to avoid walking near any high windows for the time being, just in case.
I've done both blue &amp; white collar work in my life, but I prefer what I have now: Purple! I'm an artist &amp; I do what I love. It took a long time to get here &amp; that's why tRump needs to go. I'm not letting him screw up what's left of our futures. We can create our own jobs w/ UBI.

I'm just glad Portland is getting called out after all these years of unfair, illicit, and pure corrupt Democrat controlled opression. Trump has been amazing in so many ways.
NPD is a personality disorder and that’s what I believe trump has and that does have an impact of these types of decisions. I agree, people should learn the difference.
When you’ve won over Trump you’ve lost the city of Portland.
No it's called reading, and I read things like the Mueller report which evidenced multiple offenses that Trump could be indicted for, yet he wasn't cuz you can't indict a sitting pres. Just wait til he's not pres any longer tho!
Nothing. They would just say he’s still better than Trump and that’s ALL that matters. What they fail to understand is that’s all that matters to THEM. Other people have higher standards.
Three religious groups that support Trump &amp; the GOP mystify me: Evangelicals, Catholics, &amp; Mormons. These religions tolerate lying, cheating, &amp; Trump. There is nothing pious, ethical, or moral about that. Go to hell.
Schiff is trying to ensure our elections aren’t influenced by a foreign country:
It was already a mandate when Obama passed it. Then Trumps leagal team fought it in court saying it’s unconstitutional. So you prefer instead of CONGRESSIONAL approval through DEMOCRATIC process, you prefer King Trump shove it down what he fought to repeal?
Glad to hear Trump FINALLY announce he agrees with President Obama on something!
Everyone who praised Trump's "change in tone" a week or two again.. FUCK YOU!
Can’t believe this got so many likes...on second thought I get it: people who can’t figure out you could give working class a tax cut without the rich also getting the same vote for Trump.
And yet  tried to claim it was protesters that were giving Trump footage. Looks like it was actually his own rhetoric that gave Trump an excuse for martial law.
For the record: She is feeling better but cannot go back to work until she gets the results. She’s says “Dad, I need to get back to work. This is crazy.”   Trump is a monster. And we need this to end. Biden will at least set our course in the right direction. He’s our only hope.

Actually trump wanted a reduction/elimination of the payroll tax. Republicans in Congress didn’t agree that it would be possible so went a different route. You should really keep up on current events in politics as to not risk sounding ignorant.
The point of what he was saying is that schools need billions to reopen and we need to find that. Trump isn't doing that. You seem to consistently miss the details in favor of politics. Weird.

Trump knew about #COVID19 in NOVEMBER 2019.  Trump called covid19 a "democratic hoax" February 2020  Trump has been saying, since MARCH 2020, the virus will "just go away".  Trump is killing Americans.
What does any of that have to do with who the larger threat to the 2020 election is? You’ve yet to refute his points.  1. Trump seeks to equalize to two for shady reasons. 2. Chinese attacks are forward facing.(I took that to mean propaganda) 3. The WSJ  isn’t a liberal source.
Trump is rhe one who also brokered a lame duck trade deal with China. He can't enforce it and the money recouped from the deal doesn't even cover the initial losses the US incurred from the trade war.
What’s appalling is the idea that bc Trump is such a threat to democracy, Democrats are the ones who should compromise in order to get him out of office.
Funny.  I thought Trump wasn't the constitutionalist.  As the Federal branch, he has encrouched on the 1st and the 10th Amendment. DHS has already admitted they have been detaining people in Portland counter to their constitutional rights.
It’s astonishing that Republicans like Matt Lewis genuinely believe they should suffer no policy setbacks bc their party nominated, actively helped elect, and enabled Donald Trump.
Trump and Bannon's quest to dismantle the government comes to the post office. Terrifying stuff, with consequences the whole country is experiencing right now as the mail doesn't show up.
Golf course employees have been forced to join the claque of millionaires, to add “diversity”. Find out whether their performances are being graded, or their paychecks held until after Trump’s Potemkin public health campaign speech.
my money’s on them claiming Trump was a Democrat in disguise
Fear is not respect---the way we ended up with someone like Trump was too many parents teaching their children that respect equals fear.
Trump is not aware of the NATO guidelines callings the "fees." Countries aren't required to contribute 2%. It's a guideline only. Also, Germany has been increasing it contributions and will continue to do so.  Trump is only weakening NATO to please Putin.
The more conservatives I follow the more twitter hates me....that's my goal . Fuck twitter TRUMP 2020

we have a virtual cornucopia of right wing candidates to choose from for president in 2020. biden, kanye, jorgenson, AND trump? we are lousy with right wing choices who won't threaten capital or the status quo.
Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays Trump’s henchmen from the swift deconstruction of American democracy.
My God, Trump is forcing golf club employees to join his claque of millionaires, to “beef it up” and to add diversity.
This is such a pile of horse manure. She thinks Trump might be worthy of a vote?          SE Cupp reveals what Biden must do to earn her vote
It’s complicated for me bc I think Trump’s crassness is a negative on top of everything. Though it goes back farther than his presidency. I remember the overt racism/misogyny of Limbaugh in the early ‘90s.
Trump says by EO, UI is extended through year end , along with eviction moratorium &amp; stud loans forgiven. No specs what levels.  Payroll tax cut but unclear if will undermine SS or Medicare. He expresses sympathy for Lebanon but non for victims of #COVID19 #trumppresser

Do we think there is a strong correlation between Trump supporters and those that support The Empire (Star Wars)? Wish there was some research done on this. Because yes I am into random research like this.
The press is suffering through every press conference because they had to fight for their right to attend. Trump has been against having media represented since the beginning of his presidency. When the media has something changed last-minute, they do what they can and report.

I wonder if the World Court could put trump and his pals on trail for the putting children in cages, lying about the Virus, that is killing people, here in the United States, so far around 100,000 people have died here in the USA and not caring and any other crime I can think of
Parody video!  Watch!  It makes about as much sense as Trump’s answers to the original interview!
How early in his campaign did Putin tell trump about Pence?
Trump should 🤐
We are suffering as many deaths every single hour, thanks to the #TrumpVirus, as there were in the Beirut explosion today.  Far from trying to minimize that disaster, I am trying to convey the magnitude of our own disaster, with Trump as our "leader."

Breaking News: President Trump is signing Executive Order on banning texting while driving!! He’s such a leader, he’s going to save so many lives!!
Am I missing something?? Obama care already covers pre-existing conditions. Is trump signing a fake executive order? He does know that it’s already covered, right?
Trump’s tendencies maybe warrant the comparison like comparing a boxing match to full scale war—they’re both violent fights, but that’s about it.  Implying generally that China and the U.S. at large are similar in degree or kind is gaslighting IMO.
If Trump were running against Jesus, how would he attack him?
It’s old Karl Rove tactic: take the quality of an opponent they are most admired for, and turn it into an attack. Trump just perfected it. Remember scoffing at McCain for getting captured?
I don't know which is more concerning:  Either Trump doesn't understand he's signing an EO that requires insurance companies to do what they are already doing, or that #Trumpsters will believe the BS he's peddling.
BREAKING: Trump signs Executive Order banning COVID-19. Claims, “health and prosperity in our time!”
It’s quite clear what Trump is doing. He signs an EO that does the same thing as the ACA so he can claim it is his EO that provides those benefits.
3. ...his MAGAt Christian base would be upset and not so eager to vote if such “impeccable” information became known to the public and Trump was exposed as the fraud and absolute self indulgent drug addict heathen he is and was.   #TrumpProstitutePissParty

Argument to discount the findings of the CIA, FBI, NSA, Military Intelligence and Homeland that the Russians were behind the DNC hack, interferes in the 2016 election to help Trump. Trump argued that since these agencies weee wrong about WMD in Iraq they were wrong now. This
What you are doing here is making an argumentum ad hominem. Aristotle, in his work Sophistical Refutations, detailed fallaciousness arguments that are disingenuous. You are arguing that because scientists were wrong in the past they must be wrong now. Trump made this same stupid
I live in suburbs of Portland. Sorry, really getting tired of this. Nothing is being accomplished other than playing into the hands of Trump and making a total mess of a beautiful city.  The message has been lost.
Trump only wants to give the appearance of action to keep his base fired up and give the GOP &amp; Fox News talking points to distract from Covid-19 and BLM. He does not care if he actually accomplishes anything except his reelection.
Oh and isn't this the same ACA, Obamacare, the Trump and Bill Barr are trying to have overturned in court right now
Peloton, painting walls, building furniture and despising Trump.
True, but other agencies must keep arrest and deportation records. Theoretically one could attempt to match the data. But I guess Trump is just using BS to appease his base.
The priveledged white country club crowd.  Not exactly the demographic that Trump has been pandering to for the last 4 yrs.  Pay attention rural high school educated people.  In the end, he does not give a s***t about you.  You are just his pawns.
You and Trump have Fox and Russia. We the people need to have Fair elections. Oh wait, I forgot you don't care about that at all. You are Putin's puppet.
Wow the Axios Trump interview was a lot of fun!
Actually the same attorney who filed his paperwork to run in Wisconsin is the one on the court filing where the Trump campaign is suing the little tiny Wisconsin TV station that ran an ad that he didn't like
Biden has not made his platform on being Catholic. Trump made fun of him for a picture of him praying. The hypocrisy on this thread is amazing. Joe is pro choice, not pro abortion. Big distinction that you all wouldn't be able to comprehend

If you don't vote, or don't vote for  you're effectively voting for Trump.  America and the rest of the World can not have another 4 years of Trump and his GOP enablers.

What she is saying, and many other people believe, is that four more years of Trump and a better Dem candidate in 2024, is less deadly than 4 years of Biden and 8 of Tom Cotton after Trump.  That's what you need to argue against if you disagree.
Even trump knows this isnt a political issue its very wealthy people using the democratic platform to initiate the sequence of the destruction of america along with a covert mission to vaccinate the entire planet once again the united states in not exclusive to this practice.
And a Trump presidency promises a lot more dead Americans.
Why cant people see the trump administration is the last line of defense when it comes to attaining what makes this country great.
Anybody for trump follow somebody else for trump and let's get this shit movin ladies and gentlemen this isnt a cartoon or some fantasy we are in the biggest fight of our adult lives.
Which would make everyone who endorsed Biden a Russian puppet too. Are these libs trying to re-elect Trump?

Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Doesn't matter. They're looking for a bump just to get them to November so checks will go out to desperate Americans with Trump's signature on them.
Trump with the help of certain people have already made the connections and as we speak are preparing to make an unprecedented amounts of arrests that is why twitter and facebook have blocked people we are all talking to each other and they dont like it
he should have been fired after saying this "A poor person never gave anyone a job. A poor person never gave anybody charity, not of any real volume. It’s just common sense to me."
What do you think people don't know about Trump? And are those people following Brie?
I hope everyone sees what's going on here. The White House never planned to cut a deal with the Dems.  The idea here is to have Trump issue executive orders and be the hero.  McConnell is in on it. Remember he privately visited the White House alone yesterday.
Pssst...I’m not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the “culprit” (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn’t take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
Could you guys do an ad about the fact that Trump and his cronies are trying to take away Medicare, social security, and Medicaid.
Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
Donald Trump’s Latest Campaign Tactics Are Idiotic And Absurd?? His Desperation Is On Full Display? So Certainly He’ll Try To Cheat Or Steal The Election, However I Really Believe The American People Are Wise To His Antics Now. He Knows The Clock Is Running Out Soon. Very Soon!!!
the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
Yet it is only Putin that Trump is having regular conversations with and refusing to allow accurate readouts of the calls.
Trump denigrates 60% of the country daily - he’s not trying to win over new supporters; just keep the ones he has.  Supporters are slipping through his fingers as he continues pushing people away.  He may set a All-Time Record with Worst Defeat in Presidential History!  MAGA
Donald Trump’s Marriage Is A Sham, Pure And Simple. Melania Doesn’t Really Love Or Even Like Her Husband; His Cheating With Porn Stars, Etc. Has To Have Taken A Toll??????? She Is Just Bought And Paid For And That Is Really Creepy Don’t You Think? She’s A Trophy Wife That’s All!!
Well that's pretty hypocritical.
Trump was already corrupt, he corrupted power.
True that, Trump blocked Chinese Air travel early on, Getting bashed by the Left "Pelosi/Biden" which they ultimately retracted their comments and praised Trump for quick swift Action. -
But what did Brianna do?  I saw that about SE Cupp, who is ridiculous, but I don't think she said she would vote for Trump I think she said she would write in a candidate.
What happened? She's been getting a lot of good press for not putting up with BS from Trump surrogates.

Then I'm sure you agree that Trump should be held responsible for the death of 160,000 Americans and counting.
Let's hope your fellow Trump supporters here don't make bond.
Congratulations you just made the argument that Donald Trump should be indicted.
Mark Meadows is a Trump Traitor Tea Pantie hack
Neither do you. You and other trump supporters are guilty of spreading his lies on Facebook &amp; Twitter.
Someone of Trump's qualifications should include reading abobe a 7th grade level. Wharton my ass. Trump would fuck up a Lemonade stand
Of course. Everything the Trump Cabal does is illegal..eventually
You heard the felon.   Trump is a coastal elite that's out-of-touch.
Rich coming from Trump propaganda princess Eeewwww
There are many groups that have done the same. (And if you're a Trump supporter, what a contradiction.) Some bad priests over the many, many years does not speak for the thousands of fantastic priests out there. Sorry, but your argument is irrelevant. 🤔
Saying That Joe Biden Is Against God Is Not Only Not True But Is Blasphemous!!!! Donald Trump Holding The Bible Upside Down For A Photo Op Is Sacrilegious?? I Would Bet $1,000.00 That Trump Has Never Read A Single Passage Of Scripture In His Life??? So The Religious Right What??!
LMAO, you're bending yourself into a pretzel trying to make sense of this ridiculous tweet from a Fox News employee and Trump campaign staffer.
A Fox News National Security ✌️ expert ✌️and Trump campaign staffer.. Kevin Bacon's himself to try and find a way to blame Obama for the Beirut explosion. 🙄
Putin had nothing to do with trump getting elected its actually been proven. And obama and hillary clinton are under indictments for spying on a presidential campaign. U been in the basement hidin with joe biden?
Trump you sent federal police in to cause anarchy- tear gassing non violent protestors demanding equality for black lives!
Right, the "no overtime" policy (note that 20% of all mail delivery is delivered via overtime) and no extra delivery trip policies that Trump mega-donor implemented that is directly responsible for slower delivery times.. is the fault of the workers. 🙄
What is this all about???  “So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you’ll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I’m doing,” said Trump.
I’m as Anti-Trump as I could be - but this is just Foolishness...  You want to act in the same manner as those you criticize? Really?  The term “backfire” comes mind...
Huge concern about Trump's racist history which is all over out there and continues on a daily basis. Huge concern about Trump's failure to lead in a pandemic.
Your daily reminder that Donald Trump is a fucking bitch
Trump can’t string a sentence!!!!  He’s a failed business man like he’s failed America! Trump uses threats and violence to get his way... wonder if we will hear the coccaine snorts again during the Presidential debates!!
Distancing isn't that difficult..if I spoke about it, our relationships would be done.. Understanding how..same parents, same schools other than college.  4 and 6 years older is the key, I think. They profess love, live promoting Trump hate or something..Beyond my comprehension
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
He’s not blaming Trump?

So the Republican argument that the House should have gone to the courts to force Trump to honor subpoenas for documents and witnesses during impeachment wasn't a realistic one.  Schiff was 100% correct.  No chance McGahn testifies because the subpoena expires in January.
Deflection. They aren't the ones deciding to implement policies to purposely slow down the mail.  Trump's partisan mega-donor is doing that.
Bottom line is that Trump was successful in ensuring McGahn won't provide testimony until after the election, and also destroys the argument from Republicans that the House should have gone to the courts to get testimony and documents during impeachment after being blocked.
Trump can't even pronounce the major countries yet as he is still practicing to be president.
Bottom line is that you and Trump are perfectly happy with the rising death rate because they're just numbers and don't mean anything? So you're OK with a city the size of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, or Vancouver, WA, going extinct w/160000 people?  We're not. These are moms, dads, etc.
Major Republican operative and partisan Trump mega-donor who has no experience in mail delivery pinky swears that he won't do what he's already admitted to doing.
everything you say and do is going to be criticized and torn apart.  People who support Trump are chomping at the bit for this - really hope you and your Administration are going to be ready

I care desperately for people to quit allowing neolibs to define the choices for you. It is not Trump or Biden unless you fall for that.
LMAO, other than Omar they were all born here in the USA.  Just like campaign finance criminal Donald "Individual One" Trump.
So  had the senior officer of the National Guard unit that cleared the street for the #OrangeTroll’s Bible beating photo op on. He doesn’t like Trump and he attacked troop withdrawals in Germany.  Joe never asked why he obeyed an illegal order to attack protesters.
I would just love for him to attend a mask-less church service In Mississippi!
Lapierre is a grifter of nearly trump level thieving.  To think of all those NRA members who thought thier money was going to hate, racism and violence... Instead, he was taking the cash for himself. Bummer, eh?
yeah no, i’m saying compared to the 50 million they stated. 5 million is still a ludicrous amount and indicative of a terrible response by trump and the entire US government, as well as the general populace’s insistence to not wear a mask. it’s fucked up
This is what Trump fans want you to belive but it is revisionist history. Trump fans number one driving motivation in voting for him was his overt racism.  via
Oh thank goodness Trump Tests are phucked up too
To out right election rigging. Similarly GOP issues have always been rooted in racism but before Trump they took efforts to disguise by pushing valid policy aims to advance racism. States rights is really code for Jim Crow laws and circumventing Civil Rights legislation
Ideology, religious issues, gun rights while paying homage to the 1 % donor class. GOP bass don’t understand policy and cast their vote for the most religious on the ballot.  GOP have used voter ID laws, Gerrymandering to prevent the democratic process for years till Trump turned
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
well shit, imagine how trump feels about the hypocrisy he receives.
And Trump's likes saying he's first and best at everything. Let's give him what he deserves.
Thank you, President Trump for all your hard work. There are a lot of us who pray for you and your family every day. Stay safe!
I think Trump only likes white meat.
Trusting polls in what got us Trump in the first place.   Vote, get your friends/family registered, and ignore the polls!
support AG！ trump 2020！
I would not put it past them to lie about the negative tests so the news can't report on another Trump supporter getting Covid-19. We'll see how long they stay quarantined.
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
What the actual fuck?  Tell me exactly how Trump is viewed by the majority of Americans, regardless of ethnicity/race?
Shame on you, Donald Trump.  US response under your watch has been a disaster.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? 😅 Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
It’s simple, even for a simpleton. It’s America or Trump. If you can’t figure that out, there’s no help for you.
Isn't her dad George Conway? He acts more like a progressive than a conservative and certainly is no fan of Trump.
And have Trump win?
Including Trump?
My state of Oregon has had vote-by-mail for more than ten years.  Hoping more states can implement VBM.  Notwithstanding Trump's tactics to strangle the US Postal Service.
What the heck are you talking about? Are you a racist? Because that's the only reason people vote for Trump.
Why is he so uniquely special? He’s doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden’s help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say “Trump” in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
During a pandemic that has killed 159,000+ Americans, Trump has decided to ban Fortnite and an app where people dance.
That was not the intention of the bill.that was what Trump and his cronies turned it into with no oversight allowed
Maybe he is talking about "Poles", since their recent referendum regarding LGBTQ rights was passed. More in line with the brand. Also, it is statistically impossible for the Trump family to NOT have that "bachelor" uncle or 50 yr old aunt with a decades long "roommate."
Trump issues executive order banning TikTok from operating in 45 days if it's not sold by Chinese parent company

I’m not a practicing Catholic, but Joe is. Any Catholic voting for Trump after this statement should examine their conscience.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trump broadly prohibits unspecified `transactions' with Chinese owners of TikTok and WeChat via executive order. -

I wonder how trump would pronounce quiche. 🤔
I want to see Dinesh defend Trump pronouncing Ibiza.
He has made it onto the ballot in OK. He made the deadline for WI, WEC is reviewing signatures, he filed today in Ohio. This is being financed by the Trump campaign. HRC lost WI bye 30k votes, so that is what R are hoping for again.

The only thing positive about Trump’s presidency is everyone’s Covid tests
Artificial spikes. It made no sense that with what's going on in this country cut the stock market has not been significantly down. that's also why Trump keep saying that if the Dems come in the market will crash. He has it set up to do just that. Suspect real estate will dive.
In America we all have Freedom of Speech even Pres Trump. Kneeling during our Nat'l Anthem is offensive to many. Why offend your customers?
I greatly respect  and I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, but the words "binary choice" are just wrong. There are at least three candidates for President better than both Trump and Biden.  #NeverTrump #NeverBiden

There's a joke in here about Thighland, Trump, and the Yellow River (which is in China), but I'm not putting the pieces together.
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Not Republicans but Trump's lawyers!  He is trying to divide the votes to keep Biden from a victory.
LOL, where were YOU when Trump added $2T to the deficit to shower his rich cronies with massive tax cuts?
Trump 2020🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mitt Romney hasn't capitulated to Trump, but not because he's braver than the other Republicans, it's only because it won't endanger his seat like it will the others.
It does mean never a Republican that voted against removing Trump.  And right now that's nearly all.
That was a ridiculous pimping of Trump Corruption Cabal Shame on you for allowing the liar to spew his bs
Maybe because after 8 years of you, and 3 years of Trump where you set him up for a slam dunk. We are now the 2nd worst place to raise a family. You killed millions of innocent people and are a war criminal. Young people are educated, that’s part of the problem, we see your BS.Damn, you were the only account I followed on there 😂 Might get more active on it to spite Trump though.
Trump's ordering Obamacare? That's a MAJOR turnaround!
I wanna know who's running those shows. Building the stage specifically.   Also, I can't believe 3 Doors Down isn't playing . They are fully impacted up Trump's canal.
I'm actually not a Russia-gater, so not Vlad personally, but I do think Trump's done a lot of money-laundering for some sectors of the Russian oligarchy (via Deutchebank loan guarantee, for example).
The release of undersea methane farts big enough to 'splode a port city is also a "force of nature" (plus anthropogenic global warming), but that doesn't mean it can debate for sht.

so tired of seeing “trump 2020” on my TL—like jesus christ we get it. You love a racist, misogynistic, homophobic man!!!!!!!!🙄
Dear Diary,  President Trump told a room full of people the truth today,  that the MSM are nothing but liars. He hurt my feelings and made me cry.
Are we in a Twilight Zone or something? They can’t be serious and try to credit trump for that...
Only Biden has said crappy things about the Black Community!!! Trump has Helped!!!
Agreed. He gets away with everything. No one can stop him. I’m thinking of doing my best not to hear any more trump news until he’s gone. Can’t take anymore.
You're a little late there, President Trump has already brought jobs back, had record low employment, didn't sell us out to China and put America first. Joe can't do anything President Trump hasn't already done. Keep up Kamala Joe won't be President ever.
Trump is launching an all out attack on our democracy and constitution.

Everytime I open twitter I see this. Its a sneaky way of voter caused propaganda i apmost tweetes with it many times this and #  trump has.   No plan is another sneaker
advocates for the removal of every last one of them. Vote then all out.   I completely agree. They are forever stuck with the stinch of trump. The Republican party can surely do better.
Thank you President Trump!!
I’ve often thought that Sen. Ron Johnson was not very smart. Now I know he is not only not smart he is corrupt. He is like a second class Russian Puppet in the Senate. Trump is Pupper # one. What a shame that we have Russia interfering with our election again. #TrumpRussia

Trump’s political crony managing the #USPS has made significant changes to postal operations, which has already slowed mail delivery across the country. Tonight he went further and executed a Friday night massacre— firing USPS managers who run the day to day postal operations.

Trump added 4.4 TRILLION to the debt and another 400 BILLION to the deficit before we even HEARD of Covid19.

trump says #TikTok is a national security threat? That's hilarious 🤣. At no time in our country's 250-year history have we seen a bigger security threat than donald trump. He's literally letting Russia in through the front door.

Not to mention that the President has nothing to do with evictions. I bet Trump wishes he actually had all this power to do half the things he's accused of doing. Lol

Hey Mitch if you and the GOP took your head’s out of TRUMP’S A** you would find those bills sitting on your desk STOP LYING!
People on the left keep saying that Trump is taking away rights and trying to be a dictator, but it was the governors who actually suspended Constitutional rights without due process. I wrote in last time rather than vote for either one. The left pushed me to vote Trump now.
Compare that focus with those “on the left” who—two associate Justices ago—proclaimed that a term of Trump would hasten their “revolution.”
It is almost as if faith to you is as simple as one thing... while ignoring literally every other thing. Why does Trump get to pick and choose?
How exactly is Trump a failure in business? Really? Learn some facts before you reply. Manipulate his position? How's that? You must have some facts. Right? I'd love to see those facts.
Trump is just mad cause TikTok users clowned him at his "Lets Infect the South" rally.
“Ivanka’s $4 million haul tops the $1.7 million that Warren raised for Biden last Friday. But, in June, Warren brought in $6 million for Biden in his largest single-event to date.”  Ivanka’s $4m haul is larger than Kamala’s largest Biden fundraiser😞

Trump is okay with aborting kids.Letting some kids die by going back to school before it is safe. Trump aborting older adults by putting the golden calf economy above human life. Trump has extended abortion from the fetus to the living.
I can’t and won’t give up on America I fought for her and no one is going to take her down Trump is a traitor a corrupt business man which should tell you everything you need to know
Trump is corrupt Trump is impeached trump is a traitor Trump has killed 150,000+ Americans what more do you need to know  Oh wait he is a reality tv star with No experience...there you have it!
"A constant of the Trump administration has been escalation in the absence of accountability." It's time for some accountability, America. Don't worry. It won't be that bad. Creating a just society is good for all of us.
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.

Noooo... Biden and Trump are propaganda puppets put in office to keep you from thinking about things like cancer clusters and who we gave 27 TRILLION dollars to.
He read the rest of it, dude. Your point=💩. No matter what you Tweet, it looks like this:  Trump won. I hate Trump. Boo hoo.

What has the Right become? Tarrifs are bad unless Trump benefits. Regulation is bad unless Trump benefits. Dignifying dictators is bad unless Trump benefits. Gun control is bad unless it's Trump who wants to circumvent due process and take a man's firearms. So very sad.
And is the reason 30% of the electorate still supports Trump. Some of the 30% are probably just evil, but most are ignorant and too limited to know it. Very sad.
What are you smoking? Trump has been calling for us to open up for months and the governors decided they have the authority to suspend Constitutional rights on their own. It's going to take years and multiple court cases to rein them back in. Please get your facts straight.
Brah... Trump added almost 5 trillion to the debt and another 500 billion to the deficit before we even HEARD of COVID19...  But Truthfully Trump is just a circus act anyways...  THE POINT is: I think you KNOW you are ignoring the obvious.
This is one of the cases Trump would slam Kamala Harris for:   She declined to pursue a weapons charge on a known MS-13 gang member who brutally executed an entire family in SF just 2 months later. There are more stories like this.
Warren is the most popular female Democrat at the moment. Her brand of economic populism is popular amongst the anti-establishment voters that helped elect Trump in 2016  Harris is a much easier target. The capital punishment cases alone would be a nightmare to relitigate
Nothing in the age of Trump can compete with this for surrealism.
May your spouse be as faithful as Trump, your children as honest and moral, and may all of your business partners be as ethical as he is. And, may your future happiness &amp; success be directly proportional to how much Trump truly cares about anyone other than himself.
It's sad and pathetic but also somewhat entertaining to see these people absolutely debase themself to pretend Trump is perfect

“Facebook removed from Trump’s official account the post of a video clip from a Fox News interview in which he said children are “almost immune” from covid-19.”
Warning ⚠️ Trump will do or say anything to get re-elected remember this scum bag is already impeached
It’s been sitting on your desk like every piece of legislation on keeping our elections fair and free from corruption and foreign interference! You’re lying, you’re always lying to the people while lining your pockets. Trump is a dumb monster and you’re the Dr.Fraudenstien!
Ha ha ha Trump wins again
Just like the Trump Criminal Network is trying to destroy America, if Trump was re-elected as President your GREAT AMERICAN DREAM doesn’t have a chance. Your money, home and life will be taken away, immediately and without notice. No guilt, no sensibility! TRUMP LIES WE DIE!
We must remember and never forget Trump is an impeached President he is a traitor a racist is corrupt to the max is killing people and keeps kids in cages  #EnoughIsEnough  #EnemyOfThePeople   Vote #Biden2020Landslide 🇺🇸  #AmericaWakeUp
We should just stop testing all of the idiots that the Idiot in Chief wants to meet with, or make them wait in line at a testing center and then have to wait weeks for the results like the rest of America. They can tell tRump after the fact if the results are positive.
They bow to their masters...the deepstate. Just like the deepstate shut down the whole world over a hoax sars virus...the deepstate has way more power than you know! 55million(before Trump) a day is over 20billion a year all for cgi images. We need to defund all space hoaxers!
Taken out of context in the article which says “Biden attempted to explain that point by arguing that Latinos in Florida and Arizona had different views on immigration.” And that’s completely true. Same way East Coast and West Coast have turnpikes vs. freeways so shut up Trump.
This message is not going to help you pull votes from the Trump camp.  Not at all. Please focus your messages on managing this disaster in our country, and providing equality for the masses. These are the topics that resonate with most Americans.

The Trump Campaign is basically Publisher's Clearing House:   Super amateurish video but the emails are hilarious.
I've seen a few of your vids suggesting Trump is desperate, but it's not just him. His campaign is as well. I've been getting nonstop pathetic and desperate emails from the Trump campaign. Absolutely embarrassing:
Calm down. This will most likely lead to the probable fact that Russia was laundering money through the NRA to Trump and the GOP.
Lol nah, they trump supporters 🙏
there's NO PROOF of that no matter how big you write the word. but there are facts that prove that trump is the biggest liar in the history of presidents.
Just like Trump’s trillion-dollar tax cut for the wealthiest individuals and corporations, the #2A isn’t a principle for these bigoted NRA hucksters. It’s their way of bilking folks and stuffing their own pockets.  It’s never about principle—outside of pride and greed.
Well it seems Tucson residents must be very happy to pay Trump's campaign bills. 😷

Trump’s tendencies maybe warrant the comparison like comparing a boxing match to full scale war—they’re both violent fights, but that’s about it.  Implying generally that China and the U.S. at large are similar in degree or kind is gaslighting IMO.
If Trump were running against Jesus, how would he attack him?
It’s old Karl Rove tactic: take the quality of an opponent they are most admired for, and turn it into an attack. Trump just perfected it. Remember scoffing at McCain for getting captured?
I don't know which is more concerning:  Either Trump doesn't understand he's signing an EO that requires insurance companies to do what they are already doing, or that #Trumpsters will believe the BS he's peddling.
BREAKING: Trump signs Executive Order banning COVID-19. Claims, “health and prosperity in our time!”
It’s quite clear what Trump is doing. He signs an EO that does the same thing as the ACA so he can claim it is his EO that provides those benefits.

Argument to discount the findings of the CIA, FBI, NSA, Military Intelligence and Homeland that the Russians were behind the DNC hack, interferes in the 2016 election to help Trump. Trump argued that since these agencies weee wrong about WMD in Iraq they were wrong now. This
What you are doing here is making an argumentum ad hominem. Aristotle, in his work Sophistical Refutations, detailed fallaciousness arguments that are disingenuous. You are arguing that because scientists were wrong in the past they must be wrong now. Trump made this same stupid
Trump only wants to give the appearance of action to keep his base fired up and give the GOP &amp; Fox News talking points to distract from Covid-19 and BLM. He does not care if he actually accomplishes anything except his reelection.
Oh and isn't this the same ACA, Obamacare, the Trump and Bill Barr are trying to have overturned in court right now
True, but other agencies must keep arrest and deportation records. Theoretically one could attempt to match the data. But I guess Trump is just using BS to appease his base.
O &amp; they don’t believe in 🦠&amp; r big trump supporters 🍄🤡💩🤮
You and Trump have Fox and Russia. We the people need to have Fair elections. Oh wait, I forgot you don't care about that at all. You are Putin's puppet.

What she is saying, and many other people believe, is that four more years of Trump and a better Dem candidate in 2024, is less deadly than 4 years of Biden and 8 of Tom Cotton after Trump.  That's what you need to argue against if you disagree.
Even trump knows this isnt a political issue its very wealthy people using the democratic platform to initiate the sequence of the destruction of america along with a covert mission to vaccinate the entire planet once again the united states in not exclusive to this practice.
And a Trump presidency promises a lot more dead Americans.
Why cant people see the trump administration is the last line of defense when it comes to attaining what makes this country great.

Doesn't matter. They're looking for a bump just to get them to November so checks will go out to desperate Americans with Trump's signature on them.
Trump with the help of certain people have already made the connections and as we speak are preparing to make an unprecedented amounts of arrests that is why twitter and facebook have blocked people we are all talking to each other and they dont like it

I hope everyone sees what's going on here. The White House never planned to cut a deal with the Dems.  The idea here is to have Trump issue executive orders and be the hero.  McConnell is in on it. Remember he privately visited the White House alone yesterday.
Pssst...I’m not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the “culprit” (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn’t take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
Could you guys do an ad about the fact that Trump and his cronies are trying to take away Medicare, social security, and Medicaid.
Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
Donald Trump’s Latest Campaign Tactics Are Idiotic And Absurd?? His Desperation Is On Full Display? So Certainly He’ll Try To Cheat Or Steal The Election, However I Really Believe The American People Are Wise To His Antics Now. He Knows The Clock Is Running Out Soon. Very Soon!!!
the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
Yet it is only Putin that Trump is having regular conversations with and refusing to allow accurate readouts of the calls.
Trump denigrates 60% of the country daily - he’s not trying to win over new supporters; just keep the ones he has.  Supporters are slipping through his fingers as he continues pushing people away.  He may set a All-Time Record with Worst Defeat in Presidential History!  MAGA

Putin had nothing to do with trump getting elected its actually been proven. And obama and hillary clinton are under indictments for spying on a presidential campaign. U been in the basement hidin with joe biden?
Right, the "no overtime" policy (note that 20% of all mail delivery is delivered via overtime) and no extra delivery trip policies that Trump mega-donor implemented that is directly responsible for slower delivery times.. is the fault of the workers. 🙄
What is this all about???  “So I have a lot of enemies out there. This may be the last time you’ll see me for a while. A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I’m doing,” said Trump.
I’m as Anti-Trump as I could be - but this is just Foolishness...  You want to act in the same manner as those you criticize? Really?  The term “backfire” comes mind...
Huge concern about Trump's racist history which is all over out there and continues on a daily basis. Huge concern about Trump's failure to lead in a pandemic.

So the Republican argument that the House should have gone to the courts to force Trump to honor subpoenas for documents and witnesses during impeachment wasn't a realistic one.  Schiff was 100% correct.  No chance McGahn testifies because the subpoena expires in January.
Deflection. They aren't the ones deciding to implement policies to purposely slow down the mail.  Trump's partisan mega-donor is doing that.
Bottom line is that Trump was successful in ensuring McGahn won't provide testimony until after the election, and also destroys the argument from Republicans that the House should have gone to the courts to get testimony and documents during impeachment after being blocked.
Trump can't even pronounce the major countries yet as he is still practicing to be president.
Bottom line is that you and Trump are perfectly happy with the rising death rate because they're just numbers and don't mean anything? So you're OK with a city the size of Ft. Lauderdale, FL, or Vancouver, WA, going extinct w/160000 people?  We're not. These are moms, dads, etc.
The longer we live with trump’s incompetent response to the virus, the money we will have to spend.
Major Republican operative and partisan Trump mega-donor who has no experience in mail delivery pinky swears that he won't do what he's already admitted to doing.
🖕🏾Kanye and all of his stupid ideas.  How can trump stand him....when he hates black people?
Whoops forgot to add I do feel strongly about this: #TrumpHoaxedAmerica. Maybe Twitter trying to stop hashtag because it’s in past tense, not present tense as it should be. Trump hoaxing America is more accurate as he has not stopped and never will. There is no past tense
Imagine if ABC's World News Tonight decided to do an entire segment anytime Trump made a gaffe that could be construed as a racist comment.  🤦🏻‍♂️
I care desperately for people to quit allowing neolibs to define the choices for you. It is not Trump or Biden unless you fall for that.

I would just love for him to attend a mask-less church service In Mississippi!
Lapierre is a grifter of nearly trump level thieving.  To think of all those NRA members who thought thier money was going to hate, racism and violence... Instead, he was taking the cash for himself. Bummer, eh?
yeah no, i’m saying compared to the 50 million they stated. 5 million is still a ludicrous amount and indicative of a terrible response by trump and the entire US government, as well as the general populace’s insistence to not wear a mask. it’s fucked up
This is what Trump fans want you to belive but it is revisionist history. Trump fans number one driving motivation in voting for him was his overt racism.  via
To out right election rigging. Similarly GOP issues have always been rooted in racism but before Trump they took efforts to disguise by pushing valid policy aims to advance racism. States rights is really code for Jim Crow laws and circumventing Civil Rights legislation
Ideology, religious issues, gun rights while paying homage to the 1 % donor class. GOP bass don’t understand policy and cast their vote for the most religious on the ballot.  GOP have used voter ID laws, Gerrymandering to prevent the democratic process for years till Trump turned
And Trump's likes saying he's first and best at everything. Let's give him what he deserves.
If you think Trump will be the first, you’re living in Fantasyland. He gets away with everything. He regrets nothing. I gave up hope that I’d get to watch him suffer. Please I beg you to prove me wrong!!!

I love waking up to big breaking news stories about Trump and crew in more trouble, west coast y’all.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? 😅 Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
Isn't her dad George Conway? He acts more like a progressive than a conservative and certainly is no fan of Trump.
And have Trump win?
What the heck are you talking about? Are you a racist? Because that's the only reason people vote for Trump.
Why is he so uniquely special? He’s doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden’s help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say “Trump” in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.

Maybe because after 8 years of you, and 3 years of Trump where you set him up for a slam dunk. We are now the 2nd worst place to raise a family. You killed millions of innocent people and are a war criminal. Young people are educated, that’s part of the problem, we see your BS.

Mayor Pete. This woman is broke, questionable character and has changed her story about a dozen times. She has refused to take a lie detector test and that is because she will fail. All of these woman refuse to take a lie detector test. Virtually all the women that accused Trump
Like you're not wrong, none of you, but at the same time I'm hoping it will be like Bush where really everyone else runs the show and he's like a dumb talking puppet. You know? I mean the alternative is Trump again... so... Like.
'May karma find you all': Woman's obituary for her late husband condemns Trump and people who don't wear masks
Trump lowered the price of insulin and Biden is against #MedicareForAll, so I doubt he’s a one issue voter.
No one is speaking in Milwaukee. They chose to speak from their respective cities because of Covid. He’s not hiding in his basement. That pic that Trump touted is photoshopped.

Well it is in a way. Everyone is out to get him out. Mcarthism with the Red scare and lavander scare lasted three years and four months just about the same amount of time of the Trump Era. Long enough of a nightmare to never be forgotten but short enough not to permanently change

HEY TRUMP...STFU ASSHOLE!!!  NEVADA...👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I’ve yet to see trump maintain composure for more than 8 minutes.  ever. EVER.
I don’t think   should do anything of the sort. Stay out of it and let the Justice Department do its job and bust Trump. I think Trumps biggest weakness in the State of New York. The AG just hates his guts. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
That’s because the Dems have been cheating! The longer this iligeal lockdown lasts, the angrier people are getting at Dems, and in Oregon, Governor Brown and Mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler. President Trump will win in a landslide in November.
President Trump is going to win the 2020 election in a landslide! All the garbage happening in our society, BLM, ANTIFA, is because the Dems are getting desperate. Beware of false flags.
Barbara, I’m sorry for your ignorance. Maybe, you should google all the sex trafficking arrests President Trump has made since being in office. This is what this is about—child sex trafficking! The biggest offenders should be shaking in their boots!

Ya if Trump could do that, let him do it now. It's a stupid bluff. It's like playing poker and saying "I have another card I've been hiding in pocket and if you don't let me win I'll use it"
159,000 dead, 50M unemployed, testing that is completely useless becuz it takes so many days to get results back, hospitals still without PPE 6 months into a pandemic, bounties on the heads of our soldiers and Trump tweets all day. He wants to get rid of Medicare and SS as well.
Trump
I have no proof, but that does not matter to the GOP, but it seems more likely to me that any voter fraud in 2016 occured in favor of Trump. That would explain the incorrect polls better in swing states than "silent supporters".
Or if Trump delivers single payer healthcare on a whim.

Arguably true. It certainly leans more conservative than some other polls.  Even if it's an outlier, a poll that shows Trump head is something Dems might want to look at, even if only to better ramp of GOTV. Yes?  I think they want to get donations off four more years of Trump.

Ok. Trump has 25 allegations by women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has been recorded on Howard Stern and in other interviews making these misogynistic statements and those that sexualize his own daughter. You have videos of Biden hugging girls and kissing their heads.
Bring the economy to a standstill, blame Trump.
Just so we’re clear, you take no issue with this. Ok.
How does this answer my questions? Again, would you support prosecution in Trump or Dersh were accused?
90 days to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho  * #trump Tripled white unemployment. #100ReasonsToVoteForJoe
So I’m to assume by the lack of response by both of you that you would not support prosecution for Trump or Dershowitz if evidence supported it. Perhaps you need to reexamine your own issues.
Sign the petition: Stop Trump’s hiding of COVID-19 data. Sign here:
Trump is a whack job.
And, again, hugging children, even kissing their heads, isn’t a crime. If evidence arises of sexual abuse, then he should be prosecuted. It’s ironic that you don’t object to Trump sexualizing his own daughter, yet you call strangers disgusting for asking for evidence.
And if Clinton was involved, he should go down. Dershowitz and Trump are also listed. Do you feel they should be prosecuted if evidence suffices as well?
Like in Portland where no buildings have been burned down? Someone lives on a diet of Fox and Trump tweets.
Still no evidence of a crime. And, unlike the GOP, if there were an accusation, he’d be largely decried. 25 accusations against Trump and he’s defended constantly. Look at Franken as an example of how this gets handled by Democrats.
Sally Yates making the clarification to Ted Cruz that the FISA warrant was placed on Carter Page as he was a FORMER member of the Trump campaign.  We’ve all known this but it’s great to hear her tell them directly that the Trump Campaign was not being spied on.
Sally Yates is lying? Trump lies every day? Democrats all lie? Republicans are not corrupt? Ya'll must really like living in a third-world autocracy cuz that's where we are today.
Instead, you will get "of course it was a BUG if it actually favored Trump! Anything that isn't actively persecuting MAGA must be a system failure!"
Trump said he may deliver convention speech from White House
Trump supporters, are you watching Lindsay question Sally????
I agree.  Trump will b so far into the mud everyone loses.  Hillary was a better debater by far in 2016.......but Trump got ove with all of his childish, ignorant “outsider” behavior and that worked with less educated whites and frustrated Obama voters.  Stay above it 0 debates.
Nah.  He opens himself up to having his knees kicked in by trump and his campaign thugs.  He doesn’t need it as long as trump keeps hurting himself.  I don’t think he picks up extra working class or suburban White female voters in a debate...his Presidential broadcasts r winnin!
I know some of her constituents. They really wish she would at least be honest and join the Republican Party.   She does a good job for real estate investors, who are big donors to her.  What does President Trump do again?

The longer we live with trump’s incompetent response to the virus, the money we will have to spend.
This is the problem, he is quite possibly more dangerous in many ways than Donald Trump. But because he isn’t the president, people don’t treat him as much of a threat.

Literally any mistake Trump makes, no matter how petty or stupid, is passed off as genius now.

Donald Trump &amp; family &amp; friends are the biggest group of grifters this country has ever had. If you are an NRA member you should be outraged by what leadership has been doing with your money. Trump is doing the same thing. He can't ever have a charity again. That is swampy.
Like the NRA trump is using the federal govt as his own private piggy bank. That is the true definition of the swamp. Under tRump it's never been swampier. Americans should be outraged by this while driving over crumbling bridges &amp; landing at old airports. It is our money!

Ha Ha there is no way trump is losing.  There are Sooooooo many unseen and unheard supporters it would make your head spin!  Watch and see  Trump 2020
They actually didn’t choose it. Hilary Clinton won the popular vote in the country, because we have a corrupt system where the president is elected by the elites (Electoral College) we have Donald Trump.

Then Trump can invite Kanye and Joe to the Whitehouse to do a joint interview with Brett Baier.

He has a knee-jerk reaction against the following:  - people that tout crappy models - irresponsible uses of polling - overfitting of data - Trump himself (not polls about him)  He doesn’t like Trump but he doesn’t think good polls for him should be shunned.
I still don’t know why Trump felt the need to run for President if this was his life beforehand.
Until they figure out who/what they are in a post Trump landscape it sure as hell does
If you Google "images of Joe Biden praying" you'll see many different images of a man humbling himself before God - lost in deep in prayer.  See what you get if you Google the same thing for Trump.
I don't see it as a problem.  30 states wanted to be represented by Trump.  30 is greater than 20. 2,626 counties wanted to be represented by Trump vs. 487 by Clinton. Even in the EC, states like NY and California still wield a lot of power.  I don't mind it at all.

Find me 50 black voters that were going to vote Biden and will now switch to Kanye.  Either they weren’t going to vote or are Trump voters...

If anything happens to Dr. Fauci or his family, trump, his administration and many of the repugs will have blood on their hands.
Oh, we need a lot more polling data to do proper analysis.  I just think it’s folly to assume Kanye pulls from Biden.  The two are in opposite universes unless “black” is your only criterion.  He’s much more like Trump than Biden, so his appeal should be similar.

Trump is not a doctor.  Even if he was, it is not his place as POTUS to offer medical advice or opinions OF ANY KIND.

Great news! Since Trump has nothing to hide you should be thrilled to know that Deutsche Bank has turned over all subpoena records. So finally DA Vance will have the records to clear trump of all allegations!! Aren't you all so excited? I know I am. 😃

Trump is a Fake President
Initial polls with West in them had him pulling from *Trump* like 1-2 pts (and polling at like 1%).  The guy wears a #MAGA hat and is legit crazy.  I have a hard time seeing how he pulls anything but a handful of disaffected voters - ones that vote for Mickey Mouse otherwise.
I really hope ⁦ can help to solve this systemic problem.  Trump Agents May Leave Portland, But Police Brutality Won’t.
What completely insane stupid shit did tRump do today? I guess I shouldn't swear but I am really tired of him.
Because the Trump administration has shown themselves to be truthful - about anything. 😂
The worst thing I can say about trump is thet he doesn’t care about US.
Yeah, this won’t work.  Kanye is both nuts AND wears a #maga hat.  On top of that, polls I saw a month back had him pulling support from Trump, not Biden.

Yup. But, tRump can’t escape State Courts
Best way to beat tRump is to highlight the people he has hurt by his policies. Looks like even Missouri is voting to expand the ACA medicaid. The ACA looks really good now even in red states. I remember when team Fox called Obama a dictator for trying to give people health care.
Republicans have been pushing mail voting for decades.  It was one of Karl Rove’s main tactics.  Trump trashing this was an own goal.

He may get DOZENS.  And what makes you think he’ll pull from Biden?  The few polls I saw with West on them had him pulling from Trump.  The guy wears a #mags hat, man.

Sending in trump’s goons made things worse and ramped up the mayhem and violence. Tell the whole/true story, no just your subjectivity-coated, narrative fulfilling version.

Yep, and what was slimy Nancy and Chucky doing? Nothing, except trying to impeach Trump for 3 years! Nancy was dancing in China town trying to prove Trumps closing of the borders was racist.
Wait, what?  The feds left Portland and then the protests died down.  I live here.  The Oregon State Police took over patrols and calmed things down.  The protests are still happening but at a much calmer pace.  Nothing big happened in PDX.  If Trump takes this as a win...LOL.
Honestly, I expect Trump to refuse to debate and then say the election wasn’t “fair” because of it

Probably reverse psychology. If Trump says he's for one thing, everybody does the opposite. Also, it's requesting absentee ballots--not overall vote by mail.
Finally a plausible explanation for Trump
Saying “Trump Wins Portland” because things calmed down after the federal troops left is like saying the US won the Vietnam war when in reality we just gave up and went home.
Trump just filibustered the whole time.  It was like the other person wasn't even present.

And we want to survive to see tRump removed. We also will return to a normalish way of life but not if tRump gets 2nd term.
Trump is past stupid and into moronic.
Watching the Axios/Swan interview &amp; I still can't believe tRump is POTUS. He is by far the most ignorant person in the world who is a leader of a country. The invisible accordion working overtime. He is a hideous human. Red eyes, can't stay on topic, hugely insecure. Vote Biden.
You mean the testing system Trump delayed cuz he thought Coronavirus would only affect Democrat states &amp; he could kill off some Dems??  *That* testing system???
Trump’s America is a disaster.
The only docs he could possibly have are those put together by the Obama Adm. Trump is just too damn lazy. Hasn't worked a day in his life.
Yay Vance can have Trump's tax returns! Should have before the election. Yay!!!
Trump is doing Trump in
He eviscerated Trump - it was quite something to see
1. I'm very concerned about #coronavirus cuz a majority of those dying belong to my community  2. You realize the rest of the world's laughing at us cuz of Trump  3. We're #1 in the world for most cases &amp; deaths so I've gotta to give it to you, Trump made us #1 in something...
It is.  Everything w/Trump is a conflict of interest.
You misspelled Trump.  Have you seen that Axios interview?  How could any so called "patriot" look at Trump and think  he's got it under control.  That he considers the needs or wants of anyone else but himself?  He has yet to say a single negative thing about Putin
If you want millions of Americans to die from COVID vote for trump.
that Trump Axios interview should be seen by every single American
B. Bonus points if not named Trump.
This makes me sick. All lives matter. Even Trump supporters
Y’all,,, I’m starting to think this trump presidency just ain’t gonna work out!
What a horrific soulless monster. Trump can’t possibly understand a moral, ethical, soulful, kind, and generous man such as John Lewis was!
...and it’s HIS voters that will be underrepresented.  Here’s Oregon.  Guess where the Willamette Valley is (ie: where the people live) and where they don’t (ie: Trump’s base in the state):
I didn’t realize that VP Pence is also intellectually challeged too along with trump.
Did everyone think the Portland protestors were angels? Not at all - the good people there were hounded by wolves like that woman who wanted to spread hate instead of reasonability. She and her friends are reasons why Trump will win!
NY #prosecutors say #Trump investigation extends beyond hush money payments
I'll watch it.  But this might be the battle of the Dementia Brothers if true (I've seen him live on TV and disagree)...cuz Trump is well on his way, my friend.
I missed the Trump presser today, what did I miss? #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
But I want to be awake for when Trump loses.  Hence beer.  If whiskey, I'll pass out before the polls close in Ohio.
You mean win of course. That’s a strong ticket. Get trump to bow out and run it now.
If This Poll Is Accurate, Trump Will Be Reelected Easily
Well there are many elections to come hopefully. It will matter mostly to get rid of trump or there may not be any in the future. I think we have some up &amp; coming Bernies out there. Keep the faith &amp; this time vote Biden 2020. It would have been nice tho. I hear you.
Trump is so dumb. He doesn't say how it would work for TikTok to pay the Treasury if China sells it to Google. Like Google needs to get bugger &amp; since when can a private company be sold at the behest of our gov't? Thought Rs were against gov't intrusion. He's just pissed--Tulsa.
Yup..make him debate Trump. I want to see that!!!!
If Biden isn’t available, Trump should debate Kanye
Yes, make America great by voting Donald Trump out of office in a landslide vote!  It will be enormous!  Biggest loss ever by a Republican!  Great!
Way to spread COVID - don’t see but 1 boat - wow people must hate Trump there!!
So - you slam Nancy Pelosi, saying she went after Dr. Birx, and then you go after Dr. Birx yourself.   You are a disgrace.  How you have handled your entire presidency will go down in infamy.  The biggest loser: Trump.  Russia is an existential threat to the US because of YOU!
And today Trump has called  Anthony Fauci a liar.  What a child!! We saw this coming since day 1 when Fauci spoke at the first Covid Response meeting.  He corrected Trump. You can’t piss off Trump without retribution, so damn the science, go with the gut &amp; kill more Americans.
Ask you how pulling people off the streets and Trump kissing Putin’s butt has anything to do with socialism?
He is going to lose and lose big.  It’s over for Trump.
.   FAKE NEWS: 45th President of the United States is Donald Trump.  Trump did not WIN the presidency. He conned and cheated his way into the White House! After 20,000 lies since 2016 it is clear he is a LOSER!
Omg did trump just invent taxes????
Really.....is that all you got??? TRUMP 2020!!!!
Looking forward to November!! Trump by a landslide!!!
Trump and Kanye should have a debate. Biden can join them if he’s up to it.
Trump 2020!!!!!!!
I wouldn’t get in too the ring with Trump, he will spend the whole time pushing his bullshit.. a
It's sad. Lots of people forgot what our whole primary campaign was about. It was never about just beating Trump at any cost or we would have just joined Biden and not even had a campaign.
This is something for Trump's second term.
Another story about push back against the left-wing mobs.
You do know that it's possible to hate Trump and also not like Biden, right?
You spelled DONALD J TRUMP wrong
When was I ever supposed to put energy towards defeating Trump? I was a Yang supporter turned Congresssional candidate that primaried an establishment incumbent. I'm an activist for UBI. I'm not a Democratic shill. I don't have to put energy to defeating Trump. Not my job.
Everyone likes to forget that Yang actually ran to solve the problems that got Trump elected in the first place. Trump is the symptom and not the disease. We all knew that during the primary but now we're supposed to forget it.
This 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻is how Republicans rationalize Trump.  Thanks  for reminding Americans why we need  in November. #AmericaOrTrump   #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteByMail2020
I just want you to game this out.  To me, it sounds like most people’s take here is:  Trump loses —&gt; [MAGIC] —&gt; Still President!  Given that his signature, if he loses, is worthless by law on 1/20/2021...this would be a coup.  What fits where [MAGIC] is?
If you're wondering how Andrew feels about Trump voters... Well, here you go. How do you think he feels about third party voters or those who sit out or those who don't support Biden? Time to pause and reflect #YangGang.
The only reason Trump wants to ban tiktok is because of his rally in Oklahoma.
Killing children and teachers wasn’t on my Trump bingo card.  Excellent infastructure week we’ve been having.
You misspelled Donald Trump
Trump supporters, today is the day to mail in your $5.00 donations.  The internet is not safe.
Trump can debate Kanye, Biden can show up if he wants to.
Not so much
I remember it, but I was 20 and not paying attention.  I don’t have the ability to compact media bias/influence one era to the other. Without Corona Trump would have had a roaring economy, and rallies... not even a convention.  2020 is very strange
That’s also what my conservative mom said 2 days ago. She said she’ll have to vote for Trump again because of the “killing babies” part. Other than that she’d go for Biden.
Rick Wilson isn't pretending to be anything. He's been clear from Day One that once Trump is out of office, we'll go back to opposite sides.   We're well aware of what he stands for. Just because this is new information for you doesn't mean it is for everyone else.
I’m sure Putin ordered tRump to have hidden mics imbedded. We’ve seen that one before a la US Embassy in Moscow.
Vote it down. Let the Jan 21 President remodel the West wing! TRump will make it look like Hitler’s den and prob have hidden mikes installed per Putin’s request.
As pro-life as 157,000+ dead (and counting), as pro-business as tariffs, as pro-family as kids in cages, as pro-military as Russian bounties, as pro-America as dismantling and discrediting American institutions. This is Trump’s GOP.
Donald trump &amp; Mike Pence are removed from the WH tomorrow.
Someone needs to create a troll video NOW with Biden and Obama fighting Trump with light sabers.  Trump gets two small ones to move w/his hands every time he does that accordion motion he does.

I live in suburbs of Portland. Sorry, really getting tired of this. Nothing is being accomplished other than playing into the hands of Trump and making a total mess of a beautiful city.  The message has been lost.
Peloton, painting walls, building furniture and despising Trump.
The priveledged white country club crowd.  Not exactly the demographic that Trump has been pandering to for the last 4 yrs.  Pay attention rural high school educated people.  In the end, he does not give a s***t about you.  You are just his pawns.
So, Trump is a globalist?
Trump is getting ready to announce the Covid relief issues just like a dictator he’s overriding Congress
If trump and the republicans haven't proven this old adage, nothing ever will: A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on.
Vote by mail through the post office is virtually safe. Trump’s attempt to spoil this is way way an abuse of power and constitutionally illegal. Call your congressman today  We must not give this dictator our power.
If Trump intercedes in the COVID relief bill he will rubber stamp the republicans bill. Millions will lose any chance of getting the money they so desperately need.
Districts of Trump administration
Neither do you. You and other trump supporters are guilty of spreading his lies on Facebook &amp; Twitter.
I’m listening Trump supporters and loser Trump 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤔🤔🤔
Trump you sent federal police in to cause anarchy- tear gassing non violent protestors demanding equality for black lives!
Such Bullshit they are so afraid of losing...they are so stupid
Your daily reminder that Donald Trump is a fucking bitch
Trump can’t string a sentence!!!!  He’s a failed business man like he’s failed America! Trump uses threats and violence to get his way... wonder if we will hear the coccaine snorts again during the Presidential debates!!
So basically you are choosing to ignore everything Trump says and does.
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
Trump Issues Executive Order Banning TikTok, WeChat -
It’s not even 6:00 am here and Trump already misused “their” and “it’s” today and I think I need to just stay in bed and call this day a do-over.
This fiscally responsible GOP has gone off the rail. How can this happen, how is this legal. Is there no oversight committee? And we have to pay for this, while Trump brags the ecconomy is doubt so well. What a fake, sham, what an empty vessel Trump is. Fake!
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
well shit, imagine how trump feels about the hypocrisy he receives.
Does anyone think Trump wants vengeance because of the Tulsa debacle? Attack the apps that helped kids get the tickets?
It’s simple, even for a simpleton. It’s America or Trump. If you can’t figure that out, there’s no help for you.
Trump signs executive order to ban TikTok
I’m not a practicing Catholic, but Joe is. Any Catholic voting for Trump after this statement should examine their conscience.
I’m sorry, but what party allowed Trump to happen and keeps empowering him to do terrible things? What party chose not to remove him when he was impeached?  What does it even mean to be a Republican anymore? Is it just a team jersey?
The only thing positive about Trump’s presidency is everyone’s Covid tests
I’m pretty sure “Thighland” is Trump’s chain of low-cost “massage” parlors.
Payroll taxes fund social security don’t let Trump screw up your benefits. You will need it and many many already do even Trumpers.

Thank you Twitter!!! You have a moral obligation to block the dangerous lies! #Twitter has barred the Trump campaign's account from tweeting until it removes a video of Trump on Fox News claiming children are "almost immune" from COVID-19.  # via
Joe Biden doesn’t treat women as sexual objects for one!! Trump has had everything given to him, threatens people for other things, lied and cheated and he’s failed at all businesses he’s own. It’s taken executives at banks and others who invested with him to bail him out!!
Everything’s Trump touches turns into a dumpster fire.  #TimesUp #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Trump’s lack of leadership to the COVID pandemic in the U.S. has made us the laughing stock in the rest of the world - not to mention the most dangerous. Every horrible policy he’s enacted pales in comparison to this crisis he’s caused. postcard scripts:
My main concern is, how does one "debate" with Trump? You know he is going to lie, throw out false equivalencies, and ramble. What's the point of "debating" an amoral, narcissistic, pathological liar? It's a nightmare.
Folks, this isn't a partisan issue, the #FakeNewsMedia brainwashes YOU, the 🇺🇸people, into believing their anti-Trump narrative. Re-elect  to put a STOP🛑to this lie and forever eliminate the #ChinaVirus, aka the #WuhanVirus, or my favorite, the #KungFluVirus🇨🇳👲🏽.

Proper funding for the USPS is necessary for many reasons. Trump must stop his refusal. Trump is mastering voter suppression. Everyone needs to contact their elected officials.
Trump must be stopped giving his acceptance speech at the White House. He must be stopped mixing his politics with his duty to protect the credibility of the elections and his primary job as president for all Americans.
The only thing positive about Trump’s Presidency is everybody’s Covid tests.
the problem here is that if trump sees this he is actually going to use it as a thing
Not overlooking anything with Biden- Trump’s mentally unwell and unstable to be leading along with being a sexist misogynist, racist, xenophobe, homophobe who is using his position for his own family’s position and wealth. trump befriends all fascists. DISGUSTING you’d vote Trump
Lol. Come on Jon, the only thing “goofy” is reporters lying for YEARS about Trump, with no accountability or apology.
Love the Native American culture, seems most hate Trump and conservatives.
This is interesting using tweet to do police business.. can you send person, tell them in person.  stop tweet.  You people look trump.

Lawyer For Epstein Victim Says Trump Was “Only” High Powered Person Who Helped Him
Lawyer For Epstein Victim Says Trump Was “Only” High Powered Person Who Helped Him
Trump prematurely pushed for opening the country. More people died because of the Trump virus. Now he is pushing for kids to go to school, prematurely again.  How many more need to die before congress will tell Trump, it is enough? There is no plan, no healthcare an. He failed!
She’s right. Only trump could produce this response.
He starts blaming portland police for not being able to stop protesters from “beating up federal buildings”. JS tries to ask a Q, Trump stops him with “You are trying to blame law enforcement...”  Dude you were *just* doing that!!!

Trump driving this to thwart vote by mail
History judges us by our words and deeds. Trump is self-centered, selfish, and envious.  I have to wonder if Pres. Bush's attendance infuriated Trump. Rep. Lewis also boycotted Pres. Bush's inaguration in 2001, also an election where winner was by electoral but not popular vote.
A BLM sign is not, or should not be, a political party sign as a trump sign would be.
Trump learning his multiplication tables as a child.  Teacher: 3 x 3 = 9 Trump: You don't know that ... you don't know that.
I can’t wait to figure out what Putin has on Trump. Whatever it is, it has to be huge considering how unwilling the Trump administration is to condemn the Russians for anything at all.   Imagine being able to pay to kill US soldiers  freely because your blackmailing the president
I think you should know that it reads more like a memoir of painful family dynamics.  Donald Trump's father was a twisted, sick character.   It sheds light on Donalds way of moving through the world.  I came away with a profound sense of sadness for this dysfunctional family.

Everybody knows t Trump pushed to open the country up. Prematurely. What has that gotten us, more Trump virus? Trump failed, &amp; thousands have died. Now Trump demands to open up schools,&amp;  is pushing for our kids to return to school, prematurely, &amp; 10000s will die. Dont trust him!
Trump attacks mail in voting because he knows he will lose. He can’t executive privilege out of this. Can’t sue states for expanding access and use of this constitutional right. He could care less about it. He is dictator in the making. Republicans stop him.
When Trump gets convicted, I want the GOP reverse all of Trump's deregulations, executive decision, and pardons reversed.  And I want all Repubs to get sanctioned and removed, that went along with Trump's lies.
What Trump is asking for is totally different. Not comparable at all.
Walk away,
Donald Trump will do anything to win.
Baron Trumps son’s school will remain closed until at least October.  The child will have to remain in quarantine at his home safely with his mother.  Trump would be hard pressed to send him anyway. He must face the virus head on. He lies to the American public treasonous.
You would have better odds of trump admitting he was wrong on something. 😂😂😂
i pray to God Trump is re-elected and you get thrown out of Congress
Right. This issue turned partisan only because of Trump. If flawless mail in voting is the hill democrats are willing to die on it just may come back to bite them should Trump pull off a win.

President Trump and his Company Investigated for Possible Fraud, Filing Suggests - The New York Times
Was looking forward to reading Trump’s new health plan due out yesterday, but I can’t seem to find it! Perhaps, he left it with his caddie Lindsey #TrumpHasNoPlan
So trump's mega donor appointee to run the postal service is gutting it, and then trump predicts problems with mail in voting - he's downright prescient!  And corrupt, don't forget corrupt.
If Trump loses he’s laid the groundwork for doubt about the results. If he wins, Democrats can’t contest because they have been so adament that  mail-in voting is perfect. Win win!
its been going on for 60+ days now. when trump came to office we had protesters out for trump be out of office but that only lasted for 2 weeks then that was that.
If it is not safe for criminals to stay in prison, how can it be safe for our kids to go to school? Trump pushed to open the country, see the result, he is responsible that so many have died. This is an American catastrophy of epic proportions. Don't let him do that to our kids!
Trump has planted the seed, his base believes the election is rigged. If not elected, Trump will call foul play, rile up his base, &amp; that will not be a peaceful demonstration. They are armed w/ assault weapons. If elected he will claim political capital,&amp; we have seen nothing yet

The children's camp gives us a climps as to what to expect when our kids go back to school. They get Covit, give to their parent, grand parents,&amp; friends, neighbors. Trump cancelled his convention, allowed felons to get out of jail, but our kids must go to school. Who cares
Noticed how this chicken shit walks away from the men but when the woman tries to stop him he hits her!! Typical for men like this, attack women/children or men who are smaller, just a bully. And don’t forget yelling about sodomizing/rape! Thanks Trump, emboldening these ppl.
And ya know it’s really fake bc they’re holding hands. The real Melania does not touch trump!!
Way to spread a false narrative.   Note shocking if you’re supporting Trump.
You think Trump killed Mac??? What an idiot. Shut up and log off lol.
Funny.   I don’t ever remember feeling anywhere near the depression or financial stress under Obama that I feel right now under Trump.
No you are not. I have never like trump and never watched his show.
But ... Trump was the chaos candidate in 2016.
Trying to take Trump down
Ever hear about vetting? That’s why #trump and his band of incompetences always have, “acting” ppl in charge. He always announces who he wants before they completely check their backgrounds.  VP Biden knows what’s at stake for this presidency.
Not going to happen, ever. You don't get to play the game unless you ante up and are dealt in. Trump and Durham are both in. But maybe I'll be wrong, stranger things have happened.
I like how virtually everyone who attends these #PortlandProtests wears a face covering. Yes,  protesting outdoors is safer than attending a church service or Trump rally. ✌️😷✊
Also they’re afraid that they will lose their cushy jobs by alienating their voting base, who think that tRump is the Second Coming. Spineless, gutless cowards, the lot of them.
Very true. Their strategy, straight from the Trump playbook, was to instill chaos. Part of that is looking intimidating and unfamiliar. That is was countered by a strong show of community support and togetherness makes total sense.
This is trump manipulation because he knows he’s a loser through and through. Leave the postal service alone.
Agreed that Trump isn’t some anomaly. Republicans courted these voters for years.
No matter what, trump will be gone on January 20, 2021. If it's not President Joe Biden it would automatically become madame President Nancy Pelosi!  YEAH!
Most of them are too exhausted to pass anything because it’s a lot of work to carry Trump’s water.
I know what "we the people want" -- trump in prison!  LOCK HIM UP!
I would note that virtually everybody is wearing a face covering. So, yeah, #PortlandProtests are safer than church services or Trump rallies.
They say that Hitler would rather have destroyed Paris than see the city retaken by the Allied forces. I’m waiting for Trump’s “Is Paris Burning?” moment.
Trump doesn’t realize he’s emboldening Dems to vote by mail and  scaring his Repub seniors into risking long lines and COVID-19 to vote in person.  How many takers will he have.
I am well overdone with  bullshit lies as I see the COVID-19 daily death count in America above a thousand. Absolutely irresponsible and reckless. Dr. Fauci has my full faith, trust, and support. Trump needs to be fired.

President Trump is going to win 🇺🇸Re-election🇺🇸
We are in serious trouble. The prediction that by the end of the month another 20K are going to die. Trump has turned this into a political issue&amp; his stubbornness is the main cause. Trump pushed for opening, he looked down on masks, &amp; said it was a hoax.
This is not how American capitalism works. Transparency and fairness is our hallmark. This whole transaction looks like a penny stock pump-and-dump scam.
Now there’s a ban I can actually get behind! What? I think Tik Tok is annoying! “President Trump says he plans to ban TikTok from the US”
Trump supporters are now receiving mass mailings from Melania....  yeah, you know what Donnie?  We don’t like either of you. Save the paper.  Stop wasting our time.
They’re not out in riot gear, but they haven’t left Portland. They’re waiting in the wings in case they decide they want to attack us again. Will probably have nothing to do w/protesters &amp; everything to do w/Trump’s news cycle

It’s only draining because I’m speaking facts lmao, literally straight out of your bible too lol, trump supporters are so brainwashed i feel so bad for yall😔the only thing you fight against is anyone who goes against your fascist, white suburban, racist agenda🤢it really shows

You got it wrong!!!  150,00 Deaths from the trump pandemic proves it. Does Putin still curl your toe hairs when he calls you to give you the Orders?  About those payments to keep your mouth shut when asked if you agree with his (Putin's) Murder Bounties on American Soldiers?
It’s just another day of how I can make it about me to Trump.
Like Trump,  has not admitted defeat and will not turnover power after a free and democratic election. This is dictatorship.
he only says he’s Christian so he can keep his white Christian followers...if you don’t agree with that statement then you’re obviously putting trump before your god🤨 please reread your bible and educate yourself
here’s what I mean, the Bible says “Do you have daughters? Be concerned for their chastity, and do not show yourself too indulgent with them.",  during a 2006 interview with The Rolling Stones, trump said, “I’ve said if Ivanka weren’t my daughter, perhaps I’d be dating her.”
the picture was literally a quote from the PRESIDENT talking about how nothing is more powerful than god🤨if trump suddenly said he doesn’t believe in god anymore I guaranteed half y’all would say that too lol, trump is not a true Christian, reread the Bible you fraudMarquita Bradshaw WINS In HUGE Democratic Primary in Tennessee  via  A former Romney Republican who is now a Trump Republican is her opponent?

Trump got mad at Tik Tok so he’s banning it but allowing Microsoft to purchase it if he gets a personal pay out. Totally not abuse of power or anything 😒

Hey #MoscowMitch #MoscowMitchMcTreason in light of the OBVIOUS and continued threat to our election (new. Riefing) now would be a good time to pass the houses election security bill. You wouldn’t want China &amp; Iran to hurt Trump, would you?
Kanye’s bipolar illness or his celebrity is nothing next to his COMPLETE LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS to run the United States! Haven’t we learned that lesson yet! Donald Trump had no qualification to be president of the United States and look at the mess we are in because of that!

Hello from across the pond! That’s Donald J tRump, soon-to-be ex-President of the United States!
We live in hope! I’ve been thinking about this for almost Trump’s entire Administration. Of course this is why he is panicking about becoming John Q. Citizen! He made himself available to scrutiny that will not go away when he becomes the Former President.
Ok, Fuck Donald Trump. There is already an aluminum shortage because of Covid &amp; Coke is only canning their most popular. My caffeine free diet didnt make the cut. I’m addicted, this is reason 7,000,853,925 to vote him out.
NOT now then when? NOT trump thwn who? Wake Up. American's are.
Of course they HATE TRUMP. He's NOT in their pocket like joe, Obama, and Clinton's. TRUMP is fighting for American's. TRUMP is a American Hero. Draining the Swamp may cost him Everything. We must Stand up for him as he has 4 us.
100% TRUTH. Im out to. No TRUMP, NO TSchneider
This is gonna piss me off, I just know it.
I really hope they don't shaft Biden if Trump loses. He literally gave up his last couple of years of functionality. I disagree with his belief that it was necessary to save the republic, but that sacrifice should be recognized regardless.
Last night I asked my dad if Trump could do ANYTHING that would disturb him enough to stop supporting the maniac &amp; his answer was, “no, not if that means a vote for Biden.”  Guys, that’s fucking horrifying. Fear tactics work. Trump supporters will stand by him “no matter what...”
And a bunch of Trump supporters BEGGING for help.
What comes out of Biden's mouth and what comes at a trump's mouth, Are not even comparable Anyone's allowed to make a mistake long as they corrected trump never does his mistakes are intentional
They are correct. Trump is a danger to any progress in defeating racism. Also Black voters are smart enough to not vote for Kanye West or any other third party candidate.
under your definition of forgiveness even king David would be in hell. Trump may have cheated on wives but has publicly since became president asked for forgiveness. Good for me.
The trump administration just shredded it!!  The only thing it's good for is a** wipe!!!!
Antifa doesn’t care who is in power! They want destruction! They want the end of the US. If Biden wins it won’t stop them they will be empowered! And he won’t do anything to stop them! Our only chance is a Trump win &amp; hopefully control of the senate &amp; congress!
When we elected Clinton, been a slow roll to hell until now! For some reason, maybe it’s Trump putting a wrench in the plans, but the speed of this has now gone off the charts in 2020!
Trump's doing what he can to protect citizens data from the PRC. But who's going to protect us from Microsoft, Google, FB, Twitter? Not to mention VISA/MC and dozens of other corporations abusing our data?
I disagree. I think it will be simple, as they study the history of the GOP, to see Trump - and all of his amoral, corrupt behavior - as part of a natural progression. He IS the Republican Party.
You know that in all of the Omen movies, the Anti Christ came out of the Catholic Church, and there has to be money exchanging hands between Trump Admin and the Catholic Church. Also, and seriously I’m not dissin on the CC, but how come ya’ll always need a freakin exorcist?
The Trump campaign should be asking folks to hold their ballots until after the debates and physically deliver them themselves to the ballot box. Or push for drive-through voting. Like they do drive-through
The Clinton foundation has been investigated as has the tRUMP foundation.  The tRUMP foundation was shut down because of all of it’s corruption

Eric Trump: Joe Biden doesn't have the mental capacity to be president
One day back in 1947 Trump was playing alone, when a strong wind knocked him to the ground and gave him cancer. Ever the germaphobe, he raced to the sink to wash his hands and there was no water pressure. 😳😡  "Covfefe!" Screamed young Donald.
If this is true they should all be fired. The American people chose Trump to be Commander in Chief. The advisers ONLY job is to give him all the options so he can make a decision. Period. This is usurping Constitutional powers vested by We The People.
Trump is not a king nor is he the supreme being almighty. He is a very sick individual who makes horrible threats against people.  He breaks the law &amp; exceeds his authority. He promotes violence and hate with lies &amp; threats.  Twitter &amp; FB were absolutely correct to censor him.
I am very troubled by your statements including asking the African American reporter if he should be asked to take a drug test when he asked you if you would take a cognitive test. We expect such statements by Trump so should we now expect them from you? Unacceptable!!

If Wheeler had taken control in 2016, when riots over Trump getting elected erupted, and then then subsequent riots leading up to today, the city would not be in the mess it is in now.
But what’s really bad is to have a malignant sadistic narcissist and pathological liar named Trump to be President.
Hahah that must be why Trump touts Wall Street Dow/NASDAQ gains while ppl are hungry, homeless and dying?
This is bullshit.
“Requires” is perhaps not the most accurate term for what occurred.  Unlike Trump who never “cleans up” his racist and misogynistic remarks; he chose to clarify and made sure if anyone was offended they understood what his position is. Simple isn’t it?
Michelle Obama is depressed because Donald Trump is a psychopath. Me too. She should be depressed that her husband was worse.

Extremely disheartening that at his rally he said he was done with Trump and was running because he was frustrated with how things were to completely turn around and essentially do Trumps bidding. Never thought Kanye would go against his own individuality and independence
How’s that anti-conservative bias looking now?  Facebook helped Trump get elected in 2016 and they probably will help again.
The postmaster, who Trump put in charge, is slowing mail so republicans can put out the conspiracy theory that it’s being done against Trump.  QAnon does this so well. They create conspiracies from policies their own party creates to try and diminish democratic support

Yeah Trump says Biden will destroy God. We can't have that.
Yep. Crazies like tRump say lots of crazy shit. 🙃
I beg to differ. 😂 For a great many Americans, Never tRump does, in fact, mean Never Republican. I for one despise tRump; I also guarantee you I will never again in this lifetime vote for a Republican.
Facebook &amp; Twitter don't allow the unrestrained spewing of dangerous lies. When users join the platforms, they become subject to rules. Yes, even that idiot tRump! So ... follow me here ... when tRump spews lies,  violating the rules, Facebook &amp; Twitter rightfully silence him.
Yah protect lobbyists especially if they’re corrupt. Corruption and Trump like iron to a magnet.
You stand with trump so stop your yapping
Meanwhile we just let tRump speak and 🤯 🔊 fox might be right this time👇🏼🤣🤣✌🏼
That bible is being held upside down deliberately by Trump.  It's easily seen in the video of this photo ap.  Why?  Is there symbolism in holding a bible upside down?
Your report on Trump’s lies regarding voter fraud was excellent. Thank you.
Trump is laying out a lot of BS.  He’s had almost four years and not accomplished jacks***.  His daily lies, spin, fear mongering is not my idea of winning.  Plus, I’m just sick of his daily whining and name calling like a schoolyard bully.
Any story about Trump and Facebook that doesn't mention that one is paying the other MILLIONS PER WEEK is journalistic malpractice.
Let's all remember that Trump and the GOP are handing millions per week over to Facebook.
Least of his faults, he has no social graces. He doesn’t even understand when a joke is appropriate and when joking is NOT appropriate. In fact, Trump and appropriate don’t ever belong in same sentence.
Any person, group, or company that aids and abets Trump is complicit. Facebook already is.
Some things are hard to predict. The fact that Trump will do crimes to stay in power is not one of them. He has already done illegal and unethical things to stay in power. He will continue to do so, and the criminality will escalate.
"A senior engineer collected internal evidence that showed Facebook was giving preferential treatment to prominent conservative accounts to help them remove fact-checks from their content. The company removed his post. On Wednesday the engineer was fired."
Don’t be this white woman. Just don’t. You vote for Joe Biden, or you own every piece of trump. Very few things are black and white. This? This is absolutely one of them. You have the ability to prove you’re not a fascist and all it takes is voting for Biden. At all costs.
Has there ever been a safer bet than "Trump will dispute the 2020 election results?" He disputed them in 2020 when he WON. When asked if he'll dispute them, he says "we'll see." He has been gaming the system since he was a child and this is just more game.
When, not if. WHEN.
Trump Considering Replacing Pence with Confederate Statue  via  YAY, Despicable's finally starting to empty the Swamp!🥰
Trump is for America first and a wise business man!
Prettt amazing to just make shit up and have over 30 million people blindly follow whatever you say. Cult leaders are going to start following Trump to see how he does it so well
I would bring a tent and camp out for 8 days to vote Trump out.
It will work too. There is a part of our population who takes everything at face value, doesn’t look into anything. Well they do when it confirms their biases and ignores it if it goes against them. Not just a Trump voter issue, something many Americans across the spectrum do
This is why Trump will never release his tax returns. Also the same reason he will do whatever he can to win this election. He potentially faces criminal charges if he is voted out and forced to release his tax returns to investigators
On the other hand a lot of NRA lifers are disgusted by the grifting and of course it will be tied to Trump and his campaign. It won’t affect the cult members, but it’s not going to help Trump.
And, as always, social media sites have NO legal or ethical responsibility to host dangerous lies for ANY reason. The "newsworthy" loophole exists entirely to keep Trump and the GOP from crying crocodile tears.
So Trump is allowed to post dangerous Covid lies (because "newsworthy"), but those who retweet them to correct them are getting busted for violating the rules. But they're using Twitter exactly how it was designed. The problem is Twitter's failure to enforce its rules with Trump.
When Trump and the GOP talk about eliminating red tape, deregulation, and starving oversight organizations, I want you to think of what just happened in Lebanon, because this is where we're headed.
She is for ANTIFA! That's why she will not say anything bad about them. This is her &amp; the Dems parties plan to disrupt America! They'd rather destroy America than to see it Succeed while Trump is in office! There hatred for President Trump is more than their luv of the  U. S.
We already had that experiment long running until Trump recognized the insanity and changed it. Now we have their attention.
Just so you know, I still size people up by running through the totally/Laime menu.  Subbing matte finish on cars for Donald Trump.
Joe Biden is a flat out racist. If Trump had said what Biden has said in recent days, lefty media would have completely melted down. But with Biden, not a peep.
Until the Trump administration, I had no idea how important the state-level Attorney General position was. They have tremendous power, and the leftist ones have been banding together as another weapon against Trump.
Why is the media not asking trump about the bounties put on American troops quit falling for the clickbait do your job

Was Trump a National Merit Scholar? I was a National Merit Semi-Finalist. Does that mean I’m smarter than the guy Trump paid to take his PSAT?
So interesting. Was Trump a Rhodes scholar like Clinton? Did he graduate from an Ivy League institution like Bush? Does he hold a masters degree in anything? What were his SAT/ACT scores? Mensa application? ANY evidence other than sycophantic trolls? NOPE!
NY AG "Major National Announcement" seems likely to be about one of 3 things:  - Suing WH for census manipulation - Wrongdoing by the NRA, charges to be filed  or, the big one: - Indictment of Trump on tax/bank fraud, money laundering  Major National Announcement.  😁🍿

Gee, and tRump* just called Donnie Jr. an 'environmentalist'.  How did Obama destroy the environment? His environmental regulations helped to protect citizens. tRump*, however, is rolling back all of those regulations.

Too little, too late.  Too many ppl are now up-in-arms abt their "rights" to go mask free.  They want to fight about it.  They will eventually die-off which will significantly decrease Trump's voter base.
Who has increased the debt more... Bill Clinton, Obama, or Trump? Ding ding ding! Trump did, long before Covid19 by giving corporate&amp;wealthy tax breaks. His Trade “deals” didn’t help either. Shut up w/ the propaganda. GOP NOT fiscal conservatives or Christian compassionate.
Biden should say his taxes are under audit but provide them anyway and with 10 prior years worth of returns. No trump returns, no debate

At this point in 2016, Hillary had just named Kaine as her running mate, and accepted the nomination at the convention. Then, on August 17th, Trump brought on Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon to run the rest of the campaign. What a difference in 2020...
Trump does not care if kids can get sick and spread the virus.  He just wants the economy moving regardless of the carnage, young or old.
No, as in coup d'etat because Trump is a fucking traitor.
Enough, either President Trump declares “Marshal Law” in what’s become a sinkhole or the people will deal with it themselves!!! We’re sick of it!!!
Delays are all part of Trump's plan to put the fix in.  He is orchestrating a coupe.

Sure. My friend was asking me what the pt of bot is and how to spot a bot! If you look at Eric Trump et al. Their accounts are so full of them! Makes them look popular and helps spread their ahem...messages (lies).
You got it backwards. The Trump Campaign of treasonous spies GOT caught.
I hope Kanye recognizes that the racism he is trying to fight also comes from the GOP. They unfortunately are trying to take advantage of him as well. If it came out he was taking “the white vote” from Trump they’d stop him immediately.  you are nobody’s pawn
No, trump* just continually throws out outrageous dog whistles to distract what a colossal failure he is. GDP drops 33% and it's barely noticed because delay the election. Delay the election should have lasted 10 minutes. trump* has zero authority to delay the election.
It's all an effort to normalize Trump. With Kanye on the ballot, Trump is no longer the most F'n out of his mind candidate.
You sound like another one of those honor student from Trump University. Over 160,000 Americans dead on your old mans watch and all you Trump's worry about is the NASDAQ.
That “maybe even has more power” line is gonna enrage trump. You guys have psychologists on staff??
I hope the criminal you're supporting in the White House is next. You guys will never give up, will you? Stop defending tRump*. He's finished.
We certainly hope that nevertrumpers    don’t tell their followers the number on the card to send for a replacement. That would help the Post Office and hurt Trump.
Biden would embarrass Trump because he has solid plans. Trump’s credibility is shot, nobody is gonna buy all the greatest things ever that he will claim.

Meanwhile in WA 3481 people voted for a candidate named “Goodspaceguy” for governor. He claims to be from the “Trump Republican Party” and destroying all hydro-electric dams in WA is the most sane thing in his candidate statement.
Trump is truly unaware how Russia ridicules him behind his back. Putin couldn’t ask for a better mark or stooge to manipulate. Trump is transactional to a fault and Putin plays him like a second rate fiddle. He’s got trump hook, line and sinker. #weareintrouble

Donald Trump &amp; Jared Kushner have allowed over 160,000 Americans to suffer and die based on a political calculation that withholding Federal aid during a pandemic in order to undermine the credibility of Democratic Governors would bolster Trump's re-election campaign.  Murderers.
Never forget that Donald Trump and Jared Kushner chose to let tens of thousands of Americans suffer and die because they lived in "blue" states.  Make your children know it.
Donald Trump is a mass murderer. Jared Kushner is a mass murderer.
I don't really care if you think that's too harsh. There's over 160,000 people whose opinions don't get to be heard because of the deliberate course of action by the Trump administration since February.  This wasn't just entirely avoidable, it was a political choice.
160,290 deaths and rising every minute.  I think we, as a society, can finally stop pretending like there's any reason to feel guilty about rooting for the death of Donald Trump and everyone else involved in this mass murder.

Fair point, it could easily be the training and the officers following that. I agree it’s a huge issue in America, one that won’t be solved with Trump in office. It’s been an issue for a long time though, police have so much power and lack of accountability
hey blue states just know that if a Beirut blast happens there, Trump and Kushner's first reaction will be to withhold federal aid because you vote for Democrats

Got my letter from him and a copy of the check signed by him, all delivered by the Post Office, framed. Nope! 😉 Thanks, USPS, for delivering pandemic payments on time. Maybe if Trump signs our absentee ballots, they will get to the elections office on time to be counted?
#NextYearBetterHave Trump atoning for all his sins and legal transgressions.
This. This is why I will block you for discussing weight loss (yes, even your own), for joking about "being bad" and eating carbs, for making fun of Trump's weight, for concern trolling about people's "health." It all feeds into the societal bias that kills people like me
Interviewer: “How do you think history will remember John Lewis?"  Trump: “I don't know. I don't know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration."   Me:🤦🏼‍♀️🙄😤🤨😏🤬
“Wherever you’ve had mail-in ballots, there have been widespread cases of voting,” he said. “We’re not going to let that happen.”  Trump Warns That Mail-In Ballots Could Result in Voting  via
You are a total ASS Trump. John Lewis contributed more to America than you ever did. His positive legacy will live on forever n you have no positive legacy. You're time in the White House is almost over. Thank God we will be rid of you!!!
We Must take back the house. TRUMP 2020. If NOT We Are Doomed forever as a FREE People's.You're the media too, Ben.  How do you feel about Trump tweeting that Biden isn't "worthy of the black vote"?  By your logic, if you don't call them out, you are equally as hypocritical.   *Sips out of conservative tears mug*
Vision? What about Trump's (Daddy) reality?! #DonTheCon #DumpTrump #DumpTrump2020 #DumpTrumpDayNov3
This statement is so full of racism and lies, all I can do is LAUGH AT YOU TRUMP #TrumpIsNotWell
Stevie Wonder could've seen that move coming. The fact that Dems would publicly proclaim they were willing to compromise on $1T of assistance to their constituents speaks volumes. Trump shows his constituents that he won't compromise on what they believe, no matter how wrong.
Really? Doesn’t Obama care already cover that? Wow! Are you lost in space trump?
Here's a 'Closer Look' at Trump's latest lunacy #closerlook
Remember when Trump gave us history lessons?
So...  Trump is going to start having cheering sections behind WH reporters during "so-called" press briefings really mini-rallies  The new Bedminster briefing platform is born  How damn pathetic is that?

Anyone want to hand write  they need volunteers. It’s simply a reminder to vote.  i feel good going beyond my comfort zone to remove trump.
As with many people Biden wasn't my first choice for a presidential candidate. Or my second. Or my third. But I'd rather have him and a competent administration rather than this corrupt mob boss regime we have now. Biden has my vote. Trump and the GOP need to be run out of office

Donald Trump’s Cries Of ‘Hoax’ Used Against Him In Stinging New Ad

Kentucky don’t forget about  she is running against bitch mcconnell. He needs to go with trump.
WTF? Kayleigh how come YOU FORGET that DONALD J TRUMP REFUSES TO STAND UP FOR OUR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN! He ALLOWS PUTIN TO PAY BOUNTIES ON THESE SAME SOLDIERS. HOW MANY OF THESE PURPLE HEARTS ARE BECAUSE OF YOU PUTIN LOVING PANSIES??
why you want to embarrass yourself with Trump AGAIN? komm' on kanye!
First Trump's economy wasn't the best ever by far.   Second, he's allowing Wall Street &amp; polluters to do anything they want.  We must build an economy that helps everyone &amp; runs on clean energy.
In a bid to shore up his lagging campaign, President Trump today announced he is adding Nancy Grace as his running mate, a not surprising move after pictures of Mike Pence "frolicking" with several young male aides surfaced in several news stories.
Trump has a plutocratic agenda, despite his populist shtick. Trump has attacked our universities and shared memes showing himself as life-time President, repeatedly. It's time we come together in rebellion, Joe.
I see him hurting Trump more than Biden as only crazy, ignorant people would vote for Kanye or Trump.
Trump has lost his (limited) mental faculties.   A narcissist cannot function when forced into reality.   He's even more dangerous &amp; Republicans are failing humanity.   If you're still supporting today's Republican party you're clearly a selfish fool.
No matter what the format of the first debate trump is a moron. He’s going down in nov
I’d be terrified! But somewhat trust cuomo. Seems like he cares not like trump. I don’t live in NY
More distraction from Trump. Would prefer people talk about Tik Tok then Covid or Russian bounties or secret police or..or..or
Nobody wants freedom, honestly, ......You almost never hear Trump talk about freedom, do you? “Freedom” used to issue from every Republican mouth. No more. Populism doesn’t do freedom, really: It does fairness.
My former dad did that a lot. Beat my mom for what he was doing. So I am very familiar with what Trump is doing.  Sooo.. Trump for prison 2020. And Biden for president 2020.
Won't have to...I live in Oregon. We vote by mail :). But I would wait all day and night to vote out Trump
now we are to BELEIVE that Trump has studied language around the world? I hadn't heard him brag about those accomplishments yet, is that the October surprise?
7 years of Obama travel equals 1 year of Trump protected travel, that we know of. They are still hiding how much he has raked in.
Texas and I believe Mississippi are both sending patients out of state. Federal resources helping out in Texas with flights so Donald Trump KNOWS the situation in TEXAS but LIES about it anyway.
so many senile old white man surrounding TRUMP. Must be a cultural thing, like sexual predators, child molesters and criminals.
maybe, ONCE you separate out the trump republicans from TRUE Republicans.
they poll 100% Trump voters from 2016?
The more Trump tweets, the more I realize Trump isn't the problem in America. The core problem is every elected person who considers themselves a Trump supporter. Any person in charge of policymaking on any level who subscribes to Trump's unconscionably evil BS is the root cause.
trump is pulling out all the stops to fu*k with the election. Already calling voter fraud by vote by mail. Slowing USPS, he’s losing he knows it. Vote early
know that trump will stop at nothing to to fu*k with the election. He has already set the stage for voter fraud. Slowing down USPS, he’s losing he knows it.
The US. The GOP has been at war against multiculturalism and an Inclusive America for decades. They chose Trump to advance their cause of white power, dominance &amp; supremacy. The GOP agenda is to control the courts, the Senate &amp; the economy. Trump is a reflection of the GOP enemy.
Let's be clearer. The Grim Reaper has worked for decades waging political warfare, both overt &amp; covert, against the Democratic Party, progressive issues &amp; multiculturalism ideals. McConnell blocked Obama &amp; allied w/Trump during his candidacy. GOP = ENEMY.
Trump isn't the target. He's symbolic of an unconscionably corrupt political party led by white supremacists with an agenda of complete white domination, power &amp; supremacy. Trump can't go lower. GOP supporters know who he is: their Chosen One. Focus here:
Much as I disagree with most of what comes out of Kanye's pie hole, Trump* is taking advantage of a mentally ill person. Kanye is Bi-polar. The Trump* administration gave him $2M to $5M from the PPP program, probably with strings attached. "I'd like you to do us a favor, though."
True. Avenatti's arrest was less than 24 hours after Trump*s enemies list &amp; Barr's fake summary of Mueller's report came out. The media is aware that Trump* uses Barr &amp; the power of the DOJ to go after his enemies, yet never even explore that possibility in MA's case.
Don’t know if you’ve seen David Rowe’s cartoons before but he’s been slaying Trump for quite a while now and each is a work of art in its own right.

Michael is the only person to lay a glove on Trump. If not for his media strategy the NDA story would have been a brief tabloid headline instead of the push that started the dominoes falling. Cohen, Individual1, EC LLC, Russian money, Nexus to inaugural scandal &amp; Mueller's probe.

Trump's view of Bible contents.. Cause he obviously has no clue... Is a centerfold with this pic...
It speaks very ill of Biden that the only way Trump can even try to differentiate himself from Biden is to lie.
So true but gotta say id welcome Bush back anytime over trump
Deal with the devil is so right.  Trump will do whatever it takes.  He always comes first (except it seems with Putin). BTW, Pence grew up Catholic but later became Protestant (read: evangelical Christian).
trump the Antichrist!
You are sickening trump. You are showing your desperation you’ll say anything to try to win back so many of voters turning to Biden. They see you for what you are. Antichrist
Trump's gross incompetence is exponentially worse than Bush's. At least most of 43's gaffes were kind of funny &amp; mostly harmless.
Trump's audience is not you and me. He's giving sound bites to conservative media that will clean it up and present it an audience of supporters who don't give a damn what he says or does as long as he advances their agenda of white domination, control and supremacy in America.
I don’t want to make assumptions, but seems since Trump was elected this kind of unbelievable abuse has been happening 😳
Q: How will you distribute the vaccine? Trump: "When we have the vaccine, we have the military all lined up." Me (military veteran): That BS sounds like an authoritarian operating in plain sight.
Trump isn't a disappointment to conservatives. He has same bigoted opinions as themselves. Shares in mutual victim hood. Has zero compassion. They have got exactly what they bought and paid for.
Biden was the first Catholic VP in US history.  Catholics make up a quarter of American voters (think Hispanic vote, amongst others). Once again, Trump is all about projection - he's the one without religion and more to the point, without a soul.

Trump is on the list. He's the bulls eye.
When Letitia James was announced as the new Attorney General of New York, I knew Trump and the entire GOP were in a real fight. The first ever in Trump's life that he couldn't cheat his way out of, around, or bully his way through. This is a new decline for white supremacists.
Congress corrects problems every day. (IMHO, both sides keep the other in check) Trump and his ilk were a HUGE setback. We're lucky we only had a Republican House for 2 years. It will take years to correct Trumps destruction. Maybe decades. Lots of changes...
Watched the entire Axios/Swan interview with Trump on Youtube last night. It is hard to imagine a more incriminating piece of evidence for Trump's criminal stupidity and cavalier attitude toward the needless death of so many innocent Americans.
Trump's support doesn't have to be 50%. After nearly 4 years of a daily deluge of delusional and dangerous despotism we're having a conversation over how high Trump's support remains among Republican voters. That alone speaks volumes about the sustained power of white supremacy.
Trump owes $135 million dollars to the American taxpayers for his gold vacations

Don’t let Trump see this. He’ll  retweet as Portland Riot Babies.
Let's be clear. Donald Trump didn't elect himself nor could he protect himself. He symbolizes the legacy agenda of a political party that stood against MLK in 1968 ... and doubled down on that opposition in 2016. 2020 is a reckoning.
What an absolute shame #trump willfully small
What does Faux think?  What does Putin think? That’s when trump will “think”. A prez who doesn’t discern reality is fucking dangerous!
New Low for Trump &amp; GOP  GOP operatives with ties to Trump are actively helping Kanye West get on presidential general election ballots in states to siphon off black votes from Biden  Using a man with a mental disorder (West's bi-polar) is abuse &amp; an act of desperation  SAD

hey, at least no one is asking him about Graham's stupid, Flynn/Trump campaign incriminating hearing today. Score one for Sally!!
I'd be willing to bet Trump* didn't write that tweet. The grammar is correct, he used the word lawful... not in his vocabulary.
You guys hear Trump in Axios interview say "Epstein was murdered or committed suicide, I don't know"?   He admitted on camera Epstein might have been murdered.   And on Barr's watch.   And not a peep about it.
"Re-elect Trump".
Except it's Trump who hides his meetings with Putin.   It's Republicans who bail out Wall St.   It's Republicans who use gov't funded health care &amp; lie about it.
I'll fight for politicians who do not take Wall Street bribes.   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   #JusticeDems are the people I will fight for.
Trump's executive orders are as effective as big pharma's anti depressant drugs.   Don't work but have deadly side effects.
I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is my choice.  I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is not a corporate toadie. I will NOT take it easy on Joe Biden on health care, filthy oil.  We did that for Hillary &amp; Trump outflanked her on her left and lost.   Biden has a chance. Wall St or Main St.
Respectfully, do you really think America believes Joe Biden is a champion of the working man?   He'll win only because Trump is so vile. If R's ran someone moderate against Biden, Biden would probably lose.
Precisely.   Also, Trump ran as a populist where Hillary tried but failed because America knows she's a corporate Dem.   They took a chance on Trump. Now we've got corporate Joe.   If election not stolen, Joe will win but not because America thinks he has their backs.
To pretend Biden is a champion of the working class will not work Tricia. It insults voters &amp; corporate Dems better grasp it.   They tried that with Hillary &amp; lost to Trump (who ran as a populist).   We will not earn Indie votes by insulting their intelligence.
shit RON, you said this same SHIT 6 MONTHS AGO!!  Where the HELL have you republicans BEEN?? NO TESTS, NO PLANS, TOO BUSY TRYING TO PROTECT DONALD J TRUMP'S FAILURES!!!!
You have had 4 years to address RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE INTO OUR DEMOCRACY, instead you want to HIDE the TRUTH and CONTINUE to push RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA in order to PROTECT DONALD J TRUMP. disgraceful, how much WILL YOU MAKE????
Had enough of U.S. Senators telling me "somebody better do something".   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump. The second he's sworn in, if he is, I'm working to elect a #Progressive in 2024.   #Enough of this crap. Zero left to give sir.
Does anyone know how long ago Trump started writing his name in Sharpie? In 1986 he began sending Graydon Carter pictures of his hands circled in Gold Sharpie. I'm sure everyone knows that story. I'm wondering about his signature because he's probably needed glasses that long!

I'm certain on his death bed John Lewis was still thinking of things to make world better place. Not lamenting missing Trump's tiny ignauguration.
Another reason I find solace in being an atheist. If there is a Jesus he weeps at the actions done by Trump and lackeys. And the lizards who fawn attention in hopes he furthers their agenda. White Supremacy Misogyny Christianity in schools No right to choose Homophobia ..amen.
Unfortunately Trump and his minions have convinced millions to fall in like lemmings. In an absurd belief he cares about them.
The debate isn't over whether young Black Americans will vote for Trump. The challenge is understanding what will they do at all when it comes to voting. Sadly, they do not articulate the issues well. And neither party is prioritizing their interests.
Well damn, I'm sure Putin has a place for the Trump's.
Before I block you, why was he despicable?  Was it his relationship with russian strongmen, girls accusing him of rape, the women whose genitalia he grabbed, his bankruptcies, or that he said he was sexually attracted to his daughter? Oops, that was trump
Donald J Trump is EXPENDABLE. He should STEP DOWN NOW!
Live, did I just feel republicans SHIVER? Trump live, what could possibly GO WRONG?
White moderates agreed to the 1872 Amnesty Act &amp; "Great Compromise" of 1877 with white supremacists. White moderates don't want systemic change. They don't value Black lives over the status quo because they are status quo beneficiaries. Biden's value? He isn't Trump. That's it.

#Trump’s Axios interview: #Bickering on #coronavirus stats  When the interviewer asks about the #150K who've #died, #tRUMP said, “They are #dying. That’s #true” “It is what it is" (WTF! #ItIsWhatItIs???) "It’s under control as much as you can control it.”
In March of 2017, China approved Donald Trump-branded spas, escort services and massage parlors without permission of Congress. If he signed legislation having to do with sex trafficking, he likely thought it was for, not against.
I have come to the following conclusion. Trump does not see COVIC as his responsibility at all. So long answer short. No. Absolutely not does trump give one iota of concern. If he can’t control something, he lets it go.
I am not a Christian. In the last decade or more my antipathy has grown as I've seen so called Christian leaders embracing Trump and those like him. Ralph Reed...Jerry Falwell jr...Pat Robertson and others.. Trying to remember there are good Christians. It's been a battle. Trying

“Why MLK Would Consider Donald Trump a Segregationist”
Compare and contrast the impact on the goodness of humanity of Trump and John Lewis. John Lewis and his colleagues will be proudly celebrated for shining a light on dark corners. Trump and his enablers a shameful chapter of history.

Actually, we're witnessing Republican strategy at work. The GOP doesn't just *allow* it. It is their actual dirty work on display by Trump. He's empowered to do as he pleases precisely because he is progressing an agenda established by the GOP before he was chosen to execute it.
Not even Donald Trump would vote for and support and protect Donald Trump. So no matter how stupid he is, or corrupt, or evil, those who support him should be the focus of a public lens of unending scrutiny. And they are unfortunately populating positions of power across the US.
Please note Trump's GOP approval rating every cycle over the past 4 years. There's literally tens of millions of White Americans who absolutely love dumpster diving for rotten chicken salad sandwiches with spoiled mayo. The sandwich isn't the problem. It's the people enjoying it.
Who thinks that Trump should be censured?  I do.
#ICYMI Trump's latest outrageous remarks about #JohnLewis should come as no surprise. Trump is a white supremacist, as he was in 1968 when he joined his dad's biz discriminating against Black folks &amp; opposing MLK. When Trump was inaugurated I wrote this:

Greatest example of Trump Derangement Syndrome.  At the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives, no less!
Trump is right.
We've seen investigations: Counterintel Mueller  State AG House Committees Senate Committees Inspectors General  What we haven't seen is accountability &amp; consequences. Trump does what he wants, when he wants &amp; how he wants. He destroys reputations, livelihoods &amp; lives w/impunity.
Did you mention Trump's friends?
The Trump administration's plan to provide every nursing home with a fast COVID-19 testing machine comes with an asterisk: The government won't supply enough test kits to check staff and residents beyond an initial couple of rounds.

Not a clue! Don’t think trump has any kinda clue! I don’t think he really cares if it kills Americans at an alarming rate
A little late for that. trump has been an embarrassment since being elected
Trump knows Birx isn't a politician. That's why he slaps her down. She has no power. No control. No constituents. He does. And we all know that no matter what Trump does he will retain the loyalty of conservative white supremacists in congress, state legislatures &amp; governorships.
Actually, Trump is correct. Until there's any real action taken to stop his daily trampling of constitutional laws, ethics &amp; morals that were presumed to be ingrained in institutional powers, he can do anything he damn well pleases. Dems incessant incredulity is meaningless.
Trump is right. Again. He isn't the problem. His supporters are. I wonder what the bible says about those who applaud evil?

Wrong trump dump of lies
Trump’s deep racist roots before becoming president include a real estate career steeped in redlining, a campaign to see the Central Park Five executed even after they were exonerated and, of course, his leading role in promoting the malignant lie that Obama was born in Kenya.

And the evidence condemns Donald.  "But we will not be used by Donald F--king Trump to incite violence against people who are speaking up about things that matter. We will not be mischaracterized by right wing ‘media’ as a neighborhood under siege by imaginary organizations...”
I don't think it was meant to be dismissive, though it came off a bit like that. I think it's an attempt to remind people that you're ultimately voting for *president* and to not let the inevitable coming petty disagreements over the #2 dissuade you from voting Trump out.
Well he's right if you consider that for trump's supporters, God is a Gun!  It's just spelled differently, but still only 3 letters that trump possibly could read off a teleprompter.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.

Trump gone drop twitter like a hot potato it’s a format of hate
Trump's speeches are like a K-Tel album of Fox News's greatest hits from the past 12 years.
Remember that one time Barack Obama said that one poorly chosen phrase about people "clinging to guns and God" and conservatives freaked out? Well, whether or not you remember it, President Trump sure does.
I think it's still ubiquitous and filters in, though. If you're casually on Facebook to check in on friends, for example, you're way more likely to see something about Trump or Fauci than your local public health dept unless your feed is very, very deliberately curated.
Glad to see that Fox News is drawing attention to this worrisome degradation in Trump's ability to speak clearly and pronounce words correctly.  We are all very concerned about him 😂

U.S. Democrats urge more coronavirus talks, say Trump can't solve problem by himself
I like a lot of what Trump has done—particularly concerning ProLife—but I’m beginning to be persuaded that he’s a narcissist.  I never voted for him, and I don’t know if I can bring myself to do it this November.  As  put it, our choice is a narcissism or senility.
And the evidence condemns Donald.  "But we will not be used by Donald F--king Trump to incite violence against people who are speaking up about things that matter. We will not be mischaracterized by right wing ‘media’ as a neighborhood under siege by imaginary organizations...”
I don't think it was meant to be dismissive, though it came off a bit like that. I think it's an attempt to remind people that you're ultimately voting for *president* and to not let the inevitable coming petty disagreements over the #2 dissuade you from voting Trump out.
Well he's right if you consider that for trump's supporters, God is a Gun!  It's just spelled differently, but still only 3 letters that trump possibly could read off a teleprompter.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.

Trump gone drop twitter like a hot potato it’s a format of hate
Trump's speeches are like a K-Tel album of Fox News's greatest hits from the past 12 years.
Remember that one time Barack Obama said that one poorly chosen phrase about people "clinging to guns and God" and conservatives freaked out? Well, whether or not you remember it, President Trump sure does.
I think it's still ubiquitous and filters in, though. If you're casually on Facebook to check in on friends, for example, you're way more likely to see something about Trump or Fauci than your local public health dept unless your feed is very, very deliberately curated.
Glad to see that Fox News is drawing attention to this worrisome degradation in Trump's ability to speak clearly and pronounce words correctly.  We are all very concerned about him 😂
Final thoughts..... We, as a reasonable people say " don't lump all ( insert group) into one" , try doing this for ex cons. We are not all the same.  God bless America and God bless President Trump.
My take on this.  I am an ex con. I am also an American.  My punishment was removal from society. Not removal of my civil rights. I live in Oregon, and my voting right was restored to me upon release, and I vote in every election. As is my right.  Trump 2020!

I'm actually not a Russia-gater, so not Vlad personally, but I do think Trump's done a lot of money-laundering for some sectors of the Russian oligarchy (via Deutchebank loan guarantee, for example).

Quite interesting.. esp. when Trump is being accused of profiting.
Trump literally said he grabs women by the pussy.
Trump is trying to suppress black votes by putting 50,000 "poll workers" at the precincts to challenge voters. To defend democracy, we need to go postal.
His opening move is the same old same old: all the Indians died from disease so it's ridiculous to talk about genocide.   (In fairness to Shapiro, I suppose, lots of Ph.D. historians say this too, and not all of them worship Trump).
What about the   &amp;  KNEW RUSSIA interferred in 2016 &amp; did nothing! They're doing NOTHING AGAIN in 2020, even after the ODNI announced that RUSSIA is working to reelect Trump &amp; discredit Biden. China is doing the opp favoring Biden! #HYPOCRISY
Here’s even BIGGER news for you, pre-existing conditions are already covered under the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare”. Trump is suing to overturn that coverage.

Dear Diary,  President Trump told a room full of people the truth today,  that the MSM are nothing but liars. He hurt my feelings and made me cry.
Are we in a Twilight Zone or something? They can’t be serious and try to credit trump for that...
Only Biden has said crappy things about the Black Community!!! Trump has Helped!!!
Agreed. He gets away with everything. No one can stop him. I’m thinking of doing my best not to hear any more trump news until he’s gone. Can’t take anymore.
You're a little late there, President Trump has already brought jobs back, had record low employment, didn't sell us out to China and put America first. Joe can't do anything President Trump hasn't already done. Keep up Kamala Joe won't be President ever.

Trump is trying to sabotage the USPS—slow down the mail service, delay ballots, and block vote-by-mail. We must do everything that we can to remove Trump this November. #SaveTheUSPS
Trump’s political crony managing the #USPS has made significant changes to postal operations, which has already slowed mail delivery across the country. Tonight he went further and executed a Friday night massacre— firing USPS managers who run the day to day postal operations.

the incumbent's re-elect requires making it easier for russian operatives to "vote" and harder for registered voters not identified as white "values" consumers.  is it really that hard to say both halves of trump re-elect?
Geraldo is on the wrong side of History! Trump can't even complete a normal sentence.
Once Trump is out of office I predict they will do a thorough audit and be able to charge him with embezzlement of taxpayers money. Even if the statute of limitations expires on his old crimes we know he's committed new ones as president. Guilty as Sin!

People on the left keep saying that Trump is taking away rights and trying to be a dictator, but it was the governors who actually suspended Constitutional rights without due process. I wrote in last time rather than vote for either one. The left pushed me to vote Trump now.
Compare that focus with those “on the left” who—two associate Justices ago—proclaimed that a term of Trump would hasten their “revolution.”

"A constant of the Trump administration has been escalation in the absence of accountability." It's time for some accountability, America. Don't worry. It won't be that bad. Creating a just society is good for all of us.
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.

Trump is older than Biden, and Biden leads a healthier lifestyle. Your worries are misplaced. Also, if the worst happens, we have Kamala Harris.
Thats Biden's entire "campaign". Don't take questions from almost anybody.
I think you meant to write: Ah, you are obviously a Biden supporter. You can't even speak English! LOL I speak AND write Russian, and write, and speak English; I also correct poor attempts at writing in English, by skinhead wannabe Nazi sympathizers.
The nutcase probably has Alzheimers, his father died from it.  Biden doesn't have dementia, he does have a stutter that  makes him have to change the word he is trying to use midstream when his first choice won't come out, he is all there, no matter what the Twitler lovers say.
You don't deny it. I see a lot of gendered hate against Kamala that I wouldn't expect to have seen if Joe Biden had picked a man. Rather than criticizing her policy, you meme about her being a woman in a sexual way. I don't appreciate it.
bernie was on his save the post office grind early and we got biden. democrats are the ones stoping real change not republicans
I would say that her life is in grave danger.  Maxwell would be very inconvenient to an incoming Biden Administration. I would imagine that an aneurysm or heart attack would be listed as the cause of death
go look what the #fauxtrage from #reichwingdeathcult about Biden's son when he died from cancer. Or a host of number of other progressive politicians passed. And i'm sorry for the loss of the #WrongTrump
Yeah but even without approval voting, Warren did way better than Harris. she had more votes and pledged delegates than 26 of the 29 candidates. She raised vastly more money than Harris, both for her own campaign and for Joe Biden.

Suppose that Biden adds 2 to SCOTUS. What's to prevent the next opposition President from expanding SCOTUS by 5 or even 10 Justices? Eventually, you would have a Supreme Court with over 100 Justices! This is very extreme, I know; but you get the general idea!

Don’t push for Biden in this election and I will start believing in you.

In Iowa, and around the country, polls are showing older voters trending toward Joe Biden and away from President Trump—a potentially tectonic development.

Contrast that to all the trashing on the Right of Hunter Binden not that long after Joe Biden lost Beau to cancer. That tells you all you need to know about the right
"Biden floated (at the time) baseless election card conspiracy later confirmed by Trump."
Biden would have nukes him. Funny how diplomacy works right?
As long as Biden continues to be indistinct from Trump on the issues of healthcare, foreign policy and climate change, I couldn’t really care less which right winger occupies the plantation house.
Man I wish they would have let Biden stick his foot in his mouth for the millionth time! Mr. Gaff machine is going to go down hard in the debates. Funny how he’s no longer a racist/sexist like Kamala said he was in the Dem debates. 🤔
Donny J Trump is hindering his chances at being reelected by slowing postal service during the age of CPVID-19.  Vote Biden/Harris by November 3 and restore sanity to America.
I’ve noticed the anti Biden and Harris memes a lot lately. When I bring up the fact that 1. This only helps trump and 2. This is exactly what happened last time, I’m called a boomer and laughed off.   I laugh bc that is not going to stop me at all.
You'd half to be an absolute moron to think that Biden had anything to do with that, that he condones that, and that it has anything to do with him. This has so much more to do with Trump. This is his America. These are the seeds he has sown.
This is very scary because it indicates Democrats have no idea how their health care laws actually work and what problems what new problems this bill would cause.
Concert instead.  Its the best joe biden can do.
Donny J Trump is going to face FEDERAL prosecution for  infringing on AMERICAN'S constitutionally protected right to vote freely and safely for Biden/Harris by mail in the age of COVID-19.  The clubhouse crook will be guilty as charged.
⁦ failure. It’s not the Democrats holding up funding for USPS, and Covid 19 relief package. It Is You!!!!
Obama / Biden love #Privatization. LOVE IT.
After the election (voting for Biden/Harris and no Republicans) I'm switching parties....
Prayers for the Trump Family... They're looking at many criminal charges when My President Biden and VP Kamala take office! 🤭
But Biden is leading Trump by 7%!?!?
Do any of you have an argument for voting Biden/Harris as a means of harm reduction, or as part of a long term political strategy? I'm looking around and just don't see it.
This is where we'll have to agree to disagree. Statistically, the winner is guaranteed to be Dem or GOP. I believe "not as bad as tRump" to be a gross oversimplification, but even if it weren't, I'd still vote for the only one that can best tRump, and that's Biden.
Biden should put his big boy pants on and give us something to vote for. He needs to EARN my vote, and so far he's failing miserably. Today he even took the public option off the table. He offers us nothing and you demand we vote for that?
Biden would definitely win if Christians write-in "Jesus."
I feel your pain sister. At least my daughter-in-law votes. She's a Berner but has already told me she's voting for Biden because she knows if she doesn't she's in effect casting a vote for trump and she'd NEVER do that. She's too smart.
She will likely be secretary of state if Biden wins.
This is Susan Rice, the likely Secretary of State for Joe Biden.  Questioning Trump because he wants to look at pardoning Snowden.  This is the people you support democrats: Warmongers who want their secrets protected.  #VOTETHEMOUT #NEVERBIDEN
🤣🤣🤣 So ridiculous. Reminds me of Bushisms from back in the day. Still think Biden is actually losing it, though. Trump’s just a bad public speaker. Not voting for either though, so ;-)
I stood up for Biden the other day.  Someone said that Biden wasn't worth a pile of shit.  I told the guy that he was.
Oregon’s Leading Republican Political Strategist Explains Why He’ll Vote for Joe Biden
Biden campaign summed up with one #TikTok. #TRUMP2020
No it’s not. But if “better than trump” is the only other realistic choice, then as much as it sucks, that’s the one we have to pick. Or we can continue letting trump destroy this country. Your call. I detest biden but it’s not really a question to me.
so yall think biden getting trump outta here? 😂😂😂😭😭
Biden's not anti police, &amp; while I don't personally see him toady empty rhetoric - Law &amp; Order jig to prove loyalty, Its understood that the POTUS has the full force of arms at his disposal - Biden knows the drill back &amp; forward.
Neither. We need to get the fuck together and sort shit out. Trump and Biden are both shit and what's worse is that we're letting them be shit.
And then Biden will get another trump elected.
Many of Biden's questions were prearranged.
Does he know that he's asking people not to vote for him?  Really, his mouth is Biden's best ad maker.
Is somebody telling him that or is he just making it up? Seriously - Joe Biden should *not* debate this man!
But trump is embarrassing because he says stupid shit. Biden is better at hiding that he's a douchebag. 😉 Sarcasm aside, Trump has done good shit at killing the US empire imperialism but it's because of his own interest or stupidity every time it happens. So, he can be better.🤷‍♂️
Hahaha so not Biden? His answer to “what if we do a name search in Delaware” (referring to an accuser) was “[indiscernable]” 🤣🤣 Get that guy off the promoter and he can’t complete a thought much less a sentence lol
I've donated a total of $13 to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' campaign. Think of all the tater tots I could have gotten instead. At least 6.  Help make my money worth it by voting early this November! Don't let the forgotten tots go to waste! #VoteTrumpOut #VoteBlue
I mean...the answer to, "is Biden less of a warmonger than Trump?", is, "yes."  If it was, "imperialist", then you've got grounds for discussion. But "warmonger" is more specific. With Biden it would be a hyperbolic distinction for rhetorical effect. With Trump, it's literal.
Refers to many incidents where women say Biden was too familiar,  but that the touching wasn't sexual.    Incidents occurred in public.  Biden hasn't denied them, so I'm sure Harris "believes" them now as she did then.  If any video to contrary, please link.
Obama was just Bush II in Blackface.   Biden will just be Trump in Pinkface. 🤣
#MyGutTellsMeThat our national nightmare will soon be over when Joe Biden is President of the United States.
Sorry. We have idiots in this country who have fallen victim to MSM. They aren’t voting for Biden’s policies (I don’t know if any tbh).  These useful idiots are voting solely for the fake narrative that “Orange Man is Bad”..
What would you expect them to do? Biden is a private citizen and Harris is currently in Senate minority. Trump and his cronies are currently in charge and he gutted FEMA disaster relief funds to pay for wall and unemployment benefits - by his executive orders.
It is possible. If Biden’s campaign actually started supporting real progressive policies. Instead he’s trying to rely on Trump being terrible.   Dont underestimate Trump. Hillary did in 2016 and look where that got us.   #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
Which, a local endorsement is weird, right? My school district has a small union that is part of east county, which is a part of oregon, which is a part of the NATIONAL education association. NEA endorsed Biden. PAT (Portland Public School's Union) didn't endorse president...
You’ve heard it first from Daniel with the American flag in his name. Taylor Swift will have no money left if Joe Biden wins. God speed, Taylor.
You do know that Biden is a private citizen right now? He does not even have a vote in congress. But cutting SS is NOT his position. This from the campaign website:
I'm not a Biden fan. But all I want from him is his signature. He needs to be too afraid of us to veto or derail legislation he finds too progressive. That's why I'm contributing to 4 Senate + 7 House candidates, &amp; why I'll have no problem criticizing him loudly &amp; in the streets.
A game to get Biden elected. I think many media of color struggle with whether to name it and give it power or ignore it. This may sound like an easy choice but it’s nuanced.  highlights that we’re all here again. What are we gonna do? I’m not gonna shoot the messenger
Other: Trick question. Biden &amp; Harris already won the primary on the back of DNC corruption with the msm propaganda machine defeating Bernie &amp; #NotMeUs  And, just as in 2016 where we would've avoided Trump because #BernieWouldHaveWon in a landslide, #BernieWouldHaveWon in 2020
Opinion | Trump stokes fear. Biden and Harris can raise hope.
Two people who have no reason to lie in this scenario, and who have considerably more access to insider information than either of us do.   Health insurance stocks sure don't seem to be intimidated by a potential biden victory.
That he picked Harris as VP is all the more reason I will eagerly vote for Joe Biden.
The FCC #FairnessDoctrine was a policy requiring the holders of broadcast licenses to present issues of public importance in a manner that was honest, equitable, and balanced. GOP eliminated the policy and Fox News was launched. #FauxNews #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Kamala #Biden
I think if Biden loses in November we should throw Tom Perez into a volcano.
Anybody who votes for biden-harris is a scumbag in my book
"Dan Lavey, who has advised and run campaigns for leading #Oregon #Republican candidates, including former U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith &amp; past GOP nominees for governor Chris Dudley and Knute Buehler...explains why he'll vote for Joe #Biden in November."
When Trump steps on freedom of press, people are rightfully angry at his fascism.  But when the Biden and the establishment Dems do it to leftist journalists that are critical of them? Where's the outrage then?
The basic argument for electing Biden, boiled down to one sentence.
Biden was Obama's Lieberman, he's way to the right of Obama.   And the evidence has always been there in his record, and continues to be there in the contemporaneous statements of party leaders and actions of his campaign.  WAKE THE FUCK UP.
Democrats are used to having people do what they want.  Look at  believing “you ain’t black” if an African-American votes for   Biden personifies the party of slavery, the Conferderacy, and segregation.
Stemming the tide of authoritarianism inthe ethnic-nationalist state is the only reason why I’m voting for Biden.
I will not vote for Biden because I don’t want to
We found out today we're not even getting a public option out of the Biden administration, at a time when 100 million people can't afford to see a doctor, during a global pandemic.  You want people on the left to vote for Biden, work on changing that.
Well have you seen Biden post? About Americans having a shot. Black and Brown? Well I've asked him what about Whites ? And for sure for myself?  And I also stated Trump does nothing either to protect my family or those 1000 plus out of Oregon.
Ok, who’s down to see the Kanye / Biden Presidential debate?
Back in reality:  Obama built it. Trump broke it. Biden will fix it.
I’d love to see the Kanye / Biden Presidential debate.  That would be awesome!!!!

Yes I would. Hidin’ Biden is all they have.
Joe Biden is a scared bastard to face President Trump and have is why
Against, like last time. It’ll be like 8 people who live in Brooklyn and dc tweeting not to vote for Biden that will be trotted out for years
Bahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!  That’s the first Biden flags I’ve seen
Why Biden &amp; Harris need to be elected, and Democrats need to flip the Senate and expand control of the House. So Federal laws and database on bad cops can be created.    ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
“By the way, you know, I sit on the stand and it’d get hot. I got a lot of — I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun,” Biden said. “And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.” -Biden
I have avoided punching right at all because it matters but like yeah this is absolutely right. Happened in 2016. If Biden somehow drops this I am not excited for a lot of things but also for the backlash on the left
We need you to SPECIFICALLY encourage people to vote for Joe Biden, by name.
and keep an eye out for DONYA   they are gonna. drag her through the mudd. biden is. NOT. obama t
Sanders was the only one trying to block it because the other Dems weren’t opposed to Obama privatizing the Post Office the way they are opposed to Trump doing it.  Important to remember under any Biden admin. Yes? 🤔
Probably not. Why pick on Cenk when we’ve got Biden/Harris to talk about?

I didn't like her famous attack on him a year ago, but checked on my memory was right:
Clearly, Biden is right.  Otherwise we would be open like so many other countries that have handled this better than we did.  Given the fact we have 25% of the worlds deaths this hasn’t been handled by Mr. whine baby.
Let him mumble Biden will rule
A lot worse if Trump wins.  They're counting on fear of rioting and destruction to make people vote Biden. Vote Trump!  Don't cower in front of these people.
He look everyone. Joe Biden the REAL President we need can spell and use correct Grammer unlike the Klan chowder in office
Or asthma, like Biden.
Democrats really want mail in ballots so that they can have illegals, dead people, cats, and dogs cast votes for Biden.   Yikes.
100% correct.  When Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris are elected, along with enough Democrats to flip the Senate and expand control of the House, we will have one of the greatest years that we've ever had.
15 year old boy in Atlanta dies from COVID. No other conditions.  Tell his family kids are immune.  MWhat if it were Barron?  You can’t bury him at the White House. Can you imagine?  People are starving in America for Gods sake.   Well Biden won’t let that happen
Can’t think of a better reason to vote for Biden and Harris
For die-hard 3rd party voters who refuse to vote for Biden, you can stand on your principles if you’ll stand next to the children in their cages on the border. Get over yourselves and do what’s best for Trump’s trauma victims. #StoptheDonald
I am sending you lots of good vibes!! Is there anything else I can do (I know, replace the President with Biden. I am working on it!) Seriously if you need to chat and need a friend, that is what I am here for! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
You do clothes and music really well. Biden and Harris won’t tell you how to do clothes and music. Don’t tell them (or us) how to run for President.
sweeties 4 bernie 4 biden
After 5.5 months of solidly politicising the coronavirus, Trump criticizes Biden for politicising the coronavirus.  And Biden is only restating current CDC recommendations.  Six months in, and we still have no national plan. And it shows in 168,000 deaths and rising.
What about making the A in Harris into a star to compliment the stripes of Biden E?
While this is all mostly from industry people and senior congressional aides, that's usually how the walk back starts, and there is also this glaring bit.  "The Biden campaign did not respond when asked whether Biden would push for a public option right away or start smaller."
Wonder if the DNC can just throw up video montages of 45 saying racist/misogynistic/hateful statements over and over again at his rallies in place of most of Joe Biden’s debate responses?
I can’t wait to vote for Biden and still be blamed if he loses.
I used to think Trump would win, then like a month or 2 ago I started feeling like Biden would come out ahead, now with the postal service shit I’m starting to change my mind again and have no idea what to actually think lol
Empty vessel Biden..
via    Republicans proving yet again that they are Gouty Old Patriarchs; Trump is whining like the pitiful loser he always has been.
too humid.
Kamala Harris is the same as most people. If she thinks it benefits her then it doesn’t matter who it hurts .?Even if she lies to get her way . Probably learned it was ok 👌🏽 from Ms Clinton ! Biden is same !
I'm not certain why people argue Sanders' message was better when (1) he lost decisively to Biden among Democratic primary voters and (2) consistently polled slightly worse than Biden in general election matchups
You see that the party is already saying no public option?  Convention hasn't even happened yet.
Hey Ro, what do you have to say about the revelation that we aren't even getting a public option out of Biden?
And he calls Biden sleepy? Fuckin snooze fest bruh.
The amount of privilege these dinguses have to be able to say "the differences between Trump and Biden are so minor that the results will not affect me"
Im not with the democratic party so again, please try to stay on topic. You still havent shown me how you know trump isnt a pedophilic rapist but Biden is.
Do you really wanna start talking about meetings in the White House? Really? You start down that path you’re going to piss Donald Trump off Biggly. Anything the Bidens did was outdone by Trump a hundred times. #Biden
It's the beginning. They are working hard. Jeanine Pirro said Biden won't be on the ballot in 2 months. I don't know what her plan is and how she knows. Everything is overlooked, no one does shit about it. Get your pop corn!

Levin: Kamala Harris is SUICIDE for Democrats and Joe Biden  via
Biden AND trump are pedophiles, most people in office are! Idk why that is hard for you to grasp if you believe Biden is one.
You are literally a propagandist. He absolutely shouldn't be on your show being asked about Obama gate and hunter biden and dementia and rioters. He doesn't need to participate in russian interference just because you whine
biden's whole platform is "at least it's not trump"
So now show me your proof for believing Biden is a pedophile, I'd like to know why you say hes one but Trump, who has much more damning evidence against him, is not?
Trump doesn't answer questions, he crafts word salads that circle back to some vaguely connected falsehood, like "Nobody believed we could shut down China..." (He didn't, as you know...) So Biden's got nothing to prove on that score. (And yet his lead is stable. Carry on, Joe...)
She was the most diverse person in Biden’s Binder of Women for VP candidates.
How much more receptive r White ppl r to hearing it from Bidrn w/ a WOC as his backup, in a supportive role we've been conditioned to accept. Is it just BLM progress or would we have heard Obama, could he have been as explicit as Biden can?  Was he and I ignored it?
Nate, so does Oregon. Zero chance here. I'm no Trumpalo, so whats the stort, get Oregon whining and then play it to the base?...Always something....I hate both majors. Writing in somebody at this point Gary Johnson but Biden certainly takes Oregon so no wasted.
Ideas are actually ownable. What ideas and where they go is the province of the other 2/3 of IP law, which have been getting way out of hand. Hey, will Joe Biden fix that? Might make me vote for him if so.
Obama shares his troubling private doubts on Biden to inner circle. 😂😂😂
Ah but they're confused. They must've mis-spoke!   Of course Biden's against STEAL, as in "stealing the election," or "stealing a bunch of money from the government for his private golf courses and hotels." 😎
I especially like how he's opposed federal funding of abortions for the vast majority of his entire career until he very credibly pivoted right before being named VP, just like Joe Biden.

Good news folks, the party is abandoning the public option before the convention.  We've already pushed Biden to the left, saying we'd crawl over broken glass to vote against Trump is paying dividends, not a single one of us is getting played or extorted.
Keep in mind Biden has become more progressive after working with Sanders &amp; Warren. And bringing Harris onto the ticket means he is showing he’s willing to listen to the people.  Enough said.
AND if we can get the right Congress, they can put forward amazing legislation that Biden will sign. But we have to push for the right reps, the right senate, and elect someone who we can work to bring this country along towards the 21st century.
Pretty tired of the anti-Biden ‘left’ who say he isn’t as progressive as they’d like. Yes, he should be more prog. BUT we can move him towards more progressive ideals

Biden: 'A Black Woman Will Become President Over My Dead Body'  via
Sounds like Biden supporters need to show up and boo that turd off the stage, then.
Is this what happens when you don’t vote for Biden?
If Biden was hoping that Kamala would lock up the Black vote for him, he could be very sad after a Rasmussen poll found that 36% of Blacks say they are less likely to vote for him with her on the ticket. That’s a big number and if BLM is consistent, they’ll not like Harris as VP.
Hey Hillary , ask Joe Biden he's pretty tight with China, maybe they could ship another virus before the election.
Nevermind you're just a Biden astroturf account and not a real boy.
Reading #ThePassageofPower right now &amp; there are SO many similarities between the JFK/LBJ &amp; O/Joe relationships. JB had closer friendship with his boss but he &amp; LBJ were both effective Senate horsetraders  dismissed as archaic, unrefined and less educated.
Gee it's almost like all the progressive who pointed out Biden's plans were bullshit were right.  "the party would start next year with a more modest package of fixes to ObamaCare that did not include a public option in an effort to get some early points on the board."
Go ahead.  Vote biden.  Aint gonna stop this
Tell that to Biden.  The squad is establishment 2.0  We see you.  hypocrites.
Yeah better than Biden same coin two sides. Trump still a piece of trash human being but as president is mediocre/decent. Again better than Biden tbh

Nope.  I am voting for Biden. I want a POTUS who is not owned by Putin!
She knows "without a doubt" that Biden is a Pedo, but her hatred for Trump compels her to dish out this crap!  Please check your moral compass!!!
This. I am so sick of the utter SELFISHNESS of "protest" voting (or not). There are 2 *legitimate* choices: Biden, or Trump. Anything else, whether you LIKE the choices or not, means you're acting like a child and can't see the ramifications for others, if not you.
Kamala said the other day that Biden looks for those he can raise up. Trump is focused on who he can tear down.
A 3rd party vote is a vote for Biden👏 Not voting is voting for Biden👏  Wait...

Partisanship has brainwashed you. You're now just straight up denying provable facts.   The prosecutor was corrupt and the Western world wanted him removed. He was not investigating Burisma. Had Biden been corrupt, keeping him in his post would have been better.

I will work with my local Indivisible group and  to call and write voters to encourage them to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  What will you do?
Given both Trump and Biden's ages and health...this matters. She could easily become POTUS and I want someone who has ethics and does her job. She never responded to what she did.
This is exactly what makes him a good businessman I don’t think this ad is doing what Biden thinks it does
Biden/ Harris is not far to the left.
If we can get a Biden administration, dem senate, and house - let's not get lazy when it is time to vote in midterms and call representatives. It is way easier than what we have been doing! If Dems had voted in 2010 in 2008 numbers, I think the whole world would look different
People telling themselves there will be a primary in 2024 are engaging in fantasy.   If Biden stays in, no primary, if he is going to drop out, he'll do it just before, or just after the midterms, then Harris is the incumbent, and again no primary.
Yes. They want to return to the way it was under O__ma &amp; Biden, the good ol' days for them when they had free reign to rip off and cripple America.

Nic, I respectfully disagree. Obama-Biden Administration handed over the entire Middle East on a platter to Turkey under the guise of "Arab Spring" so I suspect Biden here is merely scoring a point against Trump by attacking a vulnerable issue..
Why won’t Twitter let me send a gif of Biden and Harris?
I haven't honestly found this to be true, Sanders supporters are always very quick to drag him when he does things we don't like, including endorsing Biden.
What is BS is Trump’s bully name calling. He started with “sleepy Joe” and Biden scores with a single video
Biden work's for china. NOT USA.
I think it ended up being closer to 60k, that were invalidated in Washington State.  The gap between Bernie and Biden was only like 20k.  I bet most of the 60k ‘non party’ voters weren’t voting for Biden.

Are you voting for Biden? If not, why are you still a racist piece of shit?
The statement "It was a debate" IS an answer. Contesting one another for their party's nomination inherently involves examining who best reflects what the party as a whole wants to offer. Notice than Biden makes a swipe back (which fails, IMO) to question Harris' record.
Biden's are a corruption machine!
Here's the exchange in its entirety. She's careful to say that she think Biden isn't a racist and that he's done other good things, but on this issue she finds his record wanting:
I agree with you, but voter suppression is one of two major factors I'm considering.   The second being that he has a unified voter base and Biden simply doesn't.
I don't drink but  it will be "Trump is a racist, bigot, xenophobic, bad man,  settle for Biden'
My husband and I are FuckTrumpers! We hate everything he stands for! Yet my husband insists on putting our flag up because he says he will not allow Trump to steal his love of his country. I’ve ordered Biden signs so when he flys the flag it’s next to a dump Trump and Biden2020
Both guys are brilliant. Either would make an excellent choice for COS in the Biden Admin.
And Biden holds a 64 % approval rating for black voters  , fun fact jack .
Step 1: gin up fear about the virus to push all to vote-by-mail  Step 2: make it look like Trump is after USPS to delay votes Step 3: encourage everyone to vote 2 weeks early  Step 4: delay Trump/Biden debate until a week before the election  Step 5: Profit.
Biden speech will be covered, Trump's won't lol

Fake news , Im sure Biden and Harris are just waiting to win the election to cure COVID-19. Or maybe it will just go away because it’s just a over reach to tear down the economy and make Trump look bad .
After Newsweek’s conspiracy theory fiasco, you have the GALL to assume we’d even read this shit about Biden? SMH 🤦🏻‍♀️
Schools will open after Biden is elected.
Biden - "listen, man, back in my day, we knew...we had to figure it out, man. the Bulgarians, they could pour the best jack and coke" and then i'd dedicate it to Felix  Trump - "that girl who made fun of Samantha's 7th grade poetry, Frumpy Lizzie, I call her... Pathetic! SAD!"
Obama/Biden put more kids in cages at the borders and lost track of them
Biden’s running entirely on Not dismantling the USPS and putting Not as many children in cages and Not repealing environmental protections which, because of current events, is now enough for me
Their key to victory, off the top of my head, involves taking full advantage of the power of rumor; getting as many people as possible to know that Biden is merely an accidental conduit for what could be the first female president. Gets likers and haters talking about it nonstop.
Im too angry to follow anyone. Im so tired of reading how ppl still refuse to vote bc they think Biden is as bad as trump.
People’s fear of losing to Trump overrode any excitement her campaign might have generated. But now that we have a “safer” candidate in Biden, people are more comfortable embracing the Harris thrill.
Please don’t call me a liberal. I’m a progressive who is quite a bit to the left of Bernie. And I have no faith that Biden/Harris will get anything done. If they started fighting for real fundamental changes then maybe they’d change my mind, but I don’t see that happening.
Understandable to not be thrilled with Biden/Harris. Understandable to wish you had better options. Not understandable to not vote.   And there’s no way you could possibly know that not voting won’t affect the outcome, especially given the disenfranchisement.
So do I. But again I’m not talking about blame. I’m talking about taking actions that will actually effect change. And Biden/Harris deserve plenty of criticism. But not voting in this election is not going to get Leftists what they want. Precisely the opposite.
Since you like to make moral appeals maybe watch that bearing false witness. Nobody supports abortion all the way up until birth with rare exceptions. Certainly not Biden. You cannot prove otherwise.

Lol. Now do Biden!
I don’t know what other people are saying. I’m saying, if you’re not voting because you didn’t get the ticket you wanted, whether that was Pete/Tulsi or Bernie/AOC, I think you’re being selfish and short-sighted. You think Biden was my first choice?
Actually, we can’t go there.  They won’t have us.
And Biden never had to pay off porn stars.
I know you loath Trump. But, Could you accept a reality where Trump wins fair and square?   For what Biden is bringing to the table... it seems like democrats want Trump to win.
I will crawl across a bed Broken glass shards with fire ants stuffed down my pants and murder hornets swarming me to vote for Biden/Harris
I still can't believe we're stuck with Biden.
It’s not a popular vote. It’s still the Electoral College, so all Trump has to do is siphon off a few votes in a few key states, and yes people choosing not to vote because of issues with Biden/Harris could absolutely make a difference.
dude.  Angela Davis is settling for Biden... what do you know that she doesn’t know?  i was so conflicted about this stuff, but the “settle for Biden” account has helped me through this.  NO president can do it without massive outside organizing

Biden is smarter than your average bear
Just a notice that having a giant Biden/Harris banner on your twitter account and then tweeting #NoComradesUnder1k #NoComradeLeftBehind makes you a hypocrite. Being a moderate on a democrat ticket is literally the opposite of a comrade.

One of the most highly anticipated moments of the Democratic National Convention will be Monday, when Michelle Obama will deliver an address that is expected to shine a harsh light on President Trump while urging Dems to get out and vote.
4. Literally the only way we can fix those barriers is if Biden/Harris wins, so vote now and fix the barriers after.
"Okay, I'll sniff" - Joe Biden when he has similar questions.
Can we please stop pretending Joe Biden would be a good president? He'll be less shit than Trump but still shit lol
WRONG  Real-Americans overwhelmingly support Joe Biden and Kamal Harris.  Only anti-American, racist pieces of sh*t support Trump and the GOP.

Who new settling could feel THIS bad?  Biden/Harris 2020
Biden wants a new job without an interview. Time to start taking questions, Joe!
We need people with platforms to publicly encourage their followers to vote for Joe Biden, regularly. Continued messaging is the best antidote to misinformation
Any fair win for Biden/Harris would have required a fair primary. Trump need not steal what the DNC has already stolen. With Trump or Biden we all lose. I’m hoping for a Green miracle.
At the very least Progressives who can imagine voting for Biden should be demanding a primary in 2024 for their vote today.  AT THE VERY LEAST.  If Harris becomes President before 2024 the party will do everything it can to avoid primaries.
Biden wants our vote? Start taking questions like the President.

Joe Biden and Mike Pence are both married to teachers. One works at a private school that hatefully discriminates against LGBT students and teachers. One works at a community college that welcomes all &amp; she speaks out in support of LGBT students.  will be great 1st Lady.
President Biden is going to be an excellent president! I can't wait to #VoteOutTrump and also  #VoteOutTheGOP! 🙌🏽🙌🏽
Trump knows DOZENS of black people who support him. Thats not proof. Group think isn't evidence and anecdotal evidence is, at best, misleading. Black voters chose joe biden in a landslide and will again. Your lies and propaganda wont change those facts
Hahaha namecalling? Nice 😂  You’ve done it! We’re all voting for your boy Biden now! 😂
It's very silly that we're still pretending like BIden and not the downers made this choice.
Joe Biden can’t run.  He waddles.  He has no memory.  Harris is a gaslighter.  You people are toast.  Bye Bye.
She won't be able to if Biden and Harris win this election.
No.  Whether someone is or isn’t officially “running” is not dispositive.  It’s clear from the article (and those who remember 2015) that Obama put a thumb on the scales to dissuade Biden from officially running.  A world-historical mistake.
Nope.  It’s because Obama and his staff pushed Biden out in 2016, leading to the nomination of the only person Trump could beat.
yes, but it’s strange that that’s the only “policy” this person mentioned, and it highlights that Biden’s primary message is “i’m not trump”
Biden-Harris are not playing to win, they're playing not to lose. My old coach said that ensures defeat.
Biden-Harris are not playing to win, they're playing not to lose. My old coach said that ensures defeat.
I understand &amp; ik it seems counterintuitive to not walk the road that “gets us to the final goal”, but the fact is, it never was going to get us there. Biden/Kamala is meant to keep us happy in the meantime, the fact any1 accepts it is already a winning factor for those in power.
And you can look this up - Democrat’s started the KKK. Biden voted for Jim Crow laws and told people they aren’t black if they don’t vote for him... you’ve been branded
This is basically what it is like to go to Harvard from a public high school.  Weird elitist signaling everywhere and gunners getting the calls.
Biden and Harris are coming for you, in 2021 blondie! ✊🏽 You think we stupid or what...😂
Will J. Biden donate anything if he was President? Someone should ask that of him if he ever has a debate.
My President Trump can answer any question he feels like. If a fake news reporter asks him a stupid question, he has every right to walk away. He is the president,  he is entitled. Joe Biden is running for president. He has no such entitlement.
If Biden walks out into the forest after he is defeated by Trump on Nov. 3rd, we may never see him again. Maybe his handlers should fit him with a tracking collar - just in case.
He won’t be impeached lol. Ima vote for him and he will be president because my vote matters the most in the election so if I want trump to be president he damn well will be our president. Sorry snowflake go cry your liberal tears to joe Biden or his boyfriend kamala

And by no means am I saying that we should silence people who have very legitimate issues with Biden/Harris, but I am saying that not voting in this election because you didn’t get the perfect ticket seems pretty damn selfish and short-sighted.
Anti-pattern on the Biden campaign’s email unsubscribe page. I tried to unsubscribe three times before noticing the big email form on the page is actually a subscribe form!
Even the fact checkers are having trouble keeping up... Headline should be: “Biden Forewarnings of Trump Election Conspiracies Confirmed by President Himself.”

lol who knows, maybe it can happen but, we will never get there by touting the same solutions of complacency, by acknowledging Biden/Kamala as our “saving bid against Trump” people will remain complacent to the system.  playing along w this broken system isn’t realistic either.
Nothing in that video is false. It's just taking Hannity's false claims about Biden &amp; Harris &amp; juxtaposing them with footage of Trump doing those things. He's such a Trumpocrite
“Want”, I don’t think so. But I think they know they can’t win. The polls are blatantly bogus. There is zero enthusiasm for Biden.   The question is what’s the Dems’ plan once DJT is re-elected? Gap likely too large to cheat in the election.  My guess is more of what we’ve seen.
I can’t even see your replies are you deleting them out of embarrassment? At least we know you’re black enough for joe Biden because you beg strangers for money online.
Joe Biden campaign hats are made in the USA by union labor. MAGA hats are made in China. Enough said.

Biden supporters are okay with fascism, they just don't want to say it out loud.  #NeverBidenNeverTrump
Yeah, the Iraq War that Biden was also rattling his saber for.   And before I thank the republicans for watering down the ACA, I should thank the Democrats for bringing a Right Wing healthcare plan to the table to be watered down instead of #singlepayer. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Okay fine, I’ll make a trade off: i will give as much effort to voting for Biden as Biden gives to running on and enacting #MedicareForAll. How’s that sound, Bob?

1. He’s right.  2. Where was Eric when the NYT was trashing our best chance to beat Trump and slurring Tara Reade?  Eric has helped to prop up the Biden/Harris kamikaze ticket by trashing the alternative too.
Every arrow in your quiver...here are some additional arrows:
hillbilly is not going to testify. She’s being prepared to work for Biden. One last chance to be in the White House. And these biased political judges saw to it she is free to do so ONCE AGAIN
No actually you’re the one who is slow to figure out that voting for Biden won’t change a thing.  Voting the lesser evil got us Trump and will get us another more capable Trump in the future.  Even slow learners might learn.

Trump’s voting support for re-elect has dropped 5 points. We always said that if we could move that number 5-7% Biden could win. Now more than ever, Faith organizing matters for this election #BidenHarris2020
Okay, here’s where we are: Trump is in the White House due in no small part to Joe Biden’s 40+ year career. The Dems have spent the last 4 yrs handing Trump infrastructure to do fascism. And a Joe Biden presidency will only set the stage for an even worse Trump down the line.
I just know you wouldn’t be getting Biden.
I'm thinking that the REAL reason Trump hates voting by mail is that it diffuses any October surprise. With people voting weeks before the election, there's no opportunity to blast some lie (TBD) that he hopes would draw votes from Biden.
Because there is nothing. To be honest I doubt they care. Like 'her emails' and 'the Hunter Biden investigation' it's not the proof they need but only the accusation to plant the seed of doubt in voters minds. Too many people think if it wasn't true no one could say or print it.
Climate justice. Biden plans to spend $2 trillion, which is a start, but his other stated commitments are for 1-4 decades past the day he leaves office, so... not exactly something he can be held accountable for.
And Biden shoots himself in the foot by picking Harris, the worst choice.  Your point?????
I wasn't going to vote for Joe Biden, but electing Kamal Harris as VP makes me want to vote for them EVEN LESS! #NeverBiden #NeverKamala
Only if they vote for her and Biden, or at the very least NOT trump.   #BadFaithRepublicans exploit the decency of others. Talk is cheap in the age of trump, so words must be followed up with actions.  They're like Eddie Haskels on coke, the lot of them. (Look it up kids)
C’mon, man. If you genuinely want to change people’s minds, the very least you could do is not just repeat all the same wrong talking points everyone has already heard and gone over. Biden has a very long history of defending conservatism &amp; the status quo.
Trump is the President of the United States. Biden currently holds no political office. Sit down, Karen.
Speaking of Biden as a 3rd grader?
This is nowhere near as ambitious as Ronald Reagan’s approach to the ozone or to thermonuclear war. Compare Biden to any pre-Y2K Republican and it gets a lot harder to say “he’s Progressive actually”.
The Biden / Harris ticket is a sign of change for the future of the people and democracy
And all it took was Obama calling in every marker he had to clear the field for Biden in one of the reddest states in the country, mass amounts of voter suppression and weaponize from a plague. Good job. Hope that strategy works in the general.
I do not want Biden
That’s the whole underlying strategy of the Biden campaign and the so-called Never Trumpers.
I’m very curious about the race/class breakdown of those who say “4 more years of DJT might be just the thing we need to truly smash our system” / “Biden is no different and we’ll become complacent again”. Willing to bet many (most?) of those folks are white, upper/middle class.
Trump was made possible by forty years of neoliberalism spearheaded by men like Biden taking their toll on the american people. And it’s Dems who have been complicit in putting Trump’s judges in power. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Another reason to despise Biden.
You mean Dementia Joe and Hunter Biden.
My liberal relatives all think things will be better under Biden. Nothing will convince them otherwise. All have Trump derangement syndrome and all are still falling for the lesser evil nonsense.  I hate to say it, but I really have no hope especially with climate change coming.
Because Joe Biden is beloved by the entire country! #BidenHarris2020
I’m not a Biden supporter. Obv I’m gonna vote for him, but resignedly. I am a you supporter, so that helps.  My top primary choice was  His solutions for immigration are as essential as  for climate. I’m livid neither is speaking at  convention.

The proper honorific would be “President Biden”
Biden may not have Obama's intelligence, but he beats Trump's room-temperature IQ by a wide margin.
Exactly. One minute Biden is a rapist, the next minute you’re his Vice President nominee!
The fact that he is copying a Portlandia joke on day 80 or whatever... YOU WILL EAT THIS CHICKEN AND LIKE IT!!! Only thing that’s missing is a temporary Joe Biden Twitter icon
Great list! All accounted for. ✅💙💪
Maybe you should be demanding better than Joe Biden, then. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
My point is there’s  a difference between his treatment by Biden and Assanges treatment by Trump.  If you don’t think the Secretary of State and VP were always instrumental in his pinning in Russia i have some bad news for you.
You made that choice when you nominated Biden. Now stop shaming Leftists and go convince your Kasich and Bloomberg fans.
Biden isn’t the greater good. Get a goddamn clue.
Joe Biden isn’t the greater good, Jane. At best, he’s an equal evil.
Not weird. Joe Biden has advanced dementia and can’t answer questions.
You are delusional about Biden. His record is to support cuts to Social Security.  If he’s elected he will cut social security like he’s promised for 40 years.  He tried to cut it under Obama too but failed. Deny reality, but you’ll find out.
If you allow a broken bone to heal without first setting it right, the limb is still fucked. A Biden presidency is just that.
Joe Biden has always supported cutting social security, medicare and Medicaid.  Campaign promises are nothing, it’s his record that tells the true story.
I’m not the one who voted for the one guy who would do the worst against him in the general, Jayne. Maybe you should get to work phone banking for Biden. Quick! November is getting close.
I don't know about any of you all out there, but the saddest argument to vote for Biden over Trump is to make politics boring again.  I nearly cry at the sheer relief of that thought.  That's when I realize how much Trump has traumatized us with the constant barrage of filth.

Biden kneecapped we Dems by choosing the most corrupt, useless AG that California ever had.  Both sides are equally horrible.
Yeah because Biden doesn’t HAVE to organize... they are already in power. Leftists absolutely have a mandate of organizing before we can get power.
CENTER-RIGHT DEMOCRATS FTW!  Just remember, folks, earlier this year we were talking about UBI and universal healthcare and the government doing things that would actually help you and your neighbors! Let's see how far that gets under Biden/Harris (not very)
All true.  I think we should vote Trump out and then hold Biden and Harris accountable for legalizing sex work especially on worker safety, fair pay, and other economic grounds. We need to vote.  #Cult45 has laid down the fundamental elements of a 4th Reich. Job #1 destroy him.
Perspective is still important. “Oh wow the VP and Secretary of State were part of delicate diplomatic talks!”   While the current President covers for the murder of journalists.. Maybe I’m coming from the wrong angle but I’m not sure how hard this hurts Biden.

Biden isn’t adopting Bernie’s platform, it seems that you’re the one playing with the checkers, dude.
I keep coming across anecdotes from people whose relative, friend, neighbor, has recently switched from trump to Biden... and I think of these as major turning points in those lives.  More, please, of people finally saying to the psycho trump: Enough!!!!!
This  This is the guy we must elect if we are to save social security? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Biden's gonna win, but he's gonna have a tough time. America needs to (not now) confront the CIA's (primary) role in the "crack cocaine epidemic".  Some old ladies in Pittsburgh and Minneapolis still think it was Black men's fault, not GHWB's. We need to set the record straight.
Spell it out:  Trump caps are made in China, while Biden caps are made in the United States.
Busy first responders who may be not be able to vote in person, seniors likely to vote for Biden frightened to line up and vote in person. Worst open voter suppression since I walked door to door almost 50 years ago for the right to vote at 18.

That is a very scary thought! Also, can you imagine how hellish our current existence would be right now had Hillary won? I shudder at the thought. Now she wants to be a member og a Biden/Harris administration! She's like an evil undying villain in a horror movie.

Lol as you back a guy who has been accused 8 times (Biden), and was told by Harris herself that he was a racist and that his accuser should be believed. Nice deflection though - victims only matter if bloo says so.

And the Democrats have COWARDLY  marched to the RIGHT because they  just ASCENT to most of the suppresion   they don't ACTUALLY Want a VAST POOL of new voters because they KNOW new voters are NOT in love with Biden.
So here is the thing about Biden vs Trump.  In the short term, we might not get arrested under a Biden admin but within a year or two, Biden will be showing its facist head.  So vs Trump being already at the same point.
Biden is a fascist too.  Really the US government both the democrats and republicans have been part of a fascist government since the beginging of time.
Well if someone wants Biden's DNA and he fights it I'll be the first to get on his case....
Hopefully there's a straightforward way to get rid of this DeJoy douchebag if Biden wins and Dems take the Senate. This postal board thing seems like it might be a problem.

would him endorsing biden mean anything? i think it might.
The Republicans will be radicalizing people to the right during Biden because most people will think Biden is left and that is something which Vaush misunderstands and all.
Uhhhhh. President Biden, actually.
Nice, but I think he should have to trade a couple packs of cigarettes before he gets to watch coverage of Biden &amp;  Harris as they receive the Nobel Prize for defeating his corrupt keister.
I’m confused on that viral Kamala/Biden moment. She’s pro bussing? 🙃
Yes. Biden and Harris are pretty yikes but Trump is even more yikes.
Seeing the news about the NY police union endorsing Trump made me remember that the International Association of Fire Fighters has endorsed Biden.  Once again we get to see who is on the side of the community.
Joe Biden is embarrassing to even watch.
How dare you imply that we aren't doing enough by voting for Joe Biden. How dare you imply any existence of weakness within the democratic party. Jed Bartlet is turning in his grave, sir.
Joe Biden:  "wowee zowee, will you look at that! It's looneytunes!"  Elizabeth Warren: "I demand the Inspector General of the post office investigate DeJoy"  IG of the PO : "ok, I'm investigating"  One person here actually gets shit done. And sadly it's not our Pres nominee .
That’s my observation as well.  Though must I sadly report the first Biden sign in my neighborhood appeared in the last couple weeks.  There seems to (rightly) be zero enthusiasm for the guy. Seen several BLM and anti-Trump signs though.
So are you, why aren't you phonebanking for Biden right now? Every call you don't make for Biden is a call for Trump
I know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I’m thinking that you can’t help if you are at Gitmo, can you?

Ok so we can agree via transcript he totally condemned white supremacists, check, we have the shithole countries comment from "sources", cool, and then we literally watch cities burn on tv for months but biden said "hey man, dont do that" (probably doesnt remember though).

Thank you, I think you’re very thoughtful as well. I’d like to be able to influence more non-voters toward voting for Biden / unseating Trump. I have to believe at least somewhat in what I’m saying though. I think Tlaib’s approach is a good one.
Biden’s digital team are some of the best in the business, I just cant comprehend “hire comedians to write your emails”
If Clinton showed anything it’s that promising M4A doesn’t mean you have to actually do it; it costs almost nothing to merely point out the flaws in the health insurance system. That Biden won’t even pretend he’s interested in fixing health care during a pandemic is disappointing
It took audacity for Biden to choose Harris? “The essence of audacity is having the bravery to do something that could offend others. Because of this, the word has both positive (bravery, bold) and negative (rude, impudent, disrespectful) connotations.” Go Joe! #BidenHarris2020
This is true. Which is why we have to take a hard stand. If Trump losing is more important to the Democrats than Biden winning then they can come over to our side. We tried supporting their side and it got us and them nowhere.
What will move me is Biden or his reps publicly acknowledging and apologizing for past mistakes, and communicating their new position on those issues. It’s worked well enough on Harris in the past.
Why would we expect Joe fucking Biden to roll back the clock on American fascism when he already had the goddamn opportunity with a more progressive partner than Kamala Harris.
P.s. I'm voting Down ticket  blue but am not likely voting for Biden. I don't have a dog in this fight.  But I know Soccer moms better than trump.
BTW My $5 bet says Suburbanite Soccer moms Break in the direction of Biden simply because they're concerned the  white house is xenophobic homophobic racist and a number of other forms of bigotry they'd rather not be taught to their kids.
And what did the white house do? Instead of disassembling it and putting the 90s government back together, they sent in Joe fucking Biden, who cut costs then called it a victory.
Then ask it of EVERY politician and start with Joe Biden.
It IS facing something new. I don't recall Joe Biden installing a crony corrupt postmaster general to slow down the USPS, cut overtime, sack the exec board, and scrap mail sorting machines. Each machine costs $1+ mil, so hardly a cost saving measure, ridiculous as that reason is.
The suburbanite housewife is more worried about the lessons the xenophobic clown in the white house is sending to her kids,  I know soccer moms better than trump does.  she's probably voting Biden. I don't have a problem with her. I'm actually shocked as a pretty left wing punk
The ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY got filthy rich shamelessly using Joe's political connections. Americans are fed up.
“The ‘suburban housewife’ will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge!”
Unfortunately, you’re right. There are people who can say something to sway me, but those people are Biden and Harris. I’ll be watching the debates closely, plus any press release their campaign puts out. I honestly want an excuse to be bad at leftism and vote “blue” again.
“Her agenda might not sound sufficiently ambitious in Northern California but it could very easily play differently in Michigan and Wisconsin,” Schnur said, naming two swing states narrowly clinched by Trump in 2016 but that Biden now leads in the polls.
During her unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris attacked Biden for failing to support an overhaul of the nation’s health care system, but he slammed her for attempting to “have it every which way.” With Biden at the top of the ticket, Harris will have to move from
Harris said she was proud to join Biden and blamed Trump for mismanaging the coronavirus and the economy.  “We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be,” she said. “Joe likes to say that character is on the ballot.
If you're not chomping at the bit to vote for Biden/Harris, I don't think there's much I can say to sway you. I understand the down-ballot arg, but it pales, in my mind, in the face of this fundamental threat. ymmv
On Wednesday, Biden formally introduced Harris as his running mate in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, praising her for going after the gun lobby and oil industry and saying he wanted her “to be the last voice in the room” when he makes his toughest decisions.
Almost immediately after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his pick for vice president, the Trump campaign and his acolytes began casting the California senator as a “far-left radical” set on transforming the U.S. into a socialist’s dream
So that gives Biden/Harris even less time than they already have to communicate a platform I’d be able to vote for. Yet another super gross and manipulative move by Trump and his goons.
worry less about biden and more about me I am the extremist and  I am prepared to vote my values for the first time.
as a Radical leftist I renounce Biden and Harris. #politics #political #Republicans
I have no problem being made into the Democrats Armor  in that  respect. Biden isn't one of us Radical leftist.
Tom Werner Tom Werner They are okay with your opinion. In fact, they are counting on you being mad at this ticket. You are vouching that Biden/Harris arent "radical leftists"      Like      · Reply · 6h
People, if you don’t Know right now who you are voting for: 1- your an idiot, 2- you haven’t been paying attention. Get your ballet mailed as soon as you receive it.  Don’t delay. It is easy. Biden/Harris. Just do it.  ,
DOCTOR CLAUD? -  has found a Black academic (Blackademic?),  who has ideas on how to move Black U.S. citizens forward, but who is he?
I will drive my living body through a rusty pike over a pit of hungry carnivores in order to vote for the Biden Harris ticket.
Rose Twitter rabid anti-Biden/Kamala is a “when they show you who they are believe them” moment.  Nobody thinks Biden is the messiah, fershitsakes!  But vote your own self interest!
New York has a problem.  How can any sane adult -- much less an entire union -- endorse this monster?
History will also remember the number of times Biden tried to cut Social Security. Know your candidate.
Go, Evil Me....GO!

Biden promised to cure cancer to a crowded room. He told another that "not a single solitary scientist think Bernies plan will work". If you think Biden plans on following through on his climate change plan then let me tell you about how he's going to cure cancer in 4 years.
4th rate editing job.  Wasted a minute of my time and I'm not voting for Biden.
Congratulations, I'm so excited &amp; happy about your running as Vice President. I believe Joe Biden is one of the most honest people in Washington. Also, I believe that he is surrounding himself with capable, educated, &amp; honest individuals. All the Best, Deb Churchill
When I heard that masking comment from Biden, my first thought was...control over the people and here we go again.  Sick bastards.
Vote for Biden and talk to all of your reformed (almost) MAGA people. We must blow Trumpkut of the water in November. Live you
If you live in Washington state and vote for Biden, you're not participating in "harm reduction", you're just endorsing his right wing policies.
If true Biden wins in a walk, even with rigging. When non-Republicans and non-conservatives vote good things will flow.
Yes, we all have to vote for Biden this time around because we are held hostage. It doesn’t mean we have to be happy about it, or ignore that other things need to be done to fix it so we’re not held hostage next time. Don’t be so single minded you’re willing to ignore the future
I feel like I have no meaningful way to express my  real values in our political process...  It's not me throwing a fit because my guy didn't win it's realizing me and Biden are worlds apart. #politics #political  #democrat #democrats #liberal #liberals and just being unwilling
Great interview. I especially appreciate his answers to questions about how a Biden presidency will help Wisconsin.
We do. I just hope Biden won’t take us down ‘Ford road’. We can’t afford that.
Don't talk to cops... Or our worthless lying mayor. Maybe stick around at a protest long enough to get gassed next time, and not just show up for the Instagram selfies. The only students that still like you at the end of the year are the proud boys &amp; Biden lovers.
I still have a hard time imagining the military would officially back a Trump coup, if only because he's been consistently personally shitty to them and Biden is a conventional warmonger. There are benefits to the status quo.  That doesn't mean the rank and file would follow tho.
If you're genuinely so terrified of trump blame yourselves for voting biden in.
I can't stand her based on all the seriously fk'd stuff she has done over the years in California but this meme made me have a good chuckle.  I guess my issues with her are similar to why I can't stand Biden due to all the crap he did while a Senator in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Why aren’t the Mountain Goats writing Biden’s car commercials?
Postal union endorses Biden candidacy as 'survival' of USPS at stake.
Sept. 1 I'll be on leave. Back on Nov. 5th. to congratulate Joe Biden.

Biden pointing out USPS is picking up mailboxes in Oregon
to fucking switch  your Vote from Biden to Bernie.... #howiehawkins2020
That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
Russians are creating fake ANTIFA web pages and linking them to Joe Biden 2020; Trump is openly trying to suppress voting; 1 out of 4 tests in Texas are positive thanks to GOP leadership; on and on—and this is on you GOPranos. You are enemies of democracy.
You 👏🏻 need 👏🏻 to 👏🏻 vote 👏🏻 Biden 👏🏻👏🏻
Stop screwing up the Post Office. My neighbor didn't receive her medications on time &amp; she had a stroke. This has got to stop! You are hurting your voters. For my neighbor's husband; he is now voting for Biden. This will have huge backlash against you. Fire DeJoy now! Resign now.
National organized labor works for the DNC. You think Perez/Biden/Pelosi want a general strike? No, they don’t. It has to come from the bottom up. Pick a walk-out date and spread that shit like wildfire and we’ll see what happens. Waiting for leaders is what losers do.
Bill Clinton didn’t really deliver on that, but he promised to try. Biden promises *not* to try. It’s frankly ridiculous that people keep trying to paint Biden as an FDR-like progressive when only Sanders’ platform was even close.
Yes, progressives are well aware of the back to brunch crowd, and that's one of the biggest dangers of a Biden presidency, people who hear Democrats say shit like this and don't push back.
Biden should base his campaign around being a wife guy
If China hacks Trump and sends advance notification of when the releases will be so that Biden can plan his strategy around them and he doesn't tell the DOJ so they can investigate the cyber-attack, then yes, that would be corrupt of Biden.
I said some very similar things when I took an Instagram survey for Biden. Hopefully this sort of thing gets the message through to them, that they fucked up if they wanted the progressive vote.
?  Biden would have won comfortably.
*Suppression of the vote  *Incitement of the virus  *Disenfranchisement of poor people and people of color  *Destruction of the environment and bullying a minor (Greta Thunberg) *Promoter of Qanon conspiracy theories   Biden/Harris  for Truth
Joe Biden is racist and picked his vp running mate solely on her race. Again, he is showing the world he is racist.
This is an election of apathy. People are voting for Biden, because they have to, with little to no enthusiasm. This will not fare well with undecided voters. I'm walking away from Democrats this time. I haven't decided to vote for Trump. But, I won't vote for Biden.
He'll leave when Joe Biden assumes office and orders a company of the 82nd Airborne in to take him out at gunpoint with handcuffs on!
society as we know it, you just get a possible chance to avert that eventuality in 4 years, instead of 12 with Trump rather than Biden / Harris.
So happy 4  right now - can’t wait for  to fire up this fall “Joe Biden had the audacity to choose a black woman to be his running mate - and ya know who that black woman is - itttt’s meeeeee” that was a Kamala open w/ an Oprah slide at the end.
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. We have such a short time for action on climate change before passing the point of no return.
Count me as one who will settle for Biden.
I don’t think you need to shame them as much as explain that as flawed as Biden is, a vote for him is a vote against our actually fascist current president. (And everything Ian said.)
I was following this account... I don't follow liars.  Immediate #Unfollow
Barr should investigate Biden for creating the Wuhan virus. CNN reported Ukraine was involved. The only way to keep America great again is to make it great the first time around, reelect POTUS. #MAGA #KAGA #presidentialharrassment
uh? Joe Biden spend decades trying to defund social security.
Just like those pics conservatives are passing around with Biden consoling his grandkids at their father's funeral, and saying he's a predator?
That is why he picked  .  They are a perfect fit &amp; compliment each other.  BTW you are right behind Biden in age.  Look what you have done to our country.
We need a government that not only "listens to", but actually ACTS on science. We cannot afford to NOT have the #GreenNewDeal  Wake up Biden!
Very true, though which candidate will lead to more profitable profits is  something they very much consider.  I would expect Biden makes a good case for long game- definitely more stable than Great Orange Leader.  Stability is attractive to the insurance industry, generally.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
Send her to Shady Oaks man ... the woman is done ... all these old Dems are senile as all get out ... Schumer, Pelosi, Biden - and Schiff is just an idiot - they all think we’re stupid.  Vote for them at your own risk !
How do you know?  Obama didn’t immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
So you got to keep more of your money and you’re whining about it?  Biden said he’s eliminating the Trump cuts and will raise taxes.
The left is going to be blamed regardless if Biden loses, just accept that now, that's what is going to happen, no amount of comity or ass kissing is going to change that.  There is however a lot of leverage in saying we could have won if these voters wanted to vote for us.
Than there is in rubber stamping a right wing Biden administration.   You're just both saying a lot of demonstrably untrue fabricated bullshit that is easily debunked with some cursory research.
Let’s compare your intellect to Biden’s. First u had someone take your SAT’s, then u can barely read, often your lights are on but nobody’s home. Top psychiatrists collectively say you are a danger to yourself &amp; others. You just had a cognitive test, so do u know what this is?
Not everything that's corrupt is criminal. If Biden had done what he's accused of re: Hunter &amp; Burisma (he didn't, but still) it wouldn't have been a crime. Removing a corrupt prosecutor was in America / the West's interests.
You and jo biden need to go away.
Opinion | How Jennifer O’Malley Dillon transformed Joe Biden’s campaign Opinion by Karen Tumulty
Reason 9,000,000 I’m all I’m with Biden/Harris
Voting for Biden/Harris is jumping on the fast train to Socialism. Affordable  healthcare &amp; college for all means higher taxes for the working people. Nothing is free &amp; I know who will pay. I will be working &amp; getting less while someone else does less &amp; getting more.  #TRUMP2020
Not sure what the problem is... Chris Wallace won’t actually ask Biden a tough question
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. Trump is doing worse than nothing. He is rolling back regulations.
After Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office, we certainly will.
Lyin Biden is running on a "i am not Trump" platform no policies included....
Team Biden will.
There is no way Biden is winning short of a rigged electing.
They're only voting for Biden because they're basically comfortable...
Should the federal government require everyone to wear masks like Joe Biden wants?
He’s clearly talking about Biden. Hannity even quotes Biden a few times in that video lol poor attempt from the left
99.9 percent... The only Biden flag I've seen also had an American flag??? Head scratcher lol
Biden mostly seems to be unafraid to touch young women...
He doesn't, we just get to try again sooner than we do under Biden and Harris.
Good.  All the more reason I will be walking over broken glass if need be to vote for Biden and Harris.
VP: "Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!"  Insert any one of a dozen jokes here that are totally obvious, probably juvenile, and yet still completely on point because…Pence.
Herman Cain's zombie Twitter account doesn't count.
NO, I am writing in Tulsi Gabbard. The DNC is corrupt and when you lose in November don't blame it on the voters, blame it on the corrupt people that control you and Biden. #NeverBidenNeverKamala #IStandWithTulsi #TulsiExposedKamala #TulsiGabbard
CNN should mention that time in 2010 when Joe Biden spoke at a Klansman’s funeral and called him a mentor and friend.
your "a new poll reinforces" is incorrect, I think- shouldn't Trump's be worse, not better? "Biden is viewed more positively than Clinton was, and Trump is viewed more positively than he was"
From the conclusion of your article.  "But Biden’s comments over time make clear that he has at least been willing to keep cuts to Social Security and Medicare as negotiating chips"
There is video of Biden proposing cuts to social security on the floor of the senate, for fucks sake.  You Blue MAGA people are just as bad as Trump, all fake news all the time, when it looks bad for your favs.  Just utterly useless Americans.
Kamala is much worse than Hillary in every aspect which is why the Biden campaign is looking like a big dummy.
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
It's disgusting how Biden shamelessly used his political connections to make himself and his entire family filthy rich.
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
As I said, I would be just fine with Trump hiring someone to speak with Ukrainians who had stories about hypothetical Biden corruption, sure.  The problem is that in this case, the "corruption" is being completely invented from whole cloth.
I didn't read that story before linking it, but if you are asserting that Obama did not try to cut social security, or that Biden has not tried to cut social security, you are lying.  Full stop.
Primary elections were held with in-person voting during a pandemic. Biden was given free corporate media coverage. Other candidates dropped out to endorse Biden just as other options had a chance. The voters did not choose Biden.
Nor will it change under Biden.
?  Trump literally can't run for two more terms, this is basic constitutional law.  And there will be no primary in 2024 if Biden wins, people pretending otherwise are lying to themselves.
Are you fact checking Biden also?🤷‍♀️
Sanders is one of the few decent people in politics, Biden and Harris certainly aren't.
If Joe Biden had corrupt business deals in Ukraine, I would be OK with Trump paying people to go talk to his business partners to learn about them, yes.   How do you not see the difference between a hostile gov't funded endeavor and private citizens?
I like Beto but come on dude! He shouldn't have endorsed Biden pre Super Tuesday, we knew they wouldn't help TX.
trump has been a hundred times more disrespectful to Biden than Harris could ever dream of being. Her calling Biden on bussing made perfect sense and I think showed him how tough and unafraid she is, which impressed him because he, unlike trump, respects women.
I will believe Biden has moved left when there is policy passed, and not a moment before.   And Favs knows that too, he just doesn't have a high opinion of his listeners intelligence.
They know since Biden’s the D ticket, their boats gonna float fine no matter who wins. Nothing special in it for any investment of time or $$
I think Vaush is realizing he is on the wrong side of the history here and is double downing on his points that Biden is the best way forward when he is obviously not.
Poll: Biden Expands Lead Over Trump; A Third Of Country Says It Won't Get Vaccinated, via
Biden said "Shoot them in the leg." The difference between that and "throw them in a van" isn't meaningfully different to those protesting police corruption.
Brinkmanship is, unfortunately, the best way I can see to advance it in 2020. I want Biden to worry about losing, not feel like he can coast on “blue no matter who” loyalists pushing everyone to give up.
Where’s Rudy G? Hiding till October to pop Hunter Biden crazy shit.

Biden is more conservative than Eisenhower. You are saying we need to vote for him anyways. That is conservative apologia.

This is fascinating! One thing that rankles me a/b Biden is that his style only works for and among good ole (white) boys. I love that Obama and Hillary bonded over the way the rest of us have to approach work. ♥️
I get exactly what I deserve when I’m forced to watch Biden ads whilst viewing fishing videos on YouTube
I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. I've been making this same argument all month now but I always get the same "But Biden isn't great!". Never an answer about how letting Trump win will make things easier. They just ignore it. I hate to call people Russian bots but..
None of this is fair.  1. The interview question implies that Harris didn't like Biden. Which isn't at all what she said at the time.  2. Now she's accused of lying and not taking politics seriously. Which is obviously wrong.  "You could have done better" is critique. Not hatred.
We definitely don't have enough time for the long game of electing Biden and Harris to run the party for the next 12 years that people in this thread are advocating for.
My Mom is a Biden supporter. Myself, I aligned more with Warren/Sanders.  Whenever we talked about the election during the Primary, we knew we were voting for WHOEVER ended up running against Trump.  It's Biden and I'm voting for Biden/Harris.   It's that simple. #NeverTrump
Both didn't win the primary. Biden got in there via coup and Harris was roundly rejected.  It's amazing, how 45% of the DEM electorate doesn't appear to matter at all and sabotaging our democratic process is just fine when convenient.
Biden/Harris platform. Needs more student loan forgiveness for public servants, but also for everyone, especially first generation scholars.
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don’t need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
1. Obtained a Chinese name. 2 agreed with Biden accusers. 3. Bankrupted her own pres. Campaign.
Please keep BIDEN and all the other walking corpse predators TF away from her.  Keep at least a two corpse, head to feet of course, distance from anyone of them at any time and this 18 year woman.
Good for you.  The 25% Biden difference is unaffected as my parents are Republicans voting for Biden.
Another item on the long list of reforms needed in the Biden/Harris era. We’ve done this before and can do it again (progressive era, New Deal, post-Watergate, Church cmte, etc).
Judge Kenneth K. Lee Appointed byDonald Trump  Consuelo M. Callahan: Appointed by George W. Bush  Barbara M. G. Lynn (Voted against): Appointed by Bill Clinton  Republicans focusing on appointing judges for the last 4 years has worked. Dems better do the same if Biden wins.
Most of We the People will be voting for Joe Biden, we're tired of having a crook in the WH.
Vote Biden then call him out on his shit

I have all sorts of issues with Biden, but it’s a little rich to hear critiques like this from the party of white supremacists
do you seriously think that people who voted against Hillary aren't going to vote against Biden too? I think Dems assume a way more shallow stupidity in Trump voters than is generally true. Most of them (in error, IMO, but sincerely) were voting against the broad establishment
You do realize identity theft is profitable and that voter fraud is not, don't you?  What's more likely, the people buying these IDs are running up debts .... or they are trying to vote twice because they're REALLY BIG Biden supporters?
When did politicians stop caring about rumor and innuendo??  It’s almost as if the  has just been suckering people in for 20 years with the goal of going balls to the walls now to usurp complete power. Even after Biden is in there’ll be a hellu cleanup on aisle 9. F’sheesh
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every “Trump” to “Biden” and every “Biden” to “Trump”.
Absolutely no one who voted for Trump is going to vote for Biden instead
But if we can vote in Biden he'll be able to turn that around, right? All the more reason to vote for the man.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.

What incentive does Biden have to back progressive policy? He has already rejected the baseline issue for us, #MedicareForAll
Pence can't pardon trump for crimes not already been indicted for and hasn't been tried for , there's a big list and it will stick .  Pence won't be anything in January , Biden will be president .
I’m starting to think ‘Bernie or Bust’ is just as ridiculous of a position as ‘Ridin’ with Biden’. Instead of placing all your hopes on one politician, you *could* examine our political system as a whole and realize it doesn’t matter who you vote for.  The electoral process..
Biden is a glass of milk. Not your first choice, but not too bad.  Trump is a glass of sewer water, bugs, and coronavirus.   The choice is YOURS.  #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
Citizens United isn’t abstract. It is concrete. Conservative Justices sided with the argument that limitless money in campaigns is free speech. Democrats want to legislate campaign finance reform &amp; Republican senate is blocking it. Want change? Vote for Biden
I will vote to elect you and Biden , and if trump became president and I lose my social security , I will fight him .
Imagine calling yourself a leftist while you bend yourself into a pretzel for Joe Biden of all people

lies every time she opens her mouth.  She is more Trump than Trump.  There is NO ONE left to vote for!  Harris and Trump are both evil, corrupt liars.  What can we do?
Biden helped write the legislation that primarily caused this system to be as fucked up as it is. I honestly don't think he would be any better or worse than Trump. If we actually want change we have to work outside of this two party corruption feedback loop
I have theory, Kamala Harris was told to drop out early to keep her from sustaining any more collateral damage during the debates,they had her as the VP pick at that point,then got Bernie out, Biden would be easy to remove giving Kamala the Presidency at some point

The new Biden/Harris campaign ad shows Joe down on one knee. Apparently Commie'la is a great teacher. Joe looks ready to perform orally.
If Biden gets the vote of postal workers, that’s gonna be clutch.

Biden is up 25%
At 77, Biden still rides a bicycle for exercise &amp; keeps his weight down There's no dementia there but Trump is morbidly obese &amp; can barely walk his fat behind down a ramp &amp; can't put together a coherent sentence so guess where the dementia is.

"regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden"
Twitter is an open forum, you post things, people get to reply.   Attacking people who are clearly vastly morally superior to the Democratic party, regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden is bad form, and bad for the Overton Window.
THE ONLY TIME I will let someone vaccinate me is when I see an F.D.A. approval on the vaccine &amp; when Joe Biden is in office. FULL STOP!
Still behind in my mind.  Biden will be behind until January when he takes the oath as far as I'm concerned.
the VERY Drug warriors I've been railing against for YEARS. and now I'm just supposed to I don't know abandon everything I've ever written about and vote Biden. I stand by it all. Ergo. Howie.
Wow, you mean they’re real people? Flawed and capable of short comings? Good lord what’s the world coming to? Fascinating read. And really stoked confidence in a potential Biden administration frankly. But ya, the Obama/Biden memes weren’t real life, oh well.
It's disgusting how Biden and his entire family got filthy rich by shamelessly using his political connections.

..as though the only defining characteristic of blackness is how “POCs” are treated by the police. I personally have no issue in voting for Biden/Harris because I understand politics. What I do have issues with is the erasure of blackness as a defined people with a defined cause.
They have a full schedule. He’s just a guest. Monday: hate on Susan Sarandon Tuesday: racism against Briahna Gray Wednesday: more racism Nina Turner Thursday: Scold leftists for not being excited about Biden Friday: Guest Spot  Everyday: Bernie fucking Sanders.
You can't be in America you must mean duh trump that is destroying America and great minds like biden's are not talkers they do things for our country trump only destroys so he can win plus he cheats and lies on all things
Maybe not, particularly with Biden/Harris. But Dems usually benefit from higher voter turnout (why GOP works so hard to supress votes) and who knows how many of those people were victims of The New Jim Crow
All the more reason to vote for Biden/Harris.
The thing I’m most looking forward to about the Biden Harris presidency is not being outraged constantly
But y'all were so ready to called #Harris a non-Black radical leftist fascist cop, and #Biden a sleepwalking dementia addled dithering r****t.
My wife just got notified her "good" employee sponsored insurance plan is leaving her with a $1024 bill for going to the emergency room for, long story, but basically a 2 minute visit.  F*ck Mainstream Media, F*ck Biden, F*ck Kamala, F*ck Trump &amp; F*ck the DNC
Not a peep from leftists and our mailboxes being taken out; but plenty of sh*t to say about Biden and Harris.
Trump's answer to that question is hell no he doesn't regret lying or cheating on his wife his taxes the election or Americans he's such a scumbag  can't wait till Biden and Harris win this election trump trust cheating always that's what crimminals do
Biden will drop out before or shortly after the midterms in 2022 and there will be no primary in 2024.  The Democratic party does not support primaries of incumbent Presidents, and even if there were, the last two elections should show you how hard taking down Harris will be.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
It's for these reasons That I can't bear to continue down this road and continue to vote against my own values. Biden doesn't speak for me and when I told him don't put her up he didn't even reply.
Oh, and the Biden campaign was lying about CDC recommendations until early April, it would be great if we had a candidate that actually gave a shit about science, but we don't.
We got PLAYED! Joe Biden policies are that of the same as Trump! #VoteThemOut!
Both of these men are over 70.  Let's say, heaven forbid, Biden passed away in his first term.  Harris could finish his term as POTUS and run for two more. Incumbents are historically hard to beat. In theory, Harris could be POTUS over a decade.
Biden's "plans" are sheepherding bullshit and worth less than the electrons used to transmit them.  He probably can't even speak extemporaneously about them.
that moment in history.   We likely get someone like AOC in 2024 with Trump still in office, with a Biden Harris win we know we are getting Harris in 2024, and in 2028 assuming she wins 2024.
Also, read that article, Biden isn't in fact promising to go back to that approach, that was sarcasm, he is saying he won't get rid of the sanctions that violated our side of the terms in the Iranian deal, ie: he plans to continue Trump era foreign policy towards Iran.
I don’t think Amy threw her support behind Biden picking a WOC for pats on the head.
Joe Biden also sucks shit,so no
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
If Biden gets elected quarantine is legally over for 48 hours. Catch me in a sleeping bag at Bar Bar
i'm sure you've been ratio'd on this but you mean the cages biden and obama built and the scotus that biden personally enabled while humiliating anita hill?  you all let the left go in 2016 as well.
Trump is looking for any excuse not to debate Biden, so....... perhaps not the best negotiating device. Trump knows how poorly he'll do; how stupid he comes across (cuz he IS).
Good thing Biden is going back to that approach to Iran.
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Stamp of approval:
I’ll take this another step: Leftists shouldn’t see Biden’s victory as a ‘good thing’ for our movement.  He and Trump both have already wrought havoc on society, oppressing and attacking anyone who refuses to bend to the will of the State.  At this point, electoralism is dead..
Idk who need to hear this bu Biden isn't going to follow through on his climate change plan.. Joe Biden is the same candidate that promised to cure cancer if he was elected but said Sander's (not so radical) plan to address climate change wouldn't ever work.
And we already know that Biden supports regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry and the oil industry alone, and that he has no intentions of doing anything about fracking.
"that’s a whole lot of accelerated global warming tracing right back to America’s front door."  Now there's perhaps a debate to be had about whether or not this was intentional, and purely on the optics Biden and Obama were and are superior.  But all that really matters is tons

Win again and it’s because the silent majority that actually do their research and realize what’s going on instead of thinking orange man bad all the time. Im so over it and if I lose friends because of it I actually don’t care anymore because Biden is the biggest jokeof all time
And if you’re going to say Trump can’t form sentences and you’re supporting Biden that’s such a joke. Among the many racist things Biden has said he also (with Bill Clinton) authored a crime law that devastated black communities. Vote for who you want but Biden is a joke
Maria Bartiromo joins Lester Holt as great interrogators who just let the guy talk as he spills the beans on himself.  Doubtful anything comes of this admission until late Jan 2021 if Biden wins.
Obama originally campaigned on marriage being between a man and a woman. Public opinion shifted and his policies with it. I expect the same will be true if Biden. We’ve already seen lots of shift in proposed climate policies because the center has moved

Your disdain is noted. Biden won the primary fair and square. While I supported (and texted) for Warren, I accept that this is where the majority of the people are at. To change that we have to reach out to them. Do you agree?
2 face much? Still believe the Biden accusers wench!! What a POS!!
Yeah but they need to force it. He says stupid s*** like Biden hates police. They need to say “give an example” every time he makes these broad statements without merit.
Baloney bunch of assumptions he’s gone through to justify what he appears to think will be disqualification of a candidate. He is a fool if he thinks none of those things were reviewed in her application for the presidential candidacy, nor vetted by Biden. 1/

#Black #womanchallenge  Joe Biden. What is a hashtag. I do not know what year is current.
My point was never that Trump is better than Biden. I simply don’t like getting vote shamed and called privileged for having well-researched political and moral objections to voting for a guy who has contributed a great deal to why we are in the situation we are in.
Biden will weaken the progressive movement because establishment Dems like Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, etc. are the ones pushing harder than anyone to quell opposition to the status quo. Biden himself admitted nothing will fundamentally change for the ruling class. Progress undone.
The same people that argue that Pence is potentially worse than Trump “because he’s principled” are now in full support of Biden, a principled hardline conservative
I respect that you aren’t trying to sell Biden as a good candidate. He simply isn’t. However, I think that rather than blaming voters for not being compelled to vote for someone that doesn’t espouse any policies they support, we should instead address why that’s the case at all
80% of Black Americans think Trump is a racist. Today Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his VP. You are as out of touch as Trump. Please tell us more about your QAnon beliefs Jo Rae? Your campaign is DOA. More nutters for Trump.
Not trying to be rude, but how will Biden be functionally different? On paper, he opposes virtually all legislation that actually alleviates our conditions. A call for the return to Obama-era politics ignores the fact that those politics directly led to Trump in the first place
TYT Reacts to Joe Biden's VP Pick, Kamala Harris  via
One reply was that she had registered and was excited to vote Biden/Harris!
If Biden wins, he will inevitably resign approximately halfway through his term, and Harris will lose the next election to a fascist worse than Trump because she was chosen solely on optics and will have no political mandate. Apparently Democrats are asking for that, though.
When I turned on FOX SPEWS (news) they had a clip of Tulsi Gabbard &amp; Kamala Harris going at it during a debate.  I guess they don’t have a clue as to what a historic moment this is with Biden picking Harris.
I’m not a Democrat but I’m voting for Biden. Happy to follow you.
I’m fine with that switch, I might not even notice - Joe Biden, Pete Butidedge(I know), as long as Kamala Harris is there, I’m good.
If you think Trump is anything that resembles a human being or a person of God , then hell is a place you will be placed! How dare you say Biden is not a Catholic! He is a good man and a good Catholic! Flawed yes but a damn sight better than that disgusting human waste in the WH!

Joe Biden selects his running mate, with announcement coming as early as today.
More useful: current positions.   Trump ordered deferred payroll taxes that fund social security &amp; Medicare.       Biden’s current platform.
And shouldn’t a man of faith be honest? Biden is clearly mentally challenged. You can see it by comparing his speeches from a few years ago. Compassion would get the man help not use him as a prop.
I’m curious about what you did to make that happen, contact Biden or Symone Sanders?  I think you would have been a good person to include, as well as Julian Castro &amp; Beto O’Rourke.
The ACA was so hated by the GOP they renamed it #Obamacare and then it became popular. THAT'S how we got protection from being denied insurance or bilked for extra money because of pre-existing conditions. Biden will make it even better.  #DemCast #ONEV1 #BlueDot

1. He’s right.  2. Where was Eric when the NYT was trashing our best chance to beat Trump and slurring Tara Reade?  Eric has helped to prop up the Biden/Harris kamikaze ticket by trashing the alternative too.
I'm thinking that the REAL reason Trump hates voting by mail is that it diffuses any October surprise. With people voting weeks before the election, there's no opportunity to blast some lie (TBD) that he hopes would draw votes from Biden.

That’s the whole underlying strategy of the Biden campaign and the so-called Never Trumpers.

You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
You hate women! You’re threatened by smart women!
What do you have to say to your dad about this deplorable comment about women? We know how little he thinks of you
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He’s one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? 🤔
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I’m Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I’m voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
Brutal caricature of Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. Very funny!
It’s time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I’m reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say “I’d run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden” but I’m not seeing y’all actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where’s that devotion? 🤔
I’m voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I’ve seen and heard put forth.  They’re gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.
is a fucking liar, referring to him not knowing about Kanye Wests intention of stealing Biden votes.   They cooked this shit up and it will backfire on the  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteByMail2020
Are you sure she didn't mean Trump? Is she predicting violence against Biden?
The parts Biden wrote into law?
I still say John Kasich shouldn’t be there at all. There’s no legitimate reason. The #NeverTrump crowd practically nominated Biden.  Why does the strongest candidate to beat Trump need Kasich? 🤔
Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the “far left, socialist Democrats.” This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
CNN firmly in Biden camp
Nice to know!! Biden can’t tell the difference between the toilet or a shower. Let that sink in! No worries, Biden can’t find the sink so you’re safe.😂🤪
Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
4️⃣0️⃣% of home health workers are on SNAP or Medicaid while providing essential care during a pandemic. We need to  #ProtectEssentialWorkers by paying them fairly, and providing COVID-19 protections like PPE, sick leave and workers' compensation.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I’m not disaffiliated.  I’m very much a conservative which is why I don’t like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won’t complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers—I don’t recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.
Sorry, I tend to do that to Biden Bros.
I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
I’m voting for Biden, but there is no way this is accurate.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
You’re completely incapable of attacking Biden on issues so you have to resort to childish taunts. Sad
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

It's Kamala: Biden Picks Harris as Running Mate -
In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won’t make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you’re hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it’s a small number, I doubt it’s negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That’s not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can’t do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I’d consider volunteering for them but it’s Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
Moderately.  She’s very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the “adult” and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he’s saying it was a poor choice from Biden’s perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I’m more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might’ve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She’s like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.

Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I’m really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It’s a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.Trump lies about voting by mail because he doesn’t want us to vote or he doesn’t want our votes to be counted. He won’t correct his statements and he won’t shut up about his lies.    Let’s just vote until he’s buried in votes for Biden. Vote early. #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Get yourself ready to primary Biden in 2024, you can do it

This 100%. The left is gonna take a dirt nap under Biden.

We just recently installed cable for my son, and I'm watching my first Trump "press briefing". Three minutes in, he's already attacking Biden. On the US taxpayer's dime.
Biden has been in office so many years he has cultivated friendships with many of the generals in our military. That's why I'm not too concerned if Trump tries a coup.
He already took America lower than its ever been. Biden/ Harris are the only way to get back. Pull your head out of your ass and look around you
Actually I'd say the destruction started in the 90s with Clinton but Joe Biden losing will seal its fate.
I am hearing you and what I’m hearing if that “criticism of Harris is not allowed.” She has flipped on several important issues, we should find I’m out if she has done so on climate change.   Biden does not support the Green New Deal. This is important.
Biden’s campaign has sent me two bumper stickers for free and I threw them both in the recycling bin.   I hope he doesn’t send a Biden/Harris one as that would just be even more waste of his campaign money (it would also go in the recycling bin)
Chris, when you try to silence criticism of Kamala Harris’s controversial record you are demoralizing voters who are apathetic about Biden/Harris.   Please be more conscious of the fact the voters Biden needs to sway are the ones who feel the most hesitancy about him and Harris
1. Even if he did win a 2nd term he can’t run for re-election cause of the 22nd amendment   2. Also yes. Since he’ll lose he will refuse to leave kinda just like Ronald and Nancy Reagan did but only now they’ll have to call the swat team on trump just like what Biden said
Only if the Socialist win, which isn’t likely with the un-Black Kamala in the race because we all know Biden will take a bye after 3 months.
EVERY CANDIDATE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SOUND BITE NATURE OF DEBATES. Yang, Sanders, Booker, Warren, Biden, Harris, Gabbard, Swalwell, Bloomberg and, yes, Buttigieg.

conservatives democrats always made the same promises biden does. 'business as usual' is not going to fix the over reach that just happenned. If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!

its always serious when its poor people, she said she wasnt to use the fbi to clean up our communities. What has she said shed do to stop the fbi from picking the president? What will biden do to stop that?

And Biden/ the DNC haven't? One wrong doesn't negate another.   If I murder 1 or 5 people, I'm still a murderer. I don't understand how you #BlueMAGA people can support any of it. So gross.
FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.

They each had enough confidence to tell Biden’s VP vetting team directly that they thought it was Harris’s campaign. Amazing.

“Biden advisers asked about contributions she received as state attorney general from Steven Mnuchin, who at the time was running a bank, OneWest, that was accused of violating foreclosure laws. Ms. Harris declined to pursue prosecutions in the case.”

Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.
So Biden/Harris will mandate that everyone wear a mask for the next 3 months if elected? Guess they think if elected they will be king/queen, well they can kiss a$$, I'm not a child that needs a parent to decide what is in my best interest. Food will be next watch and see.
“You’re not allowed to criticize Biden and you’re not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!”  Considering the fact this is the time period when he’s *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.
We can vote for Biden and hold him accountable at the same time. It’s not like our brains ran out of energy to do multiple things   Blindly swearing allegiance while not holding him accountable is a terrible idea.

Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.
This is ignorant of all the progress we've made these last years. The left is alive and strong. We will effectively pressure Biden and the democrats to clean up this mess. Our words are currently falling on deaf ears. It will not be like that after January.
placing my bet now that biden picks janet napolitano for secretary of education because of the way she successfully handled (fired, arrested, mowed down) striking graduate workers asking for #cola (cost of living adjustments)
Weird of Joe Biden to just drop by like that. He usually calls first.
By that superb logic. If you know I am POS, doesnt that make you a POS too? Takes one to know one? Right.  And for the record, I never once said I was  a Biden fan.   Thanks for playing.
“This nomination almost guarantees that valid criticism and utter hatred of Black women will be on full display, and we will have to quickly learn the difference and respond accordingly.”
Our only route to victory is hoping Biden gets more aggressive. We know that Trump is actively anti-environment and literally wants to accelerate the problem.
I think people are going to be genuinely surprised when this continues under a president Biden
So far, Biden and the DNC have shown a lot of contempt for progressives. We’ll vote for Biden, but only because it’s getting Trump out of office.
Biden/Harris, typical imperialist, corrupt, corporate-owned, and opportunist ticket from the #Democrats.  Do not vote for it and hope for a change.
.... now Joe Biden, he definitely is racist and has racist policies. Always has. That is easily proven. But I would like you to prove that Trump is. I bet you can't. You are pathetic.
The most effective way to ensure  continued and significant influence in a Biden administration is to elect a Democratic Senate majority.
With Elizabeth Warren sidestepped, Wall Street execs cheer Joe Biden's pick of Kamala Harris for VP |   Terrible
Why is AOC only being given 1 minute to speak at the DNC when she arguably one of the most popular Democrats right now?
It was not long ago that Kamala Harris was saying how much of are you racist Joe Biden is. Which he is. And so much more.
You obviously do not know anything about Kamala Harris. You might want to do some research before you support her. Much less Biden.
And this is the Joe Biden that they I think it's such a good guy.
this is the Joe Biden that so many I think it's such a good guy.
If she hadn’t blocked me I would ask her why she thinks centrists like Joe Biden are adamantly against progressive ideas like a wealth tax, which has majority support from Democrats, Independents and Republicans, since she loves democracy so much
Yes, it was 64% Biden/Harris before the bots were activated
Barbara Boxer says Kamala Harris should apologize for her prosecutorial record if she believes she erred  “Boxer, meanwhile, said Harris’s prosecutorial record really is a side issue, since she is running on Biden’s ticket and his views will come first.”💀
Oh biden wins
Better watch out, Kamalas body language indicates she is expecting to be President. Looks like the left is ready to declare Biden unfit for the duties as POTUS, allowing her to step in, looks like she knew that when she stepped out of the race. Michelle available?
Well said. I get that they want a prominent republican to show public support for Biden, but Kasich is a terrible choice.
Hey  we can call the  Biden/Kamala pair up: Captain Dementia and The Perpetual Incarcerator.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yes! I want to watch a woman who whole heartedly backed all of Joe Biden's accusers stand beside him and talk about how fabulous he is. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
..basically “messaging bills”.  Some of which she ran against during her primary campaign. I would say she has no guiding principles which is why I trust her less than Biden.

Saying Biden picked Kamala due to her sex and race instead of her qualifications is sexist and racist 🙄
Follow at  and read  to stay up to date on election odds for Biden/Trump. One of my favorite websites.
And you still haven't said how Biden is supposed to "save it". He's been at this since 73 so if he hasn't saved it yet it's because he can't.
Wasn’t even their first choice according to David Axelrod.  Biden wanted Whitner.
Warren’s event with Biden had 50k live viewers
Joe Biden has made it clear that he's a decent human being, in contrast to the corrupt and monstrous orange clown.
Biden Harris 2020  via   poot
Seems to me that everything Biden/Harris say they are going to do is already being done. They would however lock the country down so tight that when we were allowed to come out again we would be like Cuba/Venezuela. The country can't survive either one of them. #Trump2020
Hey  , how in the exact fuck is Biden/Harris gonna save our dying planet?
Why Biden won’t M4A : These assholes right here⬇️
You are my hero but I won’t be donating to Biden/Harris.   Neither of them support a wealth tax and that is my litmus test for donating. Harris is to the right of most Democrats on Israel as well. 😕
NPR talking about how financial managers are happy Biden chose Kamala Harris, I’m feeling nauseous
There was a lot of pressure from donors to pick Kamala Harris. Remember: Karen Bass is just as progressive as Warren and Biden still didn’t choose her.
that might be the secret of his success. sanders comey trump, democrats treat anyone who treats them like crap like gold. harris/biden proves they are not liberal now.
“That’s probably why we’re losing now”  Biden’s ahead of Trump in the polls.  No offense but you are kind of an airhead
Knit Picks' website isn't working and I need to get sock yarn, pronto, because knitting soothes anxiety (also I want my feet to be warm when I watch Biden/Harris win in the fall). If you have a fave place, please to tell. I'm looking at you,
No, I wanna keep that way. I'm still happy from watching BIDEN/HARRIS speech earlier!!!
Great reporting. You really nailed Biden here.
biden would bring back segregation, and harris would use the fbi to clean up the cities the way trump did. democrats screwed hillary because they are god damned nazis who deserve trump.
she is better choice then joe biden and hillary clinton, she dose not have  same backlash as both them.
Overwhelmed with the POSSIBILITIES that lie ahead of America with the leadership of Biden/Harris.......They are an amazing team.....
Between absolute cruising on his bike and the speech today, Biden is looking shockingly spry headed into the final stretch here. Honestly wasn’t sure he still had this in him.
vs   in March sounds lovely! Maybe we can invite President Biden? #wearamask #voteBlue #endthisnightmare
I’m feeling more apprehension. Wall Street seems to be happy with Biden’s choice. They typically don’t have Main Street’s best interests in mind.
Soooooo happy to watch Biden/Harris speak. There is hope, it actually cheered me up!! Who knew a speech would cheer me up?? LOL🙂#Biden/Harris 2020
Harris makes her real-life campaign debut side-by-side with Biden  via
you pushing biden/harris onto marginalized communities is u actively not acknowledging ur privilege and putting your comfort over people’s literal lives......if u can’t understand that i have no idea what to tell you
So everybody, please vote for what you believe in not the "lesser of 2 evils". Make your vote count and your voice be heard. If you do believe in Trump or Biden and vote the one you believe in then at least you are doing what you think is best and I will still support you.
He’s explaining why we won’t vote for Biden.
I’m all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden’s 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You’ve implied multiple times that young people’s opinions don’t matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it’s healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren’t thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
It really is dependent on the president.  Some presidents allow their VPs to have more power and influence, some don't.  If Biden has selected Warren (or Karen Bass!) that wouldve signaled a willingness to be more progressive.  Instead he chose Kamala Harris, an empty suit.
I know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both terrible politicians but please vote Democratic downballot in November 😔
Biden and Harris will be the best thing to happen to America sense Obama and Biden left office
Of course it is a shell game. But now we know it and time has come to change the game. This election is only part of it. But if Trump is elected again, the USA is dead and gone. At least with Biden, there is someone who will listen. Everything will change sooner than expected.
That Harris pick yesterday, hit Trump supporters like rabies! And yet, they know they would have hated ANYONE Biden picked.
Nothing about what I’ve said implies I’m not voting for Biden. We should be allowed to criticize the ticket
I believe that is the boat a lot of us are in. So, responding to every angry tweet with how if someone doesn't vote for Harris/Biden they will be ensuring mass deaths is really not necessary.  We know. We're angry and tired as hell, but we know.
Let me make this clear:  I am angry as hell that Kamala Harris was selected as VP.  But, me continually talking about just how pissed I am does NOT change my vote this November. I am still voting for Biden - I'm just even angrier about it than I was before.
Doesn’t attract any voter who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden. Young voters and progressives do not trust her
DwellerYsul, BULL HOCKEY! There was no infighting because the people pulling the strings on the Biden puppet were in full agreement. They knew enough not to bicker and put their brilliant plan to retake the WH in jeopardy. His only choice, if any, was for the prettiest one.
I don't ordinarily display political signs, but I ordered a Biden/Harris sticker, and I will display it proudly, full of hope! #BidenHarris2020
You can be angry with the VP choice and still vote for Biden.  Kamala Harris doesn’t support student debt relief, a wealth tax, or Medicare for All.  Her record as attorney general and DA has a lot of blemishes.   But at least she’s better than Mike Pence!
Yeah I’m voting for Biden as well
Oh yeah, Kamala is Joe Biden's little blue pill for sure.
I haven’t seen a single Warren person say they’re voting for Trump because of the Kamala VP choice  I have seen a ***lot*** of tweets from young people expressing their disdain and anger at Biden for his decision.
The way he uses stupid childish names to insult Biden and Kamala is beyond belief.
Let me debunk this lie:  Kamala Harris recorded her endorsement video for Joe Biden *before* Warren dropped out.
This comparison doesn’t feel right. I mean Biden is 71% campaigning in the background, so adjusted for that it seems he is doing much better.
CNN drops the death ticker the instant Biden is elected.
I know people in my own life that supported Biden and Kamala in the primaries and argued with me for months that didn’t even bother to register to vote in the primaries. These are deeply unserious people.
Joe is a friend to Wall St though...
You can't blame her for what has been in place for decades. But I sure as hell know that she and Biden are not Trump and are more open to change and reason. Get rid of Trump and the GOP in the Senate and the rest is much easier.
Criticize Harris and Biden but never forget the existential crisis we’re in right now. I’m voting for Biden and Harris and you should too. Then we’ll protest them too.
Biden had overwhelming black support in the south, specifically South Carolina. Across the country it was evenly split between him and Bernie.  Trump won suburban white women last time but the polling is showing he’s lost them.
Another liar. I bet you the farm that Biden did NOT say that.
And you're calling BIDEN racist. Give me a break, you lying hypocrite.
When will the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President receive security protection? Biden perhaps already has it because he’s a Former Vice President. Kamala Harris will need it immediately because of all of Trump’s crazy second amendment thugs. 👀👀
i’ve written out like a dozen draft tweets about the author of how to be an anti-racist supporting biden/harris and i just...... please........ why..............
That’s not gonna help fight against Biden’s lack of cognitive ability. He can’t get that back. Lol
no kate this is simply NOT POSSIBLE and i won’t entertain the thought for a SINGLE SECOND! i’m too busy settling for biden and thinking it’s an effective strategy to encourage disillusioned nonvoters!
The problem I see is Biden will continue shitty policy just be better at shutting up about it— he will deflect to KH who being a woman of color will be central to the discourse. So how much will actually change and how much will just be spit shined into something prettier?
For sure. He’s been my personal pick since I could vote, but all of them have done shit that’s negatively effected people. Yeah, imo Biden is the ‘lesser of two evils’. That doesn’t mean I have to like it or agree with him or not be unhappy about it. Just don’t want Trump again.
Thank you, Katy. The most heart wrenching aspect of the US politics is incrementalism. You aren’t going to fix it by accelerationism, and you can’t just skip to 2024. Every progressive should do everything in their power to make Biden a one term president.
I’m voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   If you’re not, you are only helping Donald Trump.   That’s your right, but I wish you could be adult enough to accept responsibility for the choice.
Well the Dems aren’t exactly known for playing “smart politics” as you say and I think what he said is spot on. It’s not like he’s openly stating he’s not voting Biden. The Dems cater to corporate interests and strive to be more concervative instead of truly progressive.
It’s kind of hilarious that the Biden team thinks choosing Harris is an actual appeal to the left. Yeah, let’s pick a prosecutor who has one of the most tumultuous relationships with the country’s Black community during historic anti-police protests.
I can’t get excited about Biden with anyone. Harris politically is somewhat undefined. But I do think having her on the ticket is a big step for this country. It does make more likely to vote for the ticket. Doesn’t mean I will ultimately.
Careful Kamala, joe Biden might rape you and then claim insanity. #CreepyJoeBiden #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Election2020 #Biden2020Landslide #SusanRice #BidenIsAPredator #BidenIsARacist #BlackLivesMatter #DNC #DNCisCorrupt
I just saw someone on Twitter ranting about Biden and Harris being our only chance to prevent authoritarianism. Haha! People are fucking insane. This country is fucked. Authoritarianism is our only option. Choose your flavor wisely. Vanilla or ultra vanilla. #BidenHarris2020
I've donated to Joe Biden on quite a few occasions, but on this special day I dug deep like many of you. Thank you Joe and thank you Senator Harris! Kamala was the only pick and I'm so pleased to have her on the ticket!
Some parts of our culture will maybe not progress as fast as they should with Harris. Police reform will be MUCH more likely if Biden wins though.. don't fool yourself.
Joe Biden said he would specify a woman for VP, he didn't say what race.  So Laura Ingrham must mean shame in him for choosing a POC. That's what she really means, right?
It might not even be that bad. If Biden wins, a more liberal congress and senate will likely follow. Universal health care will be closer to reality.. and maybe UBI will be at least discussed seriously.  If Trump wins.. holy shit.
The racist’s reaction to Joe Biden picking Senator Harris makes it clear how afraid they are of her.   They’re dumping everything they can on her (and him, of course)…but it’s just not working.
Wall Street executives are glad  Biden picked  Harris  "Harris, who generally could be called a centrist, will not push Biden to the left or the right on major policy issues,”  Wall Street won
Biden/Harris  -neither supports cutting the defense budget -neither supports student loan forgiveness -neither supports a wealth tax -neither supports breaking up Amazon/Facebook/Google  You’re obligated to vote for them but make sure you vote for actual progressives downballot..
Agreed. Biden really crushed any potential excitement for his campaign. Better than Trump/Pence (not saying much)
Ahead of Democratic convention, Biden leads Trump in new Wisconsin poll  via
Friendly reminder that EVEN if you don't like Biden's running mate or Biden... a vote for anyone other than him is a vote for Trump.
IMO, the only cabinet position that would be worth taking would be heading the Treasury Dept.  The rest would be a waste of Warren's talents.  If Biden isn't brave enough to make her his VP, then he definitely isn't brave enough to put her at the head of the Treasury.
The Warren supporters who are unsatisfied with Biden's VP choice because Harris isn't very progressive are signaling to Biden that he needs to move even more to the Left.   Critical tweets = signals to Biden's campaign that there is a deficit
There are 2 groups of people.  1. People who believe criticizing Biden may lead to him change the way he campaigns, making improvements, etc. "Constructive criticism helps."  2. People who believe all criticism is bad and only serves to hurt Biden and help Trump.
Biden has an enthusiasm gap problem.  He himself may not care about it and it may not matter in the end, ...but it does exist and the reason people are not enthusiastic about voting for Biden is because of the way he has run his campaign and the disdain he's shown to young voters
I like to think they (The Biden team) feel the same way you do. I think we all sort of get it. Bring on the ballsy woman of color. (I'm sure there's a better way of saying that).
Ah, we're at the stage of "If you criticize Joe Biden = You are voting for Trump!"  Please let's think/act like adults and not children. No one is perfect, especially not Biden
"Let her speak before you spend your nights helping Trump by attacking his opponents."  My god.  Did Biden's campaign destroy everyone's brain cells?  Criticism of Biden is not tantamount to supporting Donald Trump. Please think like an adult and not like a child
"He adopted some of her ideas in exchange for her support. That's politics. And Warren knows that. And she would do that because she believes in her plans more than a title."    No one is arguing that Biden adopting her plans is a bad thing, it's obviously a good thing.
Huh? Where did I say "Biden won because of Warren" ?? I said he used her donor network, because he did.   He literally did.    He had an event scheduled *today while he was announcing the VP choice*.  He used her network.  It feels gross.
I believe that to an extent-- Warren isn't a cow that can be milked to death.  She developed her grassroots network through hard work, networking, taking over a million selfies, etc., and Biden gets to reap the benefits.  She scratched his back-- Biden isn't scratching hers.
I'm sure Warren was happy to help Biden but I'm sure she was under the impression her impressive fundraising talents wouldve meant more in the veepstakes.  Seems like Harris was chosen to appease wealthy donors.  Entire thing sucks and feels gross
We are now stronger together with Biden/Harris 💙🇺🇸 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
No, I think Warren supporters have some legitimate grievances to feel angry about this entire thing.  Biden scheduled more events with Warren than with Harris-- why? Was it to get more campaign donations? He used Warren for her grassroots network.  It feels gross
When Trump calls something “horrible” bear in mind that he has an extremely limited vocabulary. If Harris had attacked Trump the way she went at Biden, Trump would certainly not have been man enough to put her on his ticket. Her ‘attack’ on him was factual, effective + justified.
There is no chance of her becoming Senate Majority Leader because Chuck Schumer will not give up power.  It's useless to even talk about it.  Biden used Warren supporters for campaign donations, we have a right to criticize and be angry.
I’m excited to vote for Biden / Harris 2020!!  Senator Harris, beyond all of her other accomplishments, has been a constant force for change from inside government. One cool thing she did was setup Open Justice, which increased transparency and accountab…
Didn’t the NRA say that about Obama/Biden and it never happened? Doesn’t seem like you know what you’re talking about.
the problem is its a markets arent always the best (yes we know) so we sit here and actually should probably vote for biden or trump will win
If you really want to freak out a Dump supporter just say that Biden will resign after a year and Kamala will be president. Watch their heads spin!
Joe Biden was baptized, confirmed, attends Mass and wasn't excommunicated therefore is he is Catholic. Given your strong pronouncement, I looked for a tweet about any of the 125 priests in your dioceses accused of pedophilia not being Catholic. Not a thing. Sad.
I wish Biden had chosen a progressive VP. Harris is a disappointing choice
👇👇👇👇👇and miss me with your concern-trolling about Biden or Harris. If you don’t think Biden-Harris is THEE ticket THIS YEAR, then vote for Trump like you planned to all along, but don’t pretend to be progressive.
Squad'll give President Biden some extra backbone.
Joe Biden: I want all the young Americans out there who have been protesting to know, I hear you! And my choice for Vice  President will assuredly always "Defend the Police!"
“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent how far America has come since defeating the Confederacy”  Joe Biden is not that old 💀
We will if Biden/Harris win in November. Get out and vote RED!
And I’m going to talk shit as I turn in my vote for Biden
I prefer progressive.... and you bet your ass I’m going to talk shit about Biden and Trump despite who wins!!!!! (Though, a Biden cabinet will be much much better).
The new talking point is already out. To say that it was racist to pick the VP based on race is racist because Trump is racist and anyone else is racist for not supporting Biden's racism about the race of his running mate pick...  The logic is simply dizzying. Literally.
Is there a memorable debate moment ft. Kamala Harris that doesn’t involve her calling Joe Biden a racist?
Watched Harris and Biden’s rhetoric with one another tonight on Hannity  My god what Are they thinkin About? Can it be true that the full Democratic Party endorses this Union?
Biden has my vote but my $$$ goes directly to Warren Dems from now on
For the record, I would’ve liked Karen Bass to be on the ticket with Biden and the way the media (and the other VP choices) helped smear her is reprehensible
I really hope someone on Biden’s campaign is paying attention to the backlash from the VP announcement
Thanks for the follow back. Biden/ Harris High hopes for Utah!
people can have a problem with harris’ past &amp; still vote for biden/harris this election. just bc they point out an issue doesn’t mean their support isn’t there. a lot of people are voting for biden BECAUSE it’s their only option.
Feels like Biden’s campaign doesn’t want support from young, minority voters.   I am disappointed with the VP choice.
Okay, so...  8/9/2020 - James "Kamala" Harris passes away. 8/11/2020 - Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate. COINCIDENCE? Where the fuck is  ?!
Right now the odds are Biden with a 64% chance of winning, but since you're a fan of trump, I'll just bet even odds.
like people can take issue and critique the people running for office, that’s their right and it something they should do!! even if you’re voting for biden/harris you should still know their entire background and be critical of them?? that’s a normal thing to do as a voter
I suspect that Biden’s excellent choice has more to do with winning the election than with being vice president. My hunch is that Warren is the one (on his list) he works best with. She will doubtless get top cabinet post, and Harris will make a more enjoyable VP than even Pence.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have spent their careers upholding policies that disadvantage POC and immigrants when they had the opportunity to stand up for what was right.
Young democrats / liberals: stop gaslighting progressives by attempting to shame us into voting for a candidate that we’re morally opposed to. We ALL know what is at risk. We ALL know what a vote for Joe Biden means.
Old white women are probably the only coalition Biden already had locked in. Wtf are you talking about?
“Smart, tough, and ready to lead” is how Joe Biden describes Kamala Harris.   Can you imagine Donald saying anything thing like that about a former rival?
Lol electoral priorities like... oh Biden doesn’t have any? He’s not actually about policy at all? He opposes marijuana legalization and M4A which both have sky high approval rating?
Won't lie, I was hoping for a VP Susan Rice. What a class act you are, and what a stellar public servant. I can't help but think there will be a great role for you with President Biden, as he works to try to save the world. Team America!
Harris said she believes Biden’s accuser (of sexual assault).  Both are going to have to answer for that.
just $1 mill more than Warren pulled in at a random event she did for Biden.  😴
Started a weekly donation to the Biden/Harris campaign. We're in the homestretch now, and we must do all we can to fight the rise of fascism in the United States.  #BidenHarris2020

At least Biden/Harris will not KILL &gt;162,000 Americans like tRump/Pence &amp; the irresponsible response to #COVID19 turning it into #TrumpPandemic   America can return to a country based on what is best for the country rather than what is better for #TrumpCrimeFamily
I'll take that.  Biden will get absolutely destroyed in a debate. I'm no Trump fan but to think he'd back down from Biden is laughable.
Trump's entire re-election strategy is based on fear. Biden's is based on positive and reassuring goals. The choice is so simple between those two candidates.
not to mention the barrage of vitriol and hatred the right is likely going to unleash upon black women bc of Harris, though, that was likely inevitable with any black woman on the ticket.   The least Biden could have done is pick one who hasn't jailed hundreds of POC.
Please don’t vote for Biden... Or Trump... #VoteGold
This does, in fact, make me like Biden a bit more.  I was gonna vote for Biden anyway, tbf, but his selection of Harris at least makes me feel a bit better about it.
Treasury is really the only spot where she would be able to make *real* change but Biden is too much of a coward to ask her to run it
and much like romanticizing your ex, electing biden is a stupid mistake that won't fix anything
realizing i’m gonna have to vote for biden/harris
Biden must not have understood when he heard she did well with the poles....
It really doesn’t matter cause the winner is ether Donald Trump or Joe Biden by not voting for Joe Biden that takes away one step away from evicting trump which YOU CLEARLY WANT please just vote for Biden and tolerate him and Kamala for the next 4 years
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Biden just lost the election and a not-so-civil war seems ever-more likely after November 😔
A few Bernicrats and Warren or die folks seem to prefer death by Trump to sensible policies and leverage for democracy by Harris and Biden. Honestly, i don't think there is anything much we can do to help such purist outlier haters, we just need regular folks to vote louder.
Lastly:    If Biden isn't brave enough to make Warren his VP, he definitely isn't brave enough to make her the Treasury Secretary.  His wealthy donors would never allow it.  He'll probably try to pigeonhole her in something innocuous like the Dept of Ed.  Hopefully she says no
Giving rich people special access to our politicians is nauseating and undemocratic.  My money will only go to politicians who support a wealth tax and student debt relief, Biden/Harris support neither.    They will get my vote but they dont get my money. Hell no
I am planning to vote for Joe Biden but I won't be donating to the campaign.  There's no point.   Biden and Harris both spent a large percentage of their time during the primary tap dancing for wealthy donors at private events.  Harris hasn't pushed Biden left on anything.
Kamala Harris being chosen to run as Biden's VP is extremely disappointing.  She has flipped on several major progressive issues and is more conservative than Biden on Israel/Palestine.  I initially supported her primary campaign but realized she was not a good manager nor leader
Yep ... you've lost a lot of us ! #Biden #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpHasNoPlan
The only thing you will ever be recognized for...the death of thousands due to your "Trump Virus". #TrumpHasNoPlan #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
Biden isn’t brave enough to appoint her to that position.  He’s a coward, he’ll ask if she wants to lead the Educ department or somewhere else innocuous
On a sad day for college football, Joe Biden did the right thing #BidenHarris2020Vision #GlassHalfFull
Elizabeth Warren would have been an infinitely much better VP than Kamala Harris. It’s true. That’s why Biden adopted a bunch of her plans and none of Kamala’s. “Warren has a plan for that!”  She’s guided by her moral compass, we need more people like that leading the country.
Please talk about what you will do to curtail your "Trump Virus". Looks like football is not happening, dude ! #Trump2020Landslide #FoxNews #Biden
😂😂😂 It's Happening ! #Trump2020Landslide #Biden Biden-Harris
Hell is prepared for Trump's eventual arrival. Ob that note, I like the Biden/Harris ticket👍🏻
😂😂 Sore Loser...your guy is doomed ! #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
It is truly exhausting in my bones to see the flurry of “don’t forget who we’re fighting” commentary. I haven’t; Biden and Harris are also the enemy. Your vote is almost meaningless. By all means, vote for them. I probably will too. /1
What's the strongest statement Biden has made about not running in 2024?
Conservatives claiming that Biden and Kamala are even more left than Bernie is laughable 😂🤣😂🤣
Who cares?  Biden-Harris is going to wipe the floor with you.
Guess Biden picked the right one.
Biden knows corn pop and Kamala’s a cop.
Joe Biden adopted 4-5 plans from Warren’s primary campaign and literally zero from Kamala Harris’s campaign.    I suppose we should be thankful.
A no vote for Biden Harris is a vote for trump
Not quite sure that the decision tells us this. I think Biden might think that Harris will work well as a defense against the left (and the protest movement) in a way that the various midwestern white women he considered would not.
Biden adopted 4-5 of Warren’s policies and literally zero from Kamala Harris.  This stinks
Biden is problematic, yes. But I would vote for a literal brick to get t-rump out. This upcoming election is about peoples survival. An old potato is better than a poisonous cheeto.
One last thing to be clear, Biden and Harris, is a way, WAAYY better choice than Trump, I'm just disappointed that the policies don't match 100% to what I believe will bring real tangible change for the people who need it the most.
Trump ends his press conference with the false claims Kamala Harris and the Democrats want to “take away for second amendment.” Before reporters can counter, he ends the presser and bolts away. #Trump #Biden #BidenHarris2020
For the most part, it's fine. She's definitely more progressive leaning and can read the room better than Biden. But at the same time, I have reservations for some aspects of her, including that she was a cop.did anyone know that Joe Biden has dementia   Disease not sure if its at the early stages or not but I've seen what that can do to a person 🤔 and some people want him in the White house ?
Pretty much sums up
Big mood.  I've seen this in conservative friends and family.  Either dissatisfaction about what the GOP has become or full on unwavering support of conspiracy theories, racism, sexism and intolerance.
The FCC #FairnessDoctrine was a policy requiring the holders of broadcast licenses to present issues of public importance in a manner that was honest, equitable, and balanced. GOP eliminated the policy and Fox News was launched. #FauxNews #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Kamala #Biden
Sanders was the only one trying to block it because the other Dems weren’t opposed to Obama privatizing the Post Office the way they are opposed to Trump doing it.  Important to remember under any Biden admin. Yes? 🤔
Probably not. Why pick on Cenk when we’ve got Biden/Harris to talk about?
Kamala Harris is the same as most people. If she thinks it benefits her then it doesn’t matter who it hurts .?Even if she lies to get her way . Probably learned it was ok 👌🏽 from Ms Clinton ! Biden is same !
Dr. Biden is not worried. Joe’s not the man he used to be.
Backwards thinking 🤔 about Trump ! He has created millions of jobs and the trade deficit is moving in the right deriction . The Biden energy plan will kill jobs and the economy.  Those are facts look them up !
Following
Fake news , Im sure Biden and Harris are just waiting to win the election to cure COVID-19. Or maybe it will just go away because it’s just a over reach to tear down the economy and make Trump look bad .
Schools will open after Biden is elected.
Obama/Biden put more kids in cages at the borders and lost track of them
People’s fear of losing to Trump overrode any excitement her campaign might have generated. But now that we have a “safer” candidate in Biden, people are more comfortable embracing the Harris thrill.
1. He’s right.  2. Where was Eric when the NYT was trashing our best chance to beat Trump and slurring Tara Reade?  Eric has helped to prop up the Biden/Harris kamikaze ticket by trashing the alternative too.
Speaking of Biden as a 3rd grader?
That’s the whole underlying strategy of the Biden campaign and the so-called Never Trumpers.
Not weird. Joe Biden has advanced dementia and can’t answer questions.
All true.  I think we should vote Trump out and then hold Biden and Harris accountable for legalizing sex work especially on worker safety, fair pay, and other economic grounds. We need to vote.  #Cult45 has laid down the fundamental elements of a 4th Reich. Job #1 destroy him.
This is a delusional political propaganda conspiracy. Calling Trump a racist is like calling Joe Biden sane ! It just doesn’t make sense. Check your facts ! Not the latest conspiracy theory!
I know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I’m thinking that you can’t help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
How do you know?  Obama didn’t immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don’t need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every “Trump” to “Biden” and every “Biden” to “Trump”.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... naïve.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Kamala only said she believed those women who said Biden's touching made them uncomfortable. None of them accused Biden of sexual abuse except for the discredited Tara Reade.  Kamala  never said she believed Reade.
This isn’t about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
She and Biden are the mass incarceration ticket. #ChainsYouCanBelieve in should be their campaign slogan.
But I'm not voting Biden/Harris
With the announcement of the Biden-Harris ticket, I’m more convinced than ever that we need a well organized and coordinated #GeneralStrike.   #ChainsYouCanBelieveIn
Why do the Biden Dems look and sound like Reagan Republicans? Even the “big tent” is a Reagan line.
We already know what we have with Trump. 4 more years of this is gonna be catastrophic. Biden isn't the best but abstaining from voting or not voting for Biden/Harris guarantees our demise. A lot of us see voting for Biden/Harris as taking an L...we need to think long game.
Vote for Biden, lower your expectations, and start listening to POC.
Is he helping pay for Biden campaign staff???🤷‍♂️🤨🤨🤨. If not fuck him
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Using that same logic, a vote for third party is a vote for Trump. A vote for third party is a vote for Biden. As a #VoteGreen’r, my argument is... a vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteGreen
You can’t tell anyone who thinks Biden is “center left” anything.
#UnitedLeft is explicitly anti-Biden.
Hardly. It will collapse if Biden doesn’t win.
Isn't Wisconsin a bit cash-strapped right now because of the virus which you refuse to do anything about? You were one of the first to cry Russia hoax. and yet look where you are getting your information from now, so is this now the Biden hoax?
Yup the dnc made a horrible mistake appointing biden thinking it was safe then told him to take harris who has a horrible track record prosecuting young black males, also many democrats are gun owners and both are very anti-firearms
What a joke Biden is.
Not the proper role of a President, Biden is a fool.
Proof that Biden has no idea of what a President does.
Biden won't solve these problems.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Bingo! Joe Biden showed he understands real politics and does not bear personal grudges. In short, Biden is a grownup.
It also shows how badly out of touch Dem leadership is, in nominating Joe Biden during a plague and then pushing him to take Kamala Harris as his running mate during an anti-cop uprising.
Imagine a real leader. No need to imagine. Joe Biden is that leader.
Biden said he would pick a woman. He didn't qualify that with Black or white.
So good of you to campaign for Biden-Harris against your party.
Beto is 100% for Joe Biden. And Beto is a current and future star in the Democratic Party.
My stepson spent more of his life behind bars than out because of Joe Biden. He's a fascist who is the reason schools are still segregated and so many people are in prison for non-violent crime.
I think we should mix it up this year and have Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.
How will Biden and Harris take us to the middle? They're nearly as right as Trump.  Teach kids how to be grifters and thieves? Yes, I'm against that.
And Trump is hated by a majority of America because he actually committed real crimes, unlike your weird Biden conspiracies.
You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
You mean Biden, the serial pawer?
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Honest answer. Biden is going to win, dems will get to at least 50 in the senate and the house will hold or expand. We don't give two shits what "half" of the country thinks. You people have helped this animal bring the country to its knees.
Whether Kamala Harris was my 1st choice or not, she is who is on the Biden ticket now and anybody- even Tulsi Gabbard- would be better than the tRump ticket! Even if there was no one in the VP position that'd be better than the current guy!
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
I don’t have a problem. We need Biden Harris to win!
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He’s one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? 🤔
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I’m Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I’m voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
It’s time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I’m reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say “I’d run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden” but I’m not seeing y’all actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where’s that devotion? 🤔
Just a quick moment to let my mutuals know that I may be critical of biden/Harris but that does not mean in any way that I am voting for the hobgoblin in office, nor that I disagree with getting Dems back in office.  They just have a lot to prove to me and I hope they do so
amazing segment on Camarla Harris.. when u got to the Biden part, u &amp; I both erupted in laughter at exact same time and exact same fashion. I literally died.. I needed to be revived..
Because Biden is more conservative and authoritarian like a normal republican candidate. Come on dude u should know that
I’m voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I’ve seen and heard put forth.  They’re gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.
is a fucking liar, referring to him not knowing about Kanye Wests intention of stealing Biden votes.   They cooked this shit up and it will backfire on the  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteByMail2020
Are you sure she didn't mean Trump? Is she predicting violence against Biden?
The parts Biden wrote into law?
I still say John Kasich shouldn’t be there at all. There’s no legitimate reason. The #NeverTrump crowd practically nominated Biden.  Why does the strongest candidate to beat Trump need Kasich? 🤔
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
CNN firmly in Biden camp
Nice to know!! Biden can’t tell the difference between the toilet or a shower. Let that sink in! No worries, Biden can’t find the sink so you’re safe.😂🤪
Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I’m not disaffiliated.  I’m very much a conservative which is why I don’t like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won’t complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers—I don’t recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.
Sorry, I tend to do that to Biden Bros.
I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won’t make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you’re hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it’s a small number, I doubt it’s negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That’s not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can’t do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I’d consider volunteering for them but it’s Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
Moderately.  She’s very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the “adult” and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he’s saying it was a poor choice from Biden’s perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I’m more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might’ve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She’s like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.
Privileged entourage vote for Biden, privileged enough not to care.
Twitter all in for Jie Biden
Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I’m really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It’s a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.
Game over for Trump. Biden by chosing Kamala has assured a strong democratic base turnout and that was Trumps only hope to find a way to turn back the blue tsunami coming this November
I recall us making a wager in 2018 regarding Harris being chosen by Biden if he were to win the nomination. I said that if I were wrong I would put a Trump photo on Twitter. You said Biden wouldn’t and if he did you would post photo of you kissing your own ass :)
I’ve been arguing that Harris’ callout during that debate was a point in her favor. Biden needs people who will call him on bullshit, not people who only know how to kiss ass.
If Trump is still flailing by Election Day, I think a significant number of his supporters will stay home rather than risk voting.   Biden supporters will crawl through glass even if he is ahead by 20.
Harris is a Black woman who explicitly supports prison slavery.  Joe Biden is a white man whose greatest political achievement made prison slavery a huge business.  Yes, it’s a pro-slavery ticket. Any questions?
Trump thinks Biden picking Harris is a sign of weakness.
Dear Dr. Biden:  I am so excited to vote for your husband.  The last three and one half years have been difficult and working in public education and I have seen so many changes .  We need change and we look forward to your husband being elected.
Yes, I do still think we won’t be driven into a communist country under Biden.  You need to work on word definitions; here’s a good start -  Communism is a political/economic system, a classless society which the major means of production, are owned and controlled by the public.
Cheaters, Biden family gets rich at serving country.
It’s going to be hard for the Putin/Trump campaign to persuade Leftists that Harris is a neo-liberal shill while also telling the Trump base that she is the Marxist controller for Joe Biden.   Especially if we keep highlighting the contradiction.
In a classic moment of sentimentality temporarily eclipsing voting priorities... I was considerably more excited when I heard Kamala Harris had Church of God roots than I was earlier today, when I heard she was Biden's pick for VP nom. Still, a solid choice.
Enough with being cautious.   Biden/Harris will win.

Trump, you are disrespectful to women, veterans, the disabled, people of color, health experts, healthcare workers, journalists, as well as ignorant of the Constitution and history. Go to hell!
Is it wrong for me to say I think I like her more than Biden? Congrats Sen. Harris. Give 'em hell, and make me proud of my original home state. #KamalaHarrisForVP
She doesn’t stand against the people who stand against #BlackLivesMatter. She stands with the cops against the working class, like Biden and Trump.
Exactly. I understand people who feel like they have to vote against Trump. That’s a sane reaction. I would think about it if I were in a swing state.  I don’t understand people who swear Biden will be progressive.
It’s not progressive without #MedicareForAll. That’s the bare minimum and Biden couldn’t do that.  What do you find progressive in it?
Biden is a servant of the oligarchy establishment, so picking Harris was not a surprise, and predictable. If he wasn't such a blabbermouth fuck up when it comes to race, he probably would've picked military-contractor-defending Elizabeth Warren.
Do you think Biden knows what that website says?
We’re absolutely on the same page. A friend of mine actually changed her mind about holding her nose and voting for Biden over this.  It feels unwise of him in the midst of a pro-abolition uprising.
Biden was one of the authors of the original, 1990s, version of the PATRIOT Act that anti-Clinton Repubs opposed because Clinton was President. They passed it for Bush after 9/11 though.  Trump’s ICE and military abuses in the US are legal because of the PATRIOT Act.
Biden is Catholic
Biden/Harris gets my vote! ☑️
The trouble is that we don’t have established “trustworthy” leftists yet. Not with a modern political framework. Even  who I usually agree with, is taking a “but Trump” approach to Biden’s candidacy.
Not really, the PUMAs supported McCain because of Palin. KHive was essentially threatening to support Trump if Biden chose anyone else.
Thank you, Mr. Biden!!!!
Right. And the problem is even if he “wins” they’re lowering the bar with the base where if Biden doesn’t start drooling on his podium, he will look competent
Commentators: "Picking  really addresses Trump's criticism of   Why is Biden concerned with addressing the criticism of an intellectually-deficient psychopath? Is he running for Trump's vote?!
There will likely be 3 debates. Trump needs them now. And the right’s narrative that Biden is in dementia is delusional. It’s also stupid. If you say your opponent is going to shit his pants, and then he doesn’t, you’ve kind of played yourself
I hope Biden didn't make this selection just for the black woman demographic. Sen. Harris is smart, tough, compassionate. And will be an excellent VP.
They will really have no identity (or home) after a Biden win.
He thinks your argument sounds like the troll arguments to vote for Biden.

Thank you, Joe Biden. Great choice. I am overjoyed. Onward to victory in November!
Don't think I was attacking you personally? I don't appreciate being called an idiot. I think Harris treated Biden like crap during debate. I thought Rice was much better candidate.
I've said all along I want Kamala but understood Joe Biden gets to pick and I will support his choice no matter who. I do not understand sour grapes politics. Winning requires unity; governance requires compromise, damnit!
Me? Universal healthcare: One goal, many paths. Biden-Harris will craft a great plan.
Kamala Harris Is An Excellent Pick For Joe Biden!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hallelujah!!! Thank you, Joe Biden!
Right? I’m still terrified by the thought it’s going to be Biden or Trump.
Somebody should ask this idiot what the 19th Amendment is &amp; if he understands that women suffragettes were beaten and jailed by police in their cause of gaining women the right to vote. Who gives a damn that some men might be insulted by Biden's choice?
I honestly am not a big fan of Kamala Harris...I get the feeling that she does a lot of pandering and grandstanding.  I haven't quite gotten genuine policies from her.  But ill be DAMED if that deters me from voting for her.  Let's hope Biden/Harris gives the ppl what we need.
She Will be amazing. She'll take no crap from anyone! Very excited and renews my faith I this country! We Will be great again with President Biden and Vice President Harris!

So you think this kinda behavior is helping you. The polls are showing that Biden is stedly climbing a head of you dude. STOP
Well since she’s libertarian id assume you’d vote republican but the point is any third party vote goes towards trump’s re-election b/c if you don’t want to vote for him and don’t vote for biden you’re helping him anyway
Biden will be the 45th president.  Stop counting Grover Cleveland twice.
Everyone’s going “and Biden’s the one we’re concerned about” in regards to trumps fucking astronomical stupid statement, and like, my dudes, you can say both are far gone old racist fucks that are going senile. You can continue to throw shit at Biden while you vote for him
Maga is tired of you too. Enjoy 4 more years cause Biden sure isn't bringing it home for the Dems.
The DNC doesn’t vote. Voters picked Biden. That is how we do things in a democracy.
Your being stuck on the idea that Bernie could not lose fair and square makes you as rigid as Trump’s base. Take a deep breath and snap out of it. Bernie has endorsed Biden.
Biden isn’t “trash.” It is essential that Trump be dethroned, wouldn’t you agree? How can that happen? One way: we have to elect Biden. Fortunately, within the realm of real possibility, he’s not a bad pick. He can bring us back from the abyss.
She endorsed Biden, so it’s very unlikely she will show at a third party convention.Joe Biden + Kamala Harris = AntiCatholicism Ticket?  via
Does Pope Francis Endorse Joe Biden? Globalist Pact?  via
Pretty much sums up
Kamala Harris is the same as most people. If she thinks it benefits her then it doesn’t matter who it hurts .?Even if she lies to get her way . Probably learned it was ok 👌🏽 from Ms Clinton ! Biden is same !
I hope so! I’m losing faith this country can remain 1 country. Biden isn’t only opposite of my way of thinking but dangerous for our country and the world.
Pretty soon he’ll say Biden will raise them to 125%.
Shows zero understanding of foreign relations under Trump. Jihad Biden is ready to drag us back to Obama time  and erase all the good done in the Mid East. As usual, he brags about his ignorance.
Backwards thinking 🤔 about Trump ! He has created millions of jobs and the trade deficit is moving in the right deriction . The Biden energy plan will kill jobs and the economy.  Those are facts look them up !
Fake news , Im sure Biden and Harris are just waiting to win the election to cure COVID-19. Or maybe it will just go away because it’s just a over reach to tear down the economy and make Trump look bad .
Bottom line: There’s just nothing to support your nonstop requests for them to “get out there”.  They’re out there, so is Biden, Obama, Warren.  What else are you looking for?
And what would AOC say if the Union had endorsed Biden? Does the same description apply only now to your preferred candidate- lethal weapons, preferential, etc?
Wake up. Biden isn't winning shit
This is a delusional political propaganda conspiracy. Calling Trump a racist is like calling Joe Biden sane ! It just doesn’t make sense. Check your facts ! Not the latest conspiracy theory!
It took audacity for Biden to choose Harris? “The essence of audacity is having the bravery to do something that could offend others. Because of this, the word has both positive (bravery, bold) and negative (rude, impudent, disrespectful) connotations.” Go Joe! #BidenHarris2020
That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Stop screwing up the Post Office. My neighbor didn't receive her medications on time &amp; she had a stroke. This has got to stop! You are hurting your voters. For my neighbor's husband; he is now voting for Biden. This will have huge backlash against you. Fire DeJoy now! Resign now.
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
Way back then, the smart, young people in the Obama White House laughed at Slow Joe. He hasn't got any smarter.
So your shower is producing adequate water flow?  The watergate issue seems to only concern Fearful Leader Trump.  Biden and VP Kamela have not had one press conference or strategy meeting on low flow shower heads.
"For over a year now the media has tried to paint Joe Biden as a centrist candidate. Now that he’s picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, the media is doing its best to reinvent her as a moderate consensus candidate as well."
We already know what we have with Trump. 4 more years of this is gonna be catastrophic. Biden isn't the best but abstaining from voting or not voting for Biden/Harris guarantees our demise. A lot of us see voting for Biden/Harris as taking an L...we need to think long game.
Also imagine thinking Biden is the radical left...LMAOOO no ma’am. He’s a transphobic capitalist with dementia :( not radically left AT ALL
It doesn’t.  We use UPS, FedEx, or Amazon Logistics for ballots only to get Biden-Harris into office and then go about fixing the
Lifelong Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted - CNN Politics
I’m amazed a good Catholic like Biden supports final term abortion, says nothing ab riots in major cities, and endorses a muderous regime like China - an atheist country!
I love Tik Tok  I have no problem signing up to this China owned company and agreeing to give them access to my phone, contacts emails location search history etc  Oh wait  The Biden campaign staff is not allowed to use TikTok for some strange reason? Hmmm
You aren’t going to solve them with Biden either.
My father (MN) Trump My mother (MN) Biden (?) My wife (OR) Biden My brother (MN) Biden My sis-in-law (MN) Biden Myself (OR) Biden
Biden said he would pick a woman. He didn't qualify that with Black or white.
The radical left believes it would be able to push Slow Joe around like a rocking chair in an old folks home.
I’m saying that it will pull very few votes, that Kanye is basically a #maga dude, and the impact will likely be felt more on the right than the left.  The guy is a conspiracy theorist that wears a #maga hat.  What about that says “Biden alternative”?
You assume Black voters will split from Biden and go to Kanye because...he’s Black?

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
You mean Biden, the serial pawer?
Whether Kamala Harris was my 1st choice or not, she is who is on the Biden ticket now and anybody- even Tulsi Gabbard- would be better than the tRump ticket! Even if there was no one in the VP position that'd be better than the current guy!
I don’t have a problem. We need Biden Harris to win!
And, you know what?, feel free to hold off on airing Biden/Harris events until they can be fact checked as well.  Make it a practice to fact check ALL of these sorts of things. (Don’t worry...there will be less work involved with the Biden/Harris events).
We all know that Democrats will take Biden off the ticket for health reasons. He has mental decline and she was just stating a feeling that the Dems won’t let him continue.
Coming from Biden himself.
I mean take it from Biden himself.
Thank goodness Joe Biden is now receiving daily intel reports so we have someone minding the store!
Just a quick moment to let my mutuals know that I may be critical of biden/Harris but that does not mean in any way that I am voting for the hobgoblin in office, nor that I disagree with getting Dems back in office.  They just have a lot to prove to me and I hope they do so
Because Biden is more conservative and authoritarian like a normal republican candidate. Come on dude u should know that
I am pleased to see you running with Mr Biden. It’s refreshing to see your energy and intelligence. We need your positivity.
Look, voting for Biden/Harris is unmistakably the right thing to do when the alternative is Trump/Pence. There's no question about that.  But you should know that doesn't mean you have to pretend they don't have flaws or act like they're your best friends.
Man everyone warming up to Biden as the "harmless uncle" of Obama because he wasn't Dick Cheney really did a number on some people's brains.
No you aren't. Trump trailing Biden in ALL swing states even Florida &amp; TX. 96% of what?
Yay. Vote Biden-Harris 2020. An entire press conference without even 1 lie. Trump lies all the time. He is stupid &amp; lazy.
Tears of joy may prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s- from the halfsheimer’s Biden is fighting already.
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Whew. That Biden is now receiving daily intel briefings makes me feel better. Let’s hope Biden gets the real reports and not the Big Book variety tRump receives.
That doesn’t mean they are campaigning with her. It means they felt she was the better option at the time. Between the two of them Biden is the better option now, outside of third parties. I don’t deny reality, and the reality is Kamala Harris is NOT progressive.
This is a very well-written and well-reasoned piece.  Kamala Harris, Gen X’s Moment, and the Fall of House Boomer  via
Proclaiming we need to get Biden elected, because Trump is a danger to this country, and lying out your ass and saying  is progressive are two completely different things. I know  knows better than this.
You have some out there beliefs. There is no 3rd party. If you don't vote for Biden than you are voting for Donald Trump. What is your problem with Sen Harris?
At least she and Biden can speak in complete sentences
"The #RepublicanParty — whose best idea to deal with its deficit among minority voters is promoting the sad candidacy of Kanye West to divert a few Black votes from Biden — is only becoming more insular and resentful."
Hang in there. After Biden wins &amp; turns things around &amp; you will find most will never admit to being a MAGAt.
Biden has had 3x the lead Obama had over McCain pretty much the entire time.
"You remember Kamala Harris. She’s the one who, as California’s Attorney General, held back exculpatory evidence about a chap on death row in order to burnish her ‘tough on crime’ image."
Like what I pointed out, I am not a big fan of her, but that does not take away her qualification. She is smart &amp; capable of doing the job, she just was not selected b/c Kamala Harris happens to be a better choice for Joe Biden. Let's focus on giving the same choice to our ppl
I just think it's funny that despite the fact that West...  - is certifiably mentally ill and needs help - wears a #maga hat - openly supports Trump  ...the fact that he's Black was somehow enough to make them think that voters would switch from Biden.
Ok yes Biden is a creep and Kamala is a cop but if you think capitalist centrists are just as bad as openly racist, sexist, xenophobic FASCISTS then I literally don’t know where your head is at. Politics is a game and these equivocations are going to ruin the left’s chances
Just listened to Klobuchar and after 30secs of her droning voice, now undertsand why she wasn’t selected by the DNC - boring monotone. Nice lady who screwed up early on with cop cases - she claims to be close with Kamala - who b/c of Biden, will have lots of friends for 90 days.
Biden Harris is more a moderate conservative ticket than a liberal one, which is unacceptable to many.  However-  The current appointee in charge of USPS is removing mail sorting machines across the country. Not voting is not a solution.   #BidenHarris2020
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
biden the republican using black people as mascots vote blue no matter who though
This foo said “joe Biden has a racism problem” 💀
Yes. I hope it burns their asses as they watch tRump poll numbers tank &amp; Biden-Harris shoot up.
Biden/Harris gets my vote! ☑️
Anyone mad at Harris for accepting the VP nom Bc she and Biden got into it during the debates is completely missing the point. What’s she supposed to do, ignore him and not step into this role where she has a chance to improve things?
Turnout will be historic trump will lose by double digits Biden/Harris will garner 97 percent of the black vote and the Asian vote will move from 67 percent to close to 80 percent.The cake is baked.
To these guys, Biden is:  - Demented - Radical/commie - Unable to speak clearly - Stuck in his basement  All things that are SUPER easy to dispel or are just ridiculously low bars to clear.  Trump's messaging is poor.
Joe Biden: "probably the best sort of pizza is a cream cheese pizze"  get the fuck outta here Joe
I mean yeah that's the thing, Harris is about as left as I think Biden was likely to pick and people who say otherwise are deluding themselves.
It's true though! The most famous thing about Biden before Obama picked him was how he shamelessly ripped off a Welsh politician's speech and backstory even though it didn't even fit his own background.
It may not really signify anything more than the fact that Biden is self-aware enough to know that as a man in his 70s he may literally not survive four years as President.  But Harris is still an unusually well vetted pick.
All I'm going to say about Kamala is I'm actually surprised Biden didn't just pick an empty suit for VP considering that's what most candidates due (including, let's be honest, Obama).
You knew that was coming as soon as the announcement was made. If the Biden campaign was smart, they should’ve waited until after his 5pm est campaign conference started then make the announcement so it throws his nonsense off kilter.
I donated to her campaign and I’m getting out the check book and sending in another check for Biden Harris 2020 #JoeBiden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just count on a Biden/Harris admin putting competent cabinet level people in place, not to mention any judicial positions.
Biden keeps makin' me not want to vote. Amazing.
honestly better tv than Biden and trump 😂
am I wrong?  Seems like Biden maybe asleep at the wheel here.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate! Biden-Harris 2020 here we come!
I don't think a lot of people here is going to understand the repercussions of selecting Kamala Harris as the VP... someone who didn't poll well at all (single digit polling before dropping out). Biden's best chance at beating Trump laid outside of the DNC contenders.
Well since she’s libertarian id assume you’d vote republican but the point is any third party vote goes towards trump’s re-election b/c if you don’t want to vote for him and don’t vote for biden you’re helping him anyway
Big Poll Numbers For Joe Biden!
$50 says Trump makes some sort of remark about Biden’s VP not being attractive enough to represent the country.
To be fair, this is what we SHOULD do.  Joe Biden was always more likely to get the Dem nod.  This is a winner-take-all system, so closer to the center often wins.  But there are lots of progressive activists that will be part of the coalition.  Elect Biden, then get to work.
That's because you're not voting for Biden which means you ain't black😁
Remembering when I worried about POTUS withholding aid to Ukraine until they dished dirt on Biden.
Biden could pick my cat who is routinely outsmarted by his own tail and has a catnip addiction, and I would vote for him.
Maybe someone should remind the media that he has had to have brain surgery on both sides of this brain and obviously it had lasting effects. Joe Biden needs to have some sort of testing done before the election. #JoeBiden #BidenCognitiveDecline #donalddump #trump2020
Are you confusing Biden with Bernie??? That’s a Bernie image.
DC will burn down! It’s going to be bad but worse overall for the country if Biden wins.
Another thing on Biden’s To-do list!
I will still vote for Biden it he selects Baily Sen. Warren's dog. 😃
I don’t think Trump is going to beat Biden at this point, but his mental health is obviously a concern.
Where in the picture did Biden touch you?
Where have they been for the four years? Biden was doing a great  job on himself by himself - now he’s been corraled, bipartially muted, and sedated, but they sent his lookalike out on  a bike!!??
This isn't to say Dukakis didn't blow a lead...but he didn't blow a 17-point lead.  He blew like a 5-point lead.  Also, Dukakis was a doofus.  Biden is not.  And Bush was not Trump :)
As usual trump has attempted to pull the curtains over his EO! Absolutely outrageous! We need to kick him out of office with a resounding vote for Biden!
And why, Queen Nancy, should I give a scat about what China wants? Look around you, the world is masked thanks to them. China wanting Biden is a ‘kiss of death’ to his candidacy. ‘Member, your ice cream is not made in China, but your mask is.

This seems to be part of Trump’s re-election plan. He is trying to make Biden out to be a radical leftist. It’s not going to work, most people know Biden’s record and what he wants to do.
Pay to play Biden.  No thanks. Switched to Republican,  voting Trump for my first time. Democrats are liars and cheats
Yep, and now Trump is doing the same. I also don’t have high hopes for the Biden administration.
Declassify the intellegence about Russia's interference in 2020 election now. We have a right to know what is going on. Sen Johnson's fake investigation into the Biden's needs to be translated from the original Russian from whence it came. Are u willing to sell out US for power?
Biden says some ofbthe most racist crap in the open and on live TV. This is the Mayor of Baltimore's reaction.   President Trump says "colored paper" and this same mayor would lose it.
If you are going to talk about  at all you need... you must give equal time to  ... or do you not believe she deserves to be heard. #LetHerSpeak she is a smart, talented, patriot and deserves to be heard.  Stop propping up creepy uncle racist joe Biden
I don't really have an opinion. I leave that to Joe Biden. Do you have a fav? Just curious.
That is one heckuva long dock. Hope the island is worth the walk. Maybe that’s where Biden is staying?
Going to Mass on Sunday and accepting communion does not a Catholic or Christian make. If a role model, you do not accept abortion or allow persecution of fellow Christians or decry religious traditions or tolerate injustice or profit from deceit or manipulate sinful acts. Biden!
Agreed. Frankly I am tired of all the attention to these rumors. I trust Joe Biden to make his own choice. It's personal he needs &amp; deserves to take however much time he needs. We already know he expects to choose a woman &amp; that's enough for me. Plus he will have a diverse cabnt.
Tell her if Biden gets elected maybe they can finally impeach Hilary. Hahaha.
They are going to push so hard for regime change in Venezuela if Biden wins.
Please take Biden’s place and run for President Andrew!  Yang gang can get it done. Joe can’t
The effect of cutting old and redundant regulations that have been on the books since the 1950s, and what this has done for the everyday person. Biden had 8 years to do that and did not.*Sleepy Joe Biden wants to know your location*
After the election (voting for Biden/Harris and no Republicans) I'm switching parties....
No it’s not. But if “better than trump” is the only other realistic choice, then as much as it sucks, that’s the one we have to pick. Or we can continue letting trump destroy this country. Your call. I detest biden but it’s not really a question to me.
“By the way, you know, I sit on the stand and it’d get hot. I got a lot of — I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun,” Biden said. “And the kids used to come up and reach in the pool and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again.” -Biden
Preach! Good riddance. If you're not willing to stand up for your country &amp; democracy, you probably think fouling the nest &amp; settling in somebody else's tidy nest is okay. 😬
Biden is supposedly targeting Texas — but you wouldn’t know it from Democratic convention lineup #SmartNews
I think Biden was told to say woman of color.
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his VP. Which I think choosing her as his VP was a really good choice. #Biden2020
You and jo biden need to go away.
Joe Biden in a nutshell
It’s ok to hate him, and still vote for him. It’s people who vote for Biden out of spite that puzzle me.

We need Biden’s follower numbers to go up!
Interesting take: Biden’s civility &amp; humanity show weakness, whereas the constant lying, misogyny &amp; racism coming out of trump’s mouth are considered strength. Only the GOP could come up with this twisted logic.
If you want a president who doesn’t like being pissed on by Las Vegas hookers, Joe Biden is your guy. #UrineTroubleTrump
Biden said that masks should be mandatory for everyone to wear when outside for 3 months! 😠
I say, Joe Biden is not my Boss. I do what I want!!
Well,  and  aren’t republican either. I think they’ll endorse Biden.
Let’s all just start following Biden and Harris’ lead and do the things they suggest, before they are even in office. We’re better off following their leadership and it just might make 45’s head explode. 😂🤣
Donnie, stop spreading the Fake News.  There are 11 swing states identified by    According to  polls Biden is winning 9 of those 11 most by sizable margins.
The stoopid, it burns. Great pick Biden.
You hate women! You’re threatened by smart women!
What do you have to say to your dad about this deplorable comment about women? We know how little he thinks of you
Is this to help Joe Biden?
I could see Biden doing 8 years and then Harris doing another 8 years
Biden and Harris are news.  Trump is not.
Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the “far left, socialist Democrats.” This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
You’re completely incapable of attacking Biden on issues so you have to resort to childish taunts. Sad
Not only that but I’m pretty sure Mr Biden is a catholic

It's Kamala: Biden Picks Harris as Running Mate -
If you are considering voting for the Green Party because you don't believe the Biden/Harris ticket is progressive enough, you are literally voting for Trump.  If you would like to discuss further, please ask Presidents Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.
PANTOMATH:  ENOUGH OF YOUR HATE TACTICS!!!  THEY WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE!!! HARRIS SUCKS WORSE THAN BIDEN!!! SHE IS HATED BY THE PEOPLE!!!!!!
I’m also a career woman living in the suburbs and am ecstatic about voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. I can’t wait to boot this racist out of office!
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
this you?
The only hesitation I had about Kamala Harris as VP is that I think she is better than that job will allow her to be and she won't be happy in it. But if Biden gives her a consequential role then maybe it will prepare her and the country for her as POTUS in '24.  (white lefty)
I bet she will blow Biden.
oh please by the time Biden gets elected he will pull a Harris and have a short time in office and we'll be stuck with kookie Kamala
As a former Californian, this is a very poor choice for Biden. She was picked based on color and not on her character. 🤦‍♂️
Biden should’ve picked Dark Magician as his VP
Absolutely love it! She's smart, tough and a great support for Biden. Couldn't have had a better pick! #BidenHarris2020
I am very happy that Ms. Harris is the pick! She's young, she's tough and she will be a great support to Biden! That's a winner!!!

I agree with  I was for you and then I read about you and then you went low during the primaries. My reasearch and your behavior is how you lost me. We need Trump out so my vote goes to Biden regardless of you as VP.
What if Biden tweeted. “LOL jK”
I don't think Biden's going to go for 8.
I was happy (relieved?) to vote for Joe. I’m ECSTATIC about the Biden/Harris ticket!!
12, if Biden steps down after 4, then she gets two terms.
Clearly, that was intended as a metaphor meaning that, with that sparring dynamic they showed, they displayed a lot of respect for each other, and that the ticket was going to be Biden/Harris at the end of the primary season.  If you can't read that into my tweet, *whatever*.
Biden could pick a cadaver for his running mate and I am still voting for him!
The VP Intro should be boring IMO. Drop the suspense, introduce the person, let the person speak to America. No drama. If you're the Biden campaign, the strategy here should be make America boring again.

Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
hey Sandra, did you ever see the speech where Biden said “poor kids are just as smart as white kids” that was 2 months ago. So to him every minority is “poor”. He also said he doesn’t want his kids &amp; grandchildren growing up in a “racial jungle”
Now you won't know whether it was your threat or his character that made the choice. A pity.   And any who see Trump and GOP for who they are and conjures up a reason not to vote for Biden are just choosing to bury themselves in the rubble Trump is making of America.
And the alt-leftist #Marxists think Joe Biden doesn't have cognitive decline.  #ScarecrowHasNoBrain
I don’t think Jesus supports abortion like Biden
These pictures/memes of rioters saying “this is Biden’s America” crack me up.... because... no it’s not? 😂
I don’t think Joe Biden will respond to threats. He is bigger than that.
Think it's safe to say he also wouldn't pardon trump-which makes this red-blooded voter *very* happy💪🇺🇸🤗
I noticed Joe Biden wasn't wearing one this weekend too. Kind of a bummer to see that.
Just about anyone would / should win 45 running against himself.  Biden's best best is to shut up and let Trump keep hurting himself.
Joe Biden is an old white man
Isn’t joe Biden an old white man?

What if Biden picks Ivanka as his running mate?
Kamala could care less minorities. She has that in common with Biden.If all the male and female homosexuals where to get put in jail  Joe Biden would have no one to vote for him............................
The only platform Joe Biden has is all the male and female homosexuals other than that Joe Biden dont have progressive platform
Any republican who votes for Joe Biden is a communist and a piss hole sucking butt bitch and trader to the republican party
If any of you vote for Joe Biden there is going to be another unwanted out brake of male and female homosexuals in the united states
You know what is good about a president he is not any mans or any woman's butt bitch and Joe Biden cant say that because Joe Biden is any persons butt bitch.................
Joe Biden is still Obama's piss hole sucking butt bitch
The whole time Joe Biden was in the white house all he did was suck on Obama's butt bitch turd hole
Because we need people to show up and vote, not think their vote won’t count or Biden has it in the bag.
That’s one of those countries Trump will say Joe Biden doesn’t know- because Trump doesn’t know.
I wonder if Kamala is gonna give Biden an N word pass
We need to wake up because if Biden becomes president this will be normal and he will say it is ok.  We have got to stand up for our freedoms before we lose them.  We can not expect others to do it for us.  God bless America and President Trump
By not debating the Great Potato in Chief (Tater trump) the "president" will claim that Joe Biden is afraid (too senile, uninformed, unintelligent, et al) to debate him. The Domestic Terrorist in Chief (Murder Bounties on American Soldiers) is not capable of debating Joe Biden.
Here’s there boy, Biden, and if elected will make great failures with the liberals a reality for America.  Nothing good for our country will happen with Biden/Harris!  ⁦ ⁦
Joe Biden is a registered pervert with his local county clerks office because he is democrat
Joe Biden is a communist butt bitch Democrat
Joe Biden is a lover of male and female homosexuals the fucking 4F-queer
I can’t stand how politicians aggressively criticize opponents but then team up with them after they lose. Like Trump insulting Ted Cruz’s wife. Bernie and Kamala loving Joe Biden now. If someone didn’t do this shit, they probably would be president themselves
She would only run in 24 if Biden didn’t run for a second term. So most likely looking at a 2028 campaign.
Me convincing people to vote for Biden in November:
At least, either Biden/Harris or Harris/Biden, we will have a President and not an extension of Putin's dick.
Biden picks Kamala.  Trump gonna dump pence and add Omarosa
So much for Lying late in the game. MAGAt hats are made in China. Ivanka (Mrs. Ferret) has a butt-load of Chinese Trademarks and Sweat-shops  When Joe Biden wins in November America will be able to start cleaning the stain of the trump Crime Family from our Nation.  No more Lies.
Biden website redesign is good.
Obviously Biden/Harris is a infinitely better option than Trump, anyone who thinks otherwise is rolling in privilege. But "just doing her job" is not a good defense, especially when the job is law enforcement.
Hell yea!!!! Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden's running mate is a cop.  I did not see that coming.
Trump says Americans will have to learn Chinese if Biden wins
Biden picking Harris shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone
I’m more amazed by CNN’s cognitive dissonance than I am concerned about Biden’s cognitive deterioration.
Biden/wine moms
Don't listen to the hype.  The Domestic Terrorist in Chief cannot close the USPS, defund SSA (Medicare nor Medicaid), nor stop Vote By Mail by himself. The Putin Party Members (Republicans) are not going to help him with that in an Election Year.  Biden will win.
2/  And Joe Biden hasn't received any of Putin's Murder Bounties on American Soldiers.  Explain to us how wonderful the Putin Party (Republicans) is while you are Golfing and denigrating BLM and posing with The Book in front of a Church you have darkened the door of 1 or 2 times.TRUMP SUPPORTERS made this trending to make Biden’s supporters look bad.

. . . they'd had in reserve for Elizabeth Warren and Susan Rice.  Look, I'm aware that Vice President Biden has some questionable issues in his past.  Guess you're glad you have a sterling, pristine figure like donald to support, huh? A real Norman Rockwell type.

The president has used baseless voter fraud claims to justify his continued reluctance to fund the postal service ahead of the election.
Biden is under no obligation to do anything that doesn't help him in the campaign. Yes, Trump destroyed norms, and some of them are probably gone for good. That's not Biden's fault. Blaming good people for the actions of bad is part of the problem with the media.

What Harris Got from Biden During Her Job Interview  via
On the same day Joe Biden accepts the Democratic presidential nomination, President Donald Trump will assail the former vice president from his hometown.
The effort to instill fear in voters about a future Biden presidency began the same day Kamala Harris joined his ticket.
I'm so happy to see the positive, competent campaign of Biden and Harris. Inspiring!
Going extreme-left after this current administration would be a disaster.  That doesn't mean I particularly like Biden (&amp; I will say that over &amp; over), but we need to rebuild a sustainable infrastructure (domestically &amp; internationally) from this rubble. Moderates make for good
Come on, folks. Come visit this person's tweet, and tell him/her why YOU are voting for Biden and Harris. Make sure not to use the word "Trump" - apparently s/he finds that word offensive.
Because several people I know, starting with my elderly mother wo is over 80 and has Alzheimer's, depend on Social Security, which is under threat by current policies, which candidate Biden promises to reverse.  Sorry to have made you wait so long.
Wear a facemask with a BIDEN button pinned to it, and a clothespin clipped to the mask to show that you're holding your nose in order to vote for Biden.  VOTE for Biden - otherwise, you ARE voting for donald, whether you're voting for someone else, or just sitting on your ass.
how well did his promise to spend billions on Biden work out
This is so what we need: Net Zero is now mainstream! #ClimateAction #GreenRecovery #FossilFree
This is awesome.  I actually like Biden a bit more than a mask, but if you are in this position, I can respect your POV.
But note that I'm much more opposed to Biden in general, I just also don't think that Harris was a good pick for VP - for a candidate who has NOT been accused of sexual harassment, see Jo Jorgensen:
What “light” are you talking about? You spelled Biden wrong; it’s spelled T r u m p.
Vote for Biden
The second reason is they wanted to disrespect blk ppl bc that is the southern stategy is to through political sneak shots or straight in your face diss shots. And to replace Biden with her

...with enough money to remain functional, not just the ones  with legislatures loyal to the President's party, Biden will ensure that all states will be able to keep their people indoors until there are very few contagious cases remaining. This is what was done in every . . .
1) donald believes in running government like a business. Fortunately, Biden believes in running government like a government. He will open negotiations with Congress to organize a lockdown, which, yes, will cost money. THIS time, the money will be spent wisely, instead of . . .
Joe Biden thinks that "Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum".   I think Joe Biden should take off his face mask so he can get more oxygen into his brain.
Um, your comment is hard to follow, perhaps due to your doing arithmetic the way Republicans do it when they control the Federal budget. You seem to be claiming that snakes are ducks, so more people would be dead if Biden had been President for the last four years. I doubt it.
I would rather COVID-19 spread under Biden the way H1N1 spread under Obama/Biden than the way COVID-19 spread under donald.
First thing Biden is going to do when in the Oval is strengthen the nepotism guidelines at the WH.
This is what you get as a black person under Biden and Harris laws and enforcement
If Biden didn’t need the black vote and  then Roland Martin wouldn’t be ranting about black voter to black voters or to everybody else
Remember whe Roland Martin was like black voters are the smartest when he said they shut Hilary down for being insincere for the crime bill now he’s mad that it’s happening to Biden. What a hypocrit. Remember he said the crime bill and black voters is what shit Hilary down.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

Let me remind y’all he seriousness this has to be. Aipac want blk ppl gone ws want the same both represent either white isreal and white america both oppose blk ppl. Both endorses Biden and kamala. Both caused harmed to blk ppl but yet it’s the blk dems who keep defending them.
Now Comes the Difficult Work of Pushing the Biden-Harris Ticket Left
It should be no surprise Kamala Harris has been chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate. From her career-long pursuit of right-wing goals to her flexibility with the truth, the two are remarkably similar politicians.

You're the news guy. What's the story? If you're talking about Biden you might check into a thunderstorm and a generator.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
True, although in the main post they say Biden is favored to win
I can understand that, Biden is a disappointing option to say the least, but donald is so much more than the greater of two evils - he is truly evil incarnate. He was famously rated 45th out of 45 Presidents. Personally, I rank him 46th, below Jefferson Davis.
Trump Says Biden Insulted Every Man On Earth By Choosing Female Running ...  via  Wonderful! I love it! "It's actually pretty okay to insult THOSE men, because they're assholes!" Yes!
On cnn they announced that the confidence in the polices quote “it is the lowest it has been since three decades ago.” Wonder why because 3 decades ago guess who’s been making the laws on crime Biden
Just remember blk ppl didn’t pick her or joe Biden. The fact joe one in a swing state was bc of one blk person and overwhelming a bunch of whites in sc. fact there’s no blk agenda in this country pick just white ones with poc face.
I think Biden/Harris is an awful ticket, but I'll vote for them, encourage my friends/family to vote for them, and do whatever it takes to get them into office.  But they're just so bad.
JUST IN: Tim Kaine responds to Kamala Harris being picked as Joe Biden's...  via  be prepared for whitefolks to keep saying this bc this is how political correctness works the drill the lie In you’re head from a hundred different directions
Something I've noticed on social media since Biden picked his VP is the number of white people complaining vs BIPOC being relieved/excited. It feels like I'm seeing a lot of white people not willing to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, which seems...like a cop out honestly?
More like the klansman and hitler. Biden in hitler for blk ppl trump is racist but a selfish one he only cares for himself really. Trump does what he does to hide the fact that he’s passing laws really for himself and his properties
Liberal pundits are touting Joe Biden as a potentially transformative president in the mold of FDR. His donor lists — and his own words — say otherwise.
Vice President Biden choosing a woman of color to run against donald and Mike Pence is an interesting definition of "safe", considering the record U.S. voters have, which suggests very strongly that racism is still a big problem, and misogyny may be an even bigger one.
What Joe Biden's historic selection of Kamala Harris tells us about how he would govern
Rep. Karen Bass is no socialist, but she's hung around a few of us in the past. Because of this, as her name was floated for Biden's vice presidency, she's been subjected to McCarthyist-style smears. We on the Left have to clearly and loudly stand against
On Tuesday, Joe Biden finally announced his running mate. Here’s what our panelists think about the choice
Harris and Biden’s late son were longtime allies, helping to cement the relationship behind the Democratic ticket
"The United States urgently needs a leader who will have the courage to look at, think hard about, and speak openly about the dire perils posed by our country's vast nuclear arsenal."
"All of us will need to do everything we can do defeat Donald Trump this November, and Joe Biden will need strong progressive energy to win," said the PCCC in response.
Biden's selection of the California senator comes after Wall Street executives made clear that they would prefer "almost anyone" but Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Despite decades in government, Joe Biden remains less sharply defined to voters than previous presidential nominees.
Harris is the third woman in U.S. history to be named as a vice-presidential candidate for a major political party.
Andrew Yang in Joe Biden Administration?  via  Biden should roll out his entire Cabinet and send them out to campaign as his proxies, to provide contrast  to the corruption and incompetence of donald's swamp dwellers.
Like...if the Biden/Harris ticket does win, I'm not expecting a whole lot of changes. I expect Obama-lite (and even Obama was pretty moderate, tbh) form Biden/Harris.  Basically, I'm not expecting a major cultural shift from that ticket. But..it's still better than Trump..sooo..
I personally feel like Kamala Harris was probably one of the worse choices Biden could have made for VP but she’s sill better than the complete trash that is Trump/Pence.   She’s referred to as a cop for a reason and with BLM I feel like that was a big miscalculation on Biden.
"Joe Biden can go suck a dick... Maybe of we all agree to behave ourselves maybe we don't need a president" - My mother  Ladies, Gentlemen and Everyone In Between, I think I did it.
Going to focus on the tremendous news of Ilhan Omar winning today's primary.  And, yes, you self-righteous, bloviating, performative nags; of course I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris, because anything is better than Trump. But the Biden/Harris ticket suuuuucks.
I'm ok w/ the choice of Kamala Harris as VP running mate for Biden. I''m still not a Biden fan, but I definitely feel more comfortable voting for Biden/Harris than, say, Biden/Whitmer.  I would have felt MUCH more comfortable voting for Harris/Warren or Warren/Harris, but..well..
Well that interview was a rambling train wreck! You have really lost your friggin mind!!  Think you best lay off Mr. Biden as it just causes us to look at your mental state more closely.  You sound desperate and nutty! 🤪🤪
It's bizarro world where a Trump ad makes a good point about Joe Biden as a candidate.
in case anybody is wondering biden is gonna choose a running mate this week
Any reasonable candidate should be kicking Trump's ass in Swing States... yet here we are, with Biden barely holding a lead in most of them by only 2 points.
There *may* be times were voting 3rd party or similar (but NOT not voting as protest) is justifiable, but now is not one of them.   Biden and hopefully the Dems getting the House and Senate are the only chance of things getting better right now.
I don't like Biden or Harris, but as horrific as things are now, they only get much worse if Trump gets another term.   In my voting life I have gone back and forth on "vote strategically" vs "if you vote for the lesser of two evils nothing will change"...
She’s beside herself with joy over Kamala Harris. No, she’s not with joy, she IS Joy!  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenKamala2020 #Kamala #Biden #BidenHarris #KamalaHarris #ForThePeople #AMJoy #JOY
Biden shouldve picked Tulsi.
We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) take  +  to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
1 more thing: We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) Take Joe + Kamala to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
I'm all in for Biden-Harris for the obvious reason that Trump is a uniquely cruel and incompetent moron. But the fact that Republicans are already smearing these two standard liberals as "far left radicals" reveals how stupid it was to not elect *actually progressive* candidates.
harris was the safest bet for biden and it shows 🤧 no like no like no like
Finally. I had enough of him Biden his time.
This is a great choice!
The fact that you're still screeching "Both sides do it! Both sides do it! Raw-awk! Polly wanna cracker!" tells me all I need to know about how highly developed your perceptions of U.S. political culture are. Thinking that there's no difference between donald &amp; Joe Biden...? SMH
I try not to comment too much on politics in this Twitter account, but I can't remain silent here.POTUS is trying to gin up support by stoking racism. He is spewing sinophobic, fearmongering lies. This is not OK. We need to be better than this.  162 days.
Interesting Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate.  I need to ponder this.
and the team saw this coming months ago...
a biden and kamala democratic ticket?
I agree that he should not raid the Senate for Secretary of Commerce. I consider Biden’s VP to be the 2024 front runner, so I think it’s worth it in CA.
Oh, I see your point too, now. She could indeed work on cleaning up the lawlessness Trump has injected into the gov't.... Though the DOJ might be better for that... the optics of a WoC for VP are too important for Biden right now though
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. Let's do this, and kick the orange bastard and his sycophantic second out of office in the biggest landslide in US history.
You sure about that? Biden has a wide lead, and Harris is popular. More than likely, Dumpy is shitting his pants right now.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Biden makes his choice
2020 has gone in such a way that I'm fairly certain any moment I'm going to get a news alert that Biden chose Sarah Palin as his VP candidate.
Therefore they will never blame the cause bc they are the cause. Joe Biden will never back down from his bill that he made so why not hold him accountable for his sins that he caused unto black ppl.
So if Joe Biden HAS TO pick a black woman for veep, doesn't that mean Obama failed at being the first black president? Obama was supposed to be the savior of black America, I remember Jesse Jackson's tears of joy on that victory night in Chicago. Now look at Chicago.
Bc morning joe never speaks on the greedy truth of history. Think about how they discuss joe Biden as if he isn’t racist as if his pass doesn’t exist. Now I may not like trump but if your going to talk about somebody when you’re doing the same is called hypocritical bs
When I watch the white media I be having this sense of notion that they’re deflecting. How by using every little thing trump do to deflect the real racism that biden can’t keep coming out his mouth. I hear morning joe call trump ignorant of history this is rhetorical
The reason I keep bringing up democracy being white supremacy is bc what happens when the majority of the majority want you dead or enslaved  prison. You’ll get ppl like reagan Nixon Clinton Obama trump and Biden no matter which side you vote on ws is not only going to be there
Biden call blk ppl predators and the dems got blk women thinking that Biden is a match made in heaven smh. Wake up. Don’t be crazy and do the samething over and over again expecting different results.

U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California and former national security adviser Susan Rice, both Black, are among the top contenders.
Environmentalists are floating potential cabinet picks, hoping to pressure Biden to take on the fossil fuel industry.
Patriotic, devout are not positives. A bunch of the others pretty questionable terms to apply to Biden... still, a lot better than Trump, and what we have available at this point, so
Biden is going to pick a woman; that’s what he said. I assume he will also select his cabinet members and may introduce them all to us already. This way he will be able to hit the ground running should he win. Oh God, I can’t wait. Let it be!
Thank you! I hate to use this phrase, but “it is what it is.” I just have to go with the flow and hope that Biden wins and 45* gets kicked to the curb. It would give me hope again, which I’m utterly lacking since the 2016 election of the orange dicktator.
87% of Democrats support "Medicare for All," though Joe Biden doesn't

If Biden wins the presidency, he’ll face strong pressure to move on in the name of national unity. He’ll have to resist.
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday called President Trump’s executive order to cut payroll taxes “a reckless war on Social Security.”

If Joe Biden wants to signal his commitment to the message of the Black Lives Matter movement, he shouldn’t pick a former police officer or prosecutor.

Done!
Followed all. Thanks!!
Well cnn hust said Biden have to apologize everytime he speak. Lol this is so true. Bc everytime he speak he always happen to say something racist.
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.Trump is older than Biden, and Biden leads a healthier lifestyle. Your worries are misplaced. Also, if the worst happens, we have Kamala Harris.
Man I wish they would have let Biden stick his foot in his mouth for the millionth time! Mr. Gaff machine is going to go down hard in the debates. Funny how he’s no longer a racist/sexist like Kamala said he was in the Dem debates. 🤔
Many of Biden's questions were prearranged.
More people will roll their eyes at Trump’s digital content than will watch any convention coverage from either side. #Trump #Biden
Eric Trump calls on Biden to answer for 'very discriminatory' process of picking running mate
Clearly, Biden is right.  Otherwise we would be open like so many other countries that have handled this better than we did.  Given the fact we have 25% of the worlds deaths this hasn’t been handled by Mr. whine baby.
What about making the A in Harris into a star to compliment the stripes of Biden E?
Biden work's for china. NOT USA.
Most progressive tax plan in history, most progressive clean energy plan in history, and actually addressing covid. It’s either Biden or Trump. Last election Jill Stein split the dem vote by 4% and trump won. It’s literally the lesser of two evils, if you wanna call it that

If it is true that Tammy Duckworth was only turned down for VP because Biden's people feared a challenge over her being born abroad, then the fascists are well and truly winning.
Blacks were right to be mad about Biden's "You ain't black" comment. Even those that are house n**gers don't want to hear it pointed out. Look at these white conservatives, these house wiggers. They couldn't be more despicable if they were literally "yess massa"ing Trump.
There is something that is very irritating about Kamala Harris. I don't think she will help Biden at all.

Umm we’re already a laughingstock because of you. When Biden wins, we’ll prove to the world that America has some decency and compassion
The dogwhistles have become klaxons because they pretty much have nothing else. Biden/Harris is Republican Lite. How the fuck do you attack their policy ideas and have it come across as being in good faith? Everybody and their grandma knows this isn't a Bernie/Warren ticket.
Trump was attacking Warren for years. He saw her as a guaranteed opponent. Rice had built-in Obama baggage. Neither wound up on the ticket at all, and I think that's left them a bit scrambly.  They knew it'd be Biden, but they're acting like this ticket was out of nowhere.
don't get me wrong the same would be true of many other possible choices, but like, it seems to me they had a whole fucking gameplan for Warren or Rice and didn't think Biden/Harris was a real thing for some reason
I’m glad Biden is speaking plainly about this.
Biden just lost the election.
Good morning Erica/ everyone. I’m still celebrating Harris and Biden. I’m hoping next term. She can run for president it’s time  for change. Conservatives should just move to an island. I love kamala ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fucktard is a LOOSER! He’s always been a LOOSER! Being a LOOSER is the reason he’s suppressing voter access. Because the LOOSER knows he can’t beat a REAL LEADER, so he has to cheat! Biden, like Obama, are “WINNERS!” Fucktard, the LOOSER, can’t beat “WINNERS” fairly!  LOOSER! FU!
Just another MOM voting for BIDEN &amp; HARRIS 2020!
Are you stumping for Biden/Kamala now? Damn right she was!
Every single one of these is a free campaign ad for Biden/Harris.
I think it's a reference to Herman Cain tweeting some stuff against Biden/Harris?
That’s billshit and you know it. This isn’t even Joe Biden tweeting. We’ve got your number.
Good lord! You’re tds is really out of hand. If you actually care about joe Biden, the person, the humane thing would be for him to step down.  Why is his family humiliating him like this?
Does it really matter? Trump is the President today. He has to run on HIS record. Biden is his opponent. He has to answer for some but not all of the Obama administration. If Trump could manage to NOT LIE we might have a real contest! But, Trump just can’t keep from lying! SAD!!!
Why, what are you trying to hide, Mr Kristol? If Biden is not mentally or cognitively able to do something as simple as have a debate, the American people deserve to know about it before the elections.
biden said desegregation would result in a "racial jungle" and kamala tried to keep people imprisoned longer to use them for cheap labor. so you've got a segregationalist rapist and a transphobic cop who supports prison slavery
hey, how much time have you spent canvassing or making calls for biden? if you want him to win so badly, maybe you should do something about it? or do you just treat politics like a team sport that you spectate?
You own daughter is voting for Biden/Harris, loser.
I bet video editing is a hit job in both Trump campaign and Joe Biden‘s campaign. Seriously it’s true.
Look at the statement by Biden. He stated Trump said they (white supremacists) were "very fine people." That is absolutely not true. Even Jake Tapper said it isn't true. You may want to listen to the entire Trump statement before making that reference.
This isn't about Obama/Biden. They handled it so well that we didn't need masks, etc. Sit down &amp; shut up.
There's something truly exceptional about the idea that a Harris/Biden presidency would be worse for whites than Adelson/Trump. Private prison operators don't care about the Color of Convicts. They probably prefer less troublesome whites, all told.
“Biden bro” is absolutely perfect and beautifully ironic, imma start using that
As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly jazzed about Biden either
I bet Biden-Harris are very dependent on the age bracket 18-24 yr olds if they want even the slimmest of chances to win...
Oh yes. I actually listened. It was a *trip*--especially after the coherent, non-crazy Biden-Harris event.
Definitely voting Biden/Harris ticket!
Now watch the press grill Biden/Harris over innuendo and conspiracy
As I jam out to  before the Biden/Harris live stream, I think about how republicans have next to zero iconic music they can use because everyone hates them and I laugh and laugh. #DoYouBelieveInLifeAfterLove
He can talk to Biden and fix it w/o airing dirty laundry publically. Solutions, not griping! We need to shed light on all minorities that are underrepresented, 💯 agree. Shaming on twitter doesn’t seem like the way to do that, IMO.
When climate activists who know damn well that Biden/Harris means another decade without meaningful climate legislation are talking about the music choice for their press conference, any hope for real change is dead. Gone. Buried and eaten by worms already.
January bullshit: Toxic Twitter fans But we'll be labeled as far-left He and Warren are OVER  August reality: KHive VP Biden is labeled socialist Articles talking about Biden debating Warren as if Bernie's first choice for VP wasn't always Warren  Good job everyone, you killed us
1. I don't believe Warren was a real consideration  2. I don't believe Biden would make his choice based on a gaffe  3. It doesn't matter either way. It's not like Warren VP = Biden pro-M4A.  It's Nazi vs. Republican Lite. That's the choice. It was always going to be this.
Oh and Biden/Harris is coming for ya
Not sure if I’m more annoyed that the DNC chose Biden over Bernie/the other options. Or that Biden chose Kamala over the other options. 😔
Joe biden is delusional. Tell me why u think hes “not”
I would put money Biden serves a term if he wins the election
These idiot republicans will bitch and moan because Biden will be forced to raise taxes. He should raise them only on the wealthy and corporations. Repeal the tax deal.
#KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris First smart decision made by Biden. I hope it’s the start of an ever climbing trend of his.
What? Deliberate mistreatment of white/H*sp**ic kids to make certain other groups look better? But I thought this would only happen under the Biden plan, not under Trump in Republican Florida? NOOOOOOOO #KAGA #MAGA #WWG1WGA #PromisesMadePromisesKept #StormisuponUS
JFC. Joe Biden really can't get over this "You ain't black" schtick, can he? In this case, "You ain't black (ADOS)"
please note Biden picked an attack dog running mate. Beware of off the cuff televised comments. Repercussions can be legal actions. No simple approach. Biden is the candidate, she is riding the shirt tail
I hear y'all but at some point there is a lesser of two evils. Biden might not make all of the changes we hope to see but anything is better than the motherfucker in there now. The house is already blue and the senate probably will be too. Change has to start somewhere
😅😅😂😂🤣😂😆Here we go again😅😆😂😆😂😂😂😂😆😆😅😂😆Russia, give it up. It worked once, but REAL, TRUE Americans aren’t buying it this time!🤣😆😆😅😆🤣🤣Fuck you.😅🤣🤣😅President Biden won’t be “Putin” America first, like your puppet did.  Fear Biden like you feared Obama!
Great Wall fucktard, (as long as the wind doesn’t blow!)  Mexico want’s it finished too, so people from this “shit-hole” country can’t get in their country! How embarrassing is that!  Make America great again! 😆😆😂🤣😆😆🤣🤣😅🤣🤣😆 Let’s leave that up to Biden &amp; Harris!
you bring new hope and promise for the future. Future POTUS Biden made an excellent choice!

This is what getting ratioed looks like. Also, who knew that Linds would be stumping for Biden/Harris? So good!
Look! Linds is stumping for Biden/Harris now! Hahaha!
This ad is so funny! The name- calling 4th grade bully for Pres? No thanks! I Love the Biden/Harris 2020 ticket!
Absolutely John. You are a great man that fought for our freedom. You shall always be loved me my dear friend. You are an actual hero that fought. I’m proud to call you my. You fought for all of us. So proud you stand with Biden and Harris. You are a great man .👍
Trump says if Joe Biden wins election you have to study Chinese😂 you are way ahead of them.
Color me shocked—you are blatantly trying to get your racist followers to vote for Mr. Biden now?
I absolutely agree 199% Erica. It’s time for change. The past will never end with out new direction. The rightest conservatives like old fashion values. In fact even before women’s rights to vote. They don’t like change.. time to change everything. Biden/ Harris 2020😀👍
You don’t know that. For those that love  and I contributed to her campaign, our goal should be to get her elected as senate majority leader and replace Schumer. Then her platform is Independant of Biden....
“I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,” - Joe Biden
Willie Brown who has an affair with her advised Biden not to pick her. She was 29 at the time while Brown was in his 60s.
What’s your point?  I love the fact she wants to save the planet.  Biden will replace lost jobs with green jobs.  So, no worries.
I agree. I wish Biden &amp; Harris well; they're brave souls. I'm in shock as to where America is today. The fascists are here &amp; well integrated, it would seem.  PDX was a trial. I think PDX won.  trump withdrew w/o a problem. It was a battle; they aren't finished.  I'm proud of PDX
Yes those voters definitely will be turned off. Biden probably chose her because her past would be well received by independents/moderates who are unsure of progressive policies but don’t want Trump. They expect those angry on the left to still vote for Biden
I’m very happy with the pick. She’s young with experience. I really think the pick was based on change. I’m really happy. Great pick joe. Let’s put Trump and his scared of trump little man pence to rest. Horrible leadership. Biden /Harris want change. Conservatives.. new times.
I was really hoping for her to take the AG post. But she'll be great no matter what she does. Any bets on who Biden will choose for AG? Maybe Sally Yates?
Honest question. Do you think the Biden choice of Harris as his VP this will strengthen down ballot chances in the senate?
A tool in the service of White Wellbeing is never illegitimate.  Vote Biden/Harris for what they will do.     #MAGA #GoingFree #Biden2020 #Harris2024
Biden-Harris in 2020!! I'm so excited to vote for the Democratic ticket again!
Oh no doubt about that. I think she is a solid choice (in general) for VP, although I expected her to be the main choice for AG for a Biden administration
congratulations!  What a great pick.  You two will make a great team.  Haven’t been this happy in a long time.  Biden and you give me hope for the country.  Nice job Joe!
MANY, MANY!  There will be a place for them in the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Their talents will be needed to clean up trump's aftermath.  They'll gain more experience and run for POTUS in the future!  (women age better than men, so we have a LONG list.  LOL)
I couldn’t be any happier. We have a fighting chance to end all this madness and division of the trump clan. So tired of trump saying the virus will go away. I want to hear facts. Biden/ Harris 2020. Very proud and hopeful. Let’s get this moron out.
What do I want to see in a Biden/Harris presidency? -COVID19 eradication -Respect for the science/research -Aid for struggling Americans -Aid for schools &amp; teachers -Tear down that damn Wall! -Release the children in cages -No more lies, no more bullshit -Women are human beings.
I hate Joe Biden and I hate Kamala Harris and I hate that there's a fucking Nazi in power that makes Joe Biden look remotely decent by comparison and I hate having to vote for abusers to get rid of abusers and I hate the Republican party and I hate billionaires and I hate cops.
There will be changes.  We have to have our ppl positioned &amp; that's what we get w Biden/Harris.  ...&amp; there is a great team w them... Warren, Porter, Rice, Abrams, , THIS is our year!  The GOP will fight dirty &amp; ugly.  We keep our heads high &amp; don't cave &amp; we'll win!

People are excited about Kamala Harris joining Biden? Couldn’t be me tf
Biden's store server has crashed so not everyone is disappointed it seems. Don't let your echo chamber get you down.
I'm very happy for  As much as I wish to have seen her as an amazing AG, she'll do an outstanding job as VP. I'm sure most of Biden's former Dem opponents will have seats in his cabinet. Here's to dumping  and his criminal administration.
It was inevitable when Klobuchar pulled out. I wouldn't be surprised if Biden decided then and decided to string us all along for a bit.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the prison and military industrial complex, marijuana staying criminalized, militarized police and a shitty healthcare Don’t let anyone shame you for not voting for this centrist republican

Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
How do y’all feel about Kamala Harris being Biden’s pick for VP ?
Toaster\ orange juice. I despise Biden and Harris but at least the have an IQ higher than 14. Once in a while Harris does the right thing.
Seeing a lot of the expected backlash, but I'll say it again: if Harris on the ticket gets #MedicareForAll on the platform, the margin of victory for Biden is going to be absurd.
KAMALA it is!!!   Biden/Harris - a winning ticket!!
She's well-positioned to help Biden advocate firm law enforcement.
every person on the left right now is writing some version of this joke:  the people: we need health care, climate change is a beeotch, fuck these cops  joe biden: tbd on health care, we'll see about climate change, here's kamala to tell you why cops are dope
Congratulations  Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party  via
What if Biden picks a woman for whom you have little fondness?
Biden/Harris? Ugh whatever. Better than Condoleezza Rice. Let’s just get this shitshow over with already
She’ll have Bill Barr’s head on a platter in to time! Great choice “President Joe Biden!”
If it means that Joe Biden is are next president and Trump and his criminal administration and their cronies are out and in jail, I would be happy to pay 98% in taxes.
like Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP. A LOT.  I can't wait for her to take it Trump and Pence. I know she has some baggage - all candidates (all people) do - but she'll make a great VP and would be a great president.
Well, he picked one of the few people on the list who supports SOME kind of Medicare For All, and he picked someone who won't bring built-in GOP Smear Machine ammunition.  I'm pleasantly surprised Biden didn't fuck that up.
Huge- finally- it is Kamala for VP. Biden tweeted it!
Biden can choose Nichols if he looks to reach out to Republicans; Saira Rao if he decides he needs to excite the woke crowd.
I like that ticket about equally as much as Biden/Duckworth. I think Tammy would be the better VP but Harris would be the better political choice and can definitely grow to fit the role.
I'm so tired of this VP edition of the bachelorette. Unless Biden 1) chooses Warren and then 2) dies I don't caaaaaaaaaaaaare
Biden should pick  for vp.
Biden has picked a female running mate.  Excited ......
Why not? All partners get a chance to make a speech. Jill Biden is quite an amazing woman.
Biden will be there on the last night, as most nominees do.
I did!   Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Joe has hairy legs! Joe Biden! You know the thing! Come on man!
Apparently Joe Biden is a fucking victim now. What did he ever do to you? I mean aside from rape, imprison, drone strike, bomb, rob, shoot, shackle, &amp;/or spy on you. Those are all lifestyle choices. Joe self-identifies as a political forest fire &amp; he needs a safe space to burn in
And when the woke are pulling Joe Biden’s strings, Israel and Jews will get screwed.
Is the magic money tree in Joe Biden’s basement?
“Advance liberal causes” your bio says. Dissing Biden’s possible choices does opposite. Many candidates have stocks and sit on boards that they divest themselves from when/if elected. This reporting earns you a block from this longtime liberal.
I know a lot of Biden voters who are so “excited” to vote they have had trouble sleeping for 3 years.
Biden wouldn't run away like #BunkerBitch did.

I disagree. She doesn’t regret what she did as a Bush staffer.  What I respect is her ability to use her inside knowledge of actual proper White House activity and contrast it with today’s chaos. She tells it like it is. Geo. Wills left the GOP and is voting for Biden. It’s ok!
I agree. My car would get keyed or set afire out driving in rural areas. But I do have a “In my America love wins... “ yard sign on my driveway and so do my lovely neighbors. We will all have Biden signs on our road in Fall.
Anthony Scaramucci is an obnoxious Never Trumper Republican who is supporting Joe Biden yet denies Joe Biden will do any of the things in the Democrat platform. So delusional!
I was just saying kind of opposite to my spouse. I see stupid-big trucks w/ huge trump flags and merch flying down street. I never see the sensible Dems do that for Biden. But that is a good thing. They are activists not maniacs.
so literally every single thing they're saying about biden is what they'd have said about bernie only we'd get all the good policy ok cool just checking
so, IMHO, the best we can hope for from electoral politics is Biden picks Kamala Harris and maybe one day comes around to adopting some whittled-down final bill based on her sorta-Medicare for All plan  lol it's not as bad as him picking Hillary I guess?
It's worth pointing out that Whitmer met with Biden in-person a week ago. While Rice has been all over the media lately, Kamala has been Biden's BFF and Duckworth is quite popular among the pundits, Whitmer is flying in under the radar.
I think Bass is eliminated based on the Scientology video's bad optics + the reluctance of the Biden campaign to do anything to please progressives (many have urged him to pick her).  Warren &amp; Clinton I rule out because they're announced already for the night the VP pick speaks.
so with that, I'm predicting it now:  Elizabeth Warren is not going to be Joe Biden's VP.
the two people announced as speakers on the night announced as "the night Joe Biden's VP pick addresses the nation" are Warren and Hillary Clinton  the most likely scenario is it is neither one of those two women.  if it is, would you REALLY expect him to pick Warren?
the Axios article gives me reason to believe that there is absolutely no way that Elizabeth Warren is going to be Joe Biden's VP pick
MSNBC needs to STFU about the Biden Campaign being "late" to pick a VP! VP picks usually don't happen until the convention so just fucking stop it!
I'm gonna beat joe biden.mp4
Warren and Clinton are confirmed to be speaking next Wednesday.  That's the night Biden's VP addresses the nation.  I have a feeling it's neither of them, but if it is? Lord.
If this is accurate it is difficult to understand the ignorance of the electorate regarding the current issues. This seems to be entirely the influence of the mainstream fake news media - Trump is bad, hydroxychloroquine kills, Biden is smart, the Green New Deal is good. WRONG!
It's the other way around. tRump* can't handle a debate. He can't handle the truth. Biden is fine. Some people confuse his stuttering for mental decline....which it is not. He has had to deal with stuttering his entire life.
We MUST STOP The Left from Stealing this Election. In 2016 they knew 100% Hillary had this Locked down. They WILL NOT make that mistake again. They have Enough Blank Ballots to Win this for Biden 3 times over. PLEASE Leader's Get On This Like Month's Ago. They're going cheat.
It’s also funny (and by funny I mean sickening) listening to middle aged democrats telling a young WOC (&amp; survivor) that she’s supposed to ignore all this damning evidence about Joe Biden because “the other guy’s worse and if you don’t vote for him, you’re electing Trump”
Joe Biden is so fucking creepy and incompetent and corrupt I just honestly don’t know if I can vote him still. I probably will, but this is the man who said he would VETO MEDICARE FOR ALL EVEN IF THE HOUSE AND SENATE PASSED IT!! In the middle of a pandemic.
-Steal the election by making it safe to vote? We have vote-by-mail in Oregon, and it works. No fraud. -Honey, EVERYONE endorses Biden. -Black Lives Matter &amp; Pelosi are not Marxists. -A Patriot is someone who will help get that POS out of the People's House.   Stop with the lies.
hate to break it to the liberals but donald trump isn't going to wilt at the sight of the majesty of joe biden's flex pose
Who tf is Biden’s running mate gonna be?! He said he would announce it the first week of August. Well....it’s now into the second week #Biden 🤔 COME ON ALREADY!
That's your misfortune. Most of us are going to vote that jackass out before he totally destroys everything we hold dear in this country. Joe Biden struggled with a stuttering problem his entire life. Don't be a Donald and make fun of him.

Joe Biden may be our first president chosen by affirmative action. No one would give even half a fuck about the old racist if he didn't faintly smell of Obama, and Obama only picked him for VP to be his designated token white geezer to chill the Clintonites.
Man, Biden and Trump on The Portal, or the Rubin Report, that would be incredible.
The Republican parry has effectively convinced half of America that democrats are socialists, when in reality most democrats are centrists. Obama, Hillary, and Biden are all centrist/moderates who have been called socialists and leftists. People have no idea what leftist means

Strong evidence indicates that both Biden and Trump are racist. However, there are degrees of racism. Biden is at least in good part a multi-cultural liberal, like selecting Kamala. Trump has projected the Central Park 5 and Obama as a black threat.
I am very concerned. Social Security is the institutional manifestation of our America being a community. Biden-Harris is the ticket
#TheNewNewFrontier As Biden said the other day, our America's promise can be summed up in one word: possibilities. Standing on the shoulders of our venerable ancestors, amazing things are possible for us. Let us doggedly pursue the American dream
Problem is I don’t trust information we are getting from postal union supporting Biden and I don’t trust Trump administration.
Swallow your craziness and vote for Biden or kiss everything goodbye...
NOBODY is as awful as Trump says they are. Biden is not as bad as Republicans say he is. Trump is far worse than Republicans will admit he is.

Trump is trying to kill us. Biden and Kamala are trying to save us.
President Trump attacks Joe Biden for calling governors to mandate all Americans wear masks for the next three months, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of politicizing an issue Trump himself has used for political gain in recent months.
I'm a boomer, so I remember a long way back. Biden &amp; Harris aren't perfect candidates, nobody is. But they are SO MUCH  BETTER than Trump and Pence, it is hard to believe anyone with brains would even consider not voting for them.
2/2 “During the campaign and, if they win, during a Biden-Harris administration, Ms. Harris’s staff hiring would be approved by Mr. Biden.”
“1/2 “potential for conflict between Biden &amp; Harris advisers was resolved ....at least for now: Mr. Biden and his advisers made plain to Ms. Harris that they expected to have the same understanding with respect to staff hiring that Mr. Biden had followed with” Obama.
“Biden advisers made clear that selecting Ms. Harris for the vice presidency did not mean selecting her full political entourage for jobs in the campaign or government. That rule would apply, Ms. Harris was told, even to her sister, Maya ...a former Hillary ... adviser”
“There was a particular distrust in the Biden camp for the sharp-elbowed California operatives with whom Ms. Harris has long surrounded herself, fearing that they might seek to undermine Mr. Biden in office to clear the way for Ms. Harris in 2024.”
The Biden camp is so distrustful of Harris they told her she couldn’t bring her staff or sister to the campaign.
Biden and Kamala are just the team for the job.

Joe Biden raised $26MIL in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket.

Nope.  We are going to get charges of sleaze 24/7 because of this horrible candidate with a Titanic full of baggage.  If Biden had been running against anybody other than Trump, Harris would ruin his chances.  She is a lousy candidate.
If Biden were running against anybody but Trump, his choice of Kamala Harris would be fatal to his chances.  She is that poor a choice.  We are going to get charges of cronyism 24/7, and nobody will have to make it up.  #KamalaHarris #JoeBiden
Congratulations,  We're so proud of you and happy you've been officially selected as Joe Biden's running mate!
So...Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Just when we thought 2020 couldn't get weirder.  My political commentary for the year is now complete...
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
"There are three people on this ticket, so it is a bit crowded."  What a terrible choice Biden made with Kamala Harris.  The Willie Brown thing is going to tear the ticket apart.
Biden picked Harris because he  A: is trying to convince us he’s not racist. B: wants the “top cop” to prevent any defunding on a federal level. If he wins then dies and she’s the president, I won’t complain as much because we desperately need feminine energy in the White House.

Biden’s best strategy:  play Rope-a-Dope with Trump.
Specially if Susan Rice is going to be Biden’s mate.
During the 2008 primary, Biden expressed surprise that Obama was 'clean,' being black and all. Sure Biden's a racist. There's a lot of racist sentiment in the U.S.. I've had black friends characterized by industry and other good qualities. But I have some prejudice in my psyche
What if Joe Biden just... never announces a VP?... Just frickin cowboys it, you know?  #DelawareStyle
Mayor Pete back in the news! He should be Secretary of State or UN Ambassador in the Biden Administration.  Nothing but respect for my guy.
Bill hicks still liked little girls and biden still sniffed little girls. Nothing you can say or do will change that. Yet you still cherish that 2 bit comedian so much that you claim his name sake. Sick!
BIGLY NEWS!  Chris Christie may play Biden in Trump's debate prep  first, he has to go on a diet, and then ride a bicycle like Joe did this weekend!
Interesting read.   The biggest #threat 2 the #GOP's #survival isn't #Biden, #VoterFraud, or even #tRUMP himself. It's the reality that the American #electorate is becoming more #racially &amp; #EthnicallyDiverse, more #urban, &amp; more likely not born in the #US.
Do we mention Biden likes to sniff little girls?
Joe Biden will now pick Papa Shango as his running mate.
The real reason is because Biden might think she died because the wrestler Kamala passed away today.
The Guardian, Really? Okay, You got me I'm totally gonna vote for Biden now even though he does like to smell children, is corrupt, involved in selling our country out to the communists like china, sounds like a racist and involved in U1. If only I had known this sooner.🤣
Now that Kamala has died.  Joe Biden to pick Papa Shango as his running mate. #RIPKamala
I did hear that Biden has Swastika tattoo. He had it done in ancient Sumeria when it symbolized the powers of nature.
...Or raping 13 year old girls. Not once has anyone accused Biden of kiddie rape, but court documents accuse Trump and Epstein.  You’re an amadán.
You mean they let Joe out of the basement for once. Did someone at least warn the alter boys and little girls. Who do you think sniffed  more children today, Trump or Biden? I know, Stupid question. We all know.
Saw your statement today that Biden will be impeached as soon as voted in. Going to be hard since you will no longer control the Senate. You are so out of touch you are totally ineffectual. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden boat parade!
Was looking for a Biden boat. Found it!
Biden is just like you, corrupt and secretly racist, but at least he has enough intelligence to go with the emerging liberal zeitgeist now. The American people are not going to tolerate more restriction and austerity; At long last it is time to ask what our country can do for us.
Swing Voters Still Prefer Trump Over Biden  via  Ring of Fire Network
I agree he is pulling out all the stops at a last ditch effort to try to gain some support that the pos has lost to  Biden
If Biden takes a cognitive test it will be rigged and he will pass with flying colors, there is no end to demorat corruption.
If he's elected, Biden will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to take America to the next level, to meet with achievement the bold promise of this new world. The time calls for an F.D.R., a moderate soul in the service of the people

Lol it’s crazy to be so educated yet so ill informed and ignorant. If you don’t know about Biden’s policies yet, you’ve just been letting the TV tell you what to think my dude. Good luck with that mindset.
You're the media too, Ben.  How do you feel about Trump tweeting that Biden isn't "worthy of the black vote"?  By your logic, if you don't call them out, you are equally as hypocritical.   *Sips out of conservative tears mug*
Biden has no code. He doesn't know his own history, much less the history of Black people in America. To him, we are all just minorities to be tolerated in a nation established by whites for the benefit of whites. He recognizes the demographic shift is influencing politics, tho.
Men have been at the helm of the ship of state since we've been a nation. Biden will pick a woman as Vice President. I hope he decides his age would preclude him from serving a second term. It's time for a woman to right this ship!
As with many people Biden wasn't my first choice for a presidential candidate. Or my second. Or my third. But I'd rather have him and a competent administration rather than this corrupt mob boss regime we have now. Biden has my vote. Trump and the GOP need to be run out of office

Why won't you press Harris or Biden? They won't answer any questions at so called press conferences.  Here's your opportunity to shine.🤡
Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro

Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I’m going to vote for Biden, of course, because I’m not a monster, but I’ll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn’t chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love’s The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn’t capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he’s choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won’t bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I’m not telling you who to vote for but you don’t think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn’t going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He’s scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn’t the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I’ll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
“She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,”  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump’s only concern is his ego, while Biden’s concern is what’s best for the country. He doesn’t hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween 🤔
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.

If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History — as well as the near future — will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I’m really not voting for Biden
A quick perusal of  ‘s timeline will show you a number of hit pieces on Biden and Harris.  He’s proud FedSoc member.  In other words, consider the source and ignore the content. Shame on

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That’s the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there’s a 20% chance he’ll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it’s 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden’s pick of Harris and it’s hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?

I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He’s seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn’t even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He’s a racist CisHet man who’s outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for “living in the past” about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He’d “lawfully and apolitically” bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he’ll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department 🙂
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she’s too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it’s sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn’t.  She may not apeal to the “Bernie Bro’s” but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. 🙄 Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45’s agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it’s one or the other (which it isn’t) personally I’d rather keep trump, at least we already know what he’s about. Biden hasn’t actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just “well I’m not trump” which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn’t sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all

Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It’s almost like we shouldn’t be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It’s almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....
I wonder who told Joe Biden he picked Kamala Harris for President? 🤔🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Biden's VP pick is 4 radical base.  called Joe racist while accept his VP pick. Harris introduces resolution condemning use of ‘Wuhan Virus’ term as racist, NOT use of Wuhan Virus bi-attack on non-Chinese population in the U.S. as racist.

Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro
Never get tired of that GIF. 😆
Will Kamala Harris help Joe Biden's bid for the White House?
Joe biden is a fucking moron. Im not even rock hard for singlepayer but he makes a TERRIBLE case for insurance tied to employment. He's a fucking idiot. Gonna be hard to vote for him
"REVENGE IS MINE" sayeth the Lord God:  Biden said we we should not talk of Jailing Donald Trump some day . . . for his many crimes.  God will send Liars to the Lake of Fire, for eternity, Jesus said. So why fret?

Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I’m going to vote for Biden, of course, because I’m not a monster, but I’ll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn’t chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love’s The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn’t capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he’s choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won’t bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I’m not telling you who to vote for but you don’t think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn’t going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He’s scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn’t the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I’ll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
“She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,”  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump’s only concern is his ego, while Biden’s concern is what’s best for the country. He doesn’t hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween 🤔
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.
#Biden and #Harris just demanded a nationwide mask mandate. Because apparently they think mandates and masks are popular  #Masks #NationwideMaskMandate

If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History — as well as the near future — will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I’m really not voting for Biden
A quick perusal of  ‘s timeline will show you a number of hit pieces on Biden and Harris.  He’s proud FedSoc member.  In other words, consider the source and ignore the content. Shame on
Don’t attack/guilt trip people who aren’t okay with Biden/Harris. Some ppl don’t want to vote for segregationists and cops 🙃
Ok. Sure but Last year, Kamala Harris stated that she believes the women who have accused Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and kissing. “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That’s the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there’s a 20% chance he’ll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it’s 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden’s pick of Harris and it’s hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He’s seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn’t even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He’s a racist CisHet man who’s outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for “living in the past” about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He’d “lawfully and apolitically” bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he’ll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department 🙂
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she’s too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it’s sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn’t.  She may not apeal to the “Bernie Bro’s” but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. 🙄 Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45’s agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it’s one or the other (which it isn’t) personally I’d rather keep trump, at least we already know what he’s about. Biden hasn’t actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just “well I’m not trump” which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn’t sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all
Does any reasonable person actually believe Joe Biden would finish his first term?

You can be a hater all you want but I’ve made my decision and that was after I fought for Biden from the time he was crowned the nominee.   He’s the center the neo cons wanted why couldn’t he have reached out to the progressives with his choice? #rockbottom
Does ANY Democrat actually think Joe Biden would finish his first term?
Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It’s almost like we shouldn’t be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It’s almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....
I wonder who told Joe Biden he picked Kamala Harris for President? 🤔🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden took a nice bike ride this weekend. They probably didn’t show that on OANN or Faux News....

Just chortling over here when GOP says a Biden-Harris administration would be extreme and inept. Couple things: #1 - (ahem) 👀 #2 - Then why would you be so worried about them winning?
It really doesn’t matter, what is she going to run on? Her record? Hahaha 🤣!!! Biden is dead in the water along with Harris.

Warren: "I'm Indian" (is white) Kamala: "I'm black" (is Indian) Biden: "You ain't black" (is Biden) Trump: "We need to fix our economy and get back to work."  Tough choice, man. Tough choice.

I voted for Hillary Clinton 3 times in my life. Biden? Shit. That’s the equivalent of running with slow people in the moral compromise space to me.
That would be interesting indeed. Jill Biden has her Doctorate in education, whereas, Melania has been to a doctor and has lied about her education.
1. Harris never called Biden a racist. 2. Criticizing her as a prosecutor AND a leftist is an interesting strategy.

Went 2 work n found out joe biden chose Kamala as his vp??? Sick of it
Biden's VP pick is 4 radical base.  called Joe racist while accept his VP pick. Harris introduces resolution condemning use of ‘Wuhan Virus’ term as racist, NOT use of Wuhan Virus bi-attack on non-Chinese population in the U.S. as racist.
Trumpets calling her left of Biden. Lefties calling her too far right.

I'm just hoping biden croaks... im a dark person roflmaoTrump lies about voting by mail because he doesn’t want us to vote or he doesn’t want our votes to be counted. He won’t correct his statements and he won’t shut up about his lies.    Let’s just vote until he’s buried in votes for Biden. Vote early. #TrumpIsAnIdiot
Get yourself ready to primary Biden in 2024, you can do it
She has more balls than Joe Biden!!!
Neither Obama nor Biden would need the attention you so desperately need every. single. day.

My dad is full force Biden/Harris 2020 and will work hard on this but the man has called Oreo's Oriels and Mimosas Mermosas for 72 years, I am not sure he can do it. Lol!! VP Harris it will be.
I support a green new deal. I was afraid Biden and Harris wouldn’t support it, but hearing they do, I’m definitely gonna vote for them now.
This 100%. The left is gonna take a dirt nap under Biden.

Fearing possible Biden victory, ICE enters decade-long private prison contracts
We just recently installed cable for my son, and I'm watching my first Trump "press briefing". Three minutes in, he's already attacking Biden. On the US taxpayer's dime.
Biden has been in office so many years he has cultivated friendships with many of the generals in our military. That's why I'm not too concerned if Trump tries a coup.
He already took America lower than its ever been. Biden/ Harris are the only way to get back. Pull your head out of your ass and look around you
Actually I'd say the destruction started in the 90s with Clinton but Joe Biden losing will seal its fate.
I am hearing you and what I’m hearing if that “criticism of Harris is not allowed.” She has flipped on several important issues, we should find I’m out if she has done so on climate change.   Biden does not support the Green New Deal. This is important.
Biden’s campaign has sent me two bumper stickers for free and I threw them both in the recycling bin.   I hope he doesn’t send a Biden/Harris one as that would just be even more waste of his campaign money (it would also go in the recycling bin)
Chris, when you try to silence criticism of Kamala Harris’s controversial record you are demoralizing voters who are apathetic about Biden/Harris.   Please be more conscious of the fact the voters Biden needs to sway are the ones who feel the most hesitancy about him and Harris
1. Even if he did win a 2nd term he can’t run for re-election cause of the 22nd amendment   2. Also yes. Since he’ll lose he will refuse to leave kinda just like Ronald and Nancy Reagan did but only now they’ll have to call the swat team on trump just like what Biden said
Only if the Socialist win, which isn’t likely with the un-Black Kamala in the race because we all know Biden will take a bye after 3 months.
EVERY CANDIDATE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE SOUND BITE NATURE OF DEBATES. Yang, Sanders, Booker, Warren, Biden, Harris, Gabbard, Swalwell, Bloomberg and, yes, Buttigieg.
Hell no!! The lack of humanity alone is far more than enough to ensure I vote for Biden. Hell, at this point I'd vote for my wacko neighbor 🤣🤣 doesn't have anything to do with education,  just saying

He’s playing both sides of the deck.  He has proclaimed his dislike for Biden and tRump. He has some alternative agenda that will never come to light, and is unwilling to compromise. My bet is he votes for tRump.
conservatives democrats always made the same promises biden does. 'business as usual' is not going to fix the over reach that just happenned. If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!
LIAR. Biden!!! Not a trusteorthy bone in your body!!!
Now is not the time in this universe to be picky about leaders. The choice is between Biden-Harris or Death.  Hmmm let me think about that...
If Trump is removing HUNDREDS of mail sorting machines and 1 in 4 votes are ALREADY mail in votes...  Who actually benefits more if democrats stay home and cant get their vote counted?  Who is actually trying to rig this election?  Biden or Trump?
Vice President Biden, there is a difference between absentee ballots and mass mail in ballots. Please review your civics and especially the US Constitution if you want my post graduate educated, white, female, non-victim, suburban vote.
bernie is even worse. damn the demoicrats for even talking to sanders and for runnind biden. Boith too conservative for me.
We can elect Joe Biden and Kamala but unless we get rid of the filibuster we will have political gridlock for at least the next 2 years.
I just heard Dan Bongino say the Harris Biden ticket wants us to wear masks all the time, inside and outside. I describe Joe Biden as Crucking fazy, I'm trying to be a lady.
We will never settle for Biden, we will not settle until this whole damn system has been dismantled, Biden and Trump seek to disarm the working class, which is an inherently bad thing as anyone who isn't armed is subject to the will of fascism, no matter who they are.
its always serious when its poor people, she said she wasnt to use the fbi to clean up our communities. What has she said shed do to stop the fbi from picking the president? What will biden do to stop that?

I would like to see them get on the debate stage. If you believe science, which neither Trump nor Biden do, we don’t have much time to reverse climate change. Biden refuses to endorse policies that turn that around in time. So facing catastrophic effects, we should just back...
Now do Obama and Biden.
Dude...I don't give one rat if Biden is aphasic...Trump has GOT to go...
People voted for Biden our of fear and out of perceived electability.  Hardly anyone believes he’s a great intellectual or a policy maker.
This thread is cracking me up!
Orwell would be aghast at both Trump and Biden/Harris.
Look for Barr to arrest Biden in October.
Full on Democrat here and I'm not excited about Biden, but he knows government and how to run the country.
Really? You think 80% of Americans make over 400,000 per year?
Yep as soon as trump our and Biden and Harris is in. Republicans are desperate crooks
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
you've tried to defund it for decades... Who do you think you're fooling?? C'MON MANNNNNNNNNNN
You actually think Biden will indict anyone ??? I am skeptical
theresnothing liberal about the way democrats treated hillary or the way they treat liberals. people like biden gave you trump. And go buy yourself a party that doesnt hate panty suits with your dsa money
Anyway point being is there is too much risk and what if Oregon does have a shot of turning red because of massive voter suppression? Fuck the DNC and Biden for picking a cop VP but bite the bullet and vote for the bastard anyway because that’s pickle we in.
biden voted for segregation and harris ran this time on cleaning up communities. I will not state that i believe them or not
As a leftist who wants Biden to win, I have some advice for y’all in the establishment:  “Come the fuck on” is not going to convince leftists to vote for centrists. Try something else.
Didn’t attract anyone who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden
I am a touchy feely person like Biden. I hug everyone! These are his family!    At least he doesn’t molest women in clubs, dressing rooms, at pageants and have affairs while wife #3 is pregnant,oh &amp; brag about being able to grab women in their privates (used vulgar terminology).
And Biden/ the DNC haven't? One wrong doesn't negate another.   If I murder 1 or 5 people, I'm still a murderer. I don't understand how you #BlueMAGA people can support any of it. So gross.
FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.
Take Biden and an honest administration.
Nope. No fracture big enough to fit an orange dictator-wannabe through it. Not even close. Stop trying to make it seem like we aren’t all voting Biden/Harris no matter what. 48 million in 48 hours. There’s no contest in a free and fair election.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for police terrorism.
democrats hung hillary out to dry for 30 years... they presumed her guilty with no evidence. If trump wins again he will grind their pathetic elitis party to dust. if biden wins he wil;;l try to repeal some tax cuts :)
I’ve seen so many bad takes on how electing Biden is gonna be some big victory for queer rights and all I can think about is this
if "Work with Biden" means impeach him, make Harris president and completely undermine centrism by making congress a squad of 535... maybe they're half-right.
Are the cognitively impaired? Well, they are biden bros, that should tell you everything that you need to know.
Joe Biden is definitely actually racist... Just look at his voting record...
IS THE WORST EVIL!  Ask about the troops Putin had killed, &amp; Trump did NADA! Ask about the 1000's of KURD allies he left to die in battle by rmvng our troops! You can't prove what you said! If you don't like Biden/Harris simply don't vote for them but don't spew lies!
Biden wasn't introduced to Jill until 3 years after the tragedy.  I would take a good hard look at your informational sources.... they are misleading you bigly
I honestly can't think of one thing that Biden has said that shows he's trying to block religious freedom.
Any vote other than Biden-Harris is support for Trump. Do you want 4 more years of this?
Thanks. Give me some more reasons why I should cancel my plans to vote Green and vote, instead, for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The deal Biden says is the work of past administrations:)
Kamala you rule! Biden made the best choice. I believe it's a winning ticket. Knock it out of the park! The GOP are tresonist and need to be held accountable for their actions. They all should be jailed for treasonous crimes against our great country. Beat down little boy donny.
Harris will likely be the 2024 nominee, assuming Biden wins and she handles the VP slot with a modicum of success.   #YangGang it is our job to make SURE Yang is on that ticket.
Funny you think Biden wants to bring our mfg jobs back to America when it was him and Obama outsourced those jobs to begin with.
JFK, FDR, Reagan, Obama, and now Pence. Wow what a speech giver. And the roar of the crowd. Watch out Biden this guy means business
They each had enough confidence to tell Biden’s VP vetting team directly that they thought it was Harris’s campaign. Amazing.
“One longtime Biden supporter told her bluntly that she should make clear she would not upstage Mr. Biden in the campaign, telling her, ‘You don’t need to be Sarah Palin to his John McCain.’”   Ok now I feel sorta bad for Harris 😭
“One longtime Biden supporter told her bluntly that she should make clear she would not upstage Mr. Biden in the campaign, telling her, ‘You don’t need to be Sarah Palin to his John McCain.’l
Let me get this straight in my head. Who has always had a pet dog? Trump or Biden?
“Biden advisers asked about contributions she received as state attorney general from Steven Mnuchin, who at the time was running a bank, OneWest, that was accused of violating foreclosure laws. Ms. Harris declined to pursue prosecutions in the case.”
Seems like a weak argument to me. I mean the Biden team's explanation of the process.

That’s it. I’ve been civil with you but you’re just crotchety boomer who is upset with the fact young voters do not like Joe Biden. He has a lengthy history of supporting corporate interests. Polling shows people are *not* enthusiastic to vote for him. He sucks ass. Period.
Biden/Harris merch on the way!
Oh yeah, like it's going to be so hard to beat Biden and Harris. The second he announced Harris, so so many of his supporters suddenly left and will not be voting for him at all. The debates will be hilarious. Trump wall mop the floor with Biden.
This is such a crazy cartoon I dont know where to start. This would be like if JFK was in heaven and he told Joe Biden "I love your convertible :)"
Biden doesn't get to call for anything he's not the president.
No, that's Biden too, lol!
democrats treated liberals like shit for 30 years, Now i'll vote for biden if yoiu give me two minutes with thenazi in alocked room
Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.
So Biden/Harris will mandate that everyone wear a mask for the next 3 months if elected? Guess they think if elected they will be king/queen, well they can kiss a$$, I'm not a child that needs a parent to decide what is in my best interest. Food will be next watch and see.
“You’re not allowed to criticize Biden and you’re not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!”  Considering the fact this is the time period when he’s *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.
We can vote for Biden and hold him accountable at the same time. It’s not like our brains ran out of energy to do multiple things   Blindly swearing allegiance while not holding him accountable is a terrible idea.
The vitriol and shocking statements coming from Trump are an indication of his insanity. He wants to prosecute Obama and Biden for treason???? What!!! Where are the men with white coats and straight jackets? Yet the criminal Republican Senators keep quiet.
Fuck Donald Trump and Fuck Joe Biden
If you’re not voting blue bc Biden chose Harris as his VP, I just wanna say that you the problem. So called “activists” who hate Trump are willing to jeopardize 4 more years of that clown all for what? LMAO y’all foolish.
Is the DNC trying to discourage people from voting for Biden?
If I wished that both Biden and Trump had to drop out of running for POTUS due to illness does that make me a bad person?
The Biden Harris Ticket
Supporting Biden/Harris doesn't require *blindly* supporting them.  You should be willing to hold them accountable-- remember Biden has a long history of being a pro-Bank anti-consumer Democrat.  This is just a fact.  You need to be willing to keep him in line.
Well we know we can depend upon Joe Biden to rein in big Pharma.

It's perfectly fine to shit all over Biden and Harris, and still vote for them.
I don’t think it’s very accurate to say the party is moderate when Democrats voted based on their fears. Multiple polls showed policies pushed by Bernie and Warren were more popular than Biden. Polling specifically showed Democratic voters to trust Bernie more on healthcare
Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.
This is ignorant of all the progress we've made these last years. The left is alive and strong. We will effectively pressure Biden and the democrats to clean up this mess. Our words are currently falling on deaf ears. It will not be like that after January.
placing my bet now that biden picks janet napolitano for secretary of education because of the way she successfully handled (fired, arrested, mowed down) striking graduate workers asking for #cola (cost of living adjustments)
Weird of Joe Biden to just drop by like that. He usually calls first.
By that superb logic. If you know I am POS, doesnt that make you a POS too? Takes one to know one? Right.  And for the record, I never once said I was  a Biden fan.   Thanks for playing.
“This nomination almost guarantees that valid criticism and utter hatred of Black women will be on full display, and we will have to quickly learn the difference and respond accordingly.”
Our only route to victory is hoping Biden gets more aggressive. We know that Trump is actively anti-environment and literally wants to accelerate the problem.
I think people are going to be genuinely surprised when this continues under a president Biden
So far, Biden and the DNC have shown a lot of contempt for progressives. We’ll vote for Biden, but only because it’s getting Trump out of office.
Biden/Harris, typical imperialist, corrupt, corporate-owned, and opportunist ticket from the #Democrats.  Do not vote for it and hope for a change.
.... now Joe Biden, he definitely is racist and has racist policies. Always has. That is easily proven. But I would like you to prove that Trump is. I bet you can't. You are pathetic.
The most effective way to ensure  continued and significant influence in a Biden administration is to elect a Democratic Senate majority.

Better watch out, Kamalas body language indicates she is expecting to be President. Looks like the left is ready to declare Biden unfit for the duties as POTUS, allowing her to step in, looks like she knew that when she stepped out of the race. Michelle available?
Well said. I get that they want a prominent republican to show public support for Biden, but Kasich is a terrible choice.

NPR talking about how financial managers are happy Biden chose Kamala Harris, I’m feeling nauseous
There was a lot of pressure from donors to pick Kamala Harris. Remember: Karen Bass is just as progressive as Warren and Biden still didn’t choose her.
that might be the secret of his success. sanders comey trump, democrats treat anyone who treats them like crap like gold. harris/biden proves they are not liberal now.

Great reporting. You really nailed Biden here.
biden would bring back segregation, and harris would use the fbi to clean up the cities the way trump did. democrats screwed hillary because they are god damned nazis who deserve trump.
she is better choice then joe biden and hillary clinton, she dose not have  same backlash as both them.
Overwhelmed with the POSSIBILITIES that lie ahead of America with the leadership of Biden/Harris.......They are an amazing team.....

He’s explaining why we won’t vote for Biden.
I’m all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden’s 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You’ve implied multiple times that young people’s opinions don’t matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it’s healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren’t thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
