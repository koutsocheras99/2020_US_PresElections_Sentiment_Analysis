Replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and changing your shirt.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Well, shit. That got Biden my vote. If he's able to hurt God, he's my sort of President. Plus, why would I want to bring down his wrath upon me? I've got a family to worry about.

AP source: Biden will not go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept his party's White House nomination because of concerns over the coronavirus.
former Vice President Biden, please, please let us know along the way what your steps would be. Any help or suggestions would definitely be listened to. This is how you win the election. We are all looking for the right answers. Please help us learn and  practice. Convert me.
At least the Kansas GOP voters understand self-interest. Kobach cost them the governor's office and if Biden's numbers hold, it would have been easy to see a scenario where a Democrat beat him in November.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
Man I hope people keep putting this fake narrative out there about Biden. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so senile he can‚Äôt tie his shoes.‚Äù Then he shows up to the debates and you‚Äôve created a better than expected performance
made a fool out of him by just stating facts. Also, Joe Biden is NOT the president of the United states. Your grifter step father is.

The Biden campaign should borrow the voice track of this one.
With 92 days until Election Day, here's what we're watching heading into a new week in the 2020 campaign:
The character of this nation has already been altered in the last 5 months.  The left is free to do as it pleases, while the right is being ordered to live under strict guidelines.  This is totally unacceptable to free thinking individuals.  Even under a Biden presidency.

Obama and Biden didn't do a thing during H1N1 for over 6 months. Of those 160,000, over 53000 are from nursing homes in states with Dem govs who forced covid+ patients into NHs. Biden has no empathy. Hes behind the '94 crime bill that disproportionately imprisoned black community
here's an idea, QUIT TELLING LIES! do your DAMN JOB and actually BE a good leader! until you get your act together, i'm NOT voting for you this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Joe Biden will NOT be hurting God..YOU are hurting God by being a stupid ass bitch baby!!!!
Trump is going to work hard to leaving the biggest mess he can for Biden to clean up to hurt his image and success
Wait... is Joe Biden a Republican?
even if biden wins he‚Äôs going to lose
Biden is flaming garbage, I agree.
Nice, what if Biden's handlers choose a white straight male?
Hahaha both of these guys are just ridiculous. I firmly believe the democratic party put Biden through because they want Trump to win. The liberal media is making so much damn money shitting on him every day. Whether he actually says something ridiculous or not
No wonder Biden's people keep him mostly in hiding. The Democrats could not have picked a worst candidate
Joe Biden is a racist.  Pass it on.
President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.
Biden‚Äôs actions show him to be filled with empathy, Trump, the opposite. Likely only one of the two has read the Bible. Only one uses the Bible as a prop.
And he talks about Biden not speak8ng well.

He‚Äôs got more cognitive ability than Biden
To be clear - my vote is not for Biden.  It‚Äôs against Trump, Pence, Kushner, Miller, Barr, DeVos, the entire gang of crooked fixers, thugs, and incompetents known as the GOP, and the continued assault against equality, justice, civil rights, compassion, and basic human dignity.
Joe Biden could make fart noises instead of talk and I would still never vote for you.
if Biden picks ice cream or potato chips im still voting for him. our lives are at stake we need to get rid of the monster occupying the oval office

Can you imagine if a Republican candidate asked a black TV host if he was a junkie or on cocaine? It would in their career. It should end Joe Biden‚Äôs career. This is unacceptable.

You have 8 followers.  Trump doesn't have dementia.  I have family that has it and Biden screams of it.  Get real.  Go bot someone else.
I don‚Äôt think it matters. People aren‚Äôt voting for Biden so much as they are voting against Trump. His VP is who is getting my vote.
Biden is the same age as Trump. And he was in the White House for 8 years. A comeback against you is a senior abuse so I may to apologise
Anyone else feeling robbed that there hasn‚Äôt been a presidential debate yet.  Or that Joe Biden hasn‚Äôt found out who his running mate is yet? The election is 3 months away and these two haven‚Äôt been gone toe-2-toe discussing policy.
Lol.  So what is a vote for Trump?  Going back to square wheels, re-writing the constitution, and pretending that debt doesn‚Äôt matter (till a D is in the WH)?  A vote for Biden is the best available option.
Pretty sure Biden knows how to pronounce Yosemite and has heard of it. Not sure if Trump has even BEEN to a national park besides Mt. Rushmore for 3rd of July and Trump National Golf Club
I hope you are picked as Biden's VP candidate.
I did no such thing.  You're good at spin like the rest of the liberal fakenews.  I was giving one example.  I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 but you better damn well know I am in November.  40+ years in politics, Biden is a moron.  Not to mention having dementia.  #FFS

Biden is despicable, and I volunteered for Bernie too but I‚Äôll still vote for Biden. Trump is literally killing people. Can‚Äôt keep him in power
Excuses. They don't want Biden in front of a live microphone.
I hope to God, you don't really believe that any Biden supporter is brainwashed by Media, and CCP. If so, maybe you need your meds checked?
Opinion piece in the New York Times calls for "scrapping" the 60-year tradition of televised presidential debates:
Are Biden supporters this afraid of putting him out in a public forum without pre-writte  questions and answers? If so, how could he be president. If you can't trust him to say what he means to the American public, you definitely can't trust him with any foreign adversaries.
That isn't news.  Everyone knows Biden is a place holder
Biden is broken, he can't even remember where he is most of the time. Trump was doing great until this year. The revenge plot of the Democrats continues, even with this Pandemic, the cities with the highest death count? Democrats run them lol. Dem boys and girls ruined everything
You think brain damaged Biden will do better? Defund the police, let the rioters do whatever they want? Go to war against Germany because he thinks Hitler's rise to power is happening due to his broken mind? Biden is a joke. Anyone with a functioning brain knows this.
Vote for Trump, Biden is Hiding lol. He's only "Ahead in the polls" because they keep him hidden. Any anti trump madness on Twitter is just Communist Propaganda and #FakeNews Don't buy it.
And Joe Biden did not write it anyways.
The Democrat Party (including Beijing Biden) is now dominated by its Marxist wing.  IF your party wins this next election the US Republic will be dead.  The Democrat Party should never again have access to the national reins of power.
That's funny, last time I checked he cut taxes for middle class. Yet Biden wants to raise taxes for everyone?
I hear you. How did it ever happen anyway.... Trump getting elected. Such a strange sequence of events. Would Hillary have been or will Biden be better? Not trying to start a Twitter battle for sure. You got me by 2 years in your searchüòâ
If Beijing Biden wins thhebRepublic is lost.  I cannot allow this to happen to my children and grand children.
If Biden wins Alyssa M would probably be a foreign diplomat, she‚Äôs so knowledgeable on everything you know!
If Biden can't handle  in a debate, then how would he ever be able to have any meaningful back and forth with enemies Iran, China, or North Korea. Their leaders will take Biden for all the US has. Just admit you know Biden will look old and frail. Which he is.
...I'd like to see data from a focus group for their reactions to Biden saying " I don't debate lunatics &amp; liars"
Biden is the Trojan horse for the radical left and THEY are managing him tightly to prevent any more incoherent ramblings..
I agree she's more progressive and would take her in a heartbeat. I do wonder about the perception if she's chosen, given what's happening with BLM right now.  If she's chosen I'd love to Biden announce some cabinet positions with the other VP possibilities.
Read Joe Biden‚Äôs Lips: New Taxes; candidate would pursue more than $3 trillion in new levies on incomes, payrolls, and more
Joe Biden don't care about what you want. Joe Biden can't remember what he cares about either. Maybe its time to vote Trump. Give the Democrats 4 more years to regroup, cut out the commie cancer and get back to American values.
Even if some who voted Bernie didn't show up for Hillary, as much as I'm sure it stings, it's the job of the nominee to energize the base. Otherwise, they won't turn up to vote.  If Biden loses, I hope to God not, and I don't expect it, but I'd imagine it'd be for the same reason
I voted for Bernie and Hillary respectively in 2016, which will parallel this year with Bernie and Biden. Don't assume and blame others. Most are probably not like how you imagine. Sometimes, the one you support doesn't win out.
One of the reported finalists for Biden VP selection.
There‚Äôs no way any of this would happen but I truly geeked out on how this all would work.       ‚Äî‚ÄîPostpone the Election? That Could Mean President Biden
Already know of Beijing Biden.
A WARNING to  &amp;  Americans are anticipating your attack on Biden. Do you really think they're going to believe anything you present?
If you let those who were planning on voting for you go without housing, food, and money they need for transportation to get to and from work you are pretty much handing the presidency to Joe Biden because they just won't vote for you.
Let's stand with anyone who will defund the military and REFUSE to stand with anyone who votes to increase its budget - like your friend Joe Biden
Will Biden fix all of that? Alright, then let us try to see if he'll listen.
Besides, since when has our motto been to dream less? Last time I checked, Biden has not won yet. As such, his cabinet is still wide open. Advisers are as much responsible for setting policy as POTUS. I think it's only fair to bend his ear a little since we are voting for him.
Yes! Biden 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
If Biden somehow becomes our next president just remember, if you were one of those individuals stating "Trump's not my president", you can't get mad and argue if people start stating "Biden's not my president "
He isn't a problem. Your family funneling our money into your family coffers &amp; to Trump sponsors is an actual crime.  Hunter Biden got a position because of privilege of familial association. This is a glass house you don't want to be throwing rocks in, moron.  #TrumpCrimeFamily
That's because he knows he's not going be there anymore, so he wants construction noise, saws and hammering to be the soundtrack for Biden 5 months from now. Maybe he can even create a secret passage? He's such a #uck.
just like your fake ad on joe biden?
Or Biden say 150 million in the U.S. have died from COVID
This sort of nonsense could push me toward voting for Biden. I want to see where this goes first.
In my very unscientific poll, 62.5% of the respondents said they believe there will be no public debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. I have heard the same prediction from folks on the right and left. Time will tell. #Election2020
First he tried to dig up dirt on Biden and they found nothing. Then he tried to say Biden wasn‚Äôt all there and that didn‚Äôt stick. Now this new low. Trump is scared to face off against
Will Beijing Biden and the Marxists now in control of the Democrat party bring this tyranny to the US?  They can be seen posting about going after Trump supporters if they win the election.
It is much more likely Beijing Biden and the Marxists now in control of the Democrat party will bring this tyranny to the US.  They can be seen posting about going after Trump supporters if they win the election.
Yeah, but somehow I still don't see you voting for Biden.  Maybe you won't vote for anybody but definitely not Biden.
Not trump is a bigger prize. I'll deal with the Not Biden in the next election.
What jobs did he provide for the black community? Biden signed a bill to put black peoples in jails Trump signed one to get them out. Want to keep going?
Portland, Seattle, New York, Chicago pretty much all of California all shit. Shall I keep going or shal I continue to show you how fucked up the streets are and have been? I‚Äôll wait to tell me one thing Obama or Biden for black people. Go ahead.
If anything Kamala is Hillary in blackface.  She's a repellent politician, who wears pant suits and cackles loudly.  Biden might as well be a cardboard cutout.  He's uninspiring and projects no enthusiasm.
Wow Politico..what masterful work discovering that Joe Biden is a real human being who overcame his stutter. I'll bet he was a very hard working little boy. And that is a cheap nugget of info.
Bullock is going to win. Biden is going to win also.
There is literally nothing more important in the world than a Biden win. Having said that, this birther thing is utter bullshit that we are falling for. This same question was raised about McCain. The right knows it‚Äôll drive us crazy and we‚Äôre letting them.
The National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents 300,000 current and retired workers, said Thursday that Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office.
Why is this breaking news?  They endorsed Biden six weeks ago.  Long before this whole narrative was born.
If you like the arrangement, use it. If you don't, don't.  That's true whether you're their customer or vendor.

People aren't excited for Biden at all, and adding Harris on top of that? ARE YOU TRYING TO LOSE? Those two have contributed to a police state and systemic racism more than Trump has, that I know is true. Your candidate is SO BAD that he probably can't even beat Mango Mussolini.
The only way to save our country is to get Dem majorities in the house and senate. They are going to need to impeach him and remove him from office after he steals the election. Joe Biden will probably never see the inside if the Whitehouse as president.
BS....you can peddle that crap to your üêë.....but the rest of American knows its untrue.... sank our economy...Biden in all his years in office has done one damn thing...your ancestors owned slaves and Biden praises Byrd who was the grand poopa of the KKK...so KMA
There's absolutely no way Joe Biden actually came up with the idea of national mask mandates.  That had to come from his handlers.  Joe Biden is basically on autopilot at this point.  He'll say anything that's written down on paper or typed up on the teleprompter.
Biden can‚Äôt put 2 words together.
If Joe Biden said he was going to institute a national mandate to wear ball gags, the brainless flyblow who look forward to voting for Biden, including the media, would clap excitedly.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

Jailing people of color for victimless crimes(Harris), and writing the 1994 crime bill which majorly contributes to systemic racism (Biden), are you guys trying to lose to Mango Mussolini?
They're too scared to let #JoJorgensen2020 in on the poll, and if they let her debate Trump and Biden, she would embarrass both of those old racist pedophiles. Enjoy voting for your turd sandwich.
You're not getting M4A out of Biden. When will you guys learn to stay away from the duopoly candidates? How many times do you need to get slapped in the face?
You might want to look into Biden's 1994 crime bill. You know, the one that Trump is abusing today. They're the same person. And Harris the cop/prosecutor who would send innocent people to prison and never admit wrong doing? Terrible choice. Shot yourselves in the foot again.
I know it was a good day for the Trump campaign.  Why?  This was trending top when Biden and Harris spoke.
25th Amendment is invoked within 18 months. If Dems control the senate Obama replaces RBG within 3 months. Courtpacking of 3 additional left wing judges to the bench for a total of 12. A Biden second term may bring it to 15 judges total on the bench.
In all honesty, of all the people Biden could pick from, Gabbard would have been the better pick.  At least she's not polling 2% nationally like #HeelsUpHarris üë†

Truthfully Biden abandoned his "moderate" stance and chose one of the most divisive running mates to date.
Your retort is a 'she's not as evil as.' Between Biden's Crime Bill and Harris' zealousness in policing, they've left babies without parents for victimless crimes, and with their warhawkishness (especially Biden), abroad left many kids without parents and parents without kids.
I agree with you 100%! I'm very, very concerned about this election. I love my freedom, if Biden wins, our country will become socialist.
Recently moved from CA because it's a soup sandwich. If biden/harris win, the country become california. And yes, I believe those proper nouns don't deserve to be capitalized.

And we can believe #Biden as he has already done this with Obama.
how does context change the meaning? you‚Äôre arguing that we should just accept that m4a will not be part of the platform because biden‚Äôs not going to remove all  healthcare protections?
Lol, no debate needed. Trump is destroying his campaign all by himself. Why would Biden want to get in the way of that?
Biden is just a chair warmer or place marker.
One thing for sure, it will be a woman of color, since Biden has painted himself in to that corner.
It was the Obama/Biden 8yrs that gave us President Donald Trump
Lol you're high. Biden is a walking sacrilege
Legionnaires' disease is not being misdiagnosed as COVID-19, and a missile wasn't responsible for the massive explosion in Beirut. Here are the facts.
Republicans push Kanye 2020. But will it really hurt Biden?
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election
Neither one are perfect, but people like Biden go around saying they're devout Catholics on the one hand, and support murdering the unborn on the other.
I know Joe Biden is talking about everything he‚Äôll do when he is elected to the office of the president , but will he help the people of Flint get clean water? ü§î
When you're left to defending the pro-choice stance of Biden.
Not just you.  I think Biden has become unable to control his filters and blurts out whatever it is that comes to mind.
Get caught up with the morning's top headlines, the national weather forecast, today's celebrity birthdays and more.
The current Republican party put party over country. Your father put country over party. He would vote for Joe Biden.
you are not there. You fall under Joseph Goebbels philosophy.  Accusebothers of which you are guilty. You are not cognitively aware of anything. Yo-semite? Thighland? Biden, a practicing catholic is godless,  while you refuse to quote a scripture? Please. Smdfh.
Replacing Trump with Biden is like shitting your pants and changing your shirt.
Playing electoral defense, Trump claims Biden opposes God
Well, shit. That got Biden my vote. If he's able to hurt God, he's my sort of President. Plus, why would I want to bring down his wrath upon me? I've got a family to worry about.
Joe Biden knows what you are thinking.And about Joe Biden???
Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Biden cannot even name a Biden policy
What's crazy is that truckers are so predominantly MAGA due to Obama / Biden / Clintons abandoning labor. Remember the Teamsters Union? My immediate family was hard core Democrat Teamsters. Most abandoned the party during Bill Clinton's war on the working class.
Sweet. So is Joe Biden with this misleading tweet. Looks like we both support lying candidates üòï
Really gotta add per my wrath on that shitposter's comments: Their general argument is that 1) Marxism = Tankie Authoritarianism, 2) Biden-Harris is Tankie, 3) Biden-Harris are Marxists, 4) If you disagree you haven't studied Marxism. Swiss cheese has less holes than this arg.
Historically more republicans have voted by mail than Democrats, &amp; that includes the majority of a Trumps current &amp; former cabinet members. Him trying to block people from voting by mail is an bizarre strategy since it likely hurts him more than Biden, also he‚Äôs a fucking moron.
You don't have to be pro-Trump (although I certainly am), in order to have contempt for the Biden/Harris ticket.
Biden should have this privilege also.
Prayers to this woman and I hope for her recovery.  But it shows a difference between South Dakota and Democrat America.  Joe Biden's America, thugs. attack women, not Bison.  #BisonLivesMatter
This is how I feel about Joe Biden.  Whenever I see he's tending i wonder if this is the time he forgot the layout of his home, trips and fell down the stairs.  (I Don't actually think this)   I responded this way to show you how disgusting wishing someone dead over politics is.
Dr Fauci doesn‚Äôt do this.  What does Biden know the Dr doesn‚Äôt?   Lol
Question for the Harris/Biden campaign:  Will Treasury Secretary Mnuchin be asked to stay on, given Kamala's very special relationship with the should-have-been white collar convict?
sha256-key-decipher just finished and I think I've cracked the Biden campaign slogan. Channeling Ralphie from Christmas Story now. Here goes...   "BUILD... BACK... BOMBER!"  That's the unencrypted, validated Biden campaign motto folks! You heard it here first.
Build Back Bitter?  Sorry. Still trying to decrypt this insanely strange Biden/Harris campaign motto.

When a nation is on the verge of total revolution, its lower and middle class thrown into the fires of precarity, one doesn't shove forward two overpaid hacks for Capital as the answer. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have always been order takers for the Overclass. #GeneralStrike
"I love my earthly brother Joe Biden for his principled stance on austerity. When Bernie Bros demanded Medicare for All, Free College and no more colonial wars, Joe channeled his inner Adolph and shouted Nine! Nine! Nine!"
I hear ya. I think as a former VP, Biden has lifetime Secret Service protection. And now, as the presumptive Dem nominee, it's likely that the detail has been increased.
Biden - ‚Äúwe need to win the minority and womens vote!‚Äù  *picks the absolute worst Minority and Woman to have as VP.   Starting to wonder if Joe is starting to lose his hearing and eyesite aswell.
I wear a mask. I have no idea how they think they‚Äôd enforce this.  I heard that Biden wants to require it outside too. That‚Äôs just stupid.  I‚Äôm actually more sick of hearing about masks than I am of COVID.
BROKEN NEWS: Joe Biden issues statement that after he's elected president and all Americans are forced to wear a mask, that the mask will be required "not to cover up the hair, scalp or any portion thereof of any female person wearing such masks."
I wonder how much Clintons and Biden paid him to write this! He is the actual ConMan!
Watch this video. Joe biden is a straight up creep.
Well Joe Biden does not want you in his god damn party, that's for sure. :)
If Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or any of their staff appear in public without a mask outdoors at any point in the next three months, will they be hypocrites and according to Biden's own standard "unpatriotic?"
Do you agree with Joe Biden that all Americans should be required to wear mask outdoors for at least the next three months?
Surprisingly Joe Biden disagrees with Hillary and DWS on the FBI report that Russia hacked the DNC. So much for #Russiagate!
Surely you must not know Joe Biden. "Come on, man!" But your Disney-esque world fed to you by the marketers and public relations profs must be comfortable and fun. Sorry to bother you with reality. Carry on!
Joe Biden has spent forty years in Congress and as VP as nothing but a walking, talking anger management lawsuit. There isn't an ounce of decency in that nasty grifters being. You're being played like Trump cons his MAGA fools.
He‚Äôll give Biden a piece of chcolate while the crowds orgasms in sync
Ummmm Biden is a hard worker?
Ok I officially can not pick up satire at all anymore... I don't get how people can say biden is a good leader... he's literally a puppet..

+7 in WI +6 in PA, +7.5 in MI, +5 in FL. It‚Äôs only August, so it‚Äôs certainly still possible things change (hence Silver‚Äôs 29% chance for Trump). But that‚Äôs such a wide margin to overcome and Biden only has to win like two of those states.
Injecting bleach is #Fakenews, you know it. Hydro has tons of doctors being suppressed that it works. The only one who should be scared of Harris, is Joe Biden. That boy doesn't have four years in him and we all know it. She slept her way to the top. All she has to do now is wait
Joe Biden should not win.
Treat Biden like they treated Reagan!!!!!
I've pinned this to refer back to it. If Joe Biden is progressive, THIS IS THE EASIEST PLEDGE EVER. If he's a fascist, he will say no.  Simple binary test.  Blue MAGA: Don't yell at me to vote Joe. Read this and get Joe to pledge. If he doesn't, then he's a fascist. Easy peasy!
Blue MAGA says I have to name my price for voting Biden. Begrudgingly, here it is: No colonial wars for Empire.  Swear off ALL coups, genocides, invasions, military aid for terrorists. Leave Venezuela and Nicaragua alone. End Yemen genocide. Syria drones.   Do that and I'll vote.
Except Joe Biden is the one guy who always finished second in a one-person race.
The administrators of biden‚Äôs account should fight back.
Hmmmmmmm here you go Rebubs  And you're saying Biden likes little girls? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ nice try!
I'm a huge fan of snark and dark humor. Got my ass ratioed for it last Jan and loved every minute of my public flogging. Posted a dream ticket with President Kamala, Klobuchar AG, Warren Treasury. Etc.   Funny how in six months after a Biden win, I may have been totally right.
If Biden knew how to fix things at all and executed on them he would‚Äôve under Obama, didn‚Äôt seem like he did then so why now
It's not a popular argument. But unlike Blue MAGA and Khive, I deal with lots of non-ideological independents who are undecided. Dems shit the bed bad with Biden. Truly second worst to Bloomberg. Maybe worst on foreign policy.
Nicaragua coup is go the moment Biden is in. It's why Contra war criminal daughter Navarro is tweeting happy thoughts tonight. Contra fascists, Venezuela right wingers, all readying for that green light.
This gives me more pause on Biden in this thought experiment. Biden is the MIC boy. He's always done whatever they ask for. Trump is in constant battles and by no means their puppet. He's a grifter and a con running his own racket. That a valid read?
Hard call. Biden's donors want him to saber rattle China and extract concessions. Depends on if China is still in continuing game or end game on ascendency. Nobody's bothering Russia. They have nothing the Overclass wants to take. Venezuela tho...
Biden team should be making content like this ALL DAMN DAY.  All the platforms. All day long.
And if we want independent votes, we'd better do DAMN BETTER than this. I'll give you Biden video in Senate at war criminal Abrams that we need to be more murderous in supporting the fascist Contras. You want that proof? Or his support for fascist coups? I got 'em. "Aspiring?"
Think of it this way: You just approached an independent voter. They asked you why to vote for Biden. "Because Trump is a Nazi!!!" Okay, they say. You show me hard evidence of this and I'll reconcile it with Biden's 40+ years of propping up fascists and Nazis. I might vote Biden.
Build Backwards Better is literally the Biden campaign theme. Backwards progress apparently?
During the 1970s through 2016, Nicaraguans, Guatamalans, Chileans, etc. were slaughtered in the hundreds of thousands by colonial neoliberalism. Joe Biden a chief proponent. Under incompetent Trump that has mostly stalled. Is this your "incremental progress"?
NOTICE: This is a devil's advocate thought experiment; I want to push this question objectively. Millions of independents will not respond to "Orange Man Bad" "Trump Nazi" "Trump rapist" and other hyperbole when verifiable facts implicate Biden as much or more. Need better args.
It's critically important we use precision and accuracy in our arguments. If we gaslight "Trump's a Nazi" we only turn even more away who know that's just hyperbole. Worse is when Trump illuminates all the actual fascists Joe Biden has put into power via CIA coups and wars.
This is extensively a devil's argument. Don't misunderstand me. But I want you to objectively substantiate your argument: What solid proof do you have that Donald Trump is a member of the Nazi party? I can prove Biden has backed and empowered ACTUAL Nazis via coups.
Which Nazi? The corporate con man in Orange, or the ghoul who actually used U.S. military, IC and foreign policy to overthrow democracies in Latin America and put in ACTUAL Nazis? Contras. Pinochet. Guatamalan military coup. That's 100% Biden. Biden's the Nazi. Trump's a con.
Trump made Rex SoS and Rex bombed out. What did Rex do to make anything different than Obama/Biden/Hillary? Nothing. These are scary stories for children that corporate neolibs tell us. Joe's backed by the same people. Kamala got rich off of them. Let's not gaslight each other.
Trump boat rally maybe you don‚Äôt know what they are because Biden has never had one.
Seems I need to have a convo with #khive.  If I vote Trump, I keep my guns. No new colonial wars. Nation crashes. Democrats listen to leftists.  If I vote Biden, Kamala takes my guns. New wars. Empire remains strong. Democrats keep us silenced.  Why wouldn't I vote Trump?
I can't wait until Biden/Harris pledge access to a timeshare as a solution for the housing/eviction crisis.
Joe Biden was far right of Reagan and war criminal Elliott Abrams on colonialism, coups, death squads and backing fascists. Loved the Contras. Supported Pinochets efforts. Disasterous Biden Plan for Latin America wrecked Honduras giving Trump winning border wall crisis.
How many successful CEOs ever landed their job by telling the company's board "Damn that last guy you had here sucked. Let me list 100 ways he sucked."  That's Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's entire campaign strategy.
You need to find a mirror and a history book and have a very honest conversation before you accuse. Joe Biden backed Contras and Pinochet. Actual Nazis and fascists. Joe is a colonialist and fascist. He just fakes liberal back home while destroying millions of non-Americans.
"Black and Brown girls..."ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Would someone tell Biden it's 2020 not 1920...
Were the Biden/Harris speeches as inspiring as I found them to be or has it just been that long since we‚Äôve heard presidential-level speeches given?   My suspicion is the answer is yes.
I am a life long Republican who wouldnt vote for Trump again if Biden added the skeletol remains of jeffrey epstein as his VP.  Its not a left v right thing. Never has been and never will be. üòé
The event was the first in a rollout that Biden aides say blends the historic nature of Harris‚Äô selection with the realities of the 2020 campaign and the gravity of the nation‚Äôs circumstances.
Go ahead I‚Äôll wait for your facts bro. Google isn‚Äôt a friend of Trump so what do you have!? Nadda. Tell me one thing Biden has done for this country. Nadda. I have a list of things Trump is doing FOR our country not TO our country.
Like Biden is as we speak? Lol ass
Yeah, because Biden‚Äôs gonna lose!
Was Biden‚Äôs screen busted?
I am extremely happy. I think they are quite honestly the perfect pair. With Biden as the nom (not even in my top 5 btw), Warren needs to be Senate Majority Leader, Booker for HUD, Yang for Treasury
biden just trying to find the best smelling shampoo for what little hair he has left
Well it‚Äôs a good thing I‚Äôm not Joe Biden then. I am me. I
I know you are and I appreciate a conversation. We are far more similar than different in ideologies. Biden is a means to an end to the most disgusting chapter of American history since George W. Bush. Lots to do and little time to get it done. The planet needs us all.
Yes, the dead people overwhelmingly support Biden/Harris, perhaps because they have so much in common with Biden.
Well a third party sure is not going to win because the only 3rd party person who had a chance is  and he is supporting Biden/Harris
Most candidates run to the center in the general election. Biden is moving left.
True. Again, I‚Äôm looking for people that I don‚Äôt have to convince that science is real to work with going forward. If that means voting for Joe Biden, then so be it. Do I wish a more progressive ticket emerged? Absolutely! But it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll make lemonade instead of complain.
Oh, did I mention I interviewed Joe Biden... in Sheldon?  There's always a Sheldon connection.
Of course she will. She hates tRump so we know it will be Vice President Biden. Especially now having Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Additionally, Warren supporters were EVENLY SPLIT BETWEEN SANDERS AND BIDEN. Her dropping out wouldn't have made a bit of difference.  I like Sanders' ideas, but the candidate himself ran a bad campaign. How do I know?  BECAUSE BIDEN BEAT HIM FAIR AND SQUARE.
biden is not the enemy. harris is not the enemy. remember who and what we are up against. #BidenHarris2020

Joe Biden has chosen former rival Senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate. That story and more national news on KELOLAND This Morning. WATCH LIVE:
Kamala did great in the Iowa Caucus. Then again, Joe Biden got skunked so bad everyone assumed he was over. Nobody turned out for Joe. His rallies had five people in funeral homes.
I believe it actually hurts Trump. I've visited with dozens of MAGA who encountered those ads and then showed them how Joe Biden was to the right of Trump on issue after issue. They realized Trump's campaign was not honest.
My rule is to vote for the person with the best chance of winning who isn't an authoritarian or fascist or an enabler of the same. It's why, even though I don't love Biden, I will do everything I can to get him elected with a Democratic Senate.
All I know is Biden likes to be inappropriate with children and Harris loves locking us minorities up for life for non violent Weed charges
2000 Lieberman (Jewish) 2004 Kerry (Catholic) 2008 Obama (African-American), Biden (Catholic), Palin (woman) 2012 None of them were. Obama/Biden again, Romney (LDS), Ryan (Catholic) 2016 Clinton (woman), Kaine (Catholic) 2020 Biden (Catholic), Harris (African-American woman)
The ‚Äúradical‚Äù Biden/Harris ticket? ü§£ü§£ü§£
Kamala is Team Clinton's proxy. Bowed to Ma Clinton. Their best chance at retaining influence. That's probably the sole reason. If Biden wanted any backing from Clinton's then he was going to obey and pick their choice for VP.
Joe #Biden names Kamala Harris as running mate.  If you have a disability  and rely on #PlasticStraw to SURVIVE better stock up now! Anyone want to go out to eat with me while #PeopleWithDisabilities are still able to? #DisabledLivesMatter
People are talking about wanting seeing the Harris/Pence debate.  Really? What everyone wants is to see the Trump/Biden debate. Harris was a good pick, but the question still remains, hiw will Biden do in multiple head to heads against Trump, that are live.
He's also pushing the nickname "phony Kamala." If Biden wins, do you think Phony Kamala will end up in a match with the real Kamala? If so, will it be at the SoTU or Survivor Series?
I feel like not picking Elizabeth Warren was a huge mistake for Biden. #Biden's VP #VicePresident
I can‚Äôt vote for Trump. I won‚Äôt vote for Biden because he‚Äôs ‚ÄúnotTrump‚Äù.  Another Presidential election where I have no political home. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I really considered Biden early on. He‚Äôs a likable guy who doesn‚Äôt seem too extreme to me. But his obvious issues with dementia sealed the deal for me. If he is elected, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôll be doing the work of the Presidency.  And that‚Äôs just wrong.
History buffs: Has there ever been a case where the fascists were beaten by an economic elite by asking the people to vote for the fascists to kindly leave? Biden restoring the old capitalist order after Trump's neofascist rise would seem unprecedented.
I wouldn‚Äôt say she was doing a good job but either way, I‚Äôm very concerned if Trump wins again, and if Biden wins. Seems like a lose/lose for the country either way.
Absolutely and worse. Biden brings back the drugs capital got addicted to which gave us Trump. More Underclass destruction. Colonial aggression. Global corporate empowerment. We need rehab not a massive drug-fueled bender.
Say Trump continues to sabotage his campaign and somehow manages to lose to Biden/Harris. Joe rips open the military actions in Yemen, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Syria, agitates China. Inherits wrecked economy and bungles into Carter Malaise x1000.   What fascist do we get in 2024?
I‚Äôll say this as a Bernie guy...neither  Biden or Harris were high on any of my lists of preferred candidates.L, but I will PROUDLY #vote for the #BidenHarris2020 ticket. I‚Äôm voting for the future of this country and not the past of any single candidate. #BidenHarris #VPHarris
Biden doesn‚Äôt even realize he us running for President.  He thinks he is running for the Senate.
It's official: 2020 is Corporate Republican Biden/Harris vs Neofascist Theocratic Trump/Pence.
I understand why Republicans ran losers Bob Dole and Jack Kemp in 1996: they knew anyone was gonna lose to Clinton. But I don't get going with life-long loser Biden and primary loser Harris. Barack and the DNC picked the two least capable. It's a joke ticket. Truly tragic.
I'm confused. I figured you were just another BlueMAGA cheering Cop Lives Matter. Excited about Kamala and right wing Biden. But your wall seems to be defund cops. What's going on?
Joe Biden picked a Biden-like running mate and half my timeline seems pissed. Hope this holds. It might be a nice change from a timeline that's pissed at Noem for doing Noem-like things.
No kidding at all. They were elated. "Kamala's an even bigger loser than Biden and she's a back stabbing ******.". Direct quote from one. They're celebrating Trump's victory already.   We will see. I'm not convinced he wants to win either. Nobody seems to.
#VPPick #VPHarris Prediction: If Biden-Harris wins the election, Harris will become POTUS shortly after Jan. 2022 thru Biden's resignation or his removal under Amendment 25 Section 4.
Does Biden even know this yet?
How many allies responded to the Harris announcement with a shrug? It hit me that I'm so used to Joe Biden ALWAYS making the worst decision that the announcement was comfortably consistent. What was your reaction?
Picking Kamala was a predictably bad move for Biden- no demographic gains, plus he‚Äôs picking a prosecutor in the midst of this political climate. He‚Äôs cemented corporate neoliberalism for the next 8+ years in what‚Äôs the ultimate rebuke to the true left.
The Biden/Harris lineup makes sense. After all, Kamala was so terrible she was the first big name to drop out. And Joe bombed in all the initial primaries and had to be dragged across the SC finish line by Obama. It's the Lose/Lose ticket.
Looking forward to a Biden/Harris ticket. Is it perfect? Of course not.   Is it better than what we got right now? Hell yes.   So suck it up and vote in November like your life depends on it.  Because, well, it probably does.
So where does the assumption come that I support Biden?
His stament isn‚Äôt wrong. The presidential election will end with either end with President Biden or President Trump. Yes you can withhold your vote but that‚Äôs not an outcome of the national election but instead your own personal choice.
Do they really want to start going through who said horrible things about the Presidential pick? I‚Äôm pretty sure every single Republican has said way nastier then she ever did to Biden.
She also believes the 25+ women who have accused your father of sexual assault. Harris said she believed Biden made them uncomfortable. Not literally raped women like your Dad did.
Kamala Harris is a big W for the Biden campaign

Well... that's the little white lie we don't talk about. Biden got skunked everywhere. Fifth in Iowa. Failure everywhere... until Obama and Friends pulled every string, shoved everyone else out, and dragged his lifeless body across the red SC finish line. Declared it GAME OVER.
Too close to call right now primarily because while Biden theoretically has a huge lead, he has zero turnout intensity.
We already have a president that actually cares about us. You want to destroy America and keep us in poverty living in fear and filth. Biden can‚Äôt put clean underwear on the right way. No thank you.

Can we find anything to vote for Biden about? I doubt it.
Lololol at least he‚Äôs able. Hater. Biden can‚Äôt even pick a club. You want to pay more taxes go right ahead no one is stopping you. Me, fuck that. You can have nasty pilosi and her goon squad. I want a real president who can throw a first pitch and play a round of golf

The best thing you can do right now is vote for Trump. Biden literally hates black people, he always has. If you don't understand this you can look it up. He's been in power for decades, life never got much better, did it? lol.
YES!!!!! Go Biden!!!!!!
If Joe Biden is the answer, it must have been an incredibly stupid question!
Agreed. I blame Trump for all this.   And we likely won‚Äôt get football in the fall because of him either.   Only hope is Biden Team is putting plan together to get things in order on Day 1.

Or more accurately, we do the dirty to the young in this country. Capitalism enjoys the consumption of its young just as it's ancestral god Baal prescribed. From child groper Biden to Epstein club members Clinton and Trump, devouring the young is the entitlement of the Overclass.
Honestly surprised Biden remembers how to do that! I suppose there are something you never really forget. If only running a country were as simple as riding a bike, we'd be set!
So, the Dems drag POTUS for grammar &amp; spelling in his tweets but he tweets the way he speaks.  Biden on the other has a night &amp; day difference between his public speaking &amp; tweets.  There's no way in Hell he writes his own tweets.

That's a good suggestion. I wonder who else Biden might consider for State.
Apparently John Kasich is as far left as Joe Biden tolerates.
Yes, I saw a Biden ad last night. Here in RED South Dakota!
Trump at briefing: " Biden is now controlled by the Bernie Sanders left wing."
Yes. Both Republicans and Democrats are in strong unity in their colonial projects. Trump has gleefully carried forward the coups and illegal wars initiated under Obama via the Biden Plan for Latin America.
Good for him!!! When their union supports dumb Biden publicly, time to clean house.   Remember he knows more and is much more intelligent then you are..:.
And China wants Biden so they can get back the control they had with gay Obama.....they started this attack and people like you buy into the media control liberal agenda.
Biden will be our next president. And you‚Äôll still be an irrelevant has-been.
......you did hear what Biden just said right? lol. Oh man.
Love how its fake news when your proven wrong. Of course if you dont vote for Biden you ain't black.
Even better, on the off chance that he doesn't get re-elected, Biden will be forced to rescind this EO.
Given Chomsky's message of "Your feelings don't matter. Suck it up and vote for Biden to get rid of Trump," I'd value his analysis on why the more pro-Empire colonialist candidate is the one the Left must back. Sure, Trump is a mess.
bailout for people not for a stupid remodeling of the west wing. let Joe Biden deal with that when he‚Äôs in office in January
Other than a weak coup in Bolivia and sustaining actions on Obama/Hillary/Biden war projects, what has Empire devoured lately? It's got to be incredibly hungry for new blood. Long list of nations ready for the colonial hammer for a Biden/Rice admin.
I've learned the following from of the new pack: - Biden is 100% for M4A - Biden is anti interventionist. A dove, not a hawk - Biden was a stronger champion for BLM than Bernie because he had friends like John Lewis  Many good new accounts. Some clearly working for Biden effort.
I just had a thought: maybe it's someone's elderly grandmother an she was happy to have the Biden Loves Me #BLM next to her Joe Biden 2020 sign? üòÅ
I've been hearing the term 'Joe Biden and the democrats' so often, it's starting to sound like a band name like Gem and the holograms.
The South Carolina Morning News reported that Father Robert E. Morey of Saint Anthony Catholic Church denied Biden communion because of the presidential candidate and lifelong Catholic‚Äôs aggressive pro-abortion beliefs. ‚Äú
Except in the Biden Campaign, it's not. That's who's running and funding Joe.
Naturally, a brand new August 2020 account immediately going after leftists.  Like come on, Biden campaign - even Amway scammers accosting you in the airport aren't that obvious.
If you're for Joe Biden, you're not a leftist. If you're claiming to be a leftist for joe, you're gaslighting. That's a block.
Absolutely key to understanding why Joe Biden is far right of Reagan and Elliot Abrams in being pro-coup, anti-democracy in Latin America. In this 80s hearing Joe castigates Reagan for being too soft on the Sandinistas whom Joe wanted overthrown.
It's pretty horrifying. The Biden Plan for Latin America has overthrown so many governments. Too few know the whole refugee crisis that led to Trump's wall issue and victory was caused by Bidens anti-democratic interventions.
The Biden sign may be a local ordinance requirement for any BLM signage. Remember, "you ain't Black" if you aren't backing Biden, in his own words.
Navarro is a Contra sympathiser and anti-democratic ghoul. This news further validates concerns that a Nicaragua coup or war is on the top of Joe Biden's agenda.
Obama and Biden didn't do a thing during H1N1 for over 6 months. Of those 160,000, over 53000 are from nursing homes in states with Dem govs who forced covid+ patients into NHs. Biden has no empathy. Hes behind the '94 crime bill that disproportionately imprisoned black community
Already blocked two of them after they gaslighted claiming Biden is backing #M4A and isn't a colonial interventionist. One has a long history of faking leftist and then getting into nasty fights. Quality mutuals are what I'm interested in.
here's an idea, QUIT TELLING LIES! do your DAMN JOB and actually BE a good leader! until you get your act together, i'm NOT voting for you this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Joe Biden will NOT be hurting God..YOU are hurting God by being a stupid ass bitch baby!!!!
Trump is going to work hard to leaving the biggest mess he can for Biden to clean up to hurt his image and success
Wait... is Joe Biden a Republican?
even if biden wins he‚Äôs going to lose
Good analysis on unelectable Joe Biden,  Passing along a correction. Barack Obama is unquestionably and objectively a Baby Boomer, both by established definitions (Gen X starts at 1965, Obama born in 1961) and value systems.
Biden is flaming garbage, I agree.
Nice, what if Biden's handlers choose a white straight male?
Hahaha both of these guys are just ridiculous. I firmly believe the democratic party put Biden through because they want Trump to win. The liberal media is making so much damn money shitting on him every day. Whether he actually says something ridiculous or not
They're annoying AF. Got hounded by several of the new 1000+ comrades who insisted that Biden will back #M4A as "the bill is entered into congress already" and also gaslit on Biden changing his foreign policy. I went commando block on those trolls. We're being played hard.
No wonder Biden's people keep him mostly in hiding. The Democrats could not have picked a worst candidate
President Donald Trump billed his trip to Ohio Thursday as a chance to promote economic recovery, but he quickly pivoted to a deeply personal attack on Joe Biden, even questioning without foundation the former vice president's faith in God.
Biden‚Äôs actions show him to be filled with empathy, Trump, the opposite. Likely only one of the two has read the Bible. Only one uses the Bible as a prop.
And he talks about Biden not speak8ng well.
I would live to see Biden have to prove the existence of Corn Pop
I'm simply astounded anyone expects magic from Biden. He's very clear who he is, who funds his agenda, and who he obeys. On Latin America/intervention, you've GOT to get up to speed. Joe was the architect of the Biden Plan for Latin America that overthrew many governments, etc.
How do we explain to a new #ComradesUnder1k that Joe Biden has said he will veto #M4A and that means it is dead if he's president (unless he changes his mind and tells his donors running his campaign)? I'm not getting thru and am sensing a BlueMAGA gaslighting account. Thoughts?
Your questions are incoherent. Do you not know how legislation is passed? What part of Joe Biden saying he would veto M4A if passed don't you get?
Do you really believe Joe Biden would permit M4A? Let's not dance around with semantics. He's opposed every aspect of it and said there's no way to pay for it. We all know who butters his bread per insurance lobby. "It ain't happening, man!" is what Joe would tell you.
You must not be following this issue. You need to get engaged if you actually are holding out hope of Joe Biden, funded by Big Insurance, etc., with corporate lobbyists directing his campaign, would ever back M4A. Not my job to educate you, comrade. Fair enough?
Lots of bills sit in Congress. That's part of the game. Means absolutely nothing. Worse, Biden's promised he would veto it as president if it ever saw the light of day. That's what we're talking about. Biden defending for profit Big Insurance.
Sorry  I guess you won‚Äôt be puppeting Biden since your Russian interference will be squashed!
Do not, for even a moment, think that #JoeBiden ‚Äòs gaffes, radical views or hypocrisy will deter #Democrats from nominating and electing him. #Trump2020  Biden raises eyebrows with remark contrasting African American, Latino diversity
Wait, so Biden has a Hattori Hanzo sword???
He‚Äôs got more cognitive ability than Biden
