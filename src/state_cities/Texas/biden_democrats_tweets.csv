Pompeo hit with subpoena after he‚Äôs caught assisting Senate GOP‚Äôs political smear of Biden
She embellished her record slightly.  I didn't think that was a big red flag.  I think she's probably telling the truth about a lot of it.  Biden should be more forthcoming.  If Trump wasn't a pathological sociopath, ...
There are pictures as well. The mainstream media doesn‚Äôt care about the truth. We have a videotape of Biden bragging about committing extortion and bribery and the media looked the other way.
Xavier, are countless photos and videos of Biden being grotesquely innapropriate with women and children not proof? All you have to do is click on Biden‚Äôs tweet and an influx of replies will show you such pictures and videos. THAT was all I was saying.
Dude I‚Äôm not here to argue, I was here to state how I feel. I gladly welcome any new evidence, research, and opinions. But this was never a debate on Biden v Trump. This was a clear tweet about Biden only. Stop assuming shit and putting words in my mouth.
Oh so it turned out to be a win-win for Biden and lose-lose for Trump. Nice. Fox really went after that so they are really eating crow as of recently.
If bush endorses Biden Biden flips Texas.
Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk were just some of the names who were impacted by the hack.
And how many Latinos or people of color are in Trump‚Äôs cabinet (besides sell out Ben Carson)? Trump is full of crap, Biden will have people of all races in his üëçüèΩüëèüèΩ
I literally just said that i wasn‚Äôt saying he was any better but that I personally didn‚Äôt know of any hard proof evidence against Trump like there is Biden. I can‚Äôt question the validity of evidence between the two of them without automatically being pinned as a Trump supporter?
See that‚Äôs a problem. I didn‚Äôt say a word about Trump. And I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs any better, but there‚Äôs literal photos and videos of Biden. What is there of Trump beside allegations? Again, not saying he‚Äôs not guilty, but I‚Äôm a proof kind of girl. I like to see it for myself.
Joe Biden has pictures and videos all over the internet showing that AT BEST, he is creepy af towards women and children. At WORST, he could very well be a pedophile... so this isn‚Äôt a debate of Trump vs. Biden.
Has Biden mentioned ranked choice voting?  Why not? Could it be he wants the two-party stranglehold that perpetuates the us Vs. them crapfest? ...
And you know they‚Äôll be rejecting all of those with Biden at the top.
Name one thing Joe Biden has done for white Americans.
Obama gave political speech at a funeral. What a shame. What he has done for blacks when he was president. What he is doing now in his private life for blacks. Trump has done more for blacks than Obama‚Äôs entire life. Obama, Biden, Hillary and Pelosi all worshiped KKK Robert Byrd
Not knowing Biden‚Äôs VP is stressing me out more than it should
After reading the court documents this is no different then joe Biden and Ukraine, and the Clinton foundation exact same thing.. amazing the 2 tiered justice stystem..
The viruses were introduced , there are predictable time tables .. Given Joe Biden‚Äôs association closely with China .. it is not far fetched to put together a perfect storm to crush trump..
Is Biden not a Trojan Horse for the New Democrats? That‚Äôs the question.
. on  discussing  reelection campaign, and  socialist agenda. [AUDIO]
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong on Biden being the middle ground. But I think that‚Äôs what gets him elected and then his progressive VP will get the office when Biden ‚Äústeps down‚Äù or is forced out. You think he‚Äôll be able to serve 4 years? He just doesn‚Äôt come across healthy, man.
Trump has been a grifter his entire life.  Biden sucks on money stuff, no doubt.  He's not pro-abortion up to 9 months.  No one is 'pro-abortion'. There are certain rare cases where the mother's life may be in danger where exceptions are made.  ...
The word ‚Äúlegally‚Äù is doing a lot of work there, especially when you consider Trump‚Äôs violent mercenaries beating and gassing Americans in the streets for trying to exercise their rights
This didn‚Äôt age well.
I‚Äôll let you know if Biden is an option when he names his VP. My fear is the Democrats will find Biden unfit to serve shortly after the election and his VP will be in charge. I‚Äôll let you know once we know who that is.
He's looking for legal immunity.  That's what Biden and Pelosi and McConnell will eventually be forced to grant him so we can end this nightmare.
Joe Biden is expected to accept the party‚Äôs presidential nomination on the final night of the convention.
Lubbock County Democratic Party has Joe Biden signs available. Donations are strongly encouraged.  If you would like one, please call us at 806-749-8683.
Trump has more rape cases against him and the stuff on Biden turned out to be false. And whose name did epstein have in the book? Hmmmm not Biden but Trump...trumps even admitted liking young girls. Back your stuff up with some facts...
Oh, and keep yelling in Biden's face about ranked choice voting.  Why on Earth hasn't he mentioned this?  No one likes the two-party system...
How does it guarantee a more competent fascist?  Progressives should gear up 3 or 4 candidates to run against Biden in 4 years.  2 or 3 drop out before Super Tuesday (pull a Klobuchar/Buttigieg).  Let's see what happens.
Biden is a 1 term guy, and he's looking for someone to succeed him. He will pick a strong candidate, Harris or otherwise.
There was renewed speculation Tuesday that Biden would choose California Sen. Kamala Harris after an Associated Press photographer captured handwritten notes Biden held with her name across the top, along with a list of talking points about her.
You‚Äôre like joe Biden but with Latin ppl
*One* thing I like better.  I don't want to see Biden at any correspondents' dinners.  There's no reason to be so chummy with people that are supposed to be holding you accountable. One thing Trump did right IMO.
The latest polls show Texas is a toss up between Trump and Biden. Do you think Trump's visit to Midland will shore up Texas support?
Have a hard time believing there‚Äôs a large base waiting to see who Biden picks as his VP to determine if they‚Äôll vote for him.
Right.  Prohibition doesn't work.   We tried this 100 years ago.  It's ridiculous we even have to think about it.   But that's Biden.   Won't even get behind something 80% of the country wants...
Even Republicans are for this.  The only one who isn't is Biden.
I would imagine Gideon would benefit from ranked choice...  Why again hasn't Biden embraced ranked choice? What's wrong with him?
I mean, it‚Äôll be 2 of 7 if Biden is elected and I feel like counting Pence is unfair.  And two of them (Quayle and Cheney) never ran.
Be realistic...Biden and Obama will never go to jail ..many will take the bullet for them ...
Holy crap I remember Twitter in the early 2010s and instead of the leftist weirdos attacking Biden it was all the guys with header photos of Obama tearing up the Constitution.
I figured that a lot of them were people who had no stakes in the election.  It doesn't make sense why somebody who has to live in this country would allow the possibility of Trump over something as trivial as the difference between M4A and Biden's health care plan.
Freddo, you joe Biden get confused from time to time.... Gov Cuomo mishandled the COVID response by sending COVID positive ppl to nursing home causing the death of thousands in his state! #FakeNews #freddo
Ah, okay, so Biden's endorsing Medicare For All minus the stupid parts and the Bernie left says that's not good enough.
I sort of wonder if some voters are pricing in the probability that Biden will win.
A thing I've noticed on this site is that everybody spends more time talking themselves into why Trump might come back for no particular reason and very little time talking about the possibility that Biden's lead may get larger.
Biden would obviously win but allows Republicans to claim he doesn‚Äôt have a mandate.
No offense but it seems you like the democrats. BC if you support BLM your monies go to the blue site for Joe Biden campaign election funds. Sorry but Biden is nothing but a face on a puppet. He a pedophile he loves to touch little girls and Whispers in their ears
Okay, and what difference does this make as to whether Biden can sign bills into law on January 20
It's hard to watch bernie videos now. Knowing he won't be president. I mean trump or biden is the best we got? Jesus that's depressing.
Um, if you're referring to the tissue-thin conspiracy theory that was floated back in March, that fell apart the second any real scrutiny was paid to it  Her own lawyer dumped her, which is lawyer-speak for "This nutjob is full of shit"  Do try to keep up
Biden has his gaffes, but I would want to debate Trump for an hour if I were him...Trump isn‚Äôt going to follow Biden around the stage like he did Hillary and he‚Äôs still - even after 4 years - way in over his head on topics, won‚Äôt study, etc.
Why do Democrats defend violence and anarchy?  Joe Biden is taking the side of the violent anarchists and will not condemn the unlawful destruction and chaos brought to America‚Äôs cities by Antifa or Black Lives Matter.
Biden's got deep ties to Ukraine he was endorced by berny sanders the communist. Trumps got more money then he could spend in a lifetime. With him it comes down to being sewn into history as a success. Bidden incoherent and is the defintion of a puppet.
Drink the Kool-aid some more... maybe you can believe Biden really wasn't a racist homophobe in the 80s... seriously.
Biden will eradicate it but Trump will make it a new super strand
If Biden wins: the day after Election Day.   If Trump wins: the day after Election Day 2024
Do you people seriously not see the propaganda campaign let by the media. You guys are brainwashed into believing the billions of anti trump BS they say every other word. Even with a negative view of the man it's obvious he cant be controlled. Biden in the epitome of a puppet.
If Biden wins, we won‚Äôt have this issue much longer after election. If Trump wins... well, we will hear of this for even longer.
Its too important for Pelosi to wash her hands of this. Trump may run the administration, but she has a major role... And for the record... Bengazi and the email server were baseless political theater. So was Ukraine. Bounties a joke.Trump? I'd vote for a good Dem alt - not Biden
And yet the Democratic nominee implemented some of the most hurtful racist policies in the past 30 years, halted school segregation... mandated busing, 80s crime bill... Ask Kamala
Biden literally took credit for busing legislation, a crime bill that incarcerated African Americans at record rates, and gave the keynote eulogy at America's most famous segregationist senator. Ask Kamala Harris what she thinks!
I have a hard time with all of Biden's possible VP picks, but because Biden cannot lose Florida I think  Karen Bass is out.
Yeah, and Biden isn‚Äôt exactly somebody lacking in foreign policy cred, either.
can you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting my big ass spanked by Joe Biden!!!!
Fuck Kamla Harris, and Fuck Joe Biden, sorry you guys are settling for some bullshit, but I won't, earn my fucking vote #Bernieorbust
Everyone thinks voting trump out will end end thisFascism, bit in reality Joe Biden had a heavy hand in creating the current police state, and I refuse to let covert Fascism back into our lives #Bernieorbust
I am not a fan of Joe Biden, and normally would vote Green or Socialist. But this is so important that I will vote Biden this November: How the global #climate fight could be lost if Trump is re-elected #ClimateChange
100000% False  dose not give a crap about people look at  Biden the racists he only likes unions., #VotingBlueisracist #VotingBlueKills #Trump2020VictoryNowMoreThanEver
But there would have to be a ton of issues for a 10-point-ish lead to turn into a loss based on that.  Like why would you assume mail-in ballot problems disproportionately hurt Biden?
This is Pelosi and Biden wish for America. That‚Äôs why the LameStream Media doesn‚Äôt report on what is actually happening. Obama, Biden, Pelosi, etc will soon be indicted for Treason!
Nope.   Biden won because people like James Carville got on TV and scared a bunch of old folks about socialism üò±üò±üò± They don't know what they're supposed to be afraid of,  but God Carville said it, so...
Joe Biden is your guy- Bush's drug plan ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time‚Äù  You can have him.
Where is that sign? Texans need to come out and vote for Joe Biden for President!!! djt has tried to put up his wall on out border. What a waste of money!
Rhetorical question.  would never agree to this. Nothing to gain and everything to lose. Much Like Biden in a debate with DJT.
Had she been the nominee, and picked a young (non AOC) progressive... she would have won hands down... with Biden on the top of the ticket... Trump better win this or god help us.
I wonder why Biden did not want to do an interview.
When will the LameStream Media,   etc, actually investigate the fact that Obama, Biden and their staff speed on Trump during his Campaign and after he was Elected President? Are LameStream Media scared of the TRUTH? Who‚Äôs paying LameStream Media not to investigate
Was he better than Hillary Clinton... I think so... she would have been impeached in the first congressional term and hell broken loose. But for god's sakes why Biden this time... there are lots of independents that could get behind someone of merit. Just so depressing.
Joe Biden is a moron.
I think I would rather have Biden as President with a Republican Senate than Trump with a full Democratic congress.
The President is intent on keeping capitalism going here in the U.S. while Joe Biden wants us to ditch that and go become a communist country.I like having the opportunity to build my capital. Don‚Äôt you?
Quick question, do you think Joe Biden would make any of these situations better?
President Trump has almost doubled his support among Black voters.  He was elected in 2016 with 08% of the Black vote.  Trump is now receiving support from 14% of Black voters, with 09% still undecided.  Receiving 16% of the Black vote would insure his victory over Joe Biden.
The two presidential campaigns dump millions of dollars every week into Facebook and Google ads
and the MSM started down the scary üò±üò±üò±üò±socialism route and we ended up with Biden...  The moneyed interests won. They're fine with whoever wins- they'll keep their give aways.
I'm voting green cause not even Obama believes in Joe Biden, even though obama put him their üòë and before you voter shame, dont split the vote! Vote green if your that worried about splitting the vote, this is a democracy not a godsam handout, earn my fucking vote.
Holy Shit Texas!   I don‚Äôt watch much TV, but I just saw a Biden ad and I‚Äôm in one of the reddest parts of Texas!!  This tells me Texas is really up for grabs this year.   So all you wonderful Blue Texans, don‚Äôt take your vote for granted.   Vote Biden!!
You never answered my question. What has he done to the COUNTRY that is so bad? The only articles you brought up were about his checkered past which, every politician has! You have shown nothing to prove why Biden would be the lesser of 2 evils
Okay?  I mean I like Biden just fine but I‚Äôm voting for him mainly because I want Trump gone.
So does that mean that if you vote for Joe Biden, who was caught on camera multiple times sniffing children and touching them inappropriately, you‚Äôre a bad person as well?ü§î
Trump‚Äôs a dirtbag...but he acts just like this to those who follow him as well.  ...and Biden is on multiple videos literally telling people to vote for someone else because he doesn‚Äôt want to talk to them. Not sure how that shows he cares for all constituents.
I wish all 350,000 of my followers would cut and paste this and tweet it out right now:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
that Hillary won the 2016 primary, something that seemed lost on every candidate not named Joe Biden
Biden v Trump
Biden ad airing during the Diamondbacks-Padres game on FS1.
Remember, we have video of Biden bragging about committing extortion and bribery in Ukraine and the mainstream media looks the other way.
I would like to announce that my sister, who is 56 years old and a life-long Republican, told me today she will be voting for Joe Biden in this election. And we live in Texas. I am very proud and optimistic.
Beat Biden off? üòè
Better yet.... who‚Äôs Biden?
You- 'I'm scared of scary deficits üò±üò±üò±' Trump says he's not scared (of course he always lies both ways) Biden- 40 yrs of being scared of scary deficits.  You- ??? I like the person who doesn't agree with me.  Me- You're incoherent.
Hahaha yeah let‚Äôs be real your either voting against Trump or for Biden‚Äôs vp because Biden in completely out to lunch.
You're the one who said she was scared of deficits üò±üò±üò± Which Biden has been harping about for 40+ years...  Apparently, he's your guy...
‚Äúthe great American middle that it could disrupt Joe Biden‚Äôs seemingly clear glide path to the White House. It‚Äôs unnerving to them, and they‚Äôre trying to change the plotline. And because they dominate the airwaves, their narrative is working in the short term.‚Äù
The ride may get bumpy, but Texas can flip to blue and put Biden in the White House.
Stop letting no-liberals like Biden scare you...
Black Lives Matter has taken over many large Democrat-controlled cities. Black Lives Matter has taken over Joe Biden and the Democrat Party. Black Lives Matter, Joe Biden, and the Democrat Party are Marxists supporting the Chinese Communist Party and anarchy in the United States.
Yes, there are always trade offs. But I would much rather live near wind turbines than a coal mine or fracking wells: Biden plots $2tn green revolution but faces wind and solar backlash #ClimateChange #cleanenergy
You have no idea other than 'Democrats bad' 'Socialism bad'  It's all identity politics.   You should love Joe Biden.  He wants to continue Trump's love of the drug companies.  You got your wish.   Four more years of the same...
If Biden wins, you guys aren‚Äôt going to bust all the windows out of Vingo Vineyards, burn down Western Implement, and loot A to Z?!
Need to keep pushing for ranked choice voting so third parties have a viable chance.  Haven't heard Biden even mention it.  Not a good sign. How much better would this election be with ranked choice voting?
From what I heard, Murdock Jr. is in charge and sent Biden a big donation.......your guess is right.
Getting rid of Thurston Howell V is enough to vote Biden.
Pelosi always says ‚ÄúNo one is above the law‚Äù! She is. Here‚Äôs a list: Hillary, Podesta, Lerner, Lynch, Page, Ohr, Strozh, McCabe, Clapper, Brennan, Comey, Rosenstein, Huma, Biden, and Obama.
If anything, Biden appears to be working to accommodate the Bernie left much more than the Lincoln Project.
As expected, the media is falling all over itself to declare Trump ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù now that he has managed to change his tone on the coronavirus. Folks, Biden does not have this thing in the bag. The media wants to write the Trump comeback story SO BADLY, and they‚Äôll prop him up.
But the phrase ‚ÄúPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.‚Äù is getting an unlikely moment in the spotlight as President Donald Trump has taken a detour into the politics of dementia three months before the election.
I wish all Resistance to follow this Twitter account and on YouTube! Seeing republicans (past and present) put country above party and all supporting  Joe Biden for president gives me hope in American Democracy again!
Somebody leaked his name as Obama‚Äôs VP pick right before they announced Biden and Edwards just played along.
I just saw a Biden ad on ESPN.
so the 2016 election (primary and general) appears to have made some people on the right smarter (being Never Trump means you no longer have to spin stupid shit) while also making some on the left dumber (because you gotta make a case that Hillary and Biden are bad)
Which is why Biden should introduce a new, American calendar, making it January of 01 AT.
The ride may get bumpy, but Texas can flip to blue and put Biden in the White House.
Please stop it! So did HRC last time around and you media people are still falling for it. üòÇ   Fox News Poll: Biden tops Trump in battlegrounds Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania
Bad decision. I wonder now that Rupert's son is in charge and gave a big donation to Biden how many more lying cheats will grace their airwaves.
Lubbock County Democratic Party has Joe Biden signs available. Donations are strongly encouraged.  If you would like one, please call us at 806-749-8683.
Obama blasts Trump, praises Biden in new 2020 campaign video
No one wants that!!! Biden actually believes guns are good.  Just more regulations and stipulations to make it harder for bad people to get.  Don‚Äôt think it was socialists, think it was the need to cut gun touting criminals out and my research says it was bipartisan.
If Biden puts AOC in charge of the EPA, why the hell did we pick him over Bernard?
Together, we will beat John Cornyn, flip the State House, break the supermajority in the State Senate, expand our Congressional delegation, and deliver 38 electoral votes to send Joe Biden to the White House.
Live in very red west Texas. Very few signs up. I need to get a Biden sign. And Hegar. Not sure we've hit the tipping point yet, but hope springs eternal. #TurnTexasBlue
The Democrat Party wants to become a power like the Chinese Communist Party, with forced abortions and reeducation camps.  Joe Biden is making that abundantly clear by his unwavering support and admiration of the Chinese Communists.
That woman has dementia worse than Biden
not really, Bush wasn‚Äôt (technically) the incumbent.  I also doubt Biden will take any silly photo ops in a tank.
it‚Äôs not, Biden‚Äôs decision to ignore the Very Online Left is why he‚Äôs the nominee.
Joe Biden and Barack Obama are stepping up their attacks on President Donald Trump.
This would NEVER be Joe Biden‚Äôs America!! It belongs only to djt!!!LOL rigged I see. If Biden happens to win all you morons are gonna do is blame Mail in voting and say the machines were rigged just like you did with Obama.
There is nothing good about dividing our country, or making an ass out of himself on Twitter and TV. While I‚Äôm not exactly the biggest Joe Biden fan I could tolerate his administration a lot more than Trump, and this is coming from a Bernie Sanders voter.
Without poorly Trump is handling this coronavirus thing and that fact he‚Äôs concerned that he is losing popularity he‚Äôs scared. Also too last time a lot of people didn‚Äôt see Trump for the monster that he is and if this Coronavirus crap gets getting out of hand Biden may win.
At $600 per week in additional benefits and another &amp;1200/, you will DESTROY the USD. I will actively and with $$$$$ fight for Joe Biden. How dare you acquiesce to this!?
Did anyone ask if Biden would be disloyal to Obama?  Didn‚Äôt think so
Seriously, I will be so much calmer when I never have to hear  voice ever, ever again. And I pray on inauguration day, he just takes a pass and leaves before Biden is sworn in. The less I see of him, the better.
You used to love Bernie Sanders before Joe Biden became the nominee what happened. He wasn‚Äôt crazy Bernie before and you said Bernie was a good person and you were hoping he would be the nominee So what the hell happened?
Teen arrested for cryptocurrency hack of Obama, Biden Twitter accounts  via
I mean, I disagree with his politics but young Joe Biden is pretty hot
Your vote means nothing if you vote for shit like Biden or Trump. It only means something if you vote for what you stand for. Otherwise you are just a stooge for the Republicans and Democrats.  And don't be fooled, they are the same.
Y‚Äôall are pathetic Biden has a chance to win just like I have a chance for my dog to pick up its own poop
Joe Biden Models New GOTV Shirt
Duck Dynasty Star Says Joe Biden is a ‚ÄúHypocrite‚Äù Who Claims to be Christian But Supports Abortion
Notice they are bringing back the Obama faithful! Biden = 4 more years of Obama‚Äôs haneous policies that were so bad for America.
That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre not emotionally invested with trump like others. To them he can never do no wrong. I really don‚Äôt care who goes down. I don‚Äôt view anyone as a hero. Trump will save himself over before anyone else.
Sure bitch.
He sort of holds the highest position in the country right now. lol.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. All the people on the list would be fantastic as the VP. Just pick one of them and get this show on the road.  That's it. That's the Tweet.
We now know that Biden was prescient, accessing information about things before they happened.
To bad he won't be around to see it.  The votes will be tallied on electon night and only states that are too close to call may run over a day or two. When Biden wins he will be removed from office on January 20, 2021. His lawsuit won't do him any good.
Oh I know. üò¢üíî
I could use this strain about now. üò∑üò≥üò∑üò≥
I think I‚Äôll feel a LOT safer in President Biden‚Äôs America than I have in the past 3 and a half years under Pretendident Trump‚Äôs cruel and incompetent
‚ÄúLife is a slam dunk when you living with low goals‚Äù -  - Joe Biden probably ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
He didn‚Äôt. The states will run the election, he will lose, and if he‚Äôs still in the White House when Biden becomes president, I will watch the Secret Service drag him out
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders‚Äôs spending and Warren‚Äôs antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm
Surely No One possibly believes that Biden would be the Real President if elected. Maybe Clinton, Obama, Someone, but not him. Was never the plot.
‚ÄúNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we‚Äôll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,‚Äù Mr. McConnell said.
Lol even the ‚Å¶ leaders disagree with trump postponing the elections üíÄ
Nice meme. Could put Obama, Biden, Bush, Clinton (both), Pelosi, Schumer and many more before putting Trump on it.  How‚Äôs that TDS doing? Must take your medicine before it drives you crazy üòú
Trump continues to try to tap into the ‚Äúfears and anger and resentment of people...and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.‚Äù
Mr. Obama spoke about how Mr. Trump has a core base that ‚Äúfilters out any contradictory information.‚Äù
Sweety the first thoughts are okay but there really aren't any progressives, including Biden.
Mr. Obama was asked what keeps him up at night these days. He cited fears of voter suppression and an effort by Mr. Trump to question the election‚Äôs legitimacy.
Mr. Trump has no authority to unilaterally change the date of the election, which is set by federal law. His suggestion comes as polls show him trailing far behind Mr. Biden in surveys of nearly all of the key battleground states.
On Thursday, for the first time, Mr. Trump in a tweet suggested the vote be delayed ‚Äúuntil people can properly, securely and safely vote,‚Äù something he cannot legally do.
Everyone thinks so but Joe Biden.
Welcome to the pilot of the Democrat Inquisition 2.0. The witnesses at the Salem Witch Trials were afforded more rights. Under Biden political and policy differences become a state crime ... mob justice.
I really can't understand why you and those like you think Biden could possibly win. The Crime Syndicate is backing him as their token so they, at some point can takeover the people.
As ive said, I‚Äôm 66 &amp; I will crawl through broken glass &amp; Covid spit to vote for Joe Biden &amp; vote Blue up &amp; down the ticket. I hate Donald.
Trump Supporters Way More Enthusiastic About Voting Than Biden Backers
What if Joe Biden gets it? Who will become the Democrat candidate?
This old man Biden is as crazy as a loon.  He needs to be in an ALZHEIMERS Unit in a good nursing home NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.  He does not know if he is coming or going!! This IS SAD BUT TRUE!  He is too dumb to be President!!
Mr BIDEN LIES ON TELEVISION ALMOST EVERYTIME HE IS ON TELEVISION.  He need to talk for himself besides taking scripts from THE DEMOCRATS.  This guy could not a DAIRY QUEEN much less THE NATION. He needs to be in an ALZHEIMERS UNIT IN A NURSING HOME.  He is a STOOGE!
Ohhh I'll still vote Biden. I'm not happy about it but, it's very much a giant douche and turd sandwich scenario.
I mean, I hate Trump but I don't especially love Biden.
You should just stick to speaking for Florida.Joe Biden is blue and as crooked as the come. We have all seen he quid pro quo video with Ukraine. He can care less about anyone but himself. There is no way he is winning Texas.
And the rest of America yawned ... Jayapal is an incompetent joke. They defied Trump, so it will be equally easy to defy Biden.
You would rather have Joe Biden as your president!  God help us
A trip to London or Paris.  Voting for Biden.
Yet Biden is over here sniffing little kids and touching them  #bidenisapedophile #bidendementia #BidenRapist
You can't even spell Biden right üòÇ
This is happening now in Trump's America. BIDEN IS NOT PRESIDENT YET. So is America Great Again? Smh
Elon Musk for Biden VP
The president has started spending more money on ads in much smaller Electoral College prizes like Iowa and Nevada, and in recent days his campaign stopped buying ads in Michigan entirely.
No but disappointed that #Murdoch gave millions to Biden. No more  for me.
Unfortunately the owner of your network supports Biden so I‚Äôve turned off
Secretly they are hoping Biden wins. May even vote for him just so they can escape the madness that is Donald Trump.  Of course they won't admit it. Of course by lying, they are sort of shoveling the dirt into the hole.
Mind your own business. Trust me you won‚Äôt want to be our neighbor if Biden wins.
THIS MAN SHOULD BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENTIAL PICK. He is the only person that can keep the USA from falling to COMMUNIST AND SOCIALIST.  JOE BIDEN IS A SOCIALIST DEMOCRAT THAT IS BENT ON DESTROYING  AMERICA. His ALZHEIMERS would keep him from performing his duties! TRUMP 20/20
Questions for Biden were really hard. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite color?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat state are we in?‚Äù
Voters trust Biden's handlers right now more than they trust Trump's handlers &amp; both men need handling.  Politicians who side with the protesters I think will,  on the Wednesday after the Nov. vote,  wish they had been a little more George Patton &amp; a little less George McGovern
I‚Äôm with you.  I think fauci will look a lot like Biden-political and demented
Joe Biden holds rallies in the meeting hall of a community center and stands there in silence. Trump holds rallies in stadiums and stands amidst a thundering roar of America-loving patriots.
Remember Tian, that Obama began Asia pivot, an idiotic encirclement exercise, on the basis of State Dept advice; those folks are still there.   We'll see if Biden has the guts to walk back the nonsense.
I hate to say this but watching Biden take questions from reporters is painful. He looks so weak..
I would vote for a moldy bowl of fruit before comrade orange. But goodness me, Biden is a bit of a wreck. But I guess at least he acts like an adult. Ouff, we need better politicians.
You could show Biden's speech later! The Hearing is NOW! I hate FOX  I'm done! There are other sources I can listen to hearing! The absolute idiocy of Hearing should be shown! FOX isn't reporting news It's trying to control narrative!
My god! You interrupt this discussion to show Biden something that could be reviewed later FOX just turns my stomach! I turned you off! You're trying to control the narrative!!
A vote for anyone other than Biden is a vote for Trump.  You must then believe it is better having four more years of Trump rather than your progressive agenda on a party platform.  Work to progress your agenda, but do not work to put our democracy at risk.
The plan calls for dedicating $30¬†billion worth of previously proposed government investments to a small business opportunity fund benefiting black, brown and Native American entrepreneurs.
Mr. Biden will deliver his address in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday afternoon, where he is expected to sketch out how fighting systemic racism is integral to a range of his economic proposals, from housing to infrastructure to supporting small businesses.
No matter how many times Mr. Trump proves himself incapable of changing political stripes, the notion that he might seems to persist.  Not so amazingly, his sober posture did not last.
Biden isn‚Äôt perfect and wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice, but seriously?
They were using their way to tell America and the people around them that if people don‚Äôt wake up and start paying attention and you were to vote for Joe Biden that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre gonna be living under, Notsi ruled oppression
In the recent Fox News poll, even voters 65 and over disapproved of Trump‚Äôs response to the coronavirus, 51 percent to 48 percent. Forty-four percent strongly disapproved. Those are dangerous numbers for the president.
That‚Äôs just good for joe biden. She‚Äôs a terrorist. As a ploy-that could get Biden votes
Maybe it's just taking a while to get all of the charges in order before the targeted people are rounded up.  Regardless, something needs to be done soon.  It would be a dereliction of duty and devastating if it's not done and the unthinkable happens-Biden wins.
Really sad. Wouldn‚Äôt wish what Biden has on anyone.
Its Biden trying to keep you down and silenced
Did ya' think Biden would have anything good to say 'bout it?
Dude, where have you been?  Trump is trying to open schools and Biden and Dems want them closed.  What do you not get?
Chalupa -- she's the biggest one bcz her efforts got Trump's campaign manager, Manafort  fired in mid campaign for what was in that phony dossier.  What position will Hunter fill in the Biden  administration?
She‚Äôs right if Biden wins we‚Äôre gonna be living in a Nazi socialist country where they tell us what to do how to do it and when to do it so I can see her point
Let‚Äôs do this people! Joe Biden is the leader  we need to save us!!
I understand the thinking, but Biden and Dems need to do what‚Äôs best for the people and not let Trump and  drive this narrative.     I wish we can have 4 VPs!  So many great choices!

I dont care about biden. Whatever his problems are hes not as bad as trump. Trump also the guy who said if you don't test you won't have  coronavirus case. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ
There we go, then the statement I was annoyed by (that these images of current issues) somehow magically show up if Biden is president, are obviously false.  Glad we all agree!
Exactly, it‚Äôs why this is a stupid argument against Biden.  The one thing that‚Äôs different is baby fingers has been trying to address a hostile situation with more violence.
So then it‚Äôs not a valid statement that it would be Biden‚Äôs America.
When Joe Biden says that Donald Trump is the first racist president (it follows his supporters as well) he‚Äôs not saying that Trump hates black and brown people? And if Joe is making that claim, are his statements getting the attention they deserve?
Biden doesnt know who his people are! I guess his wife can tell him. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Indeed. Shame the democrats did not support a good candidate. However, Biden is the literal only option
Alright  still not convinced to vote for Trump though. I'd find it more compelling if Biden had a history of marching government troops into states against their will. But, if you feel the opposite, please vote for Trump, and don't waste it on an unlikable 3rd party in our system
Okay, so you firmly believe that Biden will be worse than Trump? Thank you for the straight forward answer, it took a while though
Indeed, rehabilitation is bad. Now, can you prove that Biden will be worse than Trump? Will he engage in more Genocidal wars then Trump would conclusively? If so, I will change my vote. Otherwise there is only one viable option.
That doesn't answer my point about the argument really, and is moreover irrelevant. Will Biden engage in more genocidal wars then Trump?
There are two options in this election. Only two. If you can prove Trump is worse than Biden I will vote for Trump, otherwise, in order to forestall actual fascism I will be voting for Biden
Uh huh. A plurality of politicians and MOST AMERICANS supported the genociode (a source I read lists the Iraqi deaths at 2 million). I really can't consider that an argument. Do you believe for example, that Biden will engage in more genocidal wars then Trump?
Oh please choose Kamala Joe Biden! Pretty please!!!
funny how you are tied in Texas according to polls, but in NTX only Trump signs and flags fly. Nothing, absolutley nothing for crazy Joe Biden.

You damn right! I‚Äôm just talk about Biden
He‚Äôs just working for trump trying to take away votes from Biden so Trump will win...
Same message do not allow this fake law and order lie not be answered with the latest saying if you are elected there will be riots in the streets and saying this is Biden's America no this is Trumps America now.
Hi friend just me I want you to let our candidate know he has to answer this narrative that is being formulated by the criminal in chief stating that the current administration has riots in the street but this will be Biden's America if elected this Trump shit show
If you can prove Biden is worse than Trump, I will vote for Trump. Otherwise given that there are only real two electoral options as a leftist the only viable one is Biden
I hope Biden works to reverse those rulings but to do so he has to get his Corporate-leaning Democrats to follow the course and I am not sure they will be willing to do so.
I am so stressed out about the damn election knowing he will cheat, use outside influences to win even though so many are voting for Biden. I was so sure  Hilary would win last election. This is what scares the crap out of me every single day! Ya he is going to cheat!

That Biden would put himself up as anyone to lead us out of a pandemic! Nobody's gonna say that, Joe, nobody! Your skill set lies just below that of putting a puzzle together! You can nearly put one together, but not quite!
'Cause Biden's so sharp, the very picture of health, virility, pure manliness! And just looking at him we know there's no limit to his intellectual prowess, his knowledge of virtually everything including medical! Yeah, right!
Support Biden?  That‚Äôs funny.  I‚Äôm not sure if he can even spell his own name anymore...And what, exactly, are the ‚Äúlocal and state police‚Äù doing?  I generally DON‚ÄôT support more federal involvement with anything, however, when the local imbeciles refuse to do anything.
I‚Äôd say Schumer top of the list. Nancy forgot where it is. We‚Äôve seen Biden doing it in public. I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs Hillary. And it probably ain‚Äôt little boys.
Sen. Ron Johnson will not say where material to investigate Joe Biden is coming from, but a former pro-Russian lawmaker in Ukraine has said he is a source.
If Biden doesn't harass UK, Canada, etc on a regular basis as Trump &amp; Pompeo do, immediately you will see other countries retreating from anti China nonsense they only adopted under our pressure.

Right.  Vice President Biden -- where do you stand on Assange?    Do you agree with Hillary, who said he should be in prison for life?    Tell us now, before we vote.

I don‚Äôt agree with everything the Democratic Party does even though I am a member of the party, for example I didn‚Äôt agree with them choosing Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders, and I‚Äôm not into the PC Police shit either.
Without saying anything about any other candidates, why would you vote for Joe Biden? I‚Äôm interested to hear what they think is so great about Joe.
Biden‚Äôs proposal is to increase the tax rate for people making over 400k/year from...  Wait for it....  37% to 39.6%. The horror üò±

The real question is how much of this wokeness will stick to Biden.
Joe Biden calls Trump the country's 'first' racist president:  via  - Same old Dem rhetoric.  Not a bit of racism in Trump.  Absolutely no evidence of it.  There have been several racist presidents in the past.  One is a liberal icon - LBJ.
I sat out 2016.  If Biden takes the side of protesters against police I will sit out again this year.  But I am not opposed to federal troops interceding to curtail violent protesting &amp; to protect public spaces &amp; buildings.

Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden?
So if not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, and not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden, then by that logic, people that vote third party or don‚Äôt vote at all are voting for.... both of them?
Obama:one of histories most vile con men, and the fact that he is so revered by libs demonstrates the hopelessness of a Biden presidency and essentially dooms the US to more of the same .... if Biden wins, hence a worsening of a failed state.
But Biden called him racist and thought it was the wrong idea when President Trump closed down travel with China. Biden then had to walk back that position. So who was right?
Joe Biden‚Äôs crime bill is checking you out this very instant!
Tell that to the horse that constantly tells people to vote for the other horse when his policies are questioned.  Biden makes himself look bad. Pointing that out is just highlighting the damage he did to himself already.
Joe Biden is effectively shutting down that debate. He's not interested in single-payer at all. He's said so in so many words.  How the hell is calling him out on that "bad faith"? Your statements are more bad faith than Bri's.
"U.K. Officials‚Äô New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by Mark Landler via NYT

Any black person not on welfare and continuing to vote Democrat isn‚Äôt black remember. Biden said so.
Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
I‚Äôm confused. Do you and Eric think Joe Biden is an abducted child? Or did you confuse it with a Silver Alert? That would at least make sense. Haha he‚Äôs old. Is there an alert for narcissistic and corrupt millionaires?
Saw it. You don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm level of Biden when you read from the teleprompter. But I suppose it‚Äôs the only way to prevent you for sabotaging your own campaign.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.
I was half-expecting to see Joe Biden pop up from behind the casket and throw BIDEN t-shirts into the crowd.
No sane person would vote for Biden
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Don't ask that question homie... you know you only asked that because you feel guilty for getting paid by Biden and the Clinton/Obama administration
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
Are you trying to lose? All Biden has to do is saying nothing, and his numbers go up
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
Possibility 1; Biden is elected with Hillary Clinton as his V.P. and the Speaker of the House, Pelosi pushes the 25th amendment to rid the country of Biden and ...TA DA.. Hillary becomes President.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Absolutely not, idgaf if you win, Biden wins, or Mickey Mouse wins, get this shit over with
We talking Biden or Trump tho? Unless you're voting Jorgensen I've got bad news for you.
She is Biden‚Äôs biggest asset.
She‚Äôs about to checkout very soon, she‚Äôs just a little bit healthier than Biden. It‚Äôs a race for them to a very warm permanent place.
Only the unread, unlearned, casual voter who remembers Joe Biden in the same way that  the rest of us remember Andy Griffith.
That‚Äôs a whole field of bullshit. From the same idiots that expect us to believe Biden could beat anyone in a nation poll.
If  Supporters support #JoeBiden &amp; #Biden wins the election. U could get Liberals &amp; a lot of Centrist Democrats 2 support Cannabis Legalization &amp; #MedicareForAll  This All or Nothing mentality will get u Socialist no where &amp; #Trump reelected.
As much as Dems like to use this excuse every 4 years, it doesn't work.  Pick the right guy that supports the right policies and you'll see the left flock together. Picking Biden was specifically picking outside the left demographic.  Go bark up the right's tree.
With all due respect to Joe Biden, this country is well past the point where unity is possible. Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi together couldn‚Äôt do that.   The best we can hope for is to avoid another Civil War.

IF YOU VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN YOU AGREE TO LAWLESS STREETS, BURNING OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. ENJOY.
Biden should have said ‚ÄùI‚Äôm going to select the best person‚Äù.  By saying he will select a female and person of color, people will say the VP was selected because they were a black female.  This is a disservice to the many talented minority females in this country.

I do too, if I thought Bernie would be able to beat Trump I would‚Äôve voted for him because he proposes the quickest path to universal coverage. But I know that he would‚Äôve been destroyed by Trump so I voted for Biden who serves as a more round about way towards universal coverage
I‚Äôm frustrated with trump right now on some fronts personally. I‚Äôm not a trump cultist. Although I‚Äôll gladly vote for him over hidin Biden
Biden ain‚Äôt no better
He could wind up on Biden's short list for HHS Secretary
Did you expect them to approve it when the candidate who supported it lost to the one who didn‚Äôt? Like I get being annoyed but why would you be surprised, more Democrats support Biden than Bernie so obviously the party wouldn‚Äôt put M4A on the platform.
If Biden wins the Democratic Party will be gone in five years? That‚Äôs a bold prediction!

One factor in Biden‚Äôs choice for VP is someone who will be less of a target to Trump (as reported by the N.Y. Times). Are he and his old men allies clueless? ANY woman will be a target. Go for someone tough who can take the abuse and fight back.
My 82-year-old mother, a lifelong Republican, will be voting for Joe Biden. She is so disgusted at Trump‚Äôs self-serving, self aggrandizing behavior that she spits when she speaks of him. Golfing and campaigning while ppl died in nursing homes won‚Äôt win you votes.

Biden is...anti-DNC?
People said that about Biden in the primaries. Then South Carolina happened. They voted for him over two black candidates because most black voters don't vote based simply on the race of the candidate. At least, nothing in the data shows that they do.
There is no perfect candidate. She has had to work with the system she inherited. As VP she would be an excellent person to reform policing, esp with her social work background. Biden has a great final list. Would be delighted with any of them. #Biden2020
Honestly,  I don't care what letter you put in front of your name but you better hear me. You better start looking at what a Joe Biden Administration would look like. What his policies would be and whom he wants to put where. Don't lission to what he says but what he's written.

The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)

Well that should officially eliminate bass
No masks.  You only care when it benefits you.  A publicity stunt.  Vote for Biden!!!
Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
Seriously, I will be so much calmer when I never have to hear  voice ever, ever again. And I pray on inauguration day, he just takes a pass and leaves before Biden is sworn in. The less I see of him, the better.
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just saying if you tell me that in 12 years climate change is gonna to do irreparable damage and I weigh my current options....Biden has a 2 trillion dollar plan which is not enough but it better than all of trump‚Äôs deregulation‚Äôs
You used to love Bernie Sanders before Joe Biden became the nominee what happened. He wasn‚Äôt crazy Bernie before and you said Bernie was a good person and you were hoping he would be the nominee So what the hell happened?
If Biden picks her after this and the Cuban sympatico, he deserves to lose.  Holy hell.
Juan gets hat handed to him again and then starts lying AGAIN to cover. Biden and Obama left the Cunard bare. Fact. Sent too much to China. Fact. Will do not again if elected. Fact! Juan lies too much.
I don't even think Biden needs to debate - most people have already decided that they are sick of the filth that is  and his family
It's truly amazing how he is able to allocate issues during his presidency as functions of the past (Obama/Biden) and the future (Biden). I mean, truly astounding stuff.
Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre safe. They endorsed Biden. Why should democrats be concerned?

Biden also needs to execute the law so that everyone responsible for Trump's bungling is held accountable. Biden will not tread softly but he might need a big stick.
The first 100 days are significant for any president worth his mettle. Biden can't afford to be quiet his first 100 days. If he get a majority in both houses of Congress, Biden needs to work with Congress to get everything back to Obama presets, erasing all GOP damage.

conveniently forgot to mention that  condemned Trump for the immediate action he did take early on in banning travel from China. How much worse would this be under a Biden admin?
Biden wouldn't even have to climb a ladder to get to Congress like Richard Coke had to in order to get to the Texas Legislature (which met on the 2nd floor of the Capitol) after Gov. Edmund Davis refused to leave office in 1873.

President Biden and the incoming administration will have their hands full. They will seek justice for these children and their parents. No doubt about it
Perhaps Biden can send Hunter to talk to Putin and make a few million while he's at it.
Trump and the Republicans are doing, and will continue to do, countless nefarious things to lie, cheat, and steal their way to re-election. But this theory is batshit crazy talk. He's not going to rig the election to give Biden an 80-20 victory. Total insanity.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.

By gasses I tought you meant some holocaust type shit. But yeah, Biden has gassed his own citizens with tear gas. But trump has increased that exponentially aswell. Is it that hard to comprehend.
Biden saw it coming; Trump lied that it was a hoax, played golf, put Jared in charge, and 100,000 Americans are dead as a result. What more does anyone need to know? #Biden2020
Firstly by man child, I mean adults literally acting like infants. Secondly I said that he consided some of bernies progressive policies. And compared to trump, he would be the progressive candidate. And third of all I never talked about gasses.. I acknowledge that Biden
Joe Biden‚Äôs crime bill is checking you out this very instant!
This is a reminder my mum in her 80‚Äôs for the past 10 years the Texas GOP helped &amp; assisted her to get a mail in ballot &amp; contacted her for the upcoming General Election.  Good News for the 1st time ever she is voting for Biden &amp; other Dems down the ballot.
Let‚Äôs keep it going with fear.....just to get Biden elected via cheating
Ah yes republicans like trump, who have increasingly made the state more powerful and authoritarian, literally gassed his own citizens is compatible to Biden, and brain dead smuck, who has voted for bad things, but nevertheless recognizes that those decisions weren‚Äôt good ones
Oh we will.  Biden will beat u in a blowout.  There will be no doubt about the outcome....  Get ready for jail...  BTW, didn‚Äôt your Daddy go to Klan meetings??? #pospotus
‚ÄúSettle for Biden!‚Äù
You realize most of your voters are older white people right?  You screwing up your own chances!! Oops should not have told you that!!! Oh well Biden is going to kick your stupid butt no matter what!! Just keep being yourself
no he shouldnt. idk if biden should persecute him, but coumo should be able to
I‚Äôm not denying that, but like internal policies, Biden is far more better than nothing
You don‚Äôt support women....you proved that when you endorsed Biden you hypocrite...
Looks like Barry followed in the footsteps of sharpton. He took a eulogy for a representative and pissed all over it and turned his funeral into a campaign speech for joe Biden...
Ending the filibuster is crucial for progress in 2021 and beyond. Warren understood that. Now they need to get Biden et all to understand it.
Bill Cosby locked up but Trump is free and the president gotta love Amerikkka
Deleted Biden video sets off a crisis at Voice of America  via
Biden is that man that you date/screw/marry, who when you ask him to do little things to make the relationship better is like, ‚ÄúI never beat you!‚Äù Biden guys are why I‚Äôve stayed pretty single. #principled
Weird since black people disproportionally supported Biden
Can you ask #Fauci about his relationship with #BillGates Obama/Biden and the funding of the #WuhanLab that  had to stop and the creating of this bioweapon #COVID19 attack on our country for 2020 just in time for #Agenda21 to crush #US into #NWO
id feel disappointed with the senate (thank god for 2022) and elated at what biden did. dems probably cant win much more in the house, should focus morr on state house snd senate elections
I swear if it was an election between LITERAL HITLER and joe Biden, y‚Äôall would refrain from it because joe Biden is still somewhat of a bad figure
The Biden Rule: 'No Men Need Apply!'
It‚Äôs July 31,2020 and time for your daily Biden. So if you can stand in a line at a grocery store multiple times a week, why can‚Äôt you stand in line to vote? Only one reason - cheat with mail in ballots. Don‚Äôt fall for Democrats lies.
I voted for Jerry Rice. That's Biden's VP, right?
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.    When Goebbels doesn‚Äôt let the propaganda agents know the plan, everyone looks stupid. #propagandalive #VoteOutTheGOP #VoteTrumpOut2020
The reason for your idiotic tweet.  Congress will NEVER postpone the election.
Thats not it. Biden has alzheimers. Voting for Andrew Yang.
Their candidate is Joe Biden if he were more middle ground he‚Äôd be a highway median.  If this fails they will go deeper into the recesses if the left, similar to what the GOP did after McCain lost.
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Good. Gives #darkhorseduo more time. Hoping biden cracks a hip and bows out and endorses yang.
In 2007, Biden praised Obama for being a "clean" ‚Äúarticulate‚Äù black politician. He knew Obama's "divisive and mean-spirited" attitude given his community-organizer training.   He never said Obama was "ethical",
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
Sorry, Legs-up. Trump will lose in NY and California,  but he'll carry the states that actually count for true Americans who want what's best for America. And that is NOT Sleepy Joe Biden.
YES! and he should be embarrassed about giving a campaign speech during his eulogy yesterday. I don't think Trump would do this at a funeral. SO TACKY!! Get out OBAMA. We don't want you or Biden around anymore!
black people don't like the cold. That's why they live in africa. Ask sleepy joe biden.
‚ÄòAre you better off then you were 4 years ago?' Devastating new ad uses famous Reagan speech against Trump
Dem party.. Party of anti-education, anti-police and anti science..good luck with biden in November
"Barack Obama Just Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency" Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, but he has never gone as far as Obama did Thursday.  (So, now we know who the puppeteer is of Joe Biden! Tough debates Joe!)
I have a Campaign Slogan. It goes ....‚Äú The Better Man Calling The Kettle Black, Build Better Pot Back ‚Äú . You know The Thing !  #Trump2020 #Biden2020 #Biden    #Election2020 #Potus #POTUS45 #BLM #Protest #protests2020 #kanye2020 #KanyeWest
It‚Äôs funny.  Both Obama and Biden claim to have all the answers to our problems, but they FAILED during their 8 years.  In Biden‚Äôs case he‚Äôs been working on the same stuff for over 40 years= nothing!! What the hell has Biden been doing for 40 years???
I would not care if the caught Biden in a hotel room with a bag of cocaine a hooker and a pirate I'm still voting for him!!!
If Biden wins the Russians did it.
It‚Äôs not a stutter.  It‚Äôs the inability to articulate sentences, forgetting where he is, who he is and what he‚Äôs running for.  I wouldn‚Äôt criticize someone for a stutter.  I have a friend who has one.  What Biden does is not a stutter.  Watch this:
An American Patriot holding the hill! Coach, fear not, American Patriots are by your side on that hill!
As a reporter, the first question I'd ask Biden is to describe his cognitive test. Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV.
Biden spoke for organization founded and led by Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas operatives
No we aren‚Äôt. Many people are dreading the beautiful United States sliding into a toilet of left wing politically correct totalitarianism, where mass illegal immigration is encouraged,and the liberty of the individual is crushed by the State. Biden is a disaster waiting to happen
Trump Escalates His Election Doubts With Biden Lead Widening
Obama wants a third term so badly if Biden is elected Obama will be the puppet master. #Trump2020 #AmericaFirst #Freedom #MAGA
Remember when Biden said this?
Please remember when Biden said this
Biden is being groomed to allow an otherwise national political failure Kamala Harris to slide into the Presidency.  Crackpot you say? Hardly.
Trump isn't guilty of anything. Joe Biden is involved so is Obama.
Except they're using the same message against Biden they would against Bernie.
Obama is campaigning for his third term he will be running the country if Biden is elected.  #Trump2020 #Freedom #MAGA
He *is* hiding in his basement, though. Probably for the best, I'd rather Biden wins, tbh.
Lmao. Who would have known this movie predicted Biden's speeches from his basement.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Nunes has opposition research that he will give to Barr who will use that information to conduct surveillance on the Biden campaign. No biggie.
Biden Campaign is getting odd advice from anonymous sources to pour most of its campaign $$$ into Montana and Wyoming.  The advice is in Russian which should raise suspicions right there.
"U.K. Officials‚Äô New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by Mark Landler via NYT
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. All the people on the list would be fantastic as the VP. Just pick one of them and get this show on the road.  That's it. That's the Tweet.
We now know that Biden was prescient, accessing information about things before they happened.
So writing a crime bill targeting blacks isn‚Äôt immoral to you? Being unable to complete an entire sentence isn‚Äôt incompetence to you? Grabbing a female aid isn‚Äôt indecent to you? Biden did all those things, but nothing to help this nation in the 40+ years he held public office.
DIScouraging that this is needed...ENcouraging the people are thinking about it and taking action. ‚úùÔ∏è‚úåüíõüá∫üá∏  "A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty."
tomorrow in the U.S, around 220,000 muslims will spend Eid in prison. that is about one-tenth of the people incarcerated inside of thousands of U.S. state and federal facilities in large part because of joe biden
To bad he won't be around to see it.  The votes will be tallied on electon night and only states that are too close to call may run over a day or two. When Biden wins he will be removed from office on January 20, 2021. His lawsuit won't do him any good.
I have no problem criticizing Biden myself. Personally, I think the Burisma stuff is a legit problem. Well, it *would* be if it hadn‚Äôt been for the ‚Äúperfect call.‚Äù Trump nulllifed the issue for Uncle Joe. POTUS is his own worst enemy.
I say pass a law. Call their bluff. Call it the Hunter Biden is corrupt Act for all I care. They won‚Äôt do it because the legislators themselves don‚Äôt want that gravy train to end.
Sounds like you're describing Democrats like Biden an Obama
Oh I know. üò¢üíî
Lol Never going to happen ,Hillary couldn't beat him lol you think Biden the pervert an Kamala the blow job queen can?? Lol lol a feeler an a kneeler .lol
But that‚Äôs under the Trump administration. Lindsey is a chameleon and has no problems with contradicting himself when the environment changes. He will probably get chummy with Biden again once Trump is out of the picture.
I would love that!!! But I feel for Joe Biden. This is a bigger mess than GWB left.
It‚Äôs just a little opposition research. Nothing to worry about. I‚Äôm sure it will be enough evidence for Barr to run surveillance on the Biden campaign.
Biden wasn‚Äôt our first choice, but that‚Äôs the card we got dealt.  Idk why people who are most likely going to vote Democrat in November still spend time bashing him.
Tweeting like this is irresponsible.   You‚Äôre either voting for Trump or Biden. There‚Äôs no in between and there‚Äôs no 3rd party.
Biden slander means you fw trump

HRC NEVER accepted the election results &amp; when shit got real, she got with Obama, Biden, Holder Lynch, Comey &amp; started breaking laws hoisting anything they could  I gotta tell ya I wasnt on the trump train in 2016 I wanted Cruz to win but now I'm glad we got him.
I‚Äôve got a lil‚Äô bit of a ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù candidate for Biden‚Äôs VP: a fella from St. Louis that some people know as ‚ÄúKen Bone.‚Äù
It‚Äôs opposition research, completely legal.   I‚Äôm sure this information will allow Barr to conduct surveillance on the Biden campaign in a completely ‚ÄúBy the Book‚Äù (as Susan Rice so eloquently put it) investigation into corruption.
"Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report" | Fox News  [ Huh ?   What's this about ?   She wants Biden's endorsement first &amp; he hasn't even called her ?]
Bernie bros say Biden is ‚ÄúRepublican lite.‚Äù The term ‚Äúleftist‚Äù isn‚Äôt sticking to him, in part because he was attacked from the left for the whole of the primary season.
Filibuster is a Jim Crow relic, yet Biden is the relic. Biden in the 1970s fought against bussing and integrating schools in Delaware
The fact that people actually think this way, unless they are already very wealthy and unimpacted, is insane.  Biden is the clear front runner. If there was ever a time to take the corporate donors to task, this is it.
Describe Joe Biden in 3 Words.
Biden is not sound at all
Biden is. The science is settled.
Biden is anti science.
Campaign 2020 You can see what a good job Obama &amp; Biden did raising up minority communities in cities like Chicago and St. Louis
If you are a Muslim and you support Biden or Trump you should be ashamed of yourself these people are puppets of Zionist of Dajjal
You think Biden is the sane one? Well, you‚Äôre in for a surprise.
Oh, a Biden administration will make them even worse. They would MUCH rather lose to Republicans than lose to popular, more centrist Democrats.
Says your PR people...whatever Biden camp....keep dreaming
Yes. Indeed. If only Biden could speak well.
‚ÄúSteve Guest, the director of rapid response for the Republican National Committee, responded, ‚ÄúJoe Biden is off his rocker to make such an irresponsible allegation without any evidence.‚Äù Well, now we have the evidence.‚Äù
The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Some of y‚Äôall never Biden types were making fun of Angela Davis and other revolutionary political figures who support Biden, calling them ‚Äúshitlibs‚Äù. Since you‚Äôre one of them, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me you Jork such views. But genuenly tell me, why not Biden???
She's always talking about how smart Joe Biden is.
I think I‚Äôll feel a LOT safer in President Biden‚Äôs America than I have in the past 3 and a half years under Pretendident Trump‚Äôs cruel and incompetent
Ann, you‚Äôre probably sad about this.  Your attacks on Trump will only help Biden win.  Shame on you.  You‚Äôre like a little baby who didn‚Äôt get your way
But will you remember you‚Äôre the President?  Or you know, vote for that other Biden
Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it‚Äôs worst than the other. There will never be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù politician. Bernie wasn‚Äôt either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process
I genuenly question sometimes wether y‚Äôall bitches have any working neurons. Y‚Äôall made fun of Angela Davis, a communist who has faced oppression and opposition from all sides of the political scale, for supporting Biden. As if any of y‚Äôall who recently got into leftist...
What other option do you have my guy, Donald has made this country Into an increasingly militaristic state, threatening the lives of minorities (lgbt, black and Latinos). But you‚Äôre out here complaining because ‚Äúmuhh Biden bad.‚Äù
Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.
Yes I will vote Biden this November
How did America forget Trump asked China for Biden investigation! Trump Publicly Urges China to Investigate the Bidens
If you think Biden has some kind of independent power over his party, that's news to no one.
My life is not dictates who the president is. It‚Äôs dictated by what he does. Trump is fighting for me. Biden will not.
I see accusations without facts or proof. These canned propaganda stories have been debunked and debunked again. The onion will be peeled back on the dems and we'll talk about corruption. Biden is DEFINITELY not competent. That obvious racist's mind is gone.
Each state would get 1 vote, but let's assume D gov picks all D and R gov all R. Current count is 24 = D &amp; 26 =R. I count at least 2 R govs that would throw Trump aside: Ohio and Vermont. Biden is President. Your thoughts? (3) End
If Donald Trump was the alarm for this country, Joe Biden is the snooze button
So if you agree, can we count on your vote to keep the USA great? Biden led by socialist Bernie and his squad will turn the USA into Venezuela, a great nation destroyed. Please help save our USA from socialism! XOXOXOXO
Impeach him a million times democrats we don't give a fuck... He will serve 8 yrs &amp; you will cry... If you want control of the WH then run someone better than Hillary or Pedo Joe Biden
Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
I know, she's a trooper but we've got to get Biden in. After that, work on purging some of Moscow Mitch's worst appointees.

No one knows.  It‚Äôs time for Biden‚Äôs nap!! Ssssh!
Guess you think more of Trump and less of Biden  than I do to let His VP pick determine who‚Äôs you‚Äôll vote for POTUS.  If his pick is an empty. An of beer I am voting for Joe
Donald Trump = Herbert Hoover Joe Biden = Franklin D. Roosevelt
Well I see he‚Äôs done more than most Republicans who just say they will do something. I can‚Äôt support Biden who is a member of my Church and is in open rebellion against what the church teaches.
And hes not voting for Biden, he just ‚Äúdoesnt know‚Äù now if he will vote for trump!!! Who doesnt know yet??? WHO?
150,283 deaths of covid and counting. Does the number 32.9% mean anything to you? Riding with Biden 2020 Y‚Äôall are going to lose big, that very clear.

Sounds like the campaign is to now slander Biden as much as possible
Trump 2020, With Biden an Kamala you get a feeler  an one kneeler lol
Hey Biden! It‚Äôs going to be a cold day in hell!
UK hadn‚Äôt changed as well. Although it doesn‚Äôt have gut to say no to America, Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Keep on pushing.  There are people who see through you pushing this story.  Trump wins handily, but wait we have these uncounted votes that magically lean 99% Joe Biden, all in one truck.
Devin Nunes can show video of Biden eating babies for all I care. It‚Äôs not going to stop me from voting for Biden.
Unbelievable stuff in America today.   Biden must not ever win.
I‚Äôve finally decided I‚Äôm going to vote for Joe Biden instead of not voting because I want to see a president die in office it‚Äôs just a guaranteed major historical event I can‚Äôt pass up
If you are a republican voting for Biden is slitting your own throat. The current generation of Dems cannot be allowed control of D.C. or they will forever change the way our elections are run and lock out Republicans for at least a generation.
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
Wednesday morning, Nov. 4th:   Biden‚Äôs team had better bring their lightsabers.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.
OMG! It‚Äôs code for vote Biden.
What?  lied again? I‚Äôm shocked!! (Sarcasm) Obama used a funeral as a campaign stage for Biden!  if you were not able to have a funeral for a loved one, remember this moment. The only people who matter to Obama/Biden are the ones with power !  Imagine if Trump did that
Problem is Biden wont pardon him and if he quits now, Pence might pardon him but whose going to pardon Pence

...Biden worried that desegregation policies in '77 would cause his children to grow up'in a racial jungle'. In later events of 2007, Biden attributed Iowa‚Äôs educational successes to its lack of minorities in the state then he praised Obama for being a "clean" ‚Äù black politician.
Joe Biden has a history of making racially-charged remarks, having opposed desegregation busing in the 1970's, claiming it codifies that a black is inferior to a white. In '75, Joe said segregation was a matter of 'black pride'. ...
I like the way that  sums it up by saying that  clearly a cult
Stop gaslighting us into thinking that Biden is the savior. His politics gave us Trump.
I'm glad Joe Biden has told You What Color You are and how to vote.
Is this supposed to dissuade people from voting for Mr Biden?
45 is a pathological liar!! 45 did nothing about the virus for months and everyone knows it! 45 is responsible for more than 151,000 dead Americans. Everyone‚Äôs voting for Joe Biden in 96 days üåäüåäüåäüåä#TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsARacist

Yes. He does. When Joe Biden wins in November. It will be great.
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Biden was glad to assist Barry-O, bored floating along in Congress. ‚ÄúYou got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy."  Lewis, Jackson, Clyburn, Sharpton, Waters must have pushed to get in line behind somnambulant Joey.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt want Biden either, yuck.

Good to know Joe Biden‚Äôs assistant.
Right!! You got two choices, Joe Biden or the Orange fuck Trump. We know what Biden is about and we dying seeing what Trump is about. I choose to live and have a brighter day. I‚Äôm voting for Biden.

A vote for Biden is a vote for China.

#BarakObamaIsARacist   I say we start rioting unti they unseal Hussein‚Äôs records!   America has had enough of this BS!! Obama/Biden  got us here, #Trump is our ONLY way out!   How did Obama come into politics as a poor coke head and leave a multi-millionaire?  #SilentNoMore
You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Hey all...let's all say we're voting for him. Let's lie to pollsters.  And when the nov results come in, (hopefully with a HUGE Biden landslide)  he can't say " it's close! Its a hoax, or its rigged".
Let's see ... the neoliberal center-left political philosophy of Clinton-Obama-Clinton (and Biden) lifted billions out of poverty and extended the reach of liberal democratic institutions well into central, and even eastern, Europe.    Now we can't even go to Canada.
That‚Äôs right Mr Biden, now finish your pudding.
Beautiful little girl. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs missed dearly. We will get Biden in and get some sensible gun control, but we need to flip SENATE as well. So everyone please VOTE!!
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
Ya think they're not everywhere thanks to Obama/Biden?
Lies lies lies. democrats always LIE. Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue. The debates probably won‚Äôt happen the poor man couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day.
Your attacks on Biden are terrible!  You realize you work for the most disliked person in the world.  I bet Kim Jong Un is liked by more people than #DamagedDonnie.  He‚Äôs an embarrassment and the worst POTUS I‚Äôll see in my lifetime.
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
He‚Äôs Protecting us from vile left wing radicals burning destroying &amp; looting. Plus I don‚Äôt want a pervert in the White House we had one before in Bill boy Clinton he‚Äôs the one who flew on Epstein‚Äôs plane 50 times. Biden can‚Äôt keep his hands off any little girl he‚Äôs disgusting.
You only like Biden because you know he will run the country like Bush 43.
Stick to ... whatever the fuck it is you do. If Biden was president, the virus would be far more under control and the chances of a FULL college football season would be greater. You really are a stupid b*tch.
I disagree, I think Biden is 100% senile...the guys lost his cognitive thought process.
This graphic implies that 270 gets reached at FL. But, by my math, if Biden wins PA &amp; WI and everything to the left of them, he's at 274, even without FL + NH. What am I missing?
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
Biden is the one who will quit. Probably before the debates. He couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day. By the time of the debates the man won‚Äôt know his face from his ass. Thanks dumbocrats for giving us a man with Dementia and early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  MAGAMAGAMAGA
If liberals believed in this I would support Biden
You‚Äôre right, IF that craziness ever happens, we know the same team writing your tweets for you now, will continue to do this for you.   More taxpayer money wasted on the great joe Biden. üôÑ
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  üò¥
It's not what Biden said or says. Just tell us what you say. We do support lawful policing. We do not support militarization of police forces. We do not support federalization of policing. We do support prosecution of those who loot, vandalize and are violent. Any questions?
OMG, he doesn't know what planet he's on, let alone what state he's in. Electing Joe Biden is basically electing the VP to the highest office in the land. And my guess is they're teeing up Michelle or Barack HIMSELF!!
Just know Biden won.
Thats how politicians funnel $$$$.... Look how Joe Biden got his son millions
Joe Biden: please nominate Barack Obama as your running Vice President!
That was back when Biden could string a few coherent words together. Still got it wrong.
To me, this says Biden is behind by 10 points in NH and we all have to work even harder now.
I will tell you the results now.  #Biden wins.  You are out!
And it's a blessing - an unmitigated blessing - that he  didn't attend. The funeral made clear, as Biden makes clear every time he speaks, we do not have a president. The presidency is occupied by a malignancy.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.
He should have said that he is voting for  I mean what the hell is he waiting for?
Couple that with this turtle walk on #SPYGATE indictments... you can bet if Biden wins, ALL documents/files will be long gone n case closed.
Sorry but I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Trump is a laughing Stock üòÇüòÇ.
this woman is so desperate.  All of the DEMORat Party is in panic mode because they have been CAUGHT. CAUGHT IN YEARS AND YEARS OF LIE'S, CORRUPTION, STEALING FROM THE PEOPLE, CAUGHT IN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT including PEDOPHILIA,. OBAMA n BIDEN  have been CAUGHT in Ukraine
I've never met a Conservative for Joe Biden. Millions huh?
‚ÄúLike, this is easy,‚Äù George Clooney said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two candidates here. One claims that our first Black president wasn‚Äôt a citizen, and the other was his vice president.‚Äù
Biden is getting 92 percent black support. Trump only getting 8 percent in 2020 yeah your so right Trump has done such a great job with Blacks üòÇüòÇ. Let‚Äôs delay the elections. The only man who says dumb stuff like that is when they know they will lose badly.
üìå¬†Biden‚Äôs Anti-Woman Plan:
I voted for her in the primaries. now it looks like the best we might be able to hope for is that she becomes Biden's vice president and is in charge via de facto information-filtering through a man who was nowhere near as qualified.  You know, Peak America.
Bullshit. You‚Äôre just making things up. Biden was the overwhelming winner of the primary and there are almost no instances of meaningful mail in voter fraud this year.
Yes Biden is bigly
Then I hope you aren't voting for Biden.
YES!!!  's guest this week thought she would be an excellent VP also, because Biden will need a vice president who can step into the presidency on zero notice. And Elizabeth Warren is ready to be president right now.
It's safe to say Biden's VP will not be trashed by the press in the same way Mike Pence was in 2016.
Ever think it's a tacticle move.Hes not stupid ..This is a 4D chess master move .BIDEN NEEDS TO COME TO DEBATE
I‚Äôll be voting for Biden
Not going to lie. I‚Äôve never seen someone in my 52 years that I want to see lose as much as Trump. I hope it‚Äôs a biblical ass whipping. Is Joe Biden my choice? Nope. But Trump needs to go down in a historical manner to shut his ignorant fat mouth.
Biden doesn't know wether to scratch his watch or wind his ass
You know people are excited about voting when there‚Äôs literally a movement called ‚ÄúSettle For Biden.‚Äù

"I have a great idea!  Let's run against both Jie Biden and Barack Obama in 2020", said no Republican strategist ever.
..yet on the other hand, Biden is SUPER boring. I think between Biden's lack of charisma, Trump looking weak, and COVID, this is going to be a record low turnout, and it's going to come down to which side is less interested.   Force me to answer, and I'd give the edge to Biden.
He‚Äôs a few minutes away from saying Biden should be thrown in jail and he should run unopposed. This is Mugabe/Putin/etc bulls***
Secret Service dragging his ass out of the White House after Biden is sworn in is fine with me.
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid

Joe Biden will cut your taxes. Trump will cut the taxes of the rich people so they‚Äôll get even richer. üí£üéä
I agree with you. The 2 party system isn‚Äôt working anymore. Both are corrupt and ineffective. But, this is not the election to make that point. Right now, it is either or... you are wasting your vote if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. America can‚Äôt endure 4 more years of Trump!

thank you, McD!  I appreciate your support.  ‚úåüèº
If Trump got removed, and Pence took over, Biden would lose the election easy. Not that this would ever happen, but for sure factual.
Hillary was, and yeah it's an opinion, just because it's an opinion doesn't completely negate it. I believe Biden is smarter because at least he listens to statistics and science and all that.
Fuck Trump and Biden........and what ?!

Joe Biden is quite possibly the worst candidate to ever run or president. Mentally broken and morally corrupt...who agrees?
Well, Biden has a plan to create climate jobs during a time we will need jobs, tackling two issues at once.  Pretty smart idea IMO and a way to make tackling climate change less partisan...  See, there you go!

I got it from DeBlasio, Pelosi who took it so seriously that they lobbied to keep their China towns open.  I took it from Joe Biden, who called Trump a racist for shutting China travel down.   I took it from Adam Scuff, who dragged the Administration in a wasted impeachment scam.
No China will be and all the lying liberals all over the news on CNN, ABC &amp; MSNBC that downplayed it, telling us not to worry, that we have recorded on video before the Spring , plus Biden making fun of POTUS‚Äô early travel ban, along with the evil W.H.O. that told us it was NBD!

I believe any FOIA request can attain the document. I'm quite certain it is real [it exists]. The question is did JFK Jr send it or did someone acting as him? (which would be an odd thing to fake, to pose as JFK Jr and send a letter to Biden accusing him of being a traitor)
when did james woods become such a deuce ? I remember watching him in early 2000s he was such a nice guy. idc bout his politics but he never seem to have anything nice to say bout anyone. but point taken . democrats could ve chosen someone better than biden
Gross that this divisive manipulative ex-prez used a funeral this. Especially when Joe Biden can‚Äôt speak for himself.
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
When he loses on November 3, I think the scariest time in our history will be the days after the election until  January 20, 2021 when President Biden is sworn in! Gut check time for ALL, White, Black, man, woman, republican, Democratic to make sure we survive this madman.
Biden is on some kind of secret happy drug or something.  This is there guy?  Really?
I thought the Biden fundraising texts and e-mails were pushy.  The Trump ones are just downright rude and abusive!
No we do not need to change the election date. Biden may or may not be the answer but Trump is definitely not the answer.
Trump is terrified and can't figure a way out  Constitutionally impossible': Experts say Trump can't postpone the November election The president, trailing Joe Biden in the polls, teased delaying the election over fears of the kind of voter fraud that does not exist.
What was he doing when he was president besides making memes with Biden??? He had all the power back then to do this why didn‚Äôt he then?
Depends on if she swallowed when she....Well, You know. Biden doesnt like evidence left on his clothing.
No but u can get a fuck Biden
The media and the Democrats as a whole completely underestimated Biden and his popularity.
Even Biden doesn‚Äôt believe you.
No, Biden‚Äôs election won't end the nightmare by
Culture will be front and center for Biden and the Dems. Republicans need to respond strongly and confidently.
Your ignorance shows. I was watching the news before spring when all the liberal media were totally downplaying Covid along with evil W.H.O. Biden was criticizing Trump for his early travel ban!! Anderson Cooper saying the seasonal flu is worse. Democrats are all liars
She‚Äôs my choice too. If not, maybe Biden should appoint EW to a Jared-like position so that she can run everything. Then for VP: Rice, Michelle, Jarrett, Duckworth, Bass, or Abrams.

is amazing and I hope she has a large role somewhere in the Biden administration!!
Isn't Biden horrid....
I agree with everything you just said except, for me, replace Warren w/Beto.  I have been arguing this point the minute Biden won SC  Outside of cable media &amp; woke Twitter most people do not care if Biden picks Harley Quinn.  Most just want that Apocalyptic Apricot AntiChrist out
Biden looks like Mr. Magoo.  üòÇ
People who think Biden won‚Äôt use secret police make me laugh because Obama was the one who signed that power to the president   Both sides of the same coin

Blue woman is there to protect Biden
I thought Biden was at the Lewis funeral .  What happened?    #BidenInTheBasement
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
For 15 times or more President Obama stood to eulogize or speak Senator John McCain,Senator Ted Kennedy, State SenatorClementa Pinckney, Beau Biden, Sandy Hook, Senators Inouye, Byrd, Nelson Mandela and now Rep.John Lewis. He keeps standing for America to be whole #GoodTrouble
You know you‚Äôre going to lose.   #DumpTrump #Biden #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Biden can‚Äôt remember his first name
The choices appear to be Trump or Biden. Biden can't string two sentences together on a good day. He's not a choice at all.
I can‚Äôt trust this socialist democrat ideology either.  Biden just seems dangerous.  Not him personally but he would easily had the wheel over to whomever.   Trumps a clown, no doubt.. but I‚Äôll vote for his 4 lame duck years over Biden
Yeah, remember when they accused Trump of using a church and bible as a political photo-op ?  Hijacking a funeral to give a political speech because Obama knows Biden can't put two words together appears to be ok though.
I‚Äôm attending Joe Biden for President‚Äôs event, ‚ÄúDallas Phone Bank for Biden!‚Äù ‚Äì sign up now to join me! #TeamJoe
It was the best campaign speech for Joe Biden yet.
Can Biden choose Barack as his VP?
President Obama gave a most eloquent eulogy for John Lewis. So uplifting and unifying. Just as President Biden will do, beginning 1/20/2021  12:01 pm. Americans are tired of your hate and division. We‚Äôre voting you out 11/3, legal Election Day.
I‚Äôm super happy to see this post on my Facebook page. Everybody knows how I feel about Elizabeth Warren‚Ä¶ I will vote blue no matter who. The selection of women Biden has to choose from is stellar!
The Twitter hack exposed fact that employees had COMPLETE control of "verified" accounts.    Did Twitter employees use "internal systems and tools" to pose as verified account holders?
So Obama basically hijacked a man's funeral today to do Biden's job.   Sick.
Absolutely, I‚Äôm a Republican, leaving the party to vote for Biden to save this country. #WeWillVote.

My heart is swelling, eyes watering. Just donated to the Biden campaign and figuring what other steps I can do right now to help with the election!
I think the inelasticity in Florida has been due to the high number of retirees. And that cohort is uncharacteristically Biden leaning in the crosstabs, these days.
Isn‚Äôt it majority of electors voting in Dec. if red states don‚Äôt vote, then the number for majority goes down to say 190 Instead of 270. Blue states give Biden 190.
I can‚Äôt wait to vote for Joe Biden, in Texas, in Collin County. üá∫üá∏üíô #WeWillVote  #Biden2020  #FlipTexasBlue
Anti-racist? Benevolence? Ability to speak in coherent sentences? You obviously haven't researched Biden.  You literally only listed two things that are verifiable.
The fact that Obama had to go that level of deception (at a funeral no less) tells you that the left has no confidence in Biden and are willing to do whatever they can to gain power.  It's all about power.   What little respect I had left for this man died today.
Which means if President Obama goes in like this during a eulogy, just imagine how his campaign speeches for Joe Biden are going to be this fall.
One scenario (bad) tRump totally steamrolls Biden at all 3 debates. And mean totally blows him out of the water. I hope it doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt see it happening but it could. Joe can get bigged down in #‚Äôs and 3 part plans and gets confusing at time, especially when ahole interrupts
...because ol joe Biden speaks in complete sentences when?
Biden has betrayed his moderate backers by embracing Sanders‚Äôs spending and Warren‚Äôs antibusiness bent, writes Phil Gramm
Delay the November election and have it take place on Christmas Day. Trump and Biden have to deliver gifts to the children of America and the children will vote based on how good the gifts were. This is the way America will run from now on.
Surely No One possibly believes that Biden would be the Real President if elected. Maybe Clinton, Obama, Someone, but not him. Was never the plot.
I encourage you to research Biden and come back for correction.
Most hardcore Biden supporters sound no different that Magats and their anti-mask crusade. Same energy.
We can go round and round but Biden is a republican, and he has said so himself recently. Unless there are major changes to his platform (lol) my presidential vote will be green.   $10 a hour lmao kiss my ass dude.
Lol what does Biden bring to office that Trump can't? Have you seen Biden's resume as a career politician? It's glaringly bad.
Uh. Trump just admitted he likes the idea of Kamala Harris as Biden's running mate. That would mean we agree on something. I may have to reconsider my opinion of her now.
What is wrong with people... of course Biden isn‚Äôt going to pick keisha lance bottoms... the ticket can‚Äôt say   Biden Bottoms 2020 üòÇ... it just can‚Äôt
agreed...100 pero, gotta admit, tambien biden no esta terminando sus frases, making me doubt him sometimes whether hes all there.
Its literally the same thing, he's going to leave legalization up to the states (AT THE BEST) and the feds will still knock down people's doors for dime bags.  Biden couldn't push his ol bud obama to increase the min wage one time in 8 years, but I am suppose to believe him now
And yet  attended a mask-less Trump rally in Texas yesterday and egged on the Cheeto Puff in slandering Biden.
I can recall 8 years of having a sham president and a con VP in the Obama/Biden circus.
if biden keeps hiding in his basement and they don‚Äôt ever debate yeah it‚Äôs gonna be really bad
Ppl will hate you for this but tell you to vote just to get trump out, like biden aint the same snack on the other end. Smh. Do what you gotta do for you
The lack of intellectual honest is shocking.  Even Fox says "And, Congress often fell short of appropriating the full amount of COPS funding requested by the Obama administration."  Joe Biden didn't do anything - Congress did.  You are better than this Hogan - do better

Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Obamacare comes from the heritage foundation so by definition, yes it is republican.   Biden supports fracking. Republican idea.   $15 min wage was 10 years ago dude lmao.  Biden is against pot decriminalization which is a republican talking point.
The absolute best campaign speech for Joe Biden yet! The entire message by Obama was "we need to CHANGE the country!" The bow on top was John Lewis.
Believe it or not, but our military takes ethics and their oath to defend the constitution very seriously. If Trump tries this strategy, the US military will begin taking orders from Joe Biden. Then the GOP won't back Trump.
Tomi please Trump said the virus is a hoax  . Trump waited to long to to something about it . And the real ass kicker is he tries to make Fauci the scapegoat for his ignorance ,I‚Äôm sorry but get your complaints ready for Biden .thats my final thought
What if this was CLASSIFIED information?
Joe Biden is totally incapable of being POTUS!
Latinx voters in TX will turn the tide with MJ, Biden, Salter, and all other patriotic candidates flooded into office.
Biden correctly predicted the totalitarian instincts of Trump. Trump is dabbling in destroying the US. This isn‚Äôt a time for ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù
Well, as they say "it takes two to tango." So, a lot will depend on how Biden engages the hemisphere. The challenges will be significant &amp; unless regional leaders have a better option, just out of self-interest, they will seek accommodation w/ the new administration.
Biden supports huge parts of the Green New Deal, "shifting" funding away from police, confiscating "assault rifles". He won't denounce BLM, every Dem POTUS candidate supported free health care for illegals.   The radicals are running the asylum while their leader is senile
If Bernie were the candidate, you might be right, but Biden is not a threat to military funding or expansion, so I have a hard time seeing how they would follow an unconstitutional order to help Trump stay in power. He has burned much of his political capital in military circles.
Not going to happen orange felon!!! Nov 3rd America and Joe Biden are going to take out the trash!!
Amazing how you haven't been forgotten yet. No one talks about Hunter Biden cuz that political move on y'all's part was a non starter."but her emails!" Give it a rest.
If I am found at 92 with dementia naked alongside a mid 35's female in shape please mark my vote for Biden because I seek to push for dementia rights.
Not entirely sure having "natural" allies is necessary, but people like Duque, Cortizo, Moreno, Fernandez, Lacalle, Abinader, Pi√±era, will find working with Biden quite "natural"...&amp; Hernandez, Bukele, even AMLO, will accommodate themselves w/ new reality.
Dementia is a terrible terrible disease and I feel bad for anyone who has it and their family BUT people are crazy if they think Biden doesn‚Äôt have some sort of memory problem. #biden
if libertarians were forced to choose at gun point I would assume zero would vote for Biden, so realistically it‚Äôs probably helping him. IF a vote was mandatory. If not, it doesn‚Äôt matter at all lol

Trump is a grinder.  Biden is not.  (Nor was Mrs Clinton).  This election will be very close...again.
Yeah... well no worries! She will get rid of Biden soon and bring in Killery as her mate! She can‚Äôt be arrested then. And if she doesn‚Äôt.. then she will commit ‚Äúsuicide ‚Äú or have a horrible accident!  Watch! That‚Äôs my guess!
Just can't wait for the reaction of Trump and the GOP when the same night voting results are showing a slight Trump lead and then 3 days later it's a Biden landslide. I'm sure they will accept that no problem.
Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.
Media is pushing him because someone has to replace Biden by Nov. and their barn is empty
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.

I can't tell you how many times I stopped myself from sharing a positive post or policy announcement from Biden because of how the consensus has been to be pessimistic about his candidacy.  Not anymore. I'm enthusiastically voting for him. Cause these 4 years of shit has to stop.
Yeah, Trump would never do that. Crazy Biden!
I have wondered the same thing for years.  If my husband was handling and sniffing little girls like Biden has always done, I would get him some serious help.  Poor old fellow.
I point this out to tell you: I ask you to genuinely look at all of this combined with all from the last four years &amp; honestly tell me that Joe Biden would be just as bad or worse.  If you say yes, you are either genuinely lying to yourself or worse.

I'm still highly doubtful.  First, Biden has to campaign some, that's just reality.  Second, the Covid/racial strife/Covid cycle is likely coming to an end sooner rather than later, and some Trump leaners will be back in the fold.
Even Andrew who always votes red said we just need Biden in office to stop the divide and move forward. Republicans can pick up their pieces after Bidens four years but trump is toxic.

You really are doing and saying everything you possibly can to lose the election to Joe Biden. That is going to be as bad as  losing to Obama. Republicans are the gift that keeps on giving to pathetic loser Dems.
That WaPo article can be found here:
During a speech last night Basement_Biden AGAIN misspoke about where he was &amp; then with a nervous laugh said it was a joke.
Joe Biden. Experience!!!
Trump continues to try to tap into the ‚Äúfears and anger and resentment of people...and redirect in nativist, racist, sexist ways.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a fake poll.  nobody‚Äôs gonna vote for Biden.  he doesn‚Äôt even know what country he‚Äôs running for president in
Biden Selects Aunt Jemima As Running Mate
How stupid are you!! Obama had kids in cages and if he is replacing a old fence with a new  wall then yes dumbass he built it!! Now go down to your Biden basement and meditate because he'll need all the help he can from TRUMP routing his ass in November! üò≠üò≠üò≠

Hiden Biden would sell his soul to the devil if it guaranteed him victory on 11-3
Poor old sleepy creepy Joe Biden. Wonder which Democrat told him to say that one. He is too ignorant to even come up with that stupidity
To be fair I watched an incoherent Biden speech also. So things are going great.
Not.  Happening.  Joe Biden sounds lost and confused.
Watching Biden answer scripted questions with the media that has been handpicked is not answering the media‚Äôs questions.
No telling what Harris would work on in the background to continue the police state.   I do think the powers that be/bureaucrats prefer Biden because like you said he'd just let the system continue it's current direction.  I think our real change will have to come from the bottom
Why do folks think Biden will fix the police state or racial injustice?  That fool has been in politics for his whole live and has helped build those systems.  There is no winning choice for president in 2020.  I said winning not third party üòÖ
Come on Tom, Biden would do something very similar, quit lying to us. Biden is not a leader, he's a sycophant for large $$ donors. Taxes do NOT fund federal spending. They never have. Did you not question in grade school how FDR funded the New Deal when the economy had crashed?
Joe Biden is NOT advocating for #M4A, therefore Joe Biden is NOT a leader -- wake up Tom!!  Be an American!!
Boat parade in Hot Springs Arkansas also drew hundreds of boats yesterday. Not a Biden flag to be seen.
If it doesn‚Äôt go down, Biden will be deemed to chicken shit to debate Trump.  If it does go down....well it won‚Äôt be pretty for Joe.
Pelosi's destructive policies are non-essential.  I think her pandering angers me even more than that of Biden.  Forget Trump, we need Ds that FIGHT for us, not empower the enemy.
There you go again listening to FAKE NEWS CNN! They've got you brain suckered as usual.Biden won't do it because he can't get 2 lines without screwing it up! Good ol dementia Joe!
Pepsi was dancing n the streets of SF  that time and both her and Biden said we should not shut down travel to China - save your lying message for someone else.
Biden saves lives  Might save all our lives
So the answer is to elect Biden? So we can give our jobs back to Mexico and China? So he can raise our taxes to pay for free everything? You ppls blind hate for Trump is going to put Biden in officeband your personal finances in hell.
Biden takes corporate money why would he need ours? what is it going to buy us? When he has told them nothing is going to fundamentally change, asking us for money is VULTURISM!!!

I wonder if Joe Biden can repeat 5 things twice in 5 minutes....all signs point to NoIt doesn't matter who the Democratic Candidate is they will always find something to bitch about.

Sorry Deb. Trump wasn‚Äôt involved. He‚Äôs still your President. Will be. Oh BTW, BIDEN owns the island right next to EPSTEIN‚ÄôS PEDO island...Guess what will be coming up next???
The island right next to Epstein‚Äôs pedo island is owned by Biden. Grand sniffin‚Äô party days!
‚ÄúBut Biden doesn‚Äôt need a Black VP, he‚Äôs already got the Black vote.‚Äù As if Black people exist only for political purposes?? -_-
You do know Biden is seriously sick right? He doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
Fox News mocked Biden for suggesting that Trump might try to delay the election. Then Trump suggested...delaying the election.
My totally Novice Q is, Since Biden is being briefed on ‚Äúthings‚Äù would he or would he not be obtaining briefs on such materials especially since it includes a questionable at best member of Intel Commity? And involvement in impeachment hearing clown show??
He wasn‚Äôt involved. I know you lefties are hoping n wishing, but the reality is Trump is the one trying to stop sex trafficking, not Obama, and certainly not the Clintons. Biden OWNS the island 10 miles away from Epstein. Ghislane owns submarines. It‚Äôs coming out soon...
It is apparent after that divisive speech, who will be pulling Biden's puppet strings.  Praying for the Durham Report.  d
Obama will be pulling Biden's puppet strings if Biden wins.       Obama will be the real mouthpiece.
Biden will do whatever Obama wants.  Obama is pulling Biden's strings.  If Biden wins, 4 more years of Obama.  Looks like Obama is making another run for "President".  Praying for the Durham Report to take this cocky a-hole down.
Biden will do whatever Obama wants.  Obama is pulling Biden's strings.  If Biden wins, 4 more years of Obama.

Should Biden quit the race? It is hard not to question motives when there is no police report and desire is for a settlement. Going to same reporters who torched team earlier not a great look imho. Mavs female staff members ultimately made the call. NBA can ban him entirely.
No matter how much you might dislike Trump.  Why would you even vote for Biden?  He is obviously mentally compromised and delusional.  He needs to be in a Hospice
No matter How much someone dislikes Trump how can anyone believe this is a better choice.  I firmly believe Biden is mentally incapacitated and could not even order a Happy Meal at McDonald's

wish you were the nominee and not gross joe biden.
I‚Äôm not saying they are great. I know that Obama was the Deporter in chief. I‚Äôm just saying that trump truly just wants us out of here sooner than Obama/Biden ever did. And if you are happy with this 4 yr and how trump does business then, I guess you deserve trump as a president.
Y‚Äôall gonna flip shit when you learn that Obama, Bush, Clinton, Pence, Biden, and Trump are all on the same team.
I do the same thing.  Unless it's funny and AOC or Biden open their trap and I need a laugh.
Wait and see...if Biden gets elected, all of a sudden, HCQ will become a ‚Äúwait it does work!‚Äù drug and Covid will be gone by February.
If Trump wins again, Covid will continue to last ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù, but if Biden wins, Covid will disappear around Feb 2021 right after Biden takes office.
Just as well.  doesn't belong anyplace where honor and courage are celebrated.
Depends. It Trump wins, Covid continues...if Biden wins, *poof* it magically goes away and we‚Äôve found a cure around February if he takes office.

They're working together. Trump was necessary to advance goals quickly before the 70-90 year old Zionist boomer crowd with all the money and political clout dies off. Biden isna bigger Zionist than Trump, he's made Christian congressmen calling themselves "Zionist" a whole thing.
And if you vote for Biden, then you are a traitor and hate America. By the way I am voting for President Trump, and I am not a racist.
Bigfoot is real, but Biden for President lawn signs are mythological!
I understand, but I think that works both ways. There are some secret Biden voters that are GOP who don't want their GOP family and friends to know that they are NOT voting for CORRUPT RACIST TRUMP!!

WOW, pure fucking lies... I guess Mashed Potato Head can't do anything except lie. Biden is not against oil. How about that big old electric self driving truck factory coming to Texas  ? Not that I think electric is bad. Self driving is nuts.
Biden has said in media that he sees himself as a transitional President, so I hope whomever he picks has their eye on the Presidency, as they'd be groomed and listed as the presumptive nominee. This is people getting upset someone who won't back down is getting the VP spot.
People don't vote against a candidate. They vote for a candidate. Zero reason to vote for Biden.

He will still crush Biden, anytime.
The polls are probably BS but if anyone on here takes for granted the stupidity of most Americans or the ones that are just tired of Trumps tweets and won‚Äôt vote period you do so at your own peril!  Biden can and will win if conservatives or independents take this for granted!

You're easily amused. Guess that's why you like Biden
Joe Biden should take the same test live on TV so everyone can see how basic this test is. Notice Trump didn't suggest the same test.I learned something new today  Vote for Trump = Vote for Trump. No Vote at all = Vote for Trump.  I was going for No Vote but I guess I have to Vote for Biden now
Chris Wallace challenges Biden to follow Trump on 'Fox News Sunday,' says ex-VP must 'get into game shape'
maybe I'm crazy, but Biden shouldn't pick an active governor as VP given how badly we need governors to regulate their states rn.
As easy as it is to laugh at them, the concept of "Settle for Biden" is actually really smart and a somewhat valid argument.  I'd rather someone blatantly tell me that Biden is awful, yet Trump is worse than tell me Biden is literally the best presidential candidate to ever exist
While I'm thrilled that Biden has awesome names for his VP short list, I'm not voting for VP. I'm voting for Biden no matter who the VP is.

IMO a protest vote would only be worth it if the current president was a centrist like Biden is. In 2024, I‚Äôll consider. Now is just not the time to fool around, especially living in a potential toss up state like Texas. That‚Äôs my thinking
Did Joseph Biden say that if he ran in 2016 he wouldn't have lost like Hillary Clinton?
......wait until Biden picks a VP....he will lead again until Election Day
Oh yes, I did realize that. What I find appalling is that so many Democrats rush to embrace any Republican who opposes Trump for whatever reason, perhaps not aware that these Republicans ‚ù§ Biden because, like them, he is anti-#WorkingClass and pro-#EndlessWar. üó≥ #2020Election

I'm not a fanatic like a lot of President's constituents,  but I can tell you without a doubt Biden isn't the answer!
But, I agree. As long as he votes for Biden, I'll take it. But, we have to stay woke when it comes to these former Republicans and wake them up.
Those Children put in cages was done by your ass wipe Obama and Biden and you weren‚Äôt whining then. Why don‚Äôt you get your facts straight before you spout a bunch of lies. And that swamp it‚Äôs draining and you‚Äôll be whining again!
I had such respect for both men, but it‚Äôs waning.  They should both be ashamed of themselves for their behavior about this first and most personal decision Joe Biden will make in his quest to beat Trump.
For some reason Biden ‚Äúmust‚Äù have an A-A woman, when an excellent man lots of people like and would be a substantive supportive VP, Cory Booker is sitting there on the bench.  Biden‚Äôs whole process makes no sense.  But I don‚Äôt think it matters who he chooses.  He is up by 15.
Look, I am a former R.  I would not choose her for the reasons you state.  But the Cuban vote that won‚Äôt vote for Donald Trump isn‚Äôt huge and won‚Äôt decide the election where Biden is already taking positions that will peel away a lot of support from the same group.

Laughable. Countless polls show your approval rating in the absolute toilet. You know you are losing which is why you are flailing, crying it‚Äôs fixed already, wanting to move the election etc. Biden isn‚Äôt and has never been some extreme leftist
I‚Äôm honestly indifferent. Granted, it‚Äôs a bigger deal than normal because whoever it is will likely be POTUS long before the end of the first term, IF Biden wins.
Patriots! Biden just solves the COVID epidemic in 3 easy steps!!!! Step 1: we have to depend on what the president is going to do right now! Step 2: wait for the cases before anything happens Step 3:  he has to get in pace things were shortages of!!! Boom! Goodbye COVID.
Does Biden‚Äôs VP pick matter to you?
Of course they did, they want to destroy the documents and protect Biden just like they protected Epstein and Bill Clinton. #DemocratsAreMarxistsDestroyingAmerica
But you endorsed Biden, yo.
maybe since she‚Äôs clearly the groomed/preyed on victim in her relationship with trump, she was too afraid of voting someone else. In the video aswell mentions trump and her parents are friends, possible pressure from them to vote him?   But that‚Äôs just what I think
Aren‚Äôt they kinda forcing Biden to choose Harris? If he has another candidate he could work w better, if he chooses her, then it looks like he‚Äôs agreeing w assholes about ‚ÄúHarris being too ambitious‚Äù. But who knows behind the scenes. Shit. Ask Anita Hill about men being assholes.
And now they want us to vote for his boy Biden. Smh
Over 60 million people were infected with swine flu world wide. Biden has been accused of multiple accounts of sexual assault. Media has already forgotten about Tara Reide.
Biden is 77 years old.  I want a strong black ambitious women ready to step up as his VP
It is obvious Biden has decided that moderates and independents do not matter very much, because his policy statements are systematically groomed to repel them.  No VP, at this point, can fix that, so if he likes Congresswoman Bass, he should run with her.  I am sure he will win.
What did Obama and Biden do for H1N1?
Let me put it differently then.  Donald Trump cannot win without Florida.  Joe Biden definitely can without difficulty.  If the VP candidate is Biden‚Äôs only concern about taking Florida, the election is over.

It's amazing when Biden said in April that Trump was going to try to delay the election the conservatives  had a lot to say. Well Biden was right. So what do you conservatives have to say now. Because y'all was down right mad . Now the truth has come to light.
Your reply shows that Biden totally appeals to republicans and not to people on the left, which is precisely my point.

He doesn't have enough time. November is upon us. His pedo friends will find themselves in court during President Biden's admin. As a former LE Sergeant, inmates will have a field day with these molesters.
This is very true, there is no doubt he is a white-supremacist or harbors white-supremacist ideology. However, in practice, I would say Biden is just as vile as Trump, as his time as a US Senator stands testament to.
obviously they're not voting for BIDEN..show's how much you don't know about what's going on.  It's the Trump supporters that will vote for BIDEN.

That is true... &amp; if he won in 2024, he would join Grover Cleveland as the only Presidents elected in Non-Consecutive terms. He won't be against Biden, however. Joe's VP pick will be President by then!
back when CNN got trashed and the protesters started making "Defund the police" their new motto, Biden suggested raising funding for police when asked by reporters. I dislike this very much and am also to the left of brother sanders

Biden‚Äôs choice of a running mate is not only that a black woman would be a great boost for voter turnout for persons of color, but more importantly what that running mate can do for the down ballot elections. Stacy Abrams could bring 2 US senators with her. This is huge.

WE ALL MUST WAKE UP TO THIS CRIME. THIS COULD BE THE POTENTIAL DOWNFALL OF BIDEN'S ELECTION RESULTS.
Once he loses the election Joe Biden is going to audition to work at Freddy Fazbear's.  He loves children, moves like an animatronic, and lives in your nightmares.
A blunder on top of the blunder of picking Biden as nominee, maybe, but Warren would have pulled in progressives. People are hurting. Hurting people don't care about labels like Socialist, they vote for the candidate who addresses their needs and doesn't spout useless platitudes.
You can do whatever you want.  In fact, I suggest you make calls for Biden if you're that afraid his Republican/Neocon coalition won't come through for him.
Biden says he‚Äôll have a running mate pick next week
Bernie ceding ground immediately and making no real demands of Biden means Biden doesn't have to listen to Bernie or any leftist element. Why?  Because you're still gonna vote for him. And then when he's in power, he'll have even less incentive to listen.
Now do Biden
Biden doesn't care about the noise from conservative media outlets. He's running a conservatively run campaign and (as long as she polls well) she's a conservative choice. She's a ying (foreign policy) to his yang (economy).
‚ÄúEditor's note: An earlier version of this graphic mistakenly reported that Biden had made his VP selection. We regret the mistake.‚Äù  Planned mistake? ü§î
Some analysts have said Biden already priced into the market.
What‚Äôs with Obama &amp;‚ÄôBiden? Here it is. Obama will be the power behind the throne and I believe Susan Rice will be picked for VP. Someone who won‚Äôt cause problems. Obama will be able to call the shots and Biden will shake his head. If they can wake him up.

YALL. Someone goofed up the Matrix, it‚Äôs only July 28th.  #biden #what #someoneisgettingfired #unlessitsfakenews
Biden is going to do better than Clinton did, If barely winning is good enough for you, good luck with that.. But remember Hillary was one of the most hated candidates in history, and even she won the popular vote in 2016.
You‚Äôre living in denial, maybe after one more beating, y‚Äôall will get the message. To bad, it‚Äôs going to take a Biden presidency tho.
It‚Äôs not Biden they want!  The person to run with him as vice will be the actual Pres.!They want it to be a woman. Can‚Äôt you see that? Hillary wants this real bad and is giving big money to Biden. Biden can‚Äôt see this bc he‚Äôs to far gone!also, Kamala!
It‚Äôs ridiculous  and Democrats are only concerned with Race and sex of candidate and not QUALIFICATIONS for Vice President.. Poor decision making already from Biden and his team of flunkies.

Biden doesn't even know what the Trump administration is doing vs covid.  He's proposing solutions that the admin has already implemented for weeks if not months. Trump has already ordered the mass production of every vaccine in the event one of them works.  This is really bad.
Biden was slow .‚Äù..but I‚Äôm sure he had the questions and answers
Reporters clap after Biden speaks but never when  does.
He will be gone once Biden becomes president.

Yea I obviously agree with that. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, since you don‚Äôt like Biden who are you voting for? Waiting on a third candidate or just going with trump?
So Joe Biden claims 100% trump is trying to divide the country while using the powers he has as he explains how he and obama did the same thing
Okay, so you‚Äôre going to say that about Biden (which is totally fine with me), then what would you call trump, who has been documented/accused of doing MUCH worse?

We‚Äôve seen Biden joke, and be witty. Dude blunders, but has traditionally been much clearer and sharp. That wasn‚Äôt good at all.
It‚Äôs HILARIOUS that people think any type of sexual harassment angle supports trump &gt; Biden. One is kinda creepy - the other has several sexual harassment incidents, Stormy Daniels, connections to Epstein, etc. Like, what lol
That is genuinely what Biden is implying and it blowing my mind.
No joke, we somehow went from bashing Hillary for being neoliberal, while she went with pot legalization and a Medicare opt in at 50 while getting Joe Biden and getting a Medicare opt in at 60 and no legalization of weed.   Come on man.
If you think so, keep it up. Hope you‚Äôre ready for Biden tho, and a big I told you so.
The officers are trained in disarming anyone with a weapon. I hate to use Biden logic, but shoot them in the foot if they're shooting towards you. If you murder them, you are instantly worse than the person who shot first.

This isn't true for the majority of the KHive. They've said they'll vote for Biden but don't plan on fundraising, which I think is fair. They've already raised a lot in the lead up to VP. I'm sure there are fringe voters who think differently, but a small amount
So excited... Let‚Äôs get the Presidential debates going! We‚Äôve been waiting for this, between Trump and Joe Biden and his VP
Wow! That‚Äôs awesome, I am excited for the presidential debate between Trump and Joe Biden very excited let‚Äôs start reposting this

Dems see how far up Joe Biden is in the polls and have completely shut down. Why? Because where else are you gonna go? This is what you have as leadership if you are a Dem: feckless right-wing capitulating corporatists.
In that case Biden wouldn‚Äôt make it üòÇ
I am inclined to think that the more places we are prepared to compete, the more places we'll win. Up and down the ballot, we've got a shot in places such as Texas, Arizona and Georgia, but it'll take all we've got.
and what did Obama and Biden accomplish with regard to racism?? They increased it and did absolutely nothing to stop it. You seem to fan the flames of hostility. You are NOT helping.

Have you followed the news at all?  The vote in November will be to remove a mentally unstable man from the White House. Argue policy with Biden all day long, but vote for him because he has basic intelligence and he is stable. To abstain is to vote for Trump.
You know what's at stake? Well, put it in a script and make calls to the non-voters of America for Biden
No one can make this make sense. Vote Biden 2020.
Nah, it'll be Dems' fault, just like last time, because instead of galvanizing the bigger non-voting bloc of America, they stood for nothing and felt entitled to votes. Why don't you get your happy ass off Twitter and start making calls for Biden?
He won't even turn over his donor list to the Biden campaign because he knows it won't go over well with his base. This BS task force didn't present any major concessions and as it stands, Biden doesn't need to cede any ground with people like you bending the knew right away

Don't look now but Biden has pulled ahead for the first time in the  average for Texas.  First time in my life a Democrat has EVER been in the lead. I will cherish this.
"Mark my words... if Biden wins in November America is going to look vastly different!" .... Um? Is that a bad thing
I‚Äôm really starting to realize the less, government in general, gets accomplished, the better off I am. If Biden wins, and GOP keep the senate, we‚Äôre in good shape, they‚Äôll be at a deadlock, if Trump wins, still a deadlock.   I‚Äôm liking this election!!
Ahhhhhhh. We have to work hard to get Biden into office. Way harder than you even think.
I still have hope for 2020 come Nov. 3rd. Vote Biden.

Biden wins, no more Trump. And then what? What exactly are you "Resisting" with Trump that you think you won't get with Biden? Because keep in mind he was in the previous administration BEFORE we got Trump, so maybe that's something that should analyzed a little more, no?

What's so sweet the way Biden mixed demands as if she has any right to do so. When America finds out what you've done to an innocent mother and her children and taxes and how you participated in her torture do you think you're going to have any right to make any demands?
We will! Biden will return us to decency and we will once again be welcome around the world! Guarantee we will not be laughed at! And bonus!? Pompeo, Barr and all the other deeply flawed people will go as well to say nothing of the unqualified , self serving offspring! BONUS!
I live in Texas and my sister and both parents voted Trump and despise him now and will vote Biden. I have hope!

Biden is a puppet and not mentally capable of being president-MI swing voters  ‚ÄúUp there in age‚Äù ‚ÄúShowing signs of dementia &amp; would likely be a puppet‚Äù ‚ÄúBiden is not mentally capable‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat he‚Äôs saying is not making sense to me‚Äù  Yo ‚Å¶
The anti-Hillary vote, of course. ‚ÄúHillary is a known quality that feels BAD, I‚Äôll vote to shake things up!‚Äù Things are quite shaken up, and Trump is, quite frankly a poorly spoken, impulsive asshole. Biden is senile, but he‚Äôs from a more quiet era.
No really, Who's in the running?  Biden can't remember their names.
Obama/Biden allowed 62 MILLION Americans get infected with H1N1 in 2009/2010. They waited FOUR MONTHS to address it. And even then, it was never known how incompetent Obama really was.

This is a good idea for de-corporatizing the federal judiciary‚Äîor at the very least lending it some balance. #Biden2020
You are insanely optimistic. If Biden is elected the resulting administration will make Obama look like a far right conservative in comparison.

He was, until this year. He‚Äôs been a GOP puppet this entire year. Trump should have understood, being targeted by police more than anyone!  I can‚Äôt support federal agents against citizens, even if that means Biden.

A message from Joe Biden üëá
If you vote for Biden you support Pedofile behavior.
I don't expect to sway your opinion. You asked why I support Biden, I simply replied.
A few reasons are he is building off the affordable care act to help restore care for millions of Americans, he also is committed to making 2 year community colleges free for students. And when a civilians approach Biden, he is genuine, and looks them in their eyes. He cares.
Watching Fox this morning and a Dem named Mary Anne Marsh is on. I heard her tell four lies in one minute talking about Trump and defending Biden on defunding the police. If your going to have these people on you need to be prepared to rebut this BS

Dems in power are why these assholes exists through subversion of media, education and other institutions. If Biden wins, it may calm down. If fact, the chaos is what they are using to try to get him into office. Consider the precedent you are setting by allowing them to do that.
Forget Debates.... Biden can‚Äôt even do a Cheesepuff interview?!!!

Joe Biden is the Most DISGUSTING Racist of our time
YOU PICKED A DISGUSTING RACIST AS VP JOE BIDEN &amp; LIED ABOUT WHO HE REALLY IS! You should be ashamed of yourself for letting the KKK BlackFace Democrats EXPLOIT you when Trump is the one who has a record Criminal Justice Reform fixing Joe Biden's WRONGS
For office Mr. Joe Biden no wonder you didnt get anything done on Criminal Justice Reform when it was Joe that authored the Crime Bill which jailed mostly African American males, all Joe Biden, and Dems did and are doing is using you to get Black votes and you just let them
Hmmm same exact photo could be altered for Biden.

Hello Theresa and Happy Joe Biden Thursday!!
You talking about white hoods when Biden &amp; Hillary Clinton are friends with the leader of the KKK.
chose  for a running mate. Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris' family owned slaves. Joe Biden in 1994 signed the violent crime control &amp; law enforcement act which put a lot of blacks in jail repeatedly. Kamala put a lot of black pot smokers in jail laughing about it
First that‚Äôs a lie about Biden and Fraccing. Well known Trump lying. Second. What Fraccing?  West Texas where it‚Äôs done. Has been in a standstill since 2019.  Matter public record. So again Trumps lying. We will Turn Texas Blue!
Jesus, if Biden was ACTUALLY radical Left, I‚Äôd be WAY more happy voting for him. He‚Äôs Centrist as fuck. But compared to that weathered clementine in office, it‚Äôs not a question.
Oh damn. I‚Äôm committed 2 President Trump for 4 more years &amp; I‚Äôm not going 2 try &amp; figure out Bidensüí© that‚Äôs up to Trumps team. We all know we must dedicate our energy &amp; time 2 re-elect Pres. Trump. No energy wasted on Biden we/he already shows he has none.

Biden ‚Äúdon‚Äôt listen to the politicians- but I‚Äôm a politician ‚Äú - classic Sleepy Joe.
BLM only cares about Black Lives killed by a white police officer. They seem not care at all if it's innocent black people and their children being murdered in the streets, which happens way more. They received 40 million in donations are the going to help communities? Or Biden
Exactly. I have been stating that these people have Stockholm's syndrome if they are willing to vote for Biden. The Democrats are insane. We need to shut them down NOW!!!
We need a real leader not Trump or Biden
Biden Is going to
Biden will Obviously WIN.
And Joe Biden is Colluding with China
Ah Kamalatoe already knows that Biden is a Racist
Even his VP knows Joe Biden is a Racist, my Lord Kamala imprisoned more African American men then Bidens Policies

Brother, the fact that voters aren't enthusiastic for Biden proves my point. Voters are doing what they did in 2016, they are voting AGAINST a candidate they do not want in charge. Old people are a large block of the Republican vote and they don't trust Trump during the pandemic
Biden was told to put on a show of concern, mostly likely he didn‚Äôt remember who was in the coffin
It actually has nothing to do with the media painting Trump as a Nazi. It's more about him not handling covid well, that's the reason old folks in Florida are flipping over to Biden. They are terrified for their lives and Trump doesn't even hold press conferences on covid anymore
Tell him quit lying. Oh he can‚Äôt. Then he wont have anything to Tweet. Every word out his mouth is a lie. VOTE BIDEN
I think Susan Rice is the best choice: not super political, extremely prepared wrt nat security, tough demeanor, good speaker, prior relationship with Biden. I agree about Kamala, she has opportunistic vibe.

I understand that but there were candidates in the beginning that had potential to me and they're all out. Even YOU say you're not thrilled with Biden but dont want Trump to win, many people are saying this. Nobody is happy about the selection we have, that's the problem. Why??

And you also missed the theme of my tweet. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he thinks will be the best partner whether black or non-black. No one can coerced him to pick any woman. I only wish he picks a qualified black woman....my personal wish.
Lol....Who am I to rewrite history. Endorsing immediately or the attack on the debate stage has no bearing on who Joe Biden picks. He will pick whoever he feels will be the best partner for him. I just wish he picks a qualified black woman. Period!!! That's my personal wish.
Nothing personal. All these tweeter talks won't determine who JB picks. He will pick the best person for himself....my statement about picking a qualified black woman is my personal view that has no effect on who Joe Biden picks.
I am not campaigning for anyone but I wish Joe Biden picks one of the qualified black women. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he wants but in my opinion EW will be the worst pair for JB because they are not "simpatico" at all. I love EW...she is qualified to be POTUS
You don't need to be confused because it is a straightforward message. Let me state it again...No matter who Joe Biden picks (whether white or non-white), people(whether blacks or non-blacks)will still vote for him but there will be certain blacks that will feel betrayed
I never threatening not to vote for Joe Biden....FYI Joe Biden was my number one candidate during primary....I was sad when he wasn't performing well in the first three primary/caucus. I love Kamala Harris but if JB feels she is not the right person for him so be it. There are
Imagine Joe Biden was President when China spread Covid thru the world.  No China travel ban.  Joe told us China isn‚Äôt a threat.  Banning China travel was racist.  Joe sold out to China.. they made Hunter and Joe rich.

Yes, more than now. Communists will not stop if Biden wins. If they have a president that supports their violence, they will do it more.
Welp, Biden will kiss her Bass goodbye. Or not. It's 2020, who the hell knows?
No it was NOT! His administration actually admitted ‚Äúthey got lucky‚Äù. They also never replenished the needed stockpiles of PPE &amp; equipment they used. Obama/Biden- worst administration EVER.
I have wanted Kamala Harris from the get go. I was very interested in her as a Presidential candidate. In the end, I will vote for the ticket no matter who Joe Biden picks. They all have pluses and minuses.
My advice is everyone voting for Biden vote in person! Most states have in person early voting for at least 3 weeks before Election Day! Plan to wait, wear and mask and socially distance! Trump has made it clear he will contest mail in ballots cast for Biden!
He will and we will forgive him because it is bigger than Biden. The current occupant of the White House is an existential threat.

Absolutely! And part of the classification problem is that Democrats are the only reasonable major US party at the moment (in an infuriatingly condescending way), so they attract more people under that umbrella than any 1 ideology. It's the party of both AOC and Biden.

I agreed. Delay until Biden is ready to come out of his basement.... basically forever
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.

Maybe. But other "leaders" on both sides have been seen in gatherings without masks (e.g. Biden in his "announcement" yesterday). Face masks to prevent contracting the virus is inconclusive. It's also bad form to speak ill of the man. Send condolences instead blame.
In this clip Kamala Harris pretty explicitly opposes legalized marijuana while her GOP opponent supports it.  She'd fit Biden's opposition to legal weed quite nicely.

I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
OHHHH!!! I was wondering. I haven‚Äôt read the article but let‚Äôs remember folks: Beto AND Kamala stayed for Biden‚Äôs rally here in Dallas. Mayor Pete? He met w/ him before, endorses him &amp; left. It‚Äôs been Beto all along gin up the TX Dems for Joe!! He‚Äôs campaigning daily to flip TX!
One of us will be right on Nov 4th and one of us will be sad. I like my chances of a Biden Presidency and a Dem controlled House and Senate so we will see.
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
Well he did lose by 1.5million votes so the polls where correct. They also correctly predicted 2018 and Dems actually outpformed what polls suggested so taking 2018 into account, I'm very optimistic Biden will be President.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Seems degrading no? Like Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù

They do want to destroy it.  Their agenda is to completely rebuild America to fit their ideas and beliefs.  Joe Biden, in one of his few lucid moments, said this very thing just a few weeks ago.

Do you know the NFL'S they pay millions of dollars to BLM and guess what that money goes to Joe Biden's election and the other part the other ones who are donating money goes to the ones who are destroying the city Soros give 40 million dollars 2 DNC to pray for the thugs
That's why you and all you party is hoping for and that's why you want me mail ballots easy to cheat that's why we want President Trump to drain the swamp too much cheating Joe Biden has been in office 48 years or more never accomplish anything
Wonder what Joe Biden would say about that in a debate w/  would he even be asked that question, not if Jim Acosta's there.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN
not me no way can't happen.   my brain's pudding like Joe Biden's.
Well I would like to see these people that actually like him, anywhere I go I see people whining about Biden, it seems like people are voting for him ONLY because they dont want Trump to win again. How does it all come down to something ridiculous like that?
There were candidates in 2016 and this one that I wouldve given my vote to but they're out! But you are right, not enough people vote for the candidates with common sense. Tho, if nobody is thrilled about voting for Biden, how is he even a candidate??
I understand that but there were candidates in the beginning that had potential to me and they're all out. Even YOU say you're not thrilled with Biden but dont want Trump to win, many people are saying this. Nobody is happy about the selection we have, that's the problem. Why??
Ask him if he is voting for Biden now??

This mobs as you called them they having pay prearranged by the Democratic Party and the four quads AOC posted that letter on Twitter Twitter keep erasing it it reads Mayors keep doing the same thing you doing after election we need to get rid of trump and help Joe Biden win .
AOC advise in the mayors to standby after Joe Biden wins that's the only way they can get President Trump out of office I turning upside down these country find that later has been posted on Twitter many times don't be so stupid you guys from Fox News find the letter do something

Biden‚Äôs team asked Pardon My take for an interview and they declined. This was prior to the trump one. I guess both guys are trying to work the younger crowd.
And you also missed the theme of my tweet. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he thinks will be the best partner whether black or non-black. No one can coerced him to pick any woman. I only wish he picks a qualified black woman....my personal wish.
Lol....Who am I to rewrite history. Endorsing immediately or the attack on the debate stage has no bearing on who Joe Biden picks. He will pick whoever he feels will be the best partner for him. I just wish he picks a qualified black woman. Period!!! That's my personal wish.
Nothing personal. All these tweeter talks won't determine who JB picks. He will pick the best person for himself....my statement about picking a qualified black woman is my personal view that has no effect on who Joe Biden picks.
I am not campaigning for anyone but I wish Joe Biden picks one of the qualified black women. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he wants but in my opinion EW will be the worst pair for JB because they are not "simpatico" at all. I love EW...she is qualified to be POTUS
You don't need to be confused because it is a straightforward message. Let me state it again...No matter who Joe Biden picks (whether white or non-white), people(whether blacks or non-blacks)will still vote for him but there will be certain blacks that will feel betrayed
I never threatening not to vote for Joe Biden....FYI Joe Biden was my number one candidate during primary....I was sad when he wasn't performing well in the first three primary/caucus. I love Kamala Harris but if JB feels she is not the right person for him so be it. There are
Imagine Joe Biden was President when China spread Covid thru the world.  No China travel ban.  Joe told us China isn‚Äôt a threat.  Banning China travel was racist.  Joe sold out to China.. they made Hunter and Joe rich.
Could of, should of, would of Biden is not the President and that is that! President Orange is &amp; he is the F*CK UP!
If Joe Biden chooses a white woman, we-the blacks- will definitely complain and feel betrayed but we will vote for him no matter what....just that the massive black turnouts that is needed for the victory will definitely not be there in November 3rd. So he might lose like HRC.

Great endorsement for Biden
Joe Biden has every right to choose whoever he wants as his VP but to be candid none of these two women you mentioned in your poll can bring out the massive turnout JB needs to win. Tammy Duckworth is minimally better than Karen Bass but there are far better women on the list.
lol fuck neera tho seriously, she's the biggest injury of a Joe Biden Presidency by a mile.
I am an urban mom, grandmom &amp; great grand mom I am the care giver for my hubby with dementia I am voteing for Biden .
I already have those rumors if Joe Biden wins who's going to replace him it will be Obama she will try this country like Venezuela they have already started by destroying statues and the defunded the Policeman..
Oh and they want these destroyed this country destroy our culture destroy history when they are the one who had the slavery plantations are the racist mostly Joe Biden he called President Trump racist we the people know who you are a pedophile racist and we got proof your records
Jor Biden is embarrassing to watch ü§° Nobody believes those fake polls!
Pay attention 8 yrs  Obama, Biden team. Why were you negligent, why didn't they "mattered," to you?
We already knew that the he is running only He's name the one is running is Obama Hillary Clinton they are the ones who are campaigning for Joe Biden day and by a phone you got Hollywood and the rest of that liberal Democrats campaigning this country will be run like Venezuela.
Your Stupidity is showing Again.. Biden 2020üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
Biden can‚Äôt even ask that.  Without a prompter
Bc that‚Äôs what awaits us if Biden wins.  Trump is offering to help these communities but your Biden backing mayors do not accept.
This is under Trump he sent them in not Biden.. Stop it, stop it the Evil that is here it was brought by the Devil himself through TRUMP! TRUMP ! TRUMP! he is the Devil himself.
Joe Biden he's a disgusting pedophile and with a history being a racist I do not understand why people of color keep following him they know that Democrats were the ones that owns these plantations Republicans liberate slavery black people don't appreciate they keep following Dem
Hey look, Joe Biden got an early start in Portland!  Too bad the current President couldn't stop this. (wait...)I personally think Biden should pick a candidate that will give him electoral votes in a swing state. Honestly what Ed Rendell is thinking is relevant in that this is how middle aged white guys think. And they do show up to vote. Sexism is not history unfortunately.
You must be speaking of the once austere Barack H. Obama Like other corrupt politicians he attained wealth and power in Washington on your dime...Joe Biden paid off...Hillary paid off...Bill Clinton well you know what he likes..buy Donald Trump üòÑüòÇü§£ he was already a billionaire
He‚Äôs helping Biden. Was not needed at a funeral.
so you wont be voting for biden then huh? cant stand up to his own son selling his vp spot, or his family..
The lame stream media prop him up like they do Biden.
Why would he be terrified you douchbag.  He is worth a few billion.  If he is elected again, which is probably going to happen, he will lead this country for 4 more years.  If by some chance the AMERICAN people do the unthinkable and elect brain dead Biden he will play golf.
(2/2) I am not sure what I am more frightened about, Trump getting reelected or a President Biden.  Petulance vs incompetence 2020
Went this morning to Highway 191 just yards northwest of the 16R runway at Midland International Airport to greet  Air Force One...with my "Vote Joe Biden 2020" sign!
This Texan doesn't stand for idiots like Biden.
‚ÄúCommon sense‚Äù ain‚Äôt so common anymore in 2020 otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be using a Biden 2020 flag as your profile photo.   Common sense would tell you he is and always will be controlled by Marxist that hate AMERICA the country you live in.   You‚Äôre great at proving my point.
Loses to Biden?? Are you on crack üíÄüíÄüíÄ
The word is WHEN Biden wins. And yes, we‚Äôre all screwed then
Biden is way more transparent and honest than President Trump. I would mark your foolish tweet as a false equivalency.
Who said anything about Biden? Deflect much?
If I don‚Äôt get to watch a Trump/Biden debate, then what‚Äôs this all been about? What have I been working towards?
Biden needs to be put in a fuckin nursing home poor bastard has zero clue what is even going on

Please let Biden rest. This should be elder abuse.
Oh come on   cut away from interesting AG Barr hearings to a presser with sleepy Joe Biden #gullable
Your clothes are gone.  Buying more will get worse with Biden.  Your money will go in his pockets.
I think Obama will pick Susan Rice as Biden's VP.
Biden is a joke once again.
They should pay the price but doubt they will. What's new!  Biden hates oil and gas yet sure bought into in. We in the Permian Basin are counting on you to get us back. Trump 2020
joe biden is now all about trump as well. biden hates republicans, wont even address us.. who would want that as a president? even if youre an anti trump republican, this biden guy wont even acknowledge you!! joe biden hates america
On Tuesday Democrats holding a parade in the evening driving through town with Biden supporters !  Democratic County Chair organized it. We don't know where oil rig is or we would protest !
Lol he said likewise Texas. I‚Äôll be voting for Biden as soon as early voting starts.
Yes I do! I feel any vote not for Biden is a vote for trump
Golfing with Brett Farvre while Texas is battling record high covid deaths, a hurricane and huge economic crisis? Sure come to Midland on Wednesday! You can see a sea of Biden signs as you land from Air Force One!
Is it me or do we have a lot of fools in America supporting the rioters.  I know we have Democrat governors supporting them.  Geez!!   People if you are planning on voting for Biden please listen to what he supports.
Joe Biden is a joke and needs to go to bed and eat ice cream
Trump is A racist and Biden is A pedophile .. can we get new candidates ! üëèüèªüëèüèª
I live in midland. I'm a precinct chair for the Democrats and we are getting record requests for Biden yard signs. And we are supposedly reddest part of Texas!
Trump was never Vice President. I was speaking on Biden, sir. Keep up with the conversation. Is English even your primary language?
Beat It, Thriller, And Billy Jean (Michael was the Prince of Pop) (Also, Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt tell them apart)
Midland had one per cent unemployment when Obama handed the reigns to Trump. Today it looks like a ghost town. Biden can restore the Texas economy.  #JoeBidenJob
Especially when your a puppet and just want votes. That‚Äôs all Biden is, he‚Äôs a puppet that will say or do anything whether it is right or wrong just to benefit himself with a vote or monetarily. That‚Äôs all he is, that is what is wrong with America
That‚Äôs a specific question. The riots are not related to Floyd whatsoever.  But you keep banking on allowing that to happen and showing the rest of America what can and will happen if Biden is elected.  I‚Äôll bet the majority of Americans don‚Äôt agree.LOL rigged I see. If Biden happens to win all you morons are gonna do is blame Mail in voting and say the machines were rigged just like you did with Obama.
There is nothing good about dividing our country, or making an ass out of himself on Twitter and TV. While I‚Äôm not exactly the biggest Joe Biden fan I could tolerate his administration a lot more than Trump, and this is coming from a Bernie Sanders voter.
Without poorly Trump is handling this coronavirus thing and that fact he‚Äôs concerned that he is losing popularity he‚Äôs scared. Also too last time a lot of people didn‚Äôt see Trump for the monster that he is and if this Coronavirus crap gets getting out of hand Biden may win.
Did anyone ask if Biden would be disloyal to Obama?  Didn‚Äôt think so

Your vote means nothing if you vote for shit like Biden or Trump. It only means something if you vote for what you stand for. Otherwise you are just a stooge for the Republicans and Democrats.  And don't be fooled, they are the same.
Notice they are bringing back the Obama faithful! Biden = 4 more years of Obama‚Äôs haneous policies that were so bad for America.
That‚Äôs because we‚Äôre not emotionally invested with trump like others. To them he can never do no wrong. I really don‚Äôt care who goes down. I don‚Äôt view anyone as a hero. Trump will save himself over before anyone else.
Sure bitch.
He sort of holds the highest position in the country right now. lol.
‚ÄúLife is a slam dunk when you living with low goals‚Äù -  - Joe Biden probably ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
He didn‚Äôt. The states will run the election, he will lose, and if he‚Äôs still in the White House when Biden becomes president, I will watch the Secret Service drag him out
Surely No One possibly believes that Biden would be the Real President if elected. Maybe Clinton, Obama, Someone, but not him. Was never the plot.
Sweety the first thoughts are okay but there really aren't any progressives, including Biden.
Everyone thinks so but Joe Biden.
Welcome to the pilot of the Democrat Inquisition 2.0. The witnesses at the Salem Witch Trials were afforded more rights. Under Biden political and policy differences become a state crime ... mob justice.
What if Joe Biden gets it? Who will become the Democrat candidate?
You should just stick to speaking for Florida.Joe Biden is blue and as crooked as the come. We have all seen he quid pro quo video with Ukraine. He can care less about anyone but himself. There is no way he is winning Texas.
And the rest of America yawned ... Jayapal is an incompetent joke. They defied Trump, so it will be equally easy to defy Biden.
A trip to London or Paris.  Voting for Biden.
Elon Musk for Biden VP
No but disappointed that #Murdoch gave millions to Biden. No more  for me.
Unfortunately the owner of your network supports Biden so I‚Äôve turned off
Mind your own business. Trust me you won‚Äôt want to be our neighbor if Biden wins.
Questions for Biden were really hard. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite color?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat state are we in?‚Äù
I‚Äôm with you.  I think fauci will look a lot like Biden-political and demented
Joe Biden holds rallies in the meeting hall of a community center and stands there in silence. Trump holds rallies in stadiums and stands amidst a thundering roar of America-loving patriots.
I hate to say this but watching Biden take questions from reporters is painful. He looks so weak..
Biden isn‚Äôt perfect and wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice, but seriously?
That‚Äôs just good for joe biden. She‚Äôs a terrorist. As a ploy-that could get Biden votes
Maybe it's just taking a while to get all of the charges in order before the targeted people are rounded up.  Regardless, something needs to be done soon.  It would be a dereliction of duty and devastating if it's not done and the unthinkable happens-Biden wins.
Really sad. Wouldn‚Äôt wish what Biden has on anyone.
Its Biden trying to keep you down and silenced
Dude, where have you been?  Trump is trying to open schools and Biden and Dems want them closed.  What do you not get?
I understand the thinking, but Biden and Dems need to do what‚Äôs best for the people and not let Trump and  drive this narrative.     I wish we can have 4 VPs!  So many great choices!
You think Joe Biden is a real candidate. Too much CNN for you guys!
I dont care about biden. Whatever his problems are hes not as bad as trump. Trump also the guy who said if you don't test you won't have  coronavirus case. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇ
When Joe Biden says that Donald Trump is the first racist president (it follows his supporters as well) he‚Äôs not saying that Trump hates black and brown people? And if Joe is making that claim, are his statements getting the attention they deserve?
funny how you are tied in Texas according to polls, but in NTX only Trump signs and flags fly. Nothing, absolutley nothing for crazy Joe Biden.
Did you mean Joe Biden or the husband of Joe Biden?
School reopening will be followed by an even larger outbreak of COVID-19 sickening countless thousands of entire families. This will guarantee Biden wins every state and very few Republicans will be re-elected for any public office.

Then Vote Biden....
‚ÄúIf Biden becomes president we will become full-blown Nazis.‚Äù
He‚Äôs just working for trump trying to take away votes from Biden so Trump will win...
This was yall second chance to elect  but once again yall blew it. Now we stuck with Biden, Trump, and Kanye West as our 3 main options. What has this world come to?
and trump and multiple republicans are trying to make a change biden wants to keep all those criminals in jails he did it back in the 90s he‚Äôll do it again he doesn‚Äôt care about this shit. and neither do democrats.
Support Biden?  That‚Äôs funny.  I‚Äôm not sure if he can even spell his own name anymore...And what, exactly, are the ‚Äúlocal and state police‚Äù doing?  I generally DON‚ÄôT support more federal involvement with anything, however, when the local imbeciles refuse to do anything.
That Biden is weak and for sale
Guess who should be Biden‚Äôs VP???üëèüëè
- I must agree with that statement.
I don‚Äôt agree with everything the Democratic Party does even though I am a member of the party, for example I didn‚Äôt agree with them choosing Joe Biden over Bernie Sanders, and I‚Äôm not into the PC Police shit either.
Without saying anything about any other candidates, why would you vote for Joe Biden? I‚Äôm interested to hear what they think is so great about Joe.
Biden‚Äôs proposal is to increase the tax rate for people making over 400k/year from...  Wait for it....  37% to 39.6%. The horror üò±
Joe Biden calls Trump the country's 'first' racist president:  via  - Same old Dem rhetoric.  Not a bit of racism in Trump.  Absolutely no evidence of it.  There have been several racist presidents in the past.  One is a liberal icon - LBJ.
THANK YOU BIDEN OBAMA
As opposed to Biden-following thugs?
The nastiest trailer house in rowlett road has a Biden sign. Also Hillary and Obama at same house. This is rowlett Texas. 1 sign

I just hope Biden will speak to the 3, Only 3, options for us infidels according to islam. Convert, slavery, or death.You haven't seen nothing yet. If Biden and his cronies ever gets in it's going to make that proposed increase look like chump change.

Joe Biden could pick a Sasquatch for his VP pick and I would still vote for him at this point.
Governor, while we are on the subject of Biden's Black woman selection as VP, I expect a White female voter backlash as a result. As a Pres. contender, his decision should never have been based on race but who was the best qualified. But women should be considered not by race.
President Biden I really believe that Karen Bass should be your VP. She has a wonderful spirit just like you
PRESIDENT BIDEN dont worry he is out of there we about to take America back and the house and Senate we sick of all of them dam dummies
Did you know that Biden is beating you in three red states that you won in 2016?  And not by a small margin, either.  He's beating you by a lot. I'm thinking it has something to do with the over 149,000 American citizens you have killed, but I could be wrong. #VoteBlue2020

He has a right to his opinion. But, has he looked at the other guy?  Biden is not perfect; no candidate is/was, but he's a criminal, madman.
That's not true. He won the most votes for "Most Fucked Up Person Ever". He won in a landslide. Obama and Biden didn't receive a single vote.
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
Truthfully Mr. President, I don't think Obama had any option to come forward because Biden could become a loose cannon and implicate him and others in the scheme to bring you down.Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre safe. They endorsed Biden. Why should democrats be concerned?

Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
I‚Äôm confused. Do you and Eric think Joe Biden is an abducted child? Or did you confuse it with a Silver Alert? That would at least make sense. Haha he‚Äôs old. Is there an alert for narcissistic and corrupt millionaires?
Saw it. You don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm level of Biden when you read from the teleprompter. But I suppose it‚Äôs the only way to prevent you for sabotaging your own campaign.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Don't ask that question homie... you know you only asked that because you feel guilty for getting paid by Biden and the Clinton/Obama administration
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
Possibility 1; Biden is elected with Hillary Clinton as his V.P. and the Speaker of the House, Pelosi pushes the 25th amendment to rid the country of Biden and ...TA DA.. Hillary becomes President.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Absolutely not, idgaf if you win, Biden wins, or Mickey Mouse wins, get this shit over with

You need to add Biden to your daily statement!!!
It's actually odd because Trump was for M4A but then you saw how corporate republicans (Koch brothers people) brain washed him. That's why Trump voters in the mid West are going to vote for Biden because he changed absolutely nothing.
Yet again, Biden is much better than the green party candidate this time around. How am I going to vote for a guy who supports internet censorship.
Disgraceful
To say there is nothing fundamentally different from #Trump &amp; #Biden makes u a Socialist for   Yes  gets $$ from Big Corporations &amp; Billionaires but the  wants to cut SS/MEDICARE not the  Are u working for Trump's Campaign????
All the more reason to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho &amp; support  and keep the fight for #MedicareForAll on going. If  &amp; the  wins because  Supporters didn't vote for #Biden #Medicare will be cut.
Amen to that..   If Biden wins, nothing good will come of it.   I have never believed in a President more than yourself President Trump.   I truly believe you have We, the people's, best interest at heart.  #MAGA #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #Trump2020LandslideVictory
I do too, if I thought Bernie would be able to beat Trump I would‚Äôve voted for him because he proposes the quickest path to universal coverage. But I know that he would‚Äôve been destroyed by Trump so I voted for Biden who serves as a more round about way towards universal coverage
Did you expect them to approve it when the candidate who supported it lost to the one who didn‚Äôt? Like I get being annoyed but why would you be surprised, more Democrats support Biden than Bernie so obviously the party wouldn‚Äôt put M4A on the platform.
If Biden wins the Democratic Party will be gone in five years? That‚Äôs a bold prediction!
#Biden is ahead in the polls n Texas #TurnTexasBlue

And what does senile old Biden know about the virus?  He‚Äôs too senile to understand anything!
Yes Biden is the dog right???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump gives me more hope then Biden ever could cause he knows how to rebuild the economy - built the best in the world bf the China virus and will do it again!  Biden will send all the jobs to China like him and Obama did before !
Nope that‚Äôs trump!  He wants to help with the destruction going on in the Democrat run cities!  Biden has said nothing about the anarchists and wants to defund police!
No one has been better to the military than trump!  Biden and Obama cut our military down to nothing!  Trump rebuilt it!  FACT!!!
Nope!  Trump‚Äôs already on that!  Dems don‚Äôt want their kids in school.  They want them to be stupid and lazy so they can fall in line with the socialists under Biden!
He will be escorted out of the WH or not, the WH is just a symbol. Biden can use Mitch McConnell's office.
Joe Biden: 'People' don't distinguish between Chinese and other Asians  via
Hi, I'm suburban, married, and for the last 4 months I've been working from home because of YOU. Now, you are bringing violence to our cities even though no one wants your knock off SWAT teams.  YOU are the problem.  Biden is the solution.  #Biden2020
No Biden signs or bumper stickers seen.
I think you're confused about whether this is a theoretical America run by Joe Biden or an actual America run by Donald Trump.    It's the second one.  You're right: scary.
Biden hasn‚Äôt been correct about anything in several years and he doesn‚Äôt remember that.
Probably because of this: ‚ÄúBiden says Trump is America‚Äôs first ‚Äòracist‚Äô president.‚Äù
"How Caregiving Became More Than Just a Women‚Äôs Issue" by Claire Cain Miller via NYT
Big issue with Biden is if he wins he's going to be extremely averse to the kind of truth and reconciliation work we need. He's constitutionally averse to that kind of stuff.But probably Biden is also considering Duckworth?
At this point Biden should just pick Tammy Duckworth. There is nothing controversial about her.

I‚Äôm so looking foward to the Texas and Georgia updates. I believe it goes like this if Biden wins Georgia he wins Texas and if Biden wins Texas he wins Georgia. About the VP pick a leak has said Biden picked Harris.
So true!  Now do Biden.
how are you going to get Hiden Biden out of the basement?? #maga #trump2020
I agree but I would say this is because of the presidential election year. It‚Äôs very hard to defeat an incumbent senator in a presidential election year when the nominee for president carries a certain state. Joe Biden is likely to carry Michigan and this means Peters wins also.
What‚Äôs strange is that there is a quote from Biden apparently.
I just heard the reason they said no. Because right now Democrat‚Äôs don‚Äôt have any power to make Medicare for all. Biden needs the House and senate makes perfect sense.
That‚Äôs why whenever I see a dead heat in Nevada I don‚Äôt believe it. Biden for sure will carry Nevada and he will probably win by a similar margin that Obama did in 2012.
Yeah vote Biden
President Biden
How do you think Republicans should handle a Supreme Court nomination if they are in the majority and there‚Äôs a President Biden?
Why you so worried about Joe Biden? Sounds like you scared

[Biden's clearly not up to being President, can't even campaign or follow his cue cards. His corruption, his go-along-to-get-along history disqualifies him completely! So the rumors that he's only a placeholder makes sense. Nancy to step in with Hillary?]
James is definitely a very good candidate, but I don‚Äôt think he will lose because of himself. The presidential election is more polarized for certain Senate races meaning that if Biden wins Michigan, I think it will be hard for James to win.
Chris Wallace will softball Joe Biden! He will NEVER PRESS HIM LIKE HE DID TRUMP#swampcreature

Either Trump or Biden will win by a .1 margin to 2.5 margin.Begging Joe Biden I‚Äôll hold on to my cash not in the habit of giving it to pedophilies you and your handlers I‚Äôll give it to Trump cause he‚Äôs in it to win it

Libs are so fucking condescending telling people to vote rn. I‚Äôd much rather watch the Democratic establishment crash and burn so the American Left can be reconstructed than be complicit in some stupid ass resistance narrative. I refuse to vote for Joe Biden. Argue w/ the wall.

biden, since she voting for you she is black yes?  lmao
yes, they are not being fair. Covid 19 should not dictate mail or in person voting. it should just be moved up in all fairness to everyone. Biden is not fighting the Covid 19 either. Trump is, and thats global and More important. But it is the Democrats taking advantage, FEAR
I have 2 weeks before i have to find a tent and safe place for bella and i can go. Maybe a month but i dont like waiting last minute to do things. Lets keep our hearts strong and our minds United. This is a fight no one can afford to loose. Vote Biden.
Still base baiting. They are with you. They might even vote for you. It was those voters that thought "I'll give 'ol donnie a shot," and now they are voting for Joe Biden. Plus we Democrats are turning out in droves. You need new voters. What are you doing to get them?
NOPE, still loving yeah J.Biden and from the looks of the polls, which oddily are dropping for old Trumpy, these meme is lol, hilarious. But nice try
Not me I‚Äôm on his ass everyday dope feen Hunter Biden
For the last 4 years, anything &amp;  everything Trump is FOR, the Democrats and Never Trumpers are AGAINST.   Trump knows this.  He is three steps ahead of these people.   He is just trolling the TDS lunatics on Twitter.   Why give the Democrats more time to replace Biden?
Don't worry! We are voting no matter what. You are not paying attention. Nothing is going to stop me from voting for Joe Biden and blue down the ticket.  While you are distracted by mail-in ballots we are still voting you out. Plus don't even try to deny the results when you lose
Needed to talk to him how he could cheat again!! Any rumors on Biden??
just a thought, i don‚Äôt know how it works, but when polling people call and ask if i‚Äôm voting for trump or biden in november... and i say trump... and if we all say trump... will he not advertise as much? then we can vote biden and chuckle to ourselves?
fan cast: joe biden as billy
Really what the hell are they thinking is this what China told them to do if they want to keep getting there stock options in Chinese businesses they already got Hunter Biden dealing out the 1.5 billion him and Daddy Joe Biden picked up from them or is it the Ukraine money ?
Really Biden is a Clown that only knows where he is if someone tells him. You people are just like him I guess.
The Democratic Party are attached at the hip with China Pelosi is running off at the mouth China is backing Joe Biden Hunter is passing out some of the 1.5 billion him and Joe got from China did you think we forgot that   you are bought and payed for seahag

I will remember. I will be voting with millions of others for Joe Biden!   #Biden2020Landslide
Also this makes it really hard for me to openly support biden now, he just kinda called for my persecution
But like fr why are both presidential candidates calling for political dissidents to be prosecuted, like wtf why would Biden propagate the same awful rhetoric trump is
Fuck you biden lol
Remember guys ‚Äúwe are gonna bully Biden to the left‚Äù lmfao he won‚Äôt do bare minimum reformism and is talking about angry left anarchists

Can I please vote for Joe Biden first isn‚Äôt that what you want
Vote Joe Biden. And Discover a Path Forward we All Can Appreciate. This Is United States not Few States!!!
The BLM movement started during obamas term, donyou unironically think im arguing that biden would actively support leftist direct action, because thats not my point. Trump is noticeably more antagonistic to the cause, and his rhetoric is actively McCarthyist and fascistic
What exactly is your solution if not voting in biden to remove trump, even if the only positive thing that happens is white nationalisms growth is slowed down? Im absolutely serious, what do you recommend leftists do if you font think voting trump out matters
Wait a minute I just heard Joe Biden said he would do that is late for his meds again
Ive had lots of conversations with people who do genuinely think they‚Äôre the same, which even with an incredibly harsh position on Biden, thats just not true. That being said, some of them are accelerationists, and some think its revolution time, both of those groups are wrong to
Or OR hear me out.  We vote in biden to get rid of the FASCIST, and then spend four years absolutely shitting on biden for being an idiot while participating in direct action and mutual aid. I know its alot to take in, but its actually possible, to do more than one thing
dear dr Biden,  please remind mr Biden although he has got our votes in order to get more votes he should speak slower, clear and with an emphasize on his key points!!! Like a leader...Thank you mam!!
Oh Neil Cavuto sucking on Biden‚Äôs Johnson
Mr Biden although you got my vote, however, please note when speaking, do so like a leader meaning do speak sports fast and emphasize words that you like to be making a point of...thank you sir!
I am aggressively leftist and will be ridin with biden until the exact moment he wins
It was ALL planned! THIS was anything BUT a hearing my friend! Meanwhile, Biden: lying, accusing Trump constantly, fake details to reporters! All this is meant to undermine our current administration! Bunch of bull____!
Why can't they STOP this CONSTANT accusations hurled at a 'supporter of the President'!? That's what this is ALL about! Hatred towards our country and the current administration! Meanwhile, this FAKE idiot "Biden" ranting on about the shit he will do. SICK!
Personally, I don't think Trump made America great, so the word "Keep" really bothers me and invalidates the slogan. However, "Build Back Better" sounds like a fifth-grader wrote it, which makes sense given Biden's mental capacity.  I'd give the nod to "Keep America Great."
This is who‚Äôs really behind Biden‚Äôs (BBB) campaign
How anyone can support Obama/Biden after all this has come to light is beyond me.
Would you like to see the files case against trump, for the 13 year? I‚Äôve known about her and the 15 yr since 2015, why I never liked him. Just being friends with ALOT of weirdos pointed that out. But oddily, no one EVER called Biden out the 8 yrs he was VP ü§î
I can literally see him being like ‚Äúnope, we didn‚Äôt lose. In fact we won, yes we won this wonderful election  Biden fought long and hard but it just wasn‚Äôt enough‚Äù if he loses   What happens if Donald Trump refuses to accept the election results?
I‚Äôd say that if Biden wins (üôèüèº), the 77 days after the election will be the most horrific. If Biden loses, the next four years will be hell for us all....and possibly the undoing of America.

Yes, definitely. History is on Trump‚Äôs side. Americans tend to like incumbent Presidents to remain in office. Biden is in the mold of Dole, Kerry or Romney who tried and failed to unseat a popular President. Trump‚Äôs on par with Obama eight years ago. I think he‚Äôll win easily.

Bunker Boy? You mean Biden right? Trump has been traveling around the country. He was in Rapid City, SD recently at Mt. Rushmore for Independence Day. Maybe you saw that. He also spoke in Oklahoma. Where has Biden traveled to?
So Joe Biden (richer than average American) is going to hell too? Pretty sure God judges us by our actions. Trump paid off the mortgage of a family who helped him when his car broke down. Trump regularly handed out $100 bills to his hotel staff. Didn‚Äôt have to run for president.
Friends who are considering voting for Biden, please remember that you can easily write in Kanye West. Visionary, artist and warrior for criminal justice reform. He is a solid choice for Democrats!
Never Trump zealots think that if Biden wins the GOP will suddenly re-embrace them and liberalize.   It‚Äôs not going to happen. We‚Äôre not going back to the pre-Trump consensus and we‚Äôre certainly not handing the keys of the party back to the people who betrayed it.
Jeff get off the drugs. What your obsession of bashing Trump on the head. We already know you were under the desk shining Obama balls in the Oval Office and you can‚Äôt wait to do the same thing for Biden if he wins.
Yes: I think his campaign manager has a lot of work to do to corral Trumps mouth &amp; thumbs &amp; do serious damage control.  Trump had us on our way, then C19 followed by BLM Riots.  Biden represents the riots, that would be our entire country if he got elected.  Scary thought!
I think he‚Äôs saving that if Biden gets elected.

Thank Biden for writing those laws!

Thank you for the Biden boost, Rudy.  TRUMPS NUMBERS ARE ABYSMAL.
This is a lie. You won  because of racism and hate. You appealed to the white, racists in America and the people who hated Hillary. It wasn‚Äôt a referendum on Obama/Biden. It was all about Hillary and racism. This year it is a referendum on you. We hate you and will vote you out.they already have the results translated before they gave them to their candidate Biden.
"Thank you for the money, can I have more? I don't know how long I can prop up the Biden campaign and harm American people, I think they are catching on"  something like that.

Ignore all the polls that show Biden leading. Don‚Äôt relax. Everyone needs to get out and vote in November.
Just a coincidence. Had nothing to do with hedging their bet for Biden.
The Democrat party only cares about their invested interests.  That includes companies that are in foreign nations.  The Joe Biden campaign is a prime example of that.  When Joe Biden spoke about Americans being forced to switch to things like solar energy.
That's because these terrorist organizations that are attempting an insurrection against the United States of America. Are fully funded by George Soros.  George Soros is also a large contributor to Democrat campaigns.   That's why Joe Biden will not release a list of contributors
Biden might be your choice, but honestly he's not improving. If I could vote for a more competent President this election cycle I would. But Trump is all this country has. Without him we will be fed to the wolves. just to make an example of us for 2016. God bless. Stay safe.
That's also why Joe Biden refuses to release a list of large donors to his campaign.

You can't point to Portland while ignoring Standing Rock. Point out the bullshit on both sides. Biden has no problem letting Indigenous people in America be brutalized by mercenaries. That's not any better than what is happening in Portland. Be principled.
Biden has spent 40 years in office. That's more than enough time to make a difference. Investing 4 more years seems a little greedy and myopic not to mention just silly.
Rasmussen Reports today revealed that¬†Trump has edged up another point¬†as Biden hits a ceiling.
Biden has proven only that he is an empty husk. Old Joe, who was for police and working people and law and order, is long gone. His body is there but, like his party, it has been invaded by the socialist left.
Standing Rock happened on  Obama and Biden's watch. Granted he didn't order it but he didn't  do a god damn thing to stop it either.

Biden pledges to bring in Jihadist from all over the world! While weakening if not abolishing the police? Biden will give America away to a "systemic fundamental change" of the country: more domestic terrorism until it becomes a Communist or Islamic country or both, though split.
At least he stood his ground on not abolishing the police like the Minneapolis mayor, BUT just imagine Biden in his place! The mob will do anything with him! Though he hasn't come out on abolishing the police, I can't imagine him standing up to the mob! He'll blabber his way out!
Soon as Obama won his second election, gop went full bore on Hillary for the next 4 years. Had the dems been smart, they would have pulled the rug out from them and switched to Biden then last second. Ifs and buts. Ifs and buts

Just being competitive enough to force the trump campaign to waste resources defending is a victory of its own. I‚Äôm convincing as many former republicans and politically indifferent to participate, and vote for Biden. Should be within single digits barring an October surprise.
It‚Äôs growing, for sure. I‚Äôve been seeing people with Biden masks, bumper stickers, hats, and shirts, as well as a bunch of yard signs, and this is the last republican stronghold in the state (Fort Worth/Tarrant County)

Your a joke Biden
Papa Biden and son alot of fishy business in foreign countries mmmmmmm
I'm voting for Joe Biden no matter who he picks as VP, to be clear. I think who he chooses for VP matters more to people who are either far to his left, or reluctant republicans. Depending on which one of these groups has a bigger issue turning out, the choice has consequences.
Hard no on Rice.  Harris is the safest choice and you don't gamble when you've got a big lead. Slow and steady has served Biden well so far. It's not time to take chances.
If Biden doesn‚Äôt pick  I‚Äôm voting for trump!!!!

That‚Äôs true too. It would be a way out for them. It would be smart, but I think they‚Äôre more likely to blame Biden for everything that happened this year and lie their way out of it. Their base will believe it. They did in 2008.
Whatever!  Biden is a pig!
What are the odds Joe Biden actually tweeted this
Wow, choosing a Lady VP is tough. Maybe Biden should just choose a dude. (Sarcasm).
So if not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, and not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden, then by that logic, people that vote third party or don‚Äôt vote at all are voting for.... both of them?
Biden didn't need ground support.The Democratic Party elected Biden, not voters.They got everyone else out of the race.Bernie willingly left the fight,just like last time. They elected a dementia patient,and don't care.They're capable of doing anything to defeat Trump. Anything.
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election

Regardless, you can‚Äôt point to me enough states that Biden will flip you blue in order to win the election.
Obama:one of histories most vile con men, and the fact that he is so revered by libs demonstrates the hopelessness of a Biden presidency and essentially dooms the US to more of the same .... if Biden wins, hence a worsening of a failed state.
didn‚Äôt sponsor the bill (let‚Äôs assume he did) and the  Clinton, Obama, etc have derided the law as MAJOR failure that targeted minorities (a shitty job at best) - trying to put Biden as wise on the topic is equal to say Trump is the brightest man in earth.
Biden might not even make it to November.  His handlers are having a difficult time keeping him focused and on topic.  It‚Äôs sad what the Democratic Party is doing.  Biden will get destroyed!  Would love to see Joe mumble through his thoughts in a debate!  He is a chicken sh*T
If Trump is going to not run for re-election, or switch Pence out for Hailey, this would be the time to do it.  Next week is when Biden is going to announce his Veep.  I would expect a Monday announcement if it‚Äôs something major.
It's really kind of sad.  The number of guffaws, mixups, erroneous numbers, etc just continues to grow.  Grandpa Joe needs just hang it up and go enjoy his retirement years and he certainly doesn't have the cognitive skills to be President.

Biden‚Äôs worse
My money is on DJT supporters any day.  Biden supporters are cupcakes....
Joe Biden is effectively shutting down that debate. He's not interested in single-payer at all. He's said so in so many words.  How the hell is calling him out on that "bad faith"? Your statements are more bad faith than Bri's.
Biden is a puppet...I‚Äôm amazed the left think hes the best candidate.   Riding BHO‚Äôs wave of failed policies.  Can you outlaw the Dem‚Äôs in your second term please?  The time has come for 2 pro-American parties to run.  Thanks for what you do..
The GOP is interfering.....they look greedy and out of touch.  Unemployment and GDP reduction....they are trying to cut the fed money by 2/3 with the belief everyone will just go back to work.  No jobs to go to Jeb...GOP needs to step up or insert Biden, spells disaster.
That wasn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs making but let‚Äôs agree that he was involved &amp; the Bill has been derided by  as a terrible law against minorities - that gets Biden an F- in my book
Find one single law developed and passed by Biden in his 30+ years parasitic Policial life in favor of the police ... it‚Äôs easy to judge Biden for what he did/didn‚Äôt 3 years ago BUT his legacy is beyond the past administration

I came home and, before I got to the front door, I stepped on a gooey mess that smelled awful. I looked down, and it was Devin Nunez.
It seems to me, Kimberly, that that decision will be made long before Biden is sworn in
I was half-expecting to see Joe Biden pop up from behind the casket and throw BIDEN t-shirts into the crowd.
I dont know for sure but say hes impeached and removed tommorrow. I dont think thats an automatic win for biden, either pence or someone else runs in his place. Im not an expert though
Lots of reasons, but the main one is that you can‚Äôt tell me that Biden is going to win over the states that Hillary couldn‚Äôt that would get him to 270.

No sane person would vote for Biden
Hate to break it to you but.....he didn't have the majority in 2016 and people like Biden better! Where is her going to manufacture these votes? Should we worry about fraud from his side? Is that why he is so worried about it? Unreal 500 million votes cast! Lol
if it only reveals that certain officials engaged in an attempt to weaken the president and drive a bogus investigation forward, it would condemn Democrats who have defended the Mueller investigation, including Joe Biden.
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for Biden and hate speech on Trump
Sounds like Biden‚Äôs got it in the bag then. Nothing to worry about right? I sincerely hope that EVERY citizen gets out there and votes.
That would be a slap in the face to every black person that backed Biden.
PELOSI:  COME TO CHINATOWN!  EAT, DRINK AND SHOP!  IT'S SAFE! BIDEN:  THE PRES IS XENOPHOBIC!  HE WON'T LET THE CHINESE FLY HERE!  Who should pay?
Joe Biden is 77... In the mortality rate of males 75 to 79 is 4,193 per 100,000 (80 to 84 is 6,901)  So there is greater than a 4.1% chance of him dying each year he is in office.  So about an 18% chance that he just dies in office of natural causes.  They just need to be ready.
He lost track of being at a funeral, thought he was at a Rally for him and Joe Biden!!!!
I'm doing the same. My desire to see Trump ousted outweighs my desire to not vote for Biden.
Watched some, I don't know about Biden, Pelosi did!
I believe that in the 2024 election, Harris should be on the ballot.  Not 2020.  Harris dropped out earlier than many because she did not have the support.  Biden needs someone who will bring support (other than Bernie Sanders).
He and his GOP has done so much damage that it will take Biden and his congress and senators at least a year to undo the damage.
Biden, Pelosi and the Democrats could possibly seal victory just by saying "We will repeal the 2006 PAEA and restore stability to the US Postal Service."  Why won't they?
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for lying Biden. Surprised the family let him do this. Shame on them
Not a Biden fan either, my remark was not partisan. Weak candidates on both sides.
What???? Obama was not President in January nor was Biden Vice President. What are you talking about??!
Campaign speech for Lying Biden. Was no funeral.  All a put on

You really screwed up endorsing Biden over Bernie. I guess the offer of a cabinet position was too good to pass up. I'd say something about it being on your conscience, but now that you're a stereotype politician, you probably don't have one.

Vote for who ever you want. Just remember that if you want Trump out of office that a vote for anyone other then Biden is a vote in Trumps favor. The Democratic party can not afford to split our vote. We know the Republican party won't be writing in celebrities.
Yes, Trump *could* lose, and Democrats *could* retake the Senate. But it ain't over till it's over.  Backing Biden right now makes me feel like "Weekend at Bernie's."
I get calls and texts but when I say I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, they disengage.
The only way our freedom will be gone is if Biden gets in the White House!!!
Well you‚Äôve had 40 years to study Biden , shouldn‚Äôt be to hard to find something
Yes, because we libs believe in basic human decency.   Now ask the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù if they‚Äôd help an elderly person wearing a Joe Biden T-shirt.
It only appears that way because Biden has dropped out without a comment!!!!  Worry about keeping your citizens happy, I hear they're not!!!!   What did you do to them?????
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.

Within this WaPo opinion peice, it reads, ‚ÄúNonetheless, Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason.‚Äù Is it still treasonous when Trump himself suggests delaying the election,
Biden watching Trump collapse, but then realizing what he will probably inherit.
So it turns out Biden's accusation wasn't unfounded at all
Removing necessary money will result in Biden and his cronies winning in Nov.  Get the jobs back and then cut the unemployment....i promise i make more than the enhanced umemployment.  Need a place to go back to.  Like 30 million more people.  32.9% decrease GDP.
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
I support Biden. He‚Äôs not a traitor. Go foam at the mouth somewhere else.
Big relief to me if Joe Biden says, "Kamala Harris" soon.
Remember   and  defend every fraudulent statement  .  What will they say to President Pelosi and or President Biden when she or he takes office?
Donald Trump threatens to DELAY US presidential election in worrying Twitter rant
True! BIDEN HAS NO SHOT!  Will the Libs promise to not loot and riot when Trump wins!?
As of today, this column has officially not aged well.
It is clearly unfounded, over the line, and outrageous to suggest such a thing, basically accusing Trump of treason! At least according to one conservative writer.
The sinking feeling in my stomach is that this transformation to fascism in the US is inevitable. Seeing unmarked/unidentifiable men ‚Äújust doing their job‚Äù &amp; a large % of the pop being incredibly racist &amp; brainwashed by extreme right wing propaganda. I dont think Biden is a fix.
Here we go again.  Kamala now Rice.
If you're not in love with Biden I get it. This is, however, less about who we put in and more about who we take out of office. We know Republicans won't be writing in Blake Shelton, Mel Gibson, or Ted Cruz. We as Democrats can't afford to split our vote.
Put on the mask and increase the polling hours.   But i wouldnt care if it was delayed.  I‚Äôm concerned about the economy.  If it takes Biden has a chance.  You sent the market into a free fall with this post.
Jim Jordan was fucking unhinged, per usual. Told Google CEO Pichai that he was "rigging the election for Biden."  Jordan, your narrative is wrong. Move that question to Zuck. Most of AdWords is lifestyle brands. Address the other monitor, dogg.

O yes can you imagine If it was someone with a Biden hat. Omg
O yes. They would love everybody to wear a Biden hat.  This is Cuba , Venezuela. Do wht they say or you‚Äôll pay
Put on a mask ....mail in voting means Biden gets elected.  If we can go to the grocery store we can go to the polls.  Extend the hours to encompass the entire 24 hr period.
I challenge you to a zoom call town hall. No teleprompter, no ear piece, just you and me and whomever wants to listen. Stop hidin Biden. You're old and senile and can't face the American public.  It's OK, let's just let  handle it!! #Trump2020Landslide

I would argue that the reason Trumps messaging on Covid -19 has become more serious lately is NOT because of the Biden polls.  I would argue that he is really just  setting the stage for an election to be too dangerous for the public to actually participate in.
I would like to hear their classification of "violent protesters."  And then laugh,  remembering an umbrella wielding man in Minneapolis was recently arrested for arson.  A white supremacist.  Believed to be purposefully agravating tensions.

Governor, while we are on the subject of Biden's Black woman selection as VP, I expect a White female voter backlash as a result. As a Pres. contender, his decision should never have been based on race but who was the best qualified. But women should be considered not by race.

Did you know that Biden is beating you in three red states that you won in 2016?  And not by a small margin, either.  He's beating you by a lot. I'm thinking it has something to do with the over 149,000 American citizens you have killed, but I could be wrong. #VoteBlue2020

He has a right to his opinion. But, has he looked at the other guy?  Biden is not perfect; no candidate is/was, but he's a criminal, madman.
That's not true. He won the most votes for "Most Fucked Up Person Ever". He won in a landslide. Obama and Biden didn't receive a single vote.
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
Truthfully Mr. President, I don't think Obama had any option to come forward because Biden could become a loose cannon and implicate him and others in the scheme to bring you down.I mean everyone is doing everything for their advantage. I mean this election sucks. Tbh I'd rather have Trump than Biden. Theyre both the worst. I'm libertarian so I mean its a lose lose for me so I mean i still will vote libertarian cuz i vote my morals.
And now look at all those dumb fuck reporters lmao. Biden was right.
A while because they haven't said if it stays in your system dormant, basically they're saying that it spreads sort of easy and it changes and that it's year round. I'm sure everybody wants to know more of it, as much as possible. I bet Biden will put his foot down.

Yea, but it's a great photo op for his followers to lap up and somehow blame on Obama.  Or Biden.  Not sure how that works.
Oh, I'm sorry. That kid was pushed to go back to school too soon and died. And by the way, we haven't seen a "Biden America" yet.   When that picture was taken Donald Trump had been president for YEARS...and still was. Welcome to TRUMP'S AMERICA on the right side (of course)
Funny that you advocate so strongly for dem socialism but are for Biden. I understand needing a stepping stone but fucking Christ, you picked the worst one
What cure are you talking about? And if I remember correctly, Trump is the coward that ran into the bunker and shut off the White House lights when things got spicy. Weird to call Biden a coward when your sitting president is scared of his own American people
Black, Asian, Latino, LGBT, Woman, Man; as long as they don‚Äôt forget what the position is about: the people. We have to change the character of people holding office- no more rapists or pedophiles in office, no Trump, no Biden. Let‚Äôs demand more of people in office.
Because Biden just sees women as objects! He has no remorse for sexually assaulting  or touching little girls inappropriately. If you vote for Trump or Biden, you endorse that behavior.
Biden will only last one term so let's hope  is on place as VP to take over.

Listening to your music, I‚Äôd vote for trump just to stop that insult to music. Jk, I still wouldn‚Äôt vote for him or Biden.

Do you HAVE to vote for Biden? of course not. But you should be absolutely aware of the effect of that choice.   Not that progressives vote anyway.
I hope progressives understand that voting for anyone other than Biden is, in effect, a vote for Trump. Biden has already "committed" to policies that would make him the most progressive president ever. Is he Bernie or Yang? No. But do we really want to risk 3ish SCOTUS seats?

Well I would like to see these people that actually like him, anywhere I go I see people whining about Biden, it seems like people are voting for him ONLY because they dont want Trump to win again. How does it all come down to something ridiculous like that?
There were candidates in 2016 and this one that I wouldve given my vote to but they're out! But you are right, not enough people vote for the candidates with common sense. Tho, if nobody is thrilled about voting for Biden, how is he even a candidate??
I understand that but there were candidates in the beginning that had potential to me and they're all out. Even YOU say you're not thrilled with Biden but dont want Trump to win, many people are saying this. Nobody is happy about the selection we have, that's the problem. Why??
You absolutely 100% did the right thing. President Biden shouter matter straight next year with you.

And you also missed the theme of my tweet. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he thinks will be the best partner whether black or non-black. No one can coerced him to pick any woman. I only wish he picks a qualified black woman....my personal wish.
Lol....Who am I to rewrite history. Endorsing immediately or the attack on the debate stage has no bearing on who Joe Biden picks. He will pick whoever he feels will be the best partner for him. I just wish he picks a qualified black woman. Period!!! That's my personal wish.
Nothing personal. All these tweeter talks won't determine who JB picks. He will pick the best person for himself....my statement about picking a qualified black woman is my personal view that has no effect on who Joe Biden picks.
I am not campaigning for anyone but I wish Joe Biden picks one of the qualified black women. The onus lies on Joe Biden to pick whoever he wants but in my opinion EW will be the worst pair for JB because they are not "simpatico" at all. I love EW...she is qualified to be POTUS
You don't need to be confused because it is a straightforward message. Let me state it again...No matter who Joe Biden picks (whether white or non-white), people(whether blacks or non-blacks)will still vote for him but there will be certain blacks that will feel betrayed
I never threatening not to vote for Joe Biden....FYI Joe Biden was my number one candidate during primary....I was sad when he wasn't performing well in the first three primary/caucus. I love Kamala Harris but if JB feels she is not the right person for him so be it. There are

A two party system is stupid asf. Both sides are pedophiles and neither side really give a fuck. Atleast the unemployment rates for minority communities has fallen drastically under trump. That‚Äôs really the only thing that gives him a leg up on Biden
Also if you support Biden you support the cabal. Both candidates are pedophiles and both are shitty people. Obamacare ducked up a lot of minorities lives. Which was put into place when Biden was vp. If you want the NWO to take over then vote for Biden

I wish Michelle Obama would take the place as vice president with Joe Biden!!!
Well done, Damani!! Keep hitting them with the facts.   I‚ÄôM embarrassed that the fellow Texan is stupid enough to vote personality over policy AND thinks Biden is a decent man.
I am a lifelong Democrat, cried with joy when Obama won (twice!) and cried with sadness when Hillary lost. Now I cry with rage as Democrats defend what our country is witnessing in Portland and Seattle. Biden needs to stand up to these thugs and denounce them!
Well it's either him or a man that has 24 rape allugations, was pals with Jeffery, and openly sexualizes his own daughter.  Yelp, I'm going with Biden.
I'm hearing friends who are life-long Democrats say they are appalled by what is happening in Portland and Seattle and will not be voting for Biden or any other Democrat. It warms my soul.
Biden plays T-ball, under the supervision of his DNC babysitters‚úîÔ∏è
He's good at this because he has the right experience and expertise to lead this nation out of the giant hole Donald Trump and his ilk have dug for us. We are sinking fast and need Joe Biden now more than ever.
Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden - The Washington Post
Republicans already put into place Opportunity Zones that led to record unemployment for Black and Brown communities. Biden not offering anything new, he‚Äôs just pandering for votes using Trump‚Äôs ideas
Biden: we need the Asian vote... lackey: KH has 1164th Korean.  Biden: Fix her eyes feed her garlic and puppies.
I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
One of us will be right on Nov 4th and one of us will be sad. I like my chances of a Biden Presidency and a Dem controlled House and Senate so we will see.
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
Well he did lose by 1.5million votes so the polls where correct. They also correctly predicted 2018 and Dems actually outpformed what polls suggested so taking 2018 into account, I'm very optimistic Biden will be President.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Seems degrading no? Like Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù

‚ÄúJoe Biden, he‚Äôs lucky someone doesn‚Äôt kick his ass‚Äù -
It depends. I moved to TX from AZ and typically vote on the individual and their stance on ideals that are important to me. Party does not necessarily matter, character does. Hence my future vote for Biden.
Historically the VP has been a do nothing job. But George W and Obama both had more from the VP. Of course Cheney was more active in a negative way. Biden and Obama was more of a shared role. Having said that I think Biden‚Äôs choice will be more than a do nothing VP.
They actually do.... Biden is beyond flawed but trump is worse
Good point. Biden is my pick. But I can‚Äôt help thinking he will not live thru 4 years. I hope I am wrong. But it‚Äôs a thought I‚Äôm sure many of us are thinking, but are afraid to say. Nevertheless, anyone he picks would still be much better than the current alternative.
I‚Äôm not picky. Either would be an advantage. I actually think Val Demings might be a better pick. Primarily because she represents Florida which might help the ticket. But personally I will vote Biden regardless of his VP pick.

if by any chance some of his supporters get twisted due to VP Biden not choosing their choice as VP, Trump wins big time, no doubt. I don't know about yall, but the USA giving trump another 4 yrs probably wipe the USA off the earth, that's how I feel at this time.
I don't care who serves as his VP, I'll be voting for Biden, even if I have to walk 30 to 40 miles to the nearest polling station to do so. I just hope his supporters don't get their shorts twisted in a fking bunch due to the fact VP Biden didn't  select their candidate.
As VP Biden prepare to announce his VP, I advises his supporters to stay focus on the goal of making Trump a one term President. Granted, VP Biden may/may not select my choice or your choice to serve as his VP, yet, we shouldn't get bent out of shape if he picks someone else.

He‚Äôs right. Vote Biden!
Get out!!! Texas is going BLUE FOR BIDEN!!!!
, I didn‚Äôt see when You had set up an interview with Biden. Biden said we are working on Census at least 2 years ahead of 2020. He also asked where he was. Do You think it valid to ask for a Biden competency test since foreign and Domestic policy would change left.
I would really like to see your proof Murry, Biden has enough proof of racism, and for you dreams of going blue in Texas, keep on dreaming. I do not mind a conservative Democrat, however your socialism FAR left minds need to be put to bed.

if biden loses, the centrists will do nothing but blame bernie supporters for not liking their guy. when they fail to realize not voting for either terrible candidate is just that, a vote for the green party.
I got friends who graduated college who ain't smart enough to see they being used by the democratic party not even after Biden said "you ain't black unless you vote for me" smart ones
Your head may explode during Biden's concession speech on Nov. 5th.

With fewer than 100 days until the presidential election, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has announced he will choose his running mate next week.
Every vote for a Democrat is vote for taxpayer funded abortion up until the point of birth. I‚Äôm proudly pro-life. In Congress, I‚Äôll FIGHT the anti-life Democratic Party and I‚Äôll FIGHT for the rights of the unborn.
I agree most polling has shown protests aren't helping DT as much as people think it may so far.Biden has been doing better than HRC at this point and people have had 4 years of DT.Look at things like the bounties and all he is saying regarding Putin/Russia/COVID and the reaction
The poll, conducted by Morning Consult Political Intelligence, says Trump's lead over Biden in must-win states--like Texas--has evaporated.
OMG, Biden just said he would use the local police in the case of controlling rioters...where has he been, the local police have been told to stand down... go back to your basement Joe.
Joe Biden just said over 340 million people have watched his ‚Äúbasement time‚Äù really?  I haven‚Äôt watched you...what a whopper!
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  I agree with President Trump, Lewis was just another Crooked Marxist Career Democrat!!!
I wouldn‚Äôt trust Biden to operate a vehicle
The article linked above your post supplies data supporting Biden's claim.  You provide only a claim that there is no wage gap.  What is your source, please?
To be fair tho ........ a lead pedophile and Satan worshiper is in charge of twitter so it‚Äôs not really a loss when U have trump boat rallies vs. Biden who doesn‚Äôt even have people buying stickers
yes. but the dems best strategy is to not let biden talk because he‚Äôs as incoherent as trump much of the time.
Seems like liberals only want separation of Church &amp; State when it‚Äôs Christianity. Wonder why that is?
, Since Joe Biden wont interview with Wallace. Maybe Chris ought to do a story on WHY Not?  And show Biden gaffes and talk about his Dementia. He may have to provide interviews and competency testing. Media has dropped the ball. Can Republicans nix interviews.

Former President Barack Obama joined former Vice President Joe Biden for a socially-distanced conversation in a campaign video released Thursday.
You seem to misunderstand, Joe Biden is a democrat.
Fake conservative  (who once vetoed pro-life &amp; pro-gun bills as governor) is desperate for attention. Never-Trump ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äù are strictly in it for themselves, and they can NEVER be trusted.
Only the brain dead could vote for Biden
There‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äúvoter registration physician‚Äù but most physicians would agree with this:  desperately needs to get his head examined.
Bet YOU Biden can ad would be a good bit more cogent and coherent than DT ever is Nikki and u just are amazing me
This is happening in democratic run cities. Biden supports these violent riots. Trump does not support these riots and in fact has taken action to protect the citizens of the cities where these violent riots are occurring.
These violent riots are occurring in democratic run cities. Biden has supported these riots. Trump is against the riots and has taken action to protect the citizens of the city from the violence occurring in these riots.
Wrong! these riots are happening in democratic run cities. Biden has verbally supported the riots. Trump is against the riots and has taken action to stop the riots from happening and protect the citizens of the city.
This is happening in democratic run cities and is supported by Biden. Trump has taken action to stop these violent riots from happening and has only gotten push back from the democratic mayors of the cities.
This is taking place in democratic run cities Biden has verbally aupported it Trump has not.  if you can‚Äôt see the difference then you are the problem.
It‚Äôs taken from cities governed by Democrats and Biden supports it Trump does not. that‚Äôs why it is Biden‚Äôs America the Democrats America.
Joe Biden accused Mitt Romney of wanting to put black people back in chains, but no, the real uncivilized behavior is because Yoho used the hurty words.  I'm so sick of ya'lls double standard.

A vote for Biden is a vote to silence Hollywoods little secret
Biden is not going to do anything for us but he will shut the hell up, so I guess that‚Äôs a plus.   I just need a campaign sign big enough to fit that slogan on.
Biden is the more conservative candidate.
We have witnessed VP Biden in office. We have witnessed you in office. It‚Äôs not difficult to decide under which administration that we moms felt safer. Not difficult at all. #JoeBiden2020
Why are you concerned then, if President Obama &amp; Vice President Biden ‚Äúdid a terrible job ‚Äú?  It‚Äôs probably because they had an incredible 8 years &amp; handed you a robust economy (that you tanked). We are coming for you Donald &amp; will vote you out in Nov!!
, Biden is the first Democrat with Dementia to run for President and the first one not to be interviewed by the Press in a serious way.  Basically  Not fact checked.
...(8)...that a few mins at a time. Trump was having unscripted interviews lasting 2-3 hours every day. Pres Trump is not a saint. But he‚Äôs done more for this country, for every race in this melting pot we call USA, in his first 3 years than Obama/Biden did in 8.
...(6)...and babies in their beds. Obama &amp; Biden were in office for 8 years and did nothing to improve the violence in cities like Chicago. Biden has been in politics for almost 50 years yet NOW he claims he can bring the country together. Even without his gaffs and out &amp; out...
and voting for in this instance as many voting for Biden but everyone who isn't voting  for DT  is a good vote,and don't really see how anyone can validate it as a believer/christian or if beliefs/values/principles matter to u
...(2)...unstable and yet day after day Biden has gaff upon gaff. If he were my husband/dad/granddad I would not allow him to continue to embarrass himself like this. Who does the left REALLY want in that presidential office? The left claims Biden is the one because he can be...
A vote for Biden is a vote against America. You're either incredibly unperceptive or a liar. Are you frickin crying. You embarrass yourself and all vets. You should have been more careful closing those hatches. MAGA 2020
Ohh I agree  and that Biden has more places to play and  open fronts on than DT does is something and his territory is expanding.
"2020 Election Live Updates: Why a Trump Tactic vs. Biden May Not Work in the Coronavirus Era" by Unknown Author via NYTYou‚Äôre sorely mistaken my friend. Biden supporters have openly defended Clinton.
Why would his campaign pay for anything? We taxpayers are paying for his campaign speeches every day when he steps up for a ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù briefing. We pay when he steps out of Air Force One and talks about how bad off we will be if Biden is elected.

Man, I‚Äôm not even a republican and I see that overarching BLM is just a logo, used to make money for the DNC candidates. None of that money went to a black community. Even though Biden says he is. And America and the GOP isn‚Äôt fascist. Read a book about fascism. I assure you.
Pretty damn sure when a Nancy pelosi's relatives wrote that.. I know damn well Joe Biden can't spell prostitute . Lmao
I really do not care if he doesn‚Äôt accept the results. At noon Jan 20 Biden is the president and trump can whine for the rest of his life. Nothing out of the ordinary is going to happen. He did same in 2016. He didn‚Äôt think he would win then.

Hey SWALWELL JOE BIDEN MADE THE DEFINITE STATEMENT HE WAS GOING TO PLACE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS THROUGH EVERY SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD. WHAT PART OF THAT DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND? WHO IN THE HELL WANTS A BUNCH OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BRINGING YOUR PROPERTY VALUE DOWN. A DEMOCRAT THAT'S WHO!

You're crazy. Most of us wouldn't vote for Biden if he were the only candidate.
Do you know where you today Biden?  Do you remember what office you‚Äôre running for? Who is doing your tweets today? Are you even awake or napping?
What's gonna happen when Biden Doesn't win ? Be 4 Years after that to be released to Us You Fucking Pussies...
Did you see Biden today?  He came out and said hello to the wrong town, and then he said he was joking, and he said some gibberish, and then he.........
Remember, it's not Biden who is selecting his running late. It's the deep state, ie unions who control him who's doing the selecting. Biden is the yes man. I have a sneaky suspicion Bidens meeting with Obama was about this.
Soooo we should only believe the doctors that say what Democrats are pushing. Everyone has their own agenda like democrats keeping senile Biden out of debates, keeping hateand fear going to try to win an election and start socialism. I guess we should just flow with that too huh
These polls either show A.) the polls we are being shown on TV are bullshit and nobody is voting Biden, B.) A great social experiment showing us we follow likeminded people or C.) We‚Äôre finally gonna have a Libertarian President.
Got a new name for the candidate who no one really knows (because he keeps changing like a chameleon) Here's Judge Jeanine on "Hidin' Biden." But you'll never hear it on the MM. PS- that's a new one.. we all say running for, but 'hiding' for Presidency?
As l‚Äôm watching replay on cspan of the Barr hearing, there‚Äôs NO amount of money the Trump campaign could have spent that would‚Äôve showed the country the evil intentions of the democrats! If l was a democrat, l would hide with Biden! Demon possession is real folks!!
As far as they‚Äôre concerned Biden is more of a woman than any woman could be. He‚Äôs blacker than anyone, whiter than anyone...  He‚Äôs everything anybody could want. They put some hardcore shrooms in that Kool-Aid.
You don't need a brain scan of #Biden to know something is wrong with him!  All he does is babble!!!
Newsflash--Obama/Biden is not a choice in this thread. He was not talking about them.  Also news--I am not a Trump supporter, but I'm scared to death that Biden might win and he's even worse.  More corruption to continue the existing corruption.

Only reason I‚Äôd vote trump (be the first time in ages I went to an establishment party), would be because Biden is a puppet and the puppeteers on the left scare the shit out of me.

The majority, or say 100% of black people I know in person don‚Äôt want anything to do with BLM. We were already enjoying each others company happily. Then these BLM folks come in and try to resurrect segregation. Biden has a history of supporting segregationists. Am I right?
I think the Democrats will tire of the riots and protest going on, will throw Biden under the bus at the convention, elect Hillary to run against Trump again. She will move back toward the center. Any way you slice it, Hillary will be the Democrat nominee for President.
Your followers?  If you ever see me disappear it‚Äôs because twitter or the cabal did it. Or Biden jacked my shit.
Tomorrow when we hear about the strongest wind in history, ‚Äúthey‚Äù said it was tremendous wind. Nothing could stand against it ‚Äúthey‚Äù said.  Ask why all of the men are just standing in the field holding their hats.
I still this Biden running for President is a sham and and a setup for Hillary Clinton. She looks and talks too comfortable. I think she swings her party back toward the center, but still far left. She wont debate Trump. She will make wild promises she can't keep.

The minute Biden is sworn in nobody will listen to trump. So tired of this story.
Could Biden have known China was going to infect the world with covid 19 before they actually did? The street violence broke out shortly after. Coincidence? Could China and this hijacked Democrat party be working together to destroy America. Biden knows something. My opinion only
You can bank on it. The Democrats are planning on stealing this election, not from just Trump, but from every local, state, and Federal contested race. The Democrats must know they have this in the bag or Biden wouldn't be there.
Potus did the China travel ban on January 31 and Biden and Pelosi called it xenophobic and racist. How many more would have died on their watch? I‚Äôll wait.
That sounds like a needed reform of the police.  Biden won't say "De-fund" but he'll for sure say "reformS" are needed - just like that one

I don‚Äôt see Biden caring anymore than Trump does. For people at that level winning is simply about gaining the power to push your agenda. You and I care about average people because that‚Äôs what we are. If you ever hit it big, don‚Äôt ever forget you were one of us.
So show me where I said joe Biden wants to oust religion?  You can‚Äôt, because I didn‚Äôt say it.
I see a lot of republicans that say they‚Äôre voting Biden because Trump doesn‚Äôt support their Christian or conservative values. I want to ask those people a question, why did you not take part in the primaries?  There were other candidates.  Bill Weld etc. genuinely want to know
I guess follow Hilary and Obama‚Äôs playbook. Start spying on Biden campaign. Claim Biden colluded with China and open a special council.
Trump is not going to lose. Use simple logic and what you see in your everyday life. Nothing indicates a Biden win.
No just gives more people a reason not to look for jobs increasing the likelihood of our market getting destroyed over a long period of time not to mention after Biden wins its game over for stock market growth for a while especially the Dow Jones

Just a wild hunch on my part, but if Ghislaine Maxwell is in danger for what she knows and can tell, wouldn't Biden be in the same predictament? Add to that his growing senility and the growing investigations against him and Hunter and I can see a growing liability to Obama.
Isn't it amazing how the day after Biden drew a whopping 19 people to his virtual town hall, he has a photo op/ sit-down with Obama. I would think he either got the riot act read to him, or told to get out of the race. It is very clear to me who's running the Democrat Party now.
I can‚Äôt imagine supporting a party that nominates Joe Biden as the best you got! WOW!
Yes, right.  Biden went out and met with and talked to Protesters on the ground. Stood with them and called for new reforms etc. He listened to them and responded.  Trump hid in his bunker and has been in total offensive and/or Reaction mode. No appropriate response at allIrony. A Biden supporter couldn‚Äôt beat up Jerry Nadler.

He wasn‚Äôt involved. I know you lefties are hoping n wishing, but the reality is Trump is the one trying to stop sex trafficking, not Obama, and certainly not the Clintons. Biden OWNS the island 10 miles away from Epstein. Ghislane owns submarines. It‚Äôs coming out soon...

Follow the events.  This shutdown keeps Biden out of the news and ALL of the pressure on Trump from a virus that was planned to be released during this election year!  Not a coincidence!  BLM only comes out suring election years.  Remember 2016? Where have they been since?
30% of the total population did not vote. In 2020, Biden can get more than 5 million more votes and still lose. Hillary got 3 million and lost. This is not a democracy.
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.

I think Biden doesn‚Äôt have to worry about anything.  The people will rise up.  Only 33% of Americans voted for Donald Trump last election and I predict that goes down to 29%.  That means 2/3rd‚Äôs of this country will rise up.  You can count on that!

A two party system is stupid asf. Both sides are pedophiles and neither side really give a fuck. Atleast the unemployment rates for minority communities has fallen drastically under trump. That‚Äôs really the only thing that gives him a leg up on Biden
Also if you support Biden you support the cabal. Both candidates are pedophiles and both are shitty people. Obamacare ducked up a lot of minorities lives. Which was put into place when Biden was vp. If you want the NWO to take over then vote for Biden

Well done, Damani!! Keep hitting them with the facts.   I‚ÄôM embarrassed that the fellow Texan is stupid enough to vote personality over policy AND thinks Biden is a decent man.
I am a lifelong Democrat, cried with joy when Obama won (twice!) and cried with sadness when Hillary lost. Now I cry with rage as Democrats defend what our country is witnessing in Portland and Seattle. Biden needs to stand up to these thugs and denounce them!
Well it's either him or a man that has 24 rape allugations, was pals with Jeffery, and openly sexualizes his own daughter.  Yelp, I'm going with Biden.
‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Joe Biden, and idiots will vote for me.‚Äù

Opinion | Now we know why Trump sought foreign help to beat Biden - The Washington Post
I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
Seriously?!?! CNN lies ALL day long! Biden‚Äôs camp puts out lies! When will their accounts be suspended?
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
Biden doesn‚Äôt speak in complete, coherent sentences ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but you think he would make a good president?!?
One of us will be right on Nov 4th and one of us will be sad. I like my chances of a Biden Presidency and a Dem controlled House and Senate so we will see.
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
Well he did lose by 1.5million votes so the polls where correct. They also correctly predicted 2018 and Dems actually outpformed what polls suggested so taking 2018 into account, I'm very optimistic Biden will be President.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
Seems degrading no? Like Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúpoor kids are just as bright as white kids‚Äù

So true Dan that Biden if he wins will be President in name only! Biden can not even sit down with Chris Wallace (who hates Trump)to do an interview! What are Dems hiding about Biden? Can he even debate? America needs answers before election!!
Biden who? üòÇ
Wait and see...if Biden gets elected, all of a sudden, HCQ will become a ‚Äúwait it does work!‚Äù drug and Covid will be gone by February.
so so so right!! Nail on head! All for creating footage for Trumps agenda.   Let‚Äôs remember. This is all happening under his presidency. Boggles the mind DJT says this is what it will be like under Biden. When it‚Äôs like this under him now.
If Trump wins again, Covid will continue to last ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù, but if Biden wins, Covid will disappear around Feb 2021 right after Biden takes office.
It may be the people you're associating with. I'm in red TX and lots of Biden fans here.
Looks like they are trying to get in front of some new info about to come out about Biden. October surprise early this year?
Just as well.  doesn't belong anyplace where honor and courage are celebrated.
No, just losing you, apparently. We ‚Äúsuburban mothers‚Äù understand Biden‚Äôs proposals do not reflect capitulation to the far left. They speak to 70% of Americans if not for themselves, for others they are called to support.
Depends. It Trump wins, Covid continues...if Biden wins, *poof* it magically goes away and we‚Äôve found a cure around February if he takes office.
Texas could be in play, but not Michigan. Both Biden and Trump need to spend on a broad map this year. There's just so much uncertainty on which states will be close.

Historically the VP has been a do nothing job. But George W and Obama both had more from the VP. Of course Cheney was more active in a negative way. Biden and Obama was more of a shared role. Having said that I think Biden‚Äôs choice will be more than a do nothing VP.
They actually do.... Biden is beyond flawed but trump is worse
Good point. Biden is my pick. But I can‚Äôt help thinking he will not live thru 4 years. I hope I am wrong. But it‚Äôs a thought I‚Äôm sure many of us are thinking, but are afraid to say. Nevertheless, anyone he picks would still be much better than the current alternative.
I‚Äôm not picky. Either would be an advantage. I actually think Val Demings might be a better pick. Primarily because she represents Florida which might help the ticket. But personally I will vote Biden regardless of his VP pick.
Great economy ever until Fauci, Democratic politicians along with China unleashed virus on us to take America‚Äôs economy down! Fauci predict pandemic in 2016-17 under Trump‚Äôs administration! How? Why? So people can believe Dems bs that will get Biden elected!

Joe Biden, your ‚Äúnew path forward‚Äù for this country, is horrifying. Most of us want racial equality ALL of the time, not just when black voters are needed to win an election. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòlike‚Äô Donald Trump. But he KEEPS PROMISES, &amp; is our only chance‚úîÔ∏è
I‚Äôm no Fauci apologist. But, just as  was similarly criticized, I think the criticism isn‚Äôt valid. You can clearly see a water bottle in his lap, just like Cruz‚Äôs coffee cup. He is frequently tested.   Biden chides Trump for playing golf, but not Fauci for baseball?
Why do these people not realize Biden will only be a body in the White House. He will not be president he will be the puppet that Obama the clintons George Soros and all of the worst people will be running the country and he will have to take orders

There is no perfect candidate. She has had to work with the system she inherited. As VP she would be an excellent person to reform policing, esp with her social work background. Biden has a great final list. Would be delighted with any of them. #Biden2020
My advice is everyone voting for Biden vote in person! Most states have in person early voting for at least 3 weeks before Election Day! Plan to wait, wear and mask and socially distance! Trump has made it clear he will contest mail in ballots cast for Biden!
Seriously, I will be so much calmer when I never have to hear  voice ever, ever again. And I pray on inauguration day, he just takes a pass and leaves before Biden is sworn in. The less I see of him, the better.
He will and we will forgive him because it is bigger than Biden. The current occupant of the White House is an existential threat.

Most people aren't, also just so you know I don't watch CNN or like Biden, he's an old racist pedo who isn't fit to serve this country. Personally, I've met at least 18 racist republicans, and 0 racist dems. Personal experience means nothing in a discussion like this.
There's actually no US candidates that have a socialist platform. The US is a heavily right leaning country, compared to any other country, Biden would be considered right leaning and bernie even would be a moderate left.

Results are in: the majority of Americans aren't republican, Hillary got more votes but Trump only won because of the electoral college. Also there's no far left candidates, Bernie was one of the only moderate left ones, and Biden is right leaning

But that's how you thought, but that's not Biden... otherwise he wouldn't have done what he did in his past along with his sons.... He is a politician...and a failed one.

Ending the filibuster is crucial for progress in 2021 and beyond. Warren understood that. Now they need to get Biden et all to understand it.
Not going to lie. I‚Äôve never seen someone in my 52 years that I want to see lose as much as Trump. I hope it‚Äôs a biblical ass whipping. Is Joe Biden my choice? Nope. But Trump needs to go down in a historical manner to shut his ignorant fat mouth.

True, but Biden can't remember what was said 7 seconds ago
You need to take off the blinders and read what President Obama and Vice President Biden (soon to be President Biden) did with immigration. Stop watching Fox/fake news. Now, go away and worship 45 while he is still there.
Governor, while we are on the subject of Biden's Black woman selection as VP, I expect a White female voter backlash as a result. As a Pres. contender, his decision should never have been based on race but who was the best qualified. But women should be considered not by race.
President Biden I really believe that Karen Bass should be your VP. She has a wonderful spirit just like you
PRESIDENT BIDEN dont worry he is out of there we about to take America back and the house and Senate we sick of all of them dam dummies

He has a right to his opinion. But, has he looked at the other guy?  Biden is not perfect; no candidate is/was, but he's a criminal, madman.
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
Truthfully Mr. President, I don't think Obama had any option to come forward because Biden could become a loose cannon and implicate him and others in the scheme to bring you down.Joe Biden never said he would repeal the Second Amendment.
Biden should tell his buddies to cut the bullshit!
Biden is...anti-DNC?
People said that about Biden in the primaries. Then South Carolina happened. They voted for him over two black candidates because most black voters don't vote based simply on the race of the candidate. At least, nothing in the data shows that they do.

"U.K. Officials‚Äô New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by Mark Landler via NYT
I have no problem criticizing Biden myself. Personally, I think the Burisma stuff is a legit problem. Well, it *would* be if it hadn‚Äôt been for the ‚Äúperfect call.‚Äù Trump nulllifed the issue for Uncle Joe. POTUS is his own worst enemy.
I say pass a law. Call their bluff. Call it the Hunter Biden is corrupt Act for all I care. They won‚Äôt do it because the legislators themselves don‚Äôt want that gravy train to end.
But that‚Äôs under the Trump administration. Lindsey is a chameleon and has no problems with contradicting himself when the environment changes. He will probably get chummy with Biden again once Trump is out of the picture.
Bernie bros say Biden is ‚ÄúRepublican lite.‚Äù The term ‚Äúleftist‚Äù isn‚Äôt sticking to him, in part because he was attacked from the left for the whole of the primary season.
Biden is not sound at all
Any black person not on welfare and continuing to vote Democrat isn‚Äôt black remember. Biden said so.
Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
I‚Äôm confused. Do you and Eric think Joe Biden is an abducted child? Or did you confuse it with a Silver Alert? That would at least make sense. Haha he‚Äôs old. Is there an alert for narcissistic and corrupt millionaires?

Hey Biden! It‚Äôs going to be a cold day in hell!
Saw it. You don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm level of Biden when you read from the teleprompter. But I suppose it‚Äôs the only way to prevent you for sabotaging your own campaign.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.
This graphic implies that 270 gets reached at FL. But, by my math, if Biden wins PA &amp; WI and everything to the left of them, he's at 274, even without FL + NH. What am I missing?
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
I think the inelasticity in Florida has been due to the high number of retirees. And that cohort is uncharacteristically Biden leaning in the crosstabs, these days.
Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Tomi please Trump said the virus is a hoax  . Trump waited to long to to something about it . And the real ass kicker is he tries to make Fauci the scapegoat for his ignorance ,I‚Äôm sorry but get your complaints ready for Biden .thats my final thought
Don't ask that question homie... you know you only asked that because you feel guilty for getting paid by Biden and the Clinton/Obama administration
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
I will stand in line from dusk till dawn or however long it takes.  Nothing will stop me from casting my vote for Joe Biden #wewillvote #texasdem
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
Possibility 1; Biden is elected with Hillary Clinton as his V.P. and the Speaker of the House, Pelosi pushes the 25th amendment to rid the country of Biden and ...TA DA.. Hillary becomes President.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Absolutely not, idgaf if you win, Biden wins, or Mickey Mouse wins, get this shit over with

Wrong. Our POTUS words have propelled a societal willingness to act out on racists beliefs.  Hillary wouldn‚Äôt have gutted the Obama/Biden pandemic team and wouldn‚Äôt have ignored the January warning of the outbreak. We would‚Äôve been FAR better off at this point.
Biden probably has more differences with Warren but there‚Äôs enough common ground that it could work.
With all due respect to Joe Biden, this country is well past the point where unity is possible. Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi together couldn‚Äôt do that.   The best we can hope for is to avoid another Civil War.
If Biden wins FL &amp; PA (both east coast states) then it‚Äôs over before WI is done counting, unless Florida goes to hanging chad territory.

Dems didn‚Äôt even sue to overturn it. Jill Stein did, but even she didn‚Äôt have much support for that. My guess is that if Biden wins (no matter the margin) Trump will contest it.
Biden will fix it.
Trump just lost the only consistent polling advantage he had over Biden: analyst #SmartNews
What about Biden's four-part platform do you not like?
No, but I have the same concern. VP choice makes little difference in vote tally, but people are very invested. When announced, Biden can offset upset declaring cabinet picks. If not Warren, make her Fed Chair, Susan Rice becomes Secretary of State, etc.
Yeah... I think Biden would be doing this:
If Biden wins, DACA will be fully restored. If the Senate flips, there'll probably be a DREAM Act. Family separation ends, too. Biden isn't perfect on immigration issues, but he's nothing close to Trump.
That said, none if it will matter in this term. Some district court will issue a stay, and DHS will have to continue accepting applications until the case can be heard. If Biden wins, none of this matters. If Trump wins, he'll have years to destroy DACA &amp; will eventually succeed.
If you want your future destroyed just elect Biden!  He has radical plans that will ruin this country!
This can be reversed in January if Biden wins. Dreamers may not be able vote, but they sure can help register their citizen neighbors, friends and family!
Biden was picked because of his decades of experience in Congress.
Think about it, with everything stacking up like 08 but worse. If Sanders managed to fix it, theyre genius 4d chess motherfuckers. If he didn't,  progressive stances don't work so go establishment.  All we get at this point is what happens if biden got in the first time he ran.
Biden is an idiot, so no one cares!

You need to add Biden to your daily statement!!!
It's actually odd because Trump was for M4A but then you saw how corporate republicans (Koch brothers people) brain washed him. That's why Trump voters in the mid West are going to vote for Biden because he changed absolutely nothing.
Yet again, Biden is much better than the green party candidate this time around. How am I going to vote for a guy who supports internet censorship.

Progressives inherit the party mid-decade, due to the demographic time bomb. When it happens, the GOP plan is to have as many Trump judges in place as possible. It won't be Obama/Biden appointees that strike down progressive programs. It'll be the likes of Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh.
What I see hap'nin is this backfiring and going badly for trump, b/c a lot of those silly azz ppl will vote for kanye who wud've prolly voted for trump, and meanwhile, many more overly fed up ppl can't wait to vote for Biden ending with a much bigger turnout than HRC had

Refusing to debate gives Trump a free talking point and, frankly, would feed the smear over Biden's capacity. Of course he should do 3 debates, as is the norm. But he needs to insist on them being moderated by journalists and not pundits.
It's just like you said on Asians. There were maybe 10 Asians in the poll. That's just not a sample worth analyzing.   I do think the top line result is valid. Biden +3 is not far off from the polling average. This poll is fine. But the cross tabs? I wouldn't put stock in that.

I‚Äôm not a Democrat but will be voting for Biden. I hope he picks Harris or Rice. I know enough about them to trust them.

Uh, no! He's going to work on replacing that worthless Obamacare! Afterall, there hasn't been a single DemonRAT that's solved it to this day. Many have been in Congress for decades. What did Biden propose? Trump is there 3 1/2 years, but it's his fault. Foh

Anita, this tweet must have really affected you since you‚Äôve responded so much. I don‚Äôt understand why y‚Äôall are so obsessed with politics. It‚Äôs sad really. Trump &amp; Biden don‚Äôt care care about you. They‚Äôve thrown good friends under the bus. We‚Äôve seen it.
Trump stated that there would be bloodshed in every community if Biden is elected.  Trump tends to use scare tactics whenever possible.  More scare tactics, I am trembling!This president likes to blow a ton of  steam. A bunch of fluff.
Which isn‚Äôt to say that Biden isn‚Äôt those things. He very well might be. But to suggest that opposing providing ANY legitimacy to what has simply been a broken tool to our collective liberations is in any way an excercise in privilege is, quite frankly, stupid as fuck.
But Biden isn‚Äôt the president
You cannot make the claim that Biden is the vote for lesser of two evils or the best case scenario for *yet another* failed election cycle without also acknowledging WHY, perhaps, those who have been most failed by it aren‚Äôt particularly enthused about have to compromise. Again.
And to think that those who aren‚Äôt the most disillusioned by this are those who are incredibly marginalized under a Trump Presidency, who were also marginalized under an Obama presidency, and who will continue to be marginalized under a Biden presidency is incredibly naive.
And we have joe Biden. Yay. üôÑ it‚Äôs like eating a bowl of shit like  the queen said so eloquently
You are so right. 3 months later that is. Hindsight is 20-20. Thanks anyway Mr. Biden.
That is the dumbest idea I have seen in a while.  At least since the Democrats decided to nominate Biden.
But framing this argument around people who are wholly unaffected by who sits in the White House instead of the several dissenters who WOULD be directly affected by a Trump OR Biden presidency is intentionally disingenuous and misses the point completely.
If Biden steals it, ditto..
There are several cases you can make FOR voting for Biden that I think are legitimate cases. I mean, I DO plan to, reluctantly, vote for him despite my many moral objections to legitimizing the sham of electoral politics.
The insinuation that the people choosing to not cast a vote for Biden are simply petulant, whiny children who are upset that their preferred candidate (usually Bernie in this context) didn‚Äôt get the nom and are insulated and protected by their privilege, is incredibly reductive.

I do not believe he will. Biden doesn‚Äôt even know we have a state called Florida.
She got my vote, but for now she's right where she needs to be, as long as MA has a Republican governor. Biden will need every Democratic senator.
You're not allowed to criticize them either. Point out what a massive piece of shit Biden is and how his record shows he should never be let near power again and the libs will never stop calling you Russian or accusing you of being a Trump supporter.
Poor old Biden. I feel sorry for him. He got old, has dementia and is now being led by the nose by Democrats. He might as well be drugged. Even if he is a Democrat I just believe he is being abused. No one deserves to be used like that. He print thinks they will kill him.

We absolutely cannot have this lying, foul-mouth Rice woman becoming Biden's VP running mate. She would be a huge detriment to our country.  Do not pick her, Joe.
Don't listen to this hype. Biden will choose who he blieve is the best suited as his VP. It's his choice. Biden 2020
That‚Äôs a pretty broad stoke of the brush you painted half the country with, and almost as disparaging as Trump is. I disagree. Calling others names doesn‚Äôt help win Biden any Republican votes. #JustSaying #WeWillVote
If the GOP says it, it‚Äôs a lie.  Biden doesn‚Äôt want to defund the police now and didn‚Äôt while he was VP.  Congress aka purse strings were controlled by the GOP.  Lie, lie, lie
Gotcha. I still wonder if the ‚Äùgamble‚Äù is worth it though for Biden. His one weakness if we can call it that isn't he Hispanic vote.
This talk of 2024 needs to stop, Biden will make the choice as to if he runs again in 2024. If Kamala is our VP then we do not need to be advancing the claims others are making that Kamala just wants president in 2024. No she will run in 2028 if Biden decides to run again.
Warren and Duckworth are clearly the best choices for VP and they‚Äôre both getting ignored SMH this is how I‚Äôm gonna give my vote to Biden in November

Cuomo's incompetence is directly responsible for 1/3 of those.  If Trump was partying in Chinatown with Nancy or listened to Biden instead of shutting down travel, there would have been a LOT more.

Biden has a problem. Women vote and his "allies" are damaging his campaign because women can't be ambitious or something.

BIDEN will WIN the election and we will get Trump and his bunch of cronies out of office. Trump is getting his ass kicked in the polls and KNOWS it!

I think it may be a mistake to make your messages to the public sound too "campaigny." If it sounds like a campaign ad, it's not going to resonate with people as a personal message. You want to create the impression that your client (Biden) is as warm as the ad. Don't sound fake.
That's bad news 4 Biden. These 62% of voters R probably Trump supporters. At every opportunity, Biden supporters shout from the roof tops how much they viciously hate Trump &amp; "want him out of there". Trump supporters R more reserved &amp; civil minded.

1/2 Biden's not my choice but unfortunately we're at that "greater of two evils" ballot and imo not voting for Biden only helps Trump. Biden will at least work to get things back to where they were, which still isn't good enough but better than the alternative of more degradation

Trump stated that there would be bloodshed in every community if Biden is elected.  Trump tends to use scare tactics whenever possible.  More scare tactics, I am trembling!This president likes to blow a ton of  steam. A bunch of fluff.
Which isn‚Äôt to say that Biden isn‚Äôt those things. He very well might be. But to suggest that opposing providing ANY legitimacy to what has simply been a broken tool to our collective liberations is in any way an excercise in privilege is, quite frankly, stupid as fuck.
But Biden isn‚Äôt the president
You cannot make the claim that Biden is the vote for lesser of two evils or the best case scenario for *yet another* failed election cycle without also acknowledging WHY, perhaps, those who have been most failed by it aren‚Äôt particularly enthused about have to compromise. Again.
And to think that those who aren‚Äôt the most disillusioned by this are those who are incredibly marginalized under a Trump Presidency, who were also marginalized under an Obama presidency, and who will continue to be marginalized under a Biden presidency is incredibly naive.
And we have joe Biden. Yay. üôÑ it‚Äôs like eating a bowl of shit like  the queen said so eloquently
You are so right. 3 months later that is. Hindsight is 20-20. Thanks anyway Mr. Biden.
Yeah, I mean I pretty much would be happy with all of Biden's final choices, though I'd be happier with some than others.
That is the dumbest idea I have seen in a while.  At least since the Democrats decided to nominate Biden.
But framing this argument around people who are wholly unaffected by who sits in the White House instead of the several dissenters who WOULD be directly affected by a Trump OR Biden presidency is intentionally disingenuous and misses the point completely.
If Biden steals it, ditto..
There are several cases you can make FOR voting for Biden that I think are legitimate cases. I mean, I DO plan to, reluctantly, vote for him despite my many moral objections to legitimizing the sham of electoral politics.
(I also disagree that Bass is necessarily closer to a Biden Dem than a post-Biden Dem.)
The insinuation that the people choosing to not cast a vote for Biden are simply petulant, whiny children who are upset that their preferred candidate (usually Bernie in this context) didn‚Äôt get the nom and are insulated and protected by their privilege, is incredibly reductive.

I'm not a fan of Biden.  But you better believe I'll be voting for him. Vote your conscience in every other office.  The Presidential slot has to be voted out on strategy. End of story.
Democrats need to stop giving Bernie and his surrogates a seat at the table. They are not here for you. They only want to co-opt the Democratic Party for their own agenda.
Joe Biden is showing you exactly who he is with this Veep drama.
Don't let Trump gaslight you.  Read the platform for yourself. #RememberInNovember #VoteBlue   Trump distorted many elements of the Biden-Sanders unity platform:
To be honest, I am tired of hearing what a bunch of backseat drivers think about who Biden picks for VP. We have serious problems to address and I want Biden to pick whoever he feels would be best for the country. If I trust him enough to vote for him, then I trust his VP pick.
My take away from the AG Barr hearing: 1. Slander as precursor to indictment revelations 2. Find out if DOJ will wait until after election  3. Biden NEEDS Vote by Mail

She got my vote, but for now she's right where she needs to be, as long as MA has a Republican governor. Biden will need every Democratic senator.
Because #Biden can't make a full #sentence!
You're not allowed to criticize them either. Point out what a massive piece of shit Biden is and how his record shows he should never be let near power again and the libs will never stop calling you Russian or accusing you of being a Trump supporter.
Poor old Biden. I feel sorry for him. He got old, has dementia and is now being led by the nose by Democrats. He might as well be drugged. Even if he is a Democrat I just believe he is being abused. No one deserves to be used like that. He print thinks they will kill him.
Biden has been in Washington since 1972, why hasn't he fixed anything?
not voting for biden because it‚Äôll make you feel better is privilege
Meanwhile, Kamala is out here elevating Biden‚Äôs plans when she doesn‚Äôt have too.
What if he did? Does it matter if Biden got caught over there or over here? These fake news asshats are always pretending the crime itself doesn't matter with Democrats, but the method by which the crime is discovered is the story. Bullshit.

Too let the people k ow how serious the Biden team is, you need to announce you whole cabinet when you announce your running mate.  This is serious to us!!!
Exactly because we‚Äôll have a hell of a lot more issues to deal with. Number one on that list would be:  1. Oh Fuck Biden is president
Biden needs someone with FIRE to complement his cool decency. Passion and compassion is a winning combination.
There is a black woman on the committee.  I don‚Äôt recall her name but she is on Biden‚Äôs staff.
Im questioning Biden‚Äôs judgment to have some of these old white male politicans on the vetting team, and emboldened to say what they are saying publicly about Kamala. They are foregoing preparedness &amp; leadership for the right kind of black women. One with ZERO political ambition.
That Biden meme came true "how do i pdf"
How about some recent video of Biden struggling to form a coherent sentence?
Not persuasive to me. I like Susan Rice. It should be someone the public knows and trusts, and I trust her. I had to Google Karen Bass (I'm not a Democrat but will vote for Biden).
False news. What are y‚Äôall going to tell the truth. When it‚Äôs too late and Biden in office and we all go downhill

Biden is the lies
We absolutely cannot have this lying, foul-mouth Rice woman becoming Biden's VP running mate. She would be a huge detriment to our country.  Do not pick her, Joe.
Don't listen to this hype. Biden will choose who he blieve is the best suited as his VP. It's his choice. Biden 2020
That‚Äôs a pretty broad stoke of the brush you painted half the country with, and almost as disparaging as Trump is. I disagree. Calling others names doesn‚Äôt help win Biden any Republican votes. #JustSaying #WeWillVote
If the GOP says it, it‚Äôs a lie.  Biden doesn‚Äôt want to defund the police now and didn‚Äôt while he was VP.  Congress aka purse strings were controlled by the GOP.  Lie, lie, lie
Gotcha. I still wonder if the ‚Äùgamble‚Äù is worth it though for Biden. His one weakness if we can call it that isn't he Hispanic vote.
This talk of 2024 needs to stop, Biden will make the choice as to if he runs again in 2024. If Kamala is our VP then we do not need to be advancing the claims others are making that Kamala just wants president in 2024. No she will run in 2028 if Biden decides to run again.
Warren and Duckworth are clearly the best choices for VP and they‚Äôre both getting ignored SMH this is how I‚Äôm gonna give my vote to Biden in November
I‚Äôm holding onto the hope that Biden being around for as long as he has will see this for what it is and choose her anyway.
Correction it‚Äôs the #chinavirus and I guess since you‚Äôre a Biden supporter you support corruption. Later...
I realize biden in up in age, and these are his peeps, but for the love of god man, trust the younger generations, listen to them too. Folks like Ed Rendell and Dodd are not the answer. Broaden your list of advisers on this.

Why would we swear any allegiance to a system that has enabled some Cosby/Weinstein open secret in our democracy?  Obviously, if we're on a spectrum Biden and his inappropriate touching, isn't racist is WAY BETTER than the fascism of the child rapist in office Trump.
Barr and Co will DOMINATE the news cycles with "THE LIB ELITE SEX CRIMES" Biden and his creepy touch will be everywhere. The atrocious, disgusting things that Trump and Co are guilty of (child rape&amp;Nader's pedobeastiality) wont matter, bc the media are co-conspirators

Cuomo's incompetence is directly responsible for 1/3 of those.  If Trump was partying in Chinatown with Nancy or listened to Biden instead of shutting down travel, there would have been a LOT more.
I have plenty of problems with Bass (mainly she and Biden have wrong diagnosis of Republican Party and delusional that they will work with Dem) but this is not one of problems. Red baiting is stunningly stupid.
Okay I‚Äôm confused about something. You made the argument that there‚Äôs no difference in material conditions under Trump vs. hypothetical Biden, right? Just want to clarify
Biden has a problem. Women vote and his "allies" are damaging his campaign because women can't be ambitious or something.
That cause it never happened. Even Trump hating lawyers wouldn‚Äôt take the case cuz they knew it was bogus. It was shopped around for years by a Jerry Springer producer
It never happened. A Jerry Springer producer started that entire thing

Just a thought...you are spot-on to many of the challenges in American politics, particularly about President Trump. What are your thoughts on Biden? It seems to me that either choice for us in the fall is scary.
I won't generalize whose all bad or good , but Sanders, Harris, Biden, among others want to make changes. They do say in politics, you don't want to see how bills are made, it's like making sausage in the factory. For those who support it, they aren't going anywhere.
Here are some facts for you:  Lindsey Graham: Donald Trump is a race baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot. You can make America great again by telling Trump to go to hell. Joe Biden is a good man.
You mean Biden? Did you diagnose that yourself, or did you get it from some "conservative" media outlet?
I see where you‚Äôre coming from. I want to believe that now is the time that people will actually be more aware. Anecdotally, I see people involved in politics now who never were before and most of them are critical of Biden. I‚Äôd love to see some data on this; don‚Äôt know how...
It was a bad bill, and Joe Biden deserves criticisms so does everyone who voted for it.   Lot of folks saw it for what it was and voted no. John Lewis, Maxine Waters, COLIN PETERSON, and Jerry Nadler to name a few
I bet if Trump decides to run again Biden runs for a second term, especially if there is no COVID-19 pandemic.  That alone is a selling point to re-elect Biden
If DJT loses and it's close in the EC map, I bet he runs on that he "was robbed by mail in ballots and now there is no COVID-19 pandemic (God willing the case by 2023), let's MAGA after the antifa regime of Joe Biden."

It‚Äôs easy to understand it‚Äôs because you want to make a party better I can justify voting for Biden by saying Republicans are more likely to win elections without Trump in office I can even say it would be easier to win in 2024. Trump approval = 40% = aweful.  Never above 50
I do he‚Äôs a whole pedophile but guess what so is Trump, I know a lot about Biden actually. Wish he wasn‚Äôt the other candidate but he is so
Trump is seen By voters as a very conservative Republican so a moderate Republican can more easily go to the democratic party and say they are a moderate or conservative Democrat. Joe Biden has a very conservative voting record. He happens to be running on a progressive platform
47 years. 47 years Biden didn't do anything. Yall are idiots if you think that's changing
it‚Äôs not bc of a candidate or one politician it‚Äôs based on the president which is different. there are already progressive Dems Who don‚Äôt support Biden but they didn‚Äôt become Republicans. To become a Republican you would have to object that Biden is too liberal...
yet another thing Biden and Co. will have to fix
The thing with the Maybes and the Depends Who Biden Picks for VP is that there's always some "legitimate" reason to end up having to vote for Trump again. What would even tip the scales for Hurd at this point?
My position is it's not racist or voter suppression. I don't care if Biden or Trump wins because I won't vote for either
I hope you get better. Biden is sick. Pray he doesn't die soon.
But it wasn‚Äôt Donnie, it was Barry, at a funeral, in a church, lying about peaceful protests, forgetting that democrat Robert Byrd filibustered the Civil Rights Act. The same democrat that, Joe Biden praised.  Hmmm imagine that
It's a fact. Pray for Me Biden. He never accomplished anything. Total loser sad they are using him like a sack of meat.
Hope to see you and President Bush endorse and support Biden.   #CountryOverParty #PrinciplesOverPolitics
Trump is our next POTUS . Don't concern yourself with Biden but pray he's not dying.
Lol Biden has less than 200 on Biden‚Äôs live streams and can‚Äôt fill a gym. No one is excited for Biden. Biden has 20 gafs and isn‚Äôt gonna do debates. Ppl leaving democrat parties in droves . Sorry you mental and can‚Äôt see it haha . U mean the same poll that was wrong in 2016 haha
Biden should be thankful for that.
Bill Clinton, pedophile. Joe Biden, obvious pedophile. Barack Obama, pedophile.
forcing fucking Joe Biden ads on me offends me and hurts me as well. As you are no longer a public forum I guess I can sue you now

JUST NOW: Nunes declines to answer if he received information from Ukraine meant to damage Biden
Biden is no POTUS and never will be.
Biden is incapacitated. Can't b POTUS.
andI see what your saying but I definitely think Biden is a better pick between these two horrible choices
Given your OP-ed from April excoriating Biden for suggesting Trump would do exactly what he did today (try to delay an election) , I'd say your crystal ball is awfully wonky...
Yes. The (looney tunes) Nobel Peace Prize for Obama in 2009 was a ‚Äúthank god, you guys aren‚Äôt totally insane after all‚Äù moment. By 2021, there are two scenarios: a rampant Trump, or a hobbled Biden Administration. America will be deeply diminished in either case.
Biden wrote the Women's Against Violence Act.
That‚Äôs why republicans are coming out to vote Biden, Nov 3rd will shock you bro...
Huh? No president is perfect by a long shot and never will be in a country that runs on capitalism. We currently have a president that‚Äôs openly racist homophobic and has ties w Epstein. He‚Äôs also giving hateful people validation in this country sooooo Biden is no where near a
I don‚Äôt think his people are smart enough. He should do something for the Bernie supporters at times in the 2016 race Trump said things to make them them; As the election gets closer I‚Äôm sure he will talk about Biden being establishment and talk about trade and other issues
It's the tweet saying there's no energy in the Biden campaign for me.  I mean we're about a socially-distance Campaign where people are seated far apart, and often televised live to millions of viewers.  Best to avoid these discussions TBH cos people be digging down rabbit holes
id love to hear from any of the ppl who continuously bring up the june debate moment as a reason to not trust harris, why the attacks on biden from warren never come up at all. she called dude a republican and said he wasnt the guy for this moment AFTER Joe won SC

My theory is he was a top Biden VP candidate until they decided they wanted a woman on the ticket.  I also think Sanders might have offered him as well. In an alternative universe if Sanders wins the nomination he has to go middle for VP. Who does he go with? Bernie/Buttigieg üòè

If Biden wins, he‚Äôll retire within six months and the Deep State will have the wild-eyed, radical VP as their marionette...
ALL of the candidates attacked Biden. He was the front runner. Harris‚Äô ‚Äúattack‚Äù was mild compared to the others. Warren lit Joe up more than once. Why do we never hear about that instead of the debate?
True but the safer choice is biden imo hes the more likely to get trump out of office and for that reason alone he has my vote tbh
These are the same people who support Biden, a man who has been caught on video touching little girls inappropriately and saying weird shit. At least Nicki is not a fucking pedophile herself. When her brother was arrested she never came out in support of him
Nah joe biden weird af too but theres no way trump is the better candidate so out of the two evils hes the better choice.
Wow - the blood sacrifice of animals - YEAH! Biden, you are the panderer of panderers. I mean, your Tweet writer is, anyway.
i don't trust liberals nor lefists. the riots are out of hand, they're destroying america. biden doesn't know what he's talking about ever, i mean i just watched a clip where he said "we should re-elect trump" ... nuff said.

Vote blindly, and harbor victim mentality. You cant help people like that. And folks want to vote for a guy like Joe Biden who spends his days in a box memorizing talking points hoping that the stem cell brain injections work for him come debate time. Cause if he screws up during
Oh I'm well aware. And he wants his supporters to not accept it if/when Biden wins. He's sowing the seeds for civil unrest.
Do not let this headline fool you, live your life like Joe Biden is losing until he raises his hand to take the oath. Do not give up, do whatever it takes to get DJT out of office.
Dude, you have way bigger concerns with the Biden family and their billions in payola from foreign entities.  And the fact that   likely just crapped himself.
Like Elizabeth Warren, Sanders looked pretty good until the voting started. Neither one was able to assemble the broad multiracial coalition of working-class voters that has given their support to Biden. Sanders energized younger voters, but not in the numbers he wanted or needed

YOU PICKED A DISGUSTING RACIST AS VP JOE BIDEN &amp; LIED ABOUT WHO HE REALLY IS! You should be ashamed of yourself for letting the KKK BlackFace Democrats EXPLOIT you when Trump is the one who has a record Criminal Justice Reform fixing Joe Biden's WRONGS
Biden and Hillary have both absolutely nailed on the head the many problems Trump brings to democracy, but are discredited because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust playing politics‚Äù
KH could trigger a counter vote.. so I'm sure the dnc.. I mean Biden will pick her.. snatch the defeat from the jaws of victory.
For office Mr. Joe Biden no wonder you didnt get anything done on Criminal Justice Reform when it was Joe that authored the Crime Bill which jailed mostly African American males, all Joe Biden, and Dems did and are doing is using you to get Black votes and you just let them
A president is not supposed to try to push millions of people‚Äòs buttons that‚Äôs not a presidential Trump said he could be presidential if he got elected. It‚Äôs not going to be funny if he loses to Biden

That is Biden with head problems and he forgets. Germany does not speak for the world. I just came from a foreign country and he is very respected in Asia and south America.
Biden is in the Silent Generation. Y'all should demand better.  You have no standards.
What do we get after 4-8 years of nothing except Joe Biden heading up Occupy and Standing Rock. Oh wait. He did that too, didn't he?  What are you voting in?  A nicer Trump?
It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs funny. How can you possible take this guy serious? #Biden #bidenstepdown
Joe Biden said under his presidency nothing is realistically gonna change, no ubi, no healthcare for all, no healthcare for children especially. He is not your savior. He cant even fucking speak on his own‚ùó‚ùó
oh sure they love people of faith Biden is a fraud and if you elect him you'll find out he lied to you as he destroys the suburbs
I disagree we don‚Äôt need a radical left agenda, and we don‚Äôt need someone who doesn‚Äôt complete sentences or remember where he is half the time. Biden is a sad joke. Democrats should protest against their party for failure to offer up a legitimate candidate.
This is who you‚Äôre voting for ??? Serpent Biden
This Obama‚Äôs the worse of the worse 4 giving a democrat political speech at John Lewis‚Äô funeral. It was a ‚Äústir up the hate‚Äù political campaign speech 4 Biden. There was no social distancing at the funeral. MSM &amp; democrats didn‚Äôt care.
BREAKING: Katrina Pierson: Joe Biden ‚ÄòHas No Respect for the Personal Agency of a Black American‚Äô
Yup.  But Obama told them to get behind Biden.
Saying that choosing between Biden and Trump is choosing the ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù is a dangerous and reckless assertion. It implies that the two evils, while different, are equal. They are not equal. There is a very clear right and wrong choice. Please speak intentionally.
The fact that Biden... the presumptive Democratic nominee for president... didn't speak at Lewis's funeral suggests he might not be up to such occasions. Did he even attend?
Let all the celebrities vote for Biden as they did for Hilary - he's still going to lose in spectacular style

Democrats are clearly retarded.  Biden is clearly racist and had the record to back it up.   He's suffering from dementia and is hiding.   He recently said nothing to worry about with China and look at us now.  Who in their right fucking mind would vote for him???
Biden is gonna drag us into a better tomorrow?   Have you seen his campaign?
That ain't no shit. Between a cabal of traitors and Joe Biden.
Democrat Party, all they can do is bash Trump. I test any democrat what good would it do besides getting Trump out to have Biden as President. He cannot put three sentences together. I KNOW you wish you had another alternative. I get it. Educate yourself don't be lazy.

Biden doesn‚Äôt say windmills cause cancer, water is wet, doesn‚Äôt want to buy Greenland or say the Corona Virus will just one day go away, doesn‚Äôt mock a disabled reporter or call Mexicans racists or praise the KKK. Complete sentences! Watch. Full interview
Please watch your President who is so excited he passed a ‚Äúhard‚Äù dementia test. Omg. Joe Biden has had a stutter for ages. Read up on it.
I wasn‚Äôt aware one had to be an actual candidate to give campaign speeches. Has he not been campaigning and raising money for Biden by giving speeches? Think harder next time.
Yess!! Biden!! #EndHumanTraffickingNow
I don‚Äôt care for Biden. In fact, I really hate Biden.  So for me, supporting the Democrat ticket will be about supporting the woman who is selected as VP candidate in hopes that she assumes the presidency soon after inauguration.  The VP announcement can‚Äôt come soon enough!
Trump talked about it; Biden did it #TaraReade
This is what Democrats want to do in all our gated communities and HOAs all across the country if Biden is elected.  It is how he plans to fill his equal housing objective.

Biden comes across as clueless as to how technology works.
During a virtual fundraiser today, Biden referenced Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying the election, suggesting it was a way to distract from Rep. John Lewis‚Äô funeral.   Trump ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to focus on what‚Äôs going on today with our buddy, and your close friend, Jim,‚Äù he told Clyburn.
I mean Biden is welcome to rescind those agreements with amlo.
It is important to notice that the Biden campaign is painfully careful not to publicly mention too many reversals of Trump's agenda beyond the obvious (Paris, WHO exit, etc.)  Not to give all too much ammunition  to the Trump campaign.

If he agrees, ask him how much money he thinks he would make if the DNC offered him $1M per net EC vote for a Biden win.  Shut out Trump -&gt; $538M.

JUST IN: Biden Predicted Trump Might Try to Delay Election
imma assume people pushing everyone to vote for biden are also ok with settling romantically for the first dude who gives them a sideways glance huh. u deserve better bud.
If we have to settle for Biden, then Gabbard should be VP.
You have really shown your dictatorial core. We will have an election, and I and my entire family will be voting for Joe Biden.
weren‚Äôt you idiots making jokes about this a few months ago when Biden raised the possibility of Trump wanting to delay the election?? And yet silence...so what‚Äôs going on?
BREAKING: Biden Predicted Trump Might Try to Delay Election
Its a wonder they didn't let Biden get up there and for a collection for his son.
Is there a chance we See Merrick Garland get the seat should Biden win and Ruth retire?
If Joe Biden wins, the Coronavirus will be over on November 4. If President Trump gets re-elected then blue state politicians will make everyone wear masks and keep everything locked down until January 21, 2025.

White House Spiritual Advisor Blasts Biden‚Äôs Marijuana Policy Record
Again the establishment wins either way with Biden, but they lose with Bernie.  The people who are gonna be the goats are the blk folks, who were led into supporting Biden.
Come on.....this is petty. I'm no fan of Biden but this is obviously due to a lag in the network. This could and does happen to anyone. If we're going to go at him it has to be for an actual blunder.
Bernie Sanders thinks he and AOC will be the shadow President, riding Biden like the sick horse he is. Nov 3rd will be the greatest kick in the nads that Sanders and the entire Dem party have ever had since the Civil War.
Joe Biden would've said, Cornpop was a bad dude," (while referring to Lewis) but fortunately his campaign staff locked him in his basement instead
Good thing that's not the reason I'm voting for biden. Voting for 45 on the other hand says a lot bout u, ur morals, intellect, bias, etc., etc., etc.
This is also being witnessed in many other western democracies as well. I like to believe that Prime Minister Trudeau's Liberal win, despite losing an outright majority, signaled a defeat in the march for more authoritarianism. Joe Biden winning this fall will be key as well.
Biden can't remember what state he is in, can't read off of a teleprompter, needs help walking, forgets what he is saying.  Was involved in the corruption against President Trump and you want him as President?  LOL
Wonder which child wrote this Biden or Nancy?
We gotta take the good with the bad üò≠  Also a lot of women have switched to Biden, even white women are leaning heavily towards Biden over Trump. So their's still hope!
New Polls Show Trump Gaining Ground On Biden In Battleground States

Do you think Biden will lift any of those sanctions
Trump bragging about taking the cognitive test was bait too. The more the media tried to dunk on him for saying it was easy, the more Joe Biden would have to be encouraged to take it. And how would he do?  These people are IDIOTS. üòÇü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Listening to our next President  on a delegate call. Honored to serve as a Biden Delegate for SD15. Onward to November.
It's weird that people are getting worked up about this. Just prior to a very important primary, Cliburn laid out the permission structure for the real base of the Democratic Party to support Biden. The base went to Biden therefore Bernie's outside chance became unsustainable.
The truth cannot he hidden from the news no matter how hard he tries to ingnore the truth. Biden 2020
I do not care what is on Biden's platform/ website.  His policies are not enough to meet the moment.  And even if he endorsed UBI, I do not believe him.  I do not trust him to believe in UBI, do not trust him to follow through. Yang, I can believe.  Stop gas lighting yourself.

Biden is winning female support by a 59%-35% margin, according to polls taken in June. The % of parents that want their children to return to school is irrelevant to the amount of women, particularly women of color, who support Biden.

All I can say is everyone who is voting for Biden as President better start saving as much money as you can between now and nov. Because if yall believe his lies will all be screaming I cant pay my Bill's or buy food. It will be noones fault but yalls for for putting him there!!

Joe Biden has a long to-do list if he wins the White House
Biden has proposed measures to help Americans buy their first homes, raise the federal minimum wage and boost taxes on the wealthy and corporations.
I just can‚Äôt stand to watch MSNBC   So biased. I try to see their side for a second and they are delusional. Trying to convince the world that Biden is going to win. Laughable.
I hope Biden goes in on 1/20/21 &amp; has the FBI take ALL ELECTRONICS out to be reviewed &amp; possible criminal charges brought.
So u're saying that we have Obama and Biden to thank for u? Well, it's a shame that u're not giving credit where credit is due. Cuz I know Vlade, the dumbest of Americans, and ur mom and dad are who we have to thank for u. Also a shame that u admit it wasn't anything u did. Wow.

No, this is the DEMOCRATS playing games. They are desperate!! Notice how no one is talking  any kinds of shit about Biden?? 40 yrs in office and never done shit!! Lmao
If you want your future destroyed just elect Biden!  He has radical plans that will ruin this country!
Just think how great it will be when Biden wins and this will no longer be limited to states run by leftist Democrats.  What a future it will be!  Idiots
Still blaming Obama for bad testing supplies left by his administration for a virus that was never even heard of until this year.  Seriously just stop already. Obama Biden Democrats have nothing to do with Trump not doing a damn thing to lead this country when we needed it
No, this will allow China to be the world dominant by 2030 if Biden wins!
I agree, law &amp; order, put our country back on track and make us great again. So vote for Joe Biden! Unless you‚Äôre these fellas right here
The kids are too fucking stupid these days. They will just keep using it. They don't care. They just want to watch each other eat tide pods!! Pretty much sums up Biden fans too
I get why Biden voters act so weird now!! Their not from America! It makes sense
Their both crooked as hell!! Ones been there 3.5 yrs, the other one has been there for 40 plus years!! Now, common sense tells you one thing!! Dude has not done shit!! In 40 yrs. I dont care what Trump has done. Save our country!! Dont give it to the Chinese like biden wants!
And who‚Äôs on the unmasking list - Joe Biden  BOOM
Biden giving a speech during Barr's hearing is classic Biden campaign strategy. #HidinBiden
Show me one with Biden?
DM Hey Jake ... Hope you &amp; Jerusha are well. I certainly understand this tweet &amp; I understand your being unwilling to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù for re-tweeting it for all to see.   It does present us with a dilemma: Who do we vote for in November? Are you more comfortable voting for Biden?
This Democrat is voting Red!!! Blood red too!! I mean Red cuz if your voting for Biden, you voting to become like China! Facts. Dems never did anything but legalize weed. Bout it!! Oh and Gay b.s
I've notice. Biden Voters are fucking weird. I almost wonder how many real accts there actually are
My father is the co-owner of a fairly large construction company, and he voted for Trump in 2016. He said he‚Äôd rather have Biden go back to Pre-Reagan tax rates than vote for Trump again. Despite the fact that it‚Äôs people like him being targeted by the Biden tax plan...
Dems and Biden will have to come to the middle if they have any chance to beat Trump. With this radical far left platform they will lose almost all of the Independent vote. I still don't think Biden will come close if he loses as much of the Black vote as some predict.
Trump destroyed everything he touched by making those around him as corrupt as he is Which is how he gains their loyalty and TPUSA is no exception. #Resistance #RuleOfLaw #Biden #Antifa #BLM #Protests #ProtectOurPress #WallOfMoms #NaziGOP #TrumpsGestapo #FascistBarr #DHSGestapo
I do too, if I thought Bernie would be able to beat Trump I would‚Äôve voted for him because he proposes the quickest path to universal coverage. But I know that he would‚Äôve been destroyed by Trump so I voted for Biden who serves as a more round about way towards universal coverage
I DONT CARE WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE!! BIDEN IS TOAST
Did you expect them to approve it when the candidate who supported it lost to the one who didn‚Äôt? Like I get being annoyed but why would you be surprised, more Democrats support Biden than Bernie so obviously the party wouldn‚Äôt put M4A on the platform.
If Biden wins the Democratic Party will be gone in five years? That‚Äôs a bold prediction!
How does a president not pay homage to a civil rights icon?  #JohnLewis
Still don't care!! Ex Democrat!! Biden and them can't win!! All will go to hell!! Sew how China is!! Thats how America will turn!! Mark my words
Its funny how much biden voters don't know what's next!! They dont call him China Joe for nothing
BIDEN IS TOAST!! #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDE
Well just create diversity and well get all of the #BLMTerrorists and #lgtbqterroists to vote for Joe!! That aught to get biden in the White house even though he's been there for 40 yrs and hasn't done a thing üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉü§£ü§£ü§£
Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol  #SmartNews
This November he sure will be!! He will go from V.p of 1st term to V.p of 2nd term!!! If you don't vote for Trump your doing nothing, but harm!! China Joe Biden and the Dems want to ruin America like Obama did!! Its all about money. I use to hate Grump too!! Ex dem
China Joe Biden! Quit Hiding, Beijing Biden!! We know who you roll with!!
Lmao!! Yessss!!!! To be from D.e.t and be a Biden fan blows my fucking mind!!! Guess you ride with China
#Trump2020 If you vote for China Joe Biden you are voting for China to become the next world dominant leader by 2030!! You dont realize that do you???!!!! Do your homework. The Democrats are evil and want to divide this Country!! Pls do your home work. The media lies!!
So I saw this sign pop up in my neighbors yard, they are strong rep and out of town .I texted them and someone put it on their lawn as a prank so of course I asked if I can have it .. so now I‚Äôm proudly displaying my Biden sign that was paid for by a Republican... feels so good.
If you want China to be the World Dominant country by 2030!! Vote Joe China Biden!! Mark my words! The Democrats are not for America. They are for a different Agenda! I will never vote democratic again! I dont care what Trump did. Man is our only hope!!
Sure!! You wish China Joe Hidden!! At this point anyone can see this is gonna be a disaster for you Jo3! We dont grust you or the DEMOCRATS AGENDA!! IF YOU WANT CHINA TO BE WORLD DOMINANT!!! VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN CUZ THAT'S THEIR PLAN! DEMOCRATS SOLD AMERICA FOR MONEY
Please. Then actually bounties will be made and Hunter Biden will be insured he gets dads cut.
Not true!  The left voting for Biden are the anarchists in our streets right now destroying our country!

We are 6 trillion in debt thanks to Trump.  Biden owns guns and will not take them away.  Business was booming under Obama and Clinton.  Down during Bush, Bush and now Trump.  Tell me how we are great right now?
You can‚Äôt blame Trump for China‚Äôs virus they unleashed on the world. Else you blame every leader in the world. And if communties don‚Äôt care when they burn down their own homes and businesses that‚Äôs just a mental deffency. Oh that may be Biden!
Why are we not holding Biden and Obama accountable?
I have driven from TX to NJ then west to Wyoming over the past 3 weeks. Saw 1 Biden sign (home made).  Lots of Trump signs. Also interesting was the fact there are help wanted signs everywhere!!!!!
Yes, our Country could be lost forever if Biden is elected President. He wouldn‚Äôt actually be president he‚Äôd be run by the Democratic Socialists like AOC, Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley.
I‚Äôve told you before I hate both of them. Put me straight down the middle. I think he‚Äôs done some good and done some bad. And I think Biden will be good and bad. We are fucked no matter what bro
Come on Sid. You know the questions Biden gets are just as soft &amp; you know I‚Äôm not a trump guy. I will say that was a good one and made me laugh.
Don‚Äôt worry Stephen, we know how you feel and also wonder how in the world you could support Biden or any democrat these days.  Never understand it....
Biden and schiff
Just like all Trump does is talk about Obama, Hilary and Biden?! ü§£ Hypocrisy!
Sounds pretty accurate!!! Especially if Biden won, which he won't. Just saying, the DEMOCRATS are playing games!!! They will cheat and lie to get what they want! #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
Because a vote for Biden is a vote for China!
Obama the worst president our nation ever survived along with his do nothing VP Biden.
What about senility and cognitive decline in Biden?  Can you really not see it? Why would anyone elect a president who is senile?
Biden didn‚Äôt do shit when he was in congress 50 years!  What‚Äôs different now?  He‚Äôs part of the SWAMP!!!
Yea Biden will be the dog right???üòÇüòÇ
And what does senile old Biden know about the virus?  He‚Äôs too senile to understand anything!
Yes Biden is the dog right???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump gives me more hope then Biden ever could cause he knows how to rebuild the economy - built the best in the world bf the China virus and will do it again!  Biden will send all the jobs to China like him and Obama did before !
Nope that‚Äôs trump!  He wants to help with the destruction going on in the Democrat run cities!  Biden has said nothing about the anarchists and wants to defund police!
No one has been better to the military than trump!  Biden and Obama cut our military down to nothing!  Trump rebuilt it!  FACT!!!
Nope!  Trump‚Äôs already on that!  Dems don‚Äôt want their kids in school.  They want them to be stupid and lazy so they can fall in line with the socialists under Biden!

That's probably the only way to make Biden's economic numbers look good (cf Obama's recovery summer). Literally shut down the economy for multiple months, and VOILA. Economic recovery.
I dont care what he has done!!! No one wants the Satanic Dems to win!! Biden has no chance at all! Remember the words the silent majority when your pissed off after the elections!!
Just 2 satanic PEDOPHILES having a convo about how they will screw the world over even more if Biden were to win!! He won't though.
Sure!!! You look religious! If you believe in God there is no way you would want to vote for Biden. They are all part of a Satanic culture. Democrats are. They started the Kkk because the Republicans allowed the first black ppl in congress. The dems are evil.
Lmao!!! Cnn has you all brainwashed. Its sad how many ppl just  cant see the truth!! Look at what Obama and Biden did??
No Biden signs or bumper stickers seen.
Biden hasn‚Äôt been correct about anything in several years and he doesn‚Äôt remember that.
So the Senator is saying that Trump will have caused the demoralization of 40 million Americans, and a depression in our economy, and Biden will wake up with the need to fix that, and it is a reason to vote for TRUMP?!?!?  What a weird way to say it.
Big issue with Biden is if he wins he's going to be extremely averse to the kind of truth and reconciliation work we need. He's constitutionally averse to that kind of stuff.Right now, I‚Äôm participating in a grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.  They make a good team.  If she‚Äôs not the VP pick, I hope she‚Äôs his Secretary of the Treasury.
N shit.  It would be so dang easy to love instead of hate.
TY!!  I love this so much.
Throw away the damn key.
You are hottt tonight, King baby.  Oh, I see it's a Wed list.  Whatever.  FOLLOWED.  #FBR
Same. I‚Äôm gonna be lit for a week if Biden wins.
This gives me more hope.  I don't want to get comfortable, I do feel good about Biden.  Peace from a Boomer in Tejas.
if biden becomes president he will be blamed for the aftermath of corona virus. just like how they blamed obama for the horrible economy bush gave him.
It is when he thanks the people in the video.  If it had been Biden, or any other Democrat in that scenario, I'd believe the same.
The Dems love COVID. Trump filling football stadiums with his ralleys was a real problem. Especially when Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a cafe. Make no mistake, those that want to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday Americans must get rid of Trump.
This is symbolic of a Biden presidency. He will remain in the basement as his shadow government drafts and legislates new policy‚Äôs that will crush the American Economy.
You all scoffed when Biden (correctly) predicted that Trump might try to delay the election.  He's alleged widespread voter fraud, with zero evidence in the 2016 popular vote.  He's alleged that voting by mail is subject to widespread fraud. /1
If Biden picks Karen Bass as  VP, it is like Hindenburg picking Hitler as chancellor.
I just listened to your podcast with Rita.  It was great!  I‚Äôm a 65 yr old white woman who will be voting for Joe Biden.
We need you Joe Biden
I hope she doesn‚Äôt but she did already endorse Biden.
You got COVID-19 at a Trump rally that every expert advised against holding and you're trying to lecture BIDEN on listening to the wrong people? Wow. I'll give you one thing, you've got more balls than junior and Eric, combined.
Levin bashes Obama eulogy for John Lewis, calls Biden 'a quasi-Bull Connor and a quasi-George Wallace' | Fox News
1. Chad was trying to insinuate that Biden is a racist because of past comments, so I think Trump's own bs is relevant. 2. If you knew anything about John Lewis, you'd know that there was zero disrespect in President Obama's eulogy.  He made a call for action... /1
So many people have sour grapes about Biden being the nominee. They are attacking Kamala Harris and trying to minimize her in several ways. I am  just over it!
If you‚Äôre trying to pull in votes for Biden the way you moved up then you better get a helmet ‚õë.  I hear headboards can cause brain damage.
If Biden can‚Äôt debate in person then delay the election! Social media companies are ready to doctor all the Biden events to make him look like he knows what‚Äôs going on. He is not fit for office at all. He should help Hunter spend their I‚Äôll gotten gains.
The 14 month freshman Senator with zero experience? The man with his records sealed? Our first Muslim POTUS? Joe Biden's  idol? The Lyer in Chief?
yea, I'm sure Biden will this time say ALL 330m Americans have died of COVID. LOL
Have any of you listened and watched stuff  your presumptive nominee does and says??   Y‚Äôall know good and well, as does  that he can‚Äôt delay the election.
So remind us again how low Biden will go.
The idea that republicans will play nice with a biden administration ‚Äî that this is just a trump issue not a republican one ‚Äî needs to be shot into the sun immediately. This is a prime example of that, because he will absolutely have republican support.
I admire and respect AOC.  Biden has grown on me.  I'm a liberal.  I would eat dirt before I would support the racist pig.
Why shouldn't she be? Realistically, Biden may and probably should serve one term, and his VP is the presumptive nominee.. ambition is a damn good thing here.
Yeah, when Trump crushes Biden!
There will be an epic party and I might not be ‚Äúunmedicated‚Äù for a couple days IF Biden wins.
Just wait till we find out in a year or two, the number of positives and mortalities were garbage. Or, November if Biden wins ( no chance)
You don't understand Marxism OR socialism if you think Biden has embraced anything of the sort. It's really past time that Republican/right wingers educate themselves on definitions and philosophies of the words and types of govts they spew from their mouths.
Those of you who are bystanders and cheerleaders of trump's corruption should make your break now.  Endorse Biden.  Change your legacies from "complicit traitors and criminals" to "merely useful idiots".  It's too late for the ringleaders.
Cool  now do Biden/China.
Wow! How can anyone think he is capable of leading the greatest nation in the world! Biden can't people.
We don't want Biden in Texas!
was absolutely brilliant on  this morning.  I‚Äôd be very happy with her as Biden‚Äôs VP pick.

I'm not taking a damned thing until after President Biden purges the sycophants from trump's FDA.  What Public Health Experts Think About Expediting A Coronavirus Vaccine
Biden = 0bama. Does Biden want to make NASA Muslim again?
This is classic flawed thinking. Tax cut for the rich by trump A ok. Spending by Trump irresponsible but A ok compared to Dems bc one example of them wanting to spend more. Nevermind that Biden is on record he will roll back tax cuts on the rich and balance the budget.
Biden won‚Äôt remember these points tomorrow.
What is disgusting, is a man with a spray tan whining about about ramps being too slick for his leather souls or spilling water on a silk tie, amidst a PANDEMIC!. BIDEN / DEMINGS. 20/20!
But was he able to correctly identify the elephant?   Did Biden claim that windmills cause cancer?   Or that the Revolutionary Army took the airports?   Or claim that journalists should have to return their "Noble" prize, which was so named for noble behavior?   Etc., etc.
Sounds like it will be some kind of Joe Biden/Hunter Biden ludicrous lie....and the Trumpers will be ready to believe it, of course, but will anyone else?
Pretty sure I'm taking the next day off. I'll be up late waiting for them to reluctantly declare Trump the winner. Biden will win a handful of states, and they'll Harper on that all night.
Anything Trump's FDA approved will be suspect.  Joe Biden Urges Trump To Keep Coronavirus Vaccine Progress ‚ÄòFree From Political Pressure‚Äô
I don't know if you are temporarily barred from Twitter; this is a left-wing app, but I do appreciate your father, hope he wins in November. Joe Biden is a troll, who has no sense of decency nor, like Obama, really does not care for our country, but for his legacy
Since you‚Äôve messed it up so badly, Biden will do so beginning in January!
They didn‚Äôt dismiss it, they destroyed it. Put us behind months and made sure we still have no hope as we approach August. Any chance Biden is the white knight to endorse the triple cocktail that saves us in about 30-45 days?
You really think trump is smarter than Biden? üòÇ Did Biden get F‚Äôs in college? I didn‚Äôt know....
This was interesting to read.
Biden/Dodd VP sandwich?
He could go to the Capitol rotunda and pay his respects.  VP Joe Biden did.  There was no one there other than the guards.  If Trump can golf, he can pay his respects to a hero of the Civil Rights movement.
How in the world can you embrace Joe Biden who caused the murders of the SEAL team in Afghanistan by his treasonous act of revealing info that outed this group.  That just shows what an opportunist you are and that you are a racist and bias against the U.S.

I saw a great Biden ad on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.
...for Biden win...
I can't imagine what people think that Biden MIGHT do, that would be worse than what Trump HAS done.
One of the few ways that Biden could manage to lose to Trump is to turn his campaign into a blm or a sjw campaign.  He got the nomination by being the boring pick, he should keep riding that train.
And, sadly, if Biden wins and doesn't perform a miracle (which he won't) GOP will blame him for everything and then in 24 this shit just reruns itself.
GOP will retweet this and say it's Biden's America
They aren‚Äôt? Most academics are just concerned with the common good vs the fuck you got mine of boomers. Don‚Äôt confuse the hyper screeching left with academics. If the left was as liberal as people think Biden wouldn‚Äôt have handily beat Bernie.

Cognitive Test. Trump. Biden. Campaign. Flashpoint. (from
Laura's show: You are undoubtedly the stupidest man; your yelling showed that you are on the defensive and rightly so, your party is corrupt, full of thugs (by the way, democrats are thugs, ex. Maxine Waters). Biden is not capable of leading, not at this time.
Running Biden‚Äôs campaign is whatever you call the opposite of a Kobayashi Maru.
Here‚Äôs the deal. Yeah, Biden is beating Trump in a lotta polls and that‚Äôs cool. The fact that during a massive pandemic nicknamed the #Trumpvirus with major unrest across the nation, that they are still close in the polls, shows how strong his base is. #vote
Didn't you also claim to have PROOF that the Ukraine Scandal involved more than the Biden's?  On to the next imaginary scandal, eh Rudy?
If there is justice, trump will watch Biden's inauguration on a TV from a jail cell in shackles.  Two persons, that is, a man and a woman will be watching trump through a camera.  Not in order, quite, but I used the words in a sentence.  Do I get extra credit still?
because neither you nor Biden can pass one...#GoAwayAlready
the obama administration left a pandemic playbook and trump ignored it.  obamas administration created an office to prepare for pandemics and trump defunded it.  obama/biden had CDC officials in china to detect and contain outbreaks and trump pulled them out.   whos fault is it?
Suburban housewife here. You're the creepy uncle I don't invite to Thanksgiving, because I refuse to tell my daughter's to just avoid you, and never be alone w/ you.  I'm voting for Biden.

Ol Plugs Biden....its puddin time punkin...
Look!   Live Obama and BidenI dont like Biden but he better win. Trump is even worse now than when he was first elected, we cant take 4 more years of him. At least Biden acknowledges the problems we face. Trump just ignores them and hopes they go away. #VoteBiden2020  #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica

No republican would vote for Biden after seeing the agenda he‚Äôs put through
I doubt Texas and Nebraska are lean red, id wager TX is likely and Nebraska is safe. Also if Biden wins Arizona then he will probably win the rust belt too

Hey Sunk, not to worry.  Trump will win. üòä  We'll make Biden out to be a child with dementia.  That won't be hard, huh?If the question is whether or not she is going to kiss Biden's ass, well the answer  is hell no. Will she do her job and work her ass off, yes she will.   America is a misogynist and racist country and what's happening to Kamala is really bad. The Democratic party is failing her.
This is Biden's campaign and it's on him to correct this.    This is a bad look for Biden and I'm starting to believe Biden is in on the hit job. He needs to get rid of these old white men quick.
I'm not happen with Biden not addressing this situation and his lack of a response speaks volumes.
Joe Biden can't say 'God.'
I had to turn it off, this was a funeral.Not a rally. And if it was, why didn‚Äôt you let Biden speak?
And you think Biden is more coherent? Hell the main reason I am voting for Trump again is because Biden can‚Äôt put two coherent sentences together. It‚Äôs basically a choice of the lesser of two evils
To bad he won't be around to see it.  The votes will be tallied on electon night and only states that are too close to call may run over a day or two. When Biden wins he will be removed from office on January 20, 2021. His lawsuit won't do him any good.

Probably half as much vodka as Pelosi drinks in a month. Or contrariwise 1/4 the amount of pudding Biden needs to hide is dementia meds.
Nobody... NOBODY Listen to Biden Ever
It is some bullshit the way Kamala is being treated and I have to question Joe Biden for even hiring some of these people.
Why isn't Biden speaking out about Chris Dodd
Sounds like these old white men don't want Kamala in line to the presidency in 2024 if Biden decides to leave office.   The crazy part about this whole situation is the hit job is coming from Biden's allies and the Democratic party.
One minute black people aren't qualified enough or lazy and the next minute we are too ambitious. Make up your minds white people.  Obviously these allies of Biden aren't allies to the base of this party and he needs to denounce them.   This is some racist B.S.
Go away fake news.. And this spreading of the Chinese virus will end as soon as Biden is elected, right?
Sunny is speaking the truth. I just don't understand why Biden would keep someone like Chris Dodd on his staff after what he did. It doesn't make sense unless Joe feels the same way.   The note being seen isn't a coincidence to me. It is just another way of throwing us off.

Voters trust Biden's handlers right now more than they trust Trump's handlers &amp; both men need handling.  Politicians who side with the protesters I think will,  on the Wednesday after the Nov. vote,  wish they had been a little more George Patton &amp; a little less George McGovern
Remember Tian, that Obama began Asia pivot, an idiotic encirclement exercise, on the basis of State Dept advice; those folks are still there.   We'll see if Biden has the guts to walk back the nonsense.
I would vote for a moldy bowl of fruit before comrade orange. But goodness me, Biden is a bit of a wreck. But I guess at least he acts like an adult. Ouff, we need better politicians.

That's a great question. The Biden campaign better get their shit together because not picking the most qualified woman in Kamala Harris is not going to end well. Black women work too hard for this party to be put on the sideline. Chris Dodd needs to be put on the sidelines.

True! DONT FALL FOR THE BIDEN LIES! He is a China puppet &amp; will turn America into a socialist nation! üî¥üîµVOTE TRUMP üî¥üîµfor a safe, prosperous nation

There we go, then the statement I was annoyed by (that these images of current issues) somehow magically show up if Biden is president, are obviously false.  Glad we all agree!
Exactly, it‚Äôs why this is a stupid argument against Biden.  The one thing that‚Äôs different is baby fingers has been trying to address a hostile situation with more violence.
So then it‚Äôs not a valid statement that it would be Biden‚Äôs America.
They have free speech now but what would happen if Biden was elected?  Bye Bye free speech.
F U Joe Biden. You can't distinguish between your sister and wife.
Not smart when Biden won‚Äôt be president more than 3 months at most. And who gonna run the country?? Oh yeah you don‚Äôt know. Because they aren‚Äôt telling you. Don‚Äôt you wonder why?
Yes! Investigate Roberts &amp; Schumer &amp; Biden!
Vote straight Republican! Joe Biden should drop out
The democrat party press / propagandist are busy covering Biden in his basement.
It‚Äôs important to vote for your country, not the party name on your voter registration card.
So then it wouldn‚Äôt change under Biden!
Don please send someone to watch me vote for Joe Biden.

In 2016 I had serious issues with Hillary &amp; her team.  Remember she supported arming Ukrainians to fight Russians, just for ex.  I know Trump is bad but I will need to believe that Biden is not going to be also bad, in an assortment of slightly different ways than Trump is bad.
üî¥üîµNEVER VOTE FOR A LIBERAL! They will destroy our country! And Joe Biden is the worst! He keeps changing his stance, &amp; now he‚Äôs morphed into Bernie Sanders! He wants open borders, amnesty 4 illegals &amp; defund the police!üî¥üîµVOTE 4 TRUMP 4 a SAFE AMERICA!
If Biden doesn't harass UK, Canada, etc on a regular basis as Trump &amp; Pompeo do, immediately you will see other countries retreating from anti China nonsense they only adopted under our pressure.
Right.  Vice President Biden -- where do you stand on Assange?    Do you agree with Hillary, who said he should be in prison for life?    Tell us now, before we vote.
Delete that paycheck you just deposited if you're voting for Biden in November. Also, you can kiss your freedoms goodbye as well, but that's the price you have to pay if gov't is the answer before the question is ever asked. #SocialismSucks #MarxismSucks
Obviously confused. Nose pinched mouth open and cleared; blow into the mouth.... Pump the chest. In a fantasy pedos mind with age crippling what little sense Joe Biden had.
Crypt keeper? Demands air in it's nostrils like Biden.
they voted against Sanders. Just like people voted not Hillary. Now Biden going for Sanders and Warren craziness.  Even Democrats thought Biden has dementia before primary. Imagine that.
I sat out 2016.  If Biden takes the side of protesters against police I will sit out again this year.  But I am not opposed to federal troops interceding to curtail violent protesting &amp; to protect public spaces &amp; buildings.

Also, this is the really real world. There are in fact people who are racist. Right and left. Biden happens to be a perfect public example.
Having lived in Asia, yes. I can always also, heaven forbid, be genuinely interested in them as people and talk to them about their experiences. But, you do you and Biden is still racist.Completely agree, YS. This will be a huge problem for Biden if he picks a Scientologist to be his VP.  I do wonder why this is just coming out now, though.

It would be interesting to have a member of the House as VP. I like all of them. I want whoever can help Biden win. The rest can also help and continue to do whatever job they were doing.
Not bashing Bass. I refuse to drag a woman of color that is up for VP   But üëáüèæ may be a problem for Biden‚Äôs core base, black church women. Some may see Scientology as too fringe. They are not as feral about mixing faith &amp; politics as white evangelicals, but faith does play a part
There is no perfect candidate. She has had to work with the system she inherited. As VP she would be an excellent person to reform policing, esp with her social work background. Biden has a great final list. Would be delighted with any of them. #Biden2020
It doesn't matter who the Democratic Candidate is they will always find something to bitch about.  For the mess we are in right now, Biden is perfect to make this horrendous experiment of Anti-Democracy go away.  Sign way any of the Trump ignorance &amp; right this ship.
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!
My advice is everyone voting for Biden vote in person! Most states have in person early voting for at least 3 weeks before Election Day! Plan to wait, wear and mask and socially distance! Trump has made it clear he will contest mail in ballots cast for Biden!
He will and we will forgive him because it is bigger than Biden. The current occupant of the White House is an existential threat.

You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.

Absolutely! And part of the classification problem is that Democrats are the only reasonable major US party at the moment (in an infuriatingly condescending way), so they attract more people under that umbrella than any 1 ideology. It's the party of both AOC and Biden.
Let's see ... the neoliberal center-left political philosophy of Clinton-Obama-Clinton (and Biden) lifted billions out of poverty and extended the reach of liberal democratic institutions well into central, and even eastern, Europe.    Now we can't even go to Canada.

Hillary was, and yeah it's an opinion, just because it's an opinion doesn't completely negate it. I believe Biden is smarter because at least he listens to statistics and science and all that.
i dont know what evidence is there to suggest that trump is gonna win. biden is winng almost every swing state by almost 5 points. even texas is considered a swing state, and trump clearly isnt even gonna pretend to be a good president to win reelection.

im in texas and im not gonna vite for biden. if that leads to texas going to trump then so be it.
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.

Most people aren't, also just so you know I don't watch CNN or like Biden, he's an old racist pedo who isn't fit to serve this country. Personally, I've met at least 18 racist republicans, and 0 racist dems. Personal experience means nothing in a discussion like this.
There's actually no US candidates that have a socialist platform. The US is a heavily right leaning country, compared to any other country, Biden would be considered right leaning and bernie even would be a moderate left.

She was supposed to show remorse for her remarks in the debate? She was practically angelic compared to other attack dogs in debates. Experienced politicians know all's fair in this game. Warren was at least as aggressive as Harris. Biden gets it. This is a non-story.

if biden becomes president he will be blamed for the aftermath of corona virus. just like how they blamed obama for the horrible economy bush gave him.
It is when he thanks the people in the video.  If it had been Biden, or any other Democrat in that scenario, I'd believe the same.
The Dems love COVID. Trump filling football stadiums with his ralleys was a real problem. Especially when Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a cafe. Make no mistake, those that want to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday Americans must get rid of Trump.
This is symbolic of a Biden presidency. He will remain in the basement as his shadow government drafts and legislates new policy‚Äôs that will crush the American Economy.
Also weird that you want to talk about jobs? How are those unemployment numbers looking? Joe Biden never had the GDP drop over 30% in one quarter. Come to think of it nobody has, since the record has been kept.
You all scoffed when Biden (correctly) predicted that Trump might try to delay the election.  He's alleged widespread voter fraud, with zero evidence in the 2016 popular vote.  He's alleged that voting by mail is subject to widespread fraud. /1
If Biden picks Karen Bass as  VP, it is like Hindenburg picking Hitler as chancellor.

This did not happen overnight.." Of course not !! The DEMOCRATS planned it well ahead...just like they did the Floyd case to generate violence. In view of Biden's condition, I wonder what they are planning to postpone the presidential DEBATES and possibly the election too...
Biden has said in media that he sees himself as a transitional President, so I hope whomever he picks has their eye on the Presidency, as they'd be groomed and listed as the presumptive nominee. This is people getting upset someone who won't back down is getting the VP spot.

This is true, because a) #Biden will let millions of illegals come; b) The entire USA will look like #democrat-run cities like Portland, NYC, Chicago c) There won't be police to protect you after #DefundThePolice d) You won't be able to protect yourself when they take your guns.

Hey who‚Äôs up for a swim with Joe Biden? He‚Äôll probably let you sit on his lap and if you‚Äôre lucky, stroke his leg hairs!!  Anyone??
They need to opening up a hearing on the Biden leaks that only days after the raid, he starts bragging even though they had a pact with situation room. What a traitor. Ill side with the Seals father.
one word name
Biden don't even know what day or the week it is, so why would we expect anything more running a country?  Scary
MSM knows there are no longer so-called suburbs, they were eliminated by Obama/Biden bills, called the affordable .....
Thank you VP Biden I got retested 4 Covid19 bc I've been quarantined 4 14 days and I got my results back and I tested positive again this virus has been awful I've been off from work 4 a whole month now so I'm hoping soon I get better and help is on the way 4 me God will provide
Biden forgot

I agree, and have read last year on charisma, that satan will use the Democrats to destroy this nation.Especially if Joe Biden is elected into the White House.
If you vote for Biden you vote for abortion.
Biden is a coward
Hallelujah!  In that case I‚Äôm definitely voting for Joe Biden because I absolutely do not want wannabe dictator trump‚Äôs version of America.
Hmmm this from the moron who told people to drink bleach to kill the virus. A real stable genius. I don‚Äôt think you want to go there with Biden...you will lose that battle.

What's the Biden plan Trump claims would "destroy" suburbs?  #FoxBusiness If You Vote Democratic Party In November the Suburbs as we know it will be destroyed!
Need to do a little more research bud on those who blasted the travel ban and promoted socializing while it was spreading. That would be Biden and Pelosi.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD trump IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You do realize that #Trump was the president who signed the First Step Act that Clinton/Biden and #democrats made, which eliminated 3 strikes and freed many minorities from unfair sentences, giving them a second chance in life?
TIME TRAVEL IS REAL!! On May 31, 2017 President Biden visited from the future to warn about the pandemic.  Unfortunately, you know who, just wasn‚Äôt a good note taker.
please god don‚Äôt write him in for fun. he will not win and then biden won‚Äôt y‚Äôall rlly want that again?
Unlike the massive Biden rallies huh?
They both are racist on some level.  The problem is that Biden‚Äôs tax policies alone will crush our economy when we are in need the exact opposite coming out of Covid.  That will have more of an impact on our day-to-day life.
Joe Biden is running from what he hasn‚Äôt accomplished. So wrong for so long Joe.

I'm shocked that Cruz Isn't supporting Biden. But then I remembered.. Republicans   #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden all the way. Don is a lunatic!
I have not seen ANYONE with Biden flags, bumper stickers or anything. At least over here in Texas there's mostly #Trump2020 in my neighborhood.
Are the (good) citizens of Portland ignorant or uninformed of "antifa" rioters taking over their city? If Biden wins in November , they are not going away...
1/2 Been struggling with this. I want Biden to just undo everything Trump did. But that is what Trump did in re Obama. What I don't want is for every time we switch parties in control, they just go through and undo the previous admin's actions.
said it best-name a policy that Biden FIGHTS to keep MODERATE.  #crickets  Everyone keeps saying he is moderate, but the only thing moderate about Joe's policies is the font size.
Biden is a Godless Asshole.
He will still crush Biden, anytime.
The polls are probably BS but if anyone on here takes for granted the stupidity of most Americans or the ones that are just tired of Trumps tweets and won‚Äôt vote period you do so at your own peril!  Biden can and will win if conservatives or independents take this for granted!
Compared to any Liberal, Biden, we have no choice. A bad conservative is better than any great lib. We can‚Äôt afford a lib SCJ, more handouts, less America first, etc etc etc. my answer is, the country can‚Äôt afford anything liberal.
You live in America right? Then he is your president. Just like if Biden wins, he‚Äôll be my president. Stop being a baby about all this. And stop confirming to the Left‚Äôs ideologies. They make up rumors about Trump to make him looks bad. Start doing research yourself! God bless!
Straight to Biden, to China and then back to Biden, it's all the same.
I honsstly have no idea whag your point is besides a vote for anyone beside Biden is helping Trump.

Yes, I understand Biden was the VP back when he could put a sentence together.  Not sure what your point is, I will not vote for him.

this isn‚Äôt biden‚Äôs fault. i‚Äôm pretty sure he don‚Äôt even know it‚Äôs happening lol it‚Äôs whoever is allowing this to happens fault.
Fake, I live in the same area, Trump 2020 signs everywhere. I drive to med center everyday and I have not seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker!
Biden is now a ‚Äúcardboard cutout‚Äù !  God help our country since Her citizens are now too preoccupied to help ourselves.
biden would only be responsible if he didn‚Äôt have NG ready in case state governors called for help. imo, trump has taken too long on some things so maybe he is at fault. i just know y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt like me as president. i‚Äôd put all these assholes in prison.Right now, I‚Äôm participating in a grassroots fundraiser with Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.  They make a good team.  If she‚Äôs not the VP pick, I hope she‚Äôs his Secretary of the Treasury.
Same. I‚Äôm gonna be lit for a week if Biden wins.
It is when he thanks the people in the video.  If it had been Biden, or any other Democrat in that scenario, I'd believe the same.
Whomever is saying this in Biden‚Äôs camp is not serving Biden. Dismantling sexism and racism requires new thinking not this tired crap.
The Dems love COVID. Trump filling football stadiums with his ralleys was a real problem. Especially when Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a cafe. Make no mistake, those that want to enrich themselves at the expense of everyday Americans must get rid of Trump.
This is symbolic of a Biden presidency. He will remain in the basement as his shadow government drafts and legislates new policy‚Äôs that will crush the American Economy.
Also weird that you want to talk about jobs? How are those unemployment numbers looking? Joe Biden never had the GDP drop over 30% in one quarter. Come to think of it nobody has, since the record has been kept.
You all scoffed when Biden (correctly) predicted that Trump might try to delay the election.  He's alleged widespread voter fraud, with zero evidence in the 2016 popular vote.  He's alleged that voting by mail is subject to widespread fraud. /1
If Biden picks Karen Bass as  VP, it is like Hindenburg picking Hitler as chancellor.
I just listened to your podcast with Rita.  It was great!  I‚Äôm a 65 yr old white woman who will be voting for Joe Biden.
Mr. Biden, my suggestion and professional advice is to avoid Twitter and all social media when in office. If you want to connect with people just do more briefings or a simple 5 min podcast
I hope she doesn‚Äôt but she did already endorse Biden.

i‚Äôm joe biden and i forgot this message
So many people have sour grapes about Biden being the nominee. They are attacking Kamala Harris and trying to minimize her in several ways. I am  just over it!
If you‚Äôre trying to pull in votes for Biden the way you moved up then you better get a helmet ‚õë.  I hear headboards can cause brain damage.
If Biden can‚Äôt debate in person then delay the election! Social media companies are ready to doctor all the Biden events to make him look like he knows what‚Äôs going on. He is not fit for office at all. He should help Hunter spend their I‚Äôll gotten gains.
Your desperate attempts to find national relevance are pathetic.  You and your buddy Newsom must be rip shit pissed that neither of you are on Biden‚Äôs VP search committee, but Garcetti is!!!

So what if she does.  Each VP candidate should be focused on being president, especially when the President is so old. Joe Biden himself was a VP who ran for President (pre and post). Why the double standard?
We should all start to ask that question.  Where is Hunter Biden?
Have any of you listened and watched stuff  your presumptive nominee does and says??   Y‚Äôall know good and well, as does  that he can‚Äôt delay the election.
Scared of Biden? You should be! 151,000 + American deaths on your watch!  The only way you‚Äôd win this election is if you cheat!
This same fate is coming your way if BLM, Antifa, Biden, Pelosi and Schumer take control in Nov. Dissent will be silenced with total destruction of your property and death.  VOTE ACCORDINGLY
The idea that republicans will play nice with a biden administration ‚Äî that this is just a trump issue not a republican one ‚Äî needs to be shot into the sun immediately. This is a prime example of that, because he will absolutely have republican support.

You don't understand Marxism OR socialism if you think Biden has embraced anything of the sort. It's really past time that Republican/right wingers educate themselves on definitions and philosophies of the words and types of govts they spew from their mouths.
Those of you who are bystanders and cheerleaders of trump's corruption should make your break now.  Endorse Biden.  Change your legacies from "complicit traitors and criminals" to "merely useful idiots".  It's too late for the ringleaders.
Cool  now do Biden/China.

This is classic flawed thinking. Tax cut for the rich by trump A ok. Spending by Trump irresponsible but A ok compared to Dems bc one example of them wanting to spend more. Nevermind that Biden is on record he will roll back tax cuts on the rich and balance the budget.
Biden won‚Äôt remember these points tomorrow.
Then they‚Äôd have to FIRST prove to a court that the FISA was improperly filed, and get a positive ruling on that,and then they‚Äôd have to further prove that Obama/ Biden KNEW it was, and ALSO prove that there was ‚Äúspying‚Äù on the Trump campaign at all. Not enough time for all that
What is disgusting, is a man with a spray tan whining about about ramps being too slick for his leather souls or spilling water on a silk tie, amidst a PANDEMIC!. BIDEN / DEMINGS. 20/20!
But was he able to correctly identify the elephant?   Did Biden claim that windmills cause cancer?   Or that the Revolutionary Army took the airports?   Or claim that journalists should have to return their "Noble" prize, which was so named for noble behavior?   Etc., etc.
Sounds like it will be some kind of Joe Biden/Hunter Biden ludicrous lie....and the Trumpers will be ready to believe it, of course, but will anyone else?
Anyone listen to Biden make promises for his administration and wonder why none of it was accomplished as VP for 8 years?  None.... it's all pandering and more lies. Smh

He could go to the Capitol rotunda and pay his respects.  VP Joe Biden did.  There was no one there other than the guards.  If Trump can golf, he can pay his respects to a hero of the Civil Rights movement.
How in the world can you embrace Joe Biden who caused the murders of the SEAL team in Afghanistan by his treasonous act of revealing info that outed this group.  That just shows what an opportunist you are and that you are a racist and bias against the U.S.

Without proper education weights, result would have been Biden +23ish. UNH had Hillary up 48-38 without weighting. If they had weighted, would have shown Hillary 43-41 -- much closer to actual results. Goes to show how much education played into polling errors in 2016.

ONE DEMOCRAT EVEN ASKED BARR IF HE WOULD PROMISE TO POSTPONE THE DURHAM REPORT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  Dems. are cowards and don't want the DURHAM report out before the election because it would be damaging to OBAMA/BIDEN and their administration. Pay backs are a real bitch.üôä
All these leaks are bad for her prospects...Even if Biden was gonna pick her, he almost can‚Äôt now...What would that say about his campaign if they couldn‚Äôt keep this most important decision under wraps??!
I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.

Republicans literally make the same argument that a third party vote is a vote for Biden. So who is it for?? I don't think we could realistically vote our way out of a two party system without getting rid of first past the post so I don't see the point in voting third party.
Yep. Would love to know when a president Biden would have thought to close travel to China, for example.

Biden is a unsympathetic politician who will use this opportunity (John Lewis death) to rack up the black vote.  Back in the 80' &amp; 90's  Biden's vision was to lock up blacks. Also, Biden didnt want black children going to school where his kids attended. All documentation on line.

Harris is perfect on paper, the Q is whether Jill has forgiven her for the debate thing/Joe thinks they are sympatico.   It's clear he's modeling search on Obama's, natch, and Obama famously passed on Evan Bayh (the better on paper candidate) for Biden due to personality fit.
I concur. Portnoy did a great job without the sneaky gotcha BS that ‚Äúreal journalists‚Äù now rely on.  Trump needs more interviews like this and Biden needs to sit down with
biggest problem with attacking Biden is that Trump has no integrity, scruples, or character. Therefore, Trump has no credibility when it comes to judging another person‚Äôs integrity, scruples, or character.

Joe Biden lies about everything
New York, New Jersey, Mass: All D states who have death tolls over 1000 per million.  Texas, Florida, Arizona? Still under 200 per million and new cases are plateauing.   The media care more about Nov. 8 2020 going to Biden then they do honest journalism. We already knew that tho
Dropping a lawsuit doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt happen. The woman was getting death threats. That‚Äôs why she dropped the lawsuit. That doesn‚Äôt mean she wasn‚Äôt raped.
let's talk about health care shall we? The Americans who lost their jobs and have no health care insurance. And, Americans who can not afford the insurance.... These people will soon die due to their existing health conditions. Let's talk about that. Joe Biden is trying to help.

Joe Biden‚Äôs crime bill is checking you out this very instant!
Tell that to the horse that constantly tells people to vote for the other horse when his policies are questioned.  Biden makes himself look bad. Pointing that out is just highlighting the damage he did to himself already.
Joe Biden is effectively shutting down that debate. He's not interested in single-payer at all. He's said so in so many words.  How the hell is calling him out on that "bad faith"? Your statements are more bad faith than Bri's.

Saw it. You don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm level of Biden when you read from the teleprompter. But I suppose it‚Äôs the only way to prevent you for sabotaging your own campaign.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.

No sane person would vote for Biden
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Don't ask that question homie... you know you only asked that because you feel guilty for getting paid by Biden and the Clinton/Obama administration
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
Are you trying to lose? All Biden has to do is saying nothing, and his numbers go up
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
Possibility 1; Biden is elected with Hillary Clinton as his V.P. and the Speaker of the House, Pelosi pushes the 25th amendment to rid the country of Biden and ...TA DA.. Hillary becomes President.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
Absolutely not, idgaf if you win, Biden wins, or Mickey Mouse wins, get this shit over with

As much as Dems like to use this excuse every 4 years, it doesn't work.  Pick the right guy that supports the right policies and you'll see the left flock together. Picking Biden was specifically picking outside the left demographic.  Go bark up the right's tree.
With all due respect to Joe Biden, this country is well past the point where unity is possible. Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi together couldn‚Äôt do that.   The best we can hope for is to avoid another Civil War.

He could wind up on Biden's short list for HHS Secretary
Did you expect them to approve it when the candidate who supported it lost to the one who didn‚Äôt? Like I get being annoyed but why would you be surprised, more Democrats support Biden than Bernie so obviously the party wouldn‚Äôt put M4A on the platform.

Biden is such a complete Fruit Loop Reade's allegations won't be the deciding factor in the election. They are certainly the most important thing to her but I think the Statute of limitations have run out on Criminal proceedings but someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
If the question is whether or not she is going to kiss Biden's ass, well the answer  is hell no. Will she do her job and work her ass off, yes she will.   America is a misogynist and racist country and what's happening to Kamala is really bad. The Democratic party is failing her.
People privileged enough to survive a Biden/Kamala presidency calling people not privileged enough to survive either privileged    That‚Äôs some inception shit

It would be interesting to have a member of the House as VP. I like all of them. I want whoever can help Biden win. The rest can also help and continue to do whatever job they were doing.
Did anyone ask if Biden would be disloyal to Obama?  Didn‚Äôt think so
Yes, more than now. Communists will not stop if Biden wins. If they have a president that supports their violence, they will do it more.
Welp, Biden will kiss her Bass goodbye. Or not. It's 2020, who the hell knows?
There is no perfect candidate. She has had to work with the system she inherited. As VP she would be an excellent person to reform policing, esp with her social work background. Biden has a great final list. Would be delighted with any of them. #Biden2020
It doesn't matter who the Democratic Candidate is they will always find something to bitch about.  For the mess we are in right now, Biden is perfect to make this horrendous experiment of Anti-Democracy go away.  Sign way any of the Trump ignorance &amp; right this ship.
No it was NOT! His administration actually admitted ‚Äúthey got lucky‚Äù. They also never replenished the needed stockpiles of PPE &amp; equipment they used. Obama/Biden- worst administration EVER.
I have wanted Kamala Harris from the get go. I was very interested in her as a Presidential candidate. In the end, I will vote for the ticket no matter who Joe Biden picks. They all have pluses and minuses.
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!
My advice is everyone voting for Biden vote in person! Most states have in person early voting for at least 3 weeks before Election Day! Plan to wait, wear and mask and socially distance! Trump has made it clear he will contest mail in ballots cast for Biden!
Seriously, I will be so much calmer when I never have to hear  voice ever, ever again. And I pray on inauguration day, he just takes a pass and leaves before Biden is sworn in. The less I see of him, the better.
He will and we will forgive him because it is bigger than Biden. The current occupant of the White House is an existential threat.

We now know that Biden was prescient, accessing information about things before they happened.
And you think Biden is more coherent? Hell the main reason I am voting for Trump again is because Biden can‚Äôt put two coherent sentences together. It‚Äôs basically a choice of the lesser of two evils
To bad he won't be around to see it.  The votes will be tallied on electon night and only states that are too close to call may run over a day or two. When Biden wins he will be removed from office on January 20, 2021. His lawsuit won't do him any good.
My totally Novice Q is, Since Biden is being briefed on ‚Äúthings‚Äù would he or would he not be obtaining briefs on such materials especially since it includes a questionable at best member of Intel Commity? And involvement in impeachment hearing clown show??

Biden is trying to befriend all radical groups
Absolutely! And part of the classification problem is that Democrats are the only reasonable major US party at the moment (in an infuriatingly condescending way), so they attract more people under that umbrella than any 1 ideology. It's the party of both AOC and Biden.
We need more voting facilities &amp; booths across America! No mail-in-ballots because if this happens Biden will win!
Sleazy former President Obama flames racial tension to try to win Presidential election for Biden! He is disgusting!

I agreed. Delay until Biden is ready to come out of his basement.... basically forever
How many Biden signs or banners have you seen?  Nobody really is passionate about him so if it takes any effort to vote a lot of people won‚Äôt do it.  Whereas Trump supporters would hike across hot coals to vote for him.

I gotta go but we have different views. I support good debate. I myself hope Biden wins, I know you're pulling for Trump so we can check back in Nov 4 to see what happens!
We do know Russia worked on Behalf of President Trump. That is fact. We also Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Biden which is against the law in our constitution the same one you just said shouldn't be changed. You can't have it both ways, either document matters or it doesn't.
OHHHH!!! I was wondering. I haven‚Äôt read the article but let‚Äôs remember folks: Beto AND Kamala stayed for Biden‚Äôs rally here in Dallas. Mayor Pete? He met w/ him before, endorses him &amp; left. It‚Äôs been Beto all along gin up the TX Dems for Joe!! He‚Äôs campaigning daily to flip TX!
One of us will be right on Nov 4th and one of us will be sad. I like my chances of a Biden Presidency and a Dem controlled House and Senate so we will see.
And again, seeing there are 40m unemployed. 2m+ postitve COVID-19 cases, 160k dead, and worse ression since the 1920s - Joe Biden is a upgrade over President Trump. And as I mentioned, the polls say Americans agree.
Well he did lose by 1.5million votes so the polls where correct. They also correctly predicted 2018 and Dems actually outpformed what polls suggested so taking 2018 into account, I'm very optimistic Biden will be President.
And that's why you hire compentnet people to put around him vs President Trump whos had one of the worse administratives in America history. A President is a figure head - again I'm optimistic Biden will win. NOV 3rd.
In 2016 polls where correct. Clinton won the popular vote. Polls however do not poll for the Electoral College. President Trump won the EC by a total of 77k votes. Now we have a 4 yr record to judge, Biden is more likable and is pulling 12% Republicans in polls. I'm optimistic.
Secretly they are hoping Biden wins. May even vote for him just so they can escape the madness that is Donald Trump.  Of course they won't admit it. Of course by lying, they are sort of shoveling the dirt into the hole.
Well an opinion is just that an opinion. Mine is that Biden is 1000x better than President Trump and so far the people polled seem to agree so we will see.
I‚Äôm not saying they are great. I know that Obama was the Deporter in chief. I‚Äôm just saying that trump truly just wants us out of here sooner than Obama/Biden ever did. And if you are happy with this 4 yr and how trump does business then, I guess you deserve trump as a president.

Maybe it's just taking a while to get all of the charges in order before the targeted people are rounded up.  Regardless, something needs to be done soon.  It would be a dereliction of duty and devastating if it's not done and the unthinkable happens-Biden wins.
Really sad. Wouldn‚Äôt wish what Biden has on anyone.
Just so you know, I am Ridin with Biden and even though Collin County is going red, I am still casting my vote for Joe. So don't lump me in with Bernie or Busters, I just think you had a bad take about how the convention is supposed to work.
...M4A Super Delegates to pressure the DNC to add M4A to the party platform. You do understand that Biden and Warren and other delegates would've argued that M4A shoudn't be the party platform if Bernie was the presumptive nominee, right?
I am disappointed in your take on the delegates signing a pledge that they will not vote for the party platform unless Medicare For All is part of the party platform. You argue that we are going to bully Biden the moment he gets into office, but the whole point...
Has ‚ÄòNo Remorse‚Äô For Ambushing  In Primary Debates
Its Biden trying to keep you down and silenced
That's a great question. The Biden campaign better get their shit together because not picking the most qualified woman in Kamala Harris is not going to end well. Black women work too hard for this party to be put on the sideline. Chris Dodd needs to be put on the sidelines.
Did ya' think Biden would have anything good to say 'bout it?
Biden has so much baggage  I don‚Äôt want to be mean  But when ‚Äú  IT ‚Äúhits the fan, all the corruption will be ugly.    Who gets millions from foreign countries?   Politicians, do
Conservatives do not reply to polls, therefore the numbers could be over inflated! We all need to vote! Biden 2020
Dude, where have you been?  Trump is trying to open schools and Biden and Dems want them closed.  What do you not get?

I think you mean if Biden wins in November. There's still the threat of China Russia or even Iran hacking the election and we CANNOT MUST NOT get complacent
One advantage that ‚Äòwomen of color‚Äô have, is that they don‚Äôt have Joe Biden sniffing them. Isn‚Äôt ‚Äòracially selective sniffing‚Äô, considered #racist?
This is JMO but if Biden wins then y‚Äôall will lose all of your leverage. Dems will grant statehood to DC &amp; Costa Rica, abolish the filibuster, and incentivize immigration  by granting them access to welfare programs. They won‚Äôt need your votes when immigrants outnumber y‚Äôall 2:1
Guess we‚Äôll add his name to the pile of unqualified ppl w/in this horrifying administration. He gets bonus points for being a freak! Biden‚Äôs administration is going to be mighty busy repairing the damage done to our reputation around the world.
Of course.  Anything to keep Biden from speaking. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

The people supporting Bernie would have to settle for Biden, also there is no radical left in America, Bernie is a moderate leftist and a democratic socialist not a socialist. Biden himself is even right leaning, definitely not "radical left"
So Chris Wallace again asking Trump if he would accept the results of the election did not comfort Biden enough to face the paper lion huh?
What if Biden and the liberals don‚Äôt accept 2020 election results?
I‚Äôm sorry for asking, Brian...but who is Joe Biden?
Part of the "Vote for Biden or Else!" Campaign
Because the media tells them to vote for Biden.  They cant see the propaganda against Trump.  And then some love what the left stands for.  We live in a terrible world that will only get worse.
She‚Äôs right if Biden wins we‚Äôre gonna be living in a Nazi socialist country where they tell us what to do how to do it and when to do it so I can see her point
I‚Äôm trying to convince my parents that they need to vote for Biden. I‚Äôm hoping they will see the light.
Biden covers his mouth out of necessity- to mask his blunders &amp; loss of mental capability. Masks are not needed when outside. Virus dies w/i 15-20 seconds when exposed to ultraviolet rays.
Joe Biden can not RISK an interview, or a debate‚úîÔ∏è

Malarkey was a key factor in 1920, so it's in the model, but only in states east of the Mississippi with governors that have at least one S in their last name. This pushes Florida 0.03% towards Biden now, but 0.05% if he goes harder into pro-malarkey after the convention.

Let‚Äôs do this people! Joe Biden is the leader  we need to save us!!
I have a feeling no one who is holding their nose and voting for Biden is going to actually care.
The supposed "miracle" of a vaccine can in no way make up for his inexcusable punting of mitigating this pandemic when he had the chance to do so. Sorry not sorry but I will be voting for Joe Biden in November.
This is only one of the many reasons why I will be voting for Joe Biden in November. I hope you will do the same.
True! DONT FALL FOR THE BIDEN LIES! He is a China puppet &amp; will turn America into a socialist nation! üî¥üîµVOTE TRUMP üî¥üîµfor a safe, prosperous nation
A "Biden blowout-" you mean an explosion in his basement?  That's the only kind of blowout he's gonna get!  PS- aren't you supposed to be masquerading as a "conservative?" FAIL!
Joe Biden better listen to Black Women. If it ain‚Äôt KDH, then he ain‚Äôt listening!
‚ÄúEnthusiasm‚Äù in this instance though means certifiably insane, so, not exactly anything to brag about. Notice the difference between a Price is Right contestant and a Jeopardy contestant. Those of us voting for Biden are more like Jeopardy contestants.Completely agree, YS. This will be a huge problem for Biden if he picks a Scientologist to be his VP.  I do wonder why this is just coming out now, though.
Where? What photos?!? You can‚Äôt just turn this into a ‚Äúlook at Biden‚Äù thing to distract from Trumps pedophilia! Biden was not photographed on at least 60 occasions or more with sexual predators! Give me a break!
Nope. This is exactly why Biden should not have said he was going to pick a woman. Every racist and sexist mofo in the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù media and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Twitter are showing their ü©≤
Not bashing Bass. I refuse to drag a woman of color that is up for VP   But üëáüèæ may be a problem for Biden‚Äôs core base, black church women. Some may see Scientology as too fringe. They are not as feral about mixing faith &amp; politics as white evangelicals, but faith does play a part
I know you'll help get us out of this COVID-19 mess VP Joe Biden soon to be President Joe Biden.
With the way 2020 has gone so far, do we really know who the Presidential candidate for each party will be? What's to say that either or both Trump and Biden have colossal physical or mental breakdowns.
why did you like this comment omg
Eeeew any one who talks about another human like that is a predator no matter the gender
I couldn‚Äôt finish listening to that omg
Biden doesn't even know where he is most the time so sure!!
No one is gonna vote for him anyway! Biden wouldn't last another yr
You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.
Coronavirus US: Fauci appears at house hearing on virus 'raging out of control' ‚Äì live
If you are a Republican and think Trump is a loser or a liar, do not vote for him. You do not have to vote for Joe Biden. That may be asking too much. Salvage some of your dignity.
Biden spoke for organization founded and led by Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas operatives
No Biden sticker on it so very doubtful
Let's see ... the neoliberal center-left political philosophy of Clinton-Obama-Clinton (and Biden) lifted billions out of poverty and extended the reach of liberal democratic institutions well into central, and even eastern, Europe.    Now we can't even go to Canada.
So Biden could become the second. He speaks Jibberish. That counts right?
Hillary was, and yeah it's an opinion, just because it's an opinion doesn't completely negate it. I believe Biden is smarter because at least he listens to statistics and science and all that.
I'll be sure to let all of these people your targeting g know what your doing. Your fake ppl with no lives that do this. Its freedom to say what you want on here. Wait a sec, its not, twitter is a biden biased company
We dont want Joe Biden as President. They are both crooks. One has be3n around for 50 yrs and hasnt done shit for the American people. All of a sudden a new guy comes along that knows everything about all the Democrats and now the democrats are squirming!! Obama is Satanic
I agree with everything you just said except, for me, replace Warren w/Beto.  I have been arguing this point the minute Biden won SC  Outside of cable media &amp; woke Twitter most people do not care if Biden picks Harley Quinn.  Most just want that Apocalyptic Apricot AntiChrist out
I think Biden could win the debate. He's at least slightly smarter than Trump, and has better positions. That doesn't really help that much in a debate, but he's not scared of Trump, which is why Hillary lost.
Did  Biden have sex with a cousin?  YES / NO
The test he took was a dementia test, and said the questions about months was the hardest... Trump has an equal amount of scandals. Just know, I hate Biden just as much as you do if not more, both are horrible for the country and all around horrible people.
Yeah, Biden will be able to handle it though cause he's not scared of Trump. Biden doesn't have dementia, that's been proven, Trump however admitted to struggling on a dementia test.
Neither can Trump, at least Biden has an actual excuse, he has a speech impediment. Trump on the other hand has none.
Not just sexism. I haven‚Äôt read about Warren and Kloubachar too ‚Äúambitious‚Äù for Biden to pick as VP.
I promise you that climate change is not going to be solved under Biden
I love the passion of this physician. I cannot believe how disrespectful our main stream news media speaks of her, including Joe Biden. Seems racist.
Haven‚Äôt seen a Biden sign but I have seen a few ‚ÄúAny Functioning Adult: 2020‚Äù signs.
There is not one SANE black woman, whether they are Skateboards, KHive, Petedctyls, Latter Day Lizzies, No Malarkies,Kloubacharians, Castrations, Gang of Yang, or Booker Tees (Branch Bernardians are not sane), will be hurt or pissed if Biden chooses a qualified black woman or WOC
This is a false equivalence, Sis. For one thing, there is not one SANE black woman who will be pissed or hurt if Biden picks another black woman or a WOC(except, maybe black Latter Day Lizzies, and even with them, I am not comfortable making them an exception)
Doubt it.. What does Biden have to offer other than a rambling Incoherent babble?
I believe there is a good chance Democrats net the 3 seats they need (with a Biden win).    Nuking the filibuster isn't necessary.
Trump until the Dems can figure out a quality candidate. Biden and Hillary are trash

So excited for Joe Biden to make America imperialist again!
Biden is simply old... you just do things a bit   s l o w e r  that's all... He's still sharp, will put qualified people in place, is a good man, and will do the right thing. BEST argument for Biden? WE have no choice. Period.
Love is in the air. Joe Biden really loves his grandchildren.
I believe Biden is being led by the arm, without a mask, without having been tested for COVID-19, from a room with many unmasked people. I think this is his granddaughter who he kisses on the lips frequently.
And that is the scary part! People planning to vote for Biden have no idea who will really be running the country. Biden‚Äôs handlers would be able to do as they please without repercussions.
To win, Biden just needs for Trump to give ‚Äòpress conferences‚Äô Everything Trump touches dies
Evidently white women is a no go for Joe Biden!! His racist ass needs those black votes!! Remember!! Yoy ain't black unless you vote for Joe Biden!! Well!! I ain't black!!
Yeah, cuz their white! He needs his black voters which is pathetic because ppl are gonna vote for whoever they want. They don't need ppl telling them they ain't black if they don't vote for Joe biden, but why would a racist say that I wonder? Oh, for votes!!
I‚Äôm not going to guess what Biden‚Äôs notes mean for who he will pick as VP. But if you‚Äôre looking for differences in the candidates‚Äô mental capacity, let‚Äôs look at what their notes look like.
No, this is the DEMOCRATS playing games. They are desperate!! Notice how no one is talking  any kinds of shit about Biden?? 40 yrs in office and never done shit!! Lmao
#CBS seriously asking if there's an enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden! Ya think?
A Few of the Democrats Biden Missed When He Called Trump Our First Racist President
Poll: Who is more intelligent? Joe Biden or Patrick from Spongebob?
Absolutely NOT! Riden with Biden
TX have 2 popular Dems  w/strong NATIONAL bases. One was in Obama‚Äôs Cabinet. The other,in 2018, received the most votes for a Dem in TX history  How the FUCK could an obscure media created mayor from a town smaller than Trophy Club, can help Biden flip TX?
Remember when Kamala called Biden a racist in the debates? Good times.
Watch the movie Dave. Biden is already incapacitated and the Democrats are handling his campaign thanks to the virus. ü§™
Biden at 77 years old will be 81 during the ‚Äò24 campaign.  IMHO, he won‚Äôt run for re-election.   Warren at 71 will be 75, at most she would also be a one term successor.    Harris &amp; Rice are both 55, each has an easy 12 years in front of them.   #1 Harris #2 Rice
If Biden takes Florida ( highly likely if the election was held today ) then PA won‚Äôt matter. Michigan either. The landscape is totally different this year.
Sniffy Joe can't pick his own breakfast
No, this will allow China to be the world dominant by 2030 if Biden wins!
The kids are too fucking stupid these days. They will just keep using it. They don't care. They just want to watch each other eat tide pods!! Pretty much sums up Biden fans too
I get why Biden voters act so weird now!! Their not from America! It makes sense
Their both crooked as hell!! Ones been there 3.5 yrs, the other one has been there for 40 plus years!! Now, common sense tells you one thing!! Dude has not done shit!! In 40 yrs. I dont care what Trump has done. Save our country!! Dont give it to the Chinese like biden wants!
Calm down, please Just because a person doesn‚Äôt agree 100% doesn‚Äôt mean they are dumb or need to leave
This Democrat is voting Red!!! Blood red too!! I mean Red cuz if your voting for Biden, you voting to become like China! Facts. Dems never did anything but legalize weed. Bout it!! Oh and Gay b.s
I've notice. Biden Voters are fucking weird. I almost wonder how many real accts there actually are
He should just fill out his whole Cabinet with anyone he doesn't pick for VP. I know other people have said it, but I think that would be an excellent campaign strategy. Give voters three months to compare a Biden Cabinet to the #CorruptTrumpCabinet and see who voters pick!
Most people aren't, also just so you know I don't watch CNN or like Biden, he's an old racist pedo who isn't fit to serve this country. Personally, I've met at least 18 racist republicans, and 0 racist dems. Personal experience means nothing in a discussion like this.
There's actually no US candidates that have a socialist platform. The US is a heavily right leaning country, compared to any other country, Biden would be considered right leaning and bernie even would be a moderate left.
Biden doesn't have dementia, but when Trump took the dementia test he said that the hardest part was talking about the months...
Trump retweeting Russian trolls. How typical. Can't wait til November. Biden will work to help Americans rather than tweet Putin propaganda.
Please ask  if he will be helping Joe Biden with debate prep, or if he has been supplanted by Alec Baldwin. :-)
It‚Äôs my kind of town! Votes Biden 2020.
I DONT CARE WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE!! BIDEN IS TOAST
Results are in: the majority of Americans aren't republican, Hillary got more votes but Trump only won because of the electoral college. Also there's no far left candidates, Bernie was one of the only moderate left ones, and Biden is right leaning
Biden is a very very weak Presidental candidate
Of course Talib will not endorse Biden. She needs Confederate Caligula and Trumpfederates in the media to keep her useless ass relevant  Talib is the nastiest, the most intolerable, bitter, and useless  of Squadders. She‚Äôs like the üëáüèæ of (AOC)Josie and the Pussycats
What makes the media so fucking egregious is that they use Kamala &amp; Beto as shitstools and an ‚Äúexample‚Äù to promote two of the most overrated racially insensitive frauds in the party  And they won‚Äôt stop until Warrigieg split DNA to become Evita and Juan
She was supposed to show remorse for her remarks in the debate? She was practically angelic compared to other attack dogs in debates. Experienced politicians know all's fair in this game. Warren was at least as aggressive as Harris. Biden gets it. This is a non-story.
Still don't care!! Ex Democrat!! Biden and them can't win!! All will go to hell!! Sew how China is!! Thats how America will turn!! Mark my words
Its funny how much biden voters don't know what's next!! They dont call him China Joe for nothing
BIDEN IS TOAST!! #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDE
Well just create diversity and well get all of the #BLMTerrorists and #lgtbqterroists to vote for Joe!! That aught to get biden in the White house even though he's been there for 40 yrs and hasn't done a thing üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉü§£ü§£ü§£
This November he sure will be!! He will go from V.p of 1st term to V.p of 2nd term!!! If you don't vote for Trump your doing nothing, but harm!! China Joe Biden and the Dems want to ruin America like Obama did!! Its all about money. I use to hate Grump too!! Ex dem

The people supporting Bernie would have to settle for Biden, also there is no radical left in America, Bernie is a moderate leftist and a democratic socialist not a socialist. Biden himself is even right leaning, definitely not "radical left"
#Trump2020 If you vote for China Joe Biden you are voting for China to become the next world dominant leader by 2030!! You dont realize that do you???!!!! Do your homework. The Democrats are evil and want to divide this Country!! Pls do your home work. The media lies!!
So I saw this sign pop up in my neighbors yard, they are strong rep and out of town .I texted them and someone put it on their lawn as a prank so of course I asked if I can have it .. so now I‚Äôm proudly displaying my Biden sign that was paid for by a Republican... feels so good.
If you want China to be the World Dominant country by 2030!! Vote Joe China Biden!! Mark my words! The Democrats are not for America. They are for a different Agenda! I will never vote democratic again! I dont care what Trump did. Man is our only hope!!
FYI Spotify didn‚Äôt recognize the link.  It I searched Women for Biden on Spotify and found this and another playlist. üòä

Biden has a medical stutter.. He has no control over it, Trump on the other hand has no excuse as he is in "Very good health"
Yeah, that's to get more votes, also Biden isn't even socialist.
If not as VP, you have to be a part of Biden‚Äôs clean up plan.
Neither can Trump, but Biden actually has an excuse why, he has a stutter. Sorry you've been manipulated to only see bad things about Biden even if Trumps done the same. Wake up.
Please. Then actually bounties will be made and Hunter Biden will be insured he gets dads cut.
I would swap out Demings for VP and Harris as AG. Def Warren at HHS. Agnostic on Rice. Since you asked. But Biden doesn‚Äôt listen to me so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
Biden would piss his pants in the first 5 minutes!
First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
I just wish we could all wake up and see that the real problem is our two party system. We get two picks either a racist who let thousands die during the covid pandemic for the economy or a ‚Äúformer‚Äù racist pedophile. Why are these our only two choices?
Carlin also didn't vote. I loved a lot of what the man had to say, but people are using that clip where he says voting is pointless, and I've seen too much go wrong for vulnerable minorities-- friends included-- under the Trump administration to feel comfortable not voting Biden.
Please name one thing Joe Biden has done to improve America in 49 years,. waiting.  Have you seen the videos of Biden sniffing young girls? look at his children. What kind of person raises scum like that? Any opportunity to sell and influence another person is golden why pass up?
Keeping the crazy in the family. What is it about Biden you support? all his racists statements? his sniffing young girls? the way he's raised his sons -- creepy perverts like ol' Joe.  Please point to something positive other than the D behind his name.

Biden is the puppet...what is scary are who is holding the strings!
Yup, that‚Äôs the hellscape we live in now. And it‚Äôs terrrible. It‚Äôs going to take more than Biden winning, more than a Blue Wave to stop this. A serious cultural change is needed.
Treasonous Tiberius accepted donations, including the ELECTION, from Russia, but you don‚Äôt hear Nicolle Wallace using unemployed civilian, HRC, as shitxample to ask Biden a ridiculous bullshit question  And if you are going to orgasm out Beto‚Äôs name, at least pronounce it right
I sure hope the Biden campaign hook  up for all these awesome videos he is tweeting out. Love this!
You can‚Äôt blame Trump for China‚Äôs virus they unleashed on the world. Else you blame every leader in the world. And if communties don‚Äôt care when they burn down their own homes and businesses that‚Äôs just a mental deffency. Oh that may be Biden!
I‚Äôve told you before I hate both of them. Put me straight down the middle. I think he‚Äôs done some good and done some bad. And I think Biden will be good and bad. We are fucked no matter what bro
Come on Sid. You know the questions Biden gets are just as soft &amp; you know I‚Äôm not a trump guy. I will say that was a good one and made me laugh.
battles.  9. Always remember, cable media doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck they are talking about. Especially about black voters.  10. Donate &amp; volunteer for down ballots. We need more than Biden. We need local, state, House, &amp; Senate to escape the 30% holding us hostage
thing to say), and not welcome ANY opportunity for Little Elm Community Theatre theatrics on the House Floor, then I have levees to sell you. Anytime a Trumpfederate attacks AOC, a Dem gets a wing.  8. If Biden asks Norman Bates to speak at the convention, let him. Going /6
Don‚Äôt worry Stephen, we know how you feel and also wonder how in the world you could support Biden or any democrat these days.  Never understand it....
Outside of Twitter and national media, not many care who Biden picks for VP. His pick will not make much of a difference now. It may in 2022 and 2024, though
Biden is in a perfect position in the polls to pick someone he is comfortable and confident she is ready to take the wheel   Harris, Rice, or Duckworth  I would add Warren but her hypocritical faux feminist, self entitled cult would fuck this up for Dems
Finally, a good headline
Just like all Trump does is talk about Obama, Hilary and Biden?! ü§£ Hypocrisy!
Sounds pretty accurate!!! Especially if Biden won, which he won't. Just saying, the DEMOCRATS are playing games!!! They will cheat and lie to get what they want! #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
TIME TRAVEL WITH TRUMP?...good Biden slogan ha.. Trump fixer Cohen in 2015-  "By the very definition, you can‚Äôt rape your spouse.‚Äù Indeed, mid 70's all 50 states said no biggie, as late as '92 a few still said no problem!  Exemptions still exist wow. Go back? or move forward?
Legit felt crazy and gaslit for noticing this was a repeat of 2016 with Biden instead of Trump.
Honestly it‚Äôs baffling how you try to impeach the President on ‚ÄúQuid Pro‚Äù with lies. Then support Biden who‚Äôs Quid Pro was caught on video. Those people seriously need a helmet.

Watching  shut it down on #Maddow.  I am strongly against ‚ÄúVP MUST be a WOC‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúVP HAPPENS to be a WOC.‚Äù However, it makes sense if Biden chooses a Red State Dem as VP: to flip, give confidence to LARGE fraction Dems take for granted,&amp; win Red State leftists
I‚Äôm not surprised or worried about Biden. It‚Äôs not complacency saying he‚Äôs got this. Even if he picks Cersei Lannister as VP  But we need to win that Senate &amp; get Tyrant Turtle out of there. Also allow Human Phoenix RBG retire in peace Let‚Äôs do our best to win red states in reach

Sure!!! You look religious! If you believe in God there is no way you would want to vote for Biden. They are all part of a Satanic culture. Democrats are. They started the Kkk because the Republicans allowed the first black ppl in congress. The dems are evil.
Lmao!!! Cnn has you all brainwashed. Its sad how many ppl just  cant see the truth!! Look at what Obama and Biden did??
Biden campaign clarifies claim Trump ‚Äòfirst‚Äô racist president, after past slave owners noted
So the Senator is saying that Trump will have caused the demoralization of 40 million Americans, and a depression in our economy, and Biden will wake up with the need to fix that, and it is a reason to vote for TRUMP?!?!?  What a weird way to say it.
but mediocre ain't killing anybody - we're headed to a ( more) socialistic state for sure - 'trumpism' is not slowing this down - it's accelerating it - moderate Biden will now be liberal as hell. White folks need to admit ha - our reign of good (us) and terror (not us) is over
The real issue is what would another four years of tRump do? Even if you hate Biden with a passion - you still have no choice but to vote for him IMOBiden‚Äôs smart followers don‚Äôt watch the moron Fucker Carlson. tromps stupid followers do watch the moron Fucker Carlson. Enough said.
Hey David, what if Donald Trump, starting today, did exactly what Obama/Biden/Hillary/Comey/Strzok/Brennan/Page/antifa/media did in 2016 (and are still doing)?  Would that be an acceptable way to handle a lost election?  Can Trump start spying on (I mean surveilling) Biden camp?

BASHING PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE CORONAVIRUS IS JUST ANOTHER POLITICAL MANEUVER TO GET BIDEN OVER THE FINISH LINE.  LETS NOT TURN A BLIND EYE TO ALL THE DESTRUCTION THE CAPITOL HILL DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE TO OUR COUNTRY.
...... one thing Joe Biden has done for black Americans???  üëâ Fleeced them without the common courtesy of a reach around  #DemocratsAreADisgrace
I'm not a fan of biden, however he has one(?) credible accusation that was thoroughly investigated with like 80 witnesses but they will hyper focus on that while ignoring the something like 30 accusations of assault that trump has WITH the "grab her by the pussy" thing on record
OBAMA PROMOTING MAIL IN VOTING AT LEWIS'S FUNERAL IS DISGUSTING.  DEMOCRATS WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET BIDEN OVER THE FINISH LINE.  BY USING THE CORONAVIRUS FEARMONGERING IS ANOTHER DEMOCRAT TACTIC TO KEEP AMERICANS FROM THE VOTING BOOTH.
I'VE HEARD OF FUNERALS LIMITED TO 10 PEOPLE WHICH IS A SLEAZY  FORM OF DEMOCRAT FEARMONGERING.  ITS ALL ABOUT POLITICS AND DEMOCRATS TRYING TO GET BIDEN OVER THE FINISH LINE BY MAIL IN VOTING. Sorry for your loss and it has to be heartbreaking for all your family.üôè
"I had about 95,000 positive retweets on that. That's a lot," Trump told Sen. James Inhofe. It actually got around 34,000 retweets, with 134,000 likes. - or just read the article ... so he lied;  he‚Äôs so predictable!!!
As deaths continue to rise due to COVID-19, Donald Trump is trying to distract Floridians to...express admiration for dictators like Nicolas Maduro and Vladimir Putin - even after Putin placed bounties on American soldiers. #TGIF
Is he aware not all retweets are positive? Did he read each retweet to see if there was a comment of negativity? Now I need to find the post and see if he even got that many retweets üòÇ
I didn't have to even look at your profile to know you were an angry Democrat. Apparently, Democrats always have anger issues when it comes to Pres.Trump. Biden's smut: OBAMAGATE, HUNTER BIDEN AND ALL THE CORRUPT MONEY DEALS WITH BURISMA/UKRAINE AND CHINA. Pawing little girls
President Trump. He is hands down the man this country needs at this time. And Biden would be the straw that broke the camel's back. America would never recover.
Corrupt Democrats will do anything to get Biden over the finish line.  Vote those bastards out of office.
Are you voting for Biden?
That's üêÇüí©  This should be decided between doctor and patient.  It's more propaganda coming from Democrats to get Biden over the finish line. No coronavirus = No Biden

Without proper education weights, result would have been Biden +23ish. UNH had Hillary up 48-38 without weighting. If they had weighted, would have shown Hillary 43-41 -- much closer to actual results. Goes to show how much education played into polling errors in 2016.

Cool! Now do Joe Biden!!
ONE DEMOCRAT EVEN ASKED BARR IF HE WOULD PROMISE TO POSTPONE THE DURHAM REPORT UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION.  Dems. are cowards and don't want the DURHAM report out before the election because it would be damaging to OBAMA/BIDEN and their administration. Pay backs are a real bitch.üôä
All these leaks are bad for her prospects...Even if Biden was gonna pick her, he almost can‚Äôt now...What would that say about his campaign if they couldn‚Äôt keep this most important decision under wraps??!
I would not call myself Biden pilled. If I hadn't seen how firsthand how terrible a Trump presidency is I wouldn't vote for him. I honestly wasn't planning on voting prior to COVID.
Yeah, you might as well have, but you still didn't. In my personal opinion if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Biden &gt; Trump, you should vote for Biden, if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump &gt; Biden, you should vote for Trump but if your preferences are 3rd &gt; Trump = Biden vote 3rd.
Joe Biden announces Annalise Keating as her running mate
Republicans literally make the same argument that a third party vote is a vote for Biden. So who is it for?? I don't think we could realistically vote our way out of a two party system without getting rid of first past the post so I don't see the point in voting third party.
Yep. Would love to know when a president Biden would have thought to close travel to China, for example.

All i gotta say is if Biden wins we are fucked
Biden is a unsympathetic politician who will use this opportunity (John Lewis death) to rack up the black vote.  Back in the 80' &amp; 90's  Biden's vision was to lock up blacks. Also, Biden didnt want black children going to school where his kids attended. All documentation on line.
Bullshit üí© you forgot to mention OBAMAGATE. BURISMA/UKRAINE AND HUNTER MAKING 50,000 TO 80,000 PER MO FOR DOING NOTHING-- THANKS DADDY. HOW ABOUT THAT SWEET DEAL OF 1.5 BILLION FROM CHINA TO THE BIDENS.  WHAT'S THAT ABOUT? HOW ABT BIDEN PAWING LITTLE GIRLS? THE LIST IS LONGER.
If Biden wins it will be the same...the left will burn this country down because they fill they can and in celebration. Biden wins....we are in trouble

I worry that the Roberts Court is saving its political capital until a Democratic trifecta arrives and the Court decides to start knocking down the pillars of Joe Biden‚Äôs New Deal.
Lastly, Biden's is a joke and needs to be in a nursing home.

Harris is perfect on paper, the Q is whether Jill has forgiven her for the debate thing/Joe thinks they are sympatico.   It's clear he's modeling search on Obama's, natch, and Obama famously passed on Evan Bayh (the better on paper candidate) for Biden due to personality fit.
I concur. Portnoy did a great job without the sneaky gotcha BS that ‚Äúreal journalists‚Äù now rely on.  Trump needs more interviews like this and Biden needs to sit down with
biggest problem with attacking Biden is that Trump has no integrity, scruples, or character. Therefore, Trump has no credibility when it comes to judging another person‚Äôs integrity, scruples, or character.
This needs more attention by main stream media because Joe Biden will get all the children killed.

Let‚Äôs just for a second say Biden did tweet this.  Why hasn‚Äôt he tweeted concerns of disasters and poverty and BLM etc etc before running for president ??  Because he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.

People have just now discovered Biden is a Republican? Lmao that‚Äôs wild. To me.
It was known for years?? I didn't realize that
There goes that ignorance again! ü§≠ Back here in reality, there is this thing called margin of error. Hilary was ALWAYS within the margin of error. Biden isn't though. That's why that idiot got impeached. #Shitler KNOWS he is losing. #TrumpIsALoser

This is a great tweet by Joe Biden.  Too bad he doesn‚Äôt know who wrote it.
The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)

Joe Biden should be in a rest home.
yes biden isn't as bad but he's still a terrible candidate
A person was stopped and asked who they will vote for. They said Trump because he's turned the country around and will do it again.  Biden been in DC longer than I'm old and hasn't done anything at all.
Well that should officially eliminate bass
No masks.  You only care when it benefits you.  A publicity stunt.  Vote for Biden!!!
Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just saying if you tell me that in 12 years climate change is gonna to do irreparable damage and I weigh my current options....Biden has a 2 trillion dollar plan which is not enough but it better than all of trump‚Äôs deregulation‚Äôs
If Biden picks her after this and the Cuban sympatico, he deserves to lose.  Holy hell.
Juan gets hat handed to him again and then starts lying AGAIN to cover. Biden and Obama left the Cunard bare. Fact. Sent too much to China. Fact. Will do not again if elected. Fact! Juan lies too much.
I don't even think Biden needs to debate - most people have already decided that they are sick of the filth that is  and his family
Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre safe. They endorsed Biden. Why should democrats be concerned?
BIDEN GOOD
if your weren‚Äôt getting you ass handed to you with Biden‚Äôs used jock strap! If you were leading in the polls this would be greatest election in history!! Lying dumb-ass!!
What would President Biden's foreign policy look like. A few clues lie in who leads his campaign's many different natsec working groups:
You know more people "turned out" last election for Hillary and she still lost right? Also, Trump's a fascist and Biden's a sexual predator...

Interesting, thanks. I did something similar and find Biden ahead by 4-5 points. I might be modelling something different though - does your chart show the voting margin in 2016, or the polling margin?
Rasmussen also says Biden is ahead by 6. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'm contributing to Democratic Senate candidates now. I think Biden will win and Dems will keep the House, what we need is to get rid of folks like Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham,etc. to pass  progressive legislation ASAP.

Biden also needs to execute the law so that everyone responsible for Trump's bungling is held accountable. Biden will not tread softly but he might need a big stick.
The first 100 days are significant for any president worth his mettle. Biden can't afford to be quiet his first 100 days. If he get a majority in both houses of Congress, Biden needs to work with Congress to get everything back to Obama presets, erasing all GOP damage.

Debating Chris Hahn is like debating a banana. He is so full of anger and so up-tight about Joe Biden. He will surely have a stroke when Donald Trump wins again. You'd think he would embarrass himself when he rants on TV. He is arrogant and rude - kind of like Obama.
Far left are annoying the shit out of me with the criticism of a Biden. I‚Äôm not saying Biden is above criticism. The far left is just being ridiculous.
Yup. I knocked doors for Biden all three weekends before the TX primary in my Kamala Harris shirt.

Good for you. Might offset some familial votes for Biden. Probably not enough for those if us tired of his failed Presidency.
As usual progressives in our quest to get everything all at once, we get nothing.. Biden won, and he‚Äôs a moderate he‚Äôs not going to change into Bernie. But if you‚Äôre actually interested in helping people, our job is to get as much as we can to further the movement.
conveniently forgot to mention that  condemned Trump for the immediate action he did take early on in banning travel from China. How much worse would this be under a Biden admin?
Biden wouldn't even have to climb a ladder to get to Congress like Richard Coke had to in order to get to the Texas Legislature (which met on the 2nd floor of the Capitol) after Gov. Edmund Davis refused to leave office in 1873.
Perhaps we could've NOT settled for Biden and nominated someone else.....
Perhaps Biden can send Hunter to talk to Putin and make a few million while he's at it.
Trump and the Republicans are doing, and will continue to do, countless nefarious things to lie, cheat, and steal their way to re-election. But this theory is batshit crazy talk. He's not going to rig the election to give Biden an 80-20 victory. Total insanity.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
Who cares! Trump and Biden are both frauds! Trump is permitting the deaths of Americans while bowing to Fauci! Steroid nebulizer treatment with 100% cure rate other countries are using no matter how many times covid mutates!

Describe Joe Biden in 3 Words.
Biden is not sound at all
Biden is. The science is settled.
Biden is anti science.
Campaign 2020 You can see what a good job Obama &amp; Biden did raising up minority communities in cities like Chicago and St. Louis
If you are a Muslim and you support Biden or Trump you should be ashamed of yourself these people are puppets of Zionist of Dajjal
You think Biden is the sane one? Well, you‚Äôre in for a surprise.
Oh, a Biden administration will make them even worse. They would MUCH rather lose to Republicans than lose to popular, more centrist Democrats.

Yes. Indeed. If only Biden could speak well.

The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Some of y‚Äôall never Biden types were making fun of Angela Davis and other revolutionary political figures who support Biden, calling them ‚Äúshitlibs‚Äù. Since you‚Äôre one of them, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me you Jork such views. But genuenly tell me, why not Biden???
She's always talking about how smart Joe Biden is.
But will you remember you‚Äôre the President?  Or you know, vote for that other Biden
Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it‚Äôs worst than the other. There will never be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù politician. Bernie wasn‚Äôt either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process
I genuenly question sometimes wether y‚Äôall bitches have any working neurons. Y‚Äôall made fun of Angela Davis, a communist who has faced oppression and opposition from all sides of the political scale, for supporting Biden. As if any of y‚Äôall who recently got into leftist...

Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.

Each state would get 1 vote, but let's assume D gov picks all D and R gov all R. Current count is 24 = D &amp; 26 =R. I count at least 2 R govs that would throw Trump aside: Ohio and Vermont. Biden is President. Your thoughts? (3) End

Joe Biden has a history of making racially-charged remarks, having opposed desegregation busing in the 1970's, claiming it codifies that a black is inferior to a white. In '75, Joe said segregation was a matter of 'black pride'. ...

The problem: you lack knowledge of FACTS. You've been relying on SPIN that is meant to give you a certain impression. E.g., the "Idea" of Joe Biden, the "Good Man." His entire career's shown that he's actually perfectly cool w/EVERYTHING Trump's done. He'd just do it 'better.'

This conversation reminds me what my family used to do. When ever put my opinion of voice they used to shut me down. How are we going to express ourselves w/o being judged? I'm not saying Kamala is a bad person all I'm saying is that she could do some damage for Biden that's all.
Oh wow!! I didn't know that. I have a tail too which I'm going to talk about it or I will end up in a cage. But if ppl wants whoever they want for the new VP that's their opinion just like my opinion wanting  for VP for Biden. We are so divided so much in our own
Ok I get it. I was just giving my opinion and what I feel is good for Biden/country. What's the need to go after that when Trump will do it in the next months. If we don't know where we are when Trump comes with his lies and conspiracy theories against Biden or his VP I will be

The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)

Joe Biden should be in a rest home.
yes biden isn't as bad but he's still a terrible candidate

No masks.  You only care when it benefits you.  A publicity stunt.  Vote for Biden!!!
Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just saying if you tell me that in 12 years climate change is gonna to do irreparable damage and I weigh my current options....Biden has a 2 trillion dollar plan which is not enough but it better than all of trump‚Äôs deregulation‚Äôs

Biden also needs to execute the law so that everyone responsible for Trump's bungling is held accountable. Biden will not tread softly but he might need a big stick.
The first 100 days are significant for any president worth his mettle. Biden can't afford to be quiet his first 100 days. If he get a majority in both houses of Congress, Biden needs to work with Congress to get everything back to Obama presets, erasing all GOP damage.

conveniently forgot to mention that  condemned Trump for the immediate action he did take early on in banning travel from China. How much worse would this be under a Biden admin?
Biden wouldn't even have to climb a ladder to get to Congress like Richard Coke had to in order to get to the Texas Legislature (which met on the 2nd floor of the Capitol) after Gov. Edmund Davis refused to leave office in 1873.
Perhaps we could've NOT settled for Biden and nominated someone else.....
Perhaps Biden can send Hunter to talk to Putin and make a few million while he's at it.
Trump and the Republicans are doing, and will continue to do, countless nefarious things to lie, cheat, and steal their way to re-election. But this theory is batshit crazy talk. He's not going to rig the election to give Biden an 80-20 victory. Total insanity.

Basically  may hand the presidential election to Biden. #coronavirus doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on politics &amp; opening schools will likely cause more Texas deaths.  #stayhome #onlineclasses Schools shld stay closed!
do people think that if Joe Biden was a politician in England or France he would be in active opposition to their universal healthcare systems?
Karen Bass‚Äòs Long March from Communist Fringe to Biden‚Äòs VP Shortlist  via
do people like this think that if Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden were politicians in France they would be trying to abolish the national insurance system or eliminate unions? Do they even understand what the were "progressive" means?
Whether you Vote Trump or Biden your still voting for a communist party
Waaaaaait a mfing minute. When did Biden become NOT a corporate establishment DINO who opposes damn near every progressive policy and that says "nothing will fundamentally change"?  You sir, are a lying, fear mongering, hate filled mouthpiece for a fucking disgrace of a president
People are forgetting who Biden is going up against so anyone on this planet is a lot better choice than who he and his VP pick are running against and I will vote for whoever he gets.
Fact check: Joe Biden didn't take a knee upon seeing a flag; he was talking to a child
How can Biden wipe out all the investments and retirement that is already gone?
We should leave *THIS* election ... Biden &amp; the #DemParty has proven they have left us behind --- we need to return the favor.  #VoteGreenParty4Prez &amp; all down ballot progressives.  Besides, Biden is now ahead in almost every state &amp; in every poll....they do not need our vote.
You just pretend to care about policy.  That's why when Bernie, Aoc, and Warren help Team Biden craft progressive policy you still shun it.   Fakers. All of you.
Biden was right about you back in April!
Nope.   Doubly not so since the USPS union endorsed Biden - the dementia dude.
Ha ha. Biden was right about you!!
I'm not really convinced these comparisons really can be made in a meaningful way. Biden won't create an American NHS, Bojo won't privatize the NHS. So are the Tories to the left of the Dems? It's just easy to support the status quo generally.

Biden predicted in April tRump would try to move the election!
Unless he applies his bronzer makeup himself, I think there's a good chance the person who does is voting for Biden.
"Why won't Joe Biden consider Juan Williams for Vice President??"
He almost sounds like he will be Joe Biden‚Äôs Battle Buddy in the assisted living home.  Just saying
Why? Biden is leading and he needs to maintain that lead and not let criticism of his VP pick by the Trump campaign change that in any way. He needs to go through all the ways the Trump campaign could react especially if they drop Pence and/or plan an after-Labor Day surprise.
Ventilators, bogust tests, non-starter drugs..on and on. Overspent and undersupplied.  I‚Äôm anxious to see how this all squares with Budget in the end. The Biden admin will have to create a task force or dedicated commitee to comb through it all.

He &amp; most of the GOP are all pawns being played by Trump.Their careers are ruined unless they stand up. They need to stand with justice, to stand with democracy, to publicly reject Trump &amp; support Biden.
Someone said they like trump because Biden‚Äôs a rapist.   ???????  We just gonna continue to ignore all info on trump I guess

So sad! Would the media be Fox News? I'm just wondering. Ty. Biden certainly has more experience than POTUS45. There's so much stress and COVID isn't helping it either.
It's only over 150k that have died from the virus but you worried about Hunter Biden? Really? 95 days till election, worry about that!!
I mean, there are tons of white papers about proposed policies on his site...  I get it. He's not a good candidate/true progressive. He's not my choice either. But we are literally in an existential crisis and a Biden presidency vs a Trump reelection would literally save lives.
Yang is far too smart to risk doing a Ross Perot and steal votes from Biden.  Vote Biden in 20, then Yang when he runs as a republican in 24.
He is JUST Corrupt. #Biden

Six months ago today, Joe Biden published an opinion piece in WaPo calling for swift, decisive action on a nationwide response to coronavirus. Trump spent the next six weeks holding rallies, calling it a hoax, golfing, and sending supplies to China and Russia. #Biden2020
Obama - Biden team sold off our factories to China, left borders open to MS13, and allowed violent crime to plaque our cities. Want 8 more years of that? vote BIDEN.
He's a challenge I offer anyone with the dumbassed pego shit for VP Biden - find one example of anyine claiming he actually did anything inappropriate with a child.  Just one will do.  And they need to make an accusation of inappropriateness.  Just one.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
Who cares! Trump and Biden are both frauds! Trump is permitting the deaths of Americans while bowing to Fauci! Steroid nebulizer treatment with 100% cure rate other countries are using no matter how many times covid mutates!
Biden Makes False Statement About U.S. Economic Contraction
Biden doesn't care about us, he's entitled to our support.
No, just one girl...
Apparently Twitter is a pro trump platform bc inspite of all these so-called polls showing Biden is a shoe-in in November,  every poll taken on twitter as to Trump approval rating, etc., has him getting an 80 to 90% plus rating, on the economy,  the CV, the wall, you pick one.

So, if I may ask. What is your alternative. Or your philosophy on why not voting for Biden
What research have you‚Äôve done. And ‚Äúvote shaming‚Äù is not real lmao. It‚Äôs always funny to me that all you never Biden people always live in a comparibly nice house, and standard.
By gasses I tought you meant some holocaust type shit. But yeah, Biden has gassed his own citizens with tear gas. But trump has increased that exponentially aswell. Is it that hard to comprehend.
Biden saw it coming; Trump lied that it was a hoax, played golf, put Jared in charge, and 100,000 Americans are dead as a result. What more does anyone need to know? #Biden2020
Firstly by man child, I mean adults literally acting like infants. Secondly I said that he consided some of bernies progressive policies. And compared to trump, he would be the progressive candidate. And third of all I never talked about gasses.. I acknowledge that Biden
This is a reminder my mum in her 80‚Äôs for the past 10 years the Texas GOP helped &amp; assisted her to get a mail in ballot &amp; contacted her for the upcoming General Election.  Good News for the 1st time ever she is voting for Biden &amp; other Dems down the ballot.
Let‚Äôs keep it going with fear.....just to get Biden elected via cheating
Ah yes republicans like trump, who have increasingly made the state more powerful and authoritarian, literally gassed his own citizens is compatible to Biden, and brain dead smuck, who has voted for bad things, but nevertheless recognizes that those decisions weren‚Äôt good ones

Their candidate is Joe Biden if he were more middle ground he‚Äôd be a highway median.  If this fails they will go deeper into the recesses if the left, similar to what the GOP did after McCain lost.
Good. Gives #darkhorseduo more time. Hoping biden cracks a hip and bows out and endorses yang.
In 2007, Biden praised Obama for being a "clean" ‚Äúarticulate‚Äù black politician. He knew Obama's "divisive and mean-spirited" attitude given his community-organizer training.   He never said Obama was "ethical",

As a reporter, the first question I'd ask Biden is to describe his cognitive test. Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV.
No we aren‚Äôt. Many people are dreading the beautiful United States sliding into a toilet of left wing politically correct totalitarianism, where mass illegal immigration is encouraged,and the liberty of the individual is crushed by the State. Biden is a disaster waiting to happen

Nunes has opposition research that he will give to Barr who will use that information to conduct surveillance on the Biden campaign. No biggie.
Biden Campaign is getting odd advice from anonymous sources to pour most of its campaign $$$ into Montana and Wyoming.  The advice is in Russian which should raise suspicions right there.
So writing a crime bill targeting blacks isn‚Äôt immoral to you? Being unable to complete an entire sentence isn‚Äôt incompetence to you? Grabbing a female aid isn‚Äôt indecent to you? Biden did all those things, but nothing to help this nation in the 40+ years he held public office.

The problem: you lack knowledge of FACTS. You've been relying on SPIN that is meant to give you a certain impression. E.g., the "Idea" of Joe Biden, the "Good Man." His entire career's shown that he's actually perfectly cool w/EVERYTHING Trump's done. He'd just do it 'better.'

Oh wow!! I didn't know that. I have a tail too which I'm going to talk about it or I will end up in a cage. But if ppl wants whoever they want for the new VP that's their opinion just like my opinion wanting  for VP for Biden. We are so divided so much in our own
If the question is whether or not she is going to kiss Biden's ass, well the answer  is hell no. Will she do her job and work her ass off, yes she will.   America is a misogynist and racist country and what's happening to Kamala is really bad. The Democratic party is failing her.
Ok I get it. I was just giving my opinion and what I feel is good for Biden/country. What's the need to go after that when Trump will do it in the next months. If we don't know where we are when Trump comes with his lies and conspiracy theories against Biden or his VP I will be

Bill Clinton and Joe Biden have allegedly attacked women  and children with no consequences from Media or their party. #MeToo
One factor in Biden‚Äôs choice for VP is someone who will be less of a target to Trump (as reported by the N.Y. Times). Are he and his old men allies clueless? ANY woman will be a target. Go for someone tough who can take the abuse and fight back.
My 82-year-old mother, a lifelong Republican, will be voting for Joe Biden. She is so disgusted at Trump‚Äôs self-serving, self aggrandizing behavior that she spits when she speaks of him. Golfing and campaigning while ppl died in nursing homes won‚Äôt win you votes.

There is no perfect candidate. She has had to work with the system she inherited. As VP she would be an excellent person to reform policing, esp with her social work background. Biden has a great final list. Would be delighted with any of them. #Biden2020
Honestly,  I don't care what letter you put in front of your name but you better hear me. You better start looking at what a Joe Biden Administration would look like. What his policies would be and whom he wants to put where. Don't lission to what he says but what he's written.

The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)
Joe Biden should be in a rest home.
yes biden isn't as bad but he's still a terrible candidate
A person was stopped and asked who they will vote for. They said Trump because he's turned the country around and will do it again.  Biden been in DC longer than I'm old and hasn't done anything at all.
Well that should officially eliminate bass
No masks.  You only care when it benefits you.  A publicity stunt.  Vote for Biden!!!
Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
My advice is everyone voting for Biden vote in person! Most states have in person early voting for at least 3 weeks before Election Day! Plan to wait, wear and mask and socially distance! Trump has made it clear he will contest mail in ballots cast for Biden!
Seriously, I will be so much calmer when I never have to hear  voice ever, ever again. And I pray on inauguration day, he just takes a pass and leaves before Biden is sworn in. The less I see of him, the better.
He will and we will forgive him because it is bigger than Biden. The current occupant of the White House is an existential threat.
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A

You used to love Bernie Sanders before Joe Biden became the nominee what happened. He wasn‚Äôt crazy Bernie before and you said Bernie was a good person and you were hoping he would be the nominee So what the hell happened?

Given every GOP effort to slam Biden has failed miserably thus far, you know they are just waiting for the VP pick to have a plausible stalking horse.

Biden also needs to execute the law so that everyone responsible for Trump's bungling is held accountable. Biden will not tread softly but he might need a big stick.
The first 100 days are significant for any president worth his mettle. Biden can't afford to be quiet his first 100 days. If he get a majority in both houses of Congress, Biden needs to work with Congress to get everything back to Obama presets, erasing all GOP damage.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.

I swear if it was an election between LITERAL HITLER and joe Biden, y‚Äôall would refrain from it because joe Biden is still somewhat of a bad figure
The Biden Rule: 'No Men Need Apply!'
Sure bitch.
It‚Äôs July 31,2020 and time for your daily Biden. So if you can stand in a line at a grocery store multiple times a week, why can‚Äôt you stand in line to vote? Only one reason - cheat with mail in ballots. Don‚Äôt fall for Democrats lies.
I'm voting and it won't be for Trump. I hope we get some Medicare for all from Biden or his ass is out in 4 years too. Fuck these old men who are not Progressive or for the people over the corporation.
I voted for Jerry Rice. That's Biden's VP, right?
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.    When Goebbels doesn‚Äôt let the propaganda agents know the plan, everyone looks stupid. #propagandalive #VoteOutTheGOP #VoteTrumpOut2020
The reason for your idiotic tweet.  Congress will NEVER postpone the election.
Thats not it. Biden has alzheimers. Voting for Andrew Yang.
Their candidate is Joe Biden if he were more middle ground he‚Äôd be a highway median.  If this fails they will go deeper into the recesses if the left, similar to what the GOP did after McCain lost.
He sort of holds the highest position in the country right now. lol.
Biden Goes Into Blank Stare After Forgetting Where He Is, Tries and Fails To Pass It Off as Joke
Good. Gives #darkhorseduo more time. Hoping biden cracks a hip and bows out and endorses yang.
In 2007, Biden praised Obama for being a "clean" ‚Äúarticulate‚Äù black politician. He knew Obama's "divisive and mean-spirited" attitude given his community-organizer training.   He never said Obama was "ethical",
Joe Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
Sorry, Legs-up. Trump will lose in NY and California,  but he'll carry the states that actually count for true Americans who want what's best for America. And that is NOT Sleepy Joe Biden.
YES! and he should be embarrassed about giving a campaign speech during his eulogy yesterday. I don't think Trump would do this at a funeral. SO TACKY!! Get out OBAMA. We don't want you or Biden around anymore!
black people don't like the cold. That's why they live in africa. Ask sleepy joe biden.
‚ÄòAre you better off then you were 4 years ago?' Devastating new ad uses famous Reagan speech against Trump
Dem party.. Party of anti-education, anti-police and anti science..good luck with biden in November
"Barack Obama Just Changed the Landscape of a Joe Biden Presidency" Obama's former vice president, Joe Biden, is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, but he has never gone as far as Obama did Thursday.  (So, now we know who the puppeteer is of Joe Biden! Tough debates Joe!)
I have a Campaign Slogan. It goes ....‚Äú The Better Man Calling The Kettle Black, Build Better Pot Back ‚Äú . You know The Thing !  #Trump2020 #Biden2020 #Biden    #Election2020 #Potus #POTUS45 #BLM #Protest #protests2020 #kanye2020 #KanyeWest
It‚Äôs funny.  Both Obama and Biden claim to have all the answers to our problems, but they FAILED during their 8 years.  In Biden‚Äôs case he‚Äôs been working on the same stuff for over 40 years= nothing!! What the hell has Biden been doing for 40 years???
I would not care if the caught Biden in a hotel room with a bag of cocaine a hooker and a pirate I'm still voting for him!!!
I had to turn it off, this was a funeral.Not a rally. And if it was, why didn‚Äôt you let Biden speak?
If Biden wins the Russians did it.
It‚Äôs not a stutter.  It‚Äôs the inability to articulate sentences, forgetting where he is, who he is and what he‚Äôs running for.  I wouldn‚Äôt criticize someone for a stutter.  I have a friend who has one.  What Biden does is not a stutter.  Watch this:
An American Patriot holding the hill! Coach, fear not, American Patriots are by your side on that hill!
As a reporter, the first question I'd ask Biden is to describe his cognitive test. Person, Woman, Man, Camera, TV.
Biden spoke for organization founded and led by Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas operatives
No we aren‚Äôt. Many people are dreading the beautiful United States sliding into a toilet of left wing politically correct totalitarianism, where mass illegal immigration is encouraged,and the liberty of the individual is crushed by the State. Biden is a disaster waiting to happen
Trump Escalates His Election Doubts With Biden Lead Widening
Obama wants a third term so badly if Biden is elected Obama will be the puppet master. #Trump2020 #AmericaFirst #Freedom #MAGA
Remember when Biden said this?
Please remember when Biden said this
Biden is being groomed to allow an otherwise national political failure Kamala Harris to slide into the Presidency.  Crackpot you say? Hardly.
Trump isn't guilty of anything. Joe Biden is involved so is Obama.
Except they're using the same message against Biden they would against Bernie.
Obama is campaigning for his third term he will be running the country if Biden is elected.  #Trump2020 #Freedom #MAGA
He *is* hiding in his basement, though. Probably for the best, I'd rather Biden wins, tbh.
Lmao. Who would have known this movie predicted Biden's speeches from his basement.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Nunes has opposition research that he will give to Barr who will use that information to conduct surveillance on the Biden campaign. No biggie.
Biden Campaign is getting odd advice from anonymous sources to pour most of its campaign $$$ into Montana and Wyoming.  The advice is in Russian which should raise suspicions right there.
I don't care who Biden picks for VP. All the people on the list would be fantastic as the VP. Just pick one of them and get this show on the road.  That's it. That's the Tweet.
We now know that Biden was prescient, accessing information about things before they happened.
And you think Biden is more coherent? Hell the main reason I am voting for Trump again is because Biden can‚Äôt put two coherent sentences together. It‚Äôs basically a choice of the lesser of two evils
DIScouraging that this is needed...ENcouraging the people are thinking about it and taking action. ‚úùÔ∏è‚úåüíõüá∫üá∏  "A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty."
tomorrow in the U.S, around 220,000 muslims will spend Eid in prison. that is about one-tenth of the people incarcerated inside of thousands of U.S. state and federal facilities in large part because of joe biden
To bad he won't be around to see it.  The votes will be tallied on electon night and only states that are too close to call may run over a day or two. When Biden wins he will be removed from office on January 20, 2021. His lawsuit won't do him any good.
Sounds like you're describing Democrats like Biden an Obama
Oh I know. üò¢üíî
Lol Never going to happen ,Hillary couldn't beat him lol you think Biden the pervert an Kamala the blow job queen can?? Lol lol a feeler an a kneeler .lol
I would love that!!! But I feel for Joe Biden. This is a bigger mess than GWB left.
It‚Äôs just a little opposition research. Nothing to worry about. I‚Äôm sure it will be enough evidence for Barr to run surveillance on the Biden campaign.
Biden wasn‚Äôt our first choice, but that‚Äôs the card we got dealt.  Idk why people who are most likely going to vote Democrat in November still spend time bashing him.
Tweeting like this is irresponsible.   You‚Äôre either voting for Trump or Biden. There‚Äôs no in between and there‚Äôs no 3rd party.

HRC NEVER accepted the election results &amp; when shit got real, she got with Obama, Biden, Holder Lynch, Comey &amp; started breaking laws hoisting anything they could  I gotta tell ya I wasnt on the trump train in 2016 I wanted Cruz to win but now I'm glad we got him.
I‚Äôve got a lil‚Äô bit of a ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù candidate for Biden‚Äôs VP: a fella from St. Louis that some people know as ‚ÄúKen Bone.‚Äù
Bet biden weasles out if debates! Trump will destroy him. Bumbling old man doesnt know where he is half the time.
It‚Äôs opposition research, completely legal.   I‚Äôm sure this information will allow Barr to conduct surveillance on the Biden campaign in a completely ‚ÄúBy the Book‚Äù (as Susan Rice so eloquently put it) investigation into corruption.
"Rashida Tlaib declines to back Biden amid tough House reelection fight: report" | Fox News  [ Huh ?   What's this about ?   She wants Biden's endorsement first &amp; he hasn't even called her ?]
Cant wait to drink liberal tears nov 4th. On a serious note, if biden wins you will have NO LIFE in the absence of chasing potus tweets. I feel bad for you, worse case of tds in the world, well behind deNiro
Filibuster is a Jim Crow relic, yet Biden is the relic. Biden in the 1970s fought against bussing and integrating schools in Delaware
The fact that people actually think this way, unless they are already very wealthy and unimpacted, is insane.  Biden is the clear front runner. If there was ever a time to take the corporate donors to task, this is it.
Describe Joe Biden in 3 Words.
Biden is. The science is settled.
Biden is anti science.
Campaign 2020 You can see what a good job Obama &amp; Biden did raising up minority communities in cities like Chicago and St. Louis
Watch Joe Biden lose the next election and Hillary will write her 2nd book of excuses for his reasons for losing!!! She would just have to recopy her first book!! Ha!!!
If you are a Muslim and you support Biden or Trump you should be ashamed of yourself these people are puppets of Zionist of Dajjal
You think Biden is the sane one? Well, you‚Äôre in for a surprise.
Oh, a Biden administration will make them even worse. They would MUCH rather lose to Republicans than lose to popular, more centrist Democrats.
Says your PR people...whatever Biden camp....keep dreaming
Yes. Indeed. If only Biden could speak well.
‚ÄúSteve Guest, the director of rapid response for the Republican National Committee, responded, ‚ÄúJoe Biden is off his rocker to make such an irresponsible allegation without any evidence.‚Äù Well, now we have the evidence.‚Äù
Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice
Some of y‚Äôall never Biden types were making fun of Angela Davis and other revolutionary political figures who support Biden, calling them ‚Äúshitlibs‚Äù. Since you‚Äôre one of them, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me you Jork such views. But genuenly tell me, why not Biden???
She's always talking about how smart Joe Biden is.
I think I‚Äôll feel a LOT safer in President Biden‚Äôs America than I have in the past 3 and a half years under Pretendident Trump‚Äôs cruel and incompetent
Watch "Joe Biden Forgets Where He Is Again Due to His Alzheimers Disease" on YouTube
Ann, you‚Äôre probably sad about this.  Your attacks on Trump will only help Biden win.  Shame on you.  You‚Äôre like a little baby who didn‚Äôt get your way
But will you remember you‚Äôre the President?  Or you know, vote for that other Biden
Biden and trump. Both bad. YES. But one it‚Äôs worst than the other. There will never be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù politician. Bernie wasn‚Äôt either. But until the revolution, we must change this shithole of a country through electoral process
I genuenly question sometimes wether y‚Äôall bitches have any working neurons. Y‚Äôall made fun of Angela Davis, a communist who has faced oppression and opposition from all sides of the political scale, for supporting Biden. As if any of y‚Äôall who recently got into leftist...
What other option do you have my guy, Donald has made this country Into an increasingly militaristic state, threatening the lives of minorities (lgbt, black and Latinos). But you‚Äôre out here complaining because ‚Äúmuhh Biden bad.‚Äù
Betcha he did. He threw away his vote in 2016 if that was the case. Clearly, he's now wanting to vote Trump back in by going 3rd party again. There's only one non-Trump candidate with a chance to win. Trump must lose. Biden gets my vote.
Yes I will vote Biden this November
How did America forget Trump asked China for Biden investigation! Trump Publicly Urges China to Investigate the Bidens
If you think Biden has some kind of independent power over his party, that's news to no one.
My life is not dictates who the president is. It‚Äôs dictated by what he does. Trump is fighting for me. Biden will not.
Each state would get 1 vote, but let's assume D gov picks all D and R gov all R. Current count is 24 = D &amp; 26 =R. I count at least 2 R govs that would throw Trump aside: Ohio and Vermont. Biden is President. Your thoughts? (3) End
If Donald Trump was the alarm for this country, Joe Biden is the snooze button
So if you agree, can we count on your vote to keep the USA great? Biden led by socialist Bernie and his squad will turn the USA into Venezuela, a great nation destroyed. Please help save our USA from socialism! XOXOXOXO
Impeach him a million times democrats we don't give a fuck... He will serve 8 yrs &amp; you will cry... If you want control of the WH then run someone better than Hillary or Pedo Joe Biden

Donald Trump = Herbert Hoover Joe Biden = Franklin D. Roosevelt
Well I see he‚Äôs done more than most Republicans who just say they will do something. I can‚Äôt support Biden who is a member of my Church and is in open rebellion against what the church teaches.
And hes not voting for Biden, he just ‚Äúdoesnt know‚Äù now if he will vote for trump!!! Who doesnt know yet??? WHO?
150,283 deaths of covid and counting. Does the number 32.9% mean anything to you? Riding with Biden 2020 Y‚Äôall are going to lose big, that very clear.

I pray the independent #TrumpCrimesCommission (cough cough,  ), which Biden names the day after he‚Äôs sworn in, takes he &amp; Cruella down. They both belong in prison. Hell, let Tish James have a piece of them too!
They love power and money more than they love Joe Biden.
UK hadn‚Äôt changed as well. Although it doesn‚Äôt have gut to say no to America, Boris Johnson's government is privately 'desperate' for Trump to lose the election to Joe Biden
Keep on pushing.  There are people who see through you pushing this story.  Trump wins handily, but wait we have these uncounted votes that magically lean 99% Joe Biden, all in one truck.
Devin Nunes can show video of Biden eating babies for all I care. It‚Äôs not going to stop me from voting for Biden.
Unbelievable stuff in America today.   Biden must not ever win.
I‚Äôve finally decided I‚Äôm going to vote for Joe Biden instead of not voting because I want to see a president die in office it‚Äôs just a guaranteed major historical event I can‚Äôt pass up
If you are a republican voting for Biden is slitting your own throat. The current generation of Dems cannot be allowed control of D.C. or they will forever change the way our elections are run and lock out Republicans for at least a generation.
Devin Nunes declines to say whether he received foreign information meant to damage Biden
Wednesday morning, Nov. 4th:   Biden‚Äôs team had better bring their lightsabers.
OMG! It‚Äôs code for vote Biden.
What?  lied again? I‚Äôm shocked!! (Sarcasm) Obama used a funeral as a campaign stage for Biden!  if you were not able to have a funeral for a loved one, remember this moment. The only people who matter to Obama/Biden are the ones with power !  Imagine if Trump did that
Problem is Biden wont pardon him and if he quits now, Pence might pardon him but whose going to pardon Pence

...Biden worried that desegregation policies in '77 would cause his children to grow up'in a racial jungle'. In later events of 2007, Biden attributed Iowa‚Äôs educational successes to its lack of minorities in the state then he praised Obama for being a "clean" ‚Äù black politician.
If only Biden actually came out against Fracking. Texas ‚Äúsmall-government‚Äù overruled local ordinances. They literally ran on eliminating government overreach. Biden‚Äôs environmental plan is jobs and increased production. Yes, unfettered capitalism has helped our Earth so much.
Joe Biden has a history of making racially-charged remarks, having opposed desegregation busing in the 1970's, claiming it codifies that a black is inferior to a white. In '75, Joe said segregation was a matter of 'black pride'. ...
I like the way that  sums it up by saying that  clearly a cult
Stop gaslighting us into thinking that Biden is the savior. His politics gave us Trump.
dude. stop. being antie trump doesnt mean you have to make biden out to be something hes not. dont be stupid.

Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Biden was glad to assist Barry-O, bored floating along in Congress. ‚ÄúYou got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy."  Lewis, Jackson, Clyburn, Sharpton, Waters must have pushed to get in line behind somnambulant Joey.

...deemed too favorable to Joe Biden...‚Äù.  your going to be busy firing and hiring in your 1st 100 days.
Absolutely! And part of the classification problem is that Democrats are the only reasonable major US party at the moment (in an infuriatingly condescending way), so they attract more people under that umbrella than any 1 ideology. It's the party of both AOC and Biden.
Sorry I‚Äôm voting for Biden

You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Hey all...let's all say we're voting for him. Let's lie to pollsters.  And when the nov results come in, (hopefully with a HUGE Biden landslide)  he can't say " it's close! Its a hoax, or its rigged".
Let's see ... the neoliberal center-left political philosophy of Clinton-Obama-Clinton (and Biden) lifted billions out of poverty and extended the reach of liberal democratic institutions well into central, and even eastern, Europe.    Now we can't even go to Canada.
That‚Äôs right Mr Biden, now finish your pudding.
Beautiful little girl. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs missed dearly. We will get Biden in and get some sensible gun control, but we need to flip SENATE as well. So everyone please VOTE!!
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
Ya think they're not everywhere thanks to Obama/Biden?
Lies lies lies. democrats always LIE. Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue. The debates probably won‚Äôt happen the poor man couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day.
Your attacks on Biden are terrible!  You realize you work for the most disliked person in the world.  I bet Kim Jong Un is liked by more people than #DamagedDonnie.  He‚Äôs an embarrassment and the worst POTUS I‚Äôll see in my lifetime.
He didn‚Äôt. The states will run the election, he will lose, and if he‚Äôs still in the White House when Biden becomes president, I will watch the Secret Service drag him out
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
He‚Äôs Protecting us from vile left wing radicals burning destroying &amp; looting. Plus I don‚Äôt want a pervert in the White House we had one before in Bill boy Clinton he‚Äôs the one who flew on Epstein‚Äôs plane 50 times. Biden can‚Äôt keep his hands off any little girl he‚Äôs disgusting.
You only like Biden because you know he will run the country like Bush 43.
Stick to ... whatever the fuck it is you do. If Biden was president, the virus would be far more under control and the chances of a FULL college football season would be greater. You really are a stupid b*tch.
I disagree, I think Biden is 100% senile...the guys lost his cognitive thought process.
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
Biden is the one who will quit. Probably before the debates. He couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day. By the time of the debates the man won‚Äôt know his face from his ass. Thanks dumbocrats for giving us a man with Dementia and early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  MAGAMAGAMAGA

And it's a blessing - an unmitigated blessing - that he  didn't attend. The funeral made clear, as Biden makes clear every time he speaks, we do not have a president. The presidency is occupied by a malignancy.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.
He should have said that he is voting for  I mean what the hell is he waiting for?

Nope -- the legislature has the constitutional authority to appoint electors without a popular vote and with no role for the governor. Which could get us this, even if all other states voted for Biden.
Since legislatures can constitutionally appoint electors with no popular vote and no role for the governor, you could get this -- even if all remaining states vote for Biden.
But could this be a Gambit to get Republicans controlled legislatures to exercise their constitutional power to appoint the electors themselves ? Which would produce this map even if all other states vote for Biden.
So apparently Biden is booked solid until the election since he can‚Äôt fit in an hour interview. Ummm?
Stop lying, you‚Äôre just afraid that all votes that are mailed in will be for Biden!   How many years did you and your family vote by mail?  Count mine it‚Äôs coming by mail.
WOW, pure fucking lies... I guess Mashed Potato Head can't do anything except lie. Biden is not against oil. How about that big old electric self driving truck factory coming to Texas  ? Not that I think electric is bad. Self driving is nuts.
This did not happen overnight.." Of course not !! The DEMOCRATS planned it well ahead...just like they did the Floyd case to generate violence. In view of Biden's condition, I wonder what they are planning to postpone the presidential DEBATES and possibly the election too...
Lol Biden is so silly. This is a cute tweet
Biden has said in media that he sees himself as a transitional President, so I hope whomever he picks has their eye on the Presidency, as they'd be groomed and listed as the presumptive nominee. This is people getting upset someone who won't back down is getting the VP spot.
I don't like Biden but I guess he's the best we've got.
You should look up the definition of dictator. President Trump is not a dictator.üôÑ If Biden wins... you will learn very quickly what oppression is. #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
Texas is a winner-take-all state. If our delegates go to Biden, Trump loses everything.
Actually, the opposite is true. Barr only answers to he rule of law. It is the left that want to keep us dependent on the government. If Biden is elected, the stock mart will crash, factories will close because of over regulation, people will lose their jobs .
So Joe Biden is your choice?
They voted down cannabis legalization and M4A purely because they didn‚Äôt want Biden to look bad for opposing both issues.  They give zero shits what is morally right or what you think..... you should show them the same level of commitment they show you.
Don't get me wrong, Biden sucks, but for the most part the democratic party is for racial equality. Why else do you think 90% of black people vote democrat?
And Biden doesn‚Äôt?
Great news for the PRC and the Socialists Dems. Bad day for freedom  and personal liberty if Biden wins. Oh I forgot you don‚Äôt care do you, just want to win at all cost.Thats all you care about ; put down Trump.
Hey who‚Äôs up for a swim with Joe Biden? He‚Äôll probably let you sit on his lap and if you‚Äôre lucky, stroke his leg hairs!!  Anyone??
They need to opening up a hearing on the Biden leaks that only days after the raid, he starts bragging even though they had a pact with situation room. What a traitor. Ill side with the Seals father.
BY ELECTING JOE BIDEN!
Biden don't even know what day or the week it is, so why would we expect anything more running a country?  Scary
Biden forgot
I want to know how long it will take us to find out when Joe Biden dies?
If you vote for Biden you vote for abortion.
Biden will do that. He will take care of vaccines.  With your horrible record of testing. We don‚Äôt want your hand in any vaccine
Hallelujah!  In that case I‚Äôm definitely voting for Joe Biden because I absolutely do not want wannabe dictator trump‚Äôs version of America.
Hmmm this from the moron who told people to drink bleach to kill the virus. A real stable genius. I don‚Äôt think you want to go there with Biden...you will lose that battle.
Lol, Galveston Dems texted me. "Can we count on your vote " unsolicited might I add, registered Rep here. My reply was "Basement Biden isn't a good look"
Eyes wide open...
When Biden wins, I‚Äôm going to... travel to all the countries that won‚Äôt let us in now.
Need to do a little more research bud on those who blasted the travel ban and promoted socializing while it was spreading. That would be Biden and Pelosi.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD trump IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
please god don‚Äôt write him in for fun. he will not win and then biden won‚Äôt y‚Äôall rlly want that again?
They both are racist on some level.  The problem is that Biden‚Äôs tax policies alone will crush our economy when we are in need the exact opposite coming out of Covid.  That will have more of an impact on our day-to-day life.
Joe Biden is running from what he hasn‚Äôt accomplished. So wrong for so long Joe.
China definitely wants Biden to win.
Chris Wallace is a hack he can lead Biden safely through the wall of crap and planned questions that's showbiz
Let‚Äôs not forget opportunity zones and massive HBU funding and reversal of Joe Biden‚Äôs crime bill that dis proportionally locked up all brown and black people!!
#Biden is admitting #Democrats  #VoteByMail is an attempt to steal the election because without it they can‚Äôt win.
Biden is a Godless Asshole.
He will still crush Biden, anytime.
The polls are probably BS but if anyone on here takes for granted the stupidity of most Americans or the ones that are just tired of Trumps tweets and won‚Äôt vote period you do so at your own peril!  Biden can and will win if conservatives or independents take this for granted!
You live in America right? Then he is your president. Just like if Biden wins, he‚Äôll be my president. Stop being a baby about all this. And stop confirming to the Left‚Äôs ideologies. They make up rumors about Trump to make him looks bad. Start doing research yourself! God bless!
Straight to Biden, to China and then back to Biden, it's all the same.
I honsstly have no idea whag your point is besides a vote for anyone beside Biden is helping Trump.
See: 1994 crime bill, sponsored and co-created by... Joe Biden
I'm Joe Biden's husband, Joe Biden.  This is your champion?
Wait... I have to vote for Biden or else?  So now it's not even enough to not vote Trump.  This is interesting.
Biden Campaign recruiting video?
Yes, I understand Biden was the VP back when he could put a sentence together.  Not sure what your point is, I will not vote for him.
Biden: Oh you know the thing, that Washington football team.
Wasn‚Äôt Biden caugtvrepeatly using the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word
Wh.. Wha... WHAT????  I‚Äôm a nurse and that‚Äôs not a thing. Dementia is a thing and Biden is their new ‚Äú Poster Child‚Äù.
Fake, I live in the same area, Trump 2020 signs everywhere. I drive to med center everyday and I have not seen one Biden sign or bumper sticker!
Biden is now a ‚Äúcardboard cutout‚Äù !  God help our country since Her citizens are now too preoccupied to help ourselves.You haven't seen nothing yet. If Biden and his cronies ever gets in it's going to make that proposed increase look like chump change.
Ending the filibuster is crucial for progress in 2021 and beyond. Warren understood that. Now they need to get Biden et all to understand it.
If Biden wants to double down on a ‚Äòthird Obama term,‚Äô he should pick Susan Rice
No need for you to vote.               - Ridin‚Äô with Biden
No one cares about Benghazi anymore but Trump voters. So please explain how that would hurt Biden?
Her hands are just as dirty as Obama's, Biden, and Susan Rice.
Now, my future plan is to vote for Mr. Biden in November; who are you voting for in November?
True, but Biden can't remember what was said 7 seconds ago
You need to take off the blinders and read what President Obama and Vice President Biden (soon to be President Biden) did with immigration. Stop watching Fox/fake news. Now, go away and worship 45 while he is still there.
Governor, while we are on the subject of Biden's Black woman selection as VP, I expect a White female voter backlash as a result. As a Pres. contender, his decision should never have been based on race but who was the best qualified. But women should be considered not by race.
President Biden I really believe that Karen Bass should be your VP. She has a wonderful spirit just like you
PRESIDENT BIDEN dont worry he is out of there we about to take America back and the house and Senate we sick of all of them dam dummies
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
And just this is someone who Joe Biden says he will be relying on for advice.
THIS JUST IN: KANYE WANTS TO BEAT BIDEN OFF
Help the Biden settle in? what are you to do throw a cocaine party  For his son... or underage sniffer (stripper) party for him
Maria any chance that Joe Biden would choose AOC to be the vice president? he did say he would choose a woman of color.
He has a right to his opinion. But, has he looked at the other guy?  Biden is not perfect; no candidate is/was, but he's a criminal, madman.
This will be a test of both Biden and Chris Wallace. The question is whether Biden will get the same tough head on no nonsense questions that were imposed on President Trump.
I would just like to say, you have more then just two options. If you don‚Äôt like Joe Biden or Donald Trump look at the other candidates or parties that are running in 2020. We are not just a two party system, It just seems like it at times.
Truthfully Mr. President, I don't think Obama had any option to come forward because Biden could become a loose cannon and implicate him and others in the scheme to bring you down.I do think Harris is the most likeliest VP pick and is a good choice but efforts by some KHive supporters to equate her attack on Biden in the debate to Biden‚Äòs foreign policy attack on Obama in ‚Äò08 and to Bush‚Äôs economic policy attack on Reagan in ‚Äò80 is a bit of a stretch.
If I never see his face from now until the election I'm voting Biden all the way
Trump is winning. 50% approval. Dems are violent and are losing. Biden is another do nothing baseman democrat. No courage.
Joe Biden will transition America to a one party state, this will be followed by a transition to a totalitarian society......

Go  BTW love what your doing in the outdoors   #spearfishing and #ebikes rock so does #gatorgripphd American Made rack American steel! I can‚Äôt stand Biden and all the other children running this country keep draining mijo
The top 5 happiest moments of 2020 thus far for me in no real order were Amy placing third in NH, Pete dropping out, Super Tuesday, Biden winning the nomination, and seeing my dogs again every day.
Yes and I plan to put out Biden signs.
That‚Äôs  actually funny. But isn‚Äôt your child molester running against Biden?
We love having you You just need to get serious about showing independent voters who you really are. Do some commercials showing how Biden is using your 2016 agenda to try to win 2020, BIDEN IS A PLAGIARIST!!!! Show how he's using your words SIDE BY SIDE
Prosecute him in early February. President Biden won‚Äôt pardon him.
If Trump or Biden weren‚Äôt an option, who would you have voted for? I personally was looking at Yang before he dropped.
He‚Äôs campaigning for Biden at a funeral wow. Demon rats
Biden's gonna be forced to let protesters burn shit to the ground
Me neither. And, yet, I still plan to vote for him and out a Biden yard sign.
#MashedPotatoHead isn‚Äôt doing his job. Since he can‚Äôt do it and Pence is thoroughly compromised, let‚Äôs have Nancy Pelosi do it until we can swear in Biden.
Disaster waiting to happenüßê. Perhaps at the first debate at the "Health Education Campus Pavilion ü§î?
Yeah, we need Biden. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Of course you can vote. If people can protest,riot &amp; loot, then they can go to their Precinct to cast their vote come November. It‚Äôs that easy. You guys are a fucking joke because you know that there is no way in hell Biden can win unless there is voter fraud.
The #Economy is collapsing. Predictions for #Republican responses: 1. Faked data. 2. It's b/c of Democratic governors. 3. It's not b/c of #COVID19. 4. #DeepState cooks the data. 5. It's Biden's fault. (Maybe)  B/c Republicans never take responsibility for their own mistakes.
OK, Katie, you owe #Biden a big apology.  Will you give one? No, b/c to admit you were wrong requires moral character that you don't have.   #Election2020
You can't call out Joe Biden and not mention the creepiness that is

President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have very different plans for the next four years.

Joe Biden be like.., Yes I understand what you're saying...but ...  did you see my new.. "doggies!"
I wonder how much of this is actually from the defeated presidential campaigns of other candidates and candidates who chose not to run that don‚Äôt want to see Kamala enter 2024 as the de facto nominee if Biden chooses to not run again.
Yes, He is...
Actually, you can see the racism in Biden‚Äôs comment.  One must make a prejudicial assumption to see Trump‚Äôs comment as racist.
No to Biden. Enough said.
Biden is 102 years old, if he wins he‚Äôs a one term president
Don't worry about it. When Biden is president every thing that you changed Biden will just change it back. And there is not a damn you can do about it Spanky.
Yup, and they're legitimate questions considering Biden has appeared to not know where he is at times and his campaign appears to keep him in a choke collar when doing virtual interviews.
So you ‚Äútrust‚Äù Mr Biden?...I feel sorry for you...ü§îü§îü§£ü§£...#KeepAmericaGreat
so Biden is gonna lock up black and brown people again huh!?
I have seen &amp; heard all the women speak, but this lady Susan Rice is the one that gives me the security that she is the one to be selected as the vice president choice for Joe Biden. All women are excellent but for some reason Ms. Rice is the right one. üôèüôè
Former Vice President Joe Biden has pledged to choose a woman as his running mate and has said it'll happen before the Democratic National Convention.
PROUD üíØüá∫üá∏ You support BIDEN üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump and Republicans are running with the "law and order" campaign. Creating disorder and making it look like trump is fixing things then trying to say this is what we have to look forward too if biden wins. Republicans are unified in this message, democrats need to step it up.

The og tweet was deleted but referenced the idea that voting between Biden and Trump is like choosing between getting shot by a handgun or a shotgun... which pissed me off bc of the actual lives lost to the spike in hate crimes and hate speech under Trump...
I don‚Äôt usually agree w/ Chris Hayes for obvious reasons, but it is 100% a fair argument to find Biden‚Äôs wording hear to be concerning. In no way do I think it‚Äôs an indication of his governing behavior, but if we are to be the camp defending liberal democracy we must act like it.
What does Putin have to do with Trump. The ignorance of some people are the problem. If you want to vote for Biden and his Pedophilia groupies then may God have Mercy on your soul! Because I sure won't!!!!
The notes on Harris, who is a vice presidential contender, may be in response to a seminal moment in the first presidential primary debate last year.
Bunch of cops angry they can't use tear gas and rubber bullets and refusing to protect Biden at his convention.
NEW POLL: Who do you think will win Texas this upcoming presidential election? COMMENT Joe Biden or Donald Trump
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to have a choice in the first week in August," Biden said. "I promise I‚Äôll let you know when I do."
I think Biden considers their personal history, her FP credentials, and unclear electoral ambitions as major pluses. I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that she‚Äôd be the ‚Äòdo no harm‚Äô candidate alongside perhaps Harris who‚Äôs ambition and judicial record weigh her down.
Joe Biden stands with us! He will bring us through #ANewNormal And,  we will rise, again... together... as one nation... as one people! #BlackLivesMatter
Het! Get back to the hearing! I couldn‚Äôt care less what Biden gave to say!!!
Uh, corruption, it‚Äôs already happening now! Why r u so blinded ‚ÄúMr. Sulu‚Äù? You tout Biden who isn‚Äôt fit for office but his cronies will wind our American Way of life. Sad, sad.
Sir you are so politicized. How will you defend yourself when you have no police protection, because they will come for You, eventually. Think about it! Under Biden it will be as such!
It would depend on which city.  In my city, it would be schools, masks, police, federal agents, John Lewis, then Biden because we have high Covid numbers (with mask mandate), school starting in 2 weeks, and small peaceful protests going on, and our mayor is a white republican.
Only you Mr. President can make America great again. What you promised to do from day 1 you have accomplished. Demon-crates love to belittle you but they dont see their faults. Trying to defund our Policemen. Biden pretending that he likes blacks just to get votes. Wake up people
A Bernie Sanders campaign cochair says choosing between Trump and Biden is like having 'a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you've got to do is eat half of it'    With friends like this who needs enemies. Fire her NOW!!
Just for fun, let‚Äôs ask Biden if space aliens exist...
And if Joe Biden is found bathing in children‚Äôs blood to keep himself alive I will be very disappointed.   But that‚Äôs HIS pact with devil. Not mine.   And I‚Äôm still voting for Joe. pERioD

You can put Biden anywhere. With his dementia, he won't even know where he is. He'll sure as hell get lost in the oval office.

A vote for blue means you don't know any better. Trump and Biden are womanizers! Old, white and creepy. Is this the best Dems have to offer? Can't beat reds so Join them?
Biden will lead from the basement to become like Venezuela. Voting for him will bring more poverty and hunger. Many businesses will go bankrupt and unemployement will go sky high. Security in many cities will not exist.
I am voting Joe Biden no matter what happens here in Texas
Fact check and you are a liar. First of all Pelosi wasn't in the streets dancing and Biden didn't criticize you either. As a matter of fact, your closing borders did nothing really because it had already let over 300,000 people in the US while this warning sat at your desk.
You are crazy, Biden cannot even put two words together.
Are you sure you want to be associated with that guy? All I'm saying is Joe Biden just admit he is an MAP already

So who do y‚Äôall think Biden is going to pick next week for VP?
I‚Äôd like to see a multi partisan system that allows for electoral fusion and ranked choice voting, but rn our choices are limited. This novermber truly is an election between Trump and Biden.  represents the coalition of forces united behind a more progressive vision.
Please! Check Biden‚Äôs Senate record with drug companies! Check how many times he  sponsored bills that sent our pharmaceuticals to China! Educate yourself! Blame Trump for decades of high prices! How stupid are the leftist?!?
You need to educate your dumb a$$ self. Look at Biden‚Äôs Senate record on drug companies! He was the problem!
Biden is a ‚Äúhas been‚Äù and offers ZERO the the American people!!! Had his chance for 40 years!
You must be beside yourself with admiration for Biden, who canceled his months ago.
Vote for Trump if you want a strong, working-class America. Vote for Biden if you want a pedophile as your President.
You said not to debate Obama so I didn‚Äôt know what period you were using. When Biden voted against the embassy in Jerusalem?  Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the ACLU, tweeted, ‚ÄúWow  Already trying to out-Trump Trump.
who tf am I gonna vote for. sure as hell not voting for trump. and Biden is a no for sure. CAN WE HAVE A NORMAL ELECTION FOR ONCE
What has Biden done in the last 3 years that show he knows what to do?
Okay guess we give him a pass on the dementia and record. I‚Äôm not against Biden just the argument that he represents change.
I totally agree. I can‚Äôt understand why President matters more than county judge. Clearly ours has tons of power. I am for removing anyone with more than 8 years. Biden isn‚Äôt change though.
Change from trump back to the previous 8 years?  Was that great? Unemployment and gdp and wars and gridlock?  I‚Äôm not saying trump is great but I can‚Äôt buy the logic that Biden is change. He will not last 4 years so who is vp matters most.
So anything is better than trump?  My problem with that logic is decades of voting for the same party has given us Chicago and Portland and Seattle. How could Biden change what he helped build?
But Biden has been there for decades. How is that change?
Romney is not a republican. As much as trump may not be a republican Biden is clearly not so your logic makes no sense. I can‚Äôt get the republican I want so I‚Äôm going to vote socialist?  Please explain that benefit.
George may have some of the same issue Biden suffers when he has an audience.
Try as you may, it ain‚Äôt going to work, we have people dying by the hundreds from Covid19 while you‚Äôre awake all night trying to bring down Biden, it just isn‚Äôt working, have you seen the poll numbers
Biden has proposed measures to help Americans buy their first homes, raise the federal minimum wage and boost taxes on the wealthy and corporations.
Obama selected Biden to be his VP. Perhaps he waited to endorse him because he is 3 years older than you and you have shown that seniors should retire. He however is still sharp unlike u and doesnt think dementia test is difficult, like u. Biden will do ok as before, you will not
Who in the hell would vote for Bobby Rush D-Illinois. I just heard him speak on radio and he can barely speak English and is about an 80 year old black man. He makes Joe Biden look smart ü§°üëπüêÄ Called the President preposterous names Democrats are nutz.

Joe Biden was VP when the Ferguson and Baltimore riots and burnings happened.  He did nothing, he suggested nothing.  Obama ignored it too. Biden would give in to all radical demands. He is a weak old man, unfit for the job.
This was an Obama idea. He talked about it a few times in speeches but couldnt make it happen. If Biden and Dems win America is over

Well, now I know for sure that you haven‚Äôt a clue what you are talking about. If you did 2 seconds of research you would find that video was from 2006. 14 YEARS AGO. In 2012, also on Meet the Press, Biden talks about how he and Obama have evolved on this topic.
I took a look at this article. It's an op-ed article and stinks of bullshit and the GOP. I cannot imagine Obama and Biden cooked up anything like the madness described here. It does sound like something Trump and the current GOP would do, but for the benefit of the 1%. #VoteBlue

Not a racist. Which is what  is accusing him to be. Let's not forget Mr. Biden was also friends with Mr. Epstein. What does that make Mr. Biden? Something we've already known him for

What does Biden have to do with Trump calling these wars beautiful? My husband‚Äôs grandfather was killed in WWI and his father was bombed as a child living in England during WWII. Regardless of your friend‚Äôs political views, what Trump said is disgusting.
Interesting. But 20 years ago I thought the same thing. I have a completely different view now. People do change their viewpoints, opinions, etc. However, I actually am not a huge fan of Biden. I wish there was a stronger candidate. At this point though, it‚Äôs #AnyoneButTrump2020

Has anyone else noticed that Biden,s ads his lips are not with the verbage.
if your defense of the Biden statement is "he didn't really mean 'anarchists' when he said 'anarchists'" then you're arguing that a man who's been in politics for nearly 50 years as part of the ostensibly left wing of American politics has no actual concept of left wing politics
just so I'm clear your defense is that Joe Biden and/or his team are too stupid to know what anarchism is

Our country is in the middle of a pandemic, the economy is crippled, unemployment rate is running rampant and social unrest is out of control, and we have a president in a Republican majority blame China, Russia, Democrats, Pelosi and Biden.
I beg to differ!  Everywhere you go you see Trump signs, flags, bumper stickers, face masks!  Not one. Not one single Biden anything!  Nothing!  Go sell this Bullshit somewhere else but get the Hell out of Texas with it!!!
Trump blames everything on either China, Russia, the media and now Biden. Such a wennie!
Yes. Biden will definitely make America Great Again.

If Biden is found to be mentally declining. I'm still 100% still voting for him over Trump. Trump with apparently a fully functioning brain has done about the worst job you can do during a pandemic and if another happens and hes our leader we are SCREWED.
If Biden cheats and steals the election. Yes!  There‚Äôs no way in Hell he can legitimately win. Everyone knows it.
Agreed, but he‚Äôs right on enough other stuff that he‚Äôs gonna get my vote because Trump‚Äôs America is hell on earth. I live you passion and agree with you on so much. But not voting for Biden in this election is a vote for that evil asshole at this point.

Honestly,  I don't care what letter you put in front of your name but you better hear me. You better start looking at what a Joe Biden Administration would look like. What his policies would be and whom he wants to put where. Don't lission to what he says but what he's written.

The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)

Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just saying if you tell me that in 12 years climate change is gonna to do irreparable damage and I weigh my current options....Biden has a 2 trillion dollar plan which is not enough but it better than all of trump‚Äôs deregulation‚Äôs

conveniently forgot to mention that  condemned Trump for the immediate action he did take early on in banning travel from China. How much worse would this be under a Biden admin?
Biden wouldn't even have to climb a ladder to get to Congress like Richard Coke had to in order to get to the Texas Legislature (which met on the 2nd floor of the Capitol) after Gov. Edmund Davis refused to leave office in 1873.

Basically  may hand the presidential election to Biden. #coronavirus doesn‚Äôt discriminate based on politics &amp; opening schools will likely cause more Texas deaths.  #stayhome #onlineclasses Schools shld stay closed!
do people think that if Joe Biden was a politician in England or France he would be in active opposition to their universal healthcare systems?
Karen Bass‚Äòs Long March from Communist Fringe to Biden‚Äòs VP Shortlist  via
do people like this think that if Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden were politicians in France they would be trying to abolish the national insurance system or eliminate unions? Do they even understand what the were "progressive" means?
Biden is so tone-deaf I'm pretty sure he'll pick the cop
Whether you Vote Trump or Biden your still voting for a communist party
Waaaaaait a mfing minute. When did Biden become NOT a corporate establishment DINO who opposes damn near every progressive policy and that says "nothing will fundamentally change"?  You sir, are a lying, fear mongering, hate filled mouthpiece for a fucking disgrace of a president
People are forgetting who Biden is going up against so anyone on this planet is a lot better choice than who he and his VP pick are running against and I will vote for whoever he gets.
Fact check: Joe Biden didn't take a knee upon seeing a flag; he was talking to a child
How can Biden wipe out all the investments and retirement that is already gone?
We should leave *THIS* election ... Biden &amp; the #DemParty has proven they have left us behind --- we need to return the favor.  #VoteGreenParty4Prez &amp; all down ballot progressives.  Besides, Biden is now ahead in almost every state &amp; in every poll....they do not need our vote.
You just pretend to care about policy.  That's why when Bernie, Aoc, and Warren help Team Biden craft progressive policy you still shun it.   Fakers. All of you.
Biden was right about you back in April!
Nope.   Doubly not so since the USPS union endorsed Biden - the dementia dude.
Ha ha. Biden was right about you!!
I'm not really convinced these comparisons really can be made in a meaningful way. Biden won't create an American NHS, Bojo won't privatize the NHS. So are the Tories to the left of the Dems? It's just easy to support the status quo generally.
Joe Biden told me this joke but it's really Corny üåΩ üåΩ üåΩ

"Why won't Joe Biden consider Juan Williams for Vice President??"
He almost sounds like he will be Joe Biden‚Äôs Battle Buddy in the assisted living home.  Just saying
why did you like this comment omg
Why? Biden is leading and he needs to maintain that lead and not let criticism of his VP pick by the Trump campaign change that in any way. He needs to go through all the ways the Trump campaign could react especially if they drop Pence and/or plan an after-Labor Day surprise.
Eeeew any one who talks about another human like that is a predator no matter the gender
I couldn‚Äôt finish listening to that omg
Ventilators, bogust tests, non-starter drugs..on and on. Overspent and undersupplied.  I‚Äôm anxious to see how this all squares with Budget in the end. The Biden admin will have to create a task force or dedicated commitee to comb through it all.

He &amp; most of the GOP are all pawns being played by Trump.Their careers are ruined unless they stand up. They need to stand with justice, to stand with democracy, to publicly reject Trump &amp; support Biden.

So sad! Would the media be Fox News? I'm just wondering. Ty. Biden certainly has more experience than POTUS45. There's so much stress and COVID isn't helping it either.
It's only over 150k that have died from the virus but you worried about Hunter Biden? Really? 95 days till election, worry about that!!
I mean, there are tons of white papers about proposed policies on his site...  I get it. He's not a good candidate/true progressive. He's not my choice either. But we are literally in an existential crisis and a Biden presidency vs a Trump reelection would literally save lives.
Yang is far too smart to risk doing a Ross Perot and steal votes from Biden.  Vote Biden in 20, then Yang when he runs as a republican in 24.
He is JUST Corrupt. #Biden
Fine, but remember to vote Biden in the mean time.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.
Who cares! Trump and Biden are both frauds! Trump is permitting the deaths of Americans while bowing to Fauci! Steroid nebulizer treatment with 100% cure rate other countries are using no matter how many times covid mutates!
Biden doesn't care about us, he's entitled to our support.
No, just one girl...
Apparently Twitter is a pro trump platform bc inspite of all these so-called polls showing Biden is a shoe-in in November,  every poll taken on twitter as to Trump approval rating, etc., has him getting an 80 to 90% plus rating, on the economy,  the CV, the wall, you pick one.
biden see ghosts sometimes and i want the world to know :‚Äô)
I think the odds Biden makes it to the election as the nominee are slim.  That is, unless the Democrats know they are going to lose and are sacrificing him.  Their convention may be interesting.

By gasses I tought you meant some holocaust type shit. But yeah, Biden has gassed his own citizens with tear gas. But trump has increased that exponentially aswell. Is it that hard to comprehend.
Biden saw it coming; Trump lied that it was a hoax, played golf, put Jared in charge, and 100,000 Americans are dead as a result. What more does anyone need to know? #Biden2020

I would not care if the caught Biden in a hotel room with a bag of cocaine a hooker and a pirate I'm still voting for him!!!

I'm glad Joe Biden has told You What Color You are and how to vote.
Is this supposed to dissuade people from voting for Mr Biden?
45 is a pathological liar!! 45 did nothing about the virus for months and everyone knows it! 45 is responsible for more than 151,000 dead Americans. Everyone‚Äôs voting for Joe Biden in 96 days üåäüåäüåäüåä#TrumpIsLosing #TrumpVirus #TrumpIsNotWell #TrumpIsARacist
This is about delaying a publicly accessible treatment until November 4th! The Left is pulling out all the stops to get Biden elected!  Hydroxychloroquine works!!!
Yes. He does. When Joe Biden wins in November. It will be great.
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Biden was glad to assist Barry-O, bored floating along in Congress. ‚ÄúYou got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy."  Lewis, Jackson, Clyburn, Sharpton, Waters must have pushed to get in line behind somnambulant Joey.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt want Biden either, yuck.
Watch and retweet.. new Biden video!  #EvictTrump #WeWillVote #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy
Girlfriend you aren‚Äôt good at this. Moms, Aunts, Sisters, Daughters, Grandmas are all voting for Biden. And we know safety of Americans is His main concern, unlike your boyfriend‚Äôs Daddyü§¢
Good to know Joe Biden‚Äôs assistant.
Right!! You got two choices, Joe Biden or the Orange fuck Trump. We know what Biden is about and we dying seeing what Trump is about. I choose to live and have a brighter day. I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
...deemed too favorable to Joe Biden...‚Äù.  your going to be busy firing and hiring in your 1st 100 days.
Sorry I‚Äôm voting for Biden
A vote for Biden is a vote for China.
It could be a Biden/Chickenshit ticket as far as I'm concerned.  I trust his judgement.  #Biden2020
#BarakObamaIsARacist   I say we start rioting unti they unseal Hussein‚Äôs records!   America has had enough of this BS!! Obama/Biden  got us here, #Trump is our ONLY way out!   How did Obama come into politics as a poor coke head and leave a multi-millionaire?  #SilentNoMore
You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Hey all...let's all say we're voting for him. Let's lie to pollsters.  And when the nov results come in, (hopefully with a HUGE Biden landslide)  he can't say " it's close! Its a hoax, or its rigged".
Let's see ... the neoliberal center-left political philosophy of Clinton-Obama-Clinton (and Biden) lifted billions out of poverty and extended the reach of liberal democratic institutions well into central, and even eastern, Europe.    Now we can't even go to Canada.
That‚Äôs right Mr Biden, now finish your pudding.
Beautiful little girl. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs missed dearly. We will get Biden in and get some sensible gun control, but we need to flip SENATE as well. So everyone please VOTE!!
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
Ya think they're not everywhere thanks to Obama/Biden?
Lies lies lies. democrats always LIE. Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue. The debates probably won‚Äôt happen the poor man couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day.
Your attacks on Biden are terrible!  You realize you work for the most disliked person in the world.  I bet Kim Jong Un is liked by more people than #DamagedDonnie.  He‚Äôs an embarrassment and the worst POTUS I‚Äôll see in my lifetime.
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
He‚Äôs Protecting us from vile left wing radicals burning destroying &amp; looting. Plus I don‚Äôt want a pervert in the White House we had one before in Bill boy Clinton he‚Äôs the one who flew on Epstein‚Äôs plane 50 times. Biden can‚Äôt keep his hands off any little girl he‚Äôs disgusting.
You only like Biden because you know he will run the country like Bush 43.
Stick to ... whatever the fuck it is you do. If Biden was president, the virus would be far more under control and the chances of a FULL college football season would be greater. You really are a stupid b*tch.
I disagree, I think Biden is 100% senile...the guys lost his cognitive thought process.
This graphic implies that 270 gets reached at FL. But, by my math, if Biden wins PA &amp; WI and everything to the left of them, he's at 274, even without FL + NH. What am I missing?
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
Biden is the one who will quit. Probably before the debates. He couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day. By the time of the debates the man won‚Äôt know his face from his ass. Thanks dumbocrats for giving us a man with Dementia and early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  MAGAMAGAMAGA
If liberals believed in this I would support Biden
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  üò¥
It's not what Biden said or says. Just tell us what you say. We do support lawful policing. We do not support militarization of police forces. We do not support federalization of policing. We do support prosecution of those who loot, vandalize and are violent. Any questions?
OMG, he doesn't know what planet he's on, let alone what state he's in. Electing Joe Biden is basically electing the VP to the highest office in the land. And my guess is they're teeing up Michelle or Barack HIMSELF!!
Just know Biden won.
Thats how politicians funnel $$$$.... Look how Joe Biden got his son millions
Joe Biden: please nominate Barack Obama as your running Vice President!
That was back when Biden could string a few coherent words together. Still got it wrong.
To me, this says Biden is behind by 10 points in NH and we all have to work even harder now.
I will tell you the results now.  #Biden wins.  You are out!
And it's a blessing - an unmitigated blessing - that he  didn't attend. The funeral made clear, as Biden makes clear every time he speaks, we do not have a president. The presidency is occupied by a malignancy.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.
He should have said that he is voting for  I mean what the hell is he waiting for?
Couple that with this turtle walk on #SPYGATE indictments... you can bet if Biden wins, ALL documents/files will be long gone n case closed.
Sorry but I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Trump is a laughing Stock üòÇüòÇ.
this woman is so desperate.  All of the DEMORat Party is in panic mode because they have been CAUGHT. CAUGHT IN YEARS AND YEARS OF LIE'S, CORRUPTION, STEALING FROM THE PEOPLE, CAUGHT IN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT including PEDOPHILIA,. OBAMA n BIDEN  have been CAUGHT in Ukraine
I've never met a Conservative for Joe Biden. Millions huh?
‚ÄúLike, this is easy,‚Äù George Clooney said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two candidates here. One claims that our first Black president wasn‚Äôt a citizen, and the other was his vice president.‚Äù
Biden is getting 92 percent black support. Trump only getting 8 percent in 2020 yeah your so right Trump has done such a great job with Blacks üòÇüòÇ. Let‚Äôs delay the elections. The only man who says dumb stuff like that is when they know they will lose badly.He is the big Biden $upporter.  Also big in enviro support.
I‚Äôm voting for Biden to reduce the chance that cops trade out their baton rounds for copper-jacketed lead. That‚Äôs pretty much it.
No but you will if Biden was president, thank God that will never happen
Until November. Election will be on #November3rd You'll be gone on January 20th 2021. On that day we will have President Biden or President Pelosi. That rocks your boat doesn't it?
He and wife are the family liberals. Big Biden supporter$.  Big on enviro causes.
Democrats honestly believe they can float a far left VP into the Oval Office. They know Biden is sinking into dementia and are counting the anti-Trump vote and the 25th Amendment.
Indirectly. His complete disregard for the US, it's history, people and institutions has led to a historic upheaval the likes of which haven't been seen since the 1930's.  Biden's no FDR but it's still transformative.
Folks are wildly underestimating how many people believe all or even shreds of this and who will vote for Trump because they believe a) he‚Äôs the one ‚Äúsaving these children‚Äù and/or b) Biden is part of pizzagate.
Obama and Biden don't want voters to see this.
He is the west coast liberal in the family; already donated big buck$ to Biden.
James is the west coast liberal.  Already donated big buck$ to Biden.
Sure, if it's true.  However neither Obama or Biden committed treason.
Not Democrats.  Should Biden be elected, look for recognition of pedophilia as another sexual preference, with Justice John Roberts finding a right to pedophilia in the Constitution.
Have you seen our economy right now?  Obama rescued it in 2008 and now Biden will have to do the same.
So when are the fools at Fox News going to get behind our President and quit criticizing every time he tweets.  4 years of Biden will kill us.   Know you don't like everything Trump does or says.   Only God perfect!  SUPPORT AMERICA
And this is what I said and I still had people parachuting into my comments having something to say.    The VP pick has been handled horribly by Biden and his team.   This could have been avoided.
You can't make me vote for Joe Biden
You're a dreamer! I hope Biden picks you as running-mate, sniffs your hair and grabs your cock.
Wrong. There's also the way of evil winning when misinformed &amp; malformed people do the wrong thing... such as Christians voting Democrat. Biden has vowed to undo the protections for the preborn that Trump put in place.  Don't be complicit in murder SaintDominic13, or (1/2)
I‚Äôm sorry but that design for the new Joe Biden tweet shirt is so bad lol
Your hate and narcissism is spreading like wild fire. Even though Biden is not the choice we were looking for, he is safe. He knows how to conduct himself diplomatically and is the only choice to regain our reputation and embarrassment from having you in office.
Im not a fan of Biden but 4 more years of you is too much, rather just put up with someone harmless for the next 4 years than a maniac that is gonna burn all our bridges! You are not mentally stable to run our country, you are doing more harm than good.
I love watching Trump and Biden supporters fight.   ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre supporting a pedophile with dementia‚Äù  ‚ÄúOh yeah? You‚Äôre supporting a racist pedophile with dementia, bitch!‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell your candidate is a moron!‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre god damn right he is but is he a sexist moron? Didn‚Äôt think so‚Äù
Because hes as nutty as squirrel shit. They cant let Biden out of his padded cage.
See it‚Äôs hard to say if the democrats would have handled the pandemic any better when Biden says, he wouldn‚Äôt have banned travel from China like Trump did because it was ‚Äúracist‚Äù. Also if you recall around mid March there were only 100 reported cases. So there wasn‚Äôt need for
Well we can't see Biden he can't tweet and no one let's him outside do you think he will be alive in November?
Hahaha what community? The I hate trump because Biden molest little girls?
The DNC and Biden's staff are avoiding Biden having debates with President Trump. Events keep being cancelled with Covid excuses. You only need 2 nominees, a panel to ask questions, and a camera. All social distancing.
I can‚Äôt vote for Biden cause of the obvious corruption in the DNC, look at how they try to conspire against Bernie. He‚Äôs gonna pick Kamala as his VP &amp; not Tulsi cause she can‚Äôt be controlled. Not to mention his obvious dementia.
Kind of like Joe Biden the guy can't even remember his name.
Please President Biden, announce your cabinet. Annouce the rehires and experts who can hit the ground running and put our government back together.  I need something to hope in.

Michelle Lujan Grisham has not received the attention of many higher-profile candidates¬†under consideration to be Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate. But she has a resume that few of them can match.
. spoke the truth to us Texans yesterday. If Biden wins the White House our economy will be a smoking hole. He will kill the energy jobs and Escobar will flood us with job-stealing illegals.  This is no longer a partisan issue: we must all of us VOTE RED in Nov!
People be like go vote.. and our options are Biden or Trump üíÄ

There it is. He‚Äôs going to try to knock over the chess board.
Yeah Biden cares about the kids. Finally we‚Äôll get rid of POTUS that goes after his own daughter and says he has sex in common with her. Trump is going to go down with Epstein and the raping of all those young girls.
Biden is pathetic.
Wow Joe Biden's been 40 years in office OMG and  just now he's going to run for president. Donald Trump you sure do inspire people LoL
So if you're voting for Biden so you must be a Pedophile
Biden's orbit has sent the message to all women -and especially the VP prospects- that only subservient women should apply.  They want a work-wife for Joe. Someone who cleans up his messes but is otherwise invisible to his world.

Why? Is trumph already buttering up Biden for a pardon?
So now, any other selection will have to explain her subservience to Biden since people like Chris Dodd made it public that only women considered acceptable must be low-ambition do-nothings.  A work-wife to pick up after Joe.
As a guy who‚Äôs nearly as old as Joe Biden, let me say this: I want him to be President. And I want him to have a VP who is ready and eager to step into the presidency. So, good for Harris if that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs thinking too!
Exactly! She would be an asset to Biden.
‚ÄúShe settled for Biden, why can‚Äôt you?‚Äù Has me dead
Biden, with his ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äú comment proves he is the real racist in this contest. That you don‚Äôt acknowledge it is your own blindness.

This! So don't on my page because I have something to say about Biden.
I agree. They're making it worse for Biden. Because if he doesn't pick her...yikes.
Biden really needs some new friends. Because all his friends seem like small weak men that can't handle a smart Black woman.  Teeny tiny dick energy.   Fuck them and their misogynoir.  And they're also insulting the other women. Basically saying they can be controlled.
ü§£  Whomever is Biden's VP pick will be President.
This has NOTHING to do with the debate. These are small-dicked men who can't handle a strong Black woman who isn't scared of them. They're hiding behind this excuse. And if Biden listens to them he's weak too.

Agree.  But if Biden is elected, look for pedophilia to gain status as just an alternative lifestyle, similar to homosexuality.  And look for John Roberts to find a right to pedophilia in the Constitution.
I know all about that. I'm not going to relitigate past campaigns or candidates. My most important issue today is kicking agent orange out of OUR White House. The decision is up to VP Biden who he trust to be his wing person. I worked on Hillary's campaign in '08 btw

Imagine organizing a protest of thousands, running a police blockade and getting shot in the face by rubber bullets, getting arrested and beaten by BORTAC, all to storm a federal courthouse for... Joseph Robinette Biden.
President Donald Trump is painting a dystopian portrait of what Joe Biden‚Äôs America might look like if he wins the election in November.
Really and you have nothing to say about Joe Biden?! Using your analogy, I‚Äôd rather have Trump, keyless than Biden brainless!!!
It's very ironic how people called Mitt Romney a puppet for the right and everyone agreed but as soon as Trump calls Joe Biden a puppet for the left everyone gets pissed and says shit like "Good." and "Fine by me.". Just another bit of hypocrisy from the left.
Another reason to vote for Biden come November!
They are trying to prove an invalid point, somewhere along the lines of how we can all get along in "the biden administration." It's all just BULL$H!T. Just another democRATS cheap way of trying to steal election.

Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden slammed President  handling of the #coronavirus pandemic Tuesday, and he pushed back against claims by the president's campaign that he condones violent protests against law enforcement.
These are very obvious soft signals that Sen. Kamala Harris likely will not be on the ticket with Biden as his VP pick. Joe Biden knew his notes would be seen and my guess is that he is preparing the K-Hive for her NOT being his running mate.
I agree 100% with  that Joe Biden does not need to feel rushed to announce his running mate within the coming week. Joe Biden Says He Will Make VP Pick Next Week | Vogue
You missed the point. Never said you were a Trumpet. But you, like many Sanders‚Äô supporters have the same mentality as Trump supporters. I do not vote by party. I vote for the person. Unfortunately we are again stuck with the lesser of two evils. But Sanders is worse than Biden.

I don't think it's anyone's business when and where Congresswoman Tlaib makes her endorsement. Stop making this an issue!!! I'm proud of her and winning her endorsement will be an honor for Joe Biden.
I absolutely love Rep. Val Demmings too. She is the complete picture of the American dream and she is the whole damn package. She would be a really good President of the United States and I believe Joe Biden will pick her for his VP.
Nope. The bottom will be when Biden gets elected and everybody realizes the fundamental problems are still there.
She had more of the CBC support so I think it was about money. She actually helped Biden when she dropped out. I think if the money was fine she would have kept going and if she did better I'm sure he would have backed her.
That's literally how Trump got elected. Trump can't do any wrong because of Hillary's emails, Obama's fake spying, Biden Ukraine, etc...

Kamala is working for the people. She works with down-ticket and she's already doing everything for Biden. And we know she will always have Black folks backs. And she's just sweet and fun. No contest..üíõüíõüíõ My version of #ChallengeAccepted  #KamalaHarrisForVP
I think it would be great if Biden has the WH blessed with holy water to cast out the bad spirits.
Another reason why Biden can't make his own decisions. He is not mentally capable.
They know Biden would be a desaster in the debates. You don't need an audience. Just cameras, a panel, and two contestants all socially distancing.
The 145 is the odds so if trump wins that hundred turns 245. 100 plus the 145. You need to wager 170 on Biden to win a hundred .
You misread. He said Biden, not Sanders. Not a huge Biden fan but Sanders was worse. And you spewing your hate is very typical of a Sanders supporters. You all are the same as Trump supporters, so bye-bye.
Ain‚Äôt this the truth! Screw all the media reports and polls saying that Biden is leading, just all MSM propaganda targeting the naive hoping to pull some lemmings into their group.  Come November, #SilentMajority will be victorious! üí™üá∫üá∏

It's crazy how everyone else is sitting back while Kamala works for the party. While she's working hard for Biden. While she's working hard to help down-ticket.   Reminds me of the group project.   Kamala's doing all the work and someone else will try and take credit.

That's what it is. He's more upset than Biden is.   So this whole thing is about him and not even Biden.
I'm still voting for him but it doesn't mean I have to be rah-rah, Biden.   His case will be helped if he picks Kamala for VP. But I will be there because of her.

That didn't come out of Biden's brain.  Staffer wrote that. then breathed it into his nostrils...lol.
A vote for Biden is a vote to eliminate single family housing in the suburbs. Biden proposed to eradicate single family homes and replace it with multi family units. So if you want to lose your home vote for Biden

Yeah man I‚Äôm in no way pro-Biden. I‚Äôm anti-Trump. And if you just look at their platforms, I essentially just think Biden isn‚Äôt doing enough. But it‚Äôs easy to see the ‚ÄúOne of these offers less harm to fewer people than the other‚Äù aspect, so it makes my vote easy.
Trump is a coward, but president Biden is gonna tear it down.
Me either. I‚Äôm legit terrified either way‚Äîwhat 4 more years of his bullshit could do to this country and what his supporters will do if Biden wins.

there's an overly clever (imho) take going around that they decided "oh, we'll lose but Biden will do austerity and not fire any of our FedSoc judges" which... is probably what will happen, admittedly, but I don't see evidence of them following that reasoning

Biden is the real deal!! he is so effective at doing some things. Look at incarcerations from the crime bill he passed through congress. But, of course he won't remember this because he doesn't remember anything.....

Why we are voting NO on Biden and the Dictator Democrats.
I knew how to clean and cook at a young age. That whole woman's place thing has always been strong. I fought against it in my little family and lost, and won.
First time Obama showed real intelligence when he ‚Äú didn‚Äôt endorse Biden.‚Äù Poor thing had to give in...
The left likes founding fathers when it suits them. Trump improved national security &amp; is clarifying the constitution with several SCOTUS victories. Not sure about "personal" interest, surely not as great a Biden's, given his weird international ties. #lawandorder is not oppress
But, but, but....Biden is so center left &lt;sarc&gt;
Rice, she is more experienced in foreign policy, has a great long standing relationship with Biden, and is tough as nails.
It would perhaps be best if neither major party candidate for President would question the mental acuity of the other. Both seem to struggle. People in glass houses and whatnot.  #Trump #Biden #PersonWomenManCameraTV
It will come down sooner or later. Build bridges not walls. Thanks, Hannah.
Full court press everyday for 100 days... make it a ‚ÄúBiden-Slide!‚Äù
Same approach that Biden said he would take instead.
I'll take Biden's gaffes over your corruption &amp; treachery all day long &amp; twice on Sunday.   That said there are not enough characters available to me to list your goofs- but goofs aren't what make you unfit - grifting, lying, abuse of power, corruption, cruelty &amp; incompetency do.
OK. China hatches a virus. No control over their travel. No sharing of vital biological info. Cuts off US on PPE. Its a lesson in decades of politicians counting on a communist country to do the right thing for the US. Biden is in tank for China. Its coming.

Uh huh, sure. Kanye West can get more write in votes than Joe Biden. üòÇü§£
are they REALLY Biden organizers, or are they just people you found in a hipster coffee shop?
Biden's going to fall apart as the stress of the campaign takes its toll. How about a press conference with Q&amp;A? Or, tough interview, just one is all it will take.
There is simply no fact in your statement. A lot of wishing going on here. The more Biden speaks the more America recognizes his weakening mental capacity dropping his numbers like a rock. #lawandorder is on Trump's side
Blah Blay Blay Just Democratic opposition video (act blue). See how far it goes in public when they see Biden opposition videos. Let's face it Dems picked an old political horse left-leaning with bad reputation &amp; failing memory. Trump is like Timex just keeps on ticking
It‚Äôs actually comical that Trump was accused of rigging an election which was on Obama &amp; Biden‚Äôs watch while being spied on at the same time and still wins.
Biden literally has said openly lasf week he plans on raising taxes if he wins. The same ones also berate Trump for wanting to bring back manufacturing (Its not coming back meme).
Biden man bad
Joe Biden ( from the decode ) was named in the criminal investigation in Ukraine. I bet that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs trying to tell us. Maybe that will boot Joe out of the race.

High polls for Biden motivate Trump voters to turn out on Election Day
Trump thinks Biden is going to kill the suburbs in a Godzilla like fashion yet here are the patio daddy-os leaf blowing the feds
When asked about a cognitive test, Biden replied he was ‚Äútested all the time.‚Äù President Trump in an interview with  pointed out that Biden was tested all the time for COVID. Biden didn‚Äôt even understand the question about a cognitive test. The man‚Äôs brain is mush.
Joe Biden has insulted every¬†African American by saying if you don‚Äôt vote¬†for me, 'you ain‚Äôt Black.'¬†I‚Äôm Black.¬†I‚Äôm not voting for him.¬†He's an insult to every¬†American because people decide on the competency¬†of the candidate.

Biden apparently has a significant lead nationally as well as in most battleground States, according to most polls.  Will Trump and his enablers be able to steal enough votes via suppression or other means to actually steal the election?
Pres.Obama &amp; VP Biden came in following the Bush recession they rescued America's stock market, employment rescued the Auto Industry, &amp; reformed the banking &amp; mortgage industry. Millions of Americans under the ACA had access to Affordable Healthcare..Green energy training &amp; jobs.
No - you are either misinformed or a propagandist.   Joe Biden like me is a Democrat. Joe Biden like me is a proud American.  I know who I am and I know who Joe Biden is -  I believe in an America with Americans working together to find solutions and build a better future.   üò∑

You would think they would investigate the Ukrainian/Biden corruption investigation that is building in Kiev.  Or the Brennan/Libya/ISIS connection with smuggled arms.  Or the source authority for the 4 Billion in cash given to the Iranians.  But People died and Obama/Media lied.

If Baio had endorsed Obama or Biden, he would have never had to dodge one single arrow or jab. The media would have praised him. Before he endorsed Trump in 2016, Baio was considered an iconic Americana actor.  Cheer for Trump and it‚Äôs open season on him.

Is this man all there? Biden will be replaced either right before the convention or during the convention. I think the Ukrainians will ask for his testimony which will provide the excuse to replace him with either Hillary or Bernie.  Probably Hillary. Hillary and the Wookie 2020!

Sweetie, Trump is the one that can't hold a simple water glass without using 2 hands. Trump is the one that is taking cognitive tests designed to identify stages of dementia. I'm thrilled to be a smart part of ending Trump's political career. As for me I'm still all in for Biden.
Biden says he is constantly being tested. But he keeps pushing policies that are already being used.
The Maskerade will continue until after the election. Then waych the riots explode if Biden loses

Let me clarify... I hope that honor goes to Candace Owens one day, not with Biden, of course. I'll vote for Candace and Wayne on the same ticket. Make it happen Wayne :)
Here's the game plan: Biden picks Kamala. She's a woman, she's black, she fits their identity politics and targeted demo. God forbid Biden wins, he'll either step down or be forced out. Kamala becomes first black woman president. I'm hoping that honor goes to Candace.
Don't listen to polls. #Vote   #Vote  #VoteAsIfYourLifeDependsOnIt Because it does.  Vote as if Biden is down by 20% and your vote will make the difference. Some recent elections have been won by 1 vote &amp; the electoral college is winner take all.  Your vote means something. #Vote

Im with you on this one. I cant see biden running this country. Trump may have had some hiccups but biden would be a whole new nightmare.
Harris vs. Bass is interesting.   The loyalty question is also interesting. If Biden is going to keep his one term pledge, the VP pick will have the widest audience to be the 2024 Dem candidate. Is loyalty the question here?
This is no where near realistic, we all know that Biden seldom ventures out of the basement.
Joe Biden proves this wrong.
right, so, call me when angela davis is biden's running mate üôÉ
Do you really think in this admin is informed and smart enough to put together any of those arguments against Biden?

Im voting for Biden. I do not support Biden. I will never choose to support him. I will never be a fan of his. Supporting Biden and claiming yourself as a fan of his is to support and be a fan of an absolutely horrible person.

If you‚Äôre black and voting for Kanye you already weren‚Äôt voting for Biden
Biden describes lower classes as entitled and regularly attacks welfare as entitlement. His view points haven‚Äôt ever changed, his actions reflect that. Trump on the other hand has a mouth, but his actions show character that Biden just doesn‚Äôt have.
Okay, not speaking policy: Biden lies to people to get what he wants, he may possibly be involved in child trafficking, but that hasn‚Äôt been confirmed. Biden brags about being racist regularly. He discriminats against women, especially those with families.
Is, um, is ... is Biden Hitler in this analogy?
Kanye West Says He Can Beat Joe Biden for President by Write-Ins
His actions show him differently than his mouth. Biden wants to make cuts that hurt the poor, and dosen't care about human rights. In the 70‚Äôs he fought to keep segregation. That isn't compassion. And the fact that he fights the LGBT community now shows he hasn't changed.
Biden wants to cut SSI, but does not have any systems in place to change that system, instead, he calls it an entitlement. Meanwhile, he helped bail out the individuals who helped crash the economy in 2008.
Biden voted against gay marriage, is pro-war, and is for the death penalty and harsher drug sentencing. I believe everyone should have an equal opportunity with love.

It could be because how Biden said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not black‚Äù
This woman may become Joe Biden‚Äôs VP candidate! Think about that and then she enacts 25 th amendment and gets Biden gone and becomes POTUS. That will be a nightmare that would make Obama look like Robert Byrd! She is so left she can‚Äôt make a right hand turn. She needs to go hard
Biden‚Äôs going to be another Hillary and democrats are going to learn nothing and blame it on **insert anything**

This is what we have in store if we lose President Trump!! Biden will absorb Antifa into the FBI  AOC AS THE HEAD OF THE EPA. Imagine the mayor of Seattle as Secretary of State. Whomever is VP will replace him as unfit. Imagine Lightfoot as VP then POTUS. Next concentration camps
Obama is just trying to get ink. He is covertly being a Muslim trying to stir sh!t. It s a crying shame that the USSS does such an excellent job is all I have to say except this. He and that idiot Biden is why we elected Trump!!!!

These left Dem mayors and Governors appear to all want this chaos which is funded by Soros. This seems to be an offensive to try and scare Voters away because Dems are frightened of 4more years of Trump and the truth coming out. If Biden is elected lol the DOJ investigations stop
This what we can expect if Biden is elected. They will use the voter registration lists to persecute all of us. Come to the ranch Kamala I will stack y‚Äôall like cordwood. Then we can feed em to the hogs.
Has anyone on here ever had a call polling asking whether you are going to vote for Trump or Biden??? I am an old guy and have had the same number for 25 years and in all that time I have never been called by a pollster, has any of you??? Please ask around.
Definitely finally joe Biden gave a full and very accurate description of himself ..!! #JoeBidenIsARacist #JoeBidenIsNotWell #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmericaCompletely agree, YS.

Where? What photos?!? You can‚Äôt just turn this into a ‚Äúlook at Biden‚Äù thing to distract from Trumps pedophilia! Biden was not photographed on at least 60 occasions or more with sexual predators! Give me a break!
Nope. This is exactly why Biden should not have said he was going to pick a woman. Every racist and sexist mofo in the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù media and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Twitter are showing their ü©≤
I‚Äôm trying to find 1 single actual thing that Biden actually supports in there. Can‚Äôt seem to find A SINGLE POINT. Why don‚Äôt you take your time and actually read his policies?
Not bashing Bass. I refuse to drag a woman of color that is up for VP   But üëáüèæ may be a problem for Biden‚Äôs core base, black church women. Some may see Scientology as too fringe. They are not as feral about mixing faith &amp; politics as white evangelicals, but faith does play a part
It doesn't matter who the Democratic Candidate is they will always find something to bitch about.  For the mess we are in right now, Biden is perfect to make this horrendous experiment of Anti-Democracy go away.  Sign way any of the Trump ignorance &amp; right this ship.
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!
Where is Hunter Biden now? When will he admit to his crimes?

‚ÄúBut Biden doesn‚Äôt need a Black VP, he‚Äôs already got the Black vote.‚Äù As if Black people exist only for political purposes?? -_-
With the way 2020 has gone so far, do we really know who the Presidential candidate for each party will be? What's to say that either or both Trump and Biden have colossal physical or mental breakdowns.
Biden targets religious voters. But has there ever been a more tortured twist of scripture than to equate redemption and restoration with Marxism and socialism?

How cute that you dream of that. Truth is it‚Äôs a different landscape this election hillbilly. Trump is the incumbent, everyone knows him now. Biden is not Clinton, he‚Äôs not even remotely as unpopular as she was. She was MUCH more unpopular than Trump was

What you fail to realize is that people disliked Trump, but really really really hated Hillary. You laugh at Biden, but he is no Hillary, as showcased by Trump‚Äôs fails at labeling him, or making a chant like ‚ÄúLock Her Up‚Äù, or the fact that Sleepy Hoe gathered no attention..
So Biden could become the second. He speaks Jibberish. That counts right?

We dont want Joe Biden as President. They are both crooks. One has be3n around for 50 yrs and hasnt done shit for the American people. All of a sudden a new guy comes along that knows everything about all the Democrats and now the democrats are squirming!! Obama is Satanic

There is not one SANE black woman, whether they are Skateboards, KHive, Petedctyls, Latter Day Lizzies, No Malarkies,Kloubacharians, Castrations, Gang of Yang, or Booker Tees (Branch Bernardians are not sane), will be hurt or pissed if Biden chooses a qualified black woman or WOC
Is that the statement where Biden implied Trump was Xenophobic for restricting travel from China?
This is a false equivalence, Sis. For one thing, there is not one SANE black woman who will be pissed or hurt if Biden picks another black woman or a WOC(except, maybe black Latter Day Lizzies, and even with them, I am not comfortable making them an exception)

Love is in the air. Joe Biden really loves his grandchildren.
I believe Biden is being led by the arm, without a mask, without having been tested for COVID-19, from a room with many unmasked people. I think this is his granddaughter who he kisses on the lips frequently.
And that is the scary part! People planning to vote for Biden have no idea who will really be running the country. Biden‚Äôs handlers would be able to do as they please without repercussions.

Bernie hasn‚Äôt ‚Äòcheated‚Äô on anyone. He ran a strong campaign, but SC and the American voter decided that getting rid of Trump was more likely with Biden as the nominee. Everything we hate about the Demstablishment is way way worse under Trump, so, we prioritize. That‚Äôs real life..

but mediocre ain't killing anybody - we're headed to a ( more) socialistic state for sure - 'trumpism' is not slowing this down - it's accelerating it - moderate Biden will now be liberal as hell. White folks need to admit ha - our reign of good (us) and terror (not us) is over
The real issue is what would another four years of tRump do? Even if you hate Biden with a passion - you still have no choice but to vote for him IMO
This isn't Biden or Trump's America. It's our America and we need to fix it now. This is unacceptable in every way.Completely agree, YS. This will be a huge problem for Biden if he picks a Scientologist to be his VP.  I do wonder why this is just coming out now, though.
Where? What photos?!? You can‚Äôt just turn this into a ‚Äúlook at Biden‚Äù thing to distract from Trumps pedophilia! Biden was not photographed on at least 60 occasions or more with sexual predators! Give me a break!

Not bashing Bass. I refuse to drag a woman of color that is up for VP   But üëáüèæ may be a problem for Biden‚Äôs core base, black church women. Some may see Scientology as too fringe. They are not as feral about mixing faith &amp; politics as white evangelicals, but faith does play a part

The kids are too fucking stupid these days. They will just keep using it. They don't care. They just want to watch each other eat tide pods!! Pretty much sums up Biden fans too
I get why Biden voters act so weird now!! Their not from America! It makes sense
Their both crooked as hell!! Ones been there 3.5 yrs, the other one has been there for 40 plus years!! Now, common sense tells you one thing!! Dude has not done shit!! In 40 yrs. I dont care what Trump has done. Save our country!! Dont give it to the Chinese like biden wants!
Calm down, please Just because a person doesn‚Äôt agree 100% doesn‚Äôt mean they are dumb or need to leave
This Democrat is voting Red!!! Blood red too!! I mean Red cuz if your voting for Biden, you voting to become like China! Facts. Dems never did anything but legalize weed. Bout it!! Oh and Gay b.s
I've notice. Biden Voters are fucking weird. I almost wonder how many real accts there actually are
Trump retweeting Russian trolls. How typical. Can't wait til November. Biden will work to help Americans rather than tweet Putin propaganda.
Please ask  if he will be helping Joe Biden with debate prep, or if he has been supplanted by Alec Baldwin. :-)
It‚Äôs my kind of town! Votes Biden 2020.
I DONT CARE WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE!! BIDEN IS TOAST
Biden is a very very weak Presidental candidate
Of course Talib will not endorse Biden. She needs Confederate Caligula and Trumpfederates in the media to keep her useless ass relevant  Talib is the nastiest, the most intolerable, bitter, and useless  of Squadders. She‚Äôs like the üëáüèæ of (AOC)Josie and the Pussycats
What makes the media so fucking egregious is that they use Kamala &amp; Beto as shitstools and an ‚Äúexample‚Äù to promote two of the most overrated racially insensitive frauds in the party  And they won‚Äôt stop until Warrigieg split DNA to become Evita and Juan
She was supposed to show remorse for her remarks in the debate? She was practically angelic compared to other attack dogs in debates. Experienced politicians know all's fair in this game. Warren was at least as aggressive as Harris. Biden gets it. This is a non-story.
Still don't care!! Ex Democrat!! Biden and them can't win!! All will go to hell!! Sew how China is!! Thats how America will turn!! Mark my words
Its funny how much biden voters don't know what's next!! They dont call him China Joe for nothing
BIDEN IS TOAST!! #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDE
Well just create diversity and well get all of the #BLMTerrorists and #lgtbqterroists to vote for Joe!! That aught to get biden in the White house even though he's been there for 40 yrs and hasn't done a thing üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉü§£ü§£ü§£
This November he sure will be!! He will go from V.p of 1st term to V.p of 2nd term!!! If you don't vote for Trump your doing nothing, but harm!! China Joe Biden and the Dems want to ruin America like Obama did!! Its all about money. I use to hate Grump too!! Ex dem
Oh Loretta I HEAR YOU!  In TX my whole life Why do red people feel the need and the right (no pun) to pontificate?!? We have our Biden sign out loud &amp; proud though
China Joe Biden! Quit Hiding, Beijing Biden!! We know who you roll with!!
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Lmao!! Yessss!!!! To be from D.e.t and be a Biden fan blows my fucking mind!!! Guess you ride with China
#Trump2020 If you vote for China Joe Biden you are voting for China to become the next world dominant leader by 2030!! You dont realize that do you???!!!! Do your homework. The Democrats are evil and want to divide this Country!! Pls do your home work. The media lies!!
So I saw this sign pop up in my neighbors yard, they are strong rep and out of town .I texted them and someone put it on their lawn as a prank so of course I asked if I can have it .. so now I‚Äôm proudly displaying my Biden sign that was paid for by a Republican... feels so good.
If you want China to be the World Dominant country by 2030!! Vote Joe China Biden!! Mark my words! The Democrats are not for America. They are for a different Agenda! I will never vote democratic again! I dont care what Trump did. Man is our only hope!!
FYI Spotify didn‚Äôt recognize the link.  It I searched Women for Biden on Spotify and found this and another playlist. üòä
Sure!! You wish China Joe Hidden!! At this point anyone can see this is gonna be a disaster for you Jo3! We dont grust you or the DEMOCRATS AGENDA!! IF YOU WANT CHINA TO BE WORLD DOMINANT!!! VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN CUZ THAT'S THEIR PLAN! DEMOCRATS SOLD AMERICA FOR MONEY
If not as VP, you have to be a part of Biden‚Äôs clean up plan.
Please. Then actually bounties will be made and Hunter Biden will be insured he gets dads cut.
I would swap out Demings for VP and Harris as AG. Def Warren at HHS. Agnostic on Rice. Since you asked. But Biden doesn‚Äôt listen to me so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
Not true!  The left voting for Biden are the anarchists in our streets right now destroying our country!
Biden would piss his pants in the first 5 minutes!
First high-profile Republican defection to Biden comes from swing-state Ohio
I just wish we could all wake up and see that the real problem is our two party system. We get two picks either a racist who let thousands die during the covid pandemic for the economy or a ‚Äúformer‚Äù racist pedophile. Why are these our only two choices?
Please name one thing Joe Biden has done to improve America in 49 years,. waiting.  Have you seen the videos of Biden sniffing young girls? look at his children. What kind of person raises scum like that? Any opportunity to sell and influence another person is golden why pass up?
If Biden picked any of those ladies it would only hurt him. They all are  leftist fanatics... he wants something in the middle
Keeping the crazy in the family. What is it about Biden you support? all his racists statements? his sniffing young girls? the way he's raised his sons -- creepy perverts like ol' Joe.  Please point to something positive other than the D behind his name.
American mayhem: More rioting and lawlessness in cities across US   Welcome to Democrat America and 4 years of this under Biden.
Way better than old fart Biden could doü§£ü§£ü§£
Biden couldn‚Äôt throw a bounce ball 10 feet!  ü§£ü§£ü§£
You mean Biden right?  He‚Äôs already thereü§£
Per  üëäüèª  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Biden is the puppet...what is scary are who is holding the strings!
Yup, that‚Äôs the hellscape we live in now. And it‚Äôs terrrible. It‚Äôs going to take more than Biden winning, more than a Blue Wave to stop this. A serious cultural change is needed.
Treasonous Tiberius accepted donations, including the ELECTION, from Russia, but you don‚Äôt hear Nicolle Wallace using unemployed civilian, HRC, as shitxample to ask Biden a ridiculous bullshit question  And if you are going to orgasm out Beto‚Äôs name, at least pronounce it right
I sure hope the Biden campaign hook  up for all these awesome videos he is tweeting out. Love this!
You can‚Äôt blame Trump for China‚Äôs virus they unleashed on the world. Else you blame every leader in the world. And if communties don‚Äôt care when they burn down their own homes and businesses that‚Äôs just a mental deffency. Oh that may be Biden!
Yes, our Country could be lost forever if Biden is elected President. He wouldn‚Äôt actually be president he‚Äôd be run by the Democratic Socialists like AOC, Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley.
I‚Äôve told you before I hate both of them. Put me straight down the middle. I think he‚Äôs done some good and done some bad. And I think Biden will be good and bad. We are fucked no matter what bro
Come on Sid. You know the questions Biden gets are just as soft &amp; you know I‚Äôm not a trump guy. I will say that was a good one and made me laugh.
battles.  9. Always remember, cable media doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck they are talking about. Especially about black voters.  10. Donate &amp; volunteer for down ballots. We need more than Biden. We need local, state, House, &amp; Senate to escape the 30% holding us hostage
thing to say), and not welcome ANY opportunity for Little Elm Community Theatre theatrics on the House Floor, then I have levees to sell you. Anytime a Trumpfederate attacks AOC, a Dem gets a wing.  8. If Biden asks Norman Bates to speak at the convention, let him. Going /6
Don‚Äôt worry Stephen, we know how you feel and also wonder how in the world you could support Biden or any democrat these days.  Never understand it....
Outside of Twitter and national media, not many care who Biden picks for VP. His pick will not make much of a difference now. It may in 2022 and 2024, though
Biden and schiff
Biden is in a perfect position in the polls to pick someone he is comfortable and confident she is ready to take the wheel   Harris, Rice, or Duckworth  I would add Warren but her hypocritical faux feminist, self entitled cult would fuck this up for Dems
Finally, a good headline
Just like all Trump does is talk about Obama, Hilary and Biden?! ü§£ Hypocrisy!
Sounds pretty accurate!!! Especially if Biden won, which he won't. Just saying, the DEMOCRATS are playing games!!! They will cheat and lie to get what they want! #DemocratsTheEnemyWithin
TIME TRAVEL WITH TRUMP?...good Biden slogan ha.. Trump fixer Cohen in 2015-  "By the very definition, you can‚Äôt rape your spouse.‚Äù Indeed, mid 70's all 50 states said no biggie, as late as '92 a few still said no problem!  Exemptions still exist wow. Go back? or move forward?
Because a vote for Biden is a vote for China!
Obama the worst president our nation ever survived along with his do nothing VP Biden.
What about senility and cognitive decline in Biden?  Can you really not see it? Why would anyone elect a president who is senile?
Biden didn‚Äôt do shit when he was in congress 50 years!  What‚Äôs different now?  He‚Äôs part of the SWAMP!!!
Yea Biden will be the dog right???üòÇüòÇ
And what does senile old Biden know about the virus?  He‚Äôs too senile to understand anything!
Yes Biden is the dog right???üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump gives me more hope then Biden ever could cause he knows how to rebuild the economy - built the best in the world bf the China virus and will do it again!  Biden will send all the jobs to China like him and Obama did before !
Nope that‚Äôs trump!  He wants to help with the destruction going on in the Democrat run cities!  Biden has said nothing about the anarchists and wants to defund police!
No one has been better to the military than trump!  Biden and Obama cut our military down to nothing!  Trump rebuilt it!  FACT!!!
Nope!  Trump‚Äôs already on that!  Dems don‚Äôt want their kids in school.  They want them to be stupid and lazy so they can fall in line with the socialists under Biden!
Honestly it‚Äôs baffling how you try to impeach the President on ‚ÄúQuid Pro‚Äù with lies. Then support Biden who‚Äôs Quid Pro was caught on video. Those people seriously need a helmet.
#TrumpsGestapo isn‚Äôt helping his poll numbers #Corruption in the WH is ongoing. We need to #VoteBlue2020  #Biden2020  #Biden  #BidenPledgesAllegianceToUS
Glad someone is stopping the Gestapo from arresting journalists... now we need to stop them from grabbing Americans off the streets in secret! #Biden2020  #Biden  #VoteOutTheGOP  #VoteOutEveryRepublican
Watching  shut it down on #Maddow.  I am strongly against ‚ÄúVP MUST be a WOC‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúVP HAPPENS to be a WOC.‚Äù However, it makes sense if Biden chooses a Red State Dem as VP: to flip, give confidence to LARGE fraction Dems take for granted,&amp; win Red State leftists
I‚Äôm not surprised or worried about Biden. It‚Äôs not complacency saying he‚Äôs got this. Even if he picks Cersei Lannister as VP  But we need to win that Senate &amp; get Tyrant Turtle out of there. Also allow Human Phoenix RBG retire in peace Let‚Äôs do our best to win red states in reach
Biden leads in the polls: Could they be missing something?
Nikki: November; hotly contested Biden win. Dem congress breaks law and appoints the speaker of the house as president. Trump vacates White House due to threats from terrorists. Pelosi is President. Game over. America is destroyed.
Biden campaign clarifies claim Trump ‚Äòfirst‚Äô racist president, after past slave owners noted
How Biden threatens Trump‚Äôs fortune
CCP is the enemy and the Biden‚Äôs are in with China. Deep!!#FNC #fbn #NPR #STATE DEPT.
Why waste the money on a losing cause. Can we go ahead and just place Biden in DC now?
I dont care what he has done!!! No one wants the Satanic Dems to win!! Biden has no chance at all! Remember the words the silent majority when your pissed off after the elections!!
Just 2 satanic PEDOPHILES having a convo about how they will screw the world over even more if Biden were to win!! He won't though.
Sure!!! You look religious! If you believe in God there is no way you would want to vote for Biden. They are all part of a Satanic culture. Democrats are. They started the Kkk because the Republicans allowed the first black ppl in congress. The dems are evil.
Lmao!!! Cnn has you all brainwashed. Its sad how many ppl just  cant see the truth!! Look at what Obama and Biden did??
No Biden signs or bumper stickers seen.
Biden campaign clarifies claim Trump ‚Äòfirst‚Äô racist president, after past slave owners noted
So the Senator is saying that Trump will have caused the demoralization of 40 million Americans, and a depression in our economy, and Biden will wake up with the need to fix that, and it is a reason to vote for TRUMP?!?!?  What a weird way to say it.
but mediocre ain't killing anybody - we're headed to a ( more) socialistic state for sure - 'trumpism' is not slowing this down - it's accelerating it - moderate Biden will now be liberal as hell. White folks need to admit ha - our reign of good (us) and terror (not us) is over
The real issue is what would another four years of tRump do? Even if you hate Biden with a passion - you still have no choice but to vote for him IMO
Big issue with Biden is if he wins he's going to be extremely averse to the kind of truth and reconciliation work we need. He's constitutionally averse to that kind of stuff.Keep saying Biden gonna fuck this up.  Hide &amp; watch.
Who‚Äôs pushing politics now Jane! Obama used a eulogy for a Black civil rights leader to promote Biden who has never done a damn thing for the Black community!
Biden 2020 baby!!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ if they‚Äôre voting for Biden they‚Äôre uninformed about everything and getting educated is a slim chance
Where the heck is Joe Biden? He's like vanished off the face of the earth.
Agreed...if she‚Äôs not selected, these leaks are the type of thing that‚Äôll turn off her supporters and possibly suppress turnout...Biden needs to fix this, and fast.
Bro, I‚Äôm gonna checkout for a minute.  Biden gonna fuck this up.  I can feel it.
Trump in Texas: President raises millions and defends oil &amp; gas in Permian Basin visit, vowing, "As long as I‚Äôm your president we will never let anyone put American energy out of business." #TrumpTexas #energy #oil #gas #PermianBasin #txbiz
Biden being used as a pull toy!
Can you imagine being silly enough to put your reputation behind a pedophile crook like Biden!
That‚Äôs why Biden will go another route.
So Biden out here showing his little notepad with Kamala‚Äôs name on it.  He‚Äôs teasing.
Kamala giving shoutout to Howard.  Biden taking her plan.
Just saw a Trump 2020 ad that showed footage of fires and looting with the tag line, "You won't be safe in Biden's America".  LOL!!!  Yeah, that's actually footage of TRUMP'S America!  That's on YOUR watch, big dawg. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Racism is uncomfortable.  Biden needs to own his shit.
Biden gonna fuck this up, so get ready.
Soooo, the Biden/Bass video is a thing.  Ok.
Nadler is willing to discuss about as much as Chicken Biden
I don‚Äôt know which source of news he is watching but it was telling when he said Dr. Jill Biden is just like Grace. He obviously has no clue. Some of us who are voting Nov 3 know different. FYI, polls were correct in 2016. The problem was that people relaxed thinks she had won.
Biden is chicken!
Biden should name his entire cabinet.
Lawd this plug from  talking about how will Trump or Biden lead us out of this moment......can Biden rise to the moment &amp; compete against Trumps skillful use of media.  100 days out &amp; here we go.
I don't understand how you have footage of trump saying that.  said it was a "complete and total lie" when Biden referenced this in a tweet. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Covid_19 #LiarInChief
Biden isn‚Äôt the only old Democrat who‚Äôs showing signs of dementia!
So you want to beat Biden off?
probably so ü•¥üòÇ I just need Biden to stfu before I write Kanye in instead
Trump... jail... Biden... president... joy. That remembering five words thing is pretty easy. #VOTEGOPOUT #TreasonousGOP #RacistGOP #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsAnIdiot #TrumpIsAFailure #TrumpIsALaughingStock
Every poll should have to report the statistics of the poll! If you talk to 100 likely voters and 76 of them are Democrats then how are you surprised when Biden is leading by a few points? Not to mention they should also publish the geographic location for those who were polled
Which has exactly nothing to do with my point. Black women put Biden in play, not BS or EW voters. Black women did it with the expectation he would pursue an agenda that benefits them. What did EW voters do? He‚Äôs already adopted her ideas, selecting her as VP would be pandering.
It‚Äôs not pandering to acknowledge and address the concerns of the constituency that most loyally supported his bid. Pandering would be Biden choosing Warren just to try and secure the  support of Sanders voters.
Trumps the idiot? Have you heard Biden try and formulate a complete sentence??We have to fight! We also have to be this same way with a Biden administration
Is that like police-y? Then Biden is your man!
No PLAN, No STRATEGY from this administration. Trump should resign and let Biden take over! America needs leadership that will slow down the Pandemic just like European counties. #ResignTrump #NoHope
Biden team getting on my nerves with all these damn text messages
Guns don‚Äôt make anyone safer.  The Earth is flat.  The sky is green.  Joe Biden is mentally capable.
The active measures to weaken and divide support for Biden are already in full swing.
So from a purely marketing and "has a ring to it" perspective, which one sounds the best?  Biden/Harris Biden/Rice Biden/Duckworth Biden/Bottoms  #Veepstakes #BidenVP #VPPick
Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
Biden team getting on my nerves with all these emails
I did support Bernie twice but I'm not in a political party because I'm not a brainwash f****** idiot.  I'm not going to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump because they're both right-wing conservatives.  Yes if you don't work you are a leech to society.
... I see so many twitter posts on Kamala Harris - but have y'all taken the time to actually write Joe Biden an email and express your beliefs. I did... maybe if we all do, then he would see the belief the country has in her. Just say'n.
do you mean why anybody would vote dem? sorry i don‚Äôt get the question. but most people see biden as more trust worthy to handle COVID, racial tensions, and the shaky economy rn than trump. and that‚Äôs coming from a FOX poll
I mean, my choice is Kamala. But literally, a Biden and a pile of dogshit is an improvement over Trump/Pence.
Sadly, she would make a GREAT president. Now that being second to the whole issue regarding the job she could do for Biden, this should not even be a question of whether she is the right choice for VP.
‚ÄúI hope to GOD that Joe Biden is taking his multivitamin‚Äù -
This just seems to be so fast and so out of the ordinary,‚Äù said the person, who called it a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù
Please tell me that they are doing mock debates with Biden every single day. The playbook has not changed. Trump is a bully for life.
No doubt. I think he‚Äôs already settled on Harris which is why certain arrogant jackasses like Rendell are speaking out‚Äîto try to shift Biden off his course. Harris is plainly the safest choice bc she‚Äôs been in the burning spotlight
How do we fix the ACA? Biden seems to think his plan is good enough.
UPDATE: Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch
How to Biden not know this? I doubt her name is on any shortlist for VP.
He doesn‚Äôt have a strategy at all! Let alone an adequate one. I almost wonder if he wants to lose so he can remain the whining ‚Äúvictim‚Äù he is- and then hand Biden a country in deep dark trouble. But he will care if one of his family gets sick.
Wait wait... Is Biden hazing his vp picks because he thinks it is tradition?!  XD
Well if you think about it Trump can only have four more years.   with Biden we get four years of his neoliberal policy followed by eight years of his vice president far-right neoliberal policies.   That's 12 years of far-right democratic policy. How do we survive that
Yes - Biden
I would have voted for you over Biden or Bernie! We need your strength, determination and yes AMBITION!!!
I suspect it's more that she spoke at the event and has Scientologist donors? I don't know. I guess we'll find out shortly. Seems really dumb for Biden's team to pick a Scientologist.
Shittle Fuck Biden
In a perfect world, Kamala Harris would be Biden‚Äôs Veep.  Elizabeth Warren would be unavailable because she‚Äôd be slated for Senate Majority Leader, which is far more powerful.
Yup. Can‚Äôt always get what you want....ya get what you needüéµ And Biden is what this country needs for now. To heal.
Welp, you just did Biden a huge favor.
Agreed... we can only hope Biden see's this.
Divisive, unintelligent, foolish, childish, wreckless, beholden to Putin, scorning our allies.   Worst President ever, and soon to be annihilated by Joe Biden.  #BidenLandslide  #bidenlandslide2020
Biden: ‚Äúwin what?‚Äù
Biden boxed himself into a corner when he specifically outlined what he was looking for in a VP. Worse decision thus far.
People telling polls they‚Äôre voting for Biden. Media believes them. But, people sending $ to Trump Campaign. #SmartNews
With no escape or end in sight. Seriously. Unless Biden is elected how are we getting out of this? They aren‚Äôt interested in helping, it‚Äôs insanity.
I hope Ed realizes that Biden actually wants to win and pick like Bass would be a.....
Biden been rubbing people the wrong way for decades.
2/Bass is for M4A, has unique experience as a physician assistant, worked in communities in SoCal for social justice, and was Speaker of the House in California's State Assembly. She's more liberal than Biden and has serious accomplishments. She might be the perfect VP pick.
1/Karen Bass is gaining massive momentum. I think she could be a stellar pick - she won't be the anointed #POTUS candidate in 2024, allows the Democrats to regroup a bit and gives Biden someone focused on the job at hand versus running their own race 4 years later.
N shit.  It would be so dang easy to love instead of hate.

Knock it off Joe [Biden], her parents are RIGHT THERE!
Wtf is wrong with this fool?  If you cannot see the clear differences between Trump and Biden,then please,please ,don‚Äôt vote at all. You are too stupid to vote;far too stupid.
In video message for this, Biden speaks generally about the stakes of the November election but doesn't say anything specific about Texas
Given the jingle blaring over this footage, Biden's search has apparently broadened to include the Mushroom Kingdom demographic
the only way out of all the Biden VP controversy is for him to pick a choice that no one sees coming and everyone will be equally mad at. doubling down on my prediction of Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo
In 5 years, when the majority of economists agree the actual minimum wage TODAY should be $26. All Biden is offering are the usual crumbs.
Biden has foreign policy.
This gives me more hope.  I don't want to get comfortable, I do feel good about Biden.  Peace from a Boomer in Tejas.
This is a proven truth. Don't believe anything the Republican's say about a Democrat and don't fall for dirt on Biden via Ukraine and Barr. We know the rules of the game this time around. Play like a professional.
He's spending time with his family while your dad helps the Joe Biden campaign by doing his normal bat-shit crazy stuff.
Biden is a far more flawed candidate, but Hillary was easier to smear because of misogyny.
Biden's watch???? üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ GOP had the MAJORITY from 2010 on, and they still do. YOU ARE JUST MAKING YOURSELVES LOOK STUPID. AGAIN.
Apparently Demings turned a blind eye to police violence, Harris is too ambitious, and Bass praised a cult. Any other black women Biden op wants to float a Friday trial balloon on?
I know we got into a fight over biden on facebook but can she hook me up too
Single payer isn‚Äôt a fantasy. The ACA is an inefficient and ineffective mess, and Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù does little to address its flaws.
Ok if Fidel Castro doesn‚Äôt disqualify her, certainly praising L Ron Hubbard does? No freaking way Biden can take this risk.
TIL Joe Biden voted in 2005 to alter 11 U.S.C. ¬ß 523(a)(8), making student loans impossible to discharge in bankruptcy.  Hilary Clinton abstained from the same vote.
Hey fellow Democrats, let‚Äôs not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.  Let‚Äôs focus on beating Trump with whatever team BIden chooses.
I didn't know Joe Biden was a kangaroo
Another Alt View: We need to be keeping an eye on Biden‚Äôs campaign staff.  Given his age and mental state, it‚Äôs not like he would really be the one running things, and campaign staff inevitably become White House staff.
Think about that while your guy is stuck 12 points behind Biden.
A small thing but it seems a bit peculiar for generic congressional ballot to be outpolling Biden.
Do you understand game theory, or the theories around incentive-driven behavior?   Because openly settling for Biden inevitably leads to zero change in any scenario I see.
I have this dream that Biden wins, and it‚Äôs safe to take my kid to DC for inauguration - I would love that for so many reasons.
He's too busy stumping for Biden in Texas. I know‚ÄîI get emails from him on a daily basis telling me how much money Trump is spending here.
These are the kind of failed boondoggles you can expect more of from a #CorruptJoe Biden admin, especially with #SleepyJoe taking orders from AOC &amp; Bernie. Outright theft.  Trump administration to recover $200 million from failed Obama-era solar project
She can spend more time sitting next to war criminals at NFL games! Oh no, I'm now a misogynist according to the Limo Liberals supporting Biden, Harris &amp; Warren!
Shouldn't have ever let Biden select a VP
Most progressives are not cultist like the right wing of the democratic party and the right wing of the Republican party.  Why would we support Biden just because Bernie said so? Biden still doesn't support healthcare education or legalization.  He is a pro-business pro prison
She‚Äôs all, no thanks, been there, done that. That‚Äôs why Biden needs to make it a surprise.
Bad fit for Biden, but at least she‚Äôs credible. Senator from our largest state, Prosecutor, State AG, ran for President and was vetted.
I hate to say it but a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.   the progressive half of the party told you guys from the beginning they would not vote for Joe Biden or Mike Bloomberg so don't force those two right-wing f****** on us
HEADLINES: Joe Biden's search for a running mate enters final stretch
How many times do we have to tell you that this kind of propaganda does not work. You and Joe Biden are both far-right Republicans.   You're both borderline fascist and I question your Americaness.
Yet we're supposed to be over the moon for Biden? Ever since Reagan, America has to lower its expectations.
This is an insanely irresponsible and dishonest thing to post. If you have any integrity you would remove this tweet and issue an apology.
Did you even bother to listen to the audio? President Trump says he‚Äôs known her since she was 12. Then whoever he‚Äôs speaking to says ‚Äúmmm she‚Äôs hot‚Äù. At no point does he say anything about being attracted to her then or now.
Ignore the hype.   The media just wants to keep you tuned in.   They know they can do it with fear.  Biden's VP pick could be a garden rake and I will walk through broken glass to vote for him.
who can forget the nonstop chaos and bloodshed that happened when Joe Biden was last in the White House
if biden becomes president he will be blamed for the aftermath of corona virus. just like how they blamed obama for the horrible economy bush gave him.
Susan Rice is a brilliant woman but I would hate for Biden to set himself up for 4 years of Obama-haters' abuse.
UPDATE: House Democrats subpoena Pompeo for documents on Biden's son
That being said, are most people invested in the decision likely to vote for Biden anyway? Yeah.  But I think the race is inevitably going to tighten and the margins could become more important than they appear now.
I love Tammy D. Hope it‚Äôs her! #2020Elections #Biden
My only real VP opinion is that Obama should have taken the opportunity to dump Biden after his first term and make more of a successor pick
Let‚Äôs hope this worst case senario DOES NOT happen. We need #Biden to win in a LANDSLIDE VICTORY!! So #RegisterToVote2020  It‚Äôs VITAL to our country NOT becoming a #Authoritarian Country!  Look up: What Is An Authoritarian Government? Educate Yourself otherwise we‚Äôre ALL DOOMED!!
Joe Biden would never do such a thing.  I dare anyone to prove me wrong.
looking forward to voting for Biden/Enten 2020
#SeduceMeIn5Words  I'm Voting For Joe Biden
How all slanted journalism should be handled.  Any thing outside of proponents and opponents views should be termination up and down the stack
Seriously? Republicans are fighting to end healthcare, increased the 2020 FY deficit to $3.7 trillion, have kids locked in cages and 51 million unemployed Americans who now face eviction. They‚Äôre greatest accomplishment is convincing most registered republicans to vote for Biden.
anyone Biden chooses is going to be a get out the vote for Republicans, but Trump will still not win.  Dems were complacent in 2016.  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!  This is going to a historic vote for the soul of America.
lol enjoy it, when you people pushed Biden on us you knew these old useless assholes came with him! what the fuck do you think Bernie meant by "the Democratic establishment" anyway? hint: it wasn't "southern Black voters"
Note to people earning 1% annual on savings accounts...  This is one month return on major stock indexes:  Also, don‚Äôt ruin this by electing Biden &amp; Democrats.
Into dropping out. Even then they had to be bribed to throw their support behind Joe Biden even though they all talked massive s*** about him during the election.  so once again the wealthy and geriatrics have decided another Democratic race. Putting a far-right Democrat into
That's a good point it's kind of hilarious that African-American geriatrics in Republican states decided the primaries for all of us.   Biden was losing horribly did horribly in every Democratic state. his campaign was a joke until Obama talked all the other right-wing Democrats
Obama is probably pushing Rice. And Clinton pushing Harris. Past behavior and recent meetings hint that Biden will most likely listen to Obama. Biden team can't get over that debate clash with Harris.

He works for Biden
Trump is a symptom of a larger problem that would be exactly the same under Biden. Our wellbeing is not dependant on getting a democratic president. Both options suck, as usual.
‚ÄúRisky‚Äù as in an unknown to the public.  I think a lot of Biden‚Äôs appeal is that he‚Äôs familiar. If it were me, I‚Äôd double down on that instead of taking a chance on other highly qualified but lesser known individuals.
2. It‚Äôs more worrying that Joe Biden appears to be letting his ego play a significant role in who gets picked ‚Äî despite the fact that he keeps marketing himself as a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù candidate and hasn‚Äôt even committed to running for a 2nd term.

When Joe Biden is President I won‚Äôt have to spend 6 months in my house on lockdown and honestly that should be good enough for all our votes.
This bit bothered me:   ‚ÄòBass has reinforced that message by assuring Dem. officials that she has no interest in seeking the presidency herself... That... could assuage concerns in the Biden camp that he might be overshadowed by a running mate positioning herself to succeed him.‚Äô
Hi! The point I want to make is that Ed Rendell doesn't get to decide. Both women and all on the "list" are incredible. I trust VP Biden to make the decision. Don't want to tear each other down!
Hands down, she the best pick with regard to: experience, ability, loyalty, compatibility, and leadership. She also brings a star power that energizes the base. There are many talented potentials, but Biden &amp; Harris seem to make a good team to me

Criticism is part of campaigning. I don‚Äôt recall if it was during the debates but I do remember Biden specifically attacking Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúlack of experience‚Äù as a vulnerability. It obviously wasn‚Äôt held against him when the VP pick was made.
Eh maybe, but maybe trump wins Florida no matter what. Biden bass is a safe boring ticket that progressives and moderates both can support. The only reason ‚Äúboring‚Äù didn‚Äôt work in 2016 is because ppl hated Hillary.
Biden is a far worse candidate, but Hillary is a woman...
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve polled her comments and their impact on voters there along with focus groups. My guess is that considering Obama/Biden visited Cuba and normalized relations, nobody cares.

Yes this. If Biden picks a progressive it proves the progressive platform as legitimate. With all this talk of ‚Äúelectability‚Äù having a progressive VP marks progressives as electable.

I must say, Biden relying on Chris Dodd to help select his VP is just atrocious and gross. Yeah, I'll vote for the guy, but fuck.

This is not a risk worth taking at all. We also have no idea how Bass will perform under the bright lights of a national campaign. She was already a big risk. Harris is by far the safest and I think Biden picks her.
I understand why many people still feel like voting for Biden means compromising on your values, but I can't help but wonder how many tens of thousands of people wouldn't be dead in the ground right now if literally anybody else was in charge. Anybody.

The race will tighten and we have to compensate for enormous voter suppression and literal vote stealing that I‚Äôm convinced will happen. Biden needs every possible advantage; selecting the most effective VP at driving vote is hugely important. That‚Äôs Harris. It‚Äôs a no brained
We think ur talking abt Obama actually: he took ur R Great Recession and made America work again. Wow. Ronna. All ur TPs r falling flat b/c it's no longer 2016. Biden knows what Trump doesn't: how to make it work. Not how to kill 150K people.

Dude you are not going to convince me that N1 H1 was mishandled by Obama /Biden and Trump/Pence have not been massively incompetent in handling Covid. There are far more intelligent and insightful things to read about on Twitter. I am done with you.
Which is hilarious because Joe Biden is a right-wing Republican you extremist have nothing to be afraid of he is one of you.  He is so pro-business and has held very racist views his entire life.  So I'm going to say you don't know what the f*** you're talkin about baldilocks
Wrong. It absolutely matters in a close election. Especially when the lead candidate is as old as Biden. And especially on GOTV
This is wrong. Not a traditional one but will be endless online and media events. Imagine Harris being pissed and all her supporters too. Biden can not afford that
Hunter Biden: Graduated from Yale Law School. Served in the Navy. Overcame horrible drug addiction. Has struggled in his life. Buried his mom, his sister and his brother.  Eric Trump: Lives off of his daddy, has no skills and attacks family members of politicians  Fuck you, Eric.
Also, the thing that gives Trump temporary immunity from prosecution *isn‚Äôt* the White House. It‚Äôs the presidency. At 12:00 pm on 1/20/21, Trump‚Äôs *presidency* ends, regardless of whether he‚Äôs still physically in the WH at that moment. President Biden will have the SS remove him.
Biden wants to win more than anything else. That means Harris.
I disagree. I think Rendell is an arrogant ass who is trying to gain a tactical advantage over others close to Biden pushing Harris. Biden needs Harris to fully support him on trail; he‚Äôs not going to publicly undermine her. IMHO
Simpatico is important but a flexible concept. There‚Äôs no evidence that Biden so dislikes Harris he won‚Äôt pick her. JFK hated LBJ but picked him bc LBJ was best political pick. I don‚Äôt think Biden even dislikes Harris; and she‚Äôs the best/safest option electorally
But he will lose, and he will go to prison after. This is why I think Trump‚Äôs gonna skip the inauguration. He knows that he will be indicted the second Biden is sworn in, so I think after the election, he‚Äôll just move to Mar-a-Lago full time and enjoy his last days as a free man.
She‚Äôll need to convince some Biden voters to stick with her. She shouldn‚Äôt be paying money to broadcast the campaign contributions allegation to people cynical about politicians. She should be highlighting her anti-Trump votes, like saving ACA. And her delivery is halting.
It‚Äôs allies trying to generate pressure ag Biden‚Äôs decision making. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an effort to create an excuse for Biden to justify a decision he‚Äôs made against Harris; I think it‚Äôs the opposite. If he weren‚Äôt going to pick her, he knows he needs her support on trail. IMO
Biden is NOT trashing Harris. It‚Äôs certain ‚Äúallies‚Äù who want to stop him from picking her.
But if Dodd is so close to Biden why would they be leaking negative info on Harris if she wasn‚Äôt going to be picked? It‚Äôs gratuitous. They‚Äôre leaking all fbis bc they think Biden will likely pick Harris
Hunter Biden: Graduated from Yale Law School. Served in the Navy. Battled a horrible drug addiction and overcame it. Has struggled in his life and has buried his mom, his sister and his brother.  Eric Trump: Lives off of his daddy, has no skills and trolls family members
No Donnie #TrumpVirusKills150K it‚Äôs too much for you, Mr. Biden wil take over, he‚Äôll fix what you couldn‚Äôt #BidenHarris2020
I think the reason certain ‚Äúallies‚Äù are doing that is to try to stop a decision that Biden has likely already made. If Biden was not going to likely pick Harris I don‚Äôt think any of this would be happening.
Biden is going to pick Harris. If not her, it will be Rice.
Kamala Harris is the obvious choice for VP. Highly accomplished, youthful, vibrant, joyful, highly qualified, a perfect balance for Joe Biden, with a long history of civil rights work and accomplishments.  Black Women are long over-due for a seat at the table.
Love the shirt &amp; I'm with you for Yang 2024.  But for now make sure to vote for Biden so we can like...still have elections and stuff by then.
Thinking biden is going to do anything for you is real privilege
#EpsteinFiles is trending with a ton of Russian trolls (Biden v Trump) dropping ignorant talking points to suck unsuspecting (dumbass) Americans into fighting with one another. Not that we need any help but it‚Äôs low hanging fruit for the Russians.

In the last week, I've received half a dozen emails from Biden + Warren using the royal "we" and talking about "our program for the US". I've received none from Biden + Harris. Make of that what you will.

had a working relationship with Biden &amp; can help us rebuild our relationships with our allies.
It‚Äôs probably worth noting though that Biden actually hasn‚Äôt fixed any of his mistakes yet. He‚Äôs just getting around to admitting they were mistakes, and he says he‚Äôs going to fix them, but he also has a history of compulsive lying.
Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Most Trump voters say they will not accept the 2020 results if Biden wins because of mail-in ballots   call the arm forces to have him removed.
"As president, Biden will lead the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example, by ensuring the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050."  Yeah, that's called gradual change. Its more permanent.
LOL, that's odd...Democrats are very progressive compared to republicans...Did not think a "bridge" was needed for within the party, unless you think Biden administration will be very moderate?  Seems unlikely

A wonderful thread about Joe Biden‚Äôs kindness and decency in action. About how Nov. 3 isn‚Äôt just about voting against Trump (though he has thoroughly earned that repudiation), but also about voting FOR Joe Biden.
Yes because tulsi ended up endorsing Biden too. My point is its an issue that Bernie and Tulsi feel the need that they have to endorse a politician who they don't align themselves with.
I think maybe the best thing is to just donate to the Biden campaign directly without merch

I like things that work. There‚Äôs a yawning chasm between Biden‚Äôs history of poor judgment‚Äîand his capitulation to Republicans‚Äîand what is possible with true leadership.
That doesn‚Äôt change that Biden himself wrote one of the worst bills in modern history, personally campaigned for it, risked VAWA to get it passed, and defended it right up until it became politically detrimental to do so. He still uses very similar ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù rhetoric today.
when China takes over unions will go away to re-education camps. if Biden gets in, he'll cave.
I'm positive, 100% of the democrats who love America more than the  won't vote for  On the same note Joe Biden shouldn't represent us or win if he doesn't endorse #M4A.
Thank you for backing Biden. Is he the most competent, the most inspiring? No he's not. But he is a solution to Trumpism. We have to take America back! We need America to be the shining city on the hill. Right now we have zero moral authority. Our "leader" is an amoral fool.
We all got the tax break! It wasn't much but it helped our middle class family.  Take a look at your taxes! Biden will increase them.  Go on believing CNN.
Joe Biden is senile and wouldn't even know he's at a restaurant.

how did Joe Biden create the job of Vice President
Furthermore, I wrote about the need for Biden's running mate to be a technically competent administrator, as well as a refined political agent. I said that Biden should live in the mind and the Vice President should take care of the day-to-day functions of the civil services.
I see Biden is still trying to sell ‚Äúaccess‚Äù to ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù health insurance as universal healthcare. The quotes in the headline should have clued you in.
Donate it to biden  That clinton was on epstein‚Äôs plane and went to the island is not news. I suspect you know that.
VAWA was a bipartisan, uncontroversial bill. Citing it as a major accomplishment speaks volumes. What is significant is Biden appending VAWA to the draconic ‚Äúmass incarceration‚Äù bill that Biden wrote and campaigned for, to make voting against the bill politically difficult.
Sour that he couldn't be bothered to apologize to Biden though. Just because  couldn't see the signs and thought it was a unsubstantiated claim, everyone else could. Lo and Behold, henry was wrong. No apologies though. Spineless.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be racist. My best friend is black.‚Äù  Obama picked Biden to appeal to ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù who might be uncomfortable voting for a black man with a history as an organizer. Obama didn‚Äôt even like Biden, avoided campaigning with him, and famously called out his stupidity.

No, it isn‚Äôt. You know the ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù is just another health insurance plan with as yet unspecified premiums, copays and deductibles, right?  And look to who Biden surrounds himself with. You think they‚Äôd let him make it cheap enough to put them out of business? Unlikely.
Imma take his money then vot for biden
Very similar upbringing here. Still have relatives talking about any potential COVID vaccine as the "mark of the Beast" and a sure harbinger of the end times. Not sure if they've transferred the role of AntiChrist from HRC to Biden yet.
Take healthcare. Obama ran on a public option with the idea it would be a step toward universal healthcare, but in office he failed to deliver. Now Biden insists that true universal healthcare is a "pie in the sky" idea, and his public option will leave out millions of people.
Nobody cares about Hunter because unlike your daddy, Joe Biden does not plan to put his family in his administration.

Remember when we all had to line up behind the safe moderate‚Äîour only hope against Bush‚Äîbecause who could imagine a prez worse than Bush? Now Dems retweet Bush like he's a good guy.  Biden's going to win, the window will shift right again, and the next R will be worse than Trump.
Biden is also on board with the fascist status quo. He's spent his entire career expanding police power and reducing police accountability.
So does that mean that you all aren't allowed to complain when Biden continues sending feds to arrest "anarchists"?
There are people in this very thread saying Biden should court Rs because their votes are negotiable. If everyone to Biden's left‚Äîand that's the vast majority‚Äîpromises their vote, no strings attached, there's no reason for Biden not to double down as a center-right candidate.
I hear people saying we need to push Biden left so he supports progressive goals, but what mechanism do we have for that if we pledge away our vote‚Äîour only bargaining chip‚Äîin exchange for nothing?
I‚Äôm ok w delaying the elections, as long as, trump vacates the White House on Jan 19, ‚Äò21 and Biden moves in the next day.

I think this changes the trajectory of American politics. Nearly every candidate, except Warren, was for keeping the filibuster. No more. If Biden wins but doesn‚Äôt nuke the filibuster, the 2022 midterms will make 2010 look like a picnic.
The filibuster must be killed in the first 48 hours of a Dem senate. Otherwise Biden and a Dem congress pass almost zero consequential legislation. Any Dem who opposes killing the filibuster must be forced to read the federalist papers and forced out of the party if they resist

All candidates, including Biden, stood next to you on debate stage openly supporting the DNC power to pick any candidate they like over the candidate with the most number of delegates or votes.
We can properly push against the Left's total capitulation to Biden with an alternative, can discuss in safe state campaigning as a 3rd or 4th ask, and get DSA members to get over their fear of running from the Democrats. If you want to ever break, you'll have to get messy.

Reagan asked are you better off than you were 4 years ago?  Biden can ask, are we better off now than we were 4 months ago. More than 150 thousand dead, 3x Vietnam war losses, our economy reduced by one third. We did not make America great again under Trump, we made America less.
warren may have been confirmed to be Biden's running mate in an email to ppl on Warren's mailing list Biden is going to hold a "virtual discussion on his plan to win this November" this probably won't happen but it's looking pretty likely
Why, yes it will. Because you‚Äôll be in prison, and Joe Biden will be president.
Yes, vote Biden to get America back.
1. Biden isn‚Äôt a dictator. Im a Bernie supporter üíØ and not a Biden fan but trump has caused more death than Biden could. I was on the not voting Biden train till covid. We can‚Äôt do another 4 years under trump. Democracy won‚Äôt survive here and you know it.
correction, after trump/biden
Bullshit. A left swinging VP will unite an extra 2 million votes to Biden‚Äôs left. Until then they‚Äôre going Green.
I agree. However, the Trump, Pence, Biden, (Pelosi), Schumer gang does not bode well with your desire.  They control the politics/power.  That‚Äôs the problem.  Dem  ‚Äúanswer‚Äù is a rich old white man who has been in the political system forever. Where is the progressive movement?
Brie please endorse Biden
Take your Anti- American BS somewhere else. You are behind and Trump will crush Biden.   The Democrats are evil and America knows it.
The only thing worse than Biden pretending to be left-wing is the idiots on the right taking him at face-value.

Not on her life. This house remembers the depravity and lies of her and Bill‚Äôs time in office. Biden is no option. They know that. Who is going to be their ditch and switch?
Even w/o any delay, I won't be surprised if Trump doesn't try to contest enough EVotes to keep Biden from getting to 270 (cf. 12th A.) &lt; their deadline to throw the election to the House. That's where he needs the decision to land. It's bullshit, but then it's Trump.

I mean Biden wasn't my first choice, but he's not going to be a drama queen all of the time. Trump is dangerous. I want Biden to just be boring. I can't wait for a boring President, so my biggest concern will be the Cowboys, Mavs, and Longhorns.

Joe Biden would agree I bet
Biden will NEVER debate President Trump.
Gotta keep the scare up to get Perv Biden elected
If some states send in two states of electors, then Congress will decide which slates of electors are legitimate, and Congress will make that decision on 1/6 when it counts the EC vote. If Democrats control both houses, they can choose the Biden slate of electors in those states.
Wholly inadequate response by President Biden! He should be impeached immediately.
So... The Left.   Biden is a self-described moderate.   You keep going back to describing political views through the filter of what candidates people support. Maybe try looking at actual policy instead?
President Trump has been described as the most pro-life President in history, but....  "Joe Biden promises to undo Trump-era pro-life policies if elected president"
This is pretty much my take.  I may disagree with Biden but I don't think he's GONNA FUCKING KEEP SHOVING HIS HEAD INTO A BURNING TRASHCAN LIKE THIS FUCKING ASSHOLE.  "He won't affect the change I want."  I feel that. But... right now we have sheer fucking incompetence.
I will add, agree that we NEED someone in office who pulls us together (no, Trump isn't that option), thanks Biden for the obvious. Seriously though,  's has a point I need to research. Not that it's impacting my vote on getting lies/arrogance out of office.

I didn‚Äôt say white people are bad. I said white old men hold a dangerously disproportionate amount of power in this country. You want to talk about Biden‚Äôs policies, for some reason when I‚Äôm talking about systems of power and oppression such as predatory lending.
Trump is putting his ignorance on display for all to see.  He doesn't control the elections, the states do.  Even if the red states postponed their elections, Biden would win the electoral college.
Shouldn't be.  Remember when Biden made this point, and he was lambasted for it?
Also, fyi, I never stated I knew of any conversation taking place. If you had any reading comprehension skills, you'd know it was a response to the clown who claimed Biden had no power to do anything. Let me show you so you don't have to do any excruciating work.
Because I want trump to lose and while its true that libertarians typically take votes from Republicans we can not risk the possibility of trump having an other electoral college victory. If you aren't happy with trump then Vice President Biden is the only real choice.
You don't know what possibilities are do you? I never moved any goalposts. He clearly did not have a conversation with Obama, but if he did, nothing came of it. I'm sorry clear logic has failed you, but the fact of the matter is that Biden has never mentioned lowering Rx costs.
I'm in Texas doing my best to not catch the virus. I think Texas should have a mail in ballot for "have Covid 19, may die before Election Day"  I will do whatever it takes to get my vote in and hopefully will be here to watch President Biden's Inauguration.
it puts the Biden on the skin or else we get the Trump again
I guess your article on Biden accusing trump of delaying the election was just a little bit incorrect.
So we really have to wait till Biden is sworn in to start doing something about trumpvirus?   Really.    C'mon people.

I didn't make any demands one way or another about Tara Reade. I followed the evidence and came to the same conclusion I do about Elizabeth Croydon‚Äîthere's no concrete evidence either way. There is physical evidence of Biden's proclivities on video. There's the difference.
And what if all the neo-Feminists get their wish, and Harris or Warren is nominated VP then steps in when Biden has to resign for "health reasons"?
FFS. If ever there was a time to put aside petty differences, it‚Äôs now. Harris is the strongest candidate, and she should be Biden‚Äôs choice.
If the best we can do is Biden and Trump, can I have a rain check? At this point I‚Äôm writing in  for POTUS and  for VEEP.

There are two possibilities, either the conversation happened and nothing came of it, or it never happened at all. The point was that Biden could have still done something as VP.
I wonder how many of them will rescind past attacks on Biden for suggesting in April that Trump would float this very thing.
Honestly? I think they're getting them from Facebook and Twitter et al. I'm getting Biden emails to, and the address is not one I've used for political activities. And they refuse to unsub it, as usual.

I got an idea Trump. If you resign now and let Pence take over he'll be the one that loses to Biden in November. It won't be your fault. It'll give you something to gloat over too

I'd like to skip the rest of the year &amp; just move on to the swearing-in of Biden.  Then on day 2 I'd like him to appoint Adam Schiff to set up the equivalent of the Nuremberg Trials for Trump's minions.
If it comes to that, an M-1 Abrams tank or two will make quick work of that wall when President Biden gives the order to fumigate the Whitehouse of any remaining rats.
And I don't see Joe Biden reversing this trend. Perhaps I've misjudged him but his career does not suggest he would. If I were American I would not vote for him.
Great thread. Whole lot of people need to answer for attacking Joe Biden who has proven to be correct.
For all u Trumpers thinking Biden‚Äôs move to not do rallies was a thing to ridicule: think again. The    TP abt this suddenly looks more than careless. it looks downright lethal. Tulsa killed. When will u b/c responsible adults??
I am not a fool and I will be casting my ballot for Biden.
He will never stop. That‚Äôs why, as a Republican, I am voting for Biden. To save our country from his destruction.
Stop holding Americans hostage with fear &amp; chaos. You think you can intimidate us to vote for Biden just to get our lives back, DEMOCRATS ARE TOXIC! Nancy is full of poop!! She doesn‚Äôt care about people -only power. Go eat eat your $18 a pint ice cream &amp; retire please.

This isn't settle. This is compromise. I loved Warren. She has flaws. Others love Sanders. He has flaws. Harris has flaws. Biden has flaws. They are still all very strong candidates. Dems need to realize our problem isn't about settling, but of choosing between great options.

The Secret Service and the military will be under President Biden‚Äôs command starting at 12:00 pm on 1/20/21. President Biden will order the Secret Service to remove Trump from the White House, and then it‚Äôll be over. That‚Äôs it.
Trump wants an election delay in the best interest of the American people? Huh? Trump has never wanted anything for the benefit of anyone but himself. He's setting up an excuse for his likely loss to Biden. Trump is a stable genius at spinning away his zillions of failures.
basically put myself under "house arrest" for months in order to avoid this virus and survive, I WILL GO VOTE ON NOV 3rd if I HAVE TO CRAWL ON MY KNEES OVER BROKEN GLASS THRU CLOUDS OF PEPPER SPRAY AND RUBBER BULLETS. I will vote for Biden And, I was a lifelong Republican.

We've been holding elections in the midst of the pandemic. Chance some would/some wouldn't delay = chaos. But if enough ignore the call for delay &amp; choose electors for Biden, game over. Trump doesn't have influence in states he needs to stop. I.e., it isn't going to happen.
‚ÄúBiden says he wants to heal....the country. That‚Äôs noble aspiration, but he can‚Äôt unify a nation that he...divides by accusing his political opponent of traitorous intent. Biden says he‚Äôs a better man than Trump. Comments such as these suggest that maybe he‚Äôs not
I generally trust people who think about this stuff for a living. At the same time, I can't help but wonder in a morbid way what would happen if the October Surprise were Barr arresting Biden on phoney felony charges.  Could he just throw a bomb at the process without delaying?
FLASHBACK: Conservatives attacked Joe Biden for predicting Trump would try to delay the 2020 election -
That depends on "red state governors" ability to do that under their election laws. But say they miss deadline to designate electors. The process proceeds w/o them: Biden wins. What cannot be put off is end of his term on 1/20/21. If still vacant, Speaket Pelosi becomes POTUS.
My head isn't exploding. As usual, Trump is just talking out of his sizeable a$$. The states make those decisions. All of the red states could delay the vote &amp; Biden would win the Electoral College. Or have no election &amp; Nancy Pelosi becomes POTUS. No worries.
Regardless if it‚Äôs a distraction tactic or not ... those who attacked Biden for predicting this look foolish now
I think we need to acknowledge that Biden will be better than Trump but also be very bad for lots of people, particularly the poor and POC. Which is why we should both 1) Vote Trump out, and 2) Push Biden to make his platform less harmful. These are not contradictory!

EMPHATICALLY! People talk about "voter enthusiasm." About half of Biden voters say their #1 priority is to get Biden elected. The other half says it's to get Trump out of office. Either way, it's enthusiasm.   Also, over 90% of Biden voters say they will never vote Trump.

She didn't win a single delegate because she quit before even starting primaries. She and Biden are easiest and quickest rise to power since Bush 2000.

theres a 0% chance the military sticks their neck out for trump. all the top generals hate him cause hes wont commit to foreign policy stuff like venezuala or iran. why would they want to keep him in when biden is the other option
im not saying that biden is going to save the u.s. but you are vastly underestimating how much trumps bungling of the pandemic is dragging him down
i think biden very likely going to be our next president. im trying to remain bearish on him because we all saw what happened in 2016 but i have no idea what trump would realistically do to save himself from his own mistakes at this point

Indifferent. Maybe a Biden win will be beneficial in terms of Democrats will lower the heat on Bernie supporters. If he loses, we will never hear the end of it. Sort of like no one talks about Hillary supporters who voted McCain because in end Obama won.
AOC never said that. The policies laid out in both AOC‚Äôs GND and Biden‚Äôs plan are the exact same policies advocated by progressives, except Biden‚Äôs plan is $5 trillion less and projected to reach goal in 9 years rather than AOC‚Äôs 12-year plan.

OK, I said I was going to vote for Biden of course &amp; happily &amp; without question, but you're making it difficult.
There's simply not going to be a valid election, and it will heavily favor Trump. I lose my mind every time I see a confident Biden prediction
I‚Äôm not sure why we care about this? Harris would make a great President. It makes sense that whoever Biden picks is likely to be a top choice for President in 2024. It‚Äôs a bit ironic that Biden‚Äôs team would have problems with his VP aspiring to become the President after him...
Don't put too much stock in it, definitely an outlier. Biden is ahead in Michigan, but not by 13.
Yeah, when Trump crushes Biden!
Broken record that wont stick. Do you have any moral regarding what's best for America? Senile-Biden cannot walk without an aid holding his arm yet you want him to lead the country?
This is an excellent point, and I grow weary of explaining it.  If you don't understand how real politics works, then let me help. If you honestly think Biden is against everyone getting healthcare or legalizing pot, you're fooling yourself.

It‚Äôs growing, for sure. I‚Äôve been seeing people with Biden masks, bumper stickers, hats, and shirts, as well as a bunch of yard signs, and this is the last republican stronghold in the state (Fort Worth/Tarrant County)
I want Biden to Add more Justices to the Supreme Court and I want Kamala to be one!!
I hope Biden chooses Karen Bass, or if not Bass, then Val Demings. Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders - CNNPolitics
Those two "advisors" need to move on. We don't need their advice. Biden needs to respond!!
put Juan in his place....BHO and Biden where the reason the hospitals werent ready.
Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre safe. They endorsed Biden. Why should democrats be concerned?
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo over claims he helped advance ‚Äòconspiracy theories‚Äô about Biden   This is Bull. What about the Russia hoax for 3 years from the Democrats. Will they be punished ever
Alien head Biden, lol!
That disappeared like a "fart in the wind" the second a woman said something about Joe Biden.
I‚Äôm not a fan of Trump (I think GOP could have done better) which is exactly where the Democrats are - Biden and Kamala .... Sanders, Warren AOC, Pelosi ... man, your party is as f‚Äôd up as the GOP - but I still choose those in favor of businesses, laws, police and legal migration
Prediction: Biden voters vote by mail and Trump voters in person. Trump only goes by OAN coverage who declare states way early for Trump. He declares victory early and gears up to sue states regarding any change in results.
Before the election, Barr intends to drop a mountain of fraudulent accusations against Biden and other Democrats. Barr and Trump are counting on the media to trumpet this phony report as they did when making Clinton‚Äôs emails the number one story in 2016.

Just just keep drinking Biden‚Äôs milk.  We will keep on truckin‚Äô see you at the polls in a mask.  LOL
LOL i rather be on Train than on Biden‚Äôs nuts.....
Keep saying Biden gonna fuck this up.  Hide &amp; watch.
Joe Biden has 7.5 Mil followers. DT has 84 Mil.  Help a VP out.
I really don‚Äôt care taking a shot at Biden aside that he is unhealthy, he won‚Äôt be able to perform his duties (VP pick will be the president before the term) and he‚Äôs been portrayed as an Angel or capable politician - he is not. I want to vote for the best group, not  the man.
Your a joke Biden
Papa Biden and son alot of fishy business in foreign countries mmmmmmm
I'm voting for Joe Biden no matter who he picks as VP, to be clear. I think who he chooses for VP matters more to people who are either far to his left, or reluctant republicans. Depending on which one of these groups has a bigger issue turning out, the choice has consequences.
Hard no on Rice.  Harris is the safest choice and you don't gamble when you've got a big lead. Slow and steady has served Biden well so far. It's not time to take chances.
What does being a Christian have to do with observing that someone seems to not be well?To be honest, when I heard Biden‚Äôs speech, I was very proud to be an American. He praised our country &amp; our military. I thought he gave a very good speech. In my opinion, he‚Äôs not the same.

Biden Rally at Lewis Funeral!!!! Mask not required! At Church! BYO.........!!???!???!??? Biden not attending. Obamination will be speaking!
That‚Äôs true too. It would be a way out for them. It would be smart, but I think they‚Äôre more likely to blame Biden for everything that happened this year and lie their way out of it. Their base will believe it. They did in 2008.
Sue, I saw Joe Biden in person in 2010 give a speech at the laying of the wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier on Memorial Day. He didn‚Äôt stutter a single time. He actually gave a decent speech praising our military. When I see him today, he‚Äôs not the same person. He‚Äôs sick.
Biden is so tone-deaf I'm pretty sure he'll pick the cop
Whatever!  Biden is a pig!
What are the odds Joe Biden actually tweeted this
Wow, choosing a Lady VP is tough. Maybe Biden should just choose a dude. (Sarcasm).
So if not voting for Biden is a vote for Trump, and not voting for Trump is a vote for Biden, then by that logic, people that vote third party or don‚Äôt vote at all are voting for.... both of them?
Biden didn't need ground support.The Democratic Party elected Biden, not voters.They got everyone else out of the race.Bernie willingly left the fight,just like last time. They elected a dementia patient,and don't care.They're capable of doing anything to defeat Trump. Anything.
Where‚Äôs Hunter Biden?
Interesting and backs up why we cannot believe polls.  We all must VOTE.  Biden's 13-point lead? 'Meh', says Florida
Biden doesn't even know where he is most the time so sure!!
No one is gonna vote for him anyway! Biden wouldn't last another yr
Check out this 2020 election forecast via   #2020election
There is no defense for this terrible President. Supercut Shows Fox Personalities Saying Trump Will Never Do Something. He Just Did.
Regardless, you can‚Äôt point to me enough states that Biden will flip you blue in order to win the election.
Obama:one of histories most vile con men, and the fact that he is so revered by libs demonstrates the hopelessness of a Biden presidency and essentially dooms the US to more of the same .... if Biden wins, hence a worsening of a failed state.
didn‚Äôt sponsor the bill (let‚Äôs assume he did) and the  Clinton, Obama, etc have derided the law as MAJOR failure that targeted minorities (a shitty job at best) - trying to put Biden as wise on the topic is equal to say Trump is the brightest man in earth.
Biden might not even make it to November.  His handlers are having a difficult time keeping him focused and on topic.  It‚Äôs sad what the Democratic Party is doing.  Biden will get destroyed!  Would love to see Joe mumble through his thoughts in a debate!  He is a chicken sh*T
It's a tough call. Biden has been in office longer, so probably in the long run has done more damage. But Obama started a firestorm that will take a long time to recover from.
If Trump is going to not run for re-election, or switch Pence out for Hailey, this would be the time to do it.  Next week is when Biden is going to announce his Veep.  I would expect a Monday announcement if it‚Äôs something major.
It's really kind of sad.  The number of guffaws, mixups, erroneous numbers, etc just continues to grow.  Grandpa Joe needs just hang it up and go enjoy his retirement years and he certainly doesn't have the cognitive skills to be President.
You have a pride flag pfp and support Biden lmao. You do know he was openly anti-gay marriage right?   Libs aren‚Äôt the brightest but come on dude ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Well, this is damning.
biden see ghosts sometimes and i want the world to know :‚Äô)
But Biden called him racist and thought it was the wrong idea when President Trump closed down travel with China. Biden then had to walk back that position. So who was right?

Biden is a mindless puppet....
How about all of them. When my Computer gets a virus, I wipe the hard drive...They're ALL infected..Every last one. You too if you honestly think Joe Biden is some kind of catalyst for change. You are standing in the way..
If we can make it to a Biden Presidency, you will be amazed at  how little it will take to make me happy in 2021.
Where was the social distancing at the funeral? Put on a mask and vote....Dem‚Äôs plan to have their dead family members vote has been found out.....sorry try again!  Biden as president is a no go.
Tell that to the horse that constantly tells people to vote for the other horse when his policies are questioned.  Biden makes himself look bad. Pointing that out is just highlighting the damage he did to himself already.
Biden‚Äôs worse
My money is on DJT supporters any day.  Biden supporters are cupcakes....
Joe Biden is effectively shutting down that debate. He's not interested in single-payer at all. He's said so in so many words.  How the hell is calling him out on that "bad faith"? Your statements are more bad faith than Bri's.
Biden is a puppet...I‚Äôm amazed the left think hes the best candidate.   Riding BHO‚Äôs wave of failed policies.  Can you outlaw the Dem‚Äôs in your second term please?  The time has come for 2 pro-American parties to run.  Thanks for what you do..
The GOP is interfering.....they look greedy and out of touch.  Unemployment and GDP reduction....they are trying to cut the fed money by 2/3 with the belief everyone will just go back to work.  No jobs to go to Jeb...GOP needs to step up or insert Biden, spells disaster.
That wasn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs making but let‚Äôs agree that he was involved &amp; the Bill has been derided by  as a terrible law against minorities - that gets Biden an F- in my book
Find one single law developed and passed by Biden in his 30+ years parasitic Policial life in favor of the police ... it‚Äôs easy to judge Biden for what he did/didn‚Äôt 3 years ago BUT his legacy is beyond the past administration
Biden Makes The Simplest Anti-Trump Promise Ever And People Are Here For It
In eight years of Obama Biden we never saw the kind of violence and hate and division that we‚Äôve seen in the last 3 1/2 years with Trump so that shit don‚Äôt fly

"U.K. Officials‚Äô New Trump Dilemma: What if He Loses?" by Mark Landler via NYT
Yes, well said indeed. I‚Äôd like to see Bernie placed somewhere vital in Biden‚Äôs Administration.  Department of the Interior, maybe, or EPA Director, maybe. Your thoughts, Jim? Anyone?
I would concede that there mightve been a few in 2016... but as for current times, i think they just got tired of seeing all the " Republicans for Biden" stuff, &amp; made it up. üòâ
Another big O scandal. Oops sorry, he‚Äôs not president now. Talk about a bigot, did he forget MULES were a primary source, including Biden, of targeting blacks years ago.

Crap.  The wine got me.  About as much evidence here as opposed to 2 girls and Clinton on a plane. Nothing on Biden or Obama yet.
Unfortunately, sir...you are part of the problem.  You are a career politician and a member of the deep state.  You are just as left and just as crooked as Schumer, Biden, and any other career politician.  #VoteThemAllOut
The same amount of the time as I'm calling women females, but usually only when referencing myself like saying as a male I do such and such where as I would say white females are more likely to vote for Trump where as black males will vote for Biden
Vice President Biden is winning handily. He doesn't need your campaign advice.
Any black person not on welfare and continuing to vote Democrat isn‚Äôt black remember. Biden said so.
Spoiler alert? Kamala Harris outed as Biden's VP pick -- maybe
I see accusations without facts or proof. These canned propaganda stories have been debunked and debunked again. The onion will be peeled back on the dems and we'll talk about corruption. Biden is DEFINITELY not competent. That obvious racist's mind is gone.
I‚Äôm so glad that it just showed Washington post! There is a live feed with Joe Biden and he has 246 people. That being said do you honestly believe that USA believes your pollsü§°ü§™ü§°ü§°
Trump has done more in 3.5 years than any president ever!  What has Biden done in his 40+ years in Congress?
I‚Äôm confused. Do you and Eric think Joe Biden is an abducted child? Or did you confuse it with a Silver Alert? That would at least make sense. Haha he‚Äôs old. Is there an alert for narcissistic and corrupt millionaires?
Can I wait to answer that until after the 1st non debate? You know Biden will be in his basement with a teleprompter and they will be asking softball questions and then when Trump tries to reply they will say we are taking back their time just like they did with Barr. üôèüèªüá∫üá∏
Barry said TRUMP trying to disenfranchise black voters. Trying to rig election ........ blah blah blah.  What he really means is Everyone vote for Biden so I don‚Äôt go to prison for treason.
Democrats - making your myths come true!  Portland and other riots are a myth üôÑ Mail in voter fraud is a myth üôÑ Obama, Clinton and Biden spying on Trump's campaign is a myth üôÑ
That‚Äôs wishful thinking Kamala! You and Biden need to accept the fact that President Trump will be around for 8 years.
Class act right there high jacked a funeral of an amazing man in order to promote a political lie. Most corrupt president in the history of this country with his side kick Biden GTFOH!
Joe Biden promises unicorns in every yard
My son is in the American military and it‚Äôs not his job to arrest the President of the United States of American. Maybe the feds will arrest Obama and Biden soon however we hope.
Fear and false promises. Be aware. Be ready.  drumpf lies about everything. More lies to come, big lies in last three months about mail in voting, COVID vaccine, Joe Biden. #WeWillBeReady #WeWillVote #AmericaOrTrump #RestInPowerJohnLewis #GoodTrouble
Saw it. You don‚Äôt have the enthusiasm level of Biden when you read from the teleprompter. But I suppose it‚Äôs the only way to prevent you for sabotaging your own campaign.
That wasn't even a eulogy...it was a political speech for bozo Biden.
I came home and, before I got to the front door, I stepped on a gooey mess that smelled awful. I looked down, and it was Devin Nunez.
Ok. And a President would be needed to lead them... Thus tweeting at Biden.   Not to mention you fail to see tweets at powerful people as statements to multiple people as well the actual recipient.
It seems to me, Kimberly, that that decision will be made long before Biden is sworn in
I'm glad Joe Biden has told You What Color You are and how to vote.
I was half-expecting to see Joe Biden pop up from behind the casket and throw BIDEN t-shirts into the crowd.
Who‚Äôs pushing politics now Jane! Obama used a eulogy for a Black civil rights leader to promote Biden who has never done a damn thing for the Black community!
I dont know for sure but say hes impeached and removed tommorrow. I dont think thats an automatic win for biden, either pence or someone else runs in his place. Im not an expert though
Lots of reasons, but the main one is that you can‚Äôt tell me that Biden is going to win over the states that Hillary couldn‚Äôt that would get him to 270.

So Biden could become the second. He speaks Jibberish. That counts right?
Nice opinion piece. Now do real life and post the story about Biden running on the Sanders/AOC socialists platform.

Biden 2020 baby!!
Biden should be replaced if the Democrats have any chance to beat Trump. His Mental health is makes him unfit to be President. #ABC
We all look forward to Joe Biden .. You are just not good for our country the last 4 years tell us that
I dont think Biden is gonna make it. They are waiting to the last minute to pull him out and put someone else in.
No sane person would vote for Biden
Hate to break it to you but.....he didn't have the majority in 2016 and people like Biden better! Where is her going to manufacture these votes? Should we worry about fraud from his side? Is that why he is so worried about it? Unreal 500 million votes cast! Lol
if it only reveals that certain officials engaged in an attempt to weaken the president and drive a bogus investigation forward, it would condemn Democrats who have defended the Mueller investigation, including Joe Biden.
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for Biden and hate speech on Trump
Sounds like Biden‚Äôs got it in the bag then. Nothing to worry about right? I sincerely hope that EVERY citizen gets out there and votes.
That would be a slap in the face to every black person that backed Biden.
PELOSI:  COME TO CHINATOWN!  EAT, DRINK AND SHOP!  IT'S SAFE! BIDEN:  THE PRES IS XENOPHOBIC!  HE WON'T LET THE CHINESE FLY HERE!  Who should pay?
Joe Biden is 77... In the mortality rate of males 75 to 79 is 4,193 per 100,000 (80 to 84 is 6,901)  So there is greater than a 4.1% chance of him dying each year he is in office.  So about an 18% chance that he just dies in office of natural causes.  They just need to be ready.
Fuck Trump and Biden........and what ?!
I'll be sure to let all of these people your targeting g know what your doing. Your fake ppl with no lives that do this. Its freedom to say what you want on here. Wait a sec, its not, twitter is a biden biased company
He lost track of being at a funeral, thought he was at a Rally for him and Joe Biden!!!!
I'm doing the same. My desire to see Trump ousted outweighs my desire to not vote for Biden.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ if they‚Äôre voting for Biden they‚Äôre uninformed about everything and getting educated is a slim chance
Watched some, I don't know about Biden, Pelosi did!
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
We dont want Joe Biden as President. They are both crooks. One has be3n around for 50 yrs and hasnt done shit for the American people. All of a sudden a new guy comes along that knows everything about all the Democrats and now the democrats are squirming!! Obama is Satanic
I believe that in the 2024 election, Harris should be on the ballot.  Not 2020.  Harris dropped out earlier than many because she did not have the support.  Biden needs someone who will bring support (other than Bernie Sanders).
He and his GOP has done so much damage that it will take Biden and his congress and senators at least a year to undo the damage.
Biden, Pelosi and the Democrats could possibly seal victory just by saying "We will repeal the 2006 PAEA and restore stability to the US Postal Service."  Why won't they?
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for lying Biden. Surprised the family let him do this. Shame on them
Not a Biden fan either, my remark was not partisan. Weak candidates on both sides.
What???? Obama was not President in January nor was Biden Vice President. What are you talking about??!
Campaign speech for Lying Biden. Was no funeral.  All a put on
He‚Äôs campaigning for lying Biden. Lol. Disgusting that Lewis‚Äôs family let this go on
Wow, Biden‚Äôs really going to win in November huh....
People who think Biden won‚Äôt use secret police make me laugh because Obama was the one who signed that power to the president   Both sides of the same coin
...Biden is a pedophile. I don‚Äôt support either one, but that shit is disturbing.

You really screwed up endorsing Biden over Bernie. I guess the offer of a cabinet position was too good to pass up. I'd say something about it being on your conscience, but now that you're a stereotype politician, you probably don't have one.

Where the heck is Joe Biden? He's like vanished off the face of the earth.
Which means if President Obama goes in like this during a eulogy, just imagine how his campaign speeches for Joe Biden are going to be this fall.
Vote for who ever you want. Just remember that if you want Trump out of office that a vote for anyone other then Biden is a vote in Trumps favor. The Democratic party can not afford to split our vote. We know the Republican party won't be writing in celebrities.
I can recall 8 years of having a sham president and a con VP in the Obama/Biden circus.
Biden could pick Minnie Mouse, she‚Äôs a black &amp; white woman, less of a cartoon than many others and I would still vote for him.
Yes, Trump *could* lose, and Democrats *could* retake the Senate. But it ain't over till it's over.  Backing Biden right now makes me feel like "Weekend at Bernie's."
I get calls and texts but when I say I‚Äôm not voting for Biden, they disengage.
The only way our freedom will be gone is if Biden gets in the White House!!!
Don‚Äôt forget the corporations who will benefit handily at the expense of...everyone else. They are literally banking on a Biden win. As is China.
Well you‚Äôve had 40 years to study Biden , shouldn‚Äôt be to hard to find something
Don't ask that question homie... you know you only asked that because you feel guilty for getting paid by Biden and the Clinton/Obama administration
Yes, because we libs believe in basic human decency.   Now ask the ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù if they‚Äôd help an elderly person wearing a Joe Biden T-shirt.
It only appears that way because Biden has dropped out without a comment!!!!  Worry about keeping your citizens happy, I hear they're not!!!!   What did you do to them?????
I doubt it, I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe Biden is ahead in a meaningful way that Trump will lose. The methodology of the polls are flawed in such a severe way that you can‚Äôt glean anything from them. This is an axiom every presidential year w/polls that we should‚Äôve learned.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote in favor of Xi Jinping, the CCP, and a vote against the interests of the United States of America. üá∫üá∏#Trump2020

Within this WaPo opinion peice, it reads, ‚ÄúNonetheless, Biden chose to taint the president essentially with a charge of treason.‚Äù Is it still treasonous when Trump himself suggests delaying the election,
Biden watching Trump collapse, but then realizing what he will probably inherit.
So it turns out Biden's accusation wasn't unfounded at all
Removing necessary money will result in Biden and his cronies winning in Nov.  Get the jobs back and then cut the unemployment....i promise i make more than the enhanced umemployment.  Need a place to go back to.  Like 30 million more people.  32.9% decrease GDP.
Yeah, Trump would never do that. Crazy Biden!
Rice would be a great pick for VP. She‚Äôs highly qualified, has worked directly with Biden in the White House and we don‚Äôt lose any sitting Senators or Governors. The Trumpsters will despise anyone selected regardless of who they are so, forget them and move forward.
I support Biden. He‚Äôs not a traitor. Go foam at the mouth somewhere else.
Big relief to me if Joe Biden says, "Kamala Harris" soon.
Possibility 1; Biden is elected with Hillary Clinton as his V.P. and the Speaker of the House, Pelosi pushes the 25th amendment to rid the country of Biden and ...TA DA.. Hillary becomes President.
Remember   and  defend every fraudulent statement  .  What will they say to President Pelosi and or President Biden when she or he takes office?
Donald Trump threatens to DELAY US presidential election in worrying Twitter rant
True! BIDEN HAS NO SHOT!  Will the Libs promise to not loot and riot when Trump wins!?
As of today, this column has officially not aged well.
It's so ironic that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were the actual reasons why president Trump was elected and their failed policies and here they are trying to revive those policies it's just ridiculous. I truly hope American voters don't fall for thier BS and lies
It is clearly unfounded, over the line, and outrageous to suggest such a thing, basically accusing Trump of treason! At least according to one conservative writer.
The sinking feeling in my stomach is that this transformation to fascism in the US is inevitable. Seeing unmarked/unidentifiable men ‚Äújust doing their job‚Äù &amp; a large % of the pop being incredibly racist &amp; brainwashed by extreme right wing propaganda. I dont think Biden is a fix.
Actually we could move it up a month or two everyone knows how it's going to turn out massive massive victory for President Joe Biden and you and your grifter family can return 2 private life where you are going to be tried in the courts.
Here we go again.  Kamala now Rice.
If you're not in love with Biden I get it. This is, however, less about who we put in and more about who we take out of office. We know Republicans won't be writing in Blake Shelton, Mel Gibson, or Ted Cruz. We as Democrats can't afford to split our vote.
Absolutely not, idgaf if you win, Biden wins, or Mickey Mouse wins, get this shit over with
Put on the mask and increase the polling hours.   But i wouldnt care if it was delayed.  I‚Äôm concerned about the economy.  If it takes Biden has a chance.  You sent the market into a free fall with this post.
Jim Jordan was fucking unhinged, per usual. Told Google CEO Pichai that he was "rigging the election for Biden."  Jordan, your narrative is wrong. Move that question to Zuck. Most of AdWords is lifestyle brands. Address the other monitor, dogg.
Yeah but Biden has the cognitive abilities of a goldfish
O yes can you imagine If it was someone with a Biden hat. Omg
O yes. They would love everybody to wear a Biden hat.  This is Cuba , Venezuela. Do wht they say or you‚Äôll pay
Did  Biden have sex with a cousin?  YES / NO
He endorsed Biden ü§î
Put on a mask ....mail in voting means Biden gets elected.  If we can go to the grocery store we can go to the polls.  Extend the hours to encompass the entire 24 hr period.
I challenge you to a zoom call town hall. No teleprompter, no ear piece, just you and me and whomever wants to listen. Stop hidin Biden. You're old and senile and can't face the American public.  It's OK, let's just let  handle it!! #Trump2020Landslide
Now if Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Harris it will appear he succumbed to this ambition nonsense if he does it prove he is an independent thinker
I will never vote for Joe Biden in any election.
I would argue that the reason Trumps messaging on Covid -19 has become more serious lately is NOT because of the Biden polls.  I would argue that he is really just  setting the stage for an election to be too dangerous for the public to actually participate in.
We talking Biden or Trump tho? Unless you're voting Jorgensen I've got bad news for you.
I would like to hear their classification of "violent protesters."  And then laugh,  remembering an umbrella wielding man in Minneapolis was recently arrested for arson.  A white supremacist.  Believed to be purposefully agravating tensions.
If you think we will have a road paved in Gold with Biden and whoever for VP, look at what Obama did for our country! NO THANKS!!!!!!!!
Nadler Tweet Team... rep Nadler, do you actually tweet or mod you have a highly paid team of sycophants to perpetrate and propagate your tweeted pablum? VP Biden &amp; Sen Warren need some originality tips. No sleeping at work btw.

Keep in mind that Joe Biden is one of China's best friends and doesn't consider them a problem at all. If he's elected, their tentacles will reach into even more places in more ways to hurt America.
President Biden and the most powerful military in the history of the world, which he will have just taken command of.

"BIDEN! PELOSI! DNC!"  broken fucking record.  Surprised he didn't accidentally tack "Benghazi!" onto the end of it.
If Biden wins George Soros will be the puppet master.
Honestly these stories are serving to undermine anyone Biden picks if it's -not- Sen Harris. It also calls into question if these Biden "allies" really have his and our best interests in mind.  There are several credible VP options. This war on Kamala in particular is disturbing.
Agreed...if she‚Äôs not selected, these leaks are the type of thing that‚Äôll turn off her supporters and possibly suppress turnout...Biden needs to fix this, and fast.
..but I would give you the same answer if the question was "Do you like Biden?"
A vote for anyone other then Biden will be a vote in favor of Trump. The Democratic party can not afford to split the vote over multiple candidates. We know the Republican party will say united. We need to too.   Also kanye is a Trump supporter and a Republican.
She‚Äôs about to checkout very soon, she‚Äôs just a little bit healthier than Biden. It‚Äôs a race for them to a very warm permanent place.
Only the unread, unlearned, casual voter who remembers Joe Biden in the same way that  the rest of us remember Andy Griffith.
Why has it taken Bumbling Biden this long to make statement that should have been made on 1st week of June? Joe Biden is a Con. His handlers are realizing that the polls are telling him now to speak out.  But, CBS won't ask the tough question as to why not then? CBS=fake news.
Many opportunities missed with today's anti trust hearings. I support you all. I always have &amp; always will. I am just saying. I don't think Big Tech is all that worried. Jack not showing was a big middle finger.  The questions asked, seemed like Biden press conference.
Look at the bright side! The rioting thugs won‚Äôt be voting to Biden in November. Felons can‚Äôt vote!
Kamala Harris will only focus on making sure Joe Biden succeeds in every way.  Wanting Joe and the country to succeed is her ambition.  If that happens, then she should be rewarded with the Presidency.  She will have earned it.
If Tulsi were the pic I'd be absolutely ecstatic to vote for Biden. The party's treatment of her was absolutely disgusting.
You're still going to lose to Biden here in Texas.
Please remember that a vote for anyone else besides Biden will be a vote in favor of Trump. We cannot afford to split the Democratic vote.
Joe Biden is a moderate. YOU on the other hand, are a Nazi loving fascist.
That‚Äôs a whole field of bullshit. From the same idiots that expect us to believe Biden could beat anyone in a nation poll.
The democrats sure don‚Äôt solve anything.  They give away money and provide free crap to everyone.  Everyone is a winning in the Democrat party.  What a joke! Joe Biden is a dult!  Anyone voting for him in November doesn‚Äôt give a crap about this great nation!
This shit isn't working this time around.  They could tell me Joe Biden shot Barr on 5th Avenue twice and I am still voting for him.    Barr says he won‚Äôt wait until post-election to reveal Durham‚Äôs findings. Democrats fear a campaign-altering surprise.
Bro, I‚Äôm gonna checkout for a minute.  Biden gonna fuck this up.  I can feel it.
Important thread on drump admitting he still hasn‚Äôt asked Putin about Putin‚Äôs bounty on our soldiers‚Äô heads.  Frightening. drumpf has no concern, no interest, no remorse.  The line b/w drumpf and Biden could not be clearer.   #FascistInChief
A vote for anyone other then Biden will be a vote in Trumps favor!
Joe biden has the cognitive abilities of a gold fish. He probably doesn't even remember that he's running for President when he wakes up in the morning.

When Joe Biden becomes our next President, you are going to have an epic meltdown.  It will be one heck of a Twitter rant.  #TrumpIsACrybaby
If  Supporters support #JoeBiden &amp; #Biden wins the election. U could get Liberals &amp; a lot of Centrist Democrats 2 support Cannabis Legalization &amp; #MedicareForAll  This All or Nothing mentality will get u Socialist no where &amp; #Trump reelected.
No but Biden/Rice is terrifying
If he Continues ‚Äùlooking‚Äù like he's taking COVID seriously and a few debates when I'm assuming he roast the shit out of Biden. He probably comes out on top.
7pm w/  Polls show Joe Biden lead slipping in key state of Minnesota üìä; 73% of Democratic college students support taking down statues of Founding Fathers who owned slaves: poll. only 4% of Republican college students feel same way. üéß ‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è
As much as Dems like to use this excuse every 4 years, it doesn't work.  Pick the right guy that supports the right policies and you'll see the left flock together. Picking Biden was specifically picking outside the left demographic.  Go bark up the right's tree.
Biden is really going to win by doing nothing üò∂
A vote for anyone other then Biden will be a vote in Trumps favor.
She lost to Biden for gods sake lol
With all due respect to Joe Biden, this country is well past the point where unity is possible. Jesus, Buddha, and Gandhi together couldn‚Äôt do that.   The best we can hope for is to avoid another Civil War.
I hate to say it... But I honestly think that Biden is going to take this one.
Texas is Biden Country!  #TrumpKillsTexas
I don't think Biden does - at least not 100%; if he did, I believe he would tell us. He's not a drama queen, &amp; I don't think he'd hide such a decision just to build anticipation. He has a plan in place &amp; he won't veer from it 1 inch; &amp; he'll communicate w/ everyone involved.
Check this out from Right-center biased Forbes:   You're losing. But congrats, you're #1 in converting Republican voters to Democrat voters over any other president in history! #TrumpFailedAmerica  #RepublicansVotingBlue2020  #NoOneLikesYou
doesn't know about Texas or Texans. We are not pro Biden.
Luckily it wasn't a Democrat like Biden who would have never cut off travel to China.
Biden finna get in office and be like, ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt me and Obama already fix this shit after Bush. smfh.‚Äù
Imagine doing this instead of phone banking for Biden
President Trump should challenge Biden to five 2-hour long debates, standing, with independent moderators.
Biden doesn't know who he is either!!! Goes to show parents are wise when they say choose your friend carefully!  He got Obama &amp; Hillary!!!
Trump in Texas: President raises millions and defends oil &amp; gas in Permian Basin visit, vowing, "As long as I‚Äôm your president we will never let anyone put American energy out of business." #TrumpTexas #energy #oil #gas #PermianBasin #txbiz
Ooooh hell nawwwwwww, we‚Äôre stuck with pelosi, Schumer, Nadler, Biden, Schiff, etc etc etc your stuck with this yahoo lol. But we won‚Äôt blame you if you don‚Äôt blame us, deal? lol
Hopefully NATO would send the balance of troops until Biden comes in next January.
She got smoke messages from politico that Camileon an is going to be Bidens VP!!! Jumping in the current attention getter (Barr) hoping Biden notices her undying devotion, deflects attention from Camileon!!!

Making the democrats, Obama, and Biden out to be upholders of justice is weird.
Take your own advice because clearly you haven't researched if you think Biden is worse.
Ut oh, Biden is in trouble. He used compete sentences with multisyllable words. Trump will ask for a translator.
#Environmental groups "delighted by" #Biden‚Äôs recent announcement of pledges for #cleanenergy by 2035, to spend $2tn for interlinked #climate #jobs plan within four years. ‚ÄúThe climate plan is a jobs plan. Our jobs plan is, in part, a climate plan.‚Äù
Great news! I heard on my local news last evening, that Biden is now leading tRump in my state, Texas! It‚Äôs a small lead, 1-2 points, but it will grow!! Go Texas, throw the bums out!
#FascistCruz is again sharing Trump‚Äôs lime of crap.    #Biden2020
Go home, we don't want you here! Congrats you are probably going to turn Texas blue. I was Repub but voting for Biden.
Ok, so about three weeks ago, I noticed my neighbors added a Trump sign very close to their house. Then... I noticed their next door neighbors put up a Biden sign. And NOW today the original Trump neighbors have added an anti-socialism sign.   I love it. Keep it going.
Joe Biden says he will name running mate in first week of August
Not a chance in heck the POTUS A Biden will be on the same stage at the same time in public. Expect a virtual debate stage that will be plagued with technical difficulties anytime POTUS speaks,responds or Biden messes with his ear piece because he didnt hear the answer fed to him
Her despratate attempt to sway Biden from rumors she's heard about Camilian being his VP pick!!!!  Take it out on Barr, top story! Will get attention!
This dude is so stupid. Does he even have a job? I don‚Äôt he became a star or whatever he is . People that are not voting for Biden did not vote for Hillary. Screw them.
Biden at his best.
"Such voters are not a group of people Democrats instinctively know how to talk to. They are people Never Trump Republicans know how to talk to. So the more Biden‚Äôs and congressional Democrats‚Äô leads grow,
"Biden is now running far ahead in the major swing states, and running competitively in solidly Republican states like Georgia and Texas, because a whole lot of people who are traditional Republican voters are thinking about abandoning their party‚Äôs nominee.
"It is possible for Biden to beat Trump without attracting many conservative votes. But it is not possible for him to win in a giant landslide without winning moderate conservative votes.
He is right tho siraj. Listen to  break down Biden and Democrat plans
Go ahead tell me this is not a Democrat BAIT &amp; SWITCH!  Who will they send in Biden‚Äôs place?????
1 way out of chaos: #Biden #ElectoralCollege #victory so overwhelming T‚Äôs #victim claims will be unbelievable. Required: Relentless #grassroots efforts in #swing #states and unremitting focused #outrage on Trump and his party‚Äôs efforts to defeat democracy.
Reasonable people read right through her dishonest, disgusting behavior. The problem is that more than half of Americans are not reasonable = President Biden.
Trying to Appease Muslims, Biden Inadvertently  Calls for Jihad
Don‚Äôt ever put the US FLAG next to a Biden banner!  That is disturbing!
Trump arrives in West Texas to tout energy policy, scoop up cash, and try to tamp down the Biden surge
Once again, the total hypocrisy. How do you know Biden wants to be best mates with China? You partied with them? Or you read some psycho conspiracy article from crazy ass O.A.N. or maniacal Brietbart?
Biden being used as a pull toy!
Can you imagine being silly enough to put your reputation behind a pedophile crook like Biden!
Wake up!  Biden has lost his mind and has some serious health issues.  People are sick how they are using him
I‚Äôve always thought he would not debate Biden.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a big Biden guy. Not at all, actually. But it‚Äôs time for a change. Trump has divided the country. It‚Äôs time to give someone else a chance.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs Biggest Problem Isn‚Äôt Wealthy Suburbanites. It‚Äôs the White Working Class. - POLITICO
Hey I think he could do a better job there. I‚Äôm voting for policy more than the human. Biden will be a disaster for policy.
Biden‚Äôs Campaign
This is exactly what they want you to think. ‚ÄúWell it couldn‚Äôt be worse under Biden‚Äù. But they are the ones letting it be worse now. Trump isn‚Äôt encouraging violent protests. Never has.
So are you voting Biden or helping Republicans by not voting?
You love what you see in Portland as well? The do nothing Democrat‚Äôs support that. Vote Biden and that will be your city next year.
Enjoy? Enjoy what? A racist administration that shamed the poor for being poor and makes poverty even harder for them? I‚Äôll enjoy my life much more on January 20, 2021 when President Biden takes office.
Will Kamala Harris be Biden's VP pick? I was offended by the way she treated Joe in the debate but nevertheless believed that in some ways, she would be very strong. But I also like Val Demings and Karen Bass. Biden's VP Odds.
That is a very bad and uneducated decision. You need to look at accomplishments and not what the fake news media reports on. Biden will actually crumble this country. Want to see the dollar crumble with it.. vote Biden.
Expanding the Supreme Court should be on the agenda of a Pres. Biden administration

In a pandemic - I heard one woman interviewed on Election Day for primaries and she said even though they knew Biden was in already, they stood in line- for HOURS to let trump know ‚Äúwe are coming‚Äù. This continues to bring me hope - especially when I feel so down.
So excited for Joe Biden to make America imperialist again!
Biden himself is terrible candidate. Dems deep throat the idea of "establishment" and need a woke young tech-y person, TBH. Yang would have gotten drilled by Trump, but more interesting race, would have exposed some core issues we need out there. This is just gonna be mud-sling
Biden is simply old... you just do things a bit   s l o w e r  that's all... He's still sharp, will put qualified people in place, is a good man, and will do the right thing. BEST argument for Biden? WE have no choice. Period.
I can't believe  Supporters have no problem helping  win the election by not supporting   Ur OK with #MoscowMitchMcConnell cutting #Medicare because #Biden doesn't support #Medicare4All #VoteBlueNoMatterWho

Biden/Harris will get trounced...Biden/anyone will get trounced...it‚Äôs coming and you all will lose you‚Äôre collective minds...again!!
Trump Surrenders Lead In Texas Yet National Support Remains Constant, Latest Morning Consult Polls Show  via  Hey DC, why do give credence to these Dementiacrat supression polls.  You should know BS when you see it.
Biden will fix it.
Why? What about the Ellis Island award for advancement of inner city minority children? He was hailed as a black culture hero until he ran for president. So why the change? What do you think of Biden's history of racial division? "Poor kids are just as smart are white kids."
The irony on both Leftist liberals and the Far Right is Biden is also pro-police and won‚Äôt let thugs and gangs destroy public property for any cause. Actually no President ever will!!!
Contemplating buying (a home) in the next six months or so. Can someone with actual context tell me what you think is going to happen to interest rates? I've heard fall for a bit, but a big "right side" talking point is that Biden would mean 13-14% rates. Takes?
We'll add that to the list, just  below a Joe Biden election, a national health panic and rebuilding the economy.
Biden doesn‚Äôt have a brain and he doesn‚Äôt remember what he is even doing....  what a joke the left has become
We weren‚Äôt prepared for the absolutely unprecedented chaos, turmoil and MASS DEATH that His Bigliness brought us! Biden can only be an IMPROVEMENT!
Why does Biden look like Ashley Schaeffer?  Well if they ever make a movie about 2020....
Hey DUI Matt.  Biden doesn‚Äôt want to defund the police.  He wants reform.  Stop spreading lies to scare the uneducated
This is how invested they are in keeping the virus going. In holding the country hostage to Covid 19.   They are hoping to destroy the economy with the fear of it. Any reasonable voice, especially  a woman of color, they will attempt to destroy. All this to have Joe Biden win. ü§™
I predict somehow Biden will not debate trump. Something will happen. Idk what, but I just can‚Äôt see Biden on a stage with trump!
Sorry if they think I‚Äôm not acting like a rabid hyena like the trumpees! I would agree that Biden‚Äôs supporters are more sedate, but also more thoughtful and resolved!  There‚Äôs no need to get all hyped up when you know what you‚Äôre doing. We‚Äôre just biding our time until Nov.3rd!
That‚Äôs why Biden will go another route.
I wouldn‚Äôt vote for neither one of them mf‚Äôs especially not Biden weird ahh honestly ion think we‚Äôll even have an election..
Biden will be in the Oval Office - everyone knows it.  Even Trump - that's why he is working so hard to destroy our country before he goes...
Right... ‚Äúpraying‚Äù. She‚Äôs a bit old for Biden‚Äôs tastes I would think.... By a few decades at least.
Systemic racism. Wah wah wah. Thousands of blacks making millions. Ok. So tell me about systemic racism  lying Biden didn‚Äôt want black kids going to school with white kids. Get it , who‚Äôs racist üí©üí©üí©üí©
To win, Biden just needs for Trump to give ‚Äòpress conferences‚Äô Everything Trump touches dies
This would by funny if Biden wasn‚Äôt the nominee
Evidently white women is a no go for Joe Biden!! His racist ass needs those black votes!! Remember!! Yoy ain't black unless you vote for Joe Biden!! Well!! I ain't black!!
Jer 15:21  "And I will deliver you out of the hands of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the palms of the terrible and ruthless tyrants." Lord keep us out of the hands of Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.
Yeah, cuz their white! He needs his black voters which is pathetic because ppl are gonna vote for whoever they want. They don't need ppl telling them they ain't black if they don't vote for Joe biden, but why would a racist say that I wonder? Oh, for votes!!
Biden/Harris is the ticket, she is proven and battle ready!
No, this is the DEMOCRATS playing games. They are desperate!! Notice how no one is talking  any kinds of shit about Biden?? 40 yrs in office and never done shit!! Lmao
Biden is a puppet and the left will happily give away this country if given a chance.  Liberal left wing lunatic democrats need to all be voted out of office
Got room for one more? That‚Äôs how far away I want to be from Joe Biden...... in all seriousness good luck and Godspeed!!
Today's train wreck is another vote for a dude like Cuban. Trump doesn't understand tech beyond division = engagement, tweets. Biden probably thinks Facebook is a thing the kids do to make crazy videos.   We need someone in there who gets this shit.
Biden‚Äôs a joke!! So are the liberals.
Yeah... I think Biden would be doing this:
Trump policies are helping Texas economy recover, while Biden would crush energy jobs
Or maybe like he was allowed to answer questions by republicans and he knows what he is talking about.  The left has lost their mind and Biden doesn‚Äôt have the üèÄ ‚öΩÔ∏è to debate trump.  Basement dweller  is a puppet
Remember. Joe Biden = 'Regressive'.
She wants to be VP so she can line her pockets with cash , but sure she‚Äôll have lying Biden commited an then she‚Äôll take over
Islamic Organizations have signed onto support  I didn't understand how they could do that when he is Pro Abortion, and supports killing live Fetuses so planned parenthood call sell organs. Obama/Biden supported all these endless US wars in the middle east.
Jokes on all of you. Trump and Biden both work for the same people. Kabuki Theatre.
Think lying Biden is a grifter , he sure pocketed a lot of our tax payer money almost 50 years in politics , don‚Äôt think your a true Texan.  Texas will never be blue  move along
Lying Biden had almost 50 years to fix things. Guess he lined his pockets to much with cash an you would lock up more blacks like you‚Äôve done in the past
If some questions on a cognitive test were difficult for him, just imagine him trying to process math in a poll. He probably got so confused he thought HE was Biden.
Mmmmh! Can we render the same argument for Biden? No?
NYTimes: Oil and Gas Groups See ‚ÄòSome Common Ground‚Äô in Biden Energy Plan Oil and Gas Groups See ‚ÄòSome Common Ground‚Äô in Biden Energy Plan
Here‚Äôs a thought that is scary.... if joe Biden is elected it will be 16 years of Whoever is Vice President on the ticket-Biden will never actually govern so the VP will have a 16 year run- two PRESIDENCIES!!! HOW SCARY IS THAT? THE COUNTRY WILL BE GONE FOREVER! WHAT DO YOU THINK

Well, it‚Äôs winning my vote. For Joe Biden! BLUE TSUNAMI in November!
But to answer yours, we need to ditch this Biden bullshit and start getting people to actively realize that hoping for an election to stop an authoritarian in power is the stupidest thing imaginable
Vote for Biden or prepare for the armed insurrection isn't the rallying cry people think
If you want your future destroyed just elect Biden!  He has radical plans that will ruin this country!
Warren is Hermione and Biden is Ron. üò≠ Smart girls everywhere know this feeling.
A WHOLE federal government to coordinate. Tell me how's that Stimulus working out for ya? Eviction relief? Healthcare? Unemployment?   We can listen to scientists and do exactly what they say, and close every business down and become socialists overnight. Biden ain't going to
So he's going to force the governors, mayors, store owners, and citizens to wear masks?  Give us healthcare? How is listening to scientists going to fix a pandemic that'll be a year old by time Biden has any authority?
Biden has my vote and my whole family‚Äôs vote. Please save this country from disaster. Thank you!!
Biden can heal this country. But Biden is also pro-police, America. So if you think he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúgreen light‚Äù pulling out all police so violent youth gangs can continue destroying federal property you‚Äôre in for a surprise.  Stop the violence!
Joe Biden either stands with the people being brutalized on the street, or he stands with the feds/police doing the brutalizing. There's no central position that isn't political bullshit
Will Biden send the DHS in to arrest people who don't wear masks? Is that how he'll handle things better?
Just think how great it will be when Biden wins and this will no longer be limited to states run by leftist Democrats.  What a future it will be!  Idiots
Remember this when you vote!!! Are you ready for Kamala Harris, JUNIOR Senator, failed Democratic Presidential contender  unable to raise funds for her own campaign or obtain &gt;3% of the Dem vote, become Vice President, THEN President  when Biden dimentia progresses? #TRUMP2020
Still blaming Obama for bad testing supplies left by his administration for a virus that was never even heard of until this year.  Seriously just stop already. Obama Biden Democrats have nothing to do with Trump not doing a damn thing to lead this country when we needed it
Heels up Harris said as much! They would come for us when Biden gets elected. They would come after all the people that supported Trump. üñïüñïI say they should have already done that because there will be no Biden presidency. Trump LANDSLIDE 2020 they will be prosecuted!üôèüèªüá∫üá∏
So Biden out here showing his little notepad with Kamala‚Äôs name on it.  He‚Äôs teasing.
IF YOU VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN YOU AGREE TO LAWLESS STREETS, BURNING OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE. ENJOY.
Biden should have said ‚ÄùI‚Äôm going to select the best person‚Äù.  By saying he will select a female and person of color, people will say the VP was selected because they were a black female.  This is a disservice to the many talented minority females in this country.
I hope your wrong because if Biden wins we‚Äôre doomed
Aren't the dems busy trying to burn federal court houses? Good luck getting Biden the electoral college lmao.
Biden is way up in the polls and there is no way Trump can catch up. Why should he waste his time worrying about mail in ballots?
Trump Iconic Biden Ironic
Here‚Äôs my thought of the day.... Joe Biden is a complete moron!!!
Absolutely NOT! Riden with Biden
What an idiot .. what about Biden ( Pelosi‚Äôs puppet on a string ) let‚Äôs make the rest of our Beautiful Land a shot hole like Portland and LA among the many other areas !! Socialism.. I vote NOüá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏è
How can Joe Biden pass "the biggest economy recovery plan" when he has no freakin idea how to get an economy to recover, or else he would have helped Obama do it. But we had NO HOPE of recovering then.
Biden will be President next year, and he'll have a personal Attorney General, and everything Barr has done for Trump will be the precedent. I hope you're prepared.
Alternatively, the vaccine will be done at the end of January and President Biden will claim he produced a vaccine within days of taking charge

No, this will allow China to be the world dominant by 2030 if Biden wins!

I wouldn‚Äôt call Biden a ‚Äúchump‚Äù show some respect for a man running for officeüëçü§£. MAGA 4 MORE!!
The kids are too fucking stupid these days. They will just keep using it. They don't care. They just want to watch each other eat tide pods!! Pretty much sums up Biden fans too
I get why Biden voters act so weird now!! Their not from America! It makes sense
Their both crooked as hell!! Ones been there 3.5 yrs, the other one has been there for 40 plus years!! Now, common sense tells you one thing!! Dude has not done shit!! In 40 yrs. I dont care what Trump has done. Save our country!! Dont give it to the Chinese like biden wants!
So the woman Tulsi destroyed is gonna be Biden‚Äôs running mate üòï
People constantly joke about Biden not knowing where he is.  Biden campaign finally trots him out on TV to show he's present, in the moment, and sharp.  And the first effing words out of the man's mouth are:
I hear you but it‚Äôs not that simple. I‚Äôm not willing to burn it all down. I understand that it may be effective but the consequences would be catastrophic. I‚Äôd rather we fight Biden than Trump. The main problem is complacency. When Obama won in 2008 I mostly checked out.
That's what I'm hoping for. Not a big fan of Harris who seems to be the favorite. I figure between Biden and Warren's experience in the Senate they can connect the two parts of the party.
And who‚Äôs on the unmasking list - Joe Biden  BOOM
That‚Äôs sounds awfully melodramatic, my friend. Biden is a very centrist Democrat so it‚Äôs not going to be that bad.
Wait.  Did Biden just say he would do exactly what Trump is doing?
Sadly change comes slowly and with awareness and then crisis. Hopefully the pandemic shifts this further after Biden‚Äôs elected via the public option. If we get that we are on our way.....
No proof. Stop lying. #Trump will win 2020. I bet #Biden will say No Debates. Use the COVID-19 Virus as an excuse. #LibsKnowTheyCannotBeatTrump

Rep. Bass: Hoping U.S. can hang on until Biden wins presidency
Biden keeps saying they are gonna pass a bill that will cost, wait for it,$32 TRILLION DOLLARS!
So it's been a month since  took pre-planned questions from pre-approved "reporters".  Lots has happened since then. What hard hitting question do they lob at Biden?  "Why are you speaking in Deleware?"
Biden‚Äôs got a mic in his ear , someone telling him what to say
Biden is an idiot, so no one cares!
Biden just said Arsonist, people who carry guns, &amp; people who break the law should be held accountable. He goes on to explain he would "use local police"....  Really? You mean like the  WHO HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO STAND DOWN!?
Just saw a Trump 2020 ad that showed footage of fires and looting with the tag line, "You won't be safe in Biden's America".  LOL!!!  Yeah, that's actually footage of TRUMP'S America!  That's on YOUR watch, big dawg. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
Biden is an Idiot!
Oh and don‚Äôt forget the Virus is Trumps fault too. Bet Biden fixes that ASAP !  You do make me laugh. For that I truly thank you.
That is just not true   But I tell you what.  I bet after Biden is elected they will be in wonderful shape !  Good times ahead for the Blacks and the Mexican populations !  Go Biden !  Go Liberals !
It‚Äôs weird how they do not censor Trumps opponent.  Like the video where Biden said if you don‚Äôt vote for him you weren‚Äôt black, when it is a scientifically proven fact that voting for Trump does not in fact change your skin tone.
Under a Biden Presidency, families would spend no more than 7% of their income on child-care.  That could be such a relief to so many parents.  #VoteBidenToSaveAmerica  #GoJoe2020
There's nothing that can be said against Joe Biden that cluster Trump hasn't done worse or said worse. that's why even a Joe Biden to no one's really excited about is going to have a blowout Victory against Trump
So after having to see Nadler‚Äôs lying, rude, thuggish left wing hacks being horrible to AG Barr, we have to see Biden‚Äôs economic plan. Here it is...Hide he and his family‚Äôs millions they got from other countries when he was VP!
Who is trying to abuse an elderly person named Joe Biden. With no evidence.
Biden giving a speech during Barr's hearing is classic Biden campaign strategy. #HidinBiden
One word describes Biden.....Idiot!
Show me one with Biden?
My sweet Daddy would call Biden "A Chickenshit".
You need to add Biden to your daily statement!!!
It's actually odd because Trump was for M4A but then you saw how corporate republicans (Koch brothers people) brain washed him. That's why Trump voters in the mid West are going to vote for Biden because he changed absolutely nothing.
No, but if he is president he will go along with all of this. He will expand abortion rights mark my word. Anyone who is remotely pro-life should not entertain the thought of voting for Biden.
Please tiny baby Jesus can Biden just come out to speak so we can cut it him instead of listening to Barr lie and Republicans yammer on about bullshit. #BarrHearing
Don't believe Joe Biden.
Who thinks the Democrats are using this hearing for a campaign? Because they don‚Äôt want Joe Biden saying anything!!!
Biden‚Äôs plan is essentially to rebuild the ACA.
So just because people don‚Äôt like Biden because he is fully on board for late term abortions makes them fans of Putin? Your comparisons are what is wrong with politics in 2020. You demonize Trump voters as evil by putting words in their mouth.
Yet again, Biden is much better than the green party candidate this time around. How am I going to vote for a guy who supports internet censorship.
"Whatever the endgame may be, there is only one way out of the looming electrical chaos: for Biden to win an Electoral College victory so overwhelming that Trump‚Äôs claims of victimhood will be literally unbelievable." Trump vs. Democracy - The Bulwark

I'm with you on the first part of the statement, but I won't celebrate Biden being president.
Black and Hispanic unemployment rates hit their lowest in recorded time because of Trump.  Biden will increase Welfare and jobs will be lost.  Really too bad. Why don‚Äôt you leave the economy issues to someone who has a clue.  You stick to being Mad and uninformed !
Deficit ?  Let me help me.  George W Bush ran up the highest Deficit in recorded time.  Then Obama doubled it.  Trump comes along and if we are lucky he will only double it again   Hopefully.  Now bring in the dunce Biden. OMG.  This will be the final straw    But don‚Äôt worry !
Probably the first truth the orange idiot has told. Life was better for all of us with Obama as it will be with Biden.
Calm down, please Just because a person doesn‚Äôt agree 100% doesn‚Äôt mean they are dumb or need to leave

If BIDEN gets elected, Covid will disappear within a month. She got the names mixed up. Covid has only stuck around this long because Trump is in office.
Biden isn't Obama.   Besides that, Obama was not a good president.
No they didn‚Äôt vote against health care for children. They voted against M4A which is not the only single payer health plan. Joe Biden won the nomination so I should come as no surprise that his plan will be adopted.
DM Hey Jake ... Hope you &amp; Jerusha are well. I certainly understand this tweet &amp; I understand your being unwilling to ‚Äúapologize‚Äù for re-tweeting it for all to see.   It does present us with a dilemma: Who do we vote for in November? Are you more comfortable voting for Biden?

Delivered nothing ?  Well let‚Äôs see.  Trade Agreements that needed fixed 30 years ago. Highest employment rate of all time.  Best economy, lowest taxes, lowest interest rates highest Stock Market. Black and Mexican Unemployment lowest ever ! Can‚Äôt wait for Joe Biden
Lmao "Joe Biden is the most progressive candidate since FDR"
Proud of all 3 of them. They‚Äôre all team players and patriots. I can‚Äôt wait for Jill Biden to be flotus. #GoJoe2020
Trump has been in office for 3 years it‚Äôs going to take to unscrew 50 years of mismanagement. why didn‚Äôt Biden do that as VP in his 8 years? Potus doesn‚Äôt have authority to change state prisons. But u shld note those states have been dim 4 50 years!
Really don‚Äôt want to but I think I do have to vote for Biden. If any other republican were the incumbent I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it but t**** is the fucking WORST
But will Joe Biden be able to bring Corn Pop with him?
This Democrat is voting Red!!! Blood red too!! I mean Red cuz if your voting for Biden, you voting to become like China! Facts. Dems never did anything but legalize weed. Bout it!! Oh and Gay b.s
a 2/3 cut in federal money doesn‚Äôt get Biden elected.  It puts the economy in a free fall, which absolutely gives Biden a better chance. I would agree if the jobless numbers were dropping.  The GOP looks like heartless and greedy to the public taking that stance.
I've notice. Biden Voters are fucking weird. I almost wonder how many real accts there actually are
White leftists will be angry that they aren't centered in this plan.    Biden announces plans to boost black and Latino finances By Sean Sullivan
Nope. You priorities are out of wack. Voters need a good reason policy-wise in order to vote Trump out. Biden hiding and jumping out of his hole every now and then to yell "I'm not Trump, and #M4A sucks, lol!" is not enough.  Policy first, the desired effect comes later with it.
Its bittersweet that Biden hopefully wins in a landslide. For the future of this republic Biden must win &amp; he must win big. But at this point the moldy cheese in my fridge could beat Trump. Regardless the narrative will be that centrist moderation is what beats Trump. Bittersweet
But not a thought of the 40 MILLION families who lost jobs or arent permitted 2 work Death is sad However, politicians job is 2 effect the MAJORITY Stop lying about a virus less deadly than the flu &amp; lets Americans regain economy &amp; happiness Biden completely full of shit!!!
It's interestingly a major far-right talking point ... and I see real estate guys text me all the time now ("leads") saying rates will quadruple like the second Biden goes 1 Electoral College vote ahead, so to see the messaging is interesting.
I actually worked with Ashley Biden for two summers in DC. She's a cool person. Would I say she's a "hard worker?" Not really, but I'm not always either.
If you mean treatment of women, I think Biden is better... but not by a lot.
People who hate people because of the color of the skin are ignorant !  But the BLM movement is starting to change this.  Poor Black people !  Don‚Äôt fret. Joe Biden will fix everything !  What a joke
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like saying to somebody, ‚ÄòYou have a bowl of shit in front of you, and all you‚Äôve got to do is eat half of it instead of the whole thing,' Turner said of voting for Biden in the 2020 presidential election. 'It‚Äôs still sh*t.'‚Äù
Contemplating buying (a home) in the next six months or so. Can someone with actual context tell me what you think is going to happen to interest rates? I've heard fall for a bit, but a big "right side" talking point is that Biden would mean 13-14% rates. Takes?
Biden and Trump are MUCH more similar than people are willing to admit, good and bad.
Disgraceful
Trump, Biden will head to Cleveland Clinic for first presidential debate in September
Dems and Biden will have to come to the middle if they have any chance to beat Trump. With this radical far left platform they will lose almost all of the Independent vote. I still don't think Biden will come close if he loses as much of the Black vote as some predict.
Does Joe Biden have his own Bengazi scandal?  via
2016 DNC Platform.   "Nothing will Fundamentally change." Joe Biden
Haha how about a debate with  President Trump.  Trump would chew Biden  up and spit him out.
I‚Äôm sure he does, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking anything for granted.  Shit Obama‚Äôs vetting team laid out the blueprints for the Biden campaign on everything coming up for them.
Unfortunately #Misogyny is alive and well in America.   The Real Reason Biden Is Ahead of Trump? He‚Äôs a Man
Why did you not attend the funeral Memorial for the late Senator John Lewis Mike Pence was there so was Joe Biden do you not know how this makes you look the world is watching mr. President
Former Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner compares voting for Biden to eating 'bowl of sh--'
I don't think either candidates leads us anywhere better. Not having Trump in office just means less daily headlines and more sneaking shit without us knowing.  Remember, Biden is running on the status quo, on going back to what gave us Trump. That's literally going backwards.
And still BIDEN doesn‚Äôt have a running mate  for VP ?!? Maybe he‚Äôs forgotten hE‚Äôs suppose to have a VP! Indicates the Dems have something up their sleeves .... NO?!!
Joe Biden campaign
First of all its not your business! He can vote for whoever he wants! Biden is the racist and Trump is saving America so the choice is simple
Biden literally has supported segregation (Delaware still has highest pvt school ratio than any other state) reps voted for the 94 crime bill? Please 46 rep vs 188 dims... yes, hardly close. Nothing Nixon, Reagan or bush touched the 94CB, or dim policy of stop &amp;  frisk
Last thing. Trump is not Hitler. Biden is not Hitler. Stop comparing them to one of the worst dictators of the last century.   The truth is Both parties want more Government. Both parties have created the environment we live in today  Vote for less government. You have a choice.
If I'm not mistaken, Trump used to be pro-choice until he met someone who'd survived an abortion. I'm for gun control in background check, waiting period. Biden's Beto would take legally purchased guns away. Chicago w/tough gun control laws has people shooting up the streets
Racism is uncomfortable.  Biden needs to own his shit.
I don‚Äôt know who looks at Biden and thinks ‚ÄúSocialist Revolutionary‚Äù, but I‚Äôll take a moderate guy who can be pulled left on healthcare and Economic policy. I mean, I‚Äôm really just happy not to have a climate denier who deploys unaccountable stormtroopers at this point.
Dear Mr. President, I'm a loyal fan of yours. The polls show you are behind creepy Joe Biden in Texas in the polls. Do you have a plan for Texas and other states? Please stay off Twitter until you have a plan you can discuss.

To say there is nothing fundamentally different from #Trump &amp; #Biden makes u a Socialist for   Yes  gets $$ from Big Corporations &amp; Billionaires but the  wants to cut SS/MEDICARE not the  Are u working for Trump's Campaign????
I give to Biden on a weekly basis and give to a different Dem candidate each week (Phil Ehr (challenging Gaetz) last week; Amy McGrath is this week's donation). Voting is a given. (Only friend is my husband, so that's also a given). üòÄ
Biden was institutional in outing Clarence Thomas on the supreme court. This argument makes no sense
All the more reason to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho &amp; support  and keep the fight for #MedicareForAll on going. If  &amp; the  wins because  Supporters didn't vote for #Biden #Medicare will be cut.
Biden is an old product of 70‚Äôs politics. If you‚Äôre delusional enough to believe in any meaningful, good for the average American citizen change, waste your vote &amp; prepare for frustration.
*pour üôÉ perhaps I had a few to many green beans this eveningüòÅ
So, this is how they get Biden out of the debates. Paying off the universities (or threatening them).

If you force rank November in terms of smarts... 1.  Spike 2.  Jo 3.  Pence 4.  VP to be named later. 5a.  Trump 5b.  Biden
Amen to that..   If Biden wins, nothing good will come of it.   I have never believed in a President more than yourself President Trump.   I truly believe you have We, the people's, best interest at heart.  #MAGA #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver #Trump2020LandslideVictory
Soooo, the Biden/Bass video is a thing.  Ok.
You could replace with Joe Biden for same effect.
Trump retweeting Russian trolls. How typical. Can't wait til November. Biden will work to help Americans rather than tweet Putin propaganda.
I do too, if I thought Bernie would be able to beat Trump I would‚Äôve voted for him because he proposes the quickest path to universal coverage. But I know that he would‚Äôve been destroyed by Trump so I voted for Biden who serves as a more round about way towards universal coverage
Biden will soon be President. The only question is can he tame the radical Left and radical Right that‚Äôs co-opted the narrative from the few sane adults left standing in America?
NO! NO! NO! I want Trump alive! He is the greatest advertisement for voting for Biden &amp; the Democrats. Besides I want the pleasure of watching Trump being dragged out of the White House.  üòÅ
I‚Äôm frustrated with trump right now on some fronts personally. I‚Äôm not a trump cultist. Although I‚Äôll gladly vote for him over hidin Biden
Biden ain‚Äôt no better
Why Harris of course but all of the ones being considered are phenomenal choices and all would make excellent VP‚Äôs however  will compliment President Biden better and then make a great president in 2024.
Riden with Biden, Fort Worth, Texas
Noone said they didn‚Äôt have the right! Have they been arrested? Jailed? Tortured? Executed? No! They have the right to kneel, others have the right to be disgusted and sickened by it. And considering who‚Äôs supporting it, a slave company, Nike and Biden is telling for most!
I think Mrs. Krassenstein should be Biden‚Äôs running mate! Who is with me?

I DONT CARE WHAT TRUMP HAS DONE!! BIDEN IS TOAST
Hey Joe Biden.What' about the Lobbyist that bought tropical land from Biden‚Äôs brother?
He could wind up on Biden's short list for HHS Secretary
Did you expect them to approve it when the candidate who supported it lost to the one who didn‚Äôt? Like I get being annoyed but why would you be surprised, more Democrats support Biden than Bernie so obviously the party wouldn‚Äôt put M4A on the platform.
It‚Äôs funny when people on the right talk about how old Biden is when Trump is only 3 years younger.  #TrumpGriftsYouDie
If Biden wins the Democratic Party will be gone in five years? That‚Äôs a bold prediction!
How does a president not pay homage to a civil rights icon?  #JohnLewis
Biden is worse
What's hard to understand? He's a senile old man who touches women inappropriately. I don't want him for president, either. Ok not voting *for* Biden, I'm voting *against* trump. I am voting for the person with the best chance of beating him, no matter who endorses him.
Joe Biden is playing a dangerous game of bait against Russia which has no basis in fact and which could lead to a precipitous fracture of US-Russian relations.   He speaks of "cyber responses" and "a series of other actions"
Johnson/Weld would be doing the same thing as Jorgenson/Cohen, probably with more press coverage from Bill praising Biden.
What else did  and  do when they met earlier this month to film the conversation everyone watched last week?  Check it out:

BIDEN IS TOAST!! #TRUMP2020LANDSLIDE
Imagine an in studio debate like Biden v Sanders, but it‚Äôs Biden v Trump.  Trump would be destroyed.  No audience to laugh or cheer... just the empty space that is Trump‚Äôs intellect.
Well nothing happened when Biden kept flashing the female secret service agents! Of coarse I imagine they have PTSD at a minimum!
All Biden needs to win the EC is to get half the Gary Johnson and Stein voters in the swing states.  He doesn't actually need to convert Trump voters.  He just needs enough of the Hillary haters who voted 3rd party or write in to jump on board.
Well just create diversity and well get all of the #BLMTerrorists and #lgtbqterroists to vote for Joe!! That aught to get biden in the White house even though he's been there for 40 yrs and hasn't done a thing üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉü§£ü§£ü§£

Yes and I was a republican until 2016 now an activist we flipped my county blue Tarrant in 2018. Alot of republicans will lose their seat moderate republicans and independents are voting for Biden we are sick of the drama
Red Herring  Only one is President and only one owns 100% of the outcome....  It ain't Biden
Texas early voting starts October 13 and goes 3 weeks .Democrats  get out there and vote. Biden needs us to show up. Let's  start some "Good Trouble".
...and so it begins. Democrats will latch on to ANY excuse to cancel Presidential debates because they know senile Joe Biden will be crucified by Trump.
I‚Äôm thinking you want to get with Jill Biden and see what they like so that it doesn‚Äôt have to be renovated again in January
The Trump campaign has done an outstanding job of lowering expectations for  in the debates.    Biden is going to destroy Trump.    It‚Äôs not even going to be close.

Sorry Elon but how would you know? You could not possibly fathom what is going on in the middle class right now. If there is any candidate that is "close" to the middle it's Biden.
Thank you for the list!

Biden wouldn‚Äôt last five minutes... is he really the best the Democrats have to offer/peddle? 77 years old? He is the future for our country? Seriously? Why not Tulsi? Why not anyone else? Biden needs a nursing home, not the seat as the leader of our beloved country.
You'll vote for Joe Biden, not because of anything he has said or stands for, but because he isn't Trump. This is politics 2020 - where people choose the candidate they really like.
This doesn‚Äôt have to be Biden‚Äôs, all of America does it. I‚Äôm not participating in a life like that. He‚Äôs in his basement letting his brain liquefy. No no NO!
Ciornyn has spent 30 years stuck up someones ass. These last 4 years it has been up Trump ass. Major MJ Hegar is a battle tested candidate ready to fight for all Texans &amp; other patriotic Americans against injustice, racism, &amp; Fascism. Joe Biden will need her in the Senate. üëç

"Old-guard white men," those are the people who Biden worked w/ in the U.S. Senate. Dodd is not a bad person, he had a reputation of being a player, and some stories were unflattering, but he wants the same things all Democrats want. U have to let people seek counsel they trust.
See  Supporters are having impact on the Democratic Party so all the more reason to #VoteBlueNoMatterWho &amp; support  and keep fighting for #MedicareForAll with #Biden in the White House
She may very well be Biden‚Äôs pick and now the ones leaking this are mad about it.
They worked in the Senate together for a long time, &amp; everyone has someone who will tell us the unvarnished truth. And, a lifetime in politics exposes people's warts to white-hot light &amp; Dodd has his share. In the end, we will get a woman who Biden can work with, I dig S.Rice.
The only racism I see is from a few dumb individuals who don't know how to live life like the KKK, BLM, Antifa, Obama, BIDEN, I could add a few more up there but your right racism is there just not where the figure is being pointed.
#Trump2020 If you vote for China Joe Biden you are voting for China to become the next world dominant leader by 2030!! You dont realize that do you???!!!! Do your homework. The Democrats are evil and want to divide this Country!! Pls do your home work. The media lies!!
Biden is all talk and no bite.
So I saw this sign pop up in my neighbors yard, they are strong rep and out of town .I texted them and someone put it on their lawn as a prank so of course I asked if I can have it .. so now I‚Äôm proudly displaying my Biden sign that was paid for by a Republican... feels so good.
Nadler is willing to discuss about as much as Chicken Biden
We have to get away from the crazed idiots in the White House &amp; the Republicans to EXPERTS in the field of pandemic viruses. Joe Biden can lead us to that path.
Dodd is a friend whose judgment Biden trusts, you need to use your friends for bouncing ideas off of. There isn't one person who has ever had too much to drink who hasn't done something out of character and that we are sorry for. Chris Dodd is the Dodd on the Dodd-Franks law.
Are you seriously defending Joe Biden?
The person with the most knowledge is Barack Obama's National Security Advisor, and former United Nations Diplomat Susan Rice. Rice would be the most competent replacement should Biden die while in office. Rice knows things NO OTHER person under consideration will ever learn.
I have NO time for any of those never biden assholes anymore. It's all too important.  They're not principled, they're toddlers with tantrums.
Fight for the particular health plan that they want. Joe Biden clearly had a plan that the majority want, otherwise he wouldn't be the frontrunner. You Bernie supporters need to take your L. The playground is closed. Time out for games.
Tom, This isn't BIDEN!!! He can't put a sentence together or a clear thought!!! Who is it????
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ don‚Äôt hold your breath. Corn pops handlers aren‚Äôt about to let the puppet speak without a prepared script. I predict that Biden‚Äôs team will not allow a debate either, mark my words something will happen.
All your criticism has been one sided for the last year or so. Biden showing signs of early dementia seems like a bigger deal than a coach who hasn‚Äôt been relevant for 35 years.
There is no "frontrunner," except in media speculation stories.  Those who are talking don't know, and those who know aren't talking:  #BidenVP #Biden #KamalaHarris
Do you mean implement travel restrictions like Trump did? I just saw what Biden says he would do differently and it was completely unconvincing.
I think he's going to end up somewhere big with the Biden admin and will build up a wonderful administrative and support staff/team who will stick with him wherever he goes after. We will benefit greatly from the work that team does.

Joe Biden is clueless and will only be a puppet the extreme left. That‚Äôs NOT what our country needs nor deserves. All voters need to get informed and by informed that doesn‚Äôt mean CNN or MSNBC whose adgenda is to tear down our Presidents accomplishments with outrageous lies!
I mean... I don‚Äôt know anyone that‚Äôs really gung-ho about Biden, but some people are highly enthusiastic about him based on polling.
If you want China to be the World Dominant country by 2030!! Vote Joe China Biden!! Mark my words! The Democrats are not for America. They are for a different Agenda! I will never vote democratic again! I dont care what Trump did. Man is our only hope!!
Senator Joe Biden, in June 1992, said Bush should not try to fill a vacancy if one should arise. It's on video. Read the Severino/Hemingway book, Justice on Trial. They also describe the lack of evidence against Kavanaugh and how even her "witnesses" didn't support her claims.
Bless you for all you do. I am hoping for you to be the VP pick. I think you &amp; Biden will make a hell of a team. Good luck
The best reason to vote for Biden is that it‚Äôs a vote against Trump, but I understand why that isn‚Äôt good enough for people, including yourself. It seems odd that strongly pro-Biden people (not just anti-Trumpers like me) don‚Äôt have more persuasive things to say.
Careful.  Republicans will use this picture to show what America will be should Biden become President.  Cause... that's what they do.  #TrumpIsACompleteFailure  #52FailedToStand

I hope you don‚Äôt get eaten! The only way America doesn‚Äôt suffer greatly under Biden is if we can stop him from doing what he says he wants to do. Not hype. Facts of the consequences of the policies he says he wants to do!
But we cannot make our choice for president off the hope that the other party can stop the president. I wish there was a better option cause Biden is not a viable option at all and anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or blinded by their hatred for Trump!
We have never had a presidential candidate as bad as Biden. He wants to defund our police and our military and he has flat out said he is coming after those with ‚Äúassault‚Äù weapons to take them away. Now to be fair the rep party may be able to stop him from doing all these things
Right now Biden could choose a Big Mac for his running mate and I think we‚Äôre all still showing up. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Is it? I don‚Äôt think so. I am convinced at best we would go through another Great Depression under Biden just based on his policies alone!
Here are five more:  1. Joe Biden wants to defund the police  2. Mexico will pay for the wall  3. Joe Scarborough killed an intern he was having an affair with  4. Obama left the ‚Äúcupboards bare‚Äù  5. He had the largest inauguration attendance

All these people who will vote for Trump over some petty grievance. Pretty astounding. I don't care at all who Biden picks as his VP. Stacy? Fine. Kamala? Fine. Val? Fine. My least favorite, Liz? Fine. I'm going to vote against Trump.
Nancy Pelosi knows because Biden is leading in all the polls.  Also Democrats don‚Äôt cheat.  They leave the White House cordially when time.  I remember Al Gore and the Bush election, I truely believe Gore won because it was a Florida voting results was questionable.Jeb Bush, Gov.
Donald Trump, for his lies, ineptitude, corruption and criminal behavior, still has the support of 40%.of registered voters. The Republican Party is not going to lose that 40%.  The day after Biden takes office, they will start whining and this election will be forgotten.

So you don't even have ONE accusation of inappropriate behavior with a child and the whole pero Joe crap is just slander.  Thanks for tacitly admitting that.

Bill Clinton and Joe Biden have allegedly attacked women  and children with no consequences from Media or their party. #MeToo
One factor in Biden‚Äôs choice for VP is someone who will be less of a target to Trump (as reported by the N.Y. Times). Are he and his old men allies clueless? ANY woman will be a target. Go for someone tough who can take the abuse and fight back.
My 82-year-old mother, a lifelong Republican, will be voting for Joe Biden. She is so disgusted at Trump‚Äôs self-serving, self aggrandizing behavior that she spits when she speaks of him. Golfing and campaigning while ppl died in nursing homes won‚Äôt win you votes.

People need to wake up and start looking at some of Bidens polices. Unless. the want the United States to turn into Venezuela. How will a Biden Administration affect you personally?
Biden is...anti-DNC?
People said that about Biden in the primaries. Then South Carolina happened. They voted for him over two black candidates because most black voters don't vote based simply on the race of the candidate. At least, nothing in the data shows that they do.
Honestly,  I don't care what letter you put in front of your name but you better hear me. You better start looking at what a Joe Biden Administration would look like. What his policies would be and whom he wants to put where. Don't lission to what he says but what he's written.
Have you ever seen tweets of concern from Biden before running for President ??
Let‚Äôs just for a second say Biden did tweet this.  Why hasn‚Äôt he tweeted concerns of disasters and poverty and BLM etc etc before running for president ??  Because he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck.

This is a great tweet by Joe Biden.  Too bad he doesn‚Äôt know who wrote it.
The plan has been for Biden to be a transitional President, so why would an ambitious VP be an issue? These Dem party fossils apparently don't want to transition to a female POC as the next President. They want a silent placeholder while they groom the next man up. Screw them.
I'm extremely disturbed by this whisper campaign to move the needle on Harris, who is currently the most popular pick for Biden's VP. Calling her "too ambitious" is coded language that she doesn't "know her place". It's sexist, if not worse. (cont'd)

yes biden isn't as bad but he's still a terrible candidate
Just being competitive enough to force the trump campaign to waste resources defending is a victory of its own. I‚Äôm convincing as many former republicans and politically indifferent to participate, and vote for Biden. Should be within single digits barring an October surprise.
A person was stopped and asked who they will vote for. They said Trump because he's turned the country around and will do it again.  Biden been in DC longer than I'm old and hasn't done anything at all.
Well that should officially eliminate bass
It‚Äôs growing, for sure. I‚Äôve been seeing people with Biden masks, bumper stickers, hats, and shirts, as well as a bunch of yard signs, and this is the last republican stronghold in the state (Fort Worth/Tarrant County)
No masks.  You only care when it benefits you.  A publicity stunt.  Vote for Biden!!!
I want Biden to Add more Justices to the Supreme Court and I want Kamala to be one!!
Of course I have no guarantee that any of it would get done. But there was no guarantee that Bernie would have gotten it done either. Of course Biden is still a corporatist establishment guy... but even a little good will be better than whatever is going on right now
I think Kamala Harris has too many skeletons in her closet. It‚Äôs hard to find a politician who doesn‚Äôt but I think Biden might even consider Karen Bass.
I hope Biden chooses Karen Bass, or if not Bass, then Val Demings. Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders - CNNPolitics
I‚Äôm not sayin he‚Äôs great... just saying voting for him now is beneficial to the movement because one more trump justice on the court means Medicare for all is dead for at least 50yrs.. and Biden‚Äôs public option (again not perfect) but it brings us close to M4A
Those two "advisors" need to move on. We don't need their advice. Biden needs to respond!!
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm just saying if you tell me that in 12 years climate change is gonna to do irreparable damage and I weigh my current options....Biden has a 2 trillion dollar plan which is not enough but it better than all of trump‚Äôs deregulation‚Äôs
If Biden picks her after this and the Cuban sympatico, he deserves to lose.  Holy hell.

Biden may have some work to do to secure her vote.
Interesting, thanks. I did something similar and find Biden ahead by 4-5 points. I might be modelling something different though - does your chart show the voting margin in 2016, or the polling margin?
Given every GOP effort to slam Biden has failed miserably thus far, you know they are just waiting for the VP pick to have a plausible stalking horse.
Rasmussen also says Biden is ahead by 6. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
I'm contributing to Democratic Senate candidates now. I think Biden will win and Dems will keep the House, what we need is to get rid of folks like Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham,etc. to pass  progressive legislation ASAP.
Prediction: Biden voters vote by mail and Trump voters in person. Trump only goes by OAN coverage who declare states way early for Trump. He declares victory early and gears up to sue states regarding any change in results.

Biden also needs to execute the law so that everyone responsible for Trump's bungling is held accountable. Biden will not tread softly but he might need a big stick.
So what happens if Joe Biden picks a white man as VP?
The first 100 days are significant for any president worth his mettle. Biden can't afford to be quiet his first 100 days. If he get a majority in both houses of Congress, Biden needs to work with Congress to get everything back to Obama presets, erasing all GOP damage.

conveniently forgot to mention that  condemned Trump for the immediate action he did take early on in banning travel from China. How much worse would this be under a Biden admin?
Biden wouldn't even have to climb a ladder to get to Congress like Richard Coke had to in order to get to the Texas Legislature (which met on the 2nd floor of the Capitol) after Gov. Edmund Davis refused to leave office in 1873.
Perhaps we could've NOT settled for Biden and nominated someone else.....
What does being a Christian have to do with observing that someone seems to not be well?To be honest, when I heard Biden‚Äôs speech, I was very proud to be an American. He praised our country &amp; our military. I thought he gave a very good speech. In my opinion, he‚Äôs not the same.

Why? Biden is leading and he needs to maintain that lead and not let criticism of his VP pick by the Trump campaign change that in any way. He needs to go through all the ways the Trump campaign could react especially if they drop Pence and/or plan an after-Labor Day surprise.

It's a tough call. Biden has been in office longer, so probably in the long run has done more damage. But Obama started a firestorm that will take a long time to recover from.
You mean like when you said Biden saying trump would try and delay vote a conspiracy theory, and then he tweeted about delaying vote???
üò≥ 50 million people have filed for unemployment benefits. And you were saying this guy can create jobs??? All you have is just fear and denigration. No agenda or plan in the way Joe Biden does. To build back and build back for the future, not the dark ages.
If Trump is going to not run for re-election, or switch Pence out for Hailey, this would be the time to do it.  Next week is when Biden is going to announce his Veep.  I would expect a Monday announcement if it‚Äôs something major.
It's really kind of sad.  The number of guffaws, mixups, erroneous numbers, etc just continues to grow.  Grandpa Joe needs just hang it up and go enjoy his retirement years and he certainly doesn't have the cognitive skills to be President.

Please don't vote until you've done some cursory research into Biden and his relationship with China.
This is a dark thought but what happens if Biden d**s.

Six months ago today, Joe Biden published an opinion piece in WaPo calling for swift, decisive action on a nationwide response to coronavirus. Trump spent the next six weeks holding rallies, calling it a hoax, golfing, and sending supplies to China and Russia. #Biden2020
Obama - Biden team sold off our factories to China, left borders open to MS13, and allowed violent crime to plaque our cities. Want 8 more years of that? vote BIDEN.
He's a challenge I offer anyone with the dumbassed pego shit for VP Biden - find one example of anyine claiming he actually did anything inappropriate with a child.  Just one will do.  And they need to make an accusation of inappropriateness.  Just one.

Wrong.  Here are 2 layups: Barak Obama and Joe Biden.  You are engaging in ridiculous hyperbole.  If you are referring to the hearings with AG Barr and ignoring the clown show of Democrats, then your bias is showing loud and clear.
Over the past 3-1/2 years I‚Äôve learned that what we see &amp; say on Twitter is typically a lousy snapshot of the reality of things on the street. Progressive Twitter also celebrated Sanders‚Äô candidacy and is still trying to undermine Biden; the real-world response has been: eff off.
You miss the point. What they have received is billions in welfare, in all its forms, and they want a lot more, in the form of reparations. Biden will provide that so blacks will vote for him, not Trump. It‚Äôs very simple. Calling democrats racist isn‚Äôt changing anything.
Who cares! Trump and Biden are both frauds! Trump is permitting the deaths of Americans while bowing to Fauci! Steroid nebulizer treatment with 100% cure rate other countries are using no matter how many times covid mutates!
Biden doesn't care about us, he's entitled to our support.
No, just one girl...
Apparently Twitter is a pro trump platform bc inspite of all these so-called polls showing Biden is a shoe-in in November,  every poll taken on twitter as to Trump approval rating, etc., has him getting an 80 to 90% plus rating, on the economy,  the CV, the wall, you pick one.
Well, this is damning.
biden see ghosts sometimes and i want the world to know :‚Äô)
I think the odds Biden makes it to the election as the nominee are slim.  That is, unless the Democrats know they are going to lose and are sacrificing him.  Their convention may be interesting.
1/A co-founder of the Federalist Society-Steven Calabresi - an ultra conservative group - calls Trump a ‚ÄúFascist‚Äù &amp;says he will NOT be voting Republican this fall 4 the 1st time since 1980! Implying  he will be voting 4 Joe Biden for President this fall.
But Biden called him racist and thought it was the wrong idea when President Trump closed down travel with China. Biden then had to walk back that position. So who was right?

By gasses I tought you meant some holocaust type shit. But yeah, Biden has gassed his own citizens with tear gas. But trump has increased that exponentially aswell. Is it that hard to comprehend.
Biden saw it coming; Trump lied that it was a hoax, played golf, put Jared in charge, and 100,000 Americans are dead as a result. What more does anyone need to know? #Biden2020
Firstly by man child, I mean adults literally acting like infants. Secondly I said that he consided some of bernies progressive policies. And compared to trump, he would be the progressive candidate. And third of all I never talked about gasses.. I acknowledge that Biden

Let‚Äôs keep it going with fear.....just to get Biden elected via cheating
Ah yes republicans like trump, who have increasingly made the state more powerful and authoritarian, literally gassed his own citizens is compatible to Biden, and brain dead smuck, who has voted for bad things, but nevertheless recognizes that those decisions weren‚Äôt good ones
Oh we will.  Biden will beat u in a blowout.  There will be no doubt about the outcome....  Get ready for jail...  BTW, didn‚Äôt your Daddy go to Klan meetings??? #pospotus

I‚Äôm not denying that, but like internal policies, Biden is far more better than nothing
Looks like Barry followed in the footsteps of sharpton. He took a eulogy for a representative and pissed all over it and turned his funeral into a campaign speech for joe Biden...

It‚Äôs July 31,2020 and time for your daily Biden. So if you can stand in a line at a grocery store multiple times a week, why can‚Äôt you stand in line to vote? Only one reason - cheat with mail in ballots. Don‚Äôt fall for Democrats lies.
I voted for Jerry Rice. That's Biden's VP, right?
Where was the social distancing at the funeral? Put on a mask and vote....Dem‚Äôs plan to have their dead family members vote has been found out.....sorry try again!  Biden as president is a no go.

Good. Gives #darkhorseduo more time. Hoping biden cracks a hip and bows out and endorses yang.

Sorry, Legs-up. Trump will lose in NY and California,  but he'll carry the states that actually count for true Americans who want what's best for America. And that is NOT Sleepy Joe Biden.
YES! and he should be embarrassed about giving a campaign speech during his eulogy yesterday. I don't think Trump would do this at a funeral. SO TACKY!! Get out OBAMA. We don't want you or Biden around anymore!

Joe Biden is effectively shutting down that debate. He's not interested in single-payer at all. He's said so in so many words.  How the hell is calling him out on that "bad faith"? Your statements are more bad faith than Bri's.
It‚Äôs funny.  Both Obama and Biden claim to have all the answers to our problems, but they FAILED during their 8 years.  In Biden‚Äôs case he‚Äôs been working on the same stuff for over 40 years= nothing!! What the hell has Biden been doing for 40 years???
Biden is a puppet...I‚Äôm amazed the left think hes the best candidate.   Riding BHO‚Äôs wave of failed policies.  Can you outlaw the Dem‚Äôs in your second term please?  The time has come for 2 pro-American parties to run.  Thanks for what you do..
I would not care if the caught Biden in a hotel room with a bag of cocaine a hooker and a pirate I'm still voting for him!!!
The GOP is interfering.....they look greedy and out of touch.  Unemployment and GDP reduction....they are trying to cut the fed money by 2/3 with the belief everyone will just go back to work.  No jobs to go to Jeb...GOP needs to step up or insert Biden, spells disaster.
If Biden wins the Russians did it.
It‚Äôs not a stutter.  It‚Äôs the inability to articulate sentences, forgetting where he is, who he is and what he‚Äôs running for.  I wouldn‚Äôt criticize someone for a stutter.  I have a friend who has one.  What Biden does is not a stutter.  Watch this:

That wasn‚Äôt Biden‚Äôs making but let‚Äôs agree that he was involved &amp; the Bill has been derided by  as a terrible law against minorities - that gets Biden an F- in my book
Find one single law developed and passed by Biden in his 30+ years parasitic Policial life in favor of the police ... it‚Äôs easy to judge Biden for what he did/didn‚Äôt 3 years ago BUT his legacy is beyond the past administration
No we aren‚Äôt. Many people are dreading the beautiful United States sliding into a toilet of left wing politically correct totalitarianism, where mass illegal immigration is encouraged,and the liberty of the individual is crushed by the State. Biden is a disaster waiting to happen

Obama is campaigning for his third term he will be running the country if Biden is elected.  #Trump2020 #Freedom #MAGA
He *is* hiding in his basement, though. Probably for the best, I'd rather Biden wins, tbh.
In eight years of Obama Biden we never saw the kind of violence and hate and division that we‚Äôve seen in the last 3 1/2 years with Trump so that shit don‚Äôt fly

I say pass a law. Call their bluff. Call it the Hunter Biden is corrupt Act for all I care. They won‚Äôt do it because the legislators themselves don‚Äôt want that gravy train to end.
Sounds like you're describing Democrats like Biden an Obama

But that‚Äôs under the Trump administration. Lindsey is a chameleon and has no problems with contradicting himself when the environment changes. He will probably get chummy with Biden again once Trump is out of the picture.
I would love that!!! But I feel for Joe Biden. This is a bigger mess than GWB left.
Another big O scandal. Oops sorry, he‚Äôs not president now. Talk about a bigot, did he forget MULES were a primary source, including Biden, of targeting blacks years ago.
It‚Äôs just a little opposition research. Nothing to worry about. I‚Äôm sure it will be enough evidence for Barr to run surveillance on the Biden campaign.
Biden wasn‚Äôt our first choice, but that‚Äôs the card we got dealt.  Idk why people who are most likely going to vote Democrat in November still spend time bashing him.

Sure Biden is bad, but trump is baDER. He has had many more rape accusations, all with evidence. But it‚Äôs like choosing getting shot with a gun 7 times, or 1 time in the arm. Sure, not an Isela situation, but nevertheless choosing getting shot only 1 time is the best choice

This is about delaying a publicly accessible treatment until November 4th! The Left is pulling out all the stops to get Biden elected!  Hydroxychloroquine works!!!
Yes. He does. When Joe Biden wins in November. It will be great.
Oh, look, an entire thread of all the times Republicans or Republican media criticizes Joe Biden as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù for suggesting Trump would try to delay the election.
A vote for Trump is a vote for Trump.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.  A vote third party is a vote for Trump.
Biden was glad to assist Barry-O, bored floating along in Congress. ‚ÄúYou got the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy."  Lewis, Jackson, Clyburn, Sharpton, Waters must have pushed to get in line behind somnambulant Joey.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt want Biden either, yuck.
Watch and retweet.. new Biden video!  #EvictTrump #WeWillVote #VoteBlueToSaveDemocracy
Girlfriend you aren‚Äôt good at this. Moms, Aunts, Sisters, Daughters, Grandmas are all voting for Biden. And we know safety of Americans is His main concern, unlike your boyfriend‚Äôs Daddyü§¢
Good to know Joe Biden‚Äôs assistant.
Right!! You got two choices, Joe Biden or the Orange fuck Trump. We know what Biden is about and we dying seeing what Trump is about. I choose to live and have a brighter day. I‚Äôm voting for Biden.
...deemed too favorable to Joe Biden...‚Äù.  your going to be busy firing and hiring in your 1st 100 days.
Sorry I‚Äôm voting for Biden
A vote for Biden is a vote for China.
It could be a Biden/Chickenshit ticket as far as I'm concerned.  I trust his judgement.  #Biden2020
#BarakObamaIsARacist   I say we start rioting unti they unseal Hussein‚Äôs records!   America has had enough of this BS!! Obama/Biden  got us here, #Trump is our ONLY way out!   How did Obama come into politics as a poor coke head and leave a multi-millionaire?  #SilentNoMore
You backed the fascist. It‚Äôs sad, but doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Biden was correct to predict Trump would try this and you were wrong to support Trump. Enjoy the ashes of your legal reputation. Hope burning them at the Trump alter was worth it.
Hey all...let's all say we're voting for him. Let's lie to pollsters.  And when the nov results come in, (hopefully with a HUGE Biden landslide)  he can't say " it's close! Its a hoax, or its rigged".
That‚Äôs right Mr Biden, now finish your pudding.
Beautiful little girl. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs missed dearly. We will get Biden in and get some sensible gun control, but we need to flip SENATE as well. So everyone please VOTE!!
I was half-expecting to see Joe Biden pop up from behind the casket and throw BIDEN t-shirts into the crowd.
Trump continues to warn us that if Biden is elected, the streets will be full of the sort of riots and violence that they are currently full of now.
Ya think they're not everywhere thanks to Obama/Biden?
Lies lies lies. democrats always LIE. Biden doesn‚Äôt have a clue. The debates probably won‚Äôt happen the poor man couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day.
Your attacks on Biden are terrible!  You realize you work for the most disliked person in the world.  I bet Kim Jong Un is liked by more people than #DamagedDonnie.  He‚Äôs an embarrassment and the worst POTUS I‚Äôll see in my lifetime.
Trump will eat Biden alive during the debates &amp; he will be a total embarrassment. The man didn‚Äôt even know where he was the other day.  Sad the democrats are propping up a man who doesn‚Äôt have a clue but they deserve it. What‚Äôs that saying you reap what you sow.
He‚Äôs Protecting us from vile left wing radicals burning destroying &amp; looting. Plus I don‚Äôt want a pervert in the White House we had one before in Bill boy Clinton he‚Äôs the one who flew on Epstein‚Äôs plane 50 times. Biden can‚Äôt keep his hands off any little girl he‚Äôs disgusting.
You only like Biden because you know he will run the country like Bush 43.
Stick to ... whatever the fuck it is you do. If Biden was president, the virus would be far more under control and the chances of a FULL college football season would be greater. You really are a stupid b*tch.
I disagree, I think Biden is 100% senile...the guys lost his cognitive thought process.
This graphic implies that 270 gets reached at FL. But, by my math, if Biden wins PA &amp; WI and everything to the left of them, he's at 274, even without FL + NH. What am I missing?
Who‚Äôs pushing politics now Jane! Obama used a eulogy for a Black civil rights leader to promote Biden who has never done a damn thing for the Black community!
No lie, Biden wins if he dodges Trump but the moment they debate, Trump will eat him like he did Jeb Bush. There is even a conspiracy (not factual but sounds like something that could happen) Biden will get Corona and therefore Kamala Harris will debate Trump for him
I dont know for sure but say hes impeached and removed tommorrow. I dont think thats an automatic win for biden, either pence or someone else runs in his place. Im not an expert though
Biden is the one who will quit. Probably before the debates. He couldn‚Äôt remember where he was the other day. By the time of the debates the man won‚Äôt know his face from his ass. Thanks dumbocrats for giving us a man with Dementia and early stages of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  MAGAMAGAMAGA
If liberals believed in this I would support Biden
Lots of reasons, but the main one is that you can‚Äôt tell me that Biden is going to win over the states that Hillary couldn‚Äôt that would get him to 270.
Typical left wing radical propaganda. Trump is a winner not a loser. If he quits the presidency he will go down the biggest Loser in history. He will never quit he will fight for the American people to the bitter end. The debates will be an eye opener if they happen.  Biden  üò¥
Lots of reasons, but the main one is that you can‚Äôt tell me that Biden is going to win over the states that Hillary couldn‚Äôt that would get him to 270.
It's not what Biden said or says. Just tell us what you say. We do support lawful policing. We do not support militarization of police forces. We do not support federalization of policing. We do support prosecution of those who loot, vandalize and are violent. Any questions?
OMG, he doesn't know what planet he's on, let alone what state he's in. Electing Joe Biden is basically electing the VP to the highest office in the land. And my guess is they're teeing up Michelle or Barack HIMSELF!!
Just know Biden won.
Thats how politicians funnel $$$$.... Look how Joe Biden got his son millions
Biden is gonna turn to Kissinger for guidance
Joe Biden: please nominate Barack Obama as your running Vice President!
That was back when Biden could string a few coherent words together. Still got it wrong.
To me, this says Biden is behind by 10 points in NH and we all have to work even harder now.
I will tell you the results now.  #Biden wins.  You are out!
And it's a blessing - an unmitigated blessing - that he  didn't attend. The funeral made clear, as Biden makes clear every time he speaks, we do not have a president. The presidency is occupied by a malignancy.
I wish Trump hadn't mishandled this response so you could get out and meet more people, because Biden us currently winning here.
He should have said that he is voting for  I mean what the hell is he waiting for?
Couple that with this turtle walk on #SPYGATE indictments... you can bet if Biden wins, ALL documents/files will be long gone n case closed.
Sorry but I‚Äôll be voting for Biden. Trump is a laughing Stock üòÇüòÇ.
this woman is so desperate.  All of the DEMORat Party is in panic mode because they have been CAUGHT. CAUGHT IN YEARS AND YEARS OF LIE'S, CORRUPTION, STEALING FROM THE PEOPLE, CAUGHT IN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT including PEDOPHILIA,. OBAMA n BIDEN  have been CAUGHT in Ukraine
I've never met a Conservative for Joe Biden. Millions huh?
‚ÄúLike, this is easy,‚Äù George Clooney said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two candidates here. One claims that our first Black president wasn‚Äôt a citizen, and the other was his vice president.‚Äù
Biden is getting 92 percent black support. Trump only getting 8 percent in 2020 yeah your so right Trump has done such a great job with Blacks üòÇüòÇ. Let‚Äôs delay the elections. The only man who says dumb stuff like that is when they know they will lose badly.
So Biden could become the second. He speaks Jibberish. That counts right?
üìå¬†Biden‚Äôs Anti-Woman Plan:
Nice opinion piece. Now do real life and post the story about Biden running on the Sanders/AOC socialists platform.
I voted for her in the primaries. now it looks like the best we might be able to hope for is that she becomes Biden's vice president and is in charge via de facto information-filtering through a man who was nowhere near as qualified.  You know, Peak America.
Bullshit. You‚Äôre just making things up. Biden was the overwhelming winner of the primary and there are almost no instances of meaningful mail in voter fraud this year.
6pm w/  4:20: David Horowitz, "the Blitz--Trump will smash the Left and win"; Susan Rice, in the running as Joe Biden's VP, says the Obama Admin. gave Trump a "Pandemic for Dummies" Playbook. üéß ‚û°Ô∏èÔ∏è
Yes Biden is bigly
Media: No funerals! No campaign rallies!  Today Biden has a campaign rally at a funeral.    Media...crickets.
Then I hope you aren't voting for Biden.
YES!!!  's guest this week thought she would be an excellent VP also, because Biden will need a vice president who can step into the presidency on zero notice. And Elizabeth Warren is ready to be president right now.
Biden 2020 baby!!
Biden should be replaced if the Democrats have any chance to beat Trump. His Mental health is makes him unfit to be President. #ABC
Ever think it's a tacticle move.Hes not stupid ..This is a 4D chess master move .BIDEN NEEDS TO COME TO DEBATE
I‚Äôll be voting for Biden
Not going to lie. I‚Äôve never seen someone in my 52 years that I want to see lose as much as Trump. I hope it‚Äôs a biblical ass whipping. Is Joe Biden my choice? Nope. But Trump needs to go down in a historical manner to shut his ignorant fat mouth.
Biden doesn't know wether to scratch his watch or wind his ass
We all look forward to Joe Biden .. You are just not good for our country the last 4 years tell us that
I dont think Biden is gonna make it. They are waiting to the last minute to pull him out and put someone else in.
You know people are excited about voting when there‚Äôs literally a movement called ‚ÄúSettle For Biden.‚Äù
No sane person would vote for Biden
Your other tweets say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared‚Äù. ‚ÄúBiden is gonna win in a landslide ‚Äú because #NobodyLikesTrump  Don‚Äôt delay the election. Just #ResignNow  Not even MAGA believes you.
Because we can‚Äôt take another day/month/week/year of this evil, racist, wanna-be dictator in the WH #WeWillVote #Biden
Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology?  via
Hate to break it to you but.....he didn't have the majority in 2016 and people like Biden better! Where is her going to manufacture these votes? Should we worry about fraud from his side? Is that why he is so worried about it? Unreal 500 million votes cast! Lol
BREAKING NEWS:  #Biden has not specified how #COVID-19 outcome would be different under his watch.   QUESTION: Who has best record on rebuilding the economy?
if it only reveals that certain officials engaged in an attempt to weaken the president and drive a bogus investigation forward, it would condemn Democrats who have defended the Mueller investigation, including Joe Biden.
BIDEN IS A BURNT CURTAIN
Now this is a great question. Great article:
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for Biden and hate speech on Trump
Now this is a great question
This is a great question
Biden only needs to win 3 battleground states to defeat Trump ‚Äì and he's leading in all 6
"I have a great idea!  Let's run against both Jie Biden and Barack Obama in 2020", said no Republican strategist ever.
..yet on the other hand, Biden is SUPER boring. I think between Biden's lack of charisma, Trump looking weak, and COVID, this is going to be a record low turnout, and it's going to come down to which side is less interested.   Force me to answer, and I'd give the edge to Biden.
Sounds like Biden‚Äôs got it in the bag then. Nothing to worry about right? I sincerely hope that EVERY citizen gets out there and votes.
That would be a slap in the face to every black person that backed Biden.
He‚Äôs a few minutes away from saying Biden should be thrown in jail and he should run unopposed. This is Mugabe/Putin/etc bulls***
Secret Service dragging his ass out of the White House after Biden is sworn in is fine with me.
Biden slams Trump, McConnell for 'political games' with further coronavirus aid
Hence, we must vote for Biden in a massive landslide
Joe Biden will cut your taxes. Trump will cut the taxes of the rich people so they‚Äôll get even richer. üí£üéä
PELOSI:  COME TO CHINATOWN!  EAT, DRINK AND SHOP!  IT'S SAFE! BIDEN:  THE PRES IS XENOPHOBIC!  HE WON'T LET THE CHINESE FLY HERE!  Who should pay?
I agree with you. The 2 party system isn‚Äôt working anymore. Both are corrupt and ineffective. But, this is not the election to make that point. Right now, it is either or... you are wasting your vote if you don‚Äôt vote for Biden. America can‚Äôt endure 4 more years of Trump!
If Biden wants to double down on a ‚Äòthird Obama term,‚Äô he should pick Susan Rice
How Kamala Harris rose from California's 'top cop' to Joe Biden's potential vice presidential running mate
50 yrs of  &amp; suddenly he's on the hunt, going to be what he hasn't been in 50 yrs? A 'clean, articulate' black novice picked him for his experience! (Gates: Biden's always been wrong on foreign policies.) A moderate, a Progressive, which?  Biden..this dog don't hunt.
If Trump got removed, and Pence took over, Biden would lose the election easy. Not that this would ever happen, but for sure factual.
Joe Biden is 77... In the mortality rate of males 75 to 79 is 4,193 per 100,000 (80 to 84 is 6,901)  So there is greater than a 4.1% chance of him dying each year he is in office.  So about an 18% chance that he just dies in office of natural causes.  They just need to be ready.
Fuck Trump and Biden........and what ?!
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty - The Boston Globe
Joe Biden is quite possibly the worst candidate to ever run or president. Mentally broken and morally corrupt...who agrees?
Well, Biden has a plan to create climate jobs during a time we will need jobs, tackling two issues at once.  Pretty smart idea IMO and a way to make tackling climate change less partisan...  See, there you go!
BIDEN IS A BURNT CURTAIN
We won't allow Joe Biden near the White House. The silent majority is real, and we will vote to re elect
Where‚Äôs Tara Reade? Also the video compilation of Joe Biden fondling little children is gone... hmmm ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sorry...All Biden supporters are pedophiles.
And if Biden gets 270, what's the difference?
I'll be sure to let all of these people your targeting g know what your doing. Your fake ppl with no lives that do this. Its freedom to say what you want on here. Wait a sec, its not, twitter is a biden biased company
VOTE BIDEN 2020 - HE‚ÄôS NOT A WHINY BITCH!
So you‚Äôre suggesting I‚Äôm a racist for supporting trump?  I‚Äôd rather be a racist Asian trump supporter than a black pedophile Biden supporter.  See what I did there?
He lost track of being at a funeral, thought he was at a Rally for him and Joe Biden!!!!
#BLM has been silent on:  The character asassiantion of Dr. Stella Immanuel   Politicization of Herman Cain‚Äôs death  MSNBC mocking Rep. Vernon Jones   Biden saying ‚Äúyou ain‚Äôt black‚Äù  &amp; finally black officers killed in the riots.  It was never about black lives to begin with
I got it from DeBlasio, Pelosi who took it so seriously that they lobbied to keep their China towns open.  I took it from Joe Biden, who called Trump a racist for shutting China travel down.   I took it from Adam Scuff, who dragged the Administration in a wasted impeachment scam.
No China will be and all the lying liberals all over the news on CNN, ABC &amp; MSNBC that downplayed it, telling us not to worry, that we have recorded on video before the Spring , plus Biden making fun of POTUS‚Äô early travel ban, along with the evil W.H.O. that told us it was NBD!

Anybody else think Biden is just gonna pick another old white dude for his VP because fuck everyone?
I'm doing the same. My desire to see Trump ousted outweighs my desire to not vote for Biden.
Calling it now... The American flag will be regarded as "offensive" within the next 10 years, (5 years if Biden wins the election). #nihilistic #progressivism #wokeism
Biden's going to win Texas  If we work hard, we can drop these fools in '22
üòÇüòÇüòÇ if they‚Äôre voting for Biden they‚Äôre uninformed about everything and getting educated is a slim chance
Watched some, I don't know about Biden, Pelosi did!
I believe any FOIA request can attain the document. I'm quite certain it is real [it exists]. The question is did JFK Jr send it or did someone acting as him? (which would be an odd thing to fake, to pose as JFK Jr and send a letter to Biden accusing him of being a traitor)
when did james woods become such a deuce ? I remember watching him in early 2000s he was such a nice guy. idc bout his politics but he never seem to have anything nice to say bout anyone. but point taken . democrats could ve chosen someone better than biden
Gross that this divisive manipulative ex-prez used a funeral this. Especially when Joe Biden can‚Äôt speak for himself.
Biden is only 3 years older than trump &amp; a lot more sane
When he loses on November 3, I think the scariest time in our history will be the days after the election until  January 20, 2021 when President Biden is sworn in! Gut check time for ALL, White, Black, man, woman, republican, Democratic to make sure we survive this madman.
Biden is on some kind of secret happy drug or something.  This is there guy?  Really?
We dont want Joe Biden as President. They are both crooks. One has be3n around for 50 yrs and hasnt done shit for the American people. All of a sudden a new guy comes along that knows everything about all the Democrats and now the democrats are squirming!! Obama is Satanic
I thought the Biden fundraising texts and e-mails were pushy.  The Trump ones are just downright rude and abusive!
No we do not need to change the election date. Biden may or may not be the answer but Trump is definitely not the answer.
Trump is terrified and can't figure a way out  Constitutionally impossible': Experts say Trump can't postpone the November election The president, trailing Joe Biden in the polls, teased delaying the election over fears of the kind of voter fraud that does not exist.
What was he doing when he was president besides making memes with Biden??? He had all the power back then to do this why didn‚Äôt he then?
Depends on if she swallowed when she....Well, You know. Biden doesnt like evidence left on his clothing.
No but u can get a fuck Biden
The media and the Democrats as a whole completely underestimated Biden and his popularity.
Even Biden doesn‚Äôt believe you.
No, Biden‚Äôs election won't end the nightmare by
Culture will be front and center for Biden and the Dems. Republicans need to respond strongly and confidently.
Your ignorance shows. I was watching the news before spring when all the liberal media were totally downplaying Covid along with evil W.H.O. Biden was criticizing Trump for his early travel ban!! Anderson Cooper saying the seasonal flu is worse. Democrats are all liars
She‚Äôs my choice too. If not, maybe Biden should appoint EW to a Jared-like position so that she can run everything. Then for VP: Rice, Michelle, Jarrett, Duckworth, Bass, or Abrams.
There‚Äôs ALWAYS a #FoxNews video that actually plays out the EXACT opposite they tout to their #Trump base! THIS WAS FROM APRIL..... tweeted it, TODAY! üñïüèºüñïüèº #fucktrump #Biden #RidenWithBiden2020
We‚Äôll be fine as soon as Biden is president.
Too bad he isn‚Äôt running for President! F Biden.
I believe that in the 2024 election, Harris should be on the ballot.  Not 2020.  Harris dropped out earlier than many because she did not have the support.  Biden needs someone who will bring support (other than Bernie Sanders).
He and his GOP has done so much damage that it will take Biden and his congress and senators at least a year to undo the damage.
Biden, Pelosi and the Democrats could possibly seal victory just by saying "We will repeal the 2006 PAEA and restore stability to the US Postal Service."  Why won't they?
Joe Biden is kicking ass in Texas. You‚Äôre going to lose this state
Yup and sadly that‚Äôs exactly who Joe Biden is too and yet we will be forced to vote for him. üò±
Obama effectively used the funeral of John Lewis to keep the Democrat race baiting agenda alive by spewing civil rights propaganda nonsense that he &amp; Biden could have handled during their time in the Oval Office. Guess it wasn‚Äôt important then. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Oh!  And I‚Äôm usually against name calling but ANYONE that thinks Biden is a better choice...is a complete fool!
Well, if you plan on Biden doing any better, then I feel for you.
I‚Äôve said many times...show me something better and I‚Äôll vote for it...but I‚Äôm not voting for socialism, pandering, and ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù!  Certainly not voting for a man like Biden that can‚Äôt string a few original thoughts together!
It‚Äôs a campaign speech for lying Biden. Surprised the family let him do this. Shame on them
Not a Biden fan either, my remark was not partisan. Weak candidates on both sides.
is amazing and I hope she has a large role somewhere in the Biden administration!!
What???? Obama was not President in January nor was Biden Vice President. What are you talking about??!
Isn't Biden horrid....
Campaign speech for Lying Biden. Was no funeral.  All a put on
I agree with everything you just said except, for me, replace Warren w/Beto.  I have been arguing this point the minute Biden won SC  Outside of cable media &amp; woke Twitter most people do not care if Biden picks Harley Quinn.  Most just want that Apocalyptic Apricot AntiChrist out
He‚Äôs campaigning for lying Biden. Lol. Disgusting that Lewis‚Äôs family let this go on
Biden looks like Mr. Magoo.  üòÇ
Wow, Biden‚Äôs really going to win in November huh....
People who think Biden won‚Äôt use secret police make me laugh because Obama was the one who signed that power to the president   Both sides of the same coin
Under Biden where that money could be used elsewhere.  You can say what you want about corporations, but small businesses are getting taxed the same as big corporations.  If you are a business owner where you do not get paid on time, seeing that
via  We the people will carry out Mr. Lewis ‚ÄòUnbreakable Perseverance‚Äô and vote for Joe Biden for POTUS 2020. #VoteHimOut
...Biden is a pedophile. I don‚Äôt support either one, but that shit is disturbing.
This is the main reason I don't support Rice for VP. All we would hear until the election is BENGHAZI BENGHAZI BENGHAZI, which would have the Trump idiots giddy.
Blue woman is there to protect BidenNope. This is exactly why Biden should not have said he was going to pick a woman. Every racist and sexist mofo in the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù media and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Twitter are showing their ü©≤
Not bashing Bass. I refuse to drag a woman of color that is up for VP   But üëáüèæ may be a problem for Biden‚Äôs core base, black church women. Some may see Scientology as too fringe. They are not as feral about mixing faith &amp; politics as white evangelicals, but faith does play a part
It doesn't matter who the Democratic Candidate is they will always find something to bitch about.  For the mess we are in right now, Biden is perfect to make this horrendous experiment of Anti-Democracy go away.  Sign way any of the Trump ignorance &amp; right this ship.
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!
Where is Hunter Biden now? When will he admit to his crimes?
Sorry Deb. Trump wasn‚Äôt involved. He‚Äôs still your President. Will be. Oh BTW, BIDEN owns the island right next to EPSTEIN‚ÄôS PEDO island...Guess what will be coming up next???
The island right next to Epstein‚Äôs pedo island is owned by Biden. Grand sniffin‚Äô party days!
‚ÄúBut Biden doesn‚Äôt need a Black VP, he‚Äôs already got the Black vote.‚Äù As if Black people exist only for political purposes?? -_-
With the way 2020 has gone so far, do we really know who the Presidential candidate for each party will be? What's to say that either or both Trump and Biden have colossal physical or mental breakdowns.
Biden targets religious voters. But has there ever been a more tortured twist of scripture than to equate redemption and restoration with Marxism and socialism?
why did you like this comment omg
Eeeew any one who talks about another human like that is a predator no matter the gender
I couldn‚Äôt finish listening to that omg
If you are a Republican and think Trump is a loser or a liar, do not vote for him. You do not have to vote for Joe Biden. That may be asking too much. Salvage some of your dignity.
You do know Biden is seriously sick right? He doesn‚Äôt know where he is.
My totally Novice Q is, Since Biden is being briefed on ‚Äúthings‚Äù would he or would he not be obtaining briefs on such materials especially since it includes a questionable at best member of Intel Commity? And involvement in impeachment hearing clown show??
He wasn‚Äôt involved. I know you lefties are hoping n wishing, but the reality is Trump is the one trying to stop sex trafficking, not Obama, and certainly not the Clintons. Biden OWNS the island 10 miles away from Epstein. Ghislane owns submarines. It‚Äôs coming out soon...
No Biden sticker on it so very doubtful
It is apparent after that divisive speech, who will be pulling Biden's puppet strings.  Praying for the Durham Report.  d
Obama will be pulling Biden's puppet strings if Biden wins.       Obama will be the real mouthpiece.
Biden will do whatever Obama wants.  Obama is pulling Biden's strings.  If Biden wins, 4 more years of Obama.  Looks like Obama is making another run for "President".  Praying for the Durham Report to take this cocky a-hole down.
Biden will do whatever Obama wants.  Obama is pulling Biden's strings.  If Biden wins, 4 more years of Obama.
Biden will do whatever Obama wants.  Obama is pulling Biden's strings.  If Biden wins, 4 more years of Obama.
Well, after Obama's speech at John Lewis's funeral, Obama will be the one pulling Biden's strings.

this is what I meant by clarifying. leftists hate biden for shit exactly like this. don‚Äôt lump biden in with the great names u mentioned before
what sleight of hand do u righties use to relate socialism with racism i can‚Äôt understand. u just need to browse twitter to see how the majority of leftists feel about biden. i understand i came on ur page to unwelcome territory but trust I‚Äôm just here tryna clarify things ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Not just sexism. I haven‚Äôt read about Warren and Kloubachar too ‚Äúambitious‚Äù for Biden to pick as VP.
I love the passion of this physician. I cannot believe how disrespectful our main stream news media speaks of her, including Joe Biden. Seems racist.
If Biden was choose Tulisa there is big hope because she powerful and has great idea for the American people
There is not one SANE black woman, whether they are Skateboards, KHive, Petedctyls, Latter Day Lizzies, No Malarkies,Kloubacharians, Castrations, Gang of Yang, or Booker Tees (Branch Bernardians are not sane), will be hurt or pissed if Biden chooses a qualified black woman or WOC
Is that the statement where Biden implied Trump was Xenophobic for restricting travel from China?
This is a false equivalence, Sis. For one thing, there is not one SANE black woman who will be pissed or hurt if Biden picks another black woman or a WOC(except, maybe black Latter Day Lizzies, and even with them, I am not comfortable making them an exception)
Doubt it.. What does Biden have to offer other than a rambling Incoherent babble?
Should Biden quit the race? It is hard not to question motives when there is no police report and desire is for a settlement. Going to same reporters who torched team earlier not a great look imho. Mavs female staff members ultimately made the call. NBA can ban him entirely.
No matter how much you might dislike Trump.  Why would you even vote for Biden?  He is obviously mentally compromised and delusional.  He needs to be in a Hospice
No matter How much someone dislikes Trump how can anyone believe this is a better choice.  I firmly believe Biden is mentally incapacitated and could not even order a Happy Meal at McDonald's
Can you please go to YouTube &amp; review? Biden was great; time has caught up with him. I can envision  being presented at the DNC
Trump until the Dems can figure out a quality candidate. Biden and Hillary are trash
Biden‚Äôs America .....
Joe Biden will bring sanity back to the Government.   He will be focus on the USA and won't be in bed with Putin.
Love is in the air. Joe Biden really loves his grandchildren.
I believe Biden is being led by the arm, without a mask, without having been tested for COVID-19, from a room with many unmasked people. I think this is his granddaughter who he kisses on the lips frequently.
And that is the scary part! People planning to vote for Biden have no idea who will really be running the country. Biden‚Äôs handlers would be able to do as they please without repercussions.
‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm Joe Biden, and idiots will vote for me.‚Äù
wish you were the nominee and not gross joe biden.
#CBS seriously asking if there's an enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden! Ya think?
Seriously?!?! CNN lies ALL day long! Biden‚Äôs camp puts out lies! When will their accounts be suspended?
Well if you go after Trump, Clinton &amp; Obama get pulled in. We need to distance ourselves from the old Soviet bloc due to Biden...very slippery slope! DC is one big crooked ass group of folks no matter the side of the fence...they have more money then ANYONE lol
Biden doesn‚Äôt speak in complete, coherent sentences ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but you think he would make a good president?!?
I‚Äôm not saying they are great. I know that Obama was the Deporter in chief. I‚Äôm just saying that trump truly just wants us out of here sooner than Obama/Biden ever did. And if you are happy with this 4 yr and how trump does business then, I guess you deserve trump as a president.
I know...it does! We are all worried about what he is going to pull!! I surely hope Biden has a plan!!!!
real transformational change requires transactional &amp; strategic leadership, mistakes will happen swiftly to garner continued improvement! Is my life significantly better because  ABSOLUTELY!  Is yours....ABSOLUTELY!  You really think Biden is the best option? üò≥
TX have 2 popular Dems  w/strong NATIONAL bases. One was in Obama‚Äôs Cabinet. The other,in 2018, received the most votes for a Dem in TX history  How the FUCK could an obscure media created mayor from a town smaller than Trophy Club, can help Biden flip TX?
Biden at 77 years old will be 81 during the ‚Äò24 campaign.  IMHO, he won‚Äôt run for re-election.   Warren at 71 will be 75, at most she would also be a one term successor.    Harris &amp; Rice are both 55, each has an easy 12 years in front of them.   #1 Harris #2 Rice
Bernie hasn‚Äôt ‚Äòcheated‚Äô on anyone. He ran a strong campaign, but SC and the American voter decided that getting rid of Trump was more likely with Biden as the nominee. Everything we hate about the Demstablishment is way way worse under Trump, so, we prioritize. That‚Äôs real life..
Y‚Äôall gonna flip shit when you learn that Obama, Bush, Clinton, Pence, Biden, and Trump are all on the same team.
dear dr Biden,  please remind mr Biden although he has got our votes in order to get more votes he should speak slower, clear and with an emphasize on his key points!!! Like a leader...Thank you mam!!
Mr Biden although you got my vote, however, please note when speaking, do so like a leader meaning do speak sports fast and emphasize words that you like to be making a point of...thank you sir!
I do the same thing.  Unless it's funny and AOC or Biden open their trap and I need a laugh.
Wait and see...if Biden gets elected, all of a sudden, HCQ will become a ‚Äúwait it does work!‚Äù drug and Covid will be gone by February.
If Trump wins again, Covid will continue to last ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù, but if Biden wins, Covid will disappear around Feb 2021 right after Biden takes office.
Depends. It Trump wins, Covid continues...if Biden wins, *poof* it magically goes away and we‚Äôve found a cure around February if he takes office.

Please ask  if he will be helping Joe Biden with debate prep, or if he has been supplanted by Alec Baldwin. :-)
Joe Biden's $2 Trillion Green New Deal Is Just a Worn-Out Democratic Job...  via
Biden is a very very weak Presidental candidate
Of course Talib will not endorse Biden. She needs Confederate Caligula and Trumpfederates in the media to keep her useless ass relevant  Talib is the nastiest, the most intolerable, bitter, and useless  of Squadders. She‚Äôs like the üëáüèæ of (AOC)Josie and the Pussycats
What makes the media so fucking egregious is that they use Kamala &amp; Beto as shitstools and an ‚Äúexample‚Äù to promote two of the most overrated racially insensitive frauds in the party  And they won‚Äôt stop until Warrigieg split DNA to become Evita and Juan
She was supposed to show remorse for her remarks in the debate? She was practically angelic compared to other attack dogs in debates. Experienced politicians know all's fair in this game. Warren was at least as aggressive as Harris. Biden gets it. This is a non-story.
NFL is back baby MLB postpone game tonight Donald Trump reelection Joe Biden hiding in basement Tommy Tuberville wins Senate Alabama and final take on Cumno
What if Biden and the liberals don‚Äôt accept 2020 election results?
A "Biden blowout-" you mean an explosion in his basement?  That's the only kind of blowout he's gonna get!  PS- aren't you supposed to be masquerading as a "conservative?" FAIL!
FYI Spotify didn‚Äôt recognize the link.  It I searched Women for Biden on Spotify and found this and another playlist. üòä
They're working together. Trump was necessary to advance goals quickly before the 70-90 year old Zionist boomer crowd with all the money and political clout dies off. Biden isna bigger Zionist than Trump, he's made Christian congressmen calling themselves "Zionist" a whole thing.
I would swap out Demings for VP and Harris as AG. Def Warren at HHS. Agnostic on Rice. Since you asked. But Biden doesn‚Äôt listen to me so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
Biden would piss his pants in the first 5 minutes!
My husband, the devout conservative Repiblican who voted for Trump, says ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù. And I‚Äôll take it.
Joe Biden can‚Äôt even read what‚Äôs on paper in front of him.
Biden will not be President.
Please name one thing Joe Biden has done to improve America in 49 years,. waiting.  Have you seen the videos of Biden sniffing young girls? look at his children. What kind of person raises scum like that? Any opportunity to sell and influence another person is golden why pass up?
And if you vote for Biden, then you are a traitor and hate America. By the way I am voting for President Trump, and I am not a racist.
Keeping the crazy in the family. What is it about Biden you support? all his racists statements? his sniffing young girls? the way he's raised his sons -- creepy perverts like ol' Joe.  Please point to something positive other than the D behind his name.
Bigfoot is real, but Biden for President lawn signs are mythological!
I understand, but I think that works both ways. There are some secret Biden voters that are GOP who don't want their GOP family and friends to know that they are NOT voting for CORRUPT RACIST TRUMP!!
Yeah like Biden would be an upgrade.  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No mention of beating trump or pulling votes away from him. I have no way of processing this other than that he only wants to beat Biden or doesn‚Äôt realize the primaries are over. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I agree that we need better candidates to be nominated to become president sir. But not voting at all is simply a vote for Trump. It‚Äôs sad that we got to choose between two evils to run this country. Unfortunately Biden is the lesser one.

Yes I'm voting for Biden!

Can you please be VP for Biden  because love where you stand on your issue going on United States please and thank you
101 days you decide Biden or Trump
Plus money yesterday... keep talking that shit... would make you look like Sleepy Joe Biden if we got on a debate stage
As you should, buuuut don‚Äôt get too comfortable, Biden will be calling soon!!! üôèüèΩ thank you üôèüèΩ
Joe Biden was a hero?  No.
Yup, that‚Äôs the hellscape we live in now. And it‚Äôs terrrible. It‚Äôs going to take more than Biden winning, more than a Blue Wave to stop this. A serious cultural change is needed.
Treasonous Tiberius accepted donations, including the ELECTION, from Russia, but you don‚Äôt hear Nicolle Wallace using unemployed civilian, HRC, as shitxample to ask Biden a ridiculous bullshit question  And if you are going to orgasm out Beto‚Äôs name, at least pronounce it right
I sure hope the Biden campaign hook  up for all these awesome videos he is tweeting out. Love this!

Did you not read the article or see the news story? Rosenstein‚Äôs testimony confirmed it. That was a complete fabrication made up. Obama and Biden will have to testify. Mueller now HAS to call them to the carpet. They LIED. There was no Russian collusion. It‚Äôs OVER. #Trump2020
battles.  9. Always remember, cable media doesn‚Äôt know what the fuck they are talking about. Especially about black voters.  10. Donate &amp; volunteer for down ballots. We need more than Biden. We need local, state, House, &amp; Senate to escape the 30% holding us hostage
thing to say), and not welcome ANY opportunity for Little Elm Community Theatre theatrics on the House Floor, then I have levees to sell you. Anytime a Trumpfederate attacks AOC, a Dem gets a wing.  8. If Biden asks Norman Bates to speak at the convention, let him. Going /6
Outside of Twitter and national media, not many care who Biden picks for VP. His pick will not make much of a difference now. It may in 2022 and 2024, though
Biden is in a perfect position in the polls to pick someone he is comfortable and confident she is ready to take the wheel   Harris, Rice, or Duckworth  I would add Warren but her hypocritical faux feminist, self entitled cult would fuck this up for Dems
Biden (his island is next to Epstein‚Äôs) and Bill Clinton.
Pence and Biden

I think Trump is doing go job on going Fox News but Biden need go on other network like Fox News Sunday getting interviews with Chris Wallace please
I to my colleague on the right are we still friends if I vote for Biden but doesn't mean he going to win because having done a debate
Watching  shut it down on #Maddow.  I am strongly against ‚ÄúVP MUST be a WOC‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúVP HAPPENS to be a WOC.‚Äù However, it makes sense if Biden chooses a Red State Dem as VP: to flip, give confidence to LARGE fraction Dems take for granted,&amp; win Red State leftists
What BULLSHIT! MSNBC IS A SHAM ORGANIZATION!  AMERICA WILL NEVER surrender to liberal anarchist!  I SUPPORT TRUMP üíØ!  Send in the troops NOW!  The law RULES! BIDEN SUCKS!
I‚Äôm not surprised or worried about Biden. It‚Äôs not complacency saying he‚Äôs got this. Even if he picks Cersei Lannister as VP  But we need to win that Senate &amp; get Tyrant Turtle out of there. Also allow Human Phoenix RBG retire in peace Let‚Äôs do our best to win red states in reach

So you are a mind reader? I guarantee I don't want low income housing in the middle of my development. Has nothing to do with race. We have people of all ethnicities living here. The policy as defined by Obama admin is bad policy. Biden will continue to push/expand it.
I know some really sharp 77 year old's, but Biden is not one of them.
Y'all, Biden may not be the *best* option in November but he is our ONLY option unless you want to live through more of this for 4 more years. Register &amp; vote.üîµüîµüîµüîµ

This isn't Biden or Trump's America. It's our America and we need to fix it now. This is unacceptable in every way.
Just keep in mind people Biden is NOT Obama! He was the clown sitting in the corner bragging while Obama was President
