Great piece, but they won't lockdown.  We are the States. The United part is an illusion, thanks to Trump/GOP greed, contempt for fellow citizens (even their "base") and malice toward governance. Our civil war is now biological. Hopefully, our democracy will not die of COVID.
No. That’s the Trump base that’s insane. And uneducated ignorant voters.

Trump in a landslide
But who's the one that said "if you vote for Trump, you're not black" wasn't that Joe Biden the racist motherfuker?  #Trump2020 #VoteOutRacism
We need the DNC to stop screwing over decent candidates to push their narrative simply because they know their supporters hate trump enough to vote for literal Satan to take his place.  I've yet to have a presidential candidate I've felt good about voting for in my lifetime.
I think trump will win re-election and I think it will be one step closer to me killing myself
Total propaganda to make the majority of Trump supporters feel good about themselves.
Guys, I heard Trump is going to fight to help women get the vote, and make committing a murder punishable by law!
Wait... Trump owns expensive country clubs?   Why didn’t you guys report on this before? Lol  We would have never voted for him... hahaha
I hate seeing the racist usage of calling it a countries name virus. It's not the China virus. It was from there. Who cares. It is how you deal with it in life. The way Trump fans handle this I will call it the COCK Virus. Conservative Oblivious Caucasian Klan Virus #COCKVirus
Honestly speaking, Laura Ingraham is a seriously sick woman.  Laura and Trump are on the same page, they believe COVID-19 is not harmful and is going to be magically disappear, despite thousands continue to die everyday
Trump spoke the truth.
One of these is Joe Biden. The other is the mumblings of a blithering idiot.  Everyone in Trump world should be doing everything they can to keep trump quiet until Nov 3rd🤣
90 days out.  They’re making their run to silence people.  Imagine skimming a “few” at a time from millions of Americans who plant to vote for Trump.   Say diminish their influence by 10-20%???
As we quickly approach 165,000 deaths I want to say FUCK YOU to the  62,979,879 people who voted for trump and to every single Republican Politician In This Country  Allowing this pandemic to sweep across our country is an Act Of Domestic Terrorism. The callousness of say that
Im  the hospital right now &amp; just found out that Trump announced he's covering my pre-existing conditions! Thanks SO MUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP 4 BEING THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER 2 DO THIS FOR OUR COUNTRY! #MAGA
Very bold of Trump to reinstate “Obamacare.”
If tea Israel interferes, even if India loses in US elections, Trump is not the only one who dares to fight against Iran and China.
TRUMP IS USEFUL IDIOT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND THE RUSSIANS, THAT'S WHY  RUSSIA IS TRYING TO BOOST TRUMP'S CANDIDACY.
Y’all dumb asf if y’all voting for trump just because he’s extending the unemployment benefits. That’s exactly what he’s preying on. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Worse: He’s sucked up to Trump and kissed his ass so much that he’s starting to look like one of his sons.
Trump is a very sick man.
Seriously: please share #TrumpBoomerangCon and/or #TrumpBoomerang. It’s all this grifting jackass knows to do to try to erase the history of Obama &amp; others who actually gave a damn about us &amp; knew what the fuck they were doing.  Tell Trump to shove it w/ his scams.
I bet it just breaks his heart too.  Get ready for 4 more years of Trump.
As pandemic relief talks fail, Trump readies executive actions - The Washington Post
much of the blame does indeed fall on trump, but the structural deficiencies in american society (i.e. capitalism) are ultimately responsible
Yeah, the ACA already covers this, meaning that Trump has been trying to get rid of something and then put the exact same thing back in and try to take credit for it...again. #TrumpBoomerangCon #TrumpBoomerang

I know your FOS because if that were remotely true you would be a Trump / Republican supporter
Even our own intelligence is biased!
I don’t understand why people are so confident Trump is going to be defeated
Hell ya! This is perfect. He's just ignoring all of those things and not fixing them!  Not gonna touch this guy!  4 more years!
Can’t blame mental health on this this is with intent so trump can win mr west is a bastard and a traitor to his own people for this one and the community as a whole united should give him our backs for the rest of his time on earth
The 3 amigos have shown us time and time again that they are COWARDS with zero INTEGRITY and will continue to support Trump even if he kills another 160k Americans. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry

First it was buildings. Then it was golf courses. Now Trump is trying to put his name on Obamacare. JFC
I’m gonna say NH is tilt GOP, a popular republican governor and the fact trump lost that state by less than 3,000 votes gives me hope it flips gop.

That's a tough one. I've been pondering this question a lot recently. I think they're both damaging, but in somewhat different ways. Trump seems like the more immediate danger, but Biden represents the potential for the liberal capitalist economic order to further entrench itself
Almost like when he says that person “is a very good person“ in .trump speak means, I will fire him in 48 hours

Geraldo is just like Trump film flam man. Remember Al Capone’s fault?
Why dont you form your own opinion instead of piggy backing off every single thing your commander in chief decides to do. This scares me because if joe gets elected what are you going to talk about? Like your career is done if trump isnt president. Lmao you have no content.
I have literally never seen somebody so obsessed and career dependent upon mocking one man. I wonder who your audience even is because nobody I know ever even mentions you. Your jokes flat out suck. You just mock trump all day long. At a certain point you just shake your head...
Thank you!

Right.  I see folks talking about the cost of Obamacare, but we shouldn't forget it was Trump who's elimination of the minimum annual fee of $75 caused lots of younger healthier participants to exit and drove costs for others u p.
Seems like this should be getting at least as much attention as sports &amp; Trump today, right? #ohshit #ClimateChange
It goes without saying at this point, but Trump is a fucking moron.
I'm so excited(!) for Trump's upcoming executive orders creating penicillin. And cheese fries #Obamacare

At the Trump presser, the muthafucka suddenly sent to hand out masks WASN'T WEARING A MASK! So each elite, rich, white Trump club member could be infected as they accepted a mask. This is insane cult behavior.
I know what you mean. I'm terrified as well. There's so much about the Trump cultists that is terrifying. The complete lack of critical thinking, the violence, the racism, so many things
Lord, how I LOVE my PRESIDENT! TRUMP 2020!
Maybe Trump could give free rooms to evicted people since he has such a big heart and really cares about Americans.  LOL!!! Like that orange piece of shot gives a fuck about anyone but himself.  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Falsehoods and Failures: Trump During COVID-19 (8/7 Update)

I have yet to see a Trump sign in the wild, but I live in a pretty liberal area. I have only seen 2 Biden signs though, in addition to the one in my yard. Get on it peeps!

this Ohioan wishes there had been a follow up for  when he claimed the divisive, racist. incompetence of trump (and the death of 160,000 Americans from Covid) was worth it because of some judges.
President Trump says he'll sign an executive order on payroll taxes, student loans, and unemployment -- but the order remains questionable on how it will be funded without Congressional authorization.
Trump went to play golf expecting congress to get a deal done...they didn’t so now he has to do a press conference from his golf club...this is the same guy that said he’d be too busy to golf...yet here he is. Another weekend, another few rounds, another grift...

"I was really concerned when she came back from school saying Trump isn't a Christian. This isn't the kind of thing I'm paying Jerry Falwell Jr. for"
So this must be what it feels like to be the battlefield in someone else’s proxy war.
I just started paying attention to politics more closely with Trump cause the shit is just mind blowing and it's all just a farce. It just is not close to the system that we're taught in school
You don’t say, I can’t imagine why!
I tend to agree but would rather they have courage and stand up against the Trump party and represent the Republican Party with dignity
Like The Russians, the NRA owns Trump. Oh, wait, that was redundant
Trump is late to his own press conference that he told everyone about not even an hour before it started. I wonder why?🤔🤔

This is a list of peoples Donald Trump would like to get rid of
Very few people “rise to occasions.”  It was knowable that Trump would not. Trump sets the pattern for his administration.
Doesn’t work.  Trump says he doesn’t believe it, and had acknowledged never pressing Vlad about it.

Trump is cosmopolitan. He's tried McDonalds in every country he's visited. Even #Thighland.
Except Biden won't accept any assistance, and Trump will. So ... it will be Biden vs Russia.
I thought this was an interesting take from an alumnus who would have come shortly after Trump:
Jokes on you Trump... Biden was NEVER worthy of the black vote. Neither candidates are at this point.
The Trump administration will fight release of this information. They don’t want to acknowledge that Russia is again trying to help Trump.

Everything about Trump is antithetical to Christian beliefs. Everything.
They’ve been looking into him for 4 years!  And all they have is the stuff they made up!  Manafort and Cohen and Gates are shady by themselves, nothing to do with Trump or the campaign.  The real criminals are all from the Obama administration.  But you already know this.
Congress is supposed to work together on a bill. House has passed their side, Senate should be negotiating with House. Final goes to Trump. GOP is politicizing this entire thing at the expense of those needing relief from virus economically.

Let’s talk-I don’t support trump 100%. Economics, I think he does well. Foreign policy I’d give him a b+. However, his Covid response was garbage. I’m concerned for his mental state due to tweets. Making his decision making questionable. HOWEVER, I don’t trust Biden mentally!
I’ve always loved me some  but, trump made me appreciate/respect him so much more. There is no comparing the two.
Won the war of taking Otto out of the Mrs’ alma mater and sending him to mine.  This is the winning Trump promised.

Thank you
Just wait and see! Already most of this i wrong. And the rest of it is still in the works.  Its amazing what this president has still gotten done plus still working on with no help from most and opposition at every turn!  Good Job Mr Trump  !
Is all you do all day is just wait for him to tweet just to say some stuff that doesn’t make sense? Maybe your a fan of Trump as much as you stalk him. Like jeez go get a life and stop living on Twitter.

It's not a benefit if you can't use it.......  Deferring payroll taxes is dumb. People who lost their job due to Trump's incompetence need money, not a tax cut.

I could think of a couple things that fit the bill of "National Emergency" a lot more than a social media platform. Also, *if* TikTok's side of the story is true, it makes the Trump admin look even more like its looking for a distraction than it already does.

Wrong on both counts, US ranks 10th in deaths/mm, about in the middle of the pack compare to European countries. Trump’s early (Jan 31) China ban saved thousands of lives and since then he has followed the science and deferred to Fauci, Birks and the governors.  Right?

Trump will win by at least what he won by in 2016. He may flip 1 state he lost then, maybe 2. Senate will stay Red but barely . House will be close. If it stays  blue it’s because of mail in voting. Also I don’t think Nancy will remain SOTH.

An incompetent President could not accomplish the things Trump claims Biden will accomplish (in a negative sense). It’s one or the other. Or, does he think Reps are so weak that even an incompetent Dem could do anything he wants? It doesn’t make sense. Maybe it’s not supposed to.
Trump is trying to simultaneously maintain that Biden is too senile and incompetent to be President, and that he was will be successful in implementing his ‘dastardly schemes’ that he will erase religion, guns, police, and prosperity from the US. It’s nonsense.

In Putin’s back pocket right next to you and trump.
We can demand Facebook, Twitter, print media , tv, radio, etc. stop perpetuating trump’s lies.
People are worried about pedophiles among a hundred other issues. The fact that Trump continues to be involved in illegal activities with no repercussions as of yet, is something everyone should be concerned with. He's not above the law.
Just heard some WH flunkie flunkie say that Trump is the “working class president.” WTF???????  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Trump's ad men are masters of the self-own. Trump looks like an ignorant, preening buffoon while Biden is shown as a serious,  thoughtful, and devout man. This is as bad as their ads trying to scare you about "Biden's America" using pictures of Trump's actual America.
The only person I have blocked is Trump, and that was for my own personal well-being.
Meanwhile, Facebook has deleted a post by President Donald Trump for the first time, saying it violated its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.
The disclosure on Wednesday was rare for the Trump administration, which has been cautious about blaming the Kremlin for disinformation campaigns, especially around the U.S. election.
Yeah, I'm not sure Dems are really extremely concerned about a state Trump won by 10 points.
Right? In what world is anybody, Dems definitely included, saying that Iowa will for sure go to Dems? Honestly, I'd Iowa is even this close, that's bad news for Trump and even the GOP held Senate.
Can you believe an inexpensive MASK can amplify speech and translate into EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES!!!  Do you think it could make Trump speak the truth?
This is the first time that Facebook has removed a post from Trump entirely.

Exactly.  Thank God that judges have more integrity than Trump, his cronies and appointees.  They ARE the law.  They should have NO political influence.  I'm so sick of these "conservatives" that have no moral compass.

Cool. If that's true, I'd love to know that as well. I'd also liked to know why Trump or Alan Dershowitz hung out with him and why Trump is on team Maxwell. Let's get it all out.
My mom blocked her eye doctor’s wife on fb for being a trump supporter. And today she waited an hour at her eye appointment with no one else in the waiting room. Small town drama is something else.
I'm not the one unwilling to point out flaws in my dear leader. Talk about brainwashed. As for Clinton, he's Trump without a Twitter account. Same terrible policy positions (3rd way is trash politics) and same sexual proclivities. Two sides of the same corrupt coin.
You mentioned Trump and Maxwell? Because you should.
Trump was friends with Epstein and wishes Maxwell well in her prosecution.

I do not intend to imply whether the supposed advances for the gay and lesbian communities are good or bad. I am merely analyzing the political strategy behind this quote which is supposedly meant to engender support for Trump over against Biden.
Setting aside the accuracy of this claim for a moment, I find this tactic very curious. Most of Trump’s voter base would not consider this a selling point. Certainly not Evangelicals. It seems the Trump campaign has more to lose than gain here. Am I wrong?

Of course. His candidacy is a fraud. He won’t be on the ballot in enough states to win even 100 electoral votes.  The only purpose his candidacy serves is to play spoiler for Trump in specific key states.
...which now his campaign appears to be making Biden seem weak by photoshopping out pictures of him worshipping the same God written in that Bible.   Trump is the real fake news.
The funniest part about this is where was Trump when protesters where at his door demanding justice for black lives across the country? ....hiding in his basement.....   Then he proceeded to tear gas folks so he could take a picture with a Bible in front of a church....
this perplexes me so much... why are you demanding that trump wield powers he does not and no one wants him to have including his own supporters.

"Florida's Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot &amp; Vote by Mail!"
Watching Trump and Biden debate is gonna be like listening to a Google Home and Amazon Echo talk to each other.
Open schools but no vote-by-mail (unless the state would benefit Trump). Mail is unreliable, but Trump is in charge of USPS and mail has become less reliable when needed most.  Covid is no big deal but is also germ-warfare by China!  Blatant hypocrisy is cheered by Trumpers. Sad.
Almost guaranteed that Biden will win this (especially if he stays underground and doesn't speak out of his dumb little mouth) because Trump has been such a disaster during coronavirus   but that doesn't change the fact that Biden sucks, Biden is abysmal, Biden is terrible
Presidents typically seek to hold their nominating conventions in a state seen as crucial to their chances of winning the election, but this year's coronavirus outbreak has forced candidates to drastically change the way they campaign.

Who knows with Trump. Smh 🤦‍♀️
I come from an area swarming with Trump supporters, they even have a billboard. I can't even make sense of their logic. They act like he is god and that it is all "fake news". How do you deny the stupidity in this video? This man is unfit for any political or leadership position.
First of all the media riding your ass over every decision is part of the gig. 2) trump is &amp; has always been antagonistic to them &amp; brings a lot of the shit on himself (like when he used the sharpie on the storm forecast map because he couldn’t just admit he was wrong
Also while most presidents go to camp David for weekend getaways, where the facilities are more secure &amp; therefore require less secret service, Trump goes to his properties where the taxpayers have to foot the bill for all of it. Remember when USAF pilots were staying at his
Whatever you say. You and your boy trump have a lot in common. You say shit, it’s in print, &amp; you double &amp; triple down saying you didn’t say it, like some sort of half assed Jedi mind trick.
Hey  Trump wants to federalize voting.
if ur enthusiastic about either candidate its because of the other one. that is anti-trump and anti-biden enthusiasm.
if trump tweeted 2+2= 4 the left would claim math was racist..  oh wait they already are.  its just not worth being aggravated by things that politicians say to each-other, they are crazy incompetent morons. let them be and move on from it.
Jsut because trump says something that happens to be generally correct even in the wrong context doesn’t mean it’s wrong
I ignore most of the stuff trump rambles on about. Couldn’t care less. Mailin voting is not a good solution. Acting like idiots over trump pointing that out doesn’t solve anything
I mean most talking points are pretty stupid. Saying mail in voting was bad was not a trump talking point until dems flipped upside down because he was asked about his opinion.
Ur getting hung up on trump. It’s never been a thing cause it’s not reliable and to easy to abuse and takes ages. Fact that trump mentioned it being unsavory when everyone has said that for Decades is irrelevant. Dems just react to him on it now and switched their stance
hi I never voted for Trump actually I voted for Bernie and then bit my tongue and voted for Hillary to keep him out of office but I want to tell you thank you for creating this Twitter these are really interesting to read
Is Trump their President?
I know we've said for five years SNL could just read out the transcript, but Axios may have created a better skit than SNL could. The eyerolls from Swan, the camera movement, Trump shuffling the papers.  This is the leader of the most powerful country on earth. It's surreal.
Perfect illustration of why Trump is unfit for the presidency. He sees the world ONLY through the prism of his narcissism. He despises those who criticize him and is easily manipulated by those who praise him. The concept of morality has no meaning; only his wants are real.
Builder pitched to Trump wins new $289M border wall contract   We don’t want a racist wall  Trump just won’t stop even though most Americans oppose wall  Biden will be able to cancel this  #FreshTweets

19% of the people in America voted for Trump in 2016, so the figure is probably somewhere in that ballpark. Most of us paid attention to the lyrics, too.

The Trump administration is taking steps to give telehealth a broader role under Medicare, with an executive order that serves as a call for Congress to make doctor visits via personal technology a permanent fixture of the program.
There is absolutely going to be NO DIFFERENCE between Trump and Biden in office. I will never vote for either.

Screw Trump he is as disaster.
He isn't donald trump
Can not wait until you debate President Trump
No apology for Trump's inexcusable negligence in avoiding masks for so long?
Trump said he’d take care of that right after he got elected. Since he’s failed so miserably, that’s just one more reason to vote him out in November.
Trump is only serious about this if he's guaranteed a cut under the table.

While Congressional Democrats, Senate Republicans and the White House are largely in agreement on the need for a stimulus, agreeing to a framework remains in question.
Shouldn't you include the information that Trump can't legally do that? Or do you consider your job done once you repeat his lies?
I don’t like to talk, but my goodness why doesn’t Trump just fire everyone and do it ALL himself. He’s muzzled Anthony Fauci and he’s trying the same with Deborah Birx!  Everyone will find out how smart he really is!!  Holy sh—, where’s the Tylenol?
How the Trump campaign came to court QAnon, the online conspiracy movement identified by the FBI as a violent threat
Well this could work out good. If it takes a couple of years to get the results President Trump will stay President until the end of the count/results and then get 4 more years.
....actually....  It is 240 weeks since Trump promised his health plan - January 2016 was the first reference I can find.  #TrumpHasNoPlan
what does that have to do with denying sciences. trumps repsonse to covid hasnt been good, but the left was complaining abotu trump doing anything into march and were wrong too. and have been wrong most of the time as well.
ya, more LGBT people like trump than have ever liked bernie.
i didnt vote for trump but the left beating a dead horse like this makes them pretty unpalatable.

Good Trump
Republicans big issue is fiscal responsibility—its why I switched political parties.  The reality—it’s not a real issue for them—how do I know?  Bush.  Trump.  Shame on me for believing the GOP.  (No I didn’t vote trump—I’m not dumb.)
We all know TikTok isn’t at risk of being banned because of surveillance. Trump doesn’t care about it any more than tech reporters do, and the American public cares even less when their own government has been doing the same thing to them for years
He’s going to lose it on national TV because of the news that Trump org. Is being investigated for fraud
President Donald Trump said he's set a deadline of "around" Sept. 15 for TikTok's parent company to sell the rights to its U.S. business, and suggested that the sale include a payment to the U.S. Treasury.
D.A. Is Investigating Trump and His Company Over Fraud, Filing Suggests
I pray that’s true. However, if it comes out that any of them knew what was going on (which is evident in the case of Bill and Alan) or were partaking, they need to be brought down. I’m a Trump supporter, but even ignoring this going on is a deal breaker.
They only report what Trump says or does. There’s no need to lie about anything; he does enough of that for everyone. But if I’m wrong please tell me what they lie about?  I don’t mind waiting.
I have not been to church in quite a long time. But when I did go each minister of the churches I attended were Christians. Real Christians. Then I realized that it’s not Christ your sect has been worshiping. After all you’re as much a Christian as Jim Jones (or Trump) was/is.
I saw where a breeze blew trump's wall down and opened the border.
I just told someone w a Trump mask to have a good day.... that’s my good deed for the week, I’m tired.
What I've learned out of it is that trump has full manipulative power over the minds of both his lovers and haters, and can easily make either believe anything he wants by either saying the thing or the opposite thing,
No, there are no “Biden supporters”, but there ARE “Trump haters” who, while voting against our President will be supporting Biden with their votes.  I can’t think of a worse way to approach an election - voting AGAINST  something you have been ‘brainwashed’ into hating.
The Republican Senators will twiddle their thumbs while Trump corrupts our democracy and kills thousands more. This madness must stop!

Such a dumb ass thing to do regardless of how you feel about Kaep.  If he had a Trump wig on, or was wearing a Biden mask, still a dumb ass thing to do.
Yeah but I had a hard time imagining President Trump too.
This is rich. Perhaps if the federal government, headed by WSJ Opinion section hero Trump, had instituted a national plan + response, worked with state + local leaders to impose a fact- and science-based approach, we would be heading into fall more like South Korea. Spare us.
Lol. The best analogy I’ve come across is: “Watching Trump speak is like watching a child give a book report on a book they have never read.”
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton’s ex-WH spokesman says
I love how whenever something misspelled is trending on twitter it can be reasonably assumed it was Trump

I'm trying to parse the clown logic that the government is hiding the truth about hydroxychloroquine, while simultaneously the biggest proponent of hydroxychloroquine is the US president. Who is hiding what from whom? Is Trump hiding the truth from himself?
Maybe the fact that yours have been called by your people “alternative” facts? Or the fact that your so called facts come from sources like breitbart, and “Qanon” funny how trump is always saying anonymous sources are shut &amp; not trustworthy but you guys believe Q wholeheartedly
I hope Trump catches Corona virus and dies alone on a ventilator and I’m not sorry.

I'm in favor of voting by mail, but wary of it this year because of what Trump's new Postmaster General is doing to the Post Office right now.
I do not care about Hillary, she ran worse campaign ever and deserved to lose, that does not mean a lying Oompa Loompa should be President that has no idea how the Government works. And Hell I would vote for Andy Green over Trump and he is a Republican
Like I said I’m my post... you can be of a religion or even raised in a religion and not agree with everything it teaches. And at the end of the day the man said he was Christian &amp; acted a hell of a lot more Christian in terms of how he treated his fellow man than trump so who
Sexual assault (forcing yourself on women) was ok. And he never alienated half the country at least not purposely the way trump has so while you question HIS Christian bonifieds I say if it looks, sounds, &amp; talks like a duck it’s probably &amp; if it cheats, talks, &amp; acts unchristian
Very Nice , We are you in Concord Mass from KY very hard to find trump Supporters.
Let me give it to you this way Andy Green sucked as a Manager for three years with the Padres, you guys did not give him three more years! Why should we give Trump another chance? #VoteTrumpOut
Brilliant idea of what to do with an unsolicited gift of a MAGA hat by a neighbor. I’m that obnoxious neighbor that already has a skeleton sitting on my balcony. If my neighbors put out any Trump signs this year, totally doing this. 💀
Trump=Drama...... I mean if ever there were a #dramaqueen it's  ...it's always about him, and "poor lil ole me"  or "Look at what I made."  I taught early start last year and those kids weren't nearly as whiny
Trump is that America alone will never survive. WE DO NEED ALLIES. This country got rid of segregation over 60 years ago. But this America first stuff at least the way he presents it &amp; a good # of his people take it is going back that direction. Just my 2 cents
if there is a national security risk, which alot of people (not pro trump) think there is, then yea he could. the bigger question is why apple and google dont seem to care.

Voted for President Trump
we learned this lesson with Trump, electoral accelerationism just isn't a good framework to view politics through
Voted for President TrumpTrump isn’t their President. If there was a life long politician in the White House, this would be on the same level as the flu in the US.
Actually it's too expensive. The deductibles render it useless for people like me. At least with Trump I am not fined for buying useless insurance. If you need any test or MRI you have to pay $5000 every yr before they will a percentage. My house only cost $10,000.
Good. Its about time someone calls out the media for lies and for pushing agendas instead of reporting actual news. Theres so much going on in the world and all the media covers is CV, Trump and protesting. Pathetic.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are both rapists and pedophiles. But sure, He GoEs To ChUrCh. Tf outta here, neither of them are religious like they claim. We are a melting pot, you people need to get off your Christianity high horse.
What is pathetic Cochran, you could not get to work on time and when you did, all you did on WGN Radio is blast Trump, not take calls from listeners, so you blew a $1,000,000.00 a year PLUS job! Your wife I am sure is proud!

I'm confused. Is  now a supporter of #obamacare "Trump says he plans on making insurers cover pre-existing conditions — a protection which already exists under Obamacare"
It reminds me when bugs bunny tales the Kangaroo to batten down the hatches, The kangaroo says I already did batten them down, Bugs says well batten then down again. This is what trumps executive order sounds like. Trying to make a law or law already exist. Typical Trump #idiot
But ex trumpets who don’t want to vote for a democratic will vote for him. He’ll take votes from tRump 🤣🤣🤣
This negotiating strategy reminds me of the way Trump negotiated with Kim Jong Un.
I’m one of many too scared to change their plan due to circus acts like this. Couldn’t stomach it under ACA dare not under trump. Someone is always waiting to pull the rug out from under us. And to think what $$ we’ve put into it. Sick.
Why are politicians coming out the woodworks to condemn WAP but haven’t shown this much condemnation for Trump’s response to COVID or passed laws against police brutality. This is why America is what it is. Politicians with their priorities all messed up.
I’m just learning that a possible bait/switch could be in the works. trump is such a narcissist, I don’t think he can handle not winning, by any means necessary. So, maybe he is looking for a way out; health related or something, so he won’t look “bad”.
If you’re a card carrying member of the party of Trump, you’ve sold your soul. If you take feedback as an attack, yep, you’re a Trumpster.
oh yeah. no. family, love, friendships. all have equality. at that point it is the individual relationship that matters and even then some things trump that.
is such a spineless sycophant he won’t even attend negotiations for Americans. He gave up the Senate long ago to Trump. He’s so afraid of a presidential veto he has to have it ok’d first. The Senate can OVERRIDE a veto by 2/3, but you’ll notice he’s NEVER done it.
Trump has never heard of him.
Biden wants your guns. Don't hate trump that much to hand it over. He really wants to take them.
We already have protection for pre existing conditions under Obamacare. Trump is in court trying to take it away. KEEP UP
Imagine the proctor "Mr trump, what are your feelings about the 2nd amendment?"  "Take the guns 1st, due process 2nd" "I banned bump stocks."
Dems demanding more: - testing, so they can push fear-porn and justify closing the economy to hurt Trump - tracing, so they can create address list of Republican mail-in ballots to discard - treatment, with Resmedavir at $3,500 per dose rather than Hydroxychloroquine/zinc for $45

tRump will kill them. 🤢
Yeah, well your Canadian so....
I smell a rat. Trump just did this because it's the most popular feature of ACA. He did this so that there is less public resistance when he tries to kill the rest of the ACA.  In court, or however he can. Gives cover to GOP Senate and SCOTUS too.
Oh that thing already in the ACA that the trump administration is suing trying to get rid of?  You really aren't very smart Boris
From our leaders and now from this Trump guy that he chose to run the    It’s not the workers who are calling for this place to run this way, we want to serve and do the best for the American people. We need more voices on our side

Terrific essay by ⁦ wherein he explains the terrain of a conservatism rooted in a thicker conception of community and society.  (Don’t tell him, but social conservatives have been saying all of this for a mere three hundred years).
We’re in the part of the election cycle where people who were always going to vote for Trump pretend they’d consider Biden if he would just pick the right VP!
I knew someone had been doing something... I had a feeling that close to voting time something had to  come out that an investigation would prove us right all along about the SOB in the WH!
We kinda do need him,Trump is about to send us back to the 50's lol
Yes because no matter what could come up couldn’t ever be worse than what Trump is on a daily basis.

Nobody knows better than Trump that the overwhelming majority of his base is non college educated low information voters. I mean hell even the educated ones will tell you basic English words mean something entirely different than what a dictionary says.
This is amazing, but  has no intention of getting justice for her. He only listens to Mitch, Trump and Barr and they want no part of holding officers accountable. He is an embarrassment to our state and his position.
Biden is a better candidate than Donald Trump .
Trump has said worse lol
Trump reminds me of the article where reporters went into Eastern Ky in 2016 and interviewed people who wanted to keep their insurance under the Affordable Care Act but wanted Trump to get rid of Obamacare. They got quite a shock when they found out it was the same thing.
$1.5 trillion isn't the middle.  $2 trillion is, and they wouldn't be able to agree on it anyway.  Has Trump given up on the FBI building?
Well a vote against Biden is a vote from Trump. Lol
The ACA already does this. And tRump is in court trying to overturn it.  What an idiot he is.
Good Trump. Need more of this.
So.... Obamacare but not signed by a Black guy ?  Trump is desperate to steal everything from Obama’s legacy.

So does Trump's EO only pertain to unemployment benefits or does it address the stimulus checks of $1200 also?
And until public health is vital to Donald tRump, the economy will remain sick.
What’s with this save the children stuff all the trump supporters are all of the sudden pushing?
Definitely Trump's Fault !
Yea you know that’s not what is happening. Republicans are all the sudden pretending to care about debts and deficits again so they can kill any deal and make Trump look like a hero saving the day. But I guess keep doing the political operative spin thing on twitter.
Trump talking about us!
I think #Trump just turned into a Democrat nominee during this press conference
When Donald J Trump got in office, he had to say "What the Hell" has been going on in the oval office?! He's lowered drug prices, and much more. There is no way to spell out all he's done in 1,000 tweets. Drugs, Jobs, Criminal Justice Reform, Opportunity Zones, China, on and on!
Trump EO, Dems won't get their giveaways
Trump and #MoscowMitch refuse to meet in the middle.
But Trump is still denying it
If he’s dumb enough to take AND post a picture like for the public, imagine the kind of private blackmail material Trump/Cohen had on him in 2016 to make him and the other evangelicals fall in line with Trump
He will have his “I Have Sinned,forgive me”speech just like Daddy did. The ? Is will he do it just before the election so  daddy trump can welcome him back to the flock - he is the redeemer right?
Ok so what did trump actually say/ mean ? Sounds like he’s not signing an executive order ?  No details so we’re supposed to guess
Trump is going to single handily destroy Social Security via his payroll tax idea - so if the virus doesn’t kill our senior citizens they’ll starve to death while missing their medications!
160,000+ Americans dead from Covid-19 and  is working on f**king TikTok. So good to have a President focused on the important problems. Thanks Trump voters!

Trump talks about "cities and states that have been in trouble for years of bad management," but neglects to realize that bad management is the fucking President of the United States. Deferring payroll taxes? I'm working. I don't need a deferral, kthx.
It wasn't the numerous scandals and crimes he committed, it was THIS. I really have to wonder how dedicated to anything republicans are.  Teacher’s viral essay shows how Trump’s COVID-19 failures are turning Republicans away from party
No way Joe Biden would have done a better job on the China Virus! Of course we'll never know. These jackass's like Juan Williams act like Joe would have done better. Does anyone truly believe a weak person is better at gettin' things done than a strong person. Is Trump! NO WAY!

I care and then I don't. If he's helping Trump, he's not our friend. Maybe he should stop playing Jesus and get some treatment.
JoeBiden: I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone.
Just like you did,  in 8 yrs VP and the other 35ish years? Yeah right and no thanks Joe. You've been key in establishing the swamp, over your many years. President Trump's done more for us and our great country in 3.5 yrs, than you've done, in over 40. Trump 2020!

I think she’s a better choice, for the republicans than Don Jr. but either will be perfect !  Careful you’re showing your feminine bias. You should have said not another wacky Trump.
Jerry Falwell Jr is an evangelical Christian with the exact same Christian values as Trump!
“It is what it is.”  -Donald Trump
If you aren’t for widespread nuclear power then you need to shut the fuck up about climate change.
Chances Jerry Falwell Jr gets appointed to a Trump Administration position?
The attacks on the Portland court house ended with a day or so of the House Committee meeting where Jim Jordan showed the 8-minute video of violent Antifa.  Soros must have told his minions that effort was counter-productive.  Trump was gaining more voters each day of the riots.
The cowboys ain’t nothing but trump if he ran a football team.
I have been praying that God would expose Jerry Falwell Jr for trading his dial for the (Satanic) GOP Trump lie! Now reduced to nothing more than a MAGAT Trump following NRA gun toting racist and hater! Traded his faith for Trump, I never dreamt God would actually “expose” him!
May God save us all from the Trump Virus!
You dont know what you’re talking about, there is just as much science to prove you wrong! you just want anything to destroy trump since you have absolutely nothing to offer America but hate!

How could you let the Courier Journal call you a Trump Democrat. You’d better explain yourself. Many of your supporters are angry about this.
Amy, I’ve supported you all along, but the Courier Journal article is very disturbing. If you try to identify with Trump you will lose our support and the election. Trump will not win this election.
I believe it was in May? Plenty of time for negotiations to happen before everything expired. Mitch said it was dead on arrival and obviously Trump wants to look like the people's savior when he does sign executive orders. I hope most Americans know this game they are playing.
Trump gets more done in three days on the golf course than Nancy Pelosi has in her Life!
If he doesn’t win we are in big trouble as a country. Go Trump.
A pro Biden Republican makes sense but like you I've never heard of or met a pro Trump Democrat.
The federal government pays 90% of the cost of covering people through the expansion, a much higher matching share than for low-income disabled and elderly people traditionally covered by Medicaid.
You really think he was a “good Christian” before he hooked up with Trump?   You are naive at best. Wake up, he is and was a slime-ball hypocrite, using the school as a cash cow for his lifestyle.
I do know there are plenty of Pro-Biden Republicans though. Don’t personally know of any pro trump democrats. We’ve got better sense.
Twitter Democrats are deleting conservative followers from accounts and have been all damn day. Do something about these dishonest Democrat cheats President Trump because Democrats feel compelled to cheat and  can't win without cheating.
Booker is all class...McGrath is a pro Trump supporter. But fuck mitch so #SettleforAmy
She doesn’t praise Trump. You must be listening to Republican lies.
What is wrong with you? It appears you stand with Russia you’re doing their dirty work for them and giving their talking points against Biden. Republicans have really upset me standing with corrupt, fraudulent trump. It’s a sad situation. Put your country first ! Vote him out
It's interesting how all these Idiot's come out and talk about how Trump blew it on the China Virus! If they had the answer and sat on it, then they have Murder on their hands.  Monday morning quarterbacks.  Pitiful!

I mean tbf it is just not the reasons they think it is. Trump will be the last president of the United States.

Yep, this little poll is about right. 60% Biden, 33% Trump, 7% dunno/who gives a flying fuck?

Thank you Tracey for the pic in your Trump bikini!❤️❤️
They just need the real estate to exist, so they can extract equity out of it when necessary.   This is also what many Russian oligarchs and mobsters did with Trump Tower. They bought a bunch of the condos for cash, Trump asked no questions, and they sat empty for years.
Hey Joy, the reason Trump is always trying 2 keep ppl focused on Lying about Joe Biden taken guns away, is because he's trying to cut SS, med, and Medicaid.  With the rest of his crooked party!!!
I think “disavowed” is a pretty strong word for what Trump said-  “Started speaking very quickly” (FALSE) and  “wasn’t happy” and  “You’d have to ask them.”  He didn’t mention “very fine people” tho, so I guess it’s all good.
And the Trump campaign magically had a statement ready to go along with that “both sides” intel report that just happens to mention a potential Biden VP pick. Seems legit.
Rove is working with Trump to reprise this number. Not again, not ever.
I’m not gonna give them too much credit for their intelligence level either so yeah, we can stand back and watch. Hopefully from a safe distance like maybe a few hundred miles. I have not yet figured out why most bikers are Trump supporters. You talk about two different breeds🤪
And if you need any further proof that both sides Intel article drops with a Trump campaign statement ready to go, the Trump campaign statement just happens to mention a Biden front runner for VP.
Nah. Noose tightening for Obama and Hillary. Don't worry. Trump won't send them to Gitmo.
If only we had a president worthy of the office. My daddy once told me, "Never trust a man who lies". What ever happened to all those promises this president made?
I do like his Trump impressions but that's about as far as it goes for me. The daughter obviously an idiot lol
POST OFFICE !!   You are all dealing with LIVES here - many get meds by mail, voting can be done properly by mail (our ballots took over a week to move 5 miles).  IF there is an FBI or any defense money in there, Trump needs to rejoin the Democratic or Reform Party.
Russia is working to undermine Democrat Joe Biden
Trump won’t let them release election interference stuff unless they do the both sides thing. China has taken Trump to the woodshed and gave Ivanka and Jared a blank check. Please with that Trump campaign BS
Do you ever wonder why problems don't get solved?  Usually it is due to one or more of these: - focusing on the wrong thing - allowing emotion to trump critical thinking - lack of a decision making process  #decisionmaking #criticalthinking
Yep I want turtle man out as well. I am in no way a supporter of McGrath but will vote for her as I'd vote for anything over McConnell.  Just sad that our choices are a Trump enabler and a Trump supporter. YUCK!!

He puts the thoughts that have been swirling inside my head into beautiful paragraphs. This is true of the Biden/Trump race, as well. Biden was not my first pick, but he's the only choice if we are to build a better democracy down the road.
Well today two big things happened: Trump’s rape case was allowed to proceed without executive privilege, and McGahn can be subpoenaed by Congress. Is there more? Looks like things are unraveling.
I’m convinced that behind every Trump supporter, there’s a fetish for foreign women
I think if this was true Trump would be touting it and saying that he ordered Pompeo to do it. Since that hasn’t happened I’m not buying this bullshit.
JoeBiden: Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.  It's time we pick a diff…
Thank you. It is very clear what Trump is doing here.  These are not uncontrollable spasms and such.
He like trump, only loves himself
Please someone explain to me what a Pro Trump Democrat is?
Trump will be re-elected.
Could someone please explain to me what a Pro Trump Democrat is? I dont get it. Sounds like an oxymoron
Here is another one.
Democrats want to help government with relief funds from taxpayers. Trump would rather just help the American people with relief funds from taxpayers.
Buy American? tRump makes over $1 million from store that sells products with foreign, unknown origins
Executive order from Trump might be needed to help the individual American while avoiding local and state government bailouts for their past financial incompetences.
If you have to, would you wait in an 8 hour line to vote Biden in, to get Trump out?
Trump will give the American people a second stimulus whether Democrat lawmakers want to cooperate or not. Democrats want to bailout financially incompetent Mayors and Governors across the country.
Can someone please explain to me what a pro Trump Democrat is? Sounds like an oxymoron
China, if you are listening, release everything you have on trump!!!!
She had big money come in to support her during the primaries over Booker. It sure looks like from the outside looking in they stacked the deck. You either get a Trump enabler in McConnell or a Trump supporter in McGrath
Yeah, jobs numbers are up, they forget to mention that Trump is the CAUSE FOR THE MILLIONS OF LOST JOBS in the months before!! More of his unbelievable incompetence and apathy at “WORK”
I'm pretty sure I read that Fauci &amp; Gates hold patents on the COVID-19 vaccine. I see people blaming all the deaths on Trump, when in actuality they're Fauci's fault.
I'm still trying to figure out what a Pro Trump Democrat is.
According to   everyone can attack Trump 24/7 BUT, Biden must be defended by MSN at ALL times. They know he is the weekest candidate ever and CANT defend himself.
Absolutely! We must all be armed with knowledge in the coming months and years. It will take all our efforts to rebuild what tRump has destroyed.
Who proved your point? Remember how scared he is of Putin, takes up for him at every turn. OMG what’s your nationality, you do have that pained look of a Russian. Trump is his lap dog and you are a joke.
You left out the part where China and Iran desperately want to see Trump lose
The house has passed 230+ pieces of legislation in the last 1.5 years. But the way govt works is legislations needs to be passed by the house, senate and signed by the POTUS.   On the flip side, any thing that Trump and the republicans have passed couldn’t be done w/o the House

Quite frankly Trump is a raving lunatic + the antichrist. His cult is incapable of seeing through his deceptions and lies. In fact, the more you point out how evil Trump is, the more his cult defends him. They will tell you Biden is pro abortion while Trump has paid for abortions

When there was talk about Trump making a plan, the Libs were crying that it was up to the Governer's! Most of the death came from Dems forcing our elderly into infected nursing homes. Once we figured that out, we should have opened the country.
8 years and a day ago, in the last few months of his 1st term, President Obama signed the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 into law  today, in the last few months of his term, Trump-
Do you ever watch Trump speak, have an interview??? Probably not, you all like having someone TELL YOU WHAT TO THINK because you are too lazy and it’s too hard to have to do all that yourself. Your comments indicate you don’t know what you are talking about...as usual
If people dont think Trump can find Thailand on a map, they are crazy.  He knows exactly where that is.
Comment with a link to something like this? My approach is uplifting the existence of progressive people of faith, rather than arguing with conservatives on their own approach to following Jesus.
First clean, bright, articulate Black Man!  Black's are the same!  You ain't Black, if you don't vote for me!   You know, you know, the thing, the thing!  I don't want my kids going into a "Jungle!"  Need an Indian accent!   I'll put Trump against that any day!   Joe Racist! 🇺🇲🦅
We knew all along Deutchse Bank was Trump's kryptonite.  Confirmed when SCOTUS Justice Kennedy stepped down, for no apparent reason.  Just a matter of time before Trump-&gt;DB&lt;-Russian Mob became radioactive.    What we do about it will define us.
Trump is not offering anything that is relevant to closing the wealth gap, providing access to education that provides skills in Trades,STEM,or that can rise home ownership and access to funds for entrepreneurship in Black and Hispanic communities so...
Does anyone need any more proof that Trump is the antichrist? If you're a true Christian you would denounce the false proclaimed prophet. The man who said he was the chosen one. The man who tweeted Wayne Root's words saying the Jewish people love him like the second coming of God
An interesting and thoughtful article, worth reading the whole thing if you're interested in the subject matter.  The Polling Is Imperfect, but It’s Bad News for Trump
NEW:  are tip-toeing around President #Trump as their political dangers grow ahead of the November 3 election.
Because electing Trump and or Biden is also Foolish.  So how are you surprised that anyone would vote Kanye??
I’m not too dumb to see anything. Donald Trump is just greatness.
Twitter is a very small place. According to twitter trump had no chance in 2016. People just talk on here lol and support or cancel People when its cool
Donald Trump was predestined to be the greatest president that he is. God bless
Fact check: Biden wants to get rid of automatic weapons and better gun control policies. Trump is the president and has suppressed the 1st amendment. Trump is a pedophile.
I've been saying it for a bit now but Trump is absolutely going to do better with minority voters than he did in 2016.
“For this president to call himself pro-life, and for anybody to back him because of claims of being pro-life, is almost willful ignorance. He is so much anti-life because he is only concerned about himself,” said Bishop John Stowe of Lexington, KY
Keep eviscerating Trump’s stooges.
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR ANY TRUMP TO BE TALKING YIIIIII
Yet we are entertaining Trump and Biden???
Trump and everyone involved in this international crime syndicate needs to be prosecuted and held to account for selling out their country.
No way. No how. Getting rid of Trump will not solve the rot and corruption that has been in the making for at least 40 years. Trump is merely a symptom. He is mentally ill and being used by Putin and the Republicans at the top.
Trump said; "#BIDEN IS GOING TO HURT GOD!" It's time to remove this nut job from office #25thAmendment.
Is this really the best use of our Presidents time? With all that's going on related to #COVID19 Yes, normal leaders can multitask but not  Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days
It has nothing to do with national security which is down the tubes anyway because of Cheetohead. This is all about Trump's reelection. I LOVE TikTok, it keeps me in touch with people and I see the real news live from the phones of TikTok-era. Has he blamed Obama for it yet?
I’ve been encouraged by  approach to faith outreach so far.   They’ve stressed the diversity of faith groups and not exclusively seen religious outreach as catering to conservative Christians.   This counter punch to Trump shows they’re willing to contest the God game.
I’m pretty sure he said he was going to have to vote for Trump when Biden was nominated.
“My faith teaches me to walk humbly, while President Trump teargassed peaceful protestors so he could walk over to a church for a photo op.”   Read  entire statement of faith here:
uses Trump’s illness. Now Trump campaign uses Kanye’s illness   The GOP Circle of Life.
I'm pretty sure this response doubles as Trump's healthcare plan.
Question. Does Trump think his super long neck ties hide his gut? Answer: No it doesn’t we see your fat belly and man boobs in you golf attire. We also see the stains on the back of your white golf pants, maybe buy better depends or put a toilet on your golf cart
Well, the Trump admin is more likely to employ these tactics so you are right to a degree.  Criminals and crooks will behave like criminals and crooks.
The Republicans controlling the WH and Senate have chained themselves to the canard that forcing people back to work by denying them support will bring the economy back thereby helping Trump, and themselves, to get re-elected. Odd idea given that dead people cannot vote.
Between Biden stridently opposing his own church's teaching on social issues and Trump saying Biden will "hurt God" (along with numerous other agitprop inanities) both are extraordinarily disqualified from being standard-bearers for the Christian faith.
Not an apology! That's called damage control and clearly wasn't written by him.  The man doesn't even know how to work text let alone the Twitters.  Trump does say some crazy stuff, but remind me how many decades did Trump spend in politics making empty promises?
So then who pardons Trump when he loses?

JoeBiden: The truth is that President Trump could have acted months ago to curb this pandemic—it's obvious he still hasn’t learned his lesson. He continues to ignore the warnings of health experts and we're all paying the price.

I wrote about this dynamic in late April.  I have to admit being surprised myself at Trump and McConnell’s deliberate delay with an election fast approaching.   Guess McConnell cares more about corporate immunity than control of the Senate? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔🤷🏻‍♂️
Did she just “oh you must want Trump to win” Judy Woodruff?
Im noticing something, most of the trump supporters looks to  be in their 50s or older.
Never Trump means never American.
The crowd’s reaction to Trump’s rhetoric here is very telling.  When he used to defame Hillary, they got fired up.  He’s defaming Biden and “crickets”.
Interesting  column, especially if you read the  piece I tweeted yesterday evening. Venn Diagram intersection seems small, perhaps because Brooks focuses on politicians, Linker on intellectuals. Where Do Republicans Go From Here?
Trump 2020 !!! Let's do this !!!
I love those TRUMP signs!
Trump derangement syndrome is apparently something you can self diagnose.
But never Trump means supporting democrats. RINO
The democrats like biden passed terrible laws like bidens own. Bill that jailed 1,000 black ppl, poor ppl, trump reversed it by executive orders 1,000 were set free and others had harsh sentences reduced thanks President Trump! Fully funded hbcu,he’s done

Anyone who votes for biden is a racist ! I bet anything Biden won’t debate President Trump

Trump organization... suggests they’re most anxious about senator Kamala Harris, that she could chew up and spit out Mike Pence in a debate.
Typical #IMPOTUS self-serving play...  ‘Where the administration is Lucy...the media, investors run up assuming the football is going to be there to be advanced...”
A country’s flag flying upside down is a symbol of danger, a warning that the country is in harms way.  Trump held a bible upside down in the St. John’s photo opp singling to evangelicals that they, if they continue to support this wretch, are likewise in harms way.
“I’ll vote for the guy who’ll permanently wreck the country’s most important institutions because of some transient policy differences.” The scary thing is, there are millions of conservatives like you and your prissy nitpicking is going to re-elect Trump.
How exactly do you hurt a being that you can't touch or see? Hmmm now Trump's trying to get all the Christians outraged to vote against Biden 😂😂 how desperate do you have to be
BANNED | President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered an unspecified ban on “transactions” with the Chinese owners of the consumer apps TikTok and WeChat.

Trump didnt sentence him. He has been in jail for a long time. Hopefully Trump can pardon or commute his sentence. Our justice system is full of all kinds of crazy unfair injustices.
False. But even if so tRump pronounced it differently 2 seconds later, why use in the same sentence? He messed up...don’t die on this hill.  It’s silly, like adultery at a Xtian school or felonious campaign contributions...
I say this as someone who does not want to see Trump stay in office. Maybe it would be best to just stay quiet and not do any live stuff and spend time practicing with a small team to kick Trump’s ass in the debates. Gotta get better that speaking live first.
Go President Trump.  See all those people behind you.  Don’t give up the fight.  I am proud to be an American.
Trump has gone to church once in the last year. By his own admission, he only attends church on Christmas and Easter or special occasions. While Trump is using tax payer money to enrich his golf courses on Sunday, Biden is in church. No Catholic should ever vote for him.
#DSOWD should do a remix of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star / The Alphabet Song.
my own family members and people who use to be my friends until I told them Trump wasn't God. Did the original post get deleted?
Fox News host Ainsley Earhardt asked Trump the other morning, “Mr. President, what is your 2nd-term agenda? What are your top priorities?” his inability to answer was one of the most revealing moments of his reëlection campaign so far.  via
How many messed up and stupid comments about black people does Joe Biden have to make before we start asking ourselves about our other options? We make fun of Donald Trump for the same stupid things but give Biden a pass? Biden is not a step forward but a step to the side.

Trump Signs Executive Order That Will Effectively Ban Use Of TikTok In the U.S.
Donald Trump Jr just appeared to me in a youtube ad and called me a patriot and I feel insulted by him and by youtube for thinking I wanted to see his dumb face
What’s even his point?   That Trump is influenced by Europe?   No American says it any way but Ti-land.  Who care how other countries pronounce it.
Don’t want to sound crazy.   BUT  1) Trump is at war over TikTok, executes unprecedented Exec Order.  2) Facebook and Zuck have recent and deep potential ties w/Trump becoming more exposed.  3) Facebook releases Instagram Reels, a TikTok competitor.  $FSLY $MSFT $FB
No, it was a 13 year old girl tied to s bed that Trump raped.
I asked 30 minutes too early.
Imagine the brightest military minds we have having to hide options from  because they don't trust his stability and reason. The dumbass belongs in a straightjacket.
And cancelling the Jacksonville, FL convention. He said it's out of concern about covid, when has he ever been concerned about covid? Never. A bunch of republican politicians were saying they were not coming. Trump knew it was going to be another Tulsa with no one showing.
Thoughts Jonah on the Excutive Order tonight causing more panic tomorrow?   I am confident a deal will get done and truly believe Trump knows this as well but is trying to spurn it along to get it complete.  More worried it causes more short term butchery.  Stock deserves more.
You're not insane, but if you spend too much time there you might feel that way! That network (Fox "news") is a horrific Pandora's box of toxic hatred and lies. Trump propoganda. UGH!
As I recently wrote, Trump threatened new tariffs against Canada in June.   Featured Research: America First Threatens the Western Security Community

Trump issues executive order banning 'transactions' with TikTok, WeChat owners
Did Trump ever ban TikTok? It's still on my phone and I don't want to get in trouble.
Then you’re voting for Trump.
Over trump, he is the choice of the world.
the fact people say Biden shouldn’t be president bc he “smells kids” (which yes is weird and he should seek help) but then they support Trump who has RAPED children and has ties to sex trafficking makes no sense
That was part of yesterday’s loss. I’m not saying you are going to be wrong here, but I think a lot of this is already baked in. 45 days, I think Trump knows it is happening and just trying to force it to keep moving...
President Trump to ban dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Tell me what it was that i said that lead you to that conclusion? Seems to me you're not looking to be honest but just out looking to propagate anti trump derangement syndrome.
After a 3 hour meeting this evening, White House officials and Democratic leaders are still far apart on some key issues, continuing the standoff on the next coronavirus relief package
THIS IS NOT THE ELECTION TO VOTE OFF-PARTY!!!!!  I don't care what you think re:Biden. Now's not the time for "principled stands". A vote for anyone BUT Biden (or abstaining) is a vote for Trump. Period. Same goes for Mitch. #VoteLikeYourLifeDependsOnIt #BecauseItReallyTrulyDoes
I’d agree with you if he didn’t just come up for air from saying that “you ain’t black” if you vote for Trump. At this point it is clear that he a) takes the black vote for granted; and, b) judges a black person as legitimate or illegitimate based upon whether they vote for him.
He’s adopting disinformation tactics from Trump. Who predicted what for my benefit? ⁦ you are POS and should go fall down some stairs.
I think it'll be the most watched debate in the history of debates. And it'll prove, beyond a shadow of doubt, that trump is a bumbling idiot with no plan and no hope.
Low-Energy Trump

A second #coronavirus test comes back - for  after an earlier one before visit with Trump was + Seems to me this raises some questions about the sort of testing done for those in proximity to POTUS
Unfortunately, Trump may remind him of Mussolini and he may decide Trump is more Italian and thus superior. If this happens take him to the nearest Starbucks to reboot him and re-sync him with the computer on his homeworld.
If Trump or Clinton are guilty, they need to go to prison.
“Laid when I camped in Thighland” Possible Trump Quote
No matter how many times you;  - backslap yourself by asking bad rhetorical questions  - discover hypocrisy  - engage in magical thinking asking Trump and collaborators to resign  - pretend as though there is some hope of reaching “undecided” or “firm” Trump voters  You fail.
Are you all being trite or trying to be cute, or sincerely just not attentive to realize that:  - Trump has a plan - Trump, his administration and Republican Governors have been implementing plan  - Trump and collaborators are achieving the desired results consistent with plan
So Trump is gonna ban TikTok before there’s a face mask mandate across the country where we have had over a million new cases in a just a few weeks. What a joke Trump is.
I'm starting to think that's the point. Maybe they are all Bannonites that just want to burn everything down.  That's clearly what Trump has been doing like.. forever.
If Trump wins in November, I am definitely moving to “THIGH-LAND!” Where you have a “leg up” on all things political! #ThighHighThursday
Donald Trump is a #FakeChristian
It would make my whole decade if at the beginning of their first debate, right after the introductions, During the elbow bump. President Trump looks Joe Biden right in the eye and says, “C’mon Joe, lets go out back right now and just see if you really can kick my ass!”
FUCK TRUMP NOOOOO IMPEACH TRUMP
My bf is a religion scholar &amp; teaches a lot on historical Jesus bc the KJV is all most Americans know, but its SO different from original scripture. Jesus would protested w BLM &amp; would have considered Trump a scourge on humanity.   is no Christian.  #Biblicalidiot
I don’t think Biden should debate Trump.
Rest of us know there’s only like 20 total black people supporting Trump in the US
I don’t know how anyone in their right mind could vote for trump...  Especially considering he’s a racist, rapist, has ties to sex traffickers, etc
I think many of MAGA know Trump is a failure and not the one they’d like in the position, but when faced with owning a bad choice and confirming to the left that they know he was a mistake, they would rather eat the shit sandwhich and smile before giving us the “satisfaction”.
Trump might have been trained in the art of ruthless leadership, but thank God he's America's ruthless leader. 🇺🇲
Commission rejects President Trump's push to add debate against Biden
The guy that Tear-gassed peaceful protesters and threw priests out of their own church to stage a photo op says that BIDEN is the one that will "hurt" the bible.  Trump claims Biden will somehow 'hurt the Bible, hurt God' if elected
I think I'd prefer no debates. Seems like that used to be a way to learn candidate positions but the internet allows us that info now. How is winning a debate important to being a good president? Trump v. Biden debate seems like an exercise in outrage/car crash porn for ratings.
He picked Trump in 2016 ???  Fake news !
I hate to say it Senator, but this isn't new. Started with W, got worse with Obama and and has ballooned with Trump. Fiscal conservatism has been dead for some time
They way trump &amp; Biden are going, we’ll need to vote based on VPs since they’re likely to be in charge by the end of this next term.
This is about showing the hypocrisy of Trump. I think it's a great idea!

That’s always the UK fans “trump card”. Is to tell you about a players draftability like that has anything to do with actual college career/performance. I guess in their minds Skal was a huge success at UK because he was drafted in the first round right?
Why? We ignored Trump's mental capability and look what happened. Biden is in much better shape... He took his SAT's and passed legally.
That would be a great hashtag.  I have many many friends and family who are Republicans and some voted for Trump and some didn't. Most of my friends and family will NOT be voting for him in November and I have heard them echo your statement.  My advice to them was to make it a #.
Mark Zuckerberg will never stop running Trump's misleading #Facebook ads — he makes too much money off of them. That's why federal oversight is essential. Time to investigate and act!

OK, don't give Biden too much shit over his gaff about 'hispanics have all sorts of different issues/priorities, AAs don't'.  In many ways, he is kinda right. For example, the Cubans don't flat out hate trump, but most others do.  The entire AA population of the USA hates trump.
The hangman's noose awaits if Trump stays in office.  Barr and Durham will expose sedition and crimes against humanity on scale that will be hard to understand.  The Pentagon Pedophile task force has been hard at it for over 3 years.  Trump is serious about human trafficking.

What I don't get in terms of strategy is Trump saying Biden is essentially suffered end-stage dementia and can barely speak. He sets the bar so low for Biden's debate performance, that when Biden does just fine, Biden will look like a stable genius. The strategy eludes me.
I'm white give me a good reason to vote for Trump

Fact check: This video was taken in Clyde Ohio before the incompetent handling of the Trump Virus. I'm pretty sure that many people in that crowd are either dead or not voting for Terrible Trump anymore. Anyone who botches a National emergency doesn't deserve to be our president.

Ever since President Trump took office every Republican has been under fire. Democratic run cities and states are going to pot. The Dems let criminals run loose. Only cities that enforce our laws should get federal assistance, not those who have their police stand down.

They are embarrassed to support trump and want to appear concerned about what he is doing. They say they won't vote for him again, but they are obviously looking for an excuse. Biden's VP choice is a deal breaker? Seriously? Just shut up and vote trump. Biden doesn't need you.
That’s so kind of Trump to buy Biden a new plane.
tRump claims Biden is 'against God' and will 'hurt the Bible'
It's one thing that baffles me no matter your political leaning. Is Trump even religious at all?
When Trump fakes like he knows the Bible, he sounds like Clark Griswold giving Aunt Edna's eulogy.
Biden goes to church, Trump plays golf on Sundays!
The governor of Ohio tested positive for #COVID__19 right before a scheduled visit with Trump. 1. I’m sorry that this has happened to him, and I wish him a speedy recovery. 2. For Jesus’ sake, don’t cancel the trip!
If you side with Trump, you are wrong. You are in his 38% cult group. You are just as delusional as your dear leader. People outside of your circle, don’t take you seriously.
The Twilight Zone.          'He'll get us back on our feet': Trump supporters in Kentucky stick by him despite Covid-19 surge
Trump doesn’t go to church. He plays golf on Sunday mornings!!!
😆 Melania doesn’t sleep 🛏 with Trump, they sleep in separate beds.  It might be just a rumor, but I also heard she sleeps on the second floor since she knows Trump experiences difficulty with stairs.
Thigh-land. Yo-Semite. Donald Trump questions Joe Biden’s mind?! Lol. #TrumpDeathToll160K #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TraitorTrump
Trump is projecting onto Biden what is true about his satanic self! Trump is an enemy of God!
OH FFS! They've been investigated! By the FBI, largely due to the Steve Bannon-produced "Clinton Cash!"
Facebook has deleted a post by President Donald Trump for the first time, saying it violated its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.
Will Putin turn over a COVID-19 vaccine to Trump just before November 3?
Thumbing through my Bible, looking for the section where God is pro-guns.  Not sure I can find that...but it doesn't take long to find where Trump attacked a church with guns and tear gas.
Wouldn't it be fun if Biden could time his announcement of his VP to step on Trump's latest effort to be the Total Focus of news cycle.
There's a lot of evidence of Trump's complicity with Russia. He promised us he'd make his taxes public. Has that happened?
Well done response to Trump’s stupid House Of Cards meme
4/ While I grieve their departure from orthodox Christanity, I think there must be more to their departure than than evangelical of Donald Trump.   Being disappointed in the hypocrisy of  leaders and friends is one thing. Rejecting the Gospel message and its ethics are another
Not all of us. I’ve never voted for McConnell even when he was running for local positions. I also never voted for a Trump. He’s an insult to intelligent people.
Idk why you like trump so bad do you not see what’s going on now in 2020 if he had a real plan the situation would’ve been much better
But if they suppprted tRump, it does...
So....trump is a agent of Russia with no proof...proven made up lie and I didn’t feel the outrage from ya there...now an outrageous statement against Biden and here comes the critique...doesn’t seem 50/50 there
Trump’s real superpower is that he never gets tired of his own bullshit.  Any rational person with nominal integrity would eventually wear down under the weight of it.
That statement is the psychiatric definition of projection.  Good grief, Trump is the poster child of projection to the point of being laughable, if not pathetic.  America knows better
Vader definitely a Trump guy.
3/ who reject the historic Christian ethics, taught by Jesus himself, on issues of sexuality, the sanctity of human life, and the totality of how to best love your neighbor.   In their moral reasoning, any support for Trump is written off as syncretism with Christian Nationalism
I just can’t fathom why the Trump campaign would want to make cognitive ability a center piece. The blind narcissism of these people is unreal
Fra-gee-lay. Like Trump's ego!
is the only one in th US who doesn't know Joe is a practicing Catholic.  trump* is a moron  *impeached
Oh yeah Jesus would have been a total fan of Pence and Trump. Especially the putting families in cages, separating children from their parents and making fun of invalids.
Facebook bans ads from pro-Trump PAC
it was not his job (NSC not NSA). he was incoming, as you admit. he was freelancing without any legal authority to do so because trump had not been sworn in. 50USC3021 C&amp;B filed the paperwork AFTER he was busted as an unregistered lobbyist He (freely) pleaded GUILTY-twice!
If Team Trump/Pence, had been a competent American team, we would have had Rapid Testing, running like a well oiled machine.  We wouldn't  be worrying about workers, &amp; schools opening.  Team Trump/Pence shot an air ball. Now it's our turn to make a 3 pointer.
You can thank the new postmaster general, appointed by Trump for that.
Dissection of a Trump speach: 1) Reads from teleprompter = flat inflection, run-on sentences, frequent mispronunciations. 2) Ad-libs = crazy-speak in conspiratorial tones.  Dissection of the audience: 1) There bc F'ing crazy, 2) held captive by employer, or 3) is a reporter.
You made your choices. Your party will forever be the party of trump.
One of the cable pundits said with Trump it’s either confession or projection. He combines both in this rant.
FALSE
FALSE
Trump has a lower body count but yes.
Then you got it with Trump brother
The disparities between overall leads and handling of specific issues in this poll across the board are  ~ fascinating ~ It has Trump underwater on handling of coronavirus in South Carolina (!), yet he will not have to make a single swing through SC to win there by double digits
Never Trump means you are not welcome. GFY
A particularly interesting part of this poll:  is polling 3 points higher than  among Kentucky voters in who they think would do a better job addressing racial inequality.  Trump leads Biden by 9 points in this poll and won Kentucky in 2016 by ~30 points.
maybe trump will do it~~~
So Trump just announced in his speech in Ohio that Biden is against God. I'm voting for Biden because Trump is the Antichrist.
between this and trump we really have no hope
"it is what it is." - Trump
A threat? I said I was voting for her. I just pointed out that many Booker people as well as myself despise Donald Trump and being a pro Trump Democrat makes ZERO sense. I also pointed out that if this is a strategy and she doesnt indeed like Trump it's a losing strategy.
Trump seems to be doing well
To me it means never republican who supports trump #WeWillVote
So threats is what you think will sway Booker voters over to McGrath? I guess that is very pro Trump like. I'd be interested in what BS Booker people spout as well.
Who died and made Trump, Lord God? Eh, Dementia Don?!
The Great Amish American's will vote for President Trump! By the way, they don't have phones to participate in these phony polls.  🇺🇲🦅🗽🐘!
BTW voting for anyone other than HRC was a vote for Trump. So all y'all purity test mother fuckers need to own this too.
Biden could have this election in his back pocket if he just had other people talking for him. Ditto for Trump smh. How many times are we going to allow both to insult our intelligence? #Independent #freethinker
AA PRESIDENT TRUMP TO ANNOUNCE 10% TARIFF ON SOME CANADA ALUMINUM
Trump was banned...so we rational people get some peace.....
Watch Trump Elvis's Final Days Here:
tRump is desperate.
Never knew... welp, guess her and trump has something in common...
You are Trump’s 38%. Pass it on.
So, you're voting for tRump?
Yes. Her nonsensical Hillary Hate helped elect Trump in 2016
Breaking‼️ Trump at Chopper Talk Session: “I don’t know what’s going on.”
It must be REALLY crowded up trump's arse what with Pence, Navarro, Graham, &amp; so many others up there!
I MEAN GUYS C'MON NOW!! But yet   is racist when he is clearly trying to help EVERYONE brown, white, yellow, etc. whatever color you want to be!!!  says racist things everyday!! If you're an American TRUMP is the clear choice!!
No Sean, that's Trump's shit you're smelling. It's on your nose.
Absolute devotion to Donald J. Trump.
Don’t worry. By handicapping the corrupt NRA, Trump and GOP are taken cate of.
Trump thinks you are a weakling.
not only did Trump go there but there is a gazillion pics...he wished Ghislaine well...TWICE....the second time he doubled down on HOW WELL he wishes this pedophile....he is a pervert who was accused of raping a 13 yr old girl with Epstein. She was scared into silence....
I think we all know what trump was proposing, allowing local authorities to discriminate against projects that wished to build in 'affluent' neighborhoods. Obama banned such zoning, which is fully in line with what libertarians believe.  Trump likes the statist rules states used.
The only time tRump finds the Bible. 🤦‍♂️
Trump responds that he has aborted dozens of his own kids, and he doesn't think his lack of faith helped him at all.
Biden was against abortion before tRump ever was.
You hate trump bhe speeks the truth kids are immune to covid we know people that are 60 above are more likely to get it the older your are the closer the death you are the more sick as you age thats fact stop the bull tell the truth
Trump once again demonstrates his mastery of the Christian faith by claiming his devout Catholic political opponent has the ability to “hurt God.”
You must mean Trump. He’s the one that was given a cognitive test. No one believes he’s all there mentally. Listen to how he talks and looks.
You must mean Trump. He’s the one who did that.
Many people are rightly mocking Trump for claiming Biden will "hurt the Bible, hurt God."   But instead of criticizing Trump, let's ask ourselves: How will we help God today by being co-creators of the just world that God envisions for us?
I just finished watching The Loudest Voice on Showtime...they showed some footage of Trump in 2016, while he was never a great orator, he was Abe Lincoln back then compared to the word salad he is now. Plus he looked 20 years younger.
Trump is insane
Fearing covid and missed classes, many parents prefer mixing online and in-person school, poll finds
there are just as many pics of Trump with Epstein....also Trump is also on the flight logs to pedo island...but the right LOVES to ignore that fact..... Clinton AND Trump are both disgusting....they can both go to jail
Kentuckians have also wanted Moscow Mitch for years to correct? No one said Kentuckians were a bright group. My point has always been if McGrath would denounce her love or whatever it is of Trump publicly and loudly I think more Booker people would be on board.
What’s up with trending today? Trump and Clinton foundation? Michelle Obama is lowkey depressed? NY AG is trying to dissolve the NRA? Voting Rights Act? Haven’t even looked at that trend🤭. This is most certainly NOT a normal day on twitter!
u see wat happened to kaep😐i would be scared too if everything i ever worked for could be taken from me that quick. i promise you any NFL player would a wear a shirt goin against trump or whoever
Here's the thing  To Trump,  Trump = God  So yeah, from a certain perspective, he might be right.
This may sound different to GOP Trumpers.  But to me, it sounds like Trump's gurgling as he's circling the drain, gasping his last breath.  The stench of his fear and desperation nauseating.
why is he complimenting trump like this
my guess is husband won't be grabbing her pussy any time soon.   sex in the age of Trump
I only take issue in the implication that Trump Administration is somehow entirely to blame. Money does not equal immunity to "low grade depression". Lots of money can stave off complete misery.
we deadass gotta choose between him and trump
. facilities are COVID Hotbeds yet  just increased its shares in the company by 1000%
True! When President Trump first started talking about the China Virus, he was told that the Governer's were responsible for handling the outbreak in their states. Now the media is trying to make him look responsible for every death. Nursing homes had the most loss! Cuomo?
I’ll see your bumbling Trump and raise you one stumbling Joe.     Furthering my point that we are all, every single one of us, screwed.
The positive test for the coronavirus just ahead a planned meeting with President Donald Trump.
My brother lives in Ohio, big believer in Trump, we no longer speak...I cannot imagine him in a mask...😡
unfortunately it's no joke.  testing is great for trump.  trump is only interested in his own fat ass but if you're a regular joe schmo (ie, American citizen), you're on your own
A Biden / Trump debate will sound like a bowl of spaghetti-o’s being read aloud
You're right.  That's Trump's charity is gone.
I am sure he meant “much like” Even if he thinks that sentiment. He would not go on tv and say it. This election will be of old dudes who can’t read and misspeak a lot. The difference is Biden will surround himself with qualified people and not cronies like Trump.
You think Trump has a chance. That's too cute.
The far left appears determined to re-elect Trump. I say this as a progressive. My head is going to explode.
The Streets Are Quiet Again, Thanks To Trump-Barr Backing Down  The Feds Lost the Battle of Portland; the Secret Police Left Town and Nothing Bad Happened
Because Trump does not care about “all”of us. He cares about himself.
Why-o why- o why-o would he want Trump to visit Ohio?
You’re very welcome. Now if he’s a Trump supporter I’m going to charge him $9.99 and $3.99 shipping and handling. 😂
Would you look at that. Biden has trees and sky in his basement. Oh wait! It's just the Trump crime family lying AGAIN!
Gets a pass Trump 2020
"And it didn't matter one bit to Trump that he failed the vetting for his security clearance."
Same... exactly the same. Today was a warning shot, but nothing to change the NRA's illegal support of Trump's campaign.
Trump promoting Breitbart... shocking 😐 #FakeNews
A vote for someone other than Biden is a vote for someone other than Biden, not a vote for Trump. JFC.
Secretive group called TIP (Transition Integrity Project) is a bipartisan, anti-Trump organization created LAST YEAR out of concern that Trump will manipulate, ignore, undermine or disrupt the 2020 presidential election and transition process.
Trump is a disgrace to America!
NPR reports Ohio Gov.Mike DeWine has tested positive for COVID-19 though he has no symptoms and has canceled a scheduled meeting with President Trump.#COVID19
Imagine the media reaction had Trump said this or if Trump had suggested a black interviewer might be a junkie.
Anyone else think that  should excommunicate trump or that just me
Recently there was news about Facebook taking down 4 major network of bots that were skewing the FB metrics on engagements/interactions towards Trump.  I did not see how this was factored in while reading your article. Would this have changed your analyses ?
Rasmussen has 36% of likely voters currently think Biden has dementia. And Biden is winning in their same polls. Think about what that says about Trump.
Anyone with integrity would simply say “I don’t read the Bible. I’m not a Christian,” if the truth. So sick of people inserting Christianity into American politics like professed belief is a requirement to hold office.  If there was a benevolent God, would Trump exist? No.
Trump heads to Ohio as their governor gets the coronavirus
His widow told CNN that she penned the obituary blaming President Donald Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and those who do not wear masks because the pandemic hadn’t been taken seriously from the beginning and she wanted to “put blame where it belonged.”
The Venn diagram of fervent NRA defenders and Trump's rabid base is a single circle. This won't do shit.
Sounds like you are talking about Trump!😁😝😝😝🤣🤪
When are you going after Trump and his charity for the same things?
Great news! But I was hoping for enditements against Trump and/or his minions. Hope they come before the election
Where are these supposed Feds who are supposed to help? Trump is dragging ass
I am surprised Trump hasn't tried to take credit for this.America and the FBI was ready to close the file on General Flynn is being discussed in the US.
So the so-called “Lincoln Project”, goes into their own pockets.

Right but that was made expressly clear when Obama was shadowing Trump overseas. He made a point to come in right behind Trump to attempt undoing whatever Trump had laid groundwork for. "Nothing can stop what's coming".

You really think 4 more years of trump will be good for the American people? He’s had 4 years to make America better and today America is in terrible shape. We’ve trusted him to do the right thing and he’s continued to fail us. Not saying Biden is a saint. We just need change
This won’t be a conventional debate. It won’t be about Biden’s policies. It’s going to be about Trump defending HIS policies—his very untenable policies—AND his scandals. He has a record to defend now, &amp; it’s not a position he’s used to. I’m confident Biden can pull that thread.
Liberals literally be like, “Biden’s the less evil rapist”
If Joe and Kamala make an ad talking about policy and the failure of the president, then it ends with them putting on a red hat, and the narrator saying “make American great again. Vote Biden/Harris.
Does anybody seriously think that Biden can handle this job!This is a DANGEROUS WORLD! PLEASE THINK! The poor old guy can barely make it out of the basement. You may HATE TRUMP I get it! But the fate of the Country and World could most likely depend on this decision..
I would have to be shot dead. Otherwise, I’m voting for Biden/Harris.
Vote Biden and vote blue all the way
My wife said she’s voting Biden. What do I do?
I didn’t know an “us” existed. Until 2016 I had never not voted GOP (well, except KY senate, I won’t vote for McConnell). Voted libertarian in 16 and will likely vote Biden this year - not that it matters in KY 🤣
President Donald Trump on Friday told hundreds of New York Police Department officers that “no one will be safe in Biden’s America” if the former Democratic vice president defeats him in November .
The Postal Service union has endorsed Joe Biden.  The NY Police Dept. union has endorsed Donald Trump.  Until there are mass protests against letter carrier racial violence, I'm going to side with the mail.  #SaveTheUSPS
Compare to Biden and Harris, who shooed reporters away instead of answering questions so they could pretend to sign documents.
Ryan, I've said it before...how, in a country of 329M ppl, are Biden and Trump the best we can find to run for President? It's sad.
Dear Neolibs:  So just curious, What will you do or say if/when Biden wins and it doesn’t change anything about the fascism that is rising up? Are you going to proudly pat him and his administration on the backs when they continue to militarize the police?
What the heck is going on with people that judge our President Trump he’s the one who has been digging us out of the damage the last 8 years and now we see that he is going to move in and tell Biden how to make our Country a joke once more..
The nation has had enough of you and your lack of leadership. Why would anyone want to vote for a leader who has avoided handling the pandemic, had millions of Americans unemployed, and ignored the racial issues this country has? I’m with Biden/Harris. Get ready to lose.
Who? Biden?
Joe Biden is another one of your bad choices in men. You will never learn!

There are reports that if Joe Biden runs for president, he would promise to serve for only one term – because nothing says confidence like promising your presidency would be over quickly." –Jimmy Fallon
Has it occurred to you that many do not see a meaningful difference in harm between Trump and Biden? That the "reduction" is only skin-deep?
White House Watch: Biden lengthens lead, finding that he does not need to take questions as his strategists suggests. It is truly Trump vs. Trump.
Obama, Trump and hypothetically Biden are not the actual rulers of this country. They're just the public spokesperson.  The actual rulers are the ones who write their checks. And they write checks to both parties.  All of them serve capital.
Obama hired Hillary?? Am I mistaken? Obama hired Joe Biden. Biden hired Harris. By your logic I can easily Obama and Biden are shit.
Stop this nonsense, you're pretending as if  Biden is running away from the media. They know where to get Biden if they want ask him any questions. Biden is not Hillary Clinton and he has been in politics for decades and he is master of the game.
🙋‍♂️I’m already saying president joe Biden
Even mother fucking Trump had a platform that he wanted to carry out. It all comes down to politics and congress.   You set a goal and work towards that. Biden's platform is extremely progressive. Will he get it all done? Depends on who is running the House and Senate.

Joe Biden, who said integration would cause a racial jungle, picks Kamala Harris, a black woman who forced black men to fight forest fires for $2 a day and caused the caging of non violent plant smokers as VP to challenge Trump, the orange President.
Meanwhile, Biden is still in his basement.
This fool talking about "its an honor to run against you" like he's a legit candidate. Boy if you don't go somewhere and sit your disrespectful self down somewhere. How bout you fix your marriage and let Biden/Harris worry about fixing the country!
Guns scare tactics? Nope, Biden and Cammy have both stated they will confiscate many, if not all guns. If you want to join them and repeal the second amendment, then find 38 states to approve a change in the Constitution.  The big scare will be their policies
Biden can't even speak because he forgets everything, thanks to his senile dementia. 🤣 🤣 🤣

He blocked me simply for saying Trump was gonna wipe the floor with Biden.
Tom Slick draws more people than Biden
The armed protestors never destroyed anything(that I know of). The governor mandates are illegal as not approved by congressional body - governors aren’t kings. You just deflected my comment. Harris/Biden do not stand for law and order and encourage destruction of property
No US president has ever been punished for their crimes. Maybe President Warren would have bucked that trend, but Biden? There's no way he'd do something that the GOP could spin as nakedly partisan and uncivil.
She was taught well by Biden and in such a short time.
Kamala lies non stop. It is absurd. What a class act and the perfect compliment to Biden 🙄
So everyone voting for Biden (myself included) can ignore trump  and his pointless , mindless , idiotic rhetoric.
Her and Biden will get along great then, they can share pudding recipes and sniff each other enthusiastically.
where is the excitement for Biden?  Serious question.  These mini Trump rallies are popping up everywhere.  I’m not seeing the same for Biden.  No excitement at all outside of the liberal media.

I don’t care if you hate Trump. You don’t have a half brain if you think Biden or Harris can serve as POTUS.
Hopefully our county will be blessed with a president of deep faith in January 2021 when VP Biden replaces the creature that currently occupies the White House.
Could we just hold off on the whole let‘s force Biden to fix everything that Trump didn’t do or he’s not taking it seriously? It would be nice to have daily briefings but that should be pretty far down the list of priorities
I was a huge Biden fan (I voted for him over Obama in the primaries Bain 2008😆) I’m dismayed by several aspects of his personality and him being our candidate when we had so many other options...it felt predetermined. He will be a fine leader though and better than this hell.

Instead of voter shaming you should probably give me reasons why to vote for war criminal Biden.
Just a guess.. President Donald Trump donated to Kamala Harris' California AG campaign. 10 years later he’s throwing a temper tantrum because 1) Biden / Harris ticket wins in November 2) assumes money buys loyalty 3) Harris will eviserate Pence in VP debate..
Oddly after the court decision we hear that she's interested in the Biden administration 😳.  Oh dear God 🙏 we don't want that.

Here's What Rush Limbaugh Says Joe Biden's Mask Mandate is Really All About
💯   Senator Harris was my first pick for Pres.  I’m still peeved that she was out so early in the run.  My hope is she is VP for a term, makes it clear she’s better as Pres, and Biden steps aside for her to run in 2024.
Wrong. I can clearly give you what Trump is running for - lower taxes, deregulation, finish the wall, pro-life, conservative judges, etc. Biden is running for gun control (confiscation), abortion on demand, green new deal, and of course “anti-Trump.”
Do you desire to fight Covid 19 as Americans have always met and defeated every challenge or do you desire to shrink from this latest challenge by hiding in the basement wearing a mask and face shield muttering inane platitudes... Trump v Biden..  With whom do you stand..??..🇺🇸🇺🇸
No need to mandate everyone when not all areas are as hard hit. That's like giving everyone a band-aid when only one person has a cut. Plus, didn't we try that already by shutting down the whole country? Biden must have forgotten! Signs of things to come if he is elected.
That it is. Biden would likely die or become incapacitated in office. Then Kamala Harris is in charge.  God help us!

I really do feel bad for you, Jeff. Your blind faith towards this President that makes him immune to criticism in your eyes would make our founding fathers weep. Trump has sold out American workers and Biden’s union backing is clear of that.

No, what I’m saying is that with a 7-2 far right Supreme Court, $15 minimum wage is impossible for a generation.  Even if Biden doesn’t get it done, you can primary him from the left in 2024 and get it done then.
As a retired letter carrier, I ask my brothers and sisters to fully support the Biden/ Harris team. For YEARS we have heard that the GOP wanted to privatise the PO. That time has arrived. Your jobs REALLY do depend on removing Trump from office. Vote Dem on Nov 3rd.

Biden is a sex pest and connected with thousands of predator drone bombings, Epstein(trump is too), and has always been anti lgbt and poc in his policies. There’s a lot more bad about Biden then Hillary

I’m for wearing a mask in store’s or places like that! But enough with Biden to force wearing masks anywhere outside! SO I WILL CARRY MY PROTEST SIGN PROTESTING WEARING MASKS!!! AND WILL CARRY WEAPONS SO I CAN LOOK LIKE THOSE ASSWIPE RIOTERS!!! EVERYWHERE I GO!!!!!!!
If Baby Biden does not debate Trump either should VP debate flip flop! She’s a fish out of her mind!!!
Biden, has gotten things backwards most of his life.
Kiss my ass joe Biden.
Disagree. My President didn’t say this. CDC hasn’t said this. I’m not a mindless joe Biden follower.
He said he's against the platform, not Biden. It is possible to have nuance. You can think someone is better than Trump (not a high bar) &amp; still not always agree w/ them. You have to look at the situation as a whole. Picking &amp; choosing what you want to hear makes you ill-informed

How Joe Biden picked his VP running mate. 😂😂
I think that Biden could not have picked a better VP than Kamala. I’m really excited to have a strong woman of color running alongside of him. What are your thoughts? Sorry for the correction but some people was very concerned about my spelling.
Ten years ago Biden spoke at the funeral of KKK member Robert Byrd. So there’s that.

I’m not crazy about Biden. But I can’t stand trump! So this is how I feel about our options.

Trump has done a good job. Biden has said nothing that makes me believe he could do as good, much less, better than Trump. Harris is too radical and she will end up as President if Biden is elected.
Now this is an odd ending to this tweet. Does  have some insider knowledge tha Biden is not going to complete a full term.
Okay, is the black community secured for Biden? 🙄
See what Biden tryna do there with Kamala Harris. 😌

#FoxNews sounds like Bret is voting Biden-Harris! Sure Martha will join him.
I thought the same thing, the very very same thing. He definitely rambles a lot, a lot, a lot. And repeats himself constantly. And repeats himself constantly.   Still has my vote because Biden can’t form a sentence and will be a puppet but I do agree with ya.
Biden definitely, completely picked a female VP.  People voted for Trump because they hated Clinton... "it's a man's job" was a terrible terrible excuse so they didn't have to explain why they didn't like Hillary.
Hopefully Biden will reach out and actually try to talk to Ice Cube and many others like him and truly listen to what they say. We all know Trump won’t.
Biden PLEASE PICK CRAZY NANCAY!!!!! THAT WAY WE KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE!!!!!!!!!👍👍👍👍
Personal opinion on the Biden VP saga: His team screwed it up from the start. There’s no way for him to make a pick that unifies factions. The roll out is botched before it starts. It’s lose-lose for him. He doesn’t have savvy people doing this. Beats me as to why that is.
Congratulations,  Wait...  Also, let’s not capitalize every word of headlines any longer.
The Biden Agenda for the Latino Community | by Joe Biden | Aug, 2020 | Medium
Speaking as a liberal and longtime registered Democrat.  One should NEVER underestimate the Democratic Party's capacity to actively lose when they are a sure thing to win.  People giving Biden hell for keeping his mouth shut? That's the smartest thing any Dem has done in years.
Biden is winning in the Polls!! But I guess not with the American people! U  know where to stick those POLLS!!!
You all realize that Biden is on record stating that he wants to kill Social Security too, right?  There was a whole conversation about this back in the primary.  Remember the primary?  Trump is a goon and needs to lose, but don't pretend Biden is on our side.  He's not.

Serious question! If the GOP manages to come up with some dirt on Biden and cause a huge scandal. Will you still vote for him no matter what? #imridenwithBidennomatterwhatI can’t stress this enough, fuck Matt Parlmer who said he wouldn’t vote for Biden if Harris was the VP and calls  a murder
For Joe’s birthday let’s all commit to vote for Biden. Happy Birthday Joe. Hope you get what you want in November.
Funny how folks are sayin Biden has dementia. Does anyone remember Reagan’s last term? Cause I’m pretty sure he sure as hell didn’t.
Opinion | Trump stokes fear. Biden and Harris can raise hope.
Also,why didn't Biden give good ideas to Obama while he was VP?
Biden also wanted to gut welfare.... That money didn't just come up out of nowhere. Any idea on how they got that much funding?

Sounds like even Trump is voting for Biden:
… by reverting to "General Washington" in retirement, or the plain citizen's title of "Mr.” SO protocol indicates Senator Biden, Senator (H) Clinton, Mr. (B) Clinton.
The senator has that same magnetic smile that Obama had, back in the days before Mitch McConnell wore him down, a smile that fills you with hope about what America can be.
Replace Biden with Bernie at the presidential candidate slot
that's not true! Biden is legit the most far left Dem presidential candidate we've ever had!
Biden's policies will lead to less death, guess you're pro-death (obv kidding)
as soon as Biden "tells" University of Delaware to release his records!
but Biden is more left than Trump, so you should vote for him
People have the lamest reasons for disliking Joe Biden.
well, the reason I don't think that's a good idea is that I believe that moving to the left (i.e moving to the middle) would make it more likely for Biden to lose, so it's not just me being an asshole, it's a political calculation
4 votes coming for Biden!  5 if I can get ballot for my dog if Trump is telling the truth. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
It is because as soon as they steal the election and swear Biden in, he will resign and make Kamila president. This has been the an all along. Biden is a filler at best.

I think the challenge may be running as a sitting VP.  Does she leave herself room to pivot from Biden in certain areas - if she needs it?  Also, she is a formidable candidate, but not a great campaigner - see 2016.  She will have to figure that out in the next couple of years.
Biden is somehow sleepy and senile but is also the vanguard of the revolution

Professor Allan Lichtman has predicted every election since 1984. Lichtman says before 2020, Trump appeared to be heading to a reelection. However Trump has now lost seven keys.
I sent her some clips.  No response.  I also sent the one of Dump on the ramp and Biden riding the bike.  😂
I have my hand raised (and I am yawning, because I am so bored with Obama and Biden’s lies!).
You completely missed my point. Shame really. Biden is in no way capable or qualified for that matter to be president. Only someone greedy&amp; power hungry would accept the VP nomination. Male or female but she happens to be a female.
Mark Nickolas must do digital for Biden as a side hustle.
BIDEN IS SO LOST &amp; CANNOT CUT IT MR. AXELROD!!!!!
And? How often have we heard Pence speak the last 4 years? How often did we hear Biden speak as VP? Spend half an hour listening to McConnell garbling into a mic, or Cruz whining, or Trump rambling; none of it is pleasing, but a voice is a genetic factor you can’t control.
Don't let a single liberal get away with co-opting the term "leftist."   If you tell people to vote for Biden, you aren't a leftist.

If anyone thinks voting Biden is going to save America, they're the problem.
Yes. Many have argued that Biden is more likely to be influenced by direct action than Trump, and so you have to vote for Biden, etc.  They fail to grasp that regardless of who's in power, the only way to influence people who only care about money is to attack their money.
I love how the people who demand you vote for Joe Biden also argue that the only way to get what needs to be done done is by direct action, but under Biden.  I wish they spent half the energy they do voter shaming on actually organizing direct action instead...
Why does the CA ballot have “Vice President Joseph Biden”?  Shouldn’t it be either “FORMER Vice President” OR “Senator” since there is only 1 VP? Any protocol experts  out there?
I believe Biden wasn’t among the options to choose from in that poll.
Wait I thought Biden was dementia king
As long as Kamala keeps talking about him I am sure he won’t let her accusations go unanswered. Plus if Biden gets elected he won’t be there for long. I think the dems know that. He is just a prop.
Frida.  The point is Biden has 40 years for experience.  Trump can’t even win an Emmy for his reality TV show.   63% of Americans can understand this basic concept.
He has threatened to block every bill if Biden wins. So what else is new?
Smart move by both Biden and Buttigieg.    Pete resonated in Iowa, and gets to keep his name out there, and Biden can take advantage of Pete's good-will in the community.
Has anyone had more practice running for President since Henry Clay than Joe Biden?
I haven’t seen the numbers but maybe more people voted for Trump than Biden is because of all the other candidates on the Democratic ticket. A lot of people still voted for who they liked white T got all the Rep votes. What were the totals? D vs R?
don't think that aoc needs your help.  in fact you would be more helpful in helping  organize a strike, or being a high profile proxy to  and defend her by calling out joe biden.  those are two things that you could do to reach out to progressives.
Agreed and if Biden steals the election I have a feeling that the country will be split wide open and we’ll see riots and major properties of major cities burned to the ground. Most people are unwilling to live under communism, real or perceived.
Trump claimed Biden has been wrong about the coronavirus pandemic at every turn, “ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.”

Ungracious!  Biden’s comment insinuates that he had some part to play in today’s peace accords - just one more untruth in his long history of “false and misleading claims.”
Are you really sure? And when they do, what kinds of questions will be asked? I assume you've seen the few times Mr. Biden has been questioned it's been mostly softball. Not to mention, there's been a document released from the dem party with a "how to" question Ms. Harris.
I have no idea. 🤷‍♀️ I try not to presume anything about my fellow citizens. 😊 It would seem though that the Biden-Harris team certainly presumes to know our minds. 🤔
he literally said this for governors to do, he wasn't saying to do it federally. Yes, if you're actively endangering others, cops should get involved. This is an incredibly sophistic take, Biden argues for reduced police funding, not elimination of said police

I think not debating benefits Biden.
'Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum.'
Biden finally comes up with a proposal that  hasn't already done. And its, drum roll please, to force everyone everywhere to wear a mask when alone.  He sees us as his choldren, except we dont get the graft. #leftylies

I also feel the need to clarify that my original tweet isn't equating a third party vote with a vote for Trump. I'm specifically referencing the people who are choosing not to vote, or choosing to vote for Trump just because they don't like Biden.
Trump supporters aren't worried about Biden.. just like they didn't worry about Hillary. The democratic party in a civil war would be funny.. clueless adults (kids) that have yet to grow up..
So Biden paired with a more liberal Congress is going to be a lot better for the country than Trump with any kind of Congress.
That's an understandable opinion, but that's not really what I was going for with my tweet. Biden sucks, yes, but Trump poses an active threat to the lives of many. Being able to ignore that because you don't like Biden is a position of privilege.

Um, this is Biden vs. Trump. Why is all the punditry trying to twist this into Harris vs. Trump. So bizarre. I don't remember this being the case in 2008 when McCain selected Palin. But maybe that was the case when she was first announced.
I think this election will be about people wanting to vote Trump out vs people wanting to keep him. Biden is by no means an inspirational choice. Unlike 2016, I think more moderate and independents will want him out. Since now we know what he is capable of.
Coming up today...  1:35 - Dr. Anthony Fauci joins us to discuss COVID-19 and School protocol. #Fauci   2:05 -  discusses Joe Biden choosing Kamala Harris as his running mate.  Show starts in five minutes.
Joe Biden doesn’t need KH to blow it for him. He’s doing a great job of that for himself. I don’t think she will help him but I don’t think she will hurt him. I do wonder if we will ever see him again. I think she will take over the campaigning for both of them.
Reagan: “Government can’t solve the problem. Government is the problem” Revised by me today: “Republican men can’t solve the problem. Republican men are the problem.” Go Biden/Harris!!
The pair are expected to discuss their shared vision for how to defeat President Donald Trump and then lead the country through a pandemic, its economic fallout and a long-simmering reckoning with systemic racism.
I miss your grandfather's tweets a great deal. I always vote, but this year, I'll be thinking about him when I cast my vote for Biden/Harris.
Matt, you are completely wrong with this. Biden is 78 years old with rapidly diminishing mental capacity, Kamala is not just VP choice she will be the defacto President at least within 2 years.. Like her or not With Biden, this pick is huge..
I still think Biden is going to win big, but Biden is definitely doing everything he can to cost himself the  election so I'm not as certain now.
That's funny.  Look at the multiple crises left by Obama-Biden. Difference is they created crisis, Trump is undermined by nature and infantile lefties acting their emotional age. #leftylies
I'm tired and depressed. I realize and celebrate the historic importance of Biden's choice but I am deeply disappointed by how Warren was treated. No recognition or appreciation of her candidacy and the woman herself. I have even more respect and admiration for her now.
IM RIDEN WITH BIDEN!!
The way many on (what passes for) the left think a Biden/Harris win is inevitably is, frankly, insane.
Biden is Catholic, of course.  Tobin is trying to play an anti-choice card, but his wit is insufficient; if Biden weren't Catholic, then Tobin's "first time in a while" would be..."since 2012".  Headline this one: "Pittsburgh-Providence Priest Plays Partisan Politics Poorly"...
Yes. Again, political commentary from pundits. It will be Biden vs Trump.
That's just silly. In 0 American elections is the VP going up against the incumbent president. Anything to the contrary is silly political commentary. The Harris pick matters now, and if/when her and Pence debate, but come November it is Biden vs. Trump
Biden announcing Harris as his VP is the best news I’ve heard in months. VOTE. VOTE. VOTE (the Cheeto outta the office)
I think I had to much left over adrenaline from yesterday that I slept horribly! Nice to wake up and realize the announcement wasn’t a dream though! Ready to put in some work for Biden and Harris today!
because of my loyalty to tara reade i can't vote for biden, and because of my love for the rest of humanity, i wouldn't vote for trump.
If insanity prevails and Biden/Harris win it won’t be long until Harris takes over as president. Who will be the VP then? Nancy?
Glad to have you along, Republicans for Joe Biden!
Joe Biden picked her😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do justice, love kindness, walk humbly.
That’s very short sighted imo. Yes him and kamala have very moderate platforms and I personally don’t agree with all of them, but not voting for Biden means a higher chance of trump winning. And America can’t have another term of trump as president without irreversible damage
Case in point, the nomination of Senator Harris...  Dems who are serious about police and judicial reform (and who are informed and think critically) can’t possibly support her on the Biden ticket, can they?
Bad pick Biden could have picked a more moderate African American he screwed up
She hated Biden in run off
66% of white kids grow up fatherless... there's more single white mothers than the entire black population in America... there would probably be a lot more black fathers in the home if biden and others didn't lock black men up for 30 years for non-violent crimes..
She didn’t like Biden in preliminary race
Today is August 12, 2020 and it’s 83 days until Election Day  Now we have the Dream Team of Biden Harris   They stand for integrity, strength with grace, decency and compassion   I can’t wait to cast my vote for Biden Harris   #BidenHarris2020  #FreshTweets
He didn't do anything to specifically harm the community like biden has... I'd rather have a president who does just ignores us than to have one who purposely goes out of his way to harm us
Opinion | Kamala Harris met the most important qualification for Biden’s running mate
Opinion | Kamala Harris was the safest, most experienced and most tested choice Biden could make
Joe Biden picked Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. Biden said Harris was smart, talented, and an experienced malarkey fighter.
Today on 91.3 WUKY's ME. Joe Biden names Kamala Harris as his running mate. Big 10 &amp; Pac 12 cancel all fall sports. Belarus Presidential candidate flees to Lithuania. Plus, local news, weather &amp; traffic.
No one is telling you not to vote for Biden. We're simply saying that we aren't wasting our time with it, and we're sick and fucking tired of assholes hounding us over it.  If you want Biden to win, pressure his campaign to better appeal to us. Otherwise, leave us the fuck alone.
Real talk though, Kamala Harris is not the radical left but she’s a fake who will do anything to advance her status. Hillary 2.0. Go from calling Joe Biden racist pretty much, to being his VP candidate LOL.
IF THE CLINTONS, OBAMA'S,  BIDEN,  PELOSI THINK THAT THEY WILL GET AWAY WITH DESTROYING OUR FREEDOMS,  THEY GOT A REVOLUTION ON THEIR HANDS!! WE VETERANS WILL NOT LET OUR AMERICA BE DESTROYED!!  WE VETERANS WILL FIGHT FOR THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE SERVED HER BEFORE!!  WE LOVE HER
Thank you so much for your endorsement of Joe Biden’s VP pick!    I’d be much more concerned if you had anything nice to say.  Thanks again!
So, as I am certain most Americans are curious about this, did you sleep with Biden also to seal the deal?
I don’t even like politics but y’all tripping with biden/harris...
Look here...do you have another way to get rid of Trump outside of Joe Biden?   If not, then what are we even talking about....?
🎶 She's got a ticket to ride  She's got a ticket to ride  She's got a ticket to ride  Kamala’s there 🎶   - The Beatles   She’s Ridin with Biden all the way to the Whitehouse!!!  #BidenHarris2020  #FreshTweets
Considering Biden's age and fuzziness, odds are higher she would become president. So her relative importance goes up.
Kamala and the left: Biden is a racist and a rapist. But we have to win.  Same people: How can you vote for Trump?  Trump voters that think he's an awful person: Welcome to the real world jerks.
So Biden is a Catholic Racist sexual predator in her eyes....and she still said yes.... damn hypocrite much!   Kamala Harris’s Anti-Catholic Bigotry
The Biden Harris ticket is from the pit of hell. We must vote Trump or we will die!
If there is a presidential debate (which I doubt) it might be the most watched show of the year.  Biden will forget where he is and who his running mate is and Trump will continually talk about how this will be his third term and how huge his two previous wins were.
This dude. A literal non-chess piece bishop from Rhode Island does not know Biden is Catholic and went on ahead and popped off. I’ll let y’all extrapolate whatever you’d like.
Guys it's okay. Biden can have Kamala as VP and you can still be ACAB heavy. I'm looking at it as "okay prove something to the people. Do good by them and for them. Or go down as another shit stain of a politician and make ACAB beliefs stronger".
Leaving dead supporters in his wake. We who support Vice President Biden want him and us to stay healthy.
I think weed is the least of Hunter Biden’s problems
I didn’t know Biden was the cure all for coronavirus 😂😂😂

This is the problem with Democrats. They’d rather bitch than be happy. Republicans would vote for an orange cone just to win. I don’t care what Biden it Harris have done. I’m voting for them.
just wait till biden calls misgenders her or calls her carmelo...the left will be like eh no biggy
MAJOR coup for Nancy Pelosi, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerburg......a slap in the face to the Clintons and Obamas (they needed Rice as vp).  Biden will resign within six months and Harris will be President with Pelosi as the puppet master.
Kamala seems like the best option on Biden’s short list. She’s definitely a better pick than Rice, who has terrible baggage, an unpleasant personality, and has never been elected to anything.
Says the piece of shit! There! Now you can be a big girl and spell it! No need for that cute emoji! You are one of the”smart” ones who actually think Biden actually won the nomination and picked Kameltoe as a partner!!!! GTFOH!!🖕🏻dumb mother fuckers don’t like people talkin shit!
Kamala Harris is not good for progressives, but fits the moderate Democrat picture that Biden is going for, and she is ultimately more progressive than Biden. #SettleForBiden
Once again, Biden calls upon his psionic warriors to Seal this Boo Boo Bear Within The Earth.
If Biden wins, he will quickly be removed using the 25th amendment, leaving Harris and her far left progressive handlers in charge, that's the plan, mark my words.
Someone with the charisma of Barack Obama, thankfully, just paved the way for Biden to win big.
No one:  The Biden campaign picking Kamala:
#Repost mercurial_era (with  ... #Repost joebiden ・・・ Biden • Harris
Annnnnd just like that joe Biden’s campaign is over
So..didnt K. Harris say she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted women and if Im not mistaken didnt she call him a racist...so let me get this right, Biden picked a running mate who thinks he is a racist sexual predator bwwhahahah!! Fn Idiot!!! This country is doomed!
Flashback: Kamala Harris said she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching  #FoxNews
Apparently, Tucker is endorsing Biden.
If you honestly believe that Biden picked Harris for any reason besides identity politics, I want you to know that the word "gullible" is written on the ceiling above you.
.  Biden's father was a used car salesman. Mystery solved. #LyinBiden #PutThatInYourPipe #Patheads
They're literally just rubbing the left's faces into Biden's poo...
honestly anyone who donates to biden instead of investing in local on-the-ground community work is a total mark who values spectacle over material reality
Biden Harris is better than Clinton Kaine, but oh boy do we still need better.
Biden &amp; Harris:  No-Knock Campaigning
We'd guess that Biden is already making up his cabinet even though he hasn't yet won the presidency. He needs to move quickly as soon as he is sworn in. The country is in need of some competent leadership. Kamala Harris is a good choice for vice president.
Kamala Harris chosen as Biden’s VP.   Amy Klobuchar’s staff hardest hit.
Yeah.... Biden/Hitler definitely doesn’t get my vote...
What do you think of Biden's pick? MORE &gt;&gt;&gt;
Opinion | Biden needed a running mate prepared to serve as president. Kamala Harris met that test.
Yes, and in the same breath he called Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden names. Irony is just another thing that trump has destroyed. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpVirus #BidenHarris2020
I’m not voting for Biden. I wasn’t anyway, but I’m deciding not now. 🙄
So Biden (instrumental in the drug war and crime bill) nominates a bulldog prosecutor known for aggressive tactics at a time people are in the streets protesting over policing. Cool cool.
When did Biden say not to play?
I'm not sure I was hoping for anyone in particular that Biden would have realistically chosen.
BTW, you can be genuinely disappointed in Biden picking Harris without being a sexist asshole. And you can recognize that this is the lesser evil while being rightfully enraged that we keep being asked to choose a lesser evil.
And no moral principles. Colbert cornered her on her vicious racist smears on Biden. Her answer? "It was a debate, it's what you do." This is Matt's use of a good VP?
Stacy Abrams has stated she will still accept the nomination for VP, giving Biden an out if Kamala gets upset with him sniffing her hair
I cant wait to tweet Biden and Harris WIN!
Well with Biden you never know. Ok, you do always know.
It'll be so much better when President Joe Biden is the one you see walking in.
Not sure I had any "hopes" with Biden. It's more that in the midst of a national reckoning with police violence and mass incarceration we have a lifelong prosecutor in the VP slot.
Wish we had Biden of '08 of the VP debate against Palin.
Just in case you're out there thinking about writing how "dems just aren't excited about her" I AM FUCKING ECSTATIC ABOUT THIS VP PICK
Hillary was always within the margin or error, Biden is not.  I know you won't understand this but there is a big difference.
Trump is ridiculous.  He calls a church going Biden, a man who "is against God."   Plain stupidity.
so  do you still believe that biden is a racist, and do you believe the women who have called him out for being a creep? #Metoo ?
Latest polling indicates 20% of respondents say they’ve NEVER heard of Biden VP pick Sen Kamala Harris. That’s more than 60 million Americans 😳 think  about  that  for  a  minute 🤔 #KamalaHarrisForVP
Joe Biden selecting Kamala Harris is kind of like the halftime show where people jump off trampolines
I really hope there was some kind of sophisticated political calculus behind Biden's pick of Harris for VP, because I am having a hard time figuring out which relevant swing voters she is supposed to attract.
I’m a voting ass dude so Biden will get my vote but damn I will be dragging my ass to the ballot.
I love Bernie but I hate when he puts the nation before his progressive agenda. We know you ain’t for this Biden shit.
I'm so excited! Biden &amp; Harris can make America America again.
Agreed ... once Biden took over the race, this was the most likely outcome
If Trump loses, GOP recalibrates, looks for someone who didn’t go full #MAGA. (Mitt Romney will be as old as Biden is today...)  If Biden loses, Harris joins Kaine, Ryan, Palin, Edwards, Lieberman, Kemp, Stockdale, Bentsen and Ferraro as losing VP candidates never seen again.
Anyone not bothered by Trump's grotesque mishandling of the COVID-19 epidemic, his racism, criminal acts, childish behavior etc. isn't going to care one iota about who Biden chose for his VP.
This Dem is sad and disappointed. Warren was the one. Harris is ok but she does not excite me. Biden made the safe, predictable choice.
1) UK will have maybe their best team in decades, if not ever. If we we were ever going to do something funky with Ohio State do it now. Why not?  2) Not my first choice but I have no issue voting for a Biden/Harris ticket. Sign me up.
She stated publicly that she believes Biden's sexual assault accusers, and called him a 'vile racist' on a national stage one year ago.🤦😂
Did Joe Biden ask #Copmala to get that work done to her face? Was it not sniff worthy for him?
But you said you prefer action, a Biden Harris admin will take actions to stop the exact abuses that Harris committed! Another Trump admin won’t
Harris was a pretty easy choice for Biden. There was tons written in 2016 that decreased African-American turnout cost Hillary. If you think Harris will boost that number she totally makes sense. Biden and team guessing record won't matter. Right? Who knows. But not a crazy pick.
BIDEN READ THE ROOM BITCH
Bet? I'm all in Biden wins. I'll give you odds.
Alot of people on the left don't like it because they want another Bernie-esque person to be VP, they want further progressive. I like the pick, I felt Biden needed a heavy hitter and more well known candidate than Rice (more baggage) and Bass.  Also Kamala going to shred Pence.
With prison/police/court reform being at the forefront of America right now, Biden could not have picked a worst candidate.
My first pick over Biden!
YAHOO!  Congratulations!  Great pick,  !!!! BIDEN/HARRIS2020
THE LATEST: Joe Biden announced that Sen. Kamala Harris will be his running mate in the 2020 presidential election.

Biden goes for rhetorical skill instead of pursuing a geographic strategy.  The smart move, I think.

Biden’s VP could be a newborn kitten and I would still vote for them
I would not. I dont think all that highly of Biden. I believe the DNC picked the worst possible person
Remember, Republicans are helping West try to get on the ballot - in order to drain votes from Biden.
Unfortunately young progressives already busy bashing Biden. At a guess will be equally harsh or worse with VP. I wldn't have picked Biden either but I get how it works. So will support him &amp; whichever running mate. And I'd like to smack the next one who "okay boomer"s me...
Why didn’t we just nominate a strong woman (person of color or not) for the top of our party’s ticket in the first place?!?! Threatening Biden over his VP pick now isn’t a good look. 🤦🏼‍♂️
Biden played college football. 😍 Is this his attempt to prop something uo &amp; knock it down at the same time? All he does is neg. He’d make a terrible bf. LOL 🤣🏈
If the Democrats have no more candidates that people like that... then they’re screwed! NOT WE’RE SCREWED! I’ll never by their standards!the Fact they are using a guy like Biden to ensure a black woman gets in office shows their character and humanity! That man isn’t healthy!
Joe Biden will announce his VP pick soon... 🙄 yeah I haven’t heard that lie for weeks. #BasementBiden   The only way Trump loses the elections is if the democrats get away with cheating and stealing it away from the people. #Trump2020
Is Biden really gonna pick Cameltoe Harris as a running mate? 😎  I meant Kamala!
And Biden is impaired? Give. Me. A. Break.
The Clintons left office in debt because of all the costs associated with the blue dress scandal. They wrote books.   Obamas wrote best seller books and had speaking engagements  Biden has been frugal with his money, and has pensions associated with his public service.
I feel like there are better options than Bill. Also noteable would be R’s for Biden.
I ♡ Joe Biden and hope Kamala is on his ticket! #ballstomping

It must be because you are in your bunker that you can't see Biden out and about.
Respectfully turn off Fox News and take a deep breath. The country isn’t on fire.   If Biden becomes President, your life will change almost not at all.   Covid sucks. Violence in some areas suck. But we have been through much worse and we will get through it
If Biden picks a female African American running mate, everything will be “racist” AND “sexist!”
: "If you elect Biden, I'll go to jail."
And I am sure a donation of $5,600 is not the reason Biden will choose his VP when the campaign will cost over $1 billion...
“Utterly brilliant...”  Biden voter.  Smh
Biden was actually coherent and well spoken back then.  Big difference from today

Okay so Biden was not the first choice for me but can’t we all just agree to vote for him because he gives off that friendly papaw vibe that caused us to let George W. Bush get away with war crimes.

It's not goofy things alone. But it's visual decline. Nobody can look at him and say he is as good now as he was 4 years ago and that's fine. But he starts at such a lower cognitive spot than Biden so his decline is markedly worse.
Again, I dont disagree. Anyone at that age is not better with time. But again, comparing Biden to Trump when it comes to cognitive decline is not an argument you want to be making if you are Trump. Biden starts from a higher point and Trump's decline is visually measurable.
I would disagree but to compare any level of cognitive decline between Biden and Trump is not an argument I'd want if I were Trump.
The hill this goes down has a much deeper and much worse end for Trump than for Biden. We all know this.
So you are attributing to Biden  what is apparent in trump.

You keep missing the disconnect between the poll ##s on how many want medicare4all, etc &amp; how they actually voted in primary. Biden wldn't be the candidate if they voted as if those things mattered.
I hope you're right and they give Biden a huge and resounding victory, but there are still a disturbing number of Trumplodytes who are satisfied as long as someone pisses off Libs &amp; appoints anti-abortion judges.  If so, the Country, Constitution &amp; everything else can go to Hell.
It is simply a push back against ignorant Trump cultists who claim Trump is physically and cognitively superior to Biden. Trump a physical slob and intellectually worse.

Biden's first Executive Order should be to declare orange skin tanning lotion a national emergency, just to see what color Trump actually is.
He’s going to start taking credit for this with the same zeal he takes credit for “veterans choice” which was also signed into law by Obama. He’s publicly taken credit for VA choice dozens and dozens of times.  Biden should start saying he created Medicare and Social Security.

Can you imagine what Dr. Biden can do with education...OMG!   Bit better than a two bit stripper that barely finished high school, married to a crime boss.
Is our government doing enough to protect us from influence operations by Russia, China, and Iran efforts to interfere with our election?  and  are using Russian disinformation to advance partisan interest against Biden.
He’s a useful idiot so I’m sure it will spread disinformation about Biden.
People are tore up over him saying that but old dementia Joe has lost his mind. he is a racist if there ever was one he definitely is that is Joe Biden. I wouldn't vote for that sucker if he was the only one running.
Great idea! :) I did before I wrote the message and couldn't find any stats that looked like Biden's. Honest question if anyone out there can find stats from 2020. If your google history works like mine  you should have it in a sec
tRump's the evil here, IMHO. If China wants Biden, it's because they fear the instability brought by the orange TweetFührer.
Soooooo, to make this real simple and draw it in crayons for the #Trumptards. The Russians do not want  to be president. That’s a good thing. See now ya know.

I have grown weary and quit watching her. Warren has essentially been erased by MSNBC and other major news outlets. I will support Biden no matter his VP pick, but this complete erasing of Warren really pisses me off.
Joe Biden just supports the taxpayer funded killing of the unborn. Very Catholic...
Biden is clearly experiencing cognitive decline, there is plenty of evidence to suggest it. But, Trump is cognitively declining as well. We've seen that for years. For someone to say you should vote for Trump for that reason is just hypocritical.

All of the trumpers I've "discussed" all of these issues with, dont believe it ,or they send me a photoshopped photo of Biden... It's so odd to me that everyone of them stick to the same script... Is thier a trump supporter web site that they go to in order to justify themselves?
From Trump's perspective, I can see where he'd think Biden will hurt God.  After all, Trump has a hard time distinguishing himself from God.
Oh absolutely, Sky.  Here is Biden hurting God... By praying in a Christian Church...
Unfortunately, America is as sexist as it is racist. Hopefully, this decision goes well. We know what FN will say. MSM, I guess it depends. Biden and his VP pick need to do lots of in depth interviews. LOTS!

Look up all his racist quotes. There are so many. If Trump said anything close to what Biden does it would run 24-7 for weeks. Never just believe anyone including me. Go to as many sources as you can find. Propaganda is wrapped in truth so you can get truth from the worst news
Go look up Biden's history, especially with race. Ask why he can say Black parents want to take care of their kids they just don't quite no what to do and he would put social workers in their homes in the 2nd primary debate and no one says anything about it.
With a foreign power. Shut out your bias as best you can and explore things. Calling politicians liars has no meaning because they all lie. Biden is a liar. Trump lies. Stop looking at the personalities. Look at legislation. Majority of Dems voted for all Trump's legislative.
Do you not remember when Trump banned travel from China Nancy Pelosi went to Chinatown and encouraged everyone to come on out because it was safe. They said Trump was racist to stop travel from China. Remember Biden encouraging everyone to go vote in Florida. Poll workers sick.
Everyone take this in, it doesn’t matter that both sides are trying to fuck you with no lubeAs long as you remove Trump so Biden can fuck you too. #oops #BLM #nohomo4me

Yeh.Yeh. Biden is at least 10x smarter, coherent, honest, alert, better educated than trump could hope for.  So trump just lies &amp; says he's a genius. College professors remember him as uniquely mediocre &amp; unmemorable for anything else. One Wharton prof. called him lazy.
My mom is a democrat but like the kind that is *very* excited for Joe Biden, ugh 😑
I bet she   dont have an issue at all with the teachers unions going all in for democrats. They are keeping schools closed because of "covid" so teachers can stay home and campaign and fill out fraudulent ballots for Biden. Ask her about that.
For every one you’ve got of Biden, we have a hundred for Trump.
Trump doesn't want Mail In voting to happen, because he knows that more people will be able to vote that way, and a larger turnout is typically better for Democratic candidates (Joe Biden in this case). He can't say that though, so instead he's claiming that it'll lead to fraud.
Yes I’m a Biden supporter and have several police friends.
He’s spent his life abusing his political career to become a millionaire, further promote racial division w his crime bill &amp; other radical “policies”, sold out this nation to terrorist countries, spy on the US citizens &amp; more. Biden &amp; Harris are treasonous, racist democRATS.
Of course Joe Biden is Catholic.   Promoting far-right Catholics — the type that regularly attack Pope Francis — and their conspiracy theories as “some people say...” is bad journalism.

There should be an ad asking republicans why they are voting for Biden...
Biden/Harris administration is a justified hierarchy✊✊
Same reply she got from someone else... And Trump supporters are the sheep 😂 Either a bot or she just  enjoys plagiarism like old Joe.
Too late. I’m very concerned. Tuesday was so full of hope and joy with Biden’s pick. But by Wednesday it was back to a total shit show. I feel that the Dem leadership is still playing by the rules while T has been “there aren’t any f’in rules”. And the R’s are MIA.
Would you like to know how many right wing justices Biden helped get into the Supreme Court?
So like I said, I’m not going to vote for trump. But Biden has done nothing to try and get any part of me to vote for him. He himself has already bred hate into his message when he said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. He said he has no sympathy for my generation.
Well I’ve lost faith in this country years ago. It’s obvious it isn’t working, look at the pain in the country. Trump is only making the weaknesses more apparent as he actively tries to make everything worse. I’d say by them pushing Biden, it secured my doubt in the Dem party.
Our country somehow made the worst mistake they could to promote this man. I know that of everyone who ran Pete and Biden couldn’t handle what’s happening. Biden being notoriously hard on crime is abominable for our situation we are in. Is trump better? No, they are both trash.
A Biden presidency! We got a taste of it 4 yrs ago
Is taylor truly this uninformed or just a complete sellout?  Biden is the one pushing mail-in voting. I’m ‘WELL AWARE’ that you have no idea what you are talking about.
Sounds like a great endorsement for Biden/Harris to me.

Biden will be answering plenty of questions after he is officially nominated by his party. At least we know we will get truths and not fabricate lies like we do with Trump. What good is having a press conference if all you get for answers is lies?
Joe Biden's a joke.
If we compare the ratio or lies from Kamala, Biden, and Trump... Who had the highest proportion of lies to truths?
Harris, Biden and their ilk aren't progressives.   is a right-wing conservative.
Already making up excuses for a Biden loss
My point, if you haven't gotten it yet, is you are STRIVING to perpetuate a system that creates monsters like trump, McConnell, et al. Biden is part of that system. So was Clinton. So was Obama. So was Bush, the other Clinton, the other Bush, etc. So is trump.  We have to change.

How many more is he going to magically scrape from his pool of voters? And think of all the ones he’s lost already. Think of the Republicans and independents who voted for him in 2016, who are going public that they will vote for Biden. Your candidate is in trouble.
Biden isn't even campaigning. His surrogates aren't doing anything either. I live in a purple town that leans heavily blue. I haven't seen one sign or sticker for Biden. Not one. Trump wins in a landslide.
Right so why is Biden advocating for a national mask mandate that makes no sense for large parts of the country?
So the new strategy is to congratulate leftists for getting Kamala Harris on the ticket (????) by pretending that “close to M4A” is progressive and invoking the GND (which Biden, the presidential candidate with fossil fuel execs on his team, still opposes)
I’ve seen thousands of Trump flags....still haven’t seen a Biden flag....
You mean: Trump plans to hit Biden in the only way he thinks he can as a last resort.
I definitely don’t like Trump. Kamala might secure the win for Biden though.
There is zero chance I will vote for Biden, because his record is an abomination to anyone who supports consent, is anti war, and stands firmly with defunding the police.
Can Trump be removed from office as soon as he gets voted out?  What would need to happen for Biden to take over immediately?
Rump could have lawyers intervene to try to deny extensions but I don't see his lawyers succeeding. They can also intervene in the case of close votes and recounts, or if there is provable major fraud. As long as we give Biden a blowout victory, Rump is toast.
Because lies are all Republicans got.

He’s actually right. I live in Kentucky, a red state. I have friends who are conservative Republicans and my friends are not voting for Trump. Five out of six are voting for Biden. I have another friend who has never voted for anybody in his life, he’s voting for Biden.
Hating poor people and letting them die is literally Biden's entire record, but go off.  This is a weird defense a New Jim Crow segregationist.
That’s the best you could do?? 1975. Biden made racist comments literally 7 days ago. Not to mention his long long history of same.
Perhaps, because, at that moment, she had center stage &amp; his mind was on what she's saying? It's called respect...dignity...INTEGRITY. I knew at the outset "a certain class of people" would see an opp to try to make Biden look bad. But Truth Will Always Be Stronger Than Lies
I’m really annoyed with the lefts stance of “don’t publicly question Biden/Harris until after they are elected!”  What? That’s how bad our democracy is now?
Right. Trump &amp; Biden are both shitty but a third party candidate has no chance of winning.
Actually, Biden is a well-educated gentleman with a law degree (not to mention a serious christian upbringing). Trump was a mediocre student outstanding only by virtue of his mediocrity. Biden stays mentally active  but Trump, morbidly obese, his mouth is his most active quality.
I am so ready for you to be Biden's AG and charge him.
yeah good luck getting biden to pass m4a. good luck abolishing capitalism from within capitalism (the only way to possibly divert the climate crisis). also love the just straight up right wing bullshit ‘communists have no job’ that’s literally 100% baseless...
They can't do it the next day.  But the longer Biden remains POTUS (shudder) the bigger danger he becomes.  This moron with the nuclear football?  He could flashback to the cuban missile crisis and launch.
Look people who never voted before have registered to vote. Droves of Republicans are leaving the party &amp; are voting for Biden. Trump has disenfranchised millions &amp; millions of Americans. They are ready to vote like never before. Unless Russia performs a miracle DT won’t win.
Called the Biden/Kamala ticket in July 2019. Just call me votestradamus.
Excellent, as usual. The Harris pick by Biden did nothing to change my mind about who to vote for. It's still 3rd party for me.
President Biden will do. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020 #TrumpDeathToll170K #MoroninChief
Completely missing the point. Biden should start holding weekly press conferences so he doesn't look like a weak old man.
High praise Rick. Your  blazed the trail for more and more talented, media savvy compatriots to join the fight. I'm glad the Biden campaign has found some top-shelf SocMed talent.
If progressives/leftists are not voting Biden, I wonder if they realize you can't seriously push progressive priorities in a crumbled nation that would result after four more years of Trump. Nobody will be talking #MedicareForAll while fending off fascist hit squads (e.g.).

Did Harris get Biden fired from the television show that he created? It's a lot easier to forgive a few mean words in a debate than that.  Besides, it's a tweet, he's not standing outside the guys house challenging him to a duel. Don't be so judgmental.
While like many other progressives I see Biden as having done very little to win me over on policy, I am becoming increasingly convinced Biden is in this to win it. I am pleasantly surprised with this aspect. #BidenHarris2020
Thank you for your service Mr. Biden your service is invaluable to the trump administration to give them the easiest election in history
I'm voting a straight Republican ballot Mr. Biden.
Team Trump released their first ad about the new ticket. In it, the campaign declares their new nicknames for the Biden-Harris ticket, “Slow Joe” and “Phony Kamala.”   What other nicknames are fitting for these misfits?

China has done us enough harm already in 2020. Time to turn the tables on them which Trump is in the process of doing. Biden will only coddle them like Obama and Clinton did.
The chance that there was a maskless Joe Biden rally in eastern Iowa this week is zero.

Do you think one of those parallels, long experience and relationships in the Senate, gives Biden’s legislative agenda more legs than Obama’s had. So much, I guess, depends on the party composition, but that was always a knock on Obama’s admin, that they struggled on the hill.
I think the author doesn’t understand that Israel will always be supported by the US, but it’s obvious Harris and Biden will be less supportive than Trump
President Trump answers dozens of questions daily from a hostile media.   Biden and Harris have answered no questions from a friendly media since announcing the ticket.   Could it be they have no answers to our countries problems?
Simple, if you're voting for Trump, you only vote once.  If you're voting for Biden, vote as many times as you like.
He is racist. My black friends and neighbors definitely are not all the same. They aren't all Biden voters either. Of course Biden doesn't even think they are black if they don't vote for him.
“Trump is our last hope!” “Biden is the only way to heal this nation.”  Me: “Have you guys heard of Jesus?” “He’s eternal and conquered death. He’s God incarnate.”
What is sad is my black neighbors are scared too? I hear all the time how they want the police here. But, we all know that there won't be enough of them and our Mayor and Governor want the violence. Never let people like Joe Biden tell you all black people are the same.

Ooo, sweet burn, bro. Even tho Biden and Harris gave speeches 2 days ago, the day after he announced Harris would be his VP. Not in his basement.
That’s his point I think. If Democrats start acting like an opposition party for once they’ll  beat him pretty handily. 2 1/2 months should be enough time. Just don’t let Trump, who’s willing to run left of Biden on issues to win, actually run left of Biden. I would love to 1/

Facts lmaoooo like I would hate to be Joe Biden bc this is EMBARRASSING 🤣 Trump dragging him in memes lol
It's outrageous that Biden's father &amp; brother didn't step in to make sure he got into an Ivy League school. Didn't they know Penn was taking 1/2 of all applicants back then?
are you such a binary thinker that you believe if I say biden and harris are shit, i must think trump isn't shit?   what a brainlet reply
What's Biden saying the under his breath at the end?
no its a completely terrible analogy. there are 0 redeeming qualities of biden or kamala, and pretending there are is buffoonery
That's a direct quote from Biden, goof
Joe Biden is definitely senile.
I am more/less on the same page as Cornel West. I'm not endorsing Biden-Harris, but I am voting for them. One of the top orders of business we progressives/leftists have is anti-fascism. And that's why we're voting to remove Rump. But we're not done once Rump is gone.
Not even Biden is pretending like he's going for a second tern and has basically saidbas much, I know he said he "isn't ruling it out" but he pretty much has to say that.  Every indication is that he will serve one term, if that.
I listened to future president Biden. Not one time did he say any of this! Wake up America our President is a narrassis liar.
It is hilarious to me every time a Republican cites the current situation in America as a reason not to vote for #BidenHarris2020. Hey morons, that’s WHY we want to vote for Biden!
Only if trusted Medical Professionals agree that a vaccine is safe.  If Dr Fauci agrees I will.  I trust Joe Biden as well because he will listen to Fauci or other trusted Medical Professionals.  When Trump has his "October Surprise" and announces a vaccine, the answer is NO.
As a former Republican....Go Biden!!! Go Harris!!!
But neither Biden nor Harris are socialists....? What are you going on about?
Biden got angry when Trump began shutting off travel a little at a time as the Caronavirus first spread, in hindsight he says Trump was too slow to act. Which is it Slow Joe ?
Another term of Trump destroys what's left of the country, so we progressives won't have anything to fix at that point. We're just going to have to suck it up and install Biden. And we'll have to hound him into the ground.
this is America if #trump is re-elected. Vote Biden/Harris 2020 'It's like a war': beatings and indiscriminate arrests as armed men roam streets of Minsk
Like I said, #MeToo died with
It would be good if the Governor would endorse the Biden/Harris ticket.
Biden should say thanks but no thanks right now.
At this rate we'll be *lucky* if we get to cast a vote for Joe Biden.
The new NPR poll has Biden up by 11 points. This is an absolute disconnect from reality.
👏 “Religious voters” 👏 are 👏 diverse👏 and 👏 aren’t 👏 uniformly 👏 conservative. 👏   For example: Biden leads Trump 92-5 among Black Protestants.   Everyone who shapes our public discourse about religion and politics needs to reflect the diversity. ( data)
I think another question that needs to be asked is why are we seeing this and other unflattering pics of Biden at all? Who is leaking them? Why now? Small crowds everywhere he goes, the handler running reporters out of the room after one question? WTF is really going on here?

Just ordered a "Number 46" sticker from the Biden merch store and it occurred to me:  I probably won't be around long enough for President Number 69. Which makes me sad because the jokes and memes about that would be NICE
to talking about the #TrumpVirusCatastrophe and Trump/Pence plan to double down vs Biden/Harris plan to #BuildBackBetter works for All AMERICANS!
Trump hangs his changeup. Biden’s slider has no bite. Definitely  when the game’s on the line
I understand the reasoning for Bloomberg and Kasich speaking at the convention, but we need to hear people that have something iimportant to say as well. Not just just the money man and a guy who may bring some Republicans to vote for Biden.
Because the democratic party rallied against the scary man who was gaining steam and would have shook things up considerably. Biden isn't the best candidate at all. He's just all that's left.
What are vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris' views on the Middle East?
Sen. Ron Johnson says his probe of Obama-era intelligence agencies will help President Donald Trump win reelection, an explicit admission he’s using his committee to damage Joe Biden's candidacy for president.  via
So isn't the strategy to disenfranchise cities by making it harder to vote there (less polling places due to covid) and thereby increase his odds in swing states dramatically? Whatever polling advantage Biden has will shrink if city dwellers can't vote.
Trump is committing election fraud by suppressing our votes. First time an American President did this &amp; so blatantly. 🍊🚿Compromised Russian asset was an illegitimate president &amp; now he will cheat again to win. By some off chance Biden wins, we must make sure we #ProsecuteTrump
Net zero by 2050? Why not, many people now say. Via ⁦
I'm not making it political, I'm just stating facts. America has endured world wars, terrorist attacks, segregation, civil war, assassination, impeachments, etc.  We have endured.  This narrative that Biden being elected will destroy America is out of touch with American History.
American politics, like our national life, is upside down and backward this year. Schools aren’t able to open, college football won’t be played, and former Republicans are working to defeat incumbent senators of their old party.  via
BBB  Biden: 3 Trump: 0
he made them feel uncomfortable "after receiving unwanted touching".  That's called sexual harassment.  I know it's hard to keep up with your own hypocrisy, but do try to keep up.

People Left Baffled By Katie Holmes’ Bizarrely Suggestive Photo To Celebrate The Biden/Harris Ticket
Liar lair pants on fire.    Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Public universities: America's best idea?  "[A] hodgepodge of souls who are working toward what is incidentally at the heart of every election: a fair chance at a decent life."
I understand this. I agree it won’t happen under Biden, we have to look beyond this election cycle. I am literally about as far left as one could be politically, but unless there’s a full blown revolution it won’t happen in 2020. We must act with foresight.
We need to bide our time and hold out. We can push while Biden’s President; let dem voters know “hey this isn’t too much change is it?” The alternative to Biden Kamala is much worse in my opinion, and I’m not sure we’d get through it peacefully.
Agreed. Biden/Kamala must win for us to have a chance to sway Dem voters. If they lose the DNC will move right and Bernie’s progress will have been for nothing.
Exactly, they’d rather lose with Biden than win with Bernie
Do you not understand that Trump will REVERSE ALL THE PROGRESS WE’VE MADE. Maybe Biden won’t push us forward, but he won’t openly bring out racism and fascism as well as dismantling USPS, Medicare, social security, national parks, etc.
I agree in sentiment, but this election is different. Trump is openly dismantling all the socialists progress we’ve made. He’ll see the end to Social Security, Medicare/caid, libraries, USPS, publi utilities and LGBT+ progress. A Biden admin wouldn’t do this.
We need to vote out Trump this November. Vote Kamala and Biden and we can at least have the possibility of moving the country left. Without them, Trump could do unknown atrocities. People advocating AGAINST Biden/Kamala are doing so from a place of privilege.
Which will be the first time a man with dementia will get the nomination of the democratic party.  Voting for Biden is doom for our country and our freedoms.
He can say all he wants, I'm not voting for Biden ever
WATCH: Biden's Handlers Kick Reporters Out Of Press Briefing After They Start Asking Questions
Joe Biden is fake. His speeches are fake. His hair is fake. His intentions and soul are counterfeit.
I am Republican and will vote for Biden and Harris 2020!
This isn't funny guys. Biden is obviously senile &amp; someone needs to check him into an old folk's home.
WOW a Senile joe Biden idea! Did he need a script like he did when he called Harris with his cell phone upside down? Look below this may happen!
Republicans are attacking your social security and medicare by cutting the payroll tax! Be warned! Vote Biden and Harris to keep your social security!
Enough of THIS. Biden 2020.
He’s a crook. He admitted to committing election fraud which is a federal crime! We must indict this SOB if he pulls this through and Biden wins by some miracle!
If you can vote for a pro war pro increased police funding candidate, you have to be white, and probably a woman. They are safe from Biden.
Hope? Hope for what? That Biden demands Alyssa Milano's career be saved/ resurrected??  America isn't exactly interested in a Charmed or Who's the Boss reboot.
Fact check: Trump promotes another birther lie, this time about Kamala Harris
Morals, honestly and the belief in science. Joe Biden and Harris 2020 will beat the pandemic. Dump Donald Trump and all of the controversy he has caused over the last last four years.
Now do Biden.

All the more reason for us to get an overwhelming voter turnout and elect Biden.

Our children are watching America. Biden 2020.
Are we not doing Bi for Biden?
Of course there are. Biden supporters need to be getting on the phone, knocking on doors, and just in general showing some enthusiasm for their guy. It’s pathetic and lazy to see only attempts at shaming. The fact is many voters see that the two party system has all but given 1/
Evangelicals for Biden 2020 because morals and truth matter.
Biden and Harris. Build back better with Biden 2020.
Evangelicals for Biden 2020. Morals and the truth matters.
I’m sure you haven’t listened to Pelosi or Schumer. And no real exam of Joe Biden and his sexist / rasist comments I’m sure!
I picked trump would win in 2016, I suspect Biden will in 2020.
I’ve been all for Bernie but I voted for Clinton in 16. I have volunteered my time and money to multiple progressive campaigns. I give a shit about my state and want better for it. So can someone from Biden’s campaign tell me why I should vote for him?
My vote means shit. If I lived in a swing state maybe I’d be persuaded that Trump is the lesser of two evils. But Kentucky isn’t vote by mail yet and Covid exists. What is Biden doing that makes me want to take a risk for him? He sure as hell hasn’t taken a single risk for me.
The rapist and the transphobe or the rapist and the transphobe?  Back when Booker was in the race I probably would’ve voted for Biden since I was already there. But as a resident of Kentucky where Trump won by literally 30 points what the fuck is the point of me voting this year?
Now do Biden’s son. Seriously you are a fool.
The pandemic did this not them your past actions will take u down we already see it all over internet why is that coward bIDEN HIDING  YRYING TO AVOID DEBATES HED A SCAREDY CAT
What did Obama/Biden do about it ?
My sister and I were talking about how disappointing it is that  isn’t our nominee. We’re still going to vote for Biden and Harris but our hearts will always be with Elizabeth Warren. I trust she will be a force for good in the Senate after we sweep #MoscowMitch out.
👇🏻 by what mystical power are the disenfranchised meant to “hold them accountable?” When has this ever happened? What possible reason would Biden/Harris have for listening to radical demands AFTER receiving the mandate to rule, if they don’t even care now?
Preface this by saying I’m an independent. Trump has major character flaws. Biden clearly has something going on. It’s gonna be a shit show. Depending on media sway- this virus and/or social unrest may disappear by November.
Right, like Hunter Biden? Nice try!
Tucker is the angry and unhinged face of the Republican party.   Biden and Harris are mature and balanced and are ready to lead America out of the dark days of Donald J Trump.
Political fear mongering is a tactic used when you're losing on the issues.   America, we are losing over 1,000 patriotic Americans a day from the coronavirus under   watch. Keep that in mind when you're voting for Joe Biden 2020. The truth and morals matter.
Biden is going to take your guns, no, wait, your God, no, its even worse!  He’s going to take your steaks!!!  How can the Onion even compete with this!?
Translation:  Biden wants to save American lives.  Trump doesn't care about anything but his reelection.
Dammit!  You can read me so well.  But in the socialist hellscape I am hoping Biden-Harris implement, I would get rid of the internet and give that money to all the poors, amirite?
The world is laughing now. Joe Biden will be a great president.
Not enough. I want a Biden victory of historical proportions. I want him to embarrass Trump.

Joe Biden doesn’t pronounce her name right!! Who are you kidding
Yes, but are they campaign speeches FOR BIDEN??? He's sweaty, drowsy, and slurring. Does he think this will get the swing voter thinking, "Oh yeah, this guy should have 4 more years."
Joe Biden demands you wear a mask while eating. 😷🤣😂
Damn straight I'm proudly supporting them. ALL IN. Biden wasn't my choice but Harris for VP was. She will help him win like no other. Electing them will enable progressive policy conversations. 3rd party votes will NOT, &amp; will help Trump literally continue to kill like no other
Der Fuhrer Joe Biden can't even talk, he must be in the midst of senile authoritarian daydream with his imaginary dictatorial national mask mandate.
Joe Biden is a joke.
Gee, I must have missed it when Biden got promoted to King of America.
Joe Biden would pee in the lemonade, forget his just did and drink a cup.
Probably all Biden voters if they even vote at all.
As Ali Velshi just said, Pence is afraid Joe Biden is going to take his rump roast
I can't believe this is 2020! Thx #tRump for putting all those racists in the open!
Do you want little girls to rub it on their head first Joe Biden
Who said I was voting for Biden?
This is rich. One minute Biden isn’t taking the virus seriously, the next he’s so serious about it he’s taking measures to prevent it regardless of the economic impact.
Silly Biden, wearing a mask months before Trump because he didn’t take the virus seriously.
Biden's out there and nobody knows quite where.
I wish I could play roulette next to Joe Biden, I could make a fortune betting red into his black.
I believe this is rather disrespectful &amp; perhaps libelous to Sen. Harris. (Seen on her FB page &amp; Joe Biden's.)  Do you condone this?
I'm a leftist that will be voting for Biden, because I genuinely believe that we will not survive another 4 years of Trump.
Public policy for Biden/Harris.  Unofficial adviser.  Always persists - and dumping Trump is the most righteous fight yet.
enthusiasm for Biden wasn’t great from the beginning...Harris polled at 1% before she dropped out. They’ve had the media, Hollywood, sports, big banks etc. on their side the entire time. He could def lose...but truly think they’ll do ANYTHING to keep him from winning
I hope kamala Harris and Biden clean trump out of office
Twitter Followers:  Joe  Biden              8.3 million  Kamala Harris        4.8 million   Donald J Trump.   85.1 million   That’s my tweet
Biden is a better candidate than Hillary with Independents and bette with black voters (who won him the Primary)  He will he enough to win absent a major change
The GOP didn’t support Trump in 2016...many boycotted the convention   But they voted for him just as Dems will for Biden
Looking a like like 2016 with Biden winning popular by 3-4 pts but losing EC. 🤞🤞
I think Biden is going to win....but I acknowledge this possibility that Trump could still win in a surprise as he did in 2020  It shocks me how many Trump supporters refuse to even acknowledge the possibility he could lose. It is really crazy
Guys, I absolutely can not.   The Biden/Kamala supporters are crawling through the woodworks to assure me that if I don’t vote for them, I’m secretly against trans people.   Yes. Me and my trans best friend, who both hate Biden, hate trans individuals. The secrets are out. 🧐👌
Biden and Harris will lock you up for not wearing a mask alone in the woods. Meanwhile the rest of the Democrats won’t lock people up for anything , except self defense.
Biden has zero power. Biden lives in a basement. Trump will win re-election. You will cry.
Didn’t think I could hate Hiden Biden as much tell he farted in his own mouth and let this sh;t roll out
Kamala and Joe want our money to fill their own pockets. They will raise taxes and use the money to cut deals with corporations in order to get kickback's. If you want to keep the money you earn, vote Trump/Pence. If you want the government to blow your 💰, vote Harris/Biden! 🇺🇲
If religious voters were sitting on the fence before Biden made his VP pick then they were morons. The race and any mandate will be delivered by the excitement and turn out of the base, not the extent to which Harris appeases religious fence sitters. Go for the low hanging fruit.
Yeah I just had a swab stuck in my brain because of you, Biden, Bill Gates, I could go on and on
Now do Joe Biden
Even Joe Biden called her that during the debates 🤦‍♀️
He was right—travel bans didn’t stop the virus.
Why does FOX News show Biden's and Trump's speeches, and CNN &amp; MSNBC only show Biden. This should be obvious to every American that CNN &amp; MSNBC are Bias. If enough people in this country is that ignorant, we are in trouble. How can u vote for someone that won't answer questions?!
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate &gt;&gt;
Don’t vote for Biden then. We’re all in for Stacie.  Damn you’re lucky.  She usually tells y’all to fk right off.
People are fools to hold the President responsible for the economy, post Pandemic. If we want to get back to where we were, we better vote Trump. It's crazy to let China destroy our country in order to get Joe Biden elected. It's definitely what they want. Say no to China Joe! 🇺🇲
I’m not backing Biden or Harris, but it’s time we become realists.
And you know that how? Do you have proof?  Just keep talking guys with unsubstantiated bs he’s going to get the elected it doesn’t matter who Biden has as a vp all that is way to the left I am American and plan on stayi ng that way!
so do you believe Biden's accusers or not?  Oh that's right, the #MeToo and #believeallwomen movements ended when  got the nomination.
I did the same a while back, I even un followed some people because following them had Biden and others popping up in my timeline constantly. And while we get bored/distracted truly NOTHING else matters but Christ and witnessing to the lost. God's got the rest under control.🙏❤️

Welllllll, Biden did say everyone should wear masks for the next 3 months with no explanation and took no questions. So that's kinda leadership.....if you're a fucking idiot.
Biden is a transitional candidate don't expect too much from Him Harris and who she chooses as a Running mate in 4yrs is where the Medicare for all conversation begins shes for it ! .Biden will step down after 2-3yrs more than likely ..
What... Do you you have a hard time understanding that with Harris and Biden we're moving closer to Medicare for all even if it comes from the next president after Biden . But if Trump elected we'll move further RIGHT as a country and won't get Medicare for all PERIOD!
No shit but Biden will do 2-3Yrs and hand it off to Harris, the next president will be able to be more progressive after that . It's a slow progression .but if Trump is elected then no we'll move further from Medicare for all. Does that make sense ?
Trump Kamala Harris Biden Pence Gun girl Ben Sharpio Tomi Lahren  (If Twitter was Deathnote) ❤️
I doubt Biden will do that but even if he did Trump is still screwed at the NY state level.
Why is it that Harris/Biden campaign not have to take QUESTIONS! How will they deal with China, Russia, Iran, and even the American People. This is dangerous. Who are you really voting for, if you chose these 2 Idiots. Pitiful!
I’m really on Twitter shamelessly shitting on Kamala and Biden while desperately debating people on Facebook to not throw away their vote on a symbolic gesture w a third party candidate bc RBG’s replacement depends on it.
I used to be critical of Kamala Harris. Now I am going to defend her at every turn | Shanita Hubbard
And before you say "uh vote him out in November," remember that he is trying to make that completely impossible. What are you going to do when he steals the election? Are Biden/Harris gonna give some weak concession speech and ride off to collect speakers' fees?
It is lame. The more they attack Harris the better off Biden and Democrats are. It will not sour non-white voters who already see Trump for the racist pig that he is. Ultimately, attacking Harris will look like misogyny and turn off the white suburbanites Trump covets.
I'm as left as we can get, but I'm pulling for Biden/Harris just like I pulled for Clinton/Kaine.  I like our chances this time around. I'm not trying to win the world-- just trying to get my foot on solid ground.
You mean, Biden gets the one without pictures in it?!
“Taking away votes from Joe Biden” a hilarious phrase cuz the only thing taking away votes from Joe Biden is Joe Biden being Joe Biden
I don't want a Racist President, that's why I will not vote Biden/Harris! That will put 2 racists in the Whitehouse! 🇺🇲🦅⚖️🐘
I have faith that the vast majority of Americans do not want our Great Country to be run, I mean Ruined, like San Francisco, or California. That's what we'll get if Biden/Harris win. Cities in debt, tents, homelessness, drugs, in every street of America. I Pray not.

Here’s an idea, if you feel meh about Biden and Harris but want Trump out, slow your roll and maybe Biden will actually make an effort to campaign.
Retweet have Biden and Harris use this song for campaign videos.
This may be premature, but if Biden gets elected, we need to seriously push our govt to pay the first lady. I'm sure Mr. Kamala Harris is nice, but I know some fool is gonna wanna give him a First Man salary in 2024, and if that happens we will rage! #FLOTUS #PayJill #paygap

You are so wrong. Biden will straighten out the mess you have made with our allies while you cower to Putin. It’s so strange how you admire and fear Putin at the same time . N Korea  has more weapons since you entered office Iran closer to a nuclear weapon. You’ve made a mess!!!!
How many women has  fucked, abused, attacked &amp; paid off to win be POTUS?Ask yourself that  Last count was over 20 with 2 in lawsuits with him right now. I pray  pulls the same stunt showing America ALL 20 on national TV like Trump did w/Clinton
Why not just say "if Biden gets elected the world will blow up."? More fear is produced and it's just as big a lie as any of the others he tells.
I don't want to see either of them.  Both are abominations.   But, I feel trump is far worse.  He is worse as a human being, he is worse for the nation, he is worse for democracy.   I don't support Biden because trump is worse.  I don't support Biden period.
Yeah but with Biden being sick do you really want this loser to run our country??

If Donald Trump’s gambit to defund the post office so we can’t have mail-in voting fails, he will slash the ink budget so there isn’t enough to put Joe Biden’s name on the ballot.
I think the Biden campaign wishes the You Ain't Black episode would go away, but this kind of 'support' for the campaign extends that message. I don't understand your reference to a 'messenger' but I do know Mr Arthur. He's not posing or playing a role.
The best gift Biden gave Trump was picking this POS as VP.
Thing is you guys have alienated good people within your own party. I have lifelong conservative Republican friends here in Kentucky who will not vote for Trump. 4/5 are voting for Biden.
Y’all remember when Tulsi Gabbard destroyed Kamala Harris so badly that she had to end her presidential campaign and go into hiding for 6 months? That is Joe Biden’s pick for VP 🤦🏼‍♂️ wtf is happening?

Don't worry we'll have a few chances during Biden's reign
Totally true.  However, I think one of the left's principles is anti-fascism, and we have a fascist to remove from office. After we accomplish that, we can be as harsh on Biden as we so choose.
Biden can't talk
I won’t forget. And it won’t stop me from voting Biden/Harris.  Enough of the shit show - Trump’s make America Great Again is a joke.
Anyone that falls for this Biden/Harris narrative that our economy is a wreck because of Trump's handing of the China Virus is ignorant. First of all, our economy was the best ever, before the virus. 2nd, our economy is coming back quicker than anyone thought.

So vote for Biden and Kamala. Vote for forward thinking leadership.
Neither Biden nor Harris are far-left &amp; your attempt to label them as such is ludicrous. Aren't y'all afraid of the whole world laughing at you and your whiny leader yet?  Biden has plans and all tRump has are Twitter tirades. Toothless EOs &amp; racist meltdowns are all he has.
Biden said he was going to serve only one term. She is in line for that top job! 💛🐝
I think because our economies have a symbiotic relationship, there will never be s war between China and the US. I do think they need to open the country more to foreign investment. If Biden becomes president, he should stay strong on them, and force them to open their markets.
When Herman Cain heard the Joe Biden had picked Kamala Harris as his running mate....
13 days after his death, Herman Cain 'tweets' about Biden-Harris
Lets begin too #BuildBackBetter with our #VoteBidenHarris2020 huge turnout. We can afford 4 more years dealing with the #TrumpVirusCatastrophe with climbing #TrumpVirusDeathToll165K this really is a vote for LIFE or DEATH! trump #HeWentToJared Biden/Harris will GO WITH SCIENCE
The fact that  Biden’s government is what so many want is just sickening. I wonder how far down this path they will take us before they start crying for help?
why don't you want Biden to debate Trump?  What are you afraid of?
so what are you gonna do?  Stay in the basement?
I'm surprised this is still up.
do you still stand by this?
she thinks you are a sexual predator.
so do you still believe his accusers or not?
So do you still believe  accusers or no?
This is to Devin Nunes tweet. We were following you all around the world trying to dig up dirt on Biden. You found nothing.  You spent tax payers $ to do dispicable things. You were sent to DC to help your community. You haven't done that.  You are corrupt just like Trump
We need Biden to put it on the line and have a debate with President Trump before anyone can vote!
she thinks you are a sexual predator.  How's that gonna work out?
I see how this works.  You believe Trump's accusers but not Biden's.  And yes, Kamala said she believed Biden's accusers.  Do you even remember?  Probably not.  Refresh your memory here.
Thanks for the warning. I will be setting up my Biden/Harris 2020 action plan.
HIstory often repeats itself and Joe Biden is no exception
You realize the last thing you see on this is Biden’s name for about 20 seconds, while yours appears for what, like 2? Pretty lame, bud.
The only memories shorter than Biden’s are those of the rest of the left.
Well unless Biden/Harris win this is still America. If you don't want to watch you don't have to waste your time watching anything.
Debates are not useless, especially when o e sides candidate has 40 yrs of nothing to run on, and cant even remember what office he is running for and the other gets wall to wall biased coverage agains him on msm.  Plus...poll numbers are closing on Biden
#TrumpVirusCatastrophe due to the fact that #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks #TrumpGolfsAmericansDie    the same that said 2 Ebola Deaths were a failure is now SILENT ON #TrumpVirusDeathToll165K and climbing! Obama/Biden turned to Science results 2
Under Obama/Biden Ebola reached our Nation claims Two Americans lives and  went crazy said they failed! Under Trump/Pence #Coronavirus appeared  called it a "Hoax" began too Lie Americans began DYING. Trump errands it to #TrumpVirus it then becomes

I don’t disagree, Donald Trump has nothing to do with a Biden/Harris ticket be considerable. You even admitted that Biden just absolutely will win your state so you’re making a “principled” decision of endorsement... I don’t see how Biden/Harris could be palatable for you
I’m no fan of Biden as well.
In what world is Biden/Harris an option?
Why are they speaking? Isn’t he suppose to be running against Trump and Biden?? Oh ya that’s right he’s only trying to beat Biden. My bad, I forgot.
I guess I missed the part where he was cheering for Biden. Criticism on the “president” is not an endorsement for anyone else.

No need for a boost, just wanna join in the fun...Fuck Joe Biden!
I think she is more right wing than centrist.  Biden for sure is.
Harris is such a good VP pick that she kinda over shadows Biden, I'm excited about Harris being president
No. Sleep. Till Biden.
I can't wait to vote for Joe Budden and Kamala Harris! Oh, sorry, his name is Joe Biden? Well, who is he?
Former Bernie Sanders Press Secretary on the Biden/Harris ticket.
Q Patriots invade congressional races and win; Biden has a racism problem.
Threatened by Kamala. His remark that Biden’s choice for VP was an insult to men everywhere was actually an insult to women who are fighting for equality.Women have proven their ability to perform most any job a man does, from jet pilot to astronaut, Senator, boxer, doctor + mom.
Trump didn’t sleep with his bosses to gain promotions. And we’re not talking about Kampala’s husband are we?  And do we want to start with Biden’s sexual harassment allegations?  Oh, that’s right, we don’t believe women accusers when the perpetrator is Democrat. #MeToo    Silence
Biden needs to put trump over his lap pull trumps britches down &amp; give the fat ole orange guy a good ass whipping spanking 👍

You need to support Biden /Harris ticket and quickly.
Oh, the toxic Biden bros and KHive are just so mean and uncompromising. Just can’t vote for them because of. Nothing to do with decades of killing poor people. We can all agree that targeting poor Americans is excusable. Just the toxic fan base. Big meanies. #Khive #BidenBros

I posted Biden/Harris on #Facebook and got flagged for harassment or bullying. I challenged the decision and then got banned for 24 hours. Yet I went back to the post and Trump 2020 was all over.  Looks like Facebook is choosing sides

Biden will chew trump up with facts, you know those things that trump hasn't bothered to learn
Now how more niggas gonna know what Kamala Harris did with mass incarceration but still support Biden against Trump?
And Biden is a FRUAD, set his family up to make millions off of China and the Ukraine, so find another agreement if your going to base your case on lies, corruption and screwing people over.
You are so delusional. You talk about Biden mental state. You need to check yourself!!  No one is more delusional than you. Start packing your bags.  Time is up for you!! #dumptrump2020
Biden and Harris didn’t steal from a children’s charity.
I try to understand the frustration of people who don't like Biden/Harris but are voting for them, and I also get the anxiety of the people freaking out that people don't like them and will cause them to lose, we are all in rough shape here.
Somebody knows Biden is in decline. Never thought you'd support socialism Bill. You must be as hollow in your beliefs as Biden and Kamala
Yes, I have, have you? The very idea that the attack ah#gainst Biden is going to be his mental acuity with the orange dipshit in the White House is laughable 🙄
Not everybody even gets to fuckin vote lmao!! Like!!!!!!!! And we ~HAVE~ to choose Biden....just like we HAD to choose Hillary.....THIS IS OUR FUCKING COUNTRY TF!!!! WE DO NOT HAVE TO DO SHIT!!!!!!
I actually feel enthusiasm about voting for Biden now. Biden, and Harris.

Because he hates trump and he wants Biden to win.
People bringing up all the dirt on Kamala and Biden like a literal racist who has done worse things isn’t in office and overtly showed us this before claiming his position.  WHO TF ARE YALL TRYING TO PROTECT, TRUMP?!?
You’d think that Biden would know how to pronounce his VP’s actual name...maybe the next news conference....in October.
Joe Biden can’t pronounce his running mates first name. He’s such a racist
I don’t understand how boomers can (with a STRAIGHT FACE) accuse me of getting my opinions on Kamala and Biden from Russian bots on Twitter when all they do when they aren’t working is scroll on Facebook and watch MSNBC ALL. DAY. LONG.

Incredible difference listening to Biden and Harris speak, I have absolutely no respect for this current administration!
The guy is literally working with the Trump campaign to siphon votes away from Biden.  I mean that's seriously what his goal is.  Like meeting with Kushner and everything.
congrats on the nomination Mrs. Harris.  I am asking the same question I asked 4 years ago.  I am looking for a person to vote for that I can respect.  You seem to not respect Biden, from comments in this past year.  Why should I vote for the Biden/Harris ticket?
Biden introduces VP choice Harris; much history, no crowd &gt;&gt;
Obama tried to destroy the USA and Biden was too dumb to say anything.  Biden a career politician who hasn’t accomplished a thing.

I need to know who Joe Biden’s tailor is.
A new mayor isnt going to solve hundreds of years of racial oppression and the issues in the criminal justice system.Even the voters don't believe that or else they would vote these people out!Trump trying to simply stop the looting or protesting won't solve anything. Biden 2020

Oh geez you’re so right I better not vote for Biden hmmm let’s look at the rest of the ballot
It is hard to watch Trump speak, after watching the fast articulating, motivating, positive speech of Biden and Harris!
You’ve been rallying behind Biden since the beginning. They really think they can outsmart us with mind games, and it makes me want to really show them how little their vote means without young Black voters behind them.
“Nothing will fundamentally change” -Joe Biden. What are you expecting to happen in his administration? Working class will continue to suffer, war will continue to rage. Some people will just feel better, but the state of the nation will not “fundamentally change”
Does she still believe Biden’s accuser of sexual assault?! Not now I guess.
Here comes the blame game ALREADY, so they have someone to yell at when Biden loses (as if he wasn’t going to anyways).
We have bigger issues Biden/Harris2020
I just watched Biden/Harris and it was so refreshing to hear two people who can speak so well while expressing their thoughts. It took me back to Pres. Clinton and Pres. Obama. Instead of numb nuts...
5. Neither were my absolute top pick for President or Vice President. Today’s speech did help me get excited for the ticket though. The Biden/Harris ticket seems to have more energy and charisma than the Clinton/Kaine ticket.
While Biden and Harris did let Trump have it, they also gave ideas on what a Biden Presidency night look like and I was on board with having a Biden Presidency listen to the scientists about Covid.
As evidenced during the VP debate in 2016.   3. Both speeches from Biden and Harris were empathetic, detailed, and tough on Trump when needed.   4. Clinton was criticized for focusing her campaign on solely being the anti Trump candidate.
I need that....To hear someone speak that is really capable of leadership. We are hungry for that. No lies and pulling a rabbit out of his ass like somebody else I know. Preach Biden  and K Harris. We can not deny the fact that that news briefing was right on point
A few things from Biden and Harris’s speech today.   1. They have great chemistry together. That was something I didn’t think that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has exactly.   2. Harris will be an attack dog VP candidate. Kaine struggled with this role
The gaslighting and ignorant “reasoning” my parents are trying to provide on why Biden/Harris is better literally makes me want to vote for Trump JUST so they lose and I can throw it in their faces. (I won’t, but that’s how mentally unbalanced I’m feeling.
2/7 To some, Harris is problematic because her police record doesn't conform to burlesque standards of an acceptable constabulary, and Biden's Senate record categorizes him as a "racist" since he once dared to question the wisdom and utility of busing children.
1/7 The Democrats have quite the wrinkled shirt on their hands. According to Biden, Harris isn't Black (and according to the standards of the left, she is and is not at the same time). According to Harris, Biden is an abuser of women (and an enfeebled man).
Biden/Harris event wraps up with Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" and, politics aside, that's a hot jam for a campaign song.
Did you see those spouses greeting Biden and Harris? We've not ONCE witnessed Melania greet trump with such love and respect. Ever. #BidenHarris2020
It will have to be an unmistakable and slide for Biden to win. Look at the Belarus election. The Russians have a stake in keeping NATO out of Belarus. Lukashenko did NOT get 80% of the vote! #RussianInterference Same thing will play out here in November...
Holy shit, after listen to Biden and Harris  has   Hello Anderson Cooper

Don can't take this. If Biden does one of these a week, the Cheeto pimple will pop.
If you think Biden is in a mental decline then it’s obvious that Trump is in full blown dementia at this point.

JoeBiden: Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.   That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration.
Harris just said it’s a honor to be with Biden. Just during the primary she called him a racist.  🤡🤡
It’s so refreshing to hear some one that’s actually Presidential. In the 5 minutes I listed Biden has restored my hope that we will survive this pandemic and racial turmoil as a country.
Shame on . for not showing the Biden/Harris event live. All the other major stations are. Minor league guys. Minor league.
That was as good a Biden we’ve seen so far.
Joe Biden sounds like a President.

what do you believe will get worse? like even the covid response, I would have so much more faith in a biden administration dealing with it than a trump administration. trumps literally tryna force kids to go to school rn like thats fucked
LIVE: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris make 2020 debut
Okay I’m here for this Biden/Harris presser but the music is wearing me out
Uh huh. Every single republican I’ve met has said they don’t like his rhetoric but hate the dems and will vote him anyway. They’ve been conditioned that dems (even Biden) are trying to turn the country into the Soviet Union. I’m not sure why there’s a modern red scare??
that's interesting. trump defunding Obamacare has resulted in over 20 million people losing healthcare and 5 more million since corona. trump doesn't even have a health care plan while biden is proposing a public option so everybody would get insurance. thats not better?
Wait, so Democrat politicians and MSM can attend school but students can't? Biden Harris first appearance taking place at Dupont high school.
biden at least has a plan to decriminalize drugs which would make mass incarceration a much smaller issue. trump pardoned a couple black people and now he thinks he's done more for black people than any other person ever 😂
Exacly! Joe Biden/Harris is strong ticket. They actually gave the experience to run the country .
Given all the vitriol I see aimed at the Biden-Harris ticket, all I can say is, America is fucking doomed.
No Vote for Biden .

WATCH LIVE: Biden And Harris Give First Joint Remarks As Running Mates
Initial response to Harris' selection from the right has been to drag out all of her more extreme policy takes over the years. That's fair game, but I suspect they overestimate how effective they will be when she starts cleaning them up and sounding more in tune with Biden.
One of Harris' biggest problems in the primary was she didn't know what policies to support (see MFA debacle). She's not an ideologue, she wants to position herself to the electorate. Being a VP candidate will suit her. Aligning to Biden will make her stronger as a candidate.
Your point is what, that Biden picked the right person? I agree! #BidenHarris2020
But if that man wins again, there won't be anything. This country is at a tipping point. The disenfranchised have already been feeling it. I had no intention of voting for Biden, that Tangerine Farquuad showed me I have no choice when he gassed protestors for a photo op.
I honestly think so, Biden was leading in every poll without her, she'll only boast the lead for JOE and it shows that we're moving in the right direction, the ticket seems like change . I wasn't going to vote for Biden but I will now .
I will never fully support the Biden/Harris ticket, but my vote is going toward them. The stakes are too high.
I'm voting for the Biden/Harris ticket as well .
Oh I'm voting trump. Im not voting for the mentally incompetent joe Biden.
Well if Biden and Harris win then a Bernie like person and or policies will be at the top in 3-4yrs
Let the games begin! Biden/Harris 2020!
Goes straight to Joe

In your dreams, but Biden and Harris are looking back at you in your nightmares.   Better wear those depends so you don't pee on yourself in bed
If that is who you want for President  because we all know Joe Biden can't do it then know people who can laugh about jailing parents like this mom they can do anything. She isn't better than Trump. She will be harder to fight with all those libs sleeping like the fools they are
Translation:  I think I can take attention off Biden/Harris because I'm a little baby
But you never gonna find a perfect candidate.  I wasn't for Biden or Harris. But I sure as hell am not voting for the incumbent. And not voting basically is a vote for him.   Let me know when you agree with any politician on every policy and every decision.
Biden don't know and Harris Blows!
If this presidential election proves anything It’s that everyone needs to stop voting democratic and republican bc both parties are shit and fuck all that this is better than 4 more years of trump, like great 4 years of Biden and Kamala.🥴🥴🥴
Here's the thing: If the Harris pick pushes you to vote for Trump, you were always going to vote for Trump. That the Dem VP nominee would be someone with views like Harris is not new information. I don't see how a Biden-Harris ticket is somehow worse than a Clinton-Kaine ticket.
Biden deserves the free air time.  Trump is using taxpayer money in “briefings” to attack Biden anyway, why not take the stage and just say what your plans are, and ignore the drunk at the end of the bar.
Kamala Harris be like   "Vote for biden you niggers"
Why would Biden pick a progressive?
Uh huh you skipped all the people that Biden and Harris have put in prison with their policies, which is a hell of a lot more than 160,000.
They couldn't have Grimmace Bitch and Moan on how the Georgia election was stolen from her while Biden and Harris are trying to steal this election.  Hypocrisy only goes so far.
we could always overthrow the government like we been saying 🙄 but y’all too cap for that convo... so vote Biden you pussy niggas.
When the rest of the world realizes we're just printing money and stops using us as the base currency, the resulting fall will make the Great Depression look like a day at Disney. Trump doesn't care about this. Biden won't care about it. But you should.
I don’t get all into politics like that and no candidate will ever have every thing on your checklist but y’all really keep talking negatively about Biden and his mate, which will give Trump the votes. Y’all know y’all don’t want that man in office another 4 years.
The "I think we should shoot protestors" far right thinks crime bill Biden and copmala are far left as we march off the right side of the cliff.
I’m hoping Biden will nominate you to be his US Secretary of SHADE because 👑 #BidenHarris2020
Wow... When did Tucker join the Biden-Harris campaign? I don't think he's going to convince very many of his listeners, though. 🤣
Yes, because we're moving further towards a progressive candidate. The next vice president or president will be a progressive Sanders type but if Trump gets 4 more years his son will run lol and we'll move further right .so..The Sanders supporters like myself will vote for Biden
No,Biden and Harris will make America Better!!!
So Joe Biden’s entire policy is just a UNO reverse card. I’m good with that.
When the alternative is strengthening Trump's power, the choice is obvious. The bar is set very low, and Biden has sailed over it. The Democrats are our only hope to beat Trump. I can't handle 4 more years.
I would fire your campaign manager if he thinks it’s smart for  to run on Joe Biden being a racist 😂😂 Go back to killing black people and calling them names under your “Law &amp; Order” This nurse and #suburbanhousewife is voting Biden/Harris!!
Biden unfortunately
Suburban housewives will be voting for Biden/Harris!  You are dilusionsl!
“Fox News’ Chris Wallace: Trump Wishes Biden Had Picked Anyone But Kamala Harris” FOX News

Oh no!!! Say it isn’t so!
None are credible or they’d be in court. No matter how many times you repeat “racist”, it doesn’t come true. On the other hand, Kamala herself believes the allegations against Biden and called HIM racist 🤡
Idgaf Kamala Harris and Biden can disappear. Id be damned if I vote for some mf just cause you foundationless niggas tell me so😂 y’all be voting out of fear— that’s some sorry ass shit.
Agreed but I also think that’s why Biden got the Dem money.
Suburban. ✅ Wife. ✅ Lives in house. ✅ VOTING FOR BIDEN. ✅✅✅
You continue to spew centrist talking points ignoring all context.  Bernie's wealth is a very recent thing and it hasn't shaped his policy. If anything he was further left leaning following his first presidential run.  Biden crafts Jim Crow policy.
He also donated to Joe Biden
So you saying Obama/Biden didn't cause thousands of deaths? Or do only American lives matter?
According to the right, Joe Biden wants to defund the police which is exactly why he picked Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor and "top cop," for his VP pick.   Joe Biden is playing 15-dimensional chess to dismantle the police from the inside. The man is a mastermind
A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump because regardless nothing will change
Biden &amp; Kamala - one sucks, and the other blows.
I hate the guilt trip game. It’s a false ass statement by people who are uncertain their candidate will win.  Not voting is not voting.   Voting 3rd party is voting 3rd party.   Voting for Biden is voting for Biden   Voting for Trump is voting for Trump.  End of discussion.
Forces in the country, and within the Democratic Party, were indeed pushing Biden toward a history-making pick.
For some people, getting back to "normal" is the priority. They are 100% fine with Biden/Harris enacting Trump/Pence policies, but dressed up in 2020 DNC rhetoric. The quiet parts will be quiet again. The text will return to subtext. All will be well.
Historic Photo: Biden asks Harris to be his VP
As someone that lived through it, Biden was right to oppose forced busing. MAGA
Y’all save your anti-Biden shit for AFTER the election. Otherwise? You’re doing Tr*mp a favor. This includes retweets too luv
Think of how depressing it is to be a biden campaign staffer having to call some bullshit like family first, usa united super PAC and ask for 300k that goes to  for like a tweet a week and two rally appearances
Plus... I don't remember Biden announcing that he would be hiring someone based on their race and sex. I DO remember him saying that African American women were among the people he was considering.
This white woman ain’t voting for him! Biden/Harris has been the ticket I’ve wanted since she opted out. She’s the bulldog he needed and I cannot WAIT to see her tear Pence a new one in the Veep debate.

Everyone is talking about how Biden needs to win for the Supreme Court but he’s probably going to end up nominating a conservative justice to promote unity and then you guys will keep moving the goal posts to gaslight progressives 🥴
I really got beef wit everybody that voted for Biden in the primaries y’all and y’all candidate can eat a dick
I used the word 'season'. I think most would use 'era'. I think season is the correct word, as my suspicion is that to end the era, stop it from becoming a major turning point, the oligarchy intentionally choose Harris and Biden.
It amazes me how often Republicans can over look the lunacy that trump says and does. I can over look the stumbling speeches. The cognitive decline. The physical decline. But joe biden cant form a thought. You keep telling yourself that lie
can't wait for Biden to further explain the tremendous diversity in that community.
Yeah, lol, I know what you meant.  Can't change the past, wish I could.  All I can say is, Biden has pledged to reverse all of those policies begin reuniting families, and end detention in the first 100 days. It's on his website.  I mean, that's what we all want, right?
The entire thing is just very hypocritical and tone deaf, and with Biden’s track record with unintentionally insulting the Black community, it makes me wonder if this was a blatantly calculated tactic to have her as VP.
This is what he REALLY wanted to type: White Women will be voting for me. They want safety and lord knows they don’t want Black people or People of Color in their community. A vote for Biden means BLACKS!!! Be afraid be very afraid!
And that’s great but his campaign desperately needs enthusiasm. For those that really think electing Biden will make a significant difference in this country I can’t figure out 4 the life of me why they arent donating endless time and money like the unprecedented Bernie campaign.
Biden said he would serve only one term. I interpret his choice as setting her up for the big job. Always possible I am being wildly optimistic, but I am picking that hill to die on.
Just a reminder, final Hillary/Trump odds were ~68/32.  Roughly speaking, if this "game" was played three times, Biden wins twice and Trump once -- just like four years ago.  But now Trump is in a lot more control of how "lucky" he can get on Election night.
Nope. They'll be voting for Biden &amp; Harris. You've already defunded Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; want to gut them. They're general welfare items under the Constitution (Art I §8 Cl1).
I am 1000% sure Joe Biden has said, “and trust me, I have A LOT of half black friends” at least twice in the last 5 years
Adorable puppies.  Biden/Harris2020!!!
y’all think biden can beat trump? lol ok
So they differ in their devotion to the corporate hegemony, if only slightly. Biden befriended segregationists &amp; wrote policy that cruelly punished people for living in poverty. Predictably, it was used to target victims of institutional racism. Modern day Jim Crow.
I hope you’re not just shaming. That’s the incredibly lazy and child like way to go about things. The adult thing to do is what the Bernie crowd did for their candidate. If you want Biden/Harris to win you better be making phone calls, knocking on doors, and donating money.

You will make any excuse.  He just told you that Kamala believes Biden finger-raped one of his workers, and you’re ok with it. Astounding.
People arguing against this are in the same category as anti-maskers, imo. Self-centered outlook, justified by  a sense of moral/intellectual superiority.  Vote for Biden as if some border kid locked in a cage's life depends on it, because those are the stakes right now.
I know I said I'd support Biden regardless of his VP pick simply because he isn't Trump.....but y'all are testing me. A cop. He picked a cop. A cop with a questionable history of fairly applying the law to black people. READ THE ROOM JOE
Okay I guess we can wait a week and then discuss all the black people she helped lock and use as slave labor for California. Which was made possible thanks to Biden's policies. Party on.
voters?! Oh well, maybe now I’ll at least see a bumper sticker or two on the roads. Because you know, Biden ‘won’ the primary. 2/
Lots of people seem enthusiastic about the Biden/Harris ticket. That’s a start I guess. I wonder how many phone calls they’re willing to make and how much money those supporters plan on donating. Or are they only going to participate in democracy via the lazy way by shaming 1/
Facebook people talking bout they rather have 4 more years of trump, than Biden/Harris. And before you ask, no they aren’t
🔸Any quibble I have on any aspect of Kamala Harris is completely overshadowed by the threat that another Trump term represents, especially to our most vulnerable citizens.  🔸There are zero reasons to not vote for Biden as an alternative to Trump.
🔸White women conservative voters who are generally disgusted by Trump have also watched a lot of Fox News propaganda about "riots" in Portland, etc. and it is not unsavvy of Biden to pick a VP candidate that might allay these voters fears.
Well I just wouldn’t vote then. Bc Biden shouldn’t be our president lol
I know everyone hates Trump, for very good reasons, but y’all should really do your research on Biden/Harris before voting. Don’t shoot the messenger.. just trying to put people up on game. OUTSIDE of social media hype &amp; the news..
Gag! “Suburban housewife” here- you do not speak for me! I will vote for Biden/Harris to represent my voice
People from the right shit talking Kamala as a VP pick we’re already not voting for Biden. She wasn’t picked for you, so don’t act like your personal opinion is an indication of the 2020 outcome.
Your stance can only work for Biden-Harris because they are running against an open fascist. In your case, the ONLY way you can contest a sitting Senator is via POLICY. WHERE. DO. YOU. STAND??
That “half assed attempt” was mocked and labeled unecessary by Pelosi and countless other Dems and even xenophobic by Biden. Now it wasn’t enough? And bringing up New York’s handling of things is laughable. The governor should be criminally charged for his nursing home policy!
Leftists ARE the alienated voters. All of Biden's pablum is catnip to the rest of the voters who just want the same-old-same-old stuff and are hostile to any and all progressive policy proposals.

Fuck Joe Biden and Donald Trump as well. Yall can lie to yall selves and act like they not one in the same but choosing between the lesser of two evils is still choosing EVIL. Fuck that
If Biden wins, #Kamala will become President. She'd then be the first US president to have BOTH non-citizen parents at the time of her birth in the US (Obama had 1), a citizenship status that Scalia in Hamdi called "presumed."
I don't want to spend much time dunking on Biden or Harris before they replace #FascistTrump (that treatment mostly waits for these CorpoDems to be installed), But I wonder how long until the identity euphoria ends and voters start thinking about actual Biden-Harris policies.
Trump has serious and decades old connections with oligarchs in Russia laundering money. He is a compromised individual because he has laundered money for the Russians plus more. Biden is not compromised. Putin owns Trump. That’s the difference. Trump is a compromised asset.
I like Joe Biden’s plan where he is not going to allow any rich people in your middle class neighborhood.
I’m Catholic and I’m all Biden. So you go ahead and be a two face and vote for the orange evil. You pretty much make me sick.
a Biden/Harris administsrtarion allows for agency, organization, and bargaining power. The executive branch is only one piece of the puzzle. Vote progressives into congress and state gov.
Bernie had the momentum to flip seats. Bernie's policy generates excitement. Biden's campaign is begging and shaming people to show up simply because he isn't Trump. That's how we lose midterms.  Bernie wasn't corrupt enough for the corporate masters of the Democratic party.
This dude is gonna sweep. 🤦🏽‍♂️ DNC, once again, give us no good alternative. First Killary, now dementia Biden and flip flopped Harris.
She’s more racist than Biden then according to the left now !!!

Joe Biden went from praising Confederate organizations who supported the KKK to becoming the Dem pres candidate.   Come to think of it that's not a stretch.   Hillary got the Margaret Sanger award. She started planned parenthood to get rid of black people.
Joe Biden was the author of a 1994 crime bill that turned into a key reason for the 90's incarceration bump. He has shown a complete lack of touch in public relations, intentionally and accidentally insulting workers and anyone who questions him.
The Democratic Party's selection of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as proposed leaders of the U.S. shows a direct lack of touch/care in relation to multiple months of protests - main topics being police brutality and systemic racism.

Haha CNN tell you that? After 2 years of hearing non-stop media coverage about Russian collusion with ZERO proof you would think people would realize they got played. I guess not though. How about Biden’s actual connections to Ukraine and China though?
I just had a girl block me on Facebook bc I said that Biden was the lesser of two evils. She said that Biden is a child molester and I can’t understand bc I don’t have children. I literally can’t. Do people not realize that painting people out to prey on children is propaganda?
But my greatest area of common ground was the left's renewed emphasis on reforming the criminal justice system. I would've had more confidence in Biden's commitment to this had he picked just about anyone else.
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend there was a chance of me voting blue in November. But I definitely looked at a Biden ticket as I did Trump in 2016 and now: someone I'm not voting for but can at least expect to accomplish things in areas of common ground.
Who knows, maybe she does believe those things, but if she truly believed Biden had segregationist views would she agree to be his VP? Prob not, but she had no problem insinuating it anyways.   Okay so she's smeared a couple people as racists, thats it thought right?
Some of the "Vote Biden/Harris and hold them accountable in the WH" folks are the same ones that snidely scold anyone who supports leftist challengers to Republicans or  corporatist Democrats.   Their vision of accountability is feckless.

You do realize Biden never said he would pick a black woman for VP. He said he would pick a woman for VP and would pick a POC for supreme court and would CONSIDER  a woman of color for VP. I still say he will pick Hillary because he never said he would pick a woman of color.
