Biden Mocks Trump Citing Arizona As Model. Arizona Gov Rips Biden: ‘Come On Man! Get Out Of Your Basement’
How do we handle this? If he is coming out and saying he's only doing it to "steal" votes away from Biden how does America not come out fully equipped to punish him? This can't be legal.
He's been a top surrogate for the campaign since the beginning of the primary. If Biden wanted to stop him from sticking his foot in his mouth to the press, he could.
We are not done!  We need to be proactive by talking to friends and family about why voting for Biden is so important and actually CASTING OUR VOTE is crucial for the future of our country. Volunteer for local campaigns, phone banks, and you will make a difference! We can win!
Americans know who you are at your core, and we’re going to elect Joe Biden to remove your racist stench from the Oval Office ... #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Maybe Biden shouldn’t have spent the last forty years setting the stage for him, then? 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
I’d rather have questions about policy and how Joe Biden’s healthcare proposals are going to cover Americans during a time of mass pandemic and unemployment.   But trivia questions about the candidates relationship with their imaginary friend is important too I guess. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Apparently Biden's dog is named Major, and it is perhaps a prosecutable offense if they are not releasing regular updates regarding this good dog, preferably in his voice, titled "Major News"
I have many political issues with Biden, but I’ve always admired him as a person for how he coped with his stutter. I don’t talk about mine much (because it’s my business and no one else’s), but he hits the nail on the head here.
I think it’s sexist for Biden to limit his VP picks to only women anyway. It harkens back to Romney’s #BindersFullOfWomen. And it implies that a woman couldn’t be VP if competing against men.  It’s fucked up that this is the not-so-subtle message that Biden is broadcasting.
You could tell that Biden's climate policies were a joke well before they were ever published, but when he leaned into regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry, and said fracking jobs weren't on the table it became dumb to even pretend like he'd be good on climate.
You do realize the worst thing you ever say about Joe Biden is that you call him sleepy, right? Take a look at the plethora of awful and accurate things people call you.
Now the R's are trying to siphon the support for Biden by attempting to get Kabye West on the ballot. When D's flip the Senate, impeach Donny again and convict him and throw him out of the White House. Donny can spend the rest of his PATHETIC life fighting lawsuits
Pssst...I’m not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the “culprit” (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn’t take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
Vote for Biden.
Ummm. If trump thinks a presidential election can ‘hurt God,’ he fundamentally misunderstands the concept of God. For him, religion is just something he pretends to believe in for political advantage. Believe or don’t believe, but don’t lie about it
In a socialist country people are easier to control and it ties in with covid19 Bill Gates anthony fauci child trafficking epstein Hollywood pedos nancy pelosi khamila harris joe biden most of the music industry and a few people in professional sports.

This white-ish person is voting for Biden.
Wouldn't it be something if the supporters of Kayne really were people abandoning tRump! And had no effect on Biden - tRump needs to loose by a landslide - he failed all of us~  #TrumpLoser #VoteBiden
Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
When are the Biden deepfakes coming? October?
People who make lists like this think bad Lefty is anyone who doesn’t put a Biden sign in their yard.
Yes. Just one of the reasons: the GOP work hard getting rid of polling stations in areas they predict Biden votes, just to make this scenario real. #WeWillVote #Biden2020
No, what am I listening to on OPB right now? A bit on Biden's comments on race!?! Ok OPB, give trump equal time 🤣 everytime tRump says anything stupid about race give him that much coverage - 10 mins a day?!?!! Journalist DO BETTER!
What percent of Americans think Biden will be alive come November 3rd?
I dont disagree with your statement on 45. I find him to be very revolting in nearly every aspect. I just hate how people then become blinded to how horrible Biden is as well . Idk where people got the idea i liked trump...
Biden and whoever in 2020 and then we’ll slap back in 2024.
“There is a lot of room in there for oil and gas,” - Matt Gallagher, pres. of Parsley Energy, West Texas oil producer, after getting a peak at Biden’s #energy plan.
Take time to break it down. Even if you're convinced that we have to replace Trump with Biden there is room for Green voters.
I simply don't agree with that characterization of Biden, he generally handles questions just fine.
Looks like it was all progressives asking Biden to pick Bass so I'm ruling her out
2/2  The only person to blame if Biden doesn't beat the #OrangeTroll in November will be Biden. It's his job to make people want to vote for him.  Online trolls bullying people won't change minds.
And Biden just started opposing the Hyde Amendment in June of last year as he was planning another presidential run, he doesn't give a shit about abortion.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
Biden is proposing a return to the Obama era tax rates, taxes that were already significantly lower than those we enjoyed under famed far leftie Ronald Reagan.
If Biden wins, I predict CNN will continue to talk about Trump for the next 4 years.
Sure we will. If we get the Greens to 5% we get matching funds. We pressure the Democratic Party to move left. Biden and Trump aren't the only options, and many votes in "safe" states will be wasted on them, when people could vote Green instead.
Yes, really, he's dealt in nepotism during his entire career in politics, and has taken cash for things like helping elect Republicans since he was VP.
Wow, it's almost like this is why the left really didn't want Biden.  Its almost like we wanted someone who wasn't a renown liar with skeletons in the closet.  Its almost like we remember 2016.  Its almost like BIDEN ISNT THE MOST ELECTABLE CANDIDATE.
'US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election' here:
Damn Whoopi Goldberg and Joe Biden ended Apartheid? That's crazy I had no idea
Russia could hack Biden's campaign and the medias response will be "Why are the dem campaigns so easy to go after? Whats wrong with them?" or "are they in too much disarray?"
since this tweet had like 450 likes and counting I'd like to take this opportunity to tell everyone that even though he's awful and I hate him, you should vote for Biden because no matter how bad he is, he would've handled the past several months better, and you fucking know it.
I personally can’t wait for the debates...all the people saying Joe Biden can’t get through a sentence obviously haven’t been following along. He has ALWAYS gaffed, but he’s not an incoherent moron like Trump. Biden will crush him as long as he keeps his cool.
Trump aides frustrated by his ‘nonsensical’ Biden attacks in Ohio: AP reporter
Same. I really wish more people in solid blue states would abstain from voting Biden. Hilary stans really clung to that 3 mil popular vote after she lost and I feel awful that I contributed to that number.
As a conservative, I must say that this is no longer something to smile about. You are facilitating husband abuse, Jill Biden! STOP IT.
The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
As much as i'm not enthusiastic with Biden, I at least can feel reassured that the american left in 2020 didn't make the mistake the German left did in 1932.
Imagine how the person's hair smells.  That's how Biden is going to choose.  Then again, a bucket of shit is smarter than Joe Biden.
West, in text interview, indicates he is in fact running to siphon votes from Joe Biden.
Bernie supporters don't think that about Tulsi. They just don't like her for endorsing Joe Biden. Especially since he stands for everything she's against!
If Biden was President, it would probably take a month.  Suck it up buttercup.
In caveman voice: Hurt god. hurt Bible. Biden bad.
Biden said he won’t even take a test, and then couldn’t complete a sentence at the end of making his statement on why he wouldn’t take the test 🤦🏾‍♂️
the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
Nina is just the best. Wish she was the VP. That’d go a ways towards Biden’s hemorrhaging of leftie support.
He's also, worse, imo, actively being negligent and just killing civilians. He's so unfit, he's criminally unfit. Biden may prove to be unfit, but he's also trying to be better, and already has succeeded. Donaldo just is selfish and weak willed. Worst American president!
Oh  I want to thank you so much. I've been a bit down today, since  is still occupying OUR Whitehouse, but seeing this gave me the best belly laugh I've had in months.   Thanks so much for the comedy relief.    2020
Every time he opens his mouth he says something racist, classist, or just plain stupid. He's taken positions to the right of Trump on numerous foreign policy issues.  He's barely coherent, and when he does make sense, what he says is offensive. Biden is #BlueMAGA nothing more.
Hah, and there are legions of people who think the virus response is going to be significantly different under Biden.
Every time I see someone post about “Biden/Rice” I have to take a moment to breathe and consciously reassure myself they’re talking about Susan Rice and not Condoleezza. Because Condoleezza would be a really believable choice at this point.
Who's really in the bunker?!  Biden... but they run that rhetoric about Trump locked in the basement of the White House...   oops!
Huh? Stray Y chromosome? Like Biden dropped his Y off? I don't get it, what was the question again??? Those are not my shoes....cabbage, never played it before...prunes? where did I get prunes? no, it was a VW bus, on fire, chasing a horse down one of those Seattle like hills...y
I'M BAFFLED! So we're going to wait till Jan, hoping Biden gets elected, before anybody does anything!?!? At least 150,000 ppl that didn't have to die die!?! This is a F'ing emergency! There has to be some kind of emergency action, al la Navy doctor overrides the ships captain?
No. But we can laugh at Biden for being racist though..
#2020Elections #Biden, No one likes anyone telling us what we think and what we are.
Let us not forget that Joe Biden was a single dad for 5 years too!
Last night I asked my dad if Trump could do ANYTHING that would disturb him enough to stop supporting the maniac &amp; his answer was, “no, not if that means a vote for Biden.”  Guys, that’s fucking horrifying. Fear tactics work. Trump supporters will stand by him “no matter what...”
FOCUS: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand in the Way of a Trump Prosecution I totally disagree with Uncle Joe ! A prosecution of a criminal President is exactly what democracy demands ! We’ve had 2 Treasonous presidents pardoned for their “ High Crimes “ already
What happens when Biden starts botching his speeches…reverse fake news
The Black turnout for Biden has to be one of the most searing indictments of white supremacy I can think of.  Blacks voted for Biden because they knew whites would be *most likely* to support the most racist candidate in the field. And it’s an astoundingly accurate calculation.
Kanye Admits His Presidential Bid Will Take Votes Away From Biden: ‘I'm Not Denying It’
US Intelligence officials: Russia denigrating Joe Biden ahead of election
No, even my pet spider, Barry, said he &amp; his spider clan were voting for Biden ... then he ate a mosquito.🕷️
On the right, we have a bucket of runny shit. On the left, a decent choice. But S.E. won't abandon her bucket of shit unless Biden is perfect. People like that are called Shy Republicans. They don't want to see the disgust their choice produces, so they pretend to be persuadable.
Could’ve had a candidate that was genuinely doing well with Latino voters  because he cared instead of relying on a Contra death squad supporting republican to sway them with an endorsement.
The difference is that Biden would never even contemplate taking help from China to win whereas we know how “Russia, if you’re listening” Trump would react.
I agree I would love to see a Biden-Warren ticket!
Oh wow. Thank you! I think that's my first ever  😊
of all things I am I am a Marine. I don't pull the uniform on anymore at 04, but it is still in me, and I see so many wrongs. how can a democrat sit and know Americans will be slaughtered like animals by animals? I can't grasp the concept and not apologizing for it either f Biden
I feel like i'm on PINS and NEEDLESS every time he speaks. Yes, it's unfair Trump can say whatever he wants and gets away with it but I cannot be holding my breath every time Biden gives an interview.
As a latino, I do not support this couple. They should be ashamed of themselves. They very well know Trump doesn’t support them yet they support him. Also their ad is trash. They just say Biden is going to be a bad leader, that’s it! Superficial attacks not worth your time.
Oh boy Putin, you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar didn't you? And we're going to everything we can to make Biden win, and then, you're gonna get slapped like the dwarf bitch you are. And I'll tell you what, your pet troll  is not going to enjoy this.
Please. Who knows when it was taken down and why. Also, why would she still have a 2020 store when Biden's been the nominee for months?  Furthermore, if she's agreed to a cabinet position it would be a different reason to shut it down.
Serious question: Trump is a racist who sexually assaults women. Biden is a racist who sexually assaults women.   How can Russia, China, or Iran possibly make them look any worse as candidates?
True that, Trump blocked Chinese Air travel early on, Getting bashed by the Left "Pelosi/Biden" which they ultimately retracted their comments and praised Trump for quick swift Action. -
Joe Biden needs to commit to this before I vote for him. Day one, close down detention centers Period.
Data ALSO hypothesis "Trump voters won't admit being Trump voters to a live pollster," which, if true, would lead to Biden underperforming live polls, and slightly underperforming or matching computer/robo polls  But we're skeptical of that since it's been wrong many times
Biden smears himself, we’re just keeping tabs. #BlueDevolution is making fascism real again.
If joe biden could actually hurt god, like cause physical pain and misery to god, I would vote for him twice. Once via mail and once in person.
Biden! Can! Be! Pushed! Left!
Is that why when I bring up his terrible record and weak policies, liberals call me a Russian asset? Putin didn't make Biden do all those bad things. They are just exploiting his weaknesses.
Maine for Biden, and Sara Gideon!
People will do anything to steer votes away from Biden. However, I reeeeally doubt anyone voting to Kanye would be voting for Biden in the first place.
Sigh... Men tell women what they should or shouldn't say is not a good look.   Also his race is relevant. He is a high profile black celebrity. His race and celebrity are being used to siphon black voters from Biden.
I'm like just now seeing the Joe Biden gaffe and it kind of feels like conservatives are trying their hardest to make a huge deal out of this. You can talk to me when BLM protests aren't being tear gassed anymore.
His job is to raise stock prices. If stock prices are going up, he wins. My guess is that the Trump mob is cooking the books on the economic numbers, because they know if there's a stock market crash, Biden wins and the GOP loses the Senate.
The only things denigrating Biden are his record and the garbage leaving his mouth.
joe biden is absolutely dead. we have not seen or heard anything from him directly the dnc is covering it up that man is seriously deceased
They're not just random individuals though, they are people that Biden has chosen to elevate. I agree with Armando, the headline is sensationalistic (and probably not written by Traister) but the content is spot-on.
are you saying sniffing little girls is joe biden's right &amp; not his privilege?
Something I’ve been thinking about re: online influence campaigns is that won’t they eventually cancel each other out in their influence? If China wants no Trump and Russian wants no Biden, their efforts will appear organic and have no more influence than if they hadn’t meddled.
Biden’s public appearances have sure quieted the voices of centrist democrats that have been dragging Sanders and his supporters since March.  Buyers remorse?
Biden doesn't support defunding police. Ask any Portland Protester.
who does biden pick for vp
I hope you aren’t voting for Biden then.
Trump paraded a lying little pissant in front of the country who mislead and caused a total US shutdown. And now he’s pushing hard for a fast track vaccine. That bothers me. Biden bothers me more so I’ll vote trump but doesn’t it trouble your soul a little?
Dude, you're the one saying "minorities wont' vote for Biden." I'm just going on the terminology you're using.
Every time Joe Biden comes out of the basement for an interview, why can't he just be chill and not say racially loaded things? He and his handlers have to know that Trump is losing this election all by himself and Biden should just keep his mouth shut but he can't help it.
Minorities overwhelmingly backed Biden, you lying tool.   I'm not telling you how to vote. You can throw away your vote all you want.  But I am telling you that attacking Biden pre-election only serves to help Trump. This doesn't bother you, of course. You want Trump reelected.
The Democrats have also been suppressing the vote. You’re not going to get progressive policy from Biden, and you’re not going to get voting rights from a party that tries to take candidates off the ballot unilaterally.
US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. -
You forgot Reagan, GW and HW Bush.   But I agreed, Clinton and Biden’s criminal justice choices were horrendous.
Biden wants to cut SS Biden would veto M4A if he got a bipartisan bill. Biden put in jail many non-violent  offenders and won’t legalize cannabis.  Those are Biden’s ambitions.
You're beating a dead horse:   Voting for Biden is a given. It's not an argument. You're trying to create a division where there is none.   We need to talk about what we want, focus on people who will represent us, like  and PUSH corporate DEM's to do the right thing.
lmao you're so fucking mad about being called out on your enabling fascists  again: do all the fucking criticism of biden you want starting the day after the election. Until then, you're just helping Trump
Stop trying to fuck over Biden
I'd be absolutely intrigued to meet a real human being who, a month ago, was done with Trump and was ready to vote for Biden, and then over the course of the past 30 days thought, "Wait, I changed my mind. I like what Trump has been doing lately, and I want 4 more years."
Every white or brown person I know is voting for Biden.
Undermining the only alternative to Trump *is* helping him.  Again: Shut up until November 4, and I'll believe you. But until then, undermining Biden is helping Trump win.
Theory: pollsters nervous about underestimating Trump and being blamed for being "wrong again". They consciously or unconsciously put finger on the scale for Trump.   Worse pollsters have a bigger effect  If true, we'd expect Biden to beat polls in Nov  Can't know until then
President Biden and Congress will be busy, working to repair the damage from this Republican regime.
The vetting is not even close. One has literally walked through the fire of a presidential campaign. The other has not. No one energizes the Democratic Party like Harris. Biden can win with anyone but if he wants to win the house and senate he should pick Harris.
The minorities/poor people who overwhelmingly voted for Biden in the primary, you mean?   How about you shut up until after the election then? And on Nov 4 resume all the criticism you want?  (You won't, since your objective is to make Biden lose / Trump win, of course)
Nope. Joe Biden will build a great admin and HRC would’ve been a really great President !!
Completely agree! I also have a child’s vision about how politics work and can’t discern between obvious differences in ideology! You and I are exactly the same! Just like Biden and trump!
Can't wait for all the righteous indignation to erupt when Biden announces his running mate.
idk fam it sounds like you and I agree more on the immorality of billionaires than Joe Biden and I ever will
lmao you'd think that biden supporters would want to FORGET his 1988 campaign
And compared to Biden and Trump, he is easily, clearly the most mentally cognitively capable. He is literally the only one of the three actually capable of doing the job of president!
Yep. It's clear Biden's fixers have reworded and walked back his original comments. Easy to see when you compare what he says unscripted versus what is printed afterwards. What a joke!
What comes out of Biden's mouth and what comes at a trump's mouth, Are not even comparable Anyone's allowed to make a mistake long as they corrected trump never does his mistakes are intentional
You can't even see what's in that photo. Was that picture taken with a potato?  But here is a clear picture of Biden and his KKK buddy.   Leave the memes to the right and we'll leave the lies and insults to the left. Deal?
I would swim in Covid-infested waters and crawl across broken glass to vote for Joe Biden on Nov. 3.   Oh. But I don’t have to.  I live in Oregon, where we have vote-by-mail for EVERYONE.
Pollak: Joe Biden Mocked Trump‘s Faith for Months, Shocked When Trump Fires Back  via
For them? We could actually reject their duopoly and #VoteGreen, otherwise they will be fine.  Trump or Biden the results are the same for the oligarchy.
I agree with u. Don’t mean I want trump, but Biden has a hidden agenda who knows wtf he on
Biden has a stutter. Otherwise no different from the rest of the political establishment.
I'm not worried about West taking votes from Joe Biden. If I were a Black person I'd be very insulted by all of the people worrying about West. Black people are far too intelligent to fall for West or trump (who is 💯% behind what West is doing I promise you). Calm down sister.
But - I would not trust him to actually leave And I don’t want Republicans against Trump to switch their votes from Biden to Pence.
Running interference for Biden. Shame.
Biden attends Mass &amp; takes communion, like many other American Catholics who violate Church doctrine on certain matters, such as contraception. The Right has cafeteria Catholics, too, who consider themselves devout, but, e.g., support the death penalty. Not our job to judge.
Biden could pick Angela Davis as his VP nominee and it wouldn’t be enough to mask his innate racism, which is deeply encoded into almost every strand of his political DNA.
Just a thought, if Trump's poll numbers are in the tank weeks before the election, does he replace Pence with Nikki Haley?  Especially if Biden picks a very dynamic woman for VP. #Biden2020 #2020election #trump
Yea I’ve been trying to make my husband legal for years. It’s so expensive and now he’s finally towards the end where he has to go back to his country and I don’t trust Trump that he could come back. Biden please fix it so he doesn’t have to leave us.
Because he’s deliberately trying to take votes away from Joe Biden
As an avid anti establishment and Biden Critic, I strongly recommend reviewing the records of Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Biden isn’t at all perfect, nor am I a fan, but both records prove that Trump is focused on leadership from the past. Biden is not. #Biden2020 #NotmeUs
the point is that he is the current elected president of the United States. Never said I liked Biden either.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment  #FoxNews
(I should add that I shorted it with you again today and I'm not criticizing or trolling, just observing and attempting to understand the market's movements here. I can see it correcting next week if it doesn't today, particularly if Old Wall doesn't like the Biden VP pick.)
It should be possible for Biden to appoint staff to follow up on the crimes and corruption of the Trump administration without appearing to be partisan.
WaPo Fact-Checker Who Said Joe Biden Didn't Say What He Said Gets Debunked Hours Later - by Biden
The point is NOT that Trump is better than Obama. The point is that even so-called progressive Democrats have been pursuing harsh anti-immigrant policies long before Trump. Unless we recognize this fact, we are doomed to repeat the same measures under President Joe Biden.
I am so worried the next 4 years everyone will be saying "But Biden's gaffes" because the amplification

I don't think Biden is capable of that level of thought at this point. His dementia has erased any restraint and  unleashed his real thinking as a bigot. His bigotry is undeniable from his past comments.

JOE BIDEN SAYS THE QUIET PART OUT LOUD AND WE GET CRICKETS FROM SOROS. WHEN I DO IT, I CATCH THE ASS BEATING OF A LIFETIME. GETTING A LITTLE TIRED OF THIS BOOMER SHIT
Probably campaigning for Biden...
Are you fucking kidding me? Biden could pick a wet rock for all I care. Trump is 100% dangerous so VP pick is meaningless. Why would you ever give Trump any chance by writing in? This is no game anymore.
We can see with our own eyes that Biden isn't well; we should have compassion for him.  My compassion may have to wait until AFTER he stops acting a fool and being a tool to help Trump get re-elected.  Remember Hillary Clinton and the damage she did.  Have compassion for America!
So tRUmp who is an unapologetic bigot and white supremacist thinks Biden doesn't deserve votes from blacks? Seriously, #TrumpIsNotWell
You can’t even pretend Biden is worth my vote.
Wouldn't put it past them to run obvious hacking propaganda campaigns to make it look like China is meddling in our elections on Trump's behalf to create another 'asset' narrative as a means to embolden more votes against him, since they know Biden is far more pro-China.
Governor Whitmer has an approval rating of 57%.  Biden is leading Trump by 11 points .  We can do this #Michigan! #DemCastMI
I will vote for Biden no matter who he picks as anyone is better than 45 and group.
Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.        TRUMP LACKS CHARACTER.  HE’S NOTHING BUT A LYING, AMORAL LOSER.
I don't know a single Republican voting for Biden. I occasionally heard such but never heard an actual person say that. Seems like only Democrat shills would say that to make us think Biden is winning. Trump will win in landslide. No question.
It almost doesn't matter- best to ignore this spoiler for Biden.  Target demographic for KW is the "disenfranchised extreme left"as a protest vote- but he doesn't have any real plans or policy, just noise and distractions.
Oh yeah, I remember how Biden pushed for the death penalty for the Central Park Five by taking out a full page in a major publication, all who were wrongly accused and jailed. And the litigation for viloatng the Fair Housing Act.  Oh wait, that was Trump, the pillar of diversity
Saying That Joe Biden Is Against God Is Not Only Not True But Is Blasphemous!!!! Donald Trump Holding The Bible Upside Down For A Photo Op Is Sacrilegious?? I Would Bet $1,000.00 That Trump Has Never Read A Single Passage Of Scripture In His Life??? So The Religious Right What??!
The press eats up gaffe's for an economic living. For me,of course, tRump's gaffe's   equal daily lies that kill US :( #biLL  via
Watching Dems bickering about Biden’s VP pick is like listening to siblings quarrel and I’m about to put some of you in a time out.
I see what you did there, trying to prop up Kanye thinking it will take Black votes from Biden.   Everyone knows Kanye has literally 0% chance of winning and would only be a worthless protest vote.
I like Felix’s assessment of the 2020 election choices in latest Chapo episode: we are at the end of American imperial hegemony. Bernie was a negotiated withdrawal, Donald Trump is belligerent denial of reality, and and Joe Biden is beaten acceptance with nostalgia for good times
Yup, when Trump went to church, gassed protesters, and forced our top Military General into a terrible photo shoot to help satisfy his ego, that was it! Forced me to consider Biden!
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’   STUNNING BIT OF PROJECTION FROM “BUNKER BOY” TRUMP, SQUATTING INSIDE HIS BUBBLE AND REFUSING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM KNOWLEDGEABLE REPORTERS
Putin had nothing to do with trump getting elected its actually been proven. And obama and hillary clinton are under indictments for spying on a presidential campaign. U been in the basement hidin with joe biden?
😂😂😂😂 I'm generally anti mixing religion and politics, but I'd love to watch Biden kick tRump's a** on this front on live TV. There is no prep tRump could do that would come close to a life of church going. 😂😂😂😂
Joe Biden sucks, and is awful. (still voting for him)
Vote for Joe Biden
I’m no Biden cape by any stretch (cuz he’s ALWAYS saying stupid/racist shit), but that Latino/Black clip is being taken completely out of context.
Yeah I think voting for Biden is bad strategy, but I'm not about to tell someone who is doing it because they're scared of the fash that it's a bad idea.  I get it, it's a legitimate reason.
Right of course unless your joe biden he would jump all over that shit🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oregon isn't turning red... But there is no excitment for Biden like there was for Hillary here...
And here I thought we were talking about Biden.
Geezus - Miller is a JEW.  I can’t believe you’re voting for Biden if you stand against racism 😡
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY. I’m Mexican so my family is full of old Catholics. They alll believe these charges. (!!) Joe Biden’s team SHOULD fact-check all this! Should have a priest explain that the Catholic faith requires us to honor our God and religion OURSELVES, not bc of a law.
People need to be put to sleep then.
So who is running against Trump on the democratic side? Biden thinks he has a chance? Unreal.
Damn, this comment's gotta be the most racist thing I've seen since the last time Joe Biden spoke.
Ouch.
I came across an account today that follows &amp; reposts both rose &amp; MAGA feeds, uses sexist &amp; racist language, &amp; claims Biden is not “progressive” enough. I went to block the presumed Bot &amp; found he has over 3,000 followers. If that ain’t proof our educational system needs help...
If Trump would shut up for a few hours, Biden gaffs would get more traction. Biden has always been gaff-prone. It seems Biden can say anything because all anyone wants to hear is the latest bs from Trump.
Biden is such a sleepy weakling he can hurt god...
Joe Biden and Clarify, in the same sentence?  That’s an oxymoron!
Bernie would have at least been able to say I tried and the house democrats and senators stopped me, so we need to replace some of them, Biden will be working in lockstep with house dems and the senate to do nothing.
People hate Trump, and in combination with the pandemic that's likely enough for this election, but structural problems in American lives aren't going away and once Trump is no longer around to blame, that blame is going to fall on Biden and other Democrats if they don't deliver.
This is an incredibly articulate statement. I’m not a big Biden fan at all. I’d prefer Kamala as the nominee for President ( or the dream of  ) but I will crawl over glass to vote for Biden. Trump is that dangerous and even more for minorities.
We'll see, Democrats got their asses kicked in 2010 after running on big meaningful change and then delivering a GOP healthcare plan.  Biden isn't even pretending that he's anything other than Obama's third term.
Joe Biden was baptized Catholic, but his actions and voting record say otherwise.
Surely both of these smart capable women will be in a Biden administration one way or another... If I were choosing it would be Harris/VP and Rice /SOS or NSA...
Joe Biden is the perfect personification of what ails the Catholic Church today.
Is that why Biden is more popular with college educated voters? Also are you somehow being classis and racist by assuming Blacks and Hispanics aren't college educated?  Do you have a diagnosis? I mean that with actual concern.
Now he’s just stringing together random trigger words. Joe Biden is against God? And can hurt Him? Wow. And no religion, too.
Trump said Biden ‘hurt God.’ Biden has spent his life drawing from his Catholic faith.
Biden keeps speaking for the Black community (with foot in mouth) and gropes children. #YouAintBlack #HidinBiden #BLM
Biden Tells Staffers To Pick Any Black Person For VP 'Since They All Think The Same Anyway'  via
Honestly, watching Biden repeatedly put his foot in his mouth &amp; coast through his campaign, I think there’s a high possibility Trump will be re-elected. He’s awful and dangerous but Biden offers us so little. I’m voting Biden but I’ll never forgive the DNC for foisting him on us.
"Ana" not "Anna"  "Team Biden" not "Team Obama"  Do better.
This is pretty clearly not referring to every Biden voter as blue maga. It’s specifically about Biden voters who are claiming Clinton lost because of Stein or some such nonsense.
Also, a man who is using a mentally unstable man (Kanye) to try to manipulate the Black community into voting for him.  It’s not going to work.  Trump is a racist.  Joe Biden is a good and decent man.
- It’s Ana - It’s Team Biden
Is he trying to lose his base to Biden?
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
Biden is the dead cactus. That’s exactly why the VP pick matters. I believe Joe to be “moderate” enough to actually pick a Republican Woman as his VP thus handing the presidency to team R when he resigns due to senility. The VP pick is everything and will be bought &amp; paid for.
Okay Paulie, cite evidence that Biden doesn’t attend church, isn’t Catholic, and isn’t more religious than Trump.
While you wrote this I just donated another $25 to Biden's campaign.

Biden sniffs kids. Clinton is definitely a pedo. I’m no liberal FYI. Trumps side does the same. You know how many times Clinton and Trump have golfed and “played” together through the years? People forget that too. Both sides apparently. I can’t stand the defenders on both,
Rock and Roll Jew Show is back with a campaign playlist for Joe Biden.
I hate the double standard. Herr Trump is a racist/sexist gaff machine, yet every time Biden misspeaks it’s time to make hay. Preposterous.
Biden seems to like the walls in his basement....
Pretty sure he’s a Democrat who’s worried by Biden’s slurred, wandering, aggressive speech.  The debates are going to be a national embarrassment.
People way overvalue how important any campaign message was in many elections. Obama didn't win because "Hope and Change" was an uniquely perfect message. He won because Bush got us in two unsinkable wars and crashed the economy. Biden is winning because Trump killed grandma
Hannity: Biden doesn't know what city he's in  via  Hollow Joe is sad &amp; Dimms should be embarrassed to let him continue, but Trump hate drives the Left.
You don’t have any obligation to defend the dumpster fire that is the Biden campaign.
Joe Biden is not a racist. He merely holds tightly to racist viewpoints, and constantly makes racist comments, and has a history of pushing legislation that disproportionately attacks people of color.
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
I would wait days in line to vote for Bernie. I likely won’t even vote by mail for Biden. My state is safe, and I refuse to reward the  for cheating us yet again of a leader we NEED so they can retain their power and cushy lifestyles.
Liar- Biden doesn’t stand for the radical left-wing. It’s just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
I absolutely agree that Biden is appealing to centrists.  He provides all of the austerity and crushing of the poor that Trump provided, but without any of the embarrassing headlines.
Joe Biden jjust used the N word live on camera. WTF is wrong with him??
Joe Biden offended all blackface Americans with his divisive comments. Shame sham shame on you, Joe.
Thank you Joe Biden for that 1994 crime bill
S.E. Cupp shouldn't try to make voting for Biden some big personal sacrifice. We get that she doesn't agree with everything Biden supports. Neither do I but I'm not voting for Trump or writing in Bebe Neuwirth on my ballot.
You say, with an anti-semitic slur.  (Which is odd, considering that Biden is Catholic. But, you're not known for accuracy).
Luckily Obama isn’t the signal flagger on who is and isn’t racist.  Biden is systemically racist and somewhere in between unapologetic and carelessly mistaken regarding every racist idea he perpetuates.  For example, unapologetic re: “crime” bills / mistaken re: black + latinx
For all the God loving Christians in the back who fear Joe Biden.
You post about Biden saying racist crap and you constantly say "China Virus". This really hurts the Asian Americans and is not safe seeing how your followers believe anything you say. Just call it by it's name, stop spreading hate and do your job.
I can't even fathom why we picked Biden in the first place, so I'm not going to pretend to understand what voters are basing their decisions on.
Biden is backed by Republicans. You’re most certainly playing their game. Their electoral strategy is to capture both parties, and you’re not even willing to oppose them.
No Joe Biden isn't racist only 50% of what he says is racist the other 50% doesn't make any sense if he was on his game like you claimed he is he should have no problem debating Trump and Pitkin Trump apart so if he's still on his game as you claim you should be pushing him
Biden is pro-choice.

Joe Biden did not write this.
It's because Trump thinks he is God. And yes, Biden is going to lock his ass.
People are all "Biden doesn't write his own public statements", and I'm like "has any major presidential candidate in the past couple decades?"
I think Andrea Mitchell didn't reread her tweet before posting. But Obama is helping advise Biden. btw, Obama has no desire for another term. He's happy where he is.
I fucking knew the moment Biden started to actually start giving interviews again that Trump was going the body the shit outta him. I hate trump but his spin machine and shitposting is...uncomfortably good

On the other hand, having Team Trump trying to paint Biden as a racist might hurt Trump with his own racist base, who might see an alternative.
Age got nothing to do with it, friend. Biden is a Republican. He's better than Trump, but he's still a Republican.
Do not say Biden doesn’t like God or hurt God that’s not the way to do it use his own church won’t let him take communion because of his pro choice stance works much better don

The real reason people object to Biden's nomination: HIS racism

Just like Biden but the left tends to have *slightly* better mental cognition.  C'mon,  C'mon man, you know, the thing, c'mon!
Im black and me and all of my friends and my whole family are voting for Joe Biden.
You do you, but let us know if you change your mind. Can’t buy it myself. IMHO Biden is just as big a threat as Trump, but will make folks complicit and complacent. I think that’s potentially even more dangerous. We’re on a slippery slope and Biden just adds to our speed.
I didn’t know that Joe Biden had the power to challenge a god.
If Biden elects to run with a corgi, you should still vote for him. Not doing so is actively voting for corruption, bankruptcy (moral and actual) and a 1000 dead Americans a day. Just vote for a human in November.
I think we need to start ranking your lies.  This would rank with the top 10.  Keep trying to find a way to discredit Biden.  Maybe you could try for 30,000 missing emails.  That worked last time.

Well, at least them what plans social  media strategy and write the tweets aren't senile old racists, anyway.  So definitely vote Biden, the POTUS tweets will never, ever be written by him. Not like that fucker Trump. That is a promise, America.
I think it's a longer shot than 2016, at least as of right now. But debates will change a lot. People who don't watch things like the recent Yahoo News video watch debates, and there's no way Biden pulls off hours of sounding sane.

Joe Biden is the best the Democrats could come up with to take on Donald Trump. That's just depressing.

What do you think Joe Biden actually said
Responding to your last tweet, Biden is incorporating lots of progressive policies into his platform and directly working with progressive leaders like AOC. So maybe I’m naive, but I’m hopeful.
If this interview was a “car crash” for Biden, the Trump-Axios interview was an “exploding star” of ridiculous spectacle. The media is going to try to latch onto any Biden gaffe they can, but there’s no real comparison by virtue that Biden is compassionate and willing to listen.
Joe Biden needs Malcolm Tucker.

Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Plagiarism in Joe Biden's 1988 presidential campaign. Now he can't remember. The Trump campaign needs to use this video to show plagiarism Joe Biden!
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
I have a hard time believing Biden uses the word "monolith" in a sentence in a coherent way. Someone's writing this for him.

Please learn from the mistakes you made in 2016. If you had to report on this, the story should be: “Joe Biden clarified some comments he made earlier today.” Then you should’ve moved on to the fact that you’ve stopped reporting about the bounties Putin paid on our troops
The key difference I’d note is that between Biden and Bernie types, a night at a protest with a bunch of anarchists will push a Bernie supporter even more left real quick. A Biden supporter would just peace police the whole time.

Trump literally makes me shudder with revulsion, but then, so does Biden.
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
The main plus Joe Biden has over Hilary Clinton as the nominee is that he doesn’t have the baggage of her scandals. Picking Susan Rice undoes that by bringing back Benghazi which is why she’s the perfect pick for the Democrats
Trump tried to lose in 2016. Neither of these guys want the job, but their egos won't let them quit.  Someday, we'll find out whose idea it was for Biden to run. It sure as fuck wasn't Joe's.
ok so, Biden is tripping over himself trying to backtrack being super racist earlier, Trump just banned Fortnite and LoL, PPB is threatening feral children with violence on Twitter, and Ted Wheeler is declaring “it’s all good everyone we fixed racism anyway go Blazers!”

These blunders and Freudian slips from Biden no matter how much they try to back pedal them, come from a long standing assumption that the Democrats feel the black community vote is a given. Imho.

It would be funny if the GOP are running Kanye West in hopes he takes votes from Biden - instead Kanye takes votes from tRump
That’s nothing compared to what people from spaceships will do to malignant narcissists.  Biden will be informed once the aliens have left our system that they collected a few for study, and left a document saying they knew that we could not do that to other humans, but they can.
CNN has an article about Trumps thinking being impaired but makes no reference to Biden talking about black people not being diverse. Fox legit rips on Trump way more than CNN covers anything negative on the left.
No “sorry.” You know who you are, a racist. 👇🏽
Also why did Biden have multiple tweets throughout the day before “clarifying”? Wouldn’t you think that would be at the top of his priorities? And why not do it in the air? A tweet is so disingenuous

Nothing new. That is who he is. A racist. 👇🏽
Biden will let you keep your black card
45s claim that Biden will “hurt God” is not just a ludicrous statement about Biden...it also implies that in his mind he is “helping God”...he indeed sees himself as an American savior of sorts. All of this is antithetical to the kingdom of God.
The test isn't necessary.  Nobody credible is accusing Joe Biden of being completely demented.  They only have people who are observed displaying the symptoms of dementia take that test.
Why is he so uniquely special? He’s doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden’s help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say “Trump” in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
Imagine thinking that Biden wanted any single one of these things lmao

What did blacks have to lose..50 years of following the party that started the KKK..the party that had a KKK leader in the Senate..the party that filibustered the Civil Rights Bill..yeah keep thinking they will change, but Biden shows his racist side every day..
I don’t trust any republicans. Not even the Lincoln Project. When Biden wins they will start ripping him apart.
Saw a pic of joe biden, trump, and Epstein at The Sharing in the 90s 🤷‍♂️
Biden should just come out as a Republican already.
Didn’t he say how Catholics love their 2nd Amendment? Biden’s Catholic, sooo...that argument is out the door.
I reported ALL his tweets about this shit. He's a right wing Fox contributor.  Joe Biden clarified his tweets, they're on my feed.
If Biden is capable of hurting the all-powerful creator of the entire universe, like daaaamn! I thought he was just a bumbling racist egotistical moron!
Nobody and I mean nobody really believes Joe Biden is gonna push a radical left agenda. #weirdstrategy
The classic position of a Catholic like Biden.  Hurt the Bible. Hurt God.
So according to Trump, Joe Biden, a devout gun-owning Catholic, is both weak yet more powerful than God.
He won’t get away with the predatory rapist stalking that he did during the Hillary debates when he debates Biden.
Anyway, definitely voting for Biden regardless, but I'm not letting go of a feminist woman or man (e.g., Castro) winning the primary and then the presidency in the regular way on the merits in my life.
Yes, for sure! I don't mean to take anything away from her and (perversely) I talked to so many women phone-banking who voted for Biden because they were terrified of seeing their faves destroyed like she was but didn't care if he was.
What we deserved this year was a primary between the candidates of the future where the two geriatric white men stood down rather than sucking up all the air in the room. I am hopeful we can have that in 2024. (and this is not to say I'm opposed to supporting Biden's VP pick!).
Sorry, but ZERO conservatives will be voting for Biden the buffoon.    In fact, no one in their right mind would vote for Biden’s brain.
Except for when Biden says that black people aren’t as diverse as Hispanics
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist
Only the first one was racist. The other two are taken out of context.  The Latin comment was about the various countries they come from (Latin America) which isn’t the case for many black Americans DUE TO SLAVERY.  Biden saying Americans are racist against Asians isn’t racist.
the misogyny from the Trump campaign/cartel once Biden names his VP is going to be unreal. on a scale that makes ‘16 look tame. just brace yourselves
Plus the whole rant about Biden taking away the 2nd amendment. And saying with Joe we’ll “have no guns, bibles, no anything”.  And even though he claims Joe is in cognitive decline, he still says Biden is powerful enough to hurt God. He’s is down to cult &amp; kin supporters only.
The only person Biden could pick that would change my vote would be Trump.
Say what you will about Biden, at least he apologizes... which really is such a low bar of expectation for the two old white men who are running for the highest seat of power in this country to meet.
Tezlyn says Bernie Sanders is "WEAK" for selling #MedicareForAll pipe dream cos it won't happen under Joe Biden presidency. Trumpy!  68% of Americans WANT #MedicareForAll.  EVERY #ExitPoll Americans said REPLACE #ACA with #MedicareForAll and that was BEFORE #CoronaVirus Pandemic
If you believe that Kamala Harris should not be Biden’s VP pick because she’s “too aggressive”...unfollow me now!   THIS 👇🏼👇🏼 is what America is going to need when WE THE PEOPLE clean out the sewage Trump left behind. #BidenHarris2020
Still lying to your death-cult I see.
other white folks on my tl saying "if you don't vote for biden you don't care about oppressed communities" lmao okay bc he plans to do a lot of good for them
I honestly don’t know what I want more, Biden to win and trump end up in jail or Trump to win to teach the  a lesson.
"Joe Biden's faith is at the core of who he is; he's lived it with dignity his entire life"...  That's all you have to read. It doesn't take a "woke" person to know this is a bunch of malarkey.
Biden be like:
Biden should invite all the accusers to the debate, might not be enough room with social distancing.
'God could my dad drive an ice cream cone. Oof.'  -Joe Biden
No.  Biden is hurting Biden.
wake up.. that's not how Joe Biden got votes.. in fact, Joe Biden earned ZERO delegates from the first 3 contests... then Obama stepped in and put a stop to it because the PEOPLE said they want to replace #ACA with #MedicareForAll and that would have messed with HIS LEGACY.
Biden is the most corrupt public servant of all time and he got caught. Why would we want him as president.
I don't think Biden sleeps with porn stars. Donald is the one that hurts God
What's Bidens record? Name one thing he has done? Why go to such lengths to defend a racist like Biden?
Only fools and opportunists confuse Biden’s maturity and humility with weakness. No one is perfect, but someone IS a narcissistic, sociopathic megalomaniac, and it sure as heck ain’t Joe.
One of the issues of the day is that there's a range of political views within the Black community -- as in any community -- but liberals and centrists often privilege conservative Black voices as representing the whole. So that's part of the problem with what Biden said.
I want the bumper sticker...”Biden 2020 — He’s against God and Guns!”
What if Joe Biden shot someone on 5th Avenue would people care then?
I feel we as a party need to be more pragmatic  and less puritanical. Biden's not perfect. Harris is not perfect, but they're who we got and they're better than the incumbent. Simple as that.
And that’s not even on a policy level (which I disagree a lot with). I dont think Biden is the president to staunch the slow creep of fascism.
💯. And I frankly just don’t think Biden is up to the challenge of this moment.
Let me get this straight.   Joe Biden basically states that black Americans are all the same, on camera, multiple times...  And everyone is worried about how POTUS pronounces words?  🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🇺🇸💯
Isn’t the Corvette the best? Great cars! I’m for Joe Biden 2020!!!
What do you think is causing Biden to implode? It seems like at this point everything bad associated with him is baked in and people don’t care
If you vote for anyone other than #Biden it is a vote for #Trump.
No one who votes for him was ever going to vote for Biden
I think it’d depend on the degree. I’m dating a Bernie voter as a Biden voter. But neither of us would date a Trump voter or even a Romney voter.
Media needs you to think Biden is inevitable, landslide Joe.
The fake-"progressive" scum on twitter are already losing their collective fake-ass shit over the possibility that Rice will be Biden's VP pick with RawStory's piece about her divesting herself of her Netflix stock.
Biden said “no you don’t need to toot cocaine to have fun at the sock hop!” and it wasn’t even his weirdest quote of the day.
Your party's candidate just today said that african americans have no diversity. At least fox news reports that. Your socialist news channels like msdnc won't even report that biden literally said that in an interview
Biden’s tweets would be way better if they were written like a newspaper issuing a correction.   “Earlier today, Joe Biden made some comments...”

Listen y’all, I know this shit is crazy, it’s hard and it’s freaking exhausting but the alternative is much MUCH worse so let’s do whatever we need to do to fuel up and get us to that Nov finish line. We got this.  NO SLEEP TILL BIDEN!!!
So sad to see Biden. Why does the Dem party keep pushing poor candidates? Same problem w/A.B.C. (Anybody.But.Clinton) Trump IS still our best choice. Promises kept-he’s done a great job.
It's obvious why GOP wants a short term skinny bill: if they lose in Nov. and pandemic is still raging, they will do everything in their power to obstruct and sabotage a Biden admin so they can pass blame for their failures to govern.
True, but it's not that clear cut. "Biden...opposed some parts of the law, even while he helped write it. ...he reportedly called a three-strikes provision ... 'wacko' and illustrative of Congress’ 'tough on crime' attitude."
They are hoping he takes votes away from Biden.🤬
45 IS INSANE.  Donald Trump claims Joe Biden is 'against God;' Biden aides call Trump a hypocritical divider
So, by trump’s account Biden is against God and guns as if God is a big proponent of the NRA.
I agree, but at this point I would prefer someone qualified to a fresh face.  Also, when Biden is inevitably impeached/resigns from cognitive decline, I would rather Rice in the oval office than Harris.
What happened to decency and humanity? We won’t see any of that until Biden is POTUS. #maddow

To be fair, literal transcripts of most people will make them seem much less coherent than they seem live. Verbal pauses and fillers are everywhere.  But since the context is about whether Biden is slipping, editing out numerous stumbles without comment is an interesting choice.
Actual Biden: "Anyway, I am, uh, I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental fil--my physical as well as my mental fil--fitness..."  Article Quote: "I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical and mental fitness..."
Joe Biden lacks the mental capacity to serve as a president, yet he’s powerful enough to get rid of God. Okay, got it.
Biden’s going to get roasted! It’s not even fair 😂
Trump, Biden, LaPierre; STFU!
I worry about that, too. Rice is the best qualified IMO but if Biden wants to win over any of the right, Benghazi will turn them away. I think she’d be better as CoS or Sec of State.
I hear God is in the ICU. Biden must have got him good.
Joe Biden is so religious that his crime bill expanded the federal penalty for crimes not involving murder....
If closing arguments are: Biden/Rice and Ebola/Benghazi vs Trump and Covid that’s an easy argument to make. ~10 Americans died between Ebola/Benghazi. It’ll be well over 200k American Covid deaths by Election Day.
i dunno man, according to him, biden's the one out here hurting god
Kanye confirms the obvious: That he’s trying to hurt Biden &amp; help fellow nutjob trump. But, honestly, anyone dumb enough to vote for Kanye was probably a trumpie anyway.
So if Biden’s VP pick doesn’t meet with your approval, you would prefer Pence????
LaPierre, Biden, Trump; STFU!
Yeah, I’m honestly not convinced if I’m one of the candidates that I *necessarily* want to be Biden’s pick
And at least Biden knows how to use quote marks. You use of them on “dumb” is dumb.
Hmm. I wonder who African Americans favor in the presidential race? 80% Biden and 6% Trump.
As a Man if Latin origin, I am appalled and offended to not be thought of as a homogeneous voting bloc like the rest of black america, Biden needs to step up his racism, how else will I know who to vote for?
Well Crazy Joe Biden did it again. Makes the case for Pat Paulsen or Gais Baltar.
The most I expect of biden at this point is, potentially(!), a semi-competent path out of pandemic purgatory.
Biden could choose Snail for his VEEP and I will still pick Biden!
I'm impressed by the intense editing here to make Biden sound more coherent in the write-up than in the actual video:  Video Biden: "I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity..."  Article Biden: "I’m so ...  looking [forward] to have an opportunity..."
Settling for Biden gives zero incentive for the dnc to change their bad behavior and start pushing better people. You have what? 70 million? 80 million? Democrats in this country and the one you’re expected to rally behind is Biden?
He blocked me for telling him why his entire theory of supporting Biden to push him left was crap.
Your President remains basically clueless in regards to what it takes to change a constitutional amendment. Biden or anybody else ever will get the 2nd Amendment changed. Legislation might limit some guns, Ammo and magazine sizes, but take them away never.
Are you f-I g kidding me??? At this point it’s Biden’s VP pick that will have you decide to vote against the most corrupt, dishonest, uninformed, destroyer of our Republic ever to hold office?? EAJE THE FUCK UP!
At which point you get to my perspective which is “I don’t want to vote for Biden but I will anyway because the alternative is so much more terrifying”
Doesn't want to do this anymore, he's desperately trying to gaffe his way to freedom from evil Democrat handlers. But there's no escape, they'll keep covering for him.  #Biden
Biden is definitely a Catholic, but the Catholic Church may no longer be catholic.
America-hating Marxists don’t want Biden either
Despite Biden believing in god and owning a gun, I will still vote for him.
I've scene more Bernie signs than but that's not surprising... There is no excitement for Biden... Unlike Hillary or Obama... Biden wins Oregon... But if people here aren't excited for him... He has a tough hill to climb...
Back in 2008 Obama was the Exciting Candidate. He chose Biden as the Experienced Insider to ground his message. But Biden is not an exciting candidate. He is Return to Normal Guy. He will need a running mate who will motivate people.
I lost all respect for  after reading that.  If she chooses not to vote for Biden, that’s one more vote for Trump.  You don’t have to love his VP pick to know you don’t want 4 more years of this insanity!

Weird that the GOP is attacking Biden for refusing not to age.  Is this supposed to help with seniors?
I will cry tears of joy—and on January 21, help the administration of President Biden with all the strength I can muster.
I wish Biden would just pick a VP already. This long run-up feels needlessly combative for some reason. The ticket should have been Warren/Harris, but since it's not and we're all just... voting for Biden, just pick one! Preferably Warren or Harris. They are all qualified women.
Your father would be voting for Biden.
If you can't say the name, you can't make the claim.  I've seen a lot of people quoted as "insiders" who are about as close to the Biden camp as Trump is.
"Manufacturing" means continued reliance on oil that we'll have to purchase from Putin under an R administration.  Biden will sign the Paris Agreement and restore our dignity in the world. Green New Deal for America!

Tough on real crimes. Biden crime bill locked up people for life and ruined lives with no hope of getting rehabilitation. It caused MASS INCARCERATION. It most especially hurt black and brown people. It’s disgusting that he can deny it now.
I've been worried about this kind of thinking from Biden. He doesn't have to do anything other than let the indictments against Trump and his family proceed once he's out of office.
All you're saying is they can shove anyone down our throats, because the alternative is Trump. That's already been done with Biden. This pick will probably determine who heads the Dems party, and maybe who is president, through the next almost decade.

I always regret not sticking to my original plan of avoiding Biden as much as possible so I can hold my nose and vote for him. Ugh.
He could have mentioned it SOONER. He lied saying that Obama didn't leave a playbook. But it was proven Obama/Biden did leave one. He never shut the country down. He wanted to open it back up.

For a man like Trump to claim Joe Biden is going to "hurt the Bible, and hurt God" himself if he becomes our next president just shows how desperate &amp; faithless Trump is in every way. Nothing is sacred to him, &amp; his sole motivating desire is to be worshipped 👉Deuteronomy 32:17

occured long after she came forward and said he had harassed her and nothing came of it. While the allegations of unwanted touching have already been acknowledged by Biden and his team, plenty of evidence points to her being completely full of shit.
Biden's not against 'energy', he's for 'matter'. BLM as an example.
Again, wrong. One said she was told about harassment, not rape. The fifth (I’ll assume it was her brother that you cited) was not quoted in the article. Every accusation against Biden is for creepy, unwanted touching and Reade (coincidentally a Putin supporter) said penetration
He really out here saying Biden is gonna attack and dethrone god huh?
Guess The Recount hasn't listened to any of the Biden interviews or Pelosi' press conferences.  Seem to be a trend the Politicians don't speak English anymore.
I will take an even odds bet right now that the next Dem presidental nominee will be whoever is Biden's VP. So who Biden picks as VP is huge huge hugely significant.
Nobody is saying you're incapable of voting for Biden.  Just pointing out that supporting Biden means supporting the fascist approach that he represents.  Voting for the blue fascist to remove the red fascist is not a solution.
Biden is a centrist who is not campaigning on the values of democrat voters. Biden does not back M4A, legalization of marijuana, or defunding the police/police reform.

We literally just saw Biden win the primary despite being relatively out of step with the mainstream of the party on some issues mainly because he was once the VP. Yet people still think the VP is unimportant
Biden or Trump, the result is the same:  We fight them with everything we have.
I’d bet she’s not alone. Republicans will reliably pick party over country every single time. It was true in 2016 too: pussy grabber&gt; Hillary. At least then you could argue Hillary appeared corrupt. If you can’t vote for Biden in 2020 after 160,000 dead and 33% GDP decline- FU

Biden isn't the choice most of us would have made given our druthers but to say that he isn't much better than Trump....
Nope. He has never been accused of rape, full stop. 3 of her 5 witnesses said they were never even told about it. Making sexual advances and then stopping when realizing that the feelings are not reciprocated is not rape.
I only wish I could count on Biden to attack and dethrone god. 😒
Looking forward to my timeline filled with folks that have a newly acquired thousand followers where they have to explain why Trump and Biden are both bad
Yeah Trump says Biden will destroy God. We can't have that.
I would force myself to wait if it was for the right candidate, but definitely would not wait in line to vote for Biden.
What if both Trump and Biden get covid and Kanye is the last candidate standing?
Biden can pick The Rock or a rock for this VP and it will still be better than Trump and Pence. Are you even serious with this argument?!
Is there a way that  could have  committed?? He is a threat to the country and running just to fuck up Biden and help Trump. Do the right thing, Kim, cause you know it's just matter of time before he blows up your family
Joe Biden loves black people so much, he just wants to give them a big old 9 minute bear hug right around the neck.
Have fun with that, I guess. We'll be over here building a party that doesn't cater to the corporate fascists that are funding Biden and Trump.  I want to stop Trump, but I also want to stop Biden.  You can't fight fascism by voting for fascists, whether red or blue.

Our local cops are covering their badges and assaulting our citizens en masse with impunity. Biden has said nothing to indicate that he finds this problematic.  Anarchists peacefully protesting are folks he considers legitimate targets.  Again, how is Biden better?
The real message about Biden and Obama they are selling is "Democrats are godless" despite all the time they went to church. Which I'm always surprised anyone buys.
also, not for nothing, Hillary Clinton  Hillary and Biden and Obama are all three GENUINELY religious people, with a spiritual practice and regular faith traditions and a deep foundation of knowledge and theology  wild to see that none of that matters
Lost some Big name Politicians that I was following. Graetz, Jordan Huckabee, Marshburn etc. But picked up Wyden, Merkley and a Biden supporter. It'll take me a day or two to figure out.
He’s making Biden sound fucking awesome
Biden says out loud that he would veto Medicare For All if it was signed and placed on his desk.  There is no reason to suspect that Biden will be better.
My dog would be an adequate Biden VP pick compared to ANY chance Trump gets reelected.
Wow. Millions infected and out of work, no rule of law any longer, a fully corrupt administration headed by a drooling mafia-boss-wannabe, and you won’t vote for Biden unless you approve his VP choice? You just lost a fan.
Kamala Harris was perfectly positioned for him in all ways... except she’s a cop right at the moment anti-police sentiment boiled over. Good luck to them, would not want to be on the Biden campaign team 😂
I absolutely despise Trump, but if the Democratic Party  nominates Biden they are asking for this, and they will deserve the consequences.  Biden is not fit to be the nominee and the sooner we #ReplaceBiden the better.
Biden is a prime architect of the legal framework that permits Trump to exercise authoritarian tendencies.  Biden is also a prime architect of numerous overseas conflicts, and is compromised in ways eerily similar to Trump.  The differences aren't as stark as the similarities.
I love and respect Ted Cruz, but if Trump can beat him with Trump’s dirty style of debating, then Biden will be like a dog playing with a rag doll
Ben Shapiro warns Biden 'falling apart' after bizarre interview, would be 'ripped up and down' if Republican  #FoxNews
That's awesome.  At least Biden won't even know he is being bashed LOL
Lmao you think trump is going to do any better!? Why does trump get a pass? Wake up! Biden may not be the best but he is &gt; than trump without a doubt
You'll vote Blue. Whether they win or not we could all be damned. The reality is that Biden and Trump work for the same people, and prefer the same policies. They just argue about who to blame for their failures.  I'm not expecting Biden to change his stripes. Why are you?
Yeah he cages children, tells people to drink bleach, enriches himself at the detriment to the nation, panders to Nazis.... but if Biden pick a girl that’s too icky, it’s a deal breaker🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄fuck outa here
Love this! Let's lean in to Biden being the only Democrat boomers like and get Florida on election night.
The Green Party already has ballot access in enough states to win the electoral college.  If you want to look at Biden's numbers on social media, be my guest.  Either #ReplaceBiden or #VoteGreen #BidenIsAFascist #BidenIsARacist
I used to think that way too. But I no longer believe it’s possible to break our binary system simply by throwing away votes for the presidency...  To be clear: I loathe our two party system! But in 2020, the only sane choice is Biden. 2024 we can be idealistic again.
Biden is just a way to continue the slide into fascism.  Crime Bill, Patriot Act, Bankruptcy Bill, and so much more.  Not to mention Biden's penchant for overseas conflict.  You really sure he is the lesser evil?  You really sure you want to vote for evil?  We must do better.
is that video of Biden talking about cars supposed to make him seem charming and not sad
The behavior also draws attention to their own limitations (e.g. "Biden can't think straight, he's cognitively impaired) - it's just  constant projection.  It's exhausting, and narcissists never stop doing this; you can set your watch by it and know exactly what's coming.
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Switch parties and I will put you in as Biden’s VP choice. You can get what you want done from there.
"I heard you kids were talking a lot about cops lately, so I'm going to give them a raise and I'm making a cop my VP!  And they say I'm out of touch.  Pfft." - Biden, probably.
Will joe Biden pay for the destruction of black communities?
Between the two, only one was subjected to a cognitive test by doctors who were concerned his cognitive ability, and it wasn’t Biden.    This is what you’re puffing your chest up about???  PERSON. WOMAN. MAN. DESPERATION....
My family, friends, and community are just as screwed with Biden as they are with Trump. Biden might even be worse.  You would vote for Hitler if he was a Democrat running against Trump. That's the sad part.  #NeverSettle
I'm very, very, worried about God right now. He text me saying he's concerned that no one will come when he dials 911 if Biden is elected. "What am I supposed to do, send my Son out there to die for others??"
Show me, on the doll, where Joe Biden hurt God:
Biden will confiscate anyway. BTW gun registration isn't needed. Democrats will check Visa/MasterCard ammo and gun accessories sales records. Gun show attendance records at public facilities. Gun magazine and organization membership lists, etc.
Campaigns are literally the *only* thing Ted Wheeler cares about. He doesn’t wanna be mayor, he just wants to be hipster mayo pete and get a nice cabinet gig. Maybe Biden can put him in charge of teargas!#teargasted
I don't see that much downside, but I don't see any upside.  If you like Biden already, you're fine with Rice.  I don't see her shoring up any category at all, and she's not a "retail politician" that we know of--and that might help a bit.
So compare Biden's anti-Blackness to Trump's anti-Blackness.   With Biden there is hope for change despite his personal views.  With Trump there is certain change to his personal views.  Which do you want?
Shit, somebody better warn God about Joe Biden.
absolutely cannot wait to see how we defend "Biden will hurt God" hurry up weird con army
Biden is the reason Trump had the authority to engage in these fascist tactics. Rewarding the Democratic Party for kneecapping a whole generation is not the answer.  If you actually oppose fascism, you oppose it regardless of party affiliation. #NeverBidenNeverTrump

“Biden has whispered into many women’s ears. He’s also touched women’s faces and necks during other photo ops.”OK , that may be one of the dumbest comments ever made about Joe Biden and Black voters. We know what Joe meant, you on the other hand are just to dumb to know what he meant. Blacks support Biden, period, finish, end of story.

Trump’s latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional — even for him
Anyone else think Dems trying this before the election is misguided? I can see people not vote for Biden over this because he has already said the little boy  is going to be in charge of taking guns from citizens.

Joe Biden will longer accept the Democratic presidential nomination in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the Democratic National Convention, officials said today. Biden will instead accept the Democratic nomination for president from his home state of Delaware.

How has it run its course ?  No one has ever been held accountable, but then that’s typical with our government regardless of who’s in power.  I’d think real hard on this, because Biden won’t make it through his first year, so this pick will end up as President.

It’s not just Trump supporters. I was called an idiot by someone insisting Biden will be just as as bad as Trump. Some people are too cynical for their own good.  There’s also the need to be right and make others wrong which so many people so quickly fall into. All about ego.
So tired of people that insisting this country will be just as bad with Biden as President. The cynicism and apathy present here is appalling.
Realistic? Reality is whatever we want to create. Electing Biden is a small step in a huge process. Everything begins with a vision. If we sell ourselves short before we’ve even started, then we’ve already lost.
I've noticed that most of Trump's campaign commercials just point out how much better Biden is than Trump.

Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
Liar- Biden doesn’t stand for the radical left-wing. It’s just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
I seriously ... what we got vs. what Biden might be ... hell, who's his running mate?  They'll be president not long after Biden takes over if he gets it.
Stephen Miller’s plan was to separate children from parents and have white parents adopt and raise them. It’s chilling and more chilling that we ignore it as a country. Biden has much to reverse once in office
Good morning! I’m still not voting for biden, fuck the Portland police, now it’s time for coffee✌️
We will have 166 days of very heightened vigilance after Biden wins. That will be the most dangerous 166 days in our history
Kamala's job if selected as Biden's running mate will be to articulate Biden's platform.
I care desperately for people to quit allowing neolibs to define the choices for you. It is not Trump or Biden unless you fall for that.
Biden loves him
Biden hates black people. He’s an old school white supremacist.
According to the centrists “It’s just the way Biden talks and Joe being Joe Biden”🙄.  Sound familiar?🤨. I’m voting for the lame moron but Warren and Sanders would’ve been much better presidents if elected.  Can’t wait for 2024 Democratic primary!
Yes, I’m 62 yrs old, diabetic &amp; I smoke cigarettes, I will quit when Biden wins in November. I might have to wait until January bc trumps voice &amp; antics, being pathological liar, constantly embarrassing us along w/ #ComplicitCorruptGOP makes me smoke more, UGH!! Can I sue them?
Trump. I know. But it’s the lesser of two evils. And Biden is BAD
Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
Joe "the racist" biden
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? 😅 Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
Joe Biden's staff wrote that apology/explanation. They recognized his gaffe manufactured a response for him.
Biden’s going to hurt the Bible?! 😂
Why is he so uniquely special? He’s doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden’s help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say “Trump” in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist
Media needs you to think Biden is inevitable, landslide Joe.
He blocked me for telling him why his entire theory of supporting Biden to push him left was crap.
#BidenIsRacist #Biden said racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."  He prevented thousands of children from receiving better educations and more opportunities in life #WhiteSupremacist
Biden is an old school true white supremacist and racist
Biden was against school integration and said that racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."
Tough on real crimes. Biden crime bill locked up people for life and ruined lives with no hope of getting rehabilitation. It caused MASS INCARCERATION. It most especially hurt black and brown people. It’s disgusting that he can deny it now.
I greatly respect  and I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, but the words "binary choice" are just wrong. There are at least three candidates for President better than both Trump and Biden.  #NeverTrump #NeverBiden
Biden's not against 'energy', he's for 'matter'. BLM as an example.
please NO #SUSANRICE. The potential president after Joe Biden ISNT Susan Rice. Karen Bass is. She and  have plans to restore our nation. They’ve both proven they’ve delivered &amp; will continue
What if both Trump and Biden get covid and Kanye is the last candidate standing?
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Not Republicans but Trump's lawyers!  He is trying to divide the votes to keep Biden from a victory.
WaPo desperate to get Biden elected, Obama’s third term.
He’s absolutely wacko and sounds very, very desperate.  Grabbing at everything he can think of to try to disparage Biden.  Guns, God, Energy.  All in the same breath.
The whole spectacle of Biden is an embarrassment to the United States. Less so than Trump, who is daily actively destroying our government and our assets. But we need someone who will rebuild knowledge and capability instead of destruction.
Censorship is the prime tool to elect Biden, Obama’s third term
Had a dream Michelle Obama surprised everyone and ran w Biden. Far out shit man. Time to log out.
Trump campaign ad features doctored images of Joe Biden 'in his basement, alone'  via
Why introduce a straw man?  We're talking about demanding more from Biden, not the #OrangeTroll.
Twitter is big part of Joe Biden campaign to eliminate and censor any views they don’t approve of. Obama wants third term.
This could peel away Republican voters that were considering Biden. Timing on this was bad.
This is really concerning. The strategy is to pull off one to 2% of the black vote in swing States like Wisconsin and Ohio away from Biden. Is there anything happening within the black community itself to counteract this measure?
Sundown Syndrome, you mean?  We call it "Alzheimer's Disease" now but it's still very real.  A friend who was an elderly care nurse says #JimCrowJoe has all the symptoms.  Why is Biden saying the Black community is monolithic?
The timing on this is terrible! Republicans that were considering voting for Biden will now peel off. Why are Dems so willing to shoot themselves in the foot in an election cycle.
What do you feel Biden will do about the issues #BlackLivesMatter is fighting for? Do you believe Black lives matter to Biden?
Joe Biden doesn’t treat women as sexual objects for one!! Trump has had everything given to him, threatens people for other things, lied and cheated and he’s failed at all businesses he’s own. It’s taken executives at banks and others who invested with him to bail him out!!
He is pending on the ballot in Wisconsin. They want to pull students away from voting for Biden.
Bernie Sanders was never pro-segregation. He was actively against it and was arrested protesting housing discrimination in Chicago. Desegregating housing would have also solved school segregation.  Equating Bernie and Biden on race is really dishonest.
She's saying Biden is a white supremacist who favors locking up all the Black men because he thinks they're junkies.  Better?
Comparing Warren and Biden to Bernie Sanders on race is insulting and either intellectually dishonest or very uneducated on actual policy.  Warren and Biden are white supremacists.
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Why? Why would they now be coming out of woodwork but before there was no suits whatsoever? Because this is what the GOP does, they find people from Biden’s past willing to take money to make an accusation. The GOP even for a woman to come out against Mueller and a guy against
Please, if there were any truth to these allegations Biden would have been sued just like Trumpnwas dozens, of not hundreds of times civilly over these supposed assaults. People these days sue if they have a groeviemce of this nature but none and I mean none of these woman sues
I want to be clear about something: I will vote for Biden this fall. Is he my first choice? NO. Our primary hadn't happened before everyone else dropped out. He's our ONLY real choice. I'm not happy, it's not ideal. But until the left can be really united, this is our choice.
You’re kidding yourself if you don’t think the crime bill hurt blacks much more than whites and target blacks. Watch how Biden speaks and what a disgusting pig he is the way he speaks of black children!
That’s an area of vast difference between progressives and Biden and Bernie. They both want to give the cops more money. They’re wrong.  The cops have too much money.
Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was being kept safely tucked away. He recently went on tv again.  What do you think?
What could possibly go wrong for Biden now?
Biden’s plan is more ACA subsidies to predatory insurance companies and lowering the Medicare age to 60. More Medicaid expansion.  You’re confusing Biden with Bernie.
Is Biden going to debate Trump??
Biden needs to debate Trump, which they will never let him, because it’s going to be a huge train wreck. #BidenHasDementia
Trump lowered the price of insulin and Biden is against #MedicareForAll, so I doubt he’s a one issue voter.
No one is speaking in Milwaukee. They chose to speak from their respective cities because of Covid. He’s not hiding in his basement. That pic that Trump touted is photoshopped.
Yeah I noticed that the last time I watched it. How disgusting! Biden is an awful person. Even with dementia, he can’t help himself from showing his true thoughts on black people.
Sorry, but Biden is clearly anti FDR. This bullshit is offensive.
Has been changed and it’s been so many decades! Democrats like Biden did things like the Biden crime bill that sent soooo many black men to prison. The 3 strikes you’re out laws also!
I’ll be unpopular and point out the way Biden has dragged this out and waited has largely contributed to the internal strife about his pick is imo
It is very clear that Biden is suffering mental decline.
Obama, Biden and Clinton’s.
Basement Biden will be in jail over Ukraine, and then there is lying and treason for spying.
Are her “dances” signals to Biden that it’s time to say something stupid and racist again?
Alzheimer’s is a very specific type of dementia. Dementia is a brain disease. It’s not a mental illness. Unless Biden is diagnosed, it won’t be known what type of dementia he has specifically.
let’s face it. You have a distinct opportunity to affect billions of lives and direction of the population. Join Biden for election. Establish help to ease process burden. We need just, thoughtful sanity in US and beyond. Regards.
This is not sitting well we us Americans. It just another nail in his coffin as a President. Biden 2020
It’s we Americans thinks it’s time for you to leave. America we be great again when Biden wins
I understand all of it except for the last part. “Push him around” is he talking about Biden, I’m assuming??
If he does, it’s not as advanced as Biden’s is. 🤷🏻‍♀️. Biden is really far gone at this point.
If having advanced dementia is cool, Biden is 💯
Biden has advanced staged dementia 🤦🏻‍♀️
You can’t possibly love this country if you’re voting for Biden in November. 🤷🏻‍♀️
💯!!!! Biden is the epitome of a shire supremacist
Joe Biden is a racist. He always has been. Look up the Biden crime bill. And, there are countless videos where you can see him saying the most racist things. He is a white supremacist.
Biden is going to actively break the left. If necessary, he'll purge the Dems the way Obama did. Dems lost 1K offices while Obama was President and it wasn't because they were "too ambitious."  He let people lose.
CNN is part of the Biden campaign for Obamas third term.
I assume I can't just pick "who do I think should be President" in this scenario (probably Romney - sorry :) ). Of plausible Dems before Biden limited, Klobuchar (who I would have preferred over Biden for POTUS). Between Rice and Harris, I'm not certain. It's hard for me...
Who? I know that the Dems think it will get Biden voted into office, but it’s doing the opposite.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
It's no different than Joe Biden giving paid speeches on behalf of Fred Upton when Upton was running for re-election. It's no different than Beto O'Rourke refusing to campaign against Will Hurd.  It's a big club and they're all in it. They're protecting the senior members.
I’m not okay with that. I switched parties 2 months ago, after I saw how insane and evil the Dems are. But, if I didn’t and was voting blue, I can’t imagine being okay with voting for dementia Biden and assuming who is running the show is someone I like.
I'm intrigued. Who, exactly, are these voters that a) take the time to vote; and b) think "Biden was my guy, but Yeezy is on my ballot!"?   (and who are the GOPers that are willing to spend money on this idea?)
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
Not overlooking anything with Biden- Trump’s mentally unwell and unstable to be leading along with being a sexist misogynist, racist, xenophobe, homophobe who is using his position for his own family’s position and wealth. trump befriends all fascists. DISGUSTING you’d vote Trump
Wasn’t Biden friends with a KKK member or leader?
Ok. Trump has 25 allegations by women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has been recorded on Howard Stern and in other interviews making these misogynistic statements and those that sexualize his own daughter. You have videos of Biden hugging girls and kissing their heads.
I voted for Bernie in 2016 and would have in May if that was allowed in Oregon as an independent.  However as a Black male I can’t contemplate voting for IT and his White Supremacist agenda.  This time its Joe Biden or face the phase two of a 4th Reich.  It’s that serious.
"November 4th is too late. We should hold Joe Biden accountable now."  -    I really have to wonder why  is waiting for him to win. They should be at his door right now and demanding he sign on to Bernie's platform across the board.  Or no votes.
. source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
It appears that the Dems and MSM have infinite passes for Biden.
Truthfully I like she and Elizabeth Warren the best.  But Joe Biden won’t go wrong with any of the 8 women he is considering.  Gretchen Wilmer is also impressive.  I am Black but don’t believe he HAS to select a Black woman...selecting a woman who could run the country is #1!
In all due respect for Biden- why should democratic candidates be tested, show birth certificates, taxes and be held at a higher standard than the corrupt baffoon in office?
Also Biden: C'mon man, are you a junkie?
Purely in terms of strategy, Harris seems like the obvious choice for Biden (not who I would prefer). Passes C-in-C test, voters know her to enough of a degree that it prevents defining her, least likely to depress any bloc of voters. Leaves election as referendum on POTUS.
Could he cede now so Biden can lead us out of a pandemic?
Me: Joe Biden is not the best the Democrats can do. Liberals: What do you mean? Me: Dementia, for one. Liberals: That's a Bernie Bro hoax!   Hold my beer.
If they take their month recess and leave us hanging out here NO ONE will vote Republican. They would return in Sept to all schools reopening or not, with no plan, no plan for funding us, no plan for testing, but lots of lies about how awful Biden would be for us.
The media is not covering, Biden is kicking trump's ass without straining. And, since you have a bumbling idiot that lies constantly for a candidate…
And progressive #BLM activist  beat corrupt time server  There’s going to be real pressure on Biden from Congress!
The way I heard it, Reps are encouraging him because they believe that Black voters will defect to him from Biden.  So shortsighted and dumb.
I ran some polls about it, Twitter leftists like Teachout next best after  I will admit that, but I like  because I trust him to fight Biden because of his history of fighting Cuomo.  He was anti-Amazon before anyone.
It’s this simple:  is trying to preserve the GOP majority to give the Democratic Party a built in excuse for not passing progressive legislation if Biden wins.  #ChuckoTheClown needs a serious primary challenger from someone with legislative experience.
I agree with that one big question and I would add one other: who is best positioned to win in 2024?   Opinion | The one thing Joe Biden should think about in a running mate
Joe Biden has advanced dementia!!!
Can we see Biden’s interview next?
Joe Biden is getting briefings. He should be able to confirm or deny.
He want's to be a dictator like his bffs in russia &amp; n. korea
Wow!! Really Bad President Ratings!! Obama wayyy up in the ratings! Biden also surging. Scared Fake News Trump failing and Do-Nothing Republicans can’t help displaced working families feed families due to mismanagement of China Virus. SAD!  &amp;   not a factor...
Wow!! Really Bad President Ratings!! Obama wayyy up in the ratings! Biden also surging. Fake News Trump failing and Do-Nothing Republicans can’t help displaced working families feed families due to embarrassing mismanagement of China Virus. SAD! CNN not a factor. #AmericaOrTrump
"We have Trump in office because socialists want nice things and we mean liberals are willing to re-elect the #OrangeTroll to stop people from getting healthcare!"  Fixed it for you!  Now stop helping Trump win and start pushing Biden for #MedicareForAll!
I agree with   This is something for all my #Resistance followers to consider. Both Presidential candidates have largely the same view of the ongoing uprisings to #AbolishThePolice. So does Congress.  Who benefits from that? How many liberals will buck Biden?
He will, of course, be whining a different tune in November when he loses Frorida to Joe Biden. Then it will be back to "massive voter fraud from mail-in ballots, but absentee ballots were great!"
Got her spotted for Education Secretary. Working with Dr. Jill Biden with vital Education programs gutted by the Nazis, eliminating funding for Private Schools, appropriately
It really is. That was the kind of argument I could expect a real Biden supporter to make, and making it where it would be called out as wrong by  might actually be parody as praxis.
But let’s keep talking about Biden not being all there.
his mouth insanity falls out of it. #TrumpIsNotWell is an accurate and frightening reality. Biden is our choice. We might not like it, hell we might hate it, but voting 3rd party is NOT A CHOICE. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #vote #AmericaWakeUp 3.
Ronna. Please highlight ,in Biden’s plan ,where he said he would defund the police and then post that.  Click-bate much? Monsters. The lot of you.
Yet Biden is the one who can't form complete thoughts right? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Here is a good opinion piece in the WSJ countering NYT. I apologize if there is a paywall. Otherwise you can find it on Twitter.
I hope this comment gets thrown at 45 when he refuses to go to Biden's inaugural. Of course, he would have fled the country by then, to a non extradition destination.
Outside of Twitter, most people haven’t even thought about the question of who will be Biden’s VP.
And then in 2024 we’ll be told “you Have to vote for Biden cause _____ is so bad. Change can come next time” then 2028 it’s “you have to vote for bland no change democrat because _______ is so evil. Change next time.”And on and on the cycle of corporate power continues.
Shucks, Joe Biden will be available after the first week of November
No, the movement took over the Republican Party and elected a "moderate Democrat" President in the guise of a conservative Republican and he turned out to be the fash.  Now the conservatives in both parties want to replace him with far right Joe Biden.
Exactly. After they realized the media wouldn't be able to look the other way if he won South Carolina, they fixed SC for Biden.
Biden still thinks he is VP
Let’s end them before Biden gets destroyed.
Panderingfor Hidin’ Biden, and the dementia parade.
It's true. A lot of white people just refuse to notice what's happening to people who aren't white and think other white people aren't poor.  That's the origin of the horrific "white working class" myth that sticks us with a choice between Biden and Trump.
LMAO, the Pizzagate, QAnon, Seth Rich, Hunter Biden, Obama is a secret Muslim crowd weighs in on conspiracies. 😂
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Yes, he had to compromise significantly with conservative Democrats he should have played hardball with. After he made his deal with the RW Dems he still didn't win any GOP votes.  Biden was telling him to deal with them. Yes, that's on him.
That doesn't really sufficiently address that ridiculous response though.   shouldn't Biden be able to show he cares more than the #OrangeTroll if he wants to be President?
Biden's platform committee already voted on #MedicareForAll and they voted it down. So unless he takes personal action, yes, it's certain #MedicareForAll will not be in the platform.
Some Biden supporters were way more offended than Biden ever was.
If there was a way to tack “Be Smart” above, and a “Vote for Biden” below, might be an improvement.  I’m sure you’ll get some looks that change from smiles to frowns or frowns to smiles. :)
No, he's butthurt because I said he and Joe Biden didn't care. Did you see anything from him that looked like anything but an excuse not to care?
Don't waste your time trying to convince trumpers.  Recruit new people, independents, free thinkers and ex-Republicans to vote for Joe Biden to replace Trump &amp; GOP.
What about the people who already don't have any coverage at all or are severely underinsured because of the ACA?  You're still ignoring them. Like I said, you and Biden don't care any more than Trump did. You just want to check off an insurance box.
Health insurance isn't a guarantee of health coverage, particular under the ACA. Many of the people who will "lose their insurance" already can't use their insurance due to huge deductibles, and still have to pay huge premiums.  Joe Biden isn't offering to fix that problem.
Looks like she hates Biden and Trump. Who can blame her for that?
Check Biden’s basement.
I almost want to know who Biden is considering 4 AG More than I want to know his pick for VP.
Where did you pull out that completely meaningless and obvious statement?  Everyone knows that. Why pat yourself on the back?  Biden is in control of the Democratic platform and has a great deal of say in what happens after he gets elected. So why doesn't he care?
That’s a good question. The problem comes from people not being as stupid as politicians want them to be. They know that, if healthcare is a right, then #MedicareForAll is the minimum required.  Biden keeps saying healthcare is a right. Dem primary voters were fooled too.
It’s true. He doesn’t. Neither does Joe Biden. Why aren’t you pushing him on health care, if you care? 🤔
If you don’t pick demographically correct you’re racist and/or letting Trymp win?  Fucking stupid on their part!  I’m voting Biden no matter what because I DESPISE Trump.  You want my vote ONLY? Or do you want a vote, a campaign contribution, volunteer, activist and enthusiast?
Adam Schaffer’s of course!  Warren should get VP to coalesce the party(finally a PROGRESSIVE!), have excellent policies, and also get an activist base and fundraising that Biden won’t with ANY OTHER of the options.  Harris as AG and Warren’s protege to run for President next
Don't make 400k or more a year. Don't care. Biden's plans directly benefit me. Yours don't
This is really personally disappointing. I have illusions shattered once again.  My Trekker pain aside, you should be pushing Biden to listen to people like  if you really want to beat the #OrangeTroll. If those voters are as important as you say, help them.
Ever hear about vetting? That’s why #trump and his band of incompetences always have, “acting” ppl in charge. He always announces who he wants before they completely check their backgrounds.  VP Biden knows what’s at stake for this presidency.
Unless Biden seeks a second term, then it could be 2028 before he leaves office.
I’d crawl a mile over broken glass to vote AGAINST you no matter what Biden surprise you come up with in November. Yes, you are hated and there’s nothing you can do about it.U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
How about we refuse to recognize the continuing Trump regime and instead recognize Biden as the legitimate President and refuse to cooperate with the U.S. gov until Trump is removed from office, by U.S. military, if necessary?  How about we lobby foreign govs to do the same?
I've waited 8 hours for Biden to say something sane, so why not.
Is it true the Rethuglicans are encouraging your bit of nonsense here to fuck with Biden's chances?  You have to know your chances of being elected are so minuscule as to be less than 0 so you're either ego-driven like Donnie or nuts like Kim keeps saying...
Joe's arriving a bit late to the election reform party. Trump operatives can steal states where no recount is possible because of e-voting. Trump just might win easily. Biden can protest the results, but the MSM will probably just 'sour grapes' all over him. #CluelessJoe.
Actually he's ignoring and refusing almost everything we demand of him. :/ Joe Biden is straight down the middle, completely unbeholden to us radical leftists. His campaign is negotiating with progressives like Bernie Sanders and AOC, but the left is compromising more.
US intelligence accuses Russia, China and Iran of election meddling – live
Counterintelligence chief: Russia aiming to “denigrate” Biden ahead of election  National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said Friday that the Russian government is "using a range of measures"  #RussiaDisinfo #Election2020
Man, if you changed the word "china" to "Mexican, democrat, muslim, Clinton, Obama, Bernie, Biden, or what ever else it is they want you to hate this week"...  It sounds like 2016 all over again.    Can this man win without giving you an "enemy"?
Intelligence community's top election official: China and Iran don't want Trump to win reelection, Russia working against Biden
I’m calling it right now ... Biden is going to pick Obama as his running mate ... Michelle Obama
You know any “debates” will be a reality-based shit show where the content will be how well Biden can withstand rude and threatening moves by Trump.  No content will really be discussed.
I saw a pic of Biden today and genuinely my brain didn’t recognize it as being him. I know he got a facelift but like,,,, why did that change his whole entire face in my head
Biden could believe God an Oreo and he’s have more faith than Trump.
I hope Biden’s team is noticing how much opposition to Kamala Harris there is..
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
The only rationale for this mishandling of this campaign is that some polling office in quasi-DC assured the Biden people that EVERY registered democrat will show up to vote regardless of how pissed-on.  They may be right, but what a horrid lesson to learn from this moment.
Don't you staffers get tired of having to write tweets to make up for Biden's constant stupidity?
Reminder:   Elizabeth Warren is the reason Biden is open to ending the filibuster today.   She successfully pushed him left on this issue.
Joe Biden has definitely flipped his position on this issue. He was staunch against getting rid of the filibuster, now he’s open to it.   Another victory for Elizabeth Warren who helped popularize this idea during the Democratic primaries last year.
Trump keeps talking about crime increasing — on his watch  The Trump campaign has even been running an ad showing images of recent urban unrest and claiming it as proof that "you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."  #Election2020
Bernie: “Proud to endorse progressive black men and women and Muslims who won their primaries”  Biden: “The blacks are a monolith”  Pundits / centrists / libs “Bernie has a real problem with race. Listen to black women and vote Biden!”
...and, if so, my obit will urge folks to vote Biden and all Dems down the ballot
Straight Oscar Meyer bullshit. Biden is racist AF.
Trump campaign ad manipulates three images to put Biden in a ‘basement’  #Election2020 #disinformation
Right-wing media defanged by dissolving anti-Biden storylines  The three biggest anti-Joe Biden storylines in right-wing media over the last year have fizzled: Biden’s mental fitness; Hunter Biden; and Tara Reade. They peaked in April/May...  #Election2020
If you support Biden you support pedos
This is one of the most optimistic things I've read in days! I hope Biden sees it! #climatesolutions
More of those peaceful protesters Obama talked about at the Biden Campaign funeral?
Young voters - you might not be excited by Biden. I get it. But the other option is the party that thinks you are SO STUPID you’ll vote for their distraction candidate Kanye West and feel like you made a difference. I know you’re smarter than that.
Biden won’t have any trouble with that. One shove and Donnie will be on his back like a turtle.
Biden will crush Trump in debates.
Because your mother told you that 2 wrongs don't make a right. You don't cancel racism with more racism. Besides, if Biden really believed his own words, he would have done something about it during his decades in government.
Nobody that would ever vote Democrat cares about Benghazi.   Kamala’s most memorable debate moment was when she called Joe Biden a racist. Her 2nd most memorable debate moment was when Tulsi Gabbard torched her record
“Ivanka’s $4 million haul tops the $1.7 million that Warren raised for Biden last Friday. But, in June, Warren brought in $6 million for Biden in his largest single-event to date.”  Ivanka’s $4m haul is larger than Kamala’s largest Biden fundraiser😞
Instant coffee.🙁I quit drinking "for the duration" when this mess started not realizing it was going to go on, and on. My birthday is coming up - here tell it's on the same day Biden is due to accept the nomination - and I plan to get righteously shitfaced.
If we are on the same team.. what do you want I hate Trump and everything he stands for and I fully support Biden so if you don’t support him you can leave anytime
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.
He sounds like a joe Biden with dementia,  wait
Noooo... Biden and Trump are propaganda puppets put in office to keep you from thinking about things like cancer clusters and who we gave 27 TRILLION dollars to.
So true! Biden is indeed a racist person. That is all he sees. Trump sees all of us as what our character is. Trump sees no skin color. #ColdWarRadio
Sorry to hear you will be sitting this one out. Hopefully you will reconsider if Biden's VP pick is someone you would like to see in the White House. Unfortunately progress is slow when it comes to equality and justice and while we could have done better than Joe he isn't bad.
Actually made me mad. The smirk on Biden's face and him almost flexing on you or something I didn't like that at all.
Yup. Biden will ruin this or ignore it.  um ur um where was I?
You all remember how Obama botched debate #2 in 2012, causing polls to flip, and Biden utterly obliterated Ryan soon after and singlehandedly flipped them back?
joe biden will win if he cosplays as SMT V protag
So can Biden hire, per say, Eminem to run for President to steal votes away from Trump? Asking for someone who isn’t orange.
Please do research on Biden you’d be surprised
then why wontthey run a liberal? biden literally called desegregation a racial jungle If thats not hard right, what is?
Biden is brainless now!! He should be the Poster Boy for Dementia!!!
Biden just said WHAT?!  via
As far as I know, Biden hasn’t grabbed any women by the pussy, isn’t hanging out with pedophiles, hasn’t called Latinos rapists or African Americans thugs, hasn’t fucked a porn star; can hold a bible correctly, drinks water with one hand, and is the better candidate for office.
Joe Biden is a racist.

Joe Biden is a racist.
I’m voting for Biden but I won’t donate to his campaign if he picks Harris to be his VP.  It would feel like a middle finger directed at Warren supporters who advocated for the half a dozen policies Harris doesn’t support.  Also, she’s a poor debater

If Joe Biden didn’t believe Kamala Harris was an easy target to go after from the Left or the Right, he would have announced her as his VP weeks ago.   The longer he waits=more doubts he’s having
Since when do you have access to Joe Biden?
I support bringing new people in. I would support you, if only you didn't support Trump. Biden is not who I wanted to run, but i will take him over Trump any century any day. Please reconsider, and good luck to you. I hope you get elected and make a difference
Your show is so bad. Trump sucks. Live with it. Biden 2020!!!
Biden just made a gaffe. Yes it was. But nothing compared to raging racist Donald Trump. Biden has my vote.
Trump and cronies have a hidden agenda. He is a Vatican proxy and is struggling to keep the world distracted from me. They fear me and refuse to mention me directly, and instead use proxies like Obama, Biden, etc. to keep the nation duped and distracted.
I really don’t think so, joe Biden gonna go back into hiding and trump gonna keep talking and making it worse
Yes. We would all like Joe Biden better.
You ain't black if you vote for Joe Biden
Biden's ineptness one of many reasons Trump may still be in the White House Jan. 21.
Michelle Obama might actually win imo. If Biden and Trump debate, it's over for Joe.
Probably.. Biden is at least twice as bad however.
Joe Biden.. a catholic.. will hurt God.. goddamn.
I've never seen a biden sign
Why We’re Demanding No Cops for Veep  “If Joe Biden wants to signal his commitment to the message of the Black Lives Matter movement, he shouldn’t pick a former police officer or prosecutor.” Agreed.
You need to vote for Biden no matter what
You seem to have Biden confused with Donny's golden toilet
Republican threatens to not vote for Biden unless Kamala is the VP  Why does anyone care what these losers want?    ⬇️⬇️⬇️
Biden could pick a literal dumpster fire as his V.P. and I’d still vote for him. It’s time for 45 to go.
If Biden becomes President, there'll be no HEAVEN. No HELL below us! Above us only SKY! If Biden is elected there will be no more COUNTRIES. Nothing to KILL or DIE for! And no religion too! IMAGINE IT!
I mean, Biden isn’t a gem either, but Trump has got to go, byeeeeee.
With respect, this sounds like 'I want to vote for Biden but if everything doesn't meet my specific preferences I'm willing to bail on the greater good'.
.   When you said departing the oval office I got all excited for a moment. I thought you finally figured out you'd save face by resigning instead of losing to Biden.
Taken out of context in the article which says “Biden attempted to explain that point by arguing that Latinos in Florida and Arizona had different views on immigration.” And that’s completely true. Same way East Coast and West Coast have turnpikes vs. freeways so shut up Trump.
People don't vote for VP. Seriously, they don't. If Biden's VP choice turns you off voting, you're not a serious person, no matter what your age.
rethinking my anti-Biden stance now
New polls show that Trump is narrowing the Gap with Biden. What in the hell is wrong with America that they would vote for that fool!
Let me guess, that help has to be for the Biden campaign, right?
Who let Joe Biden out of the basement and onto the airwaves unattended again?!
KHive threatening to go after Biden
“Harris memorably put her hand up when a debate moderator asked who on stage supported eliminating private insurance, which Sanders does. She later backtracked, stating to donors that she was not comfortable with parts of his plan,”  untrustworthy
if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
The 1st requirement for VP is a trust relationship w/ the President.  That doesn’t exist w/ her.  Her attack against Biden in the 1st debate proved that Harris is willing to attack other Dems. With her as VP, Biden would need someone to check his dinner for poison every evening.
Some people already know who they’re voting for and who they will NOT be voting for... and it’s not YOU. So we will get our Biden votes in early so you can start shitting your presidential pants early and make the next three months hell for you. That’s the LEAST we can do.
Maybe Mrs Obama _is_ pining for the Demos' nomination (as Mr Biden's 'issues' become too great for him to remain the candidate). Had always thought the idle spec about her and the presidency was just that.
I can't believe that someone is so stupid, but then again he said we should inject disinfectant into ourselves. He's trying to kill enough to make sure he wins in November, but if I have to walk 100 miles, I'm voting for Biden. #TrumpisaMurderer
Kamala Harris supporters:   “We will attack Joe Biden’s character if he doesn’t make Kamala Harris his VP”
Good. More reason to vote for Biden and the Democrats.
This is a weird strategy, all Biden has to do is show up and not completely shit the bed, and he beats the expectations they've set.

Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
You’re right. My premise a year ago was that Biden would choose Michelle but now as his mental accument is being challenged, she just may step ahead of him and with Barry’s endorsement she’ll probably make it. But with the Obama’s Gaffes the past 10 1/2 years, their done.
Imagine if someone could harness the energy of Repugs shifting after the election from their laissez faire attitude toward Donald to their hyper critical demands of President Biden.  Wouldn’t that be awesome?
Lots of people are pretty pissed about the Super Tuesday Surprise, the Biden campaign’s refusal to countenance popular left policies (legalize weed, defund cops, M4A) and the party’s embrace of Republicans. There’s not as much daylight between Biden and Trump as there should be.
lol what’s Biden supposed to answer
Biden strikes me as a full-back kinda guy, who just calls him "my lad."  So I'm going with either a fullback dive or an angle route.

#GOPComplicitTraitors Fact check: Trump makes at least 20 false claims in Fox &amp; Friends interview
I think of this picture every time hear Biden anything
Without Trump &amp; the Republicans, there’s no substantive reason to like Joe Biden. He only looks appealing relative to ghoulish republicans. Compared to a progressive Democrat, Biden seems antiquated.   Sincerely, A young person
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot my message.
You can not ignore that biden has mental issues. You can not ignore that he grooms young women and pets them and sniffs hair. Dude is wierd. Trump is trying to help people by bringing hcq treatment to light. You are right, trump and biden are not on equal footing. Biden sucks.
If Biden actually debates, then Trump will win. No doubt. Y'all better figure out how to prevent that from happening.
Joe Biden for all Americans. Not just Republicans n top 1%. It's possible with Biden
If Biden gets elected will we start offering gibberish as a language option in high school?
Have you ever listen to your dad? YIKES WTF 😡is the kindest we can say when trump opens his mouth to talk about any and all subjects.  I know you’ll say anything to be accepted by him.  Good luck Donnie VOTE BLUE VOTE BIDEN
When will Hallmark start a line of "Thank you for being a patriot" cards? I'm ready to send one to:  Sally Yates Lt. Col. Vindman Anthony Fauci Reality Winner Joe Biden Eric Swalwell Meidias Touch Randy Rainbow Sarah Cooper  Who else?
This is the type of hubris WE DO NOT NEED MORE OF. If it weren't an issue, take the test, hell, take FIVE TESTS, and put the issue to rest. American politicians, now having learned from the Trump playbook, will instead scoff at those seeking answers.
I have followed the belief that Michelle would run, even though she realized her husband would actually run the show. I was ignored but after looking at that publication it was obvious a real pro put it together. Biden, if he wins will resign shortly on medical necessity. Bet?
I received a tweet from Michelle Obama asking my support for her as VP for Biden. Glossy professionally done template obviously prepared and sent to ALL registered voters. I sent a snarly, yet polite ABSOLUTELY NOT! Reply to the sender, Twitter did not process it.
Biden is Not Mentally Capable of making the Speech, anymore than He is Mentally Capable (Not), of debating President Trump!!! Biden's Mind Is Gone!!!

We are over six months into this thing and we still don't have same day result testing for the masses or a vaccine. We are 4% of the worlds population and yet we represent over 20% of the worlds covid 19 deaths. We need better leadership. Vote Biden, pronounced Bye Don
It was a test for cognitive impairment. Please report accurately. Biden not taking said test demonstrates no one is concerned he is suffering from dementia, unlike trump’s doctors.
Same. Biden should use it for his campaign ad.
Reminder:  Warren is the only person on Biden’s VP shortlist who has experience dealing with a national economic crisis
Thank you VP Biden!  Please also keep in mind that our system (or lack of crucial laws within our system) has given rise to the tyranny of this president. Laws must be enacted to safeguard against what we have seen from both the White House and Congress from ever happening again.
Wonder if Joe Biden understands what a fool he’s making of himself? Wonder how he feels about he’s going to replace Jimmy Carter as the biggest political buffoon in America’s history?
lol you think never-trump republicans are worth attracting to the Dem party ffs.   Also most people DID want universal healthcare but many voted for Biden instead because they were sold on the false idea that he was more electable.
You aren't being fair to Biden. He gets the white cheddar goldfish too. 😁
ffs we don't want trump, which is why we're trying to push Biden to improve his policies because we don't think he can win unless he endorses policies like Medicare For All.

Biden ran for President twice before being the VP pick in 2008, would have ran for President in 2016 but was too distraught, and did run in 2020 but folks who have presidential ambitions shouldn’t be VP picks. Oh, I get it. He falls under the white, male exemption clause.
Yes, Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation with senate Republicans that condemned the Obama-Biden administration 𝙗𝙮 𝙣𝙖𝙢𝙚.
I really hope you take time to listen to both candidates. If having a brain is a concern than you might not be voting for anyone. Biden is worse. He is losing his mind.
KHive stop attacking the other women on Biden’s VP list challenge
How?! Are you both Republicans and one just doesn’t like Trump? Or is the Biden supporter actually a Democrat? This election is a matter of basic morality to me, and I couldn’t marry someone who doesn’t share certain fundamental moral tenets with me.
We also no Biden has Dementia, so there's that.
Did Biden pick a vp?
This why centrists support Kamala Harris: she is an empty suit. She won’t push Biden on any issue. None
Uh no, if we’re talking about willingness to push Biden left on issues they are not equal. Harris has never pushed him on any issue. None.
I’m trying to save lives! I lost my grandparents who were both in their early 60s with no preexisting health conditions. I’ve lost enough family members to know that this virus is extremely dangerous. Biden said it best #StayHomeSaveLives
so will he drop the "biden has dementia" strategy now?
Kamala Harris has not pushed Biden left on a single issue. None.
Nope, Biden pushed Harris to the right. Her actual position on busing was the exact same one Biden holds. That didn’t come out until people asked her straight up if she supports it or not
The reason people want Warren to be Biden’s VP is because she is the least likely to become a “Yes” woman. She will shake the table and push Biden further left   Kamala Harris hasn’t pushed Biden on a single issue. None. Technically he pushed her towards the right on busing 🤡
I haven't forgotten that Trump failed to show up for at least one of the debates before the last election...i'd really like to see Biden cut Trump to shreds
Just to be clear, I DO hope Biden wins and I'm 99.99% certain he can win without my vote (apparently the DNC agrees). I also hope people won't let up one bit on the protests until real changes are achieved.  I think Joe might be a worse hawk on Syria and Iran, but... RBG.
How ever anyone interprets it, there is one paradigm that no one can successfully argue against. The program ideas of Bernie Sanders have a far better chance of getting implemented through Biden than Trump. I've worked my whole life for those ideals. I want more success b4 i go.
If playing a defensive posture means people are in the streets, I don't want that to end just because people feel vaguely better about who's in charge. I want it to continue until we actually win. I worry about false complacency under Biden. Obama ended the anti-war protests.
Biden won't standcup to Any Country, Any Corruption, For Any American, in Any Way!!! Vote Trump 2020!!!
it's so good that this is our president. and also that joe biden is basically just as cogent.
AOC is right. Biden should choose a VP who excites young voters. There’s only a handful of people on his list that do that
To the best of my knowledge, Biden is zero for 24 on the progressive policies that matter most. Most of these positions are supported by a majority of Americans overall and supermajorities of Democrats. I'm not asking for perfection, just SOMETHING.
Crazy how if you say Biden is a delusional pedophile you get slammed with “oh okay coming from a trump supporter.” Bitch no. I don’t support him either. Biden still a pedo bro😂😂
I'll give you 10 reasons to vote for joe biden and I've been and will always support Bernie. 1. Joe has integrity and is not trump 2. Joe has empathy &amp; is not trump 3. Joe has good sense &amp; is not trump 4. Joe will listen to experts &amp; is not trump 5. Joe is a strong leader..

Joe Biden (according to tRump) •Against God •Against Bible •Against the Burbs 😂😂😂😂😂
Not to put a damper on this, because I'm also counting the days, but the reality is - assuming he's elected - he won't be President Biden until January when he takes his oath. That leaves a lot of time for 45 to continue doing damage - and he's going to make the most of it.
Who said I support Biden?
I wouldnt trust anyone who doesnt know that using the word 'blacks' to refer to black people is not liberal. and democrats clearly cant be trusted because they think people like sanders and biden are liberal. so the party wont allow a liberal even after all weve done for them.
the game was 30 years ago chip. now progress isnt oinb the table. We just lost 50 years of progress and biden isnt going to get it back. even if he was a liberal, the courts wont allow it now
its really seems to me like its the same old dualistic thinking that says helpingour enemies is somehow good for us. biden wont end the war against liberalism, Obama didnt. Maybe covid can
Biden is changing his mind, if thats possible? No debate? Trump will be smart holding a debate with or without him. Like that comedian from years ago who talked on the phone without a word from his chattee, just corny one sided dialogue, perfect ‘straight man’ role for Joe.

A little tired of everyone telling me how I should feel about Biden and his VP choices. Let me have my own thoughts, for the love of god.
I know it’s been a lousy 3 1/2 years Mr. President but thank God for Joe Biden.
Biotin is not capable of doing any attacks on Trump. His people can tell him what to do and say, but biting himself cannot attack Trump. Not possible. Trump will walk all over Biden. All of Biden's policies are disastrous. Trump's policies actually work to build up the USA.
Oh, but you err! This is NOT 2016, regardless of your poll lies: we KNOW who we are voting for in 2020: Biden. Be prepared.
"Don't be afraid to be boring"  Lolz, it's like team Biden is trying to lose
Trump is an inspirational figure -- he either inspires great loyalty or great rage. He has upset a lot of apple carts in the GOP, and so a subset of conservatives want him gone BAMN, even if it means electing Biden. They want a complete restoration of the GOP BT (before Trump).
I hope and pray he is defeated, I can not vote for Biden but I will vote for anybody but trump,
I think we see the lack of experience in politics. This is as bad as the way Trump Republicans go about things. Diplomacy, negotiation, esprit de corps. Build a bigger coalition. A much better way to move your policy agenda. It is what Biden does.
I’m voting for Biden no matter what, and honestly, he was one of my last picks. But here’s our real job this year... FLIP THE MF SENATE!
Give me one example of a Joe Biden sign of demensia and I'll give you five Tump examples. Do you even have any? What, did he say million when he meant hundred thousand, is that it? Drink some coffefe and think about it.

I don’t think he could if Biden waited. Once the RNC is on the books I believe Pence is locked in
Biden could easily mandate masks and impose steep fines for disobeying the law. Like other countries do. Americans wore seatbelts when required to, they would wear masks. Stop with the thinking errors you look stupid.
When there was an Ebola threat they helped New Jersey even though it was run by GOP Governor. Trump decided not to help cuz the initial outbreak was in DEM states. Thousands died. Your being a stupid ass. Biden sucks but he doesn’t kill Americans cuz they may vote against him.
Put it this way. Trump is cutting taxes and “Joe Biden actually wants to raise taxes over $7 trillion on the American people.”—
Ukraine did show quid pro quo. See Boltons book or at least summaries. Senate GOP would not call him as witness otherwise the conviction would be eminent. On live tv he asked china to help him by investigating biden. 2A. Illegal activity/obstruction. Too many firings of...

If Biden has dementia, Donnie boy has Alzheimer’s.
A small part of me wants him to win reelection ONLY so that he is in office to see his propped up economy crumble around him. My fear is Biden winning and being blamed for not being able to stop it. Trump needs to reap what he's sown.
Why shouldn’t Biden’s running mate have an ambition to be president some day? Most historically have, haven’t they? The implication here is infuriating if true.
nazi times doesnt know anything about any joe biden. god you must think we are stiupid
When you see the  campaign taking massive television ads against Biden, forget what he says (which is false), YOU KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING DOWN, BIG. Trump winning means WE will pay the ultimate price of any nation in the world as we are right now. Watch!!!
Really? Did you type that with a straight face? I will give you five examples of word stumbles of Trump's for every one that you give me of Biden's. Go ahead, I'm waiting.
Yes and their goal, if Biden wins, is to welcome back all the illegal aliens tha were deported! Tijuana here we come!
That's hilarious. Are you really that delusional to think that Biden how's the chance in any debate with Trump? Trump will walk all over him so easily. Your TDS is really bad. You should talk to a doctor about that.
Your question plants the suggestion in the readers mind that if Biden doesn't debate Trump, that somehow might make Biden unworthy of people's vote. Why would you want people to even consider thinking that way when you yourself are blue to the core
I don’t think anyone is suggesting they won’t vote for Biden. People are warning against picking a bad VP choice for who will be a distraction for the next 4 years
I’m really tired of people pretending Kamala Harris is a great debater.   She isn’t.   Her most memorable debate performances:  1. When she implied Joe Biden was a segregation supporting racist   and  2. When goofy Tulsi Gabbard torched her record and left her speechless
You know how great that comparison is from Joe Biden to Donald trump when the word “gun control” is misspelled
“Stacey Abrams orK Harris would add pizzazz”  Imagine reducing a female politician’s contribution to a ticket as simply being “pizzazz”.  Rubin thinks Biden’s VP choice =window dressing
I wish Biden had never hinted he might not run for re-election in 2024.   Otherwise we wouldn’t have to worry about bombshell stories surrounding his potential VP running mate for the next 4 years
It's funny that people try to paint Biden as a pedo while supporting a "man" that has actually been accused of it and openly admitted to walking into an underage girls changing room because "he could" since it was his event. He tells you what he is. Listen to him.

Aha! Biden has moved back his announcement who his VP is going to be. Congress already knows. Barrack, after a long silence is offering plans for resurrection and ending filibusters, indicates his re-entry into the public arena... Why? Cause he’ll be the husband of the new VP...
Trump's muddled message isn't landing
Bad sign for Harris supporters:   She was an early favorite... so either Biden is having second thoughts or he thinks her record is controversial and doesn’t want the preceding weeks  before the DNC to be filled with stories about her past
If the Republicans only cared for the people of this country that would be really nice. They have proven over the last 4years they don’t give a fig for this country or our democracy.  Vote for Biden, he cares.

Elizabeth Warren can raise more money *and* she can get 10x as many small dollar donations   Her supporters will follow her wherever she goes  If Biden is smart, he’ll ask her to be on the ticket ....because if she’s not, then our donations will go 💸
Why isn’t Biden doing fundraisers with Kamala? Because she doesn’t have much influence and her supporters aren’t enthusiastic enough to donate 🙂
Elizabeth Warren’s supporters like me *actually* donate to campaigns we support ...and if Biden doesn’t select Warren to be his VP running mate then my $$$ will only go to Warren Dems because my money only goes to politicians who support a wealth tax 🙂
“if he does not choose Kamala Harris as his VP, all I will do is vote... no more campaign donations”  Considering they didn’t even donate to Kamala Harris’s primary campaign, im sure Biden’s team isn’t very worried about these ultimatums😭😭😭😭

It’s hilarious that you 2 don’t see that Biden will lie or bend the truth just as much as Trump in a debate.
3rd party options: 1) Vote for Trump: Trump wins 2) Vote for Biden: Biden wins 3) Vote 3rd party candidate:  Polls show Biden losing more votes than Trump so Trump wins  If you're fine with four more years of Trump then vote 3rd party, if not vote Biden.  It's not brain surgery.
People are missing the point.  1) Vote for Trump - Trump wins 2) Vote for Biden - Biden wins 3) Vote 3rd party - pulling more votes Biden then Trump (as in 2016), and Trump wins  If you're fine with a Trump victory then vote 3rd party, if not vote Biden.  It's not brain surgery.
If Biden can tell me who, specifically, is going to forcibly remove Trump from office when he refuses to leave I'll vote for him. Otherwise wtf is the point? Everyone with the power to forcibly remove Trump are also capable of being fired by Trump. He's not going anywhere.
You're either missing the point or, well, I don't know what. I've voted third party myself when I felt that ultimately there wasn't any difference between the D &amp; R candidates, which is often the case. But there's a HUGE difference between Trump &amp; Biden. We HAVE to defeat Trump.
Waiting for Biden to announce his VP
Kamala Harris supporters: “I will not vote for Joe Biden”  YIKES
Harris allies granted call with Biden campaign after Dodd blowup
If Joe Biden is going to listen to someone about this choice it is Obama. Unlike Ed Rendell or Chris Dodd, Obama has made this decision before. Biden isn't going to listen to a backbencher.
Biden's too dumb to not blow cover.
will biden end thewar against hillary? Will biden hold the fbi accountable to the law?  long as this nazi country wages war against liberaliusm trump and biden are the same to decent peoiple. both hate liberls so liberals wouuld be stuopid to vote for eithe
Shields and Brooks on Biden’s VP decision, pandemic economy | PBS NewsHour  “...if I'm sticking to my ‘governance’ matters more than ‘politics’, Elizabeth Warren be a good choice.”
Joe Biden should cancel the debates with Trump and debate Sarah Cooper instead, Cooper as Trump is a lot smarter anyway

How Biden's VP pick could tip the scales in Wisconsin  “[Elizabeth Warren] represents one of the best opportunities to win voters who had supported Bernie Sanders over Biden in the primary election.” Agreed 100%
You seem to be confusing Biden with trump
If Joe Biden makes a campaign promise to un-ban Tik Tok we will see the biggest youth turnout in the history of America lol
Kamala Harris co-sponsored legislation with Republican senators to condemn the Obama-BIDEN admin because they criticized illegal Israeli settlements
No, we don't love you at all.  We WISH Biden was a lefty, he's a moderate republican and you know it 😂  #NeverBidenNeverTrump #FDT
Or you could say, "many are uniting behind Biden regardless of his VP pick. The online noise grows irksome."
Hm let’s see Biden could ask Warren to be his VP and he’ll get:  - a massive grassroots network of donors / supporters  or he could ask Harris and get:  - a massive twitter troll army that didn’t donate anything to her campaign and probably won’t donate to his either way
The largest fundraiser that Kamala  Harris hosted with Joe Biden had 1,400 donors...
Should I assume that you are voting for Biden? So who's stupid here?
me, 2 days ago:  this “she’s just too ambitious!” story feels like a cover for something the Biden campaign doesn’t want to discuss publicly about Kamala Harris’s record  twitter / khive: you’re paranoid  me, today:
This is ****way***** larger than the event Kamala Harris did last month. She managed to attract 1,400 attendees for her fundraiser with Biden  Warren brought 40,000.
Harris also campaigned against the USMCA which Biden supported
Biden’s internal polling
She hasn’t. Warren has lead almost every single poll. Harris has lead 1 of them or been tied   Biden’s internal polling shows Harris isn’t popular amongst Black voters, according to The NY Times
Biden’s team is doing internal polling, if Harris isn’t chosen it’s because she doesn’t poll well amongst voters Biden wants support from
People who don’t support Kamala Harris for the VP position  -her former aides  -young voters  -Biden’s VP search team  -progressive voters  -Biden’s aides  -people who endorsed Harris during the primary  -the Left  -california dems  -black voters in the midwest
Jennifer Rubin: “If Biden doesn’t pick Kamala Harris then he is a misogynist”  Are you a REPUBLICAN?
There might be a contested nomination no matter what, assuming biden doesnt run. The Dem party is restive and has a lot of talented people who want to move up.
Biden needs to either eliminate it or do some drastic restructuring. This is what some feared would/could happen when creating DHS.
Kamala Harris is only popular on twitter. She isn’t popular in real life.   Biden’s internal polling most likely supports this and the results of the Democratic primary clearly support this.
precisely. It's not like Joe Biden doesn't have name recognition.
Do you think Joe Biden doesn't have enough name recognition? One problem in the last election was that Hillary had too much name recognition. Kamala has Considerable name recognition. Just like Susan Rice. OTOH you make a good point.👀
This is a poor metric to use.   Warren did the best out of everyone on Biden’s VP shortlist in the primary.   She did better than Kamala Harris who was so unpopular in her own home state that she polled in 5th place (tied w/ Gabbard) and had to drop out to avoid being embarrassed
“the Biden campaign should be concerned about things like the secret $400,000 settlement Harris’ office paid to settle “gender harassment” claims against a top aide named Larry Wallace.”  This is really bad, Maya
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders
Think Biden is waiting to long he needs to make his VP pick like yesterday any one of them is great He needs to put his cabinet together soon too cuz he will need to hit the ground running  It will take him at least a year to clean up Trump mess
If Biden picks Kamala, TRUMP WINS  via
“Polling has indicated Kamala doesn't help much w black voters”  Biden’s internal polling must show really bad numbers for Kamala Harris
Or Biden's AG!!
Joe Biden should pick Karen Bass, not Kamala Harris, as VP | The Sacramento Bee  “The Biden campaign should be concerned about things like the secret $400,000 settlement Harris’ office paid to settle gender harassment claims against a top aide...”
“Biden should be concerned about gender harassment claims against a former Harris aide, Larry Wallace, that her office settled for $400,000 while denying wrongdoing. Harris has said she was unaware of the allegations against Wallace.”
The case for Warren begins with the most important criterion: she'd be ready to be president on day one, according to former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank.

Wait...you feel Good about Biden???🤔  wtf....Biden can't remember who his wife is or where he is.... How can you feel good about Biden????
hell, keep him in there. electrify all the fences, make it "trump penitentiary" (even put the name on a billboard on  top of the house). Prosecute &amp; convict his minions, drop them inside the grounds to join him. Life imprisonment. We'll build another place for Biden.
“California Democrats, including several in Congress, have expressed their wariness about [Kamala] Harris to Mr. Biden’s advisers.”
“More telling, a Biden campaign official reached out to The New York Times, unprompted, to say that some of the former vice president’s own staff members are not supportive of her.”  And apparently Biden’s team doesn’t like her either. Good. Harris has a terrible record.
“One Democrat close to Mr. Biden’s campaign said its polling indicated [Kamlaa] Harris has little allure with Black voters.”  attn KHive:   Read the room. Democrats don’t want her to the VP. Get over your hurt feelings
Sure, Joe Biden may have a reprehensible voting record, but did you know that he also lacks any sort of charisma
Double Marxist? I wish Biden was 1/4 that cool
Trump campaign cancels TV ads to try to figure out how to stop losing to Biden  Trump's campaign is removing its current television ads from the airwaves and reviewing its messaging strategy, hitting a full-scale reset button.  #Election2020
Yes I agree and apparently his wife is making a legitimate run for his former leadership position. Surprised she’s not convincing Biden o add her to his VP list.
Hah! The nausea inducing Olsen accused Biden of conspiracy mongering when in April he suggested trump would do this. Today Olsen is just surfacing from the bottom if his slime pit...

more evidence against you than you ever had against clinton and biden. Everybody Knows That.
I'm sure Biden is waiting with baited breath to hear from Rove
Don’t worry Joe I’ve been supporting you since you ran for president in 1988 #Biden #BidenHarris2020So Biden is a robot the Russians are remotely controlling?  Brook, that would really explain a lot!
How do we handle this? If he is coming out and saying he's only doing it to "steal" votes away from Biden how does America not come out fully equipped to punish him? This can't be legal.
Lots of people are talking about how Trump is bad and very few people are being honest about Biden. There are simply more lies to push back on, and more of those lies are coming from sources that need the pushback.
Pssst...I’m not a Biden guy either. Both idiots. No matter who is the “culprit” (like this is some fun caper to be solved?), Trump bungled and didn’t take it seriously. Even he came around on masks (finally). Take it serious at first and jobs would have never gotten to this point
In a socialist country people are easier to control and it ties in with covid19 Bill Gates anthony fauci child trafficking epstein Hollywood pedos nancy pelosi khamila harris joe biden most of the music industry and a few people in professional sports.
Trump and Biden are every reason we need a viable 3rd party.
2/2  The only person to blame if Biden doesn't beat the #OrangeTroll in November will be Biden. It's his job to make people want to vote for him.  Online trolls bullying people won't change minds.
1/2  1. There is a lot less difference between Biden and Trump then people want to admit, and I think a lot of people are in denial about it.  2. She lives in a safe blue state, so it's irrelevant.  3. It only does harm if Biden and other Dems don't listen.
the ODNI has publicly stated today that Russia is actively working on a disinformation campaign against Joe Biden, and a campaign in support of Trump. As a US senator, why are you collaborating with Russia on THEIR campaign.
I agree I would love to see a Biden-Warren ticket!
US intelligence says Russia is using a range of measures to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. -
Running interference for Biden. Shame.
Saying That Joe Biden Is Against God Is Not Only Not True But Is Blasphemous!!!! Donald Trump Holding The Bible Upside Down For A Photo Op Is Sacrilegious?? I Would Bet $1,000.00 That Trump Has Never Read A Single Passage Of Scripture In His Life??? So The Religious Right What??!

- It’s Ana - It’s Team Biden
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
I seriously ... what we got vs. what Biden might be ... hell, who's his running mate?  They'll be president not long after Biden takes over if he gets it.
Stephen Miller’s plan was to separate children from parents and have white parents adopt and raise them. It’s chilling and more chilling that we ignore it as a country. Biden has much to reverse once in office
Good morning! I’m still not voting for biden, fuck the Portland police, now it’s time for coffee✌️
We will have 166 days of very heightened vigilance after Biden wins. That will be the most dangerous 166 days in our history
Kamala's job if selected as Biden's running mate will be to articulate Biden's platform.
I care desperately for people to quit allowing neolibs to define the choices for you. It is not Trump or Biden unless you fall for that.
Biden loves him
Obama an biden both called this dem senator a hero for his believers. Odd word choice for a kkk recruiter.
Biden hates black people. He’s an old school white supremacist.
According to the centrists “It’s just the way Biden talks and Joe being Joe Biden”🙄.  Sound familiar?🤨. I’m voting for the lame moron but Warren and Sanders would’ve been much better presidents if elected.  Can’t wait for 2024 Democratic primary!
Trump. I know. But it’s the lesser of two evils. And Biden is BAD
Biden needs to pick a VP soon to handle diversity stuff before his verbal shitposting catches up to him. I mean Trump has lowered the bar low, but there's a limit for independent voters.
And Trump is "pro-life" just because he *says* he opposes it?!? 😅 Look at his UN-Prolife behavior in other ways! BTW, Biden said previously that he is opposed to abortion, but that he cannot &amp; should not force his beliefs on others. That's democracy whether ppl like it or not.
Why is he so uniquely special? He’s doing everything that the Republican Party, with Biden’s help, has been working on since the 1970s.  Biden has supported and cooperated with that agenda. Why is he better?  If you say “Trump” in your answer, you lose. Biden kills my wife too.
Trump has done more for black people since 2016 than Biden has ever done. Biden has always been a true white supremacist
Media needs you to think Biden is inevitable, landslide Joe.
- OMG the grandparent #Biden ad is ME...I am missing my grandchildren more than ANYTHING...and missing so much of their growth and development. I am freakin BITTER about the botched #COVID19 response. And #Iblametrump
He blocked me for telling him why his entire theory of supporting Biden to push him left was crap.
#BidenIsRacist #Biden said racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."  He prevented thousands of children from receiving better educations and more opportunities in life #WhiteSupremacist
Biden is an old school true white supremacist and racist
Biden was against school integration and said that racial integration policies would cause his children to "grow up in a racial jungle."
Tough on real crimes. Biden crime bill locked up people for life and ruined lives with no hope of getting rehabilitation. It caused MASS INCARCERATION. It most especially hurt black and brown people. It’s disgusting that he can deny it now.
I greatly respect  and I have a lot of respect for what he is doing, but the words "binary choice" are just wrong. There are at least three candidates for President better than both Trump and Biden.  #NeverTrump #NeverBiden
please NO #SUSANRICE. The potential president after Joe Biden ISNT Susan Rice. Karen Bass is. She and  have plans to restore our nation. They’ve both proven they’ve delivered &amp; will continue
What if both Trump and Biden get covid and Kanye is the last candidate standing?
I don't think Biden should debate Trump. Why? Because you cannot carry on a real debate with someone who has NO regard for truth or anything fact-based. He's a lying asshole &amp; of less value than a penny postage stamp.
Not Republicans but Trump's lawyers!  He is trying to divide the votes to keep Biden from a victory.
WaPo desperate to get Biden elected, Obama’s third term.
So you’re saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven’t been able to do? Sounds like he’d be a powerful leader then.
The whole spectacle of Biden is an embarrassment to the United States. Less so than Trump, who is daily actively destroying our government and our assets. But we need someone who will rebuild knowledge and capability instead of destruction.
Censorship is the prime tool to elect Biden, Obama’s third term
Had a dream Michelle Obama surprised everyone and ran w Biden. Far out shit man. Time to log out.
Trump campaign ad features doctored images of Joe Biden 'in his basement, alone'  via
Why introduce a straw man?  We're talking about demanding more from Biden, not the #OrangeTroll.
Twitter is big part of Joe Biden campaign to eliminate and censor any views they don’t approve of. Obama wants third term.
This could peel away Republican voters that were considering Biden. Timing on this was bad.
This is really concerning. The strategy is to pull off one to 2% of the black vote in swing States like Wisconsin and Ohio away from Biden. Is there anything happening within the black community itself to counteract this measure?
Sundown Syndrome, you mean?  We call it "Alzheimer's Disease" now but it's still very real.  A friend who was an elderly care nurse says #JimCrowJoe has all the symptoms.  Why is Biden saying the Black community is monolithic?
The timing on this is terrible! Republicans that were considering voting for Biden will now peel off. Why are Dems so willing to shoot themselves in the foot in an election cycle.
What do you feel Biden will do about the issues #BlackLivesMatter is fighting for? Do you believe Black lives matter to Biden?
He is pending on the ballot in Wisconsin. They want to pull students away from voting for Biden.
Bernie Sanders was never pro-segregation. He was actively against it and was arrested protesting housing discrimination in Chicago. Desegregating housing would have also solved school segregation.  Equating Bernie and Biden on race is really dishonest.
She's saying Biden is a white supremacist who favors locking up all the Black men because he thinks they're junkies.  Better?
Comparing Warren and Biden to Bernie Sanders on race is insulting and either intellectually dishonest or very uneducated on actual policy.  Warren and Biden are white supremacists.
WATCH: Biden Says He Wouldn't Stand In The Way Of A Trump Prosecution
Why? Why would they now be coming out of woodwork but before there was no suits whatsoever? Because this is what the GOP does, they find people from Biden’s past willing to take money to make an accusation. The GOP even for a woman to come out against Mueller and a guy against
Please, if there were any truth to these allegations Biden would have been sued just like Trumpnwas dozens, of not hundreds of times civilly over these supposed assaults. People these days sue if they have a groeviemce of this nature but none and I mean none of these woman sues
I want to be clear about something: I will vote for Biden this fall. Is he my first choice? NO. Our primary hadn't happened before everyone else dropped out. He's our ONLY real choice. I'm not happy, it's not ideal. But until the left can be really united, this is our choice.
You’re kidding yourself if you don’t think the crime bill hurt blacks much more than whites and target blacks. Watch how Biden speaks and what a disgusting pig he is the way he speaks of black children!
That’s an area of vast difference between progressives and Biden and Bernie. They both want to give the cops more money. They’re wrong.  The cops have too much money.
Two weeks ago, Joe Biden was being kept safely tucked away. He recently went on tv again.  What do you think?
What could possibly go wrong for Biden now?
Biden’s plan is more ACA subsidies to predatory insurance companies and lowering the Medicare age to 60. More Medicaid expansion.  You’re confusing Biden with Bernie.
Is Biden going to debate Trump??
Biden needs to debate Trump, which they will never let him, because it’s going to be a huge train wreck. #BidenHasDementia
Trump lowered the price of insulin and Biden is against #MedicareForAll, so I doubt he’s a one issue voter.
No one is speaking in Milwaukee. They chose to speak from their respective cities because of Covid. He’s not hiding in his basement. That pic that Trump touted is photoshopped.
Yeah I noticed that the last time I watched it. How disgusting! Biden is an awful person. Even with dementia, he can’t help himself from showing his true thoughts on black people.
I do cocaine to speed up his interviews to. Have you listened to joe Biden...have u listen to joe on cocaine an weeeed.
Sorry, but Biden is clearly anti FDR. This bullshit is offensive.
Has been changed and it’s been so many decades! Democrats like Biden did things like the Biden crime bill that sent soooo many black men to prison. The 3 strikes you’re out laws also!
I’ll be unpopular and point out the way Biden has dragged this out and waited has largely contributed to the internal strife about his pick is imo
Also is anyone really out there jumping up and down that Biden is Democrat nominee...   Good lord he can barely talk.
It is very clear that Biden is suffering mental decline.
Obama, Biden and Clinton’s.
Basement Biden will be in jail over Ukraine, and then there is lying and treason for spying.
Are her “dances” signals to Biden that it’s time to say something stupid and racist again?
Sure did Marsha the dude was  committing a crime. Why wouldn’t they order the AG to investigate. I don’t think Biden had the authority to order anything at that time now I think of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Alzheimer’s is a very specific type of dementia. Dementia is a brain disease. It’s not a mental illness. Unless Biden is diagnosed, it won’t be known what type of dementia he has specifically.
let’s face it. You have a distinct opportunity to affect billions of lives and direction of the population. Join Biden for election. Establish help to ease process burden. We need just, thoughtful sanity in US and beyond. Regards.
This is not sitting well we us Americans. It just another nail in his coffin as a President. Biden 2020
It’s we Americans thinks it’s time for you to leave. America we be great again when Biden wins
Also, the background was photo shopped on this photo. He isn't alone like it appears in the ad. We need to call this out. It won't stop. God only knows that they will photo shop Biden doing next.
I understand all of it except for the last part. “Push him around” is he talking about Biden, I’m assuming??
If he does, it’s not as advanced as Biden’s is. 🤷🏻‍♀️. Biden is really far gone at this point.
If having advanced dementia is cool, Biden is 💯
Biden has advanced staged dementia 🤦🏻‍♀️
You can’t possibly love this country if you’re voting for Biden in November. 🤷🏻‍♀️
💯!!!! Biden is the epitome of a shire supremacist
Joe Biden is a racist. He always has been. Look up the Biden crime bill. And, there are countless videos where you can see him saying the most racist things. He is a white supremacist.
Biden is going to actively break the left. If necessary, he'll purge the Dems the way Obama did. Dems lost 1K offices while Obama was President and it wasn't because they were "too ambitious."  He let people lose.
CNN is part of the Biden campaign for Obamas third term.
Who? I know that the Dems think it will get Biden voted into office, but it’s doing the opposite.
Biden won't go to Milwaukee to accept Democratic nomination
It's no different than Joe Biden giving paid speeches on behalf of Fred Upton when Upton was running for re-election. It's no different than Beto O'Rourke refusing to campaign against Will Hurd.  It's a big club and they're all in it. They're protecting the senior members.
I’m not okay with that. I switched parties 2 months ago, after I saw how insane and evil the Dems are. But, if I didn’t and was voting blue, I can’t imagine being okay with voting for dementia Biden and assuming who is running the show is someone I like.
Tucker Carlson says it's 'probably illegal' for Joe Biden to pick a Black woman as vice president
Wasn’t Biden friends with a KKK member or leader?
Ok. Trump has 25 allegations by women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has been recorded on Howard Stern and in other interviews making these misogynistic statements and those that sexualize his own daughter. You have videos of Biden hugging girls and kissing their heads.
I voted for Bernie in 2016 and would have in May if that was allowed in Oregon as an independent.  However as a Black male I can’t contemplate voting for IT and his White Supremacist agenda.  This time its Joe Biden or face the phase two of a 4th Reich.  It’s that serious.
"November 4th is too late. We should hold Joe Biden accountable now."  -    I really have to wonder why  is waiting for him to win. They should be at his door right now and demanding he sign on to Bernie's platform across the board.  Or no votes.
. source: Biden will not travel to Milwaukee to accept Democratic presidential nomination.
It appears that the Dems and MSM have infinite passes for Biden.
Truthfully I like she and Elizabeth Warren the best.  But Joe Biden won’t go wrong with any of the 8 women he is considering.  Gretchen Wilmer is also impressive.  I am Black but don’t believe he HAS to select a Black woman...selecting a woman who could run the country is #1!
Also Biden: C'mon man, are you a junkie?
Could he cede now so Biden can lead us out of a pandemic?
Me: Joe Biden is not the best the Democrats can do. Liberals: What do you mean? Me: Dementia, for one. Liberals: That's a Bernie Bro hoax!   Hold my beer.
If they take their month recess and leave us hanging out here NO ONE will vote Republican. They would return in Sept to all schools reopening or not, with no plan, no plan for funding us, no plan for testing, but lots of lies about how awful Biden would be for us.
And progressive #BLM activist  beat corrupt time server  There’s going to be real pressure on Biden from Congress!
The way I heard it, Reps are encouraging him because they believe that Black voters will defect to him from Biden.  So shortsighted and dumb.
I ran some polls about it, Twitter leftists like Teachout next best after  I will admit that, but I like  because I trust him to fight Biden because of his history of fighting Cuomo.  He was anti-Amazon before anyone.
It’s this simple:  is trying to preserve the GOP majority to give the Democratic Party a built in excuse for not passing progressive legislation if Biden wins.  #ChuckoTheClown needs a serious primary challenger from someone with legislative experience.
I agree with that one big question and I would add one other: who is best positioned to win in 2024?   Opinion | The one thing Joe Biden should think about in a running mate

"We have Trump in office because socialists want nice things and we mean liberals are willing to re-elect the #OrangeTroll to stop people from getting healthcare!"  Fixed it for you!  Now stop helping Trump win and start pushing Biden for #MedicareForAll!
I agree with   This is something for all my #Resistance followers to consider. Both Presidential candidates have largely the same view of the ongoing uprisings to #AbolishThePolice. So does Congress.  Who benefits from that? How many liberals will buck Biden?
He will, of course, be whining a different tune in November when he loses Frorida to Joe Biden. Then it will be back to "massive voter fraud from mail-in ballots, but absentee ballots were great!"
Got her spotted for Education Secretary. Working with Dr. Jill Biden with vital Education programs gutted by the Nazis, eliminating funding for Private Schools, appropriately
It really is. That was the kind of argument I could expect a real Biden supporter to make, and making it where it would be called out as wrong by  might actually be parody as praxis.
his mouth insanity falls out of it. #TrumpIsNotWell is an accurate and frightening reality. Biden is our choice. We might not like it, hell we might hate it, but voting 3rd party is NOT A CHOICE. #VoteBlueNoMatterWho #vote #AmericaWakeUp 3.
I hope this comment gets thrown at 45 when he refuses to go to Biden's inaugural. Of course, he would have fled the country by then, to a non extradition destination.
Outside of Twitter, most people haven’t even thought about the question of who will be Biden’s VP.
Biden loves children.
I’m waiting for the NYT to call off voting for President in 2020 and just appoint Biden President if all the editors there agree that’s what’s best for journalists, leeches, and grifters.
And then in 2024 we’ll be told “you Have to vote for Biden cause _____ is so bad. Change can come next time” then 2028 it’s “you have to vote for bland no change democrat because _______ is so evil. Change next time.”And on and on the cycle of corporate power continues.
I’m hoping for #BidenHarris2020.  In any case, #Biden has my vote. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare

Shucks, Joe Biden will be available after the first week of November
No, the movement took over the Republican Party and elected a "moderate Democrat" President in the guise of a conservative Republican and he turned out to be the fash.  Now the conservatives in both parties want to replace him with far right Joe Biden.
Exactly. After they realized the media wouldn't be able to look the other way if he won South Carolina, they fixed SC for Biden.
Biden still thinks he is VP
Let’s end them before Biden gets destroyed.
Panderingfor Hidin’ Biden, and the dementia parade.
It's true. A lot of white people just refuse to notice what's happening to people who aren't white and think other white people aren't poor.  That's the origin of the horrific "white working class" myth that sticks us with a choice between Biden and Trump.
LMAO, the Pizzagate, QAnon, Seth Rich, Hunter Biden, Obama is a secret Muslim crowd weighs in on conspiracies. 😂
I'd like to think so. But putting a former president in prison is something I don't see happening. The political fall out would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I want him in prison. But a Biden/Dem administration jailing him? Don't see it.
Tell Joe Biden: Make Abortion Access for All* A Top Priority
Really.....is that all you got??? TRUMP 2020!!!!
Yes, he had to compromise significantly with conservative Democrats he should have played hardball with. After he made his deal with the RW Dems he still didn't win any GOP votes.  Biden was telling him to deal with them. Yes, that's on him.
That doesn't really sufficiently address that ridiculous response though.   shouldn't Biden be able to show he cares more than the #OrangeTroll if he wants to be President?
Let’s see Joe “Brain Dead” Biden’s RIGHT NOW!!!!
Biden's platform committee already voted on #MedicareForAll and they voted it down. So unless he takes personal action, yes, it's certain #MedicareForAll will not be in the platform.
Some Biden supporters were way more offended than Biden ever was.
No, he's butthurt because I said he and Joe Biden didn't care. Did you see anything from him that looked like anything but an excuse not to care?
Don't waste your time trying to convince trumpers.  Recruit new people, independents, free thinkers and ex-Republicans to vote for Joe Biden to replace Trump &amp; GOP.
What about the people who already don't have any coverage at all or are severely underinsured because of the ACA?  You're still ignoring them. Like I said, you and Biden don't care any more than Trump did. You just want to check off an insurance box.
Health insurance isn't a guarantee of health coverage, particular under the ACA. Many of the people who will "lose their insurance" already can't use their insurance due to huge deductibles, and still have to pay huge premiums.  Joe Biden isn't offering to fix that problem.
Looks like she hates Biden and Trump. Who can blame her for that?
Check Biden’s basement.
I almost want to know who Biden is considering 4 AG More than I want to know his pick for VP.
Where did you pull out that completely meaningless and obvious statement?  Everyone knows that. Why pat yourself on the back?  Biden is in control of the Democratic platform and has a great deal of say in what happens after he gets elected. So why doesn't he care?
Who is running for president that wants to defund the police?  Trump and Biden have both said they are not for defunding.
That’s a good question. The problem comes from people not being as stupid as politicians want them to be. They know that, if healthcare is a right, then #MedicareForAll is the minimum required.  Biden keeps saying healthcare is a right. Dem primary voters were fooled too.
It’s true. He doesn’t. Neither does Joe Biden. Why aren’t you pushing him on health care, if you care? 🤔
If you don’t pick demographically correct you’re racist and/or letting Trymp win?  Fucking stupid on their part!  I’m voting Biden no matter what because I DESPISE Trump.  You want my vote ONLY? Or do you want a vote, a campaign contribution, volunteer, activist and enthusiast?
Adam Schaffer’s of course!  Warren should get VP to coalesce the party(finally a PROGRESSIVE!), have excellent policies, and also get an activist base and fundraising that Biden won’t with ANY OTHER of the options.  Harris as AG and Warren’s protege to run for President next
Don't make 400k or more a year. Don't care. Biden's plans directly benefit me. Yours don't
This is really personally disappointing. I have illusions shattered once again.  My Trekker pain aside, you should be pushing Biden to listen to people like  if you really want to beat the #OrangeTroll. If those voters are as important as you say, help them.
Unless Biden seeks a second term, then it could be 2028 before he leaves office.
This is Biden’s race to win or lose. The worst thing that could happen is you select someone that has some hidden Skelton or isn’t ready for prime time. Pick Kamala who has been vetted  and is prepared to be president
People whining about Biden taking to long to pick VP are even more annoying than the more aggressive advocates for particular candidates.
If you don't vote, or don't vote for Biden you are effectively making a choice for Trump.
Even if God themself comes down and says "Joe Biden will win in 2020", you still gotta vote for  as early as possible! Don't assume that any poll, article, or other-world guarantee insures a Biden victory. Only ALL of us voting for Biden will do that!!!! #AmericaOrTrump
You and Joe Biden had years to remake America! The Dems and MSM are trying to destroy America, along with Obama and G Soroes and you! We have had a taste of Make America Great Again, and we like it, a lot!
You’re right. Biden’s policies won’t save my wife’s life and that’s kind of my top political priority right now.
Biden won’t stop Bezos, Musk, and Gates from killing me. I will still be dead.
You mean Brain dead Biden???
If you did not understand Biden in the video, it's not a problem with his coherence but your lack of a basic vocabulary and ability to comprehend full sentences.
Hey Patriots, it's another Karen.  Cuban-American Republicans attack potential Biden VP pick Karen Bass over Cuba ties  #SmartNews
Trump bans Tik Tok, Biden bans you. We can live with that.
It's still several weeks until the RNC nominating convention and I can't help but Wonder if there is going to be a change in direction.
RN here. He's getting IV bruises either from anticoagulants or Serum meds for covid. He shows signs of TIA so that makes sense. But he could also be getting antiserum for covid. No transparency?
Gary I agree with you 100%. I'm 65 and I am more than willing to get into a street fight with Trump. Would I am not willing to do is put up with the Democrats eating their own when they don't like who Biden picks for his VP. That bullshit has to stop now.
Hidin’ Biden looking for cover.
Biden is unavailable period.
And that’s why the investigation into Biden has yielded nothing.🙄 You really believe anything Trump serves you, even when no indictments follow. Meanwhile, Donald and sycophants blocked all testimony, even his own from impeachment proceedings.
Hidin’ Biden must be defeated.
The Supreme Court has been infected with Trumpism this is going to be a real problem moving forward that will need to be addressed as soon as Biden is elected.Impeachment must be on the table. Having justices that intend to dismantle our democracy from within cannot be tolerated
I would swap 1 and 2 only from the perspective of carrying swing states. Biden gonna win CA no matter what. Demings at VP might lock in FloriDUH. As far as Biden maybe being 1-term on purpose, Harris is the strongest heir apparent, if you will.
Absolutely not and is once again a desperate and sleezy attempt to get joe biden in the White House by far left radical turds
oh boy! quite the potential running mate.  Joe Biden's vice presidential contender Rep. Karen Bass praised Scientology at a 2010 ceremony  #SmartNews
All the stupid people follow you. It’s a case of the dumb loving the dumber... keep telling everyone that if we just stopped testing the virus would “disappear “. You have guaranteed a Biden win. Even Trumpers aren’t going to ignore their dying relatives
Completely agree I don’t wanna have to suffer through 90 min of the moron while he tries to bully Biden because he’s not smart enough to do anything else. Everyone’s already decided it’s not like we’re dealing with unknown factors ,most of America wishes we could vote sooner.
Liberals are pushing a joe biden jock strap that also protects agaisnt covid ya u can wear it over your face I'm ordering one and sending it too ya I mean u can protect yourself and support joe biden at the same time🤣🤣
She did what good friends do: tell you when you made a mistake. And Biden took the criticism like a good friend and corrected for it.   The only people still upset about that exchange are supporters who can’t let it go like the candidates did loooong ago.
Love this lady. My favorite quote: If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair. One of the original "persisters".   Shirley Chisholm blazed the way for every Black woman Biden is considering for VP
Good luck with that....🤮🤮🤮
Nice try...TRUMP 2020!!!
He didn’t molester right?? Move along.
China has seriously damaged USA with Wuhan virus, these seeds will complete the job. China needs Joe Biden!
#MedicareForAll and I'd vote for Biden.
Chris Dodd should NOT be vetting Biden's VP candidates.
The Biden campaign demands it.
Biden would be a fool in my opinion not to have his finalists as Warren and Harris.  Either works for me.   The knives that are out for Harris by some Biden advisors are silly and frankly make me angry.
CUZ nobody cares &amp; they ONLY know political Kazuki theater. &amp; Biden SUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS  "so care everybody!"
If Biden were to get Covid and die, Bernie would be the democratic nominee and Trump could and would beat Bernie.
Not to be a conspiracy nut but the only chance that Trump has of winning is for Biden to get Covid and die and you can bet that Putin, Erdogen and the Saudis are trying to put an infected person in Biden circle
Just like him saying he'll hold up the election. We'll get a new POTUS on 1/21 regardless and if its not Biden, its Pelosi. He's too stupid to understand the law.
Counting on some voter rolls being purged, machines rigged, ballots changed and others not counted to give him a 2 percent edge but increase in voter participation alone by democrats will swamp Trump let alone all the independents that will switch to Biden b/c while they don’t
OMFG! I just read this thread. Are you people fucking serious? It does not matter who Joe Biden pics as his VP. We will not bitch, we will not complain, we will support him and vote. Get over yourselves! Are any of you doing anything to help people get registered or to vote?
if you vote biden he has to smell your boys hair. Thats how he keeps his hair.
You insinuating Biden is a pedophile?  I mean hate the dems, hate the system, overthrow whatever but WTF you accuse a guy of being a pedophile? Is Obama not a US citizen too? That BS came from the same people.
2020 presidential debates to be hosted by Ric Flair.  Trump and Joe biden to trade insults back and forth on Zoom via a 56k connection.
LMAO.  Chuck Ross, who will never get a real journalism job because of past racist authored blogs about blacks and whose followers are mainly QAnon cultists, has taken it upon himself to vet Biden's VP picks ...because they're black.
When Pew Research calls and you have to pretend to be a Biden Bro so you don’t get canceled.
I'm old enough to remember that when Obama picked Biden there was a huge flap in a lot of Dem circles. That noise went on until the convention was over and it was obvious that there was a chemistry between the two. This partnership is like a marriage. Same wavelength all day long
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Florida teen arrested in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama
No we don’t. I’m a Bernie voter and Biden has my vote just as Clinton did in 16. You’ve killed 150,000 and tanked our economy. 95 days until we vote you out.
Until then please vote for  in 2020. If you don't vote, or don't vote Biden you are effectively voting for Trump.
Little Gym Jordan should’ve gone to work and stopped the team doctor from molesting all those kids at Thee Ohio State University. So will  ask a question today or just jack off to his own voice for another 5 minutes. Stop waisting the countries time Little Gym. #Biden
The ONLY person I liked less/hated more than Biden was Delaney. And no one remembers who he is.
The Washington Post. Because they are so loyal to Biden.
Trump 2020 - joe Biden won't get it done he's worse than trump. and he's not a change he was already in the white house for 8 years nothing done really
It is about degrees. I hate Biden but I loathe Trump. I am leaning toward despising Biden but that still is a hair short of loathing. This is voting in America, for me.
Joe Biden’s tv commercial says he wants to keep Americans safe and healthy. So we can expect him to challenge his own platform committee forcefully on #MedicareForAll.  Right? 🤔
Biden will pick Kamala because she is the most prepared to be President and she will absolutely turn a VP debate into a SNL highlight film making Pence look so stupid. God I wouldn’t want to debate Kamala, she is a verbal assassin just ask Kavanaugh
Kamala is the most prepared to take the helm of the presidency. In many ways she would be a better choice than Biden himself.
Biden knows some people who like to stroke leg hair.
Here's my honest answer man. I don't care about Biden's cognitive abilities. They could wheel him out Weekend-at-Bernie's-style and I'm still voting for him.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
Can someone make a Biden bumper sticker that says, “Biden: he doesn’t have rallies that’ll kill you.”    Too soon?
I see young kids, who don't remember Byrd very well, showing pictures of Biden with Byrd in the 90s or early 2000s and condemning Biden for doing the photos I say, "Actually, by that time Byrd was much better on race than Biden and shouldn't have had his picture taken with Joe.
Yes you do, but sadly the Canadian People's Party (I was sparring with a Canadian Biden troll) is more like Donald Trump.
The Suburbs of America will Vote for Joe Biden.   You failed America
If you are one of those suburbanites, and Biden does somehow get elected, I'll be sure to check back in with ya 😂 bc I promise u, u will be singing a MUCH different tune
"Even if Biden is guilty, he's still much better than Trump. So I believe Tara Reade but I'm voting for Biden."
Exactly!  Biden is center-right at best and would be far-right in the UK or Canada.
Biden is center-right at best and dangerously close to far right.
The Suburbs will Vote Joe Biden President.   #WeWillVote
SAY NO TO JOE BIDEN NO GOOD FOR YOU DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH NOT JUST THE NEWS ON TV THEY SENSOR WHAT YOU SEE &amp; SHOW YOU WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO SEE NOT ALL OF WHAT YOU SHOULD BE SEEING AND KNOWING TRUST ME ON THAT.The effect of cutting old and redundant regulations that have been on the books since the 1950s, and what this has done for the everyday person. Biden had 8 years to do that and did not.
Is Joe Biden Mentally There?  via
Russia targets Biden to keep their puppet.  China supporting Biden to hurt #PutinsPuppet = 🇺🇸 is no longer  our own country but a pawn in the world politics 😢.  #AmericaOrTrump
There’s a lot of this from left of Biden.  Not sure what you’re wanting him to do.  He’s been up 7-10 points for months.
You can trust the polls as much as you can the media.
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
"The problem with all of this talk about Biden and faith is that he professes to be a Roman Catholic. A Roman Catholic who just a week ago was proudly mentioning an endorsement from an abortion-rights organization."
Now hopefully these gamers will vote Biden
The crazies were lining the streets but the real voters will support Biden. Your followers will continue to follow you off a cliff like lemmings
Omg...so sad. Joe Biden is #NotMyPresident
- OMG the grandparent #Biden ad is ME...I am missing my grandchildren more than ANYTHING...and missing so much of their growth and development. I am freakin BITTER about the botched #COVID19 response. And #Iblametrump

I’m not for Trump, but electing Biden will drain the swamp just as much as Trump has.
Emanuel Macron shows up in Beruit to show support for the Lebanese people. Can you imagine Donald Trump doing that? No? He most likely hadn't even called them. What happened there is an example of failed Govt. Kinda like here. Vote for Biden 2020. It matters. Trump must go.
Biden said he didn’t want his kids growing up in a racial jungle
My trump follower landlord came by to fix our frig. I turned on MSNBC. Trump says Joe Biden is against God. I started laughing. He said all campaigns seasons are weird but this one is particularly weird. He went on to tell me that he voted for tRump &amp; he is an ass. But I like
If you Google "images of Joe Biden praying" you'll see many different images of a man humbling himself before God - lost in deep in prayer.  See what you get if you Google the same thing for Trump.
So you’re saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven’t been able to do? Sounds like he’d be a powerful leader then.
She’s ridiculous, dramatic, and thinks Biden is terrific. (i can see through it, even though she claimed a filter)
Unlike Joe Biden, donald trump is a racist.
Also...IL.  Not exactly a place where you need to express your Biden love and GOTV.
"When Democrats and the press warn that Trump will try and override the election result, are they simply being hysterical? Or are they, as psychologists like to say, projecting?"
Not sure how it derails Biden. Probably hurt Trump more.
Also is anyone really out there jumping up and down that Biden is Democrat nominee...   Good lord he can barely talk.
That was my thinking.  These are either non-voters or Trump supporters.  I highly doubt this converts more than a few Biden supporters.  Those circles on the Venn diagram just don’t intersect.
Find me 50 black voters that were going to vote Biden and will now switch to Kanye.  Either they weren’t going to vote or are Trump voters...
Photoshopped pictures of Joe Biden in your latest ad. Notice how the Democrats don't have to do that? You look terrible all on your own. You're scared now so the ugly is coming out of you. Deutsche Bank records to Vance. You as one says are in deep doo doo.
Either or. I just want Joe Biden to be president &amp; he should decide the person with whom to share the ticket. Obama &amp; Biden trusted each other. Should be the same for Biden. Plus a majority black cabinet would be really cool. Talk about rooting out systemic racism right?
Oh, we need a lot more polling data to do proper analysis.  I just think it’s folly to assume Kanye pulls from Biden.  The two are in opposite universes unless “black” is your only criterion.  He’s much more like Trump than Biden, so his appeal should be similar.
Sure did Marsha the dude was  committing a crime. Why wouldn’t they order the AG to investigate. I don’t think Biden had the authority to order anything at that time now I think of it. #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
Biden knows about tRumps Adderall habit. He abuses it. Trump has been asked to take the cognitive test bc well just listen to him. Joe Biden has not been asked to take it bc well bc he is all there &amp; has an intellectual brain &amp; more importantly good character. Can't be said of 45
Also, the background was photo shopped on this photo. He isn't alone like it appears in the ad. We need to call this out. It won't stop. God only knows that they will photo shop Biden doing next.
Enter Hillary Clinton :) Jill Biden is more fit than Joe is for office.
Yeah, this won’t work.  Kanye is both nuts AND wears a #maga hat.  On top of that, polls I saw a month back had him pulling support from Trump, not Biden.
Conservative 79 year old mom said she can’t vote for Biden because “those democrats keep killing babies, those late term abortions are just awful, and they’re selling the parts” 😳🤯
If he were running against  or  I’d agree. Biden has the potential to crash and burn in the debates.
Of coarse Obama and Biden knew everything, about your team being Russian agents. The repugs card has been pulled. Start some more $hit, the country knows which of you idiots are played by putin. Game on mother fvcker, you and putin are done. #TrumpVirus
One screw-up after another by the catastrophic mayor of NYC. But they voted him in twice, so forgettaboutit.
Vote for Joe Biden
you have. Joe Biden is the man for this moment.
This stuff here Donnie is why u will lose to Biden. America is in pain right now. The randomness of tragedy causes humility. Joe Biden knows loss (loved ones). He has a humility that is what the country needs right now-good honest moral character, empathy &amp; humility-none of which
Lol, no way!  You too!? I usually get it for calling out Democratic hypocrisy on Joe Biden...
I wish Kanye luck.  He’s pulling disaffected righties, not Biden voters.
I really want to know why it’s a given that he’ll pull votes from Biden.  Polls I saw with him on them showed the opposite.  He’s a less-stable Trump but he’s black.  He’s still...not right in the head.
It’s a dumb move.  Kanye is more likely to siphon  votes.  He wears a #MAGA had and is a conspiracy theorist.  Why would he pull from Biden?  Because he’s black?  Alan Keyes sure didn’t get many lefty votes in his day...
He may get DOZENS.  And what makes you think he’ll pull from Biden?  The few polls I saw with West on them had him pulling from Trump.  The guy wears a #mags hat, man.
The pedophile is Biden
Might have it would have. And putting Biden in office you can kiss the whole human race goodbye!
Joe Biden please win this election I can't pretend to like liberals any longer
You can kiss this Karen goodbye as a potential Biden running mate.
I never thought I’d say this, but I’m starting to look forward to Biden debating Trump.   Biden is not a great debater, but even he can ask *one* question to get Trump to completely dissolve into a paper shuffling travesty
Watching the Axios/Swan interview &amp; I still can't believe tRump is POTUS. He is by far the most ignorant person in the world who is a leader of a country. The invisible accordion working overtime. He is a hideous human. Red eyes, can't stay on topic, hugely insecure. Vote Biden.
At least Biden can speak in complete sentences.
Appears most of the comments R from TDS sufferers, so I will balance it all by saying Biden is the worst candidate ever to be offered by a political party. You yahoos are planning to have the VP take over as soon as Biden bows out. Could have your VP stand-in for Joe and debate?
Freddy changes his tune.  Have we passed peak Biden?
Well there are many elections to come hopefully. It will matter mostly to get rid of trump or there may not be any in the future. I think we have some up &amp; coming Bernies out there. Keep the faith &amp; this time vote Biden 2020. It would have been nice tho. I hear you.
If Biden isn’t available, Trump should debate Kanye
I'd like to think so. But putting a former president in prison is something I don't see happening. The political fall out would be too much. Don't get me wrong, I want him in prison. But a Biden/Dem administration jailing him? Don't see it.
Great iidea!! Have Dennis Miller sit in for Biden?
Really.....is that all you got??? TRUMP 2020!!!!
Let’s see Joe “Brain Dead” Biden’s RIGHT NOW!!!!
Trump and Kanye should have a debate. Biden can join them if he’s up to it.
BernieBros will do anything to derail Biden’s campaign. They aren’t Democrats. Left wing tRumpsters
It's sad. Lots of people forgot what our whole primary campaign was about. It was never about just beating Trump at any cost or we would have just joined Biden and not even had a campaign.
Wait I thought the crime rate was going to go up AFTER Biden was elected??? Someone tell these criminals to hang on for another few months smh
You do know that it's possible to hate Trump and also not like Biden, right?
Gotcha. So, it's only okay to support what Andrew says when you also agree with him. When you don't agree then he made a mistake. Right. I agree. That's why I think he made a mistake in endorsing and stumping for Biden. 🤷
If you're wondering how Andrew feels about Trump voters... Well, here you go. How do you think he feels about third party voters or those who sit out or those who don't support Biden? Time to pause and reflect #YangGang.
Ok, how do you figure that? Biden is barely going to win this election, if he does. He also said he only wants to do one term, I know Obama said the same thing but this is vastly different most people don’t like Biden. Most people like Obama, because of his penchant for speaking.
Trump can debate Kanye, Biden can show up if he wants to.
That’s also what my conservative mom said 2 days ago. She said she’ll have to vote for Trump again because of the “killing babies” part. Other than that she’d go for Biden.
Someone needs to create a troll video NOW with Biden and Obama fighting Trump with light sabers.  Trump gets two small ones to move w/his hands every time he does that accordion motion he does.
No vote for Biden is a vote for tRump! PoliSci 101
In the bag for Biden: CO, MN, MI, and I think PA (his birth state)  I'd bet on Biden: WI, FL, NV, NH  I wouldn't bet on Trump: AZ, OH  True toss-ups: TX, GA, IA, NC  This is Biden-friendly ground.
Oh, Lord.  CO will be Biden +12 or something.
Why for Biden? I'm concerned.
That’s because, as of today, once Biden gets to a 6-7 pt lead, TX and GA come into play and, if you’re running a simulation that result in a 4-5 pt win, some scenarios show you at +6-7 and that’s when those states tip.
Looks like you can scratch one POC off Joe Biden's short list for VP.
During the time of Barry and Joe, China bought up land, housing tracts, corporations and flooded our market with cloned merch. Trump needs to nationalize all of it - but it’s the only leverage we have. COVID-19 and Chicom funding of Biden’s campaign are China’s response.
Yes.  Nov 3 when we elect Joe BIDEN!
All over my state Biden sticksers &amp; yard signs. No signs of trump. Even his followers are embarrassed any more. You sir are stupid.
You mean Brain dead Biden???
I don’t see why predictable is a problem for Biden.
Are this dense Joshua? I wasn't talking about Biden. Biden is a centrist. I'm talking about cancel culture. Yes, I have read Biden's plan and it doesn't cancel my debt. Learn to take a joke and stop following me. I helped you with the last part.
Really surprised at your inability to take a joke. This tweet wasn't even about Biden. I have read Biden's platform and he's against cancelling any of my graduate school debt.
Only undergraduate debt according to Biden's policy page. Most of my debt is from my graduate work.
Good luck with that....🤮🤮🤮
Nice try...TRUMP 2020!!!
He didn’t molester right?? Move along.
I remember millions loved Howdy Doody (Biden) and she’s up there with him as Princess FailedCommonSenseTest. While Ilhan is Clarabelle and Pressley is Phineas T. Buster’s wife, Tlaib is Chief Thunderthud.  Disney wants to reboot the whole series once they’re voted out.
You're incredibly wrong here. Saying we should all support Biden or we're off base makes us seem like a cult. That's the stuff Ori and Noah have been spreading. I'm against it and I'm speaking out.
You insinuating Biden is a pedophile?  I mean hate the dems, hate the system, overthrow whatever but WTF you accuse a guy of being a pedophile? Is Obama not a US citizen too? That BS came from the same people.
We're not even asking for much. I'd even go hard for Biden if he said he supported "the concept of UBI" or EVEN just Emergency UBI. Not asking for much here. Give me something.
You know what, Biden wasn't my first choice, but I am supporting him 100%, and I will continue to do the same if picks a ham sandwich for a running mate. People need to focus and not forget the peril we are in.
If you say anything critical of Biden then you're telling people not to vote for him now. You didn't know Matt?
You're deluding yourself. Biden has said he'd veto M4A and he isn't even for emergency UBI.
Have you taken a look at Biden's record? Sounds like you haven't. This argument was about Biden and not Trump. I hate Trump and I think  Biden is slightly better but still bad. Both things can true. The world is full of grey.
Biden isn't for UBI. I support UBI candidates. Where's the disconnect? Biden isn't for single-payer healthcare. I support candidates that support that. Where's the disconnect?
Ironic because everything that I do has been to help down-ballot Yang Gang candidates since Yang dropped. Being critical of Biden isn't necessarily "trashing" and one can be critical while also supporting the down-ballot.
I have a feeling that Biden has a special important cabinet position for Liz Warren. Something to do with the economy.
Nor will President Biden as he has stated more times than you
Exactly! Also, we never liked establishment Democrats or why the hell would be have been Yang Gang? We want a smart savvy outsider and that's not Joe freaking Biden. He's more of the same. He won't even support Emergency UBI right now. That's pathetic.
And who did that? Both Democrats and Republicans. Lots of Biden's friends, too!
Dear #Resistance,  Please evict Trump from your head.  States run elections on the date set by Congress; the EC elects the President on the date set by Congress.  Trump's power is equal to Biden's (read: nonexistent) here.  Here's why he's floating this:
...and NOTHING about Trump or his campaign operation says "competence" to me.  He'll tweet about it, get bored, say he was treated unfairly, challenge some votes, blah blah blah.  But he doesn't have any more power than Biden does here.  Sorry.
Same. Tweets are the least of our damn problems. Biden needs to come out for UBI. At the very least emergency UBI. He's out of touch.
Little Gym Jordan should’ve gone to work and stopped the team doctor from molesting all those kids at Thee Ohio State University. So will  ask a question today or just jack off to his own voice for another 5 minutes. Stop waisting the countries time Little Gym. #Biden
SAME.  I see Warren as having the stomach &amp; mind for the fight ahead, which Harris hasn't shown. The Biden administration can be diverse like America, but it needs to do so with personnel matched to their own best positions.
Biden is like the lowest common denominator for the Democratic Party and that's *still* a fucking huge improvement on Trump.
Go hide in your basement with Biden.
'Cheat-Sheet' Biden's 5 Simple Kamala Harris Talking Points Revealed
#MANA Make America Normal Again. Vote Joe Biden 2020.
Exactly James. I'm not going hard for Biden. I may vote for him while holding my nose but that's different than offering my support! No, thank you.  However, I'll likely vote for Mark Charles because he's at least pro-UBI and has better ideas to make things better.
Kamala Harris would literally be the worst person joe Biden could pick for a VP... like any chance at rallying all of the left behind him would just vanish
Biden called this shit months ago and the trump lickers mocked him for it.
Didn't Biden predict this?
Remember when Biden banned raves? lol good times jk that sucked.
Biden wants to protect ACA by giving larger tax credits and expanding Medicaid. This is fine but it won't solve the overall cost issue like single-payer would. His public option is a Medicare buy-in but no details listed anywhere.
Also, Yang speaks highly of everyone and he would do the same for whoever the nominee ended up being. I don't understand why this is hard for everyone to understand. Biden is highly problematic. Look at his record. It should be obvious why I won't go hard for him.
Trust his instincts? Why are you acting like he's the only one supporting Joe Biden? Everyone is stumping for him. He's the Democratic nominee. It's not some radical position. Again, we are not the cult of Yang. I don't have to support Biden bc Yang does.
This thread is worth reading. I hope Biden has a special seat picked out for her in his cabinet!
Is the Burisma issue ever going to surface?  We have the poster boy for dementia, the Dem candidate Biden, on TV bragging about withholding a billion dollar loan to the Ukraine unless a prosecutor investigating his son’s company is fired? A quid pro quo, and do not let it die!
Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me ! Easy way to get Biden out the way ! Can some say “The Clinton’s “ are involved! Lol 😆
This means Biden rallies are still happening 😜
Sadly, I think they're just trying to keep spirits up... by sharing anything we know showing Joe Biden *could* win.  Personally, if I were ever to hear someone say their vote wouldn't matter, I'd give them the long explanation, then the short explanation, then... 😠!
Covid-19 will disappear, as if by magic, on Nov. 3rd if Biden wins. If Trump wins - no church, no school, masks required everywhere, no attendance at sports, social distancing, further destruction of the economy, until Jan. 21st, 2025.
Ugh these ethical questions. Ok so I would probably put on my Biden 2020 cap (which I keep in my car) make sure my mask is snug &amp; help them. I would be nice &amp; polite so they understand that's who Democrats are. You?West, in text interview, indicates he is in fact running to siphon votes from Joe Biden.
No, even my pet spider, Barry, said he &amp; his spider clan were voting for Biden ... then he ate a mosquito.🕷️
Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
Liar- Biden doesn’t stand for the radical left-wing. It’s just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
Yes, I’m 62 yrs old, diabetic &amp; I smoke cigarettes, I will quit when Biden wins in November. I might have to wait until January bc trumps voice &amp; antics, being pathological liar, constantly embarrassing us along w/ #ComplicitCorruptGOP makes me smoke more, UGH!! Can I sue them?
Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
Joe "the racist" biden
CORRECT! Thank you President Biden!!
He’s absolutely wacko and sounds very, very desperate.  Grabbing at everything he can think of to try to disparage Biden.  Guns, God, Energy.  All in the same breath.
He is only going to get more and more unhinged as we get closer to election day...... soon, he'll be saying "Joe Biden is just a bunch of snakes wearing a trenchcoat!"
Joe Biden doesn’t treat women as sexual objects for one!! Trump has had everything given to him, threatens people for other things, lied and cheated and he’s failed at all businesses he’s own. It’s taken executives at banks and others who invested with him to bail him out!!
We can send ballots without the debate Donald. Mr. Biden should not debate you because you prevaricate and bully. It will be a waste of his time.
I'm not sure if you've mentioned this, because I've been on a deliberate media blackout, but I think the left has something planned that's so big Biden makes a convenient Fall Guy.
A Fourth debate to try and get it right at least the fourth time. He can’t handle Biden anyway.
I assume I can't just pick "who do I think should be President" in this scenario (probably Romney - sorry :) ). Of plausible Dems before Biden limited, Klobuchar (who I would have preferred over Biden for POTUS). Between Rice and Harris, I'm not certain. It's hard for me...
Biden will accept the nomination remotely as is far and away the only way to be safe. We need as many people as possible to be able to stay safe.
I'm intrigued. Who, exactly, are these voters that a) take the time to vote; and b) think "Biden was my guy, but Yeezy is on my ballot!"?   (and who are the GOPers that are willing to spend money on this idea?)
Not overlooking anything with Biden- Trump’s mentally unwell and unstable to be leading along with being a sexist misogynist, racist, xenophobe, homophobe who is using his position for his own family’s position and wealth. trump befriends all fascists. DISGUSTING you’d vote Trump
In all due respect for Biden- why should democratic candidates be tested, show birth certificates, taxes and be held at a higher standard than the corrupt baffoon in office?
Purely in terms of strategy, Harris seems like the obvious choice for Biden (not who I would prefer). Passes C-in-C test, voters know her to enough of a degree that it prevents defining her, least likely to depress any bloc of voters. Leaves election as referendum on POTUS.
The media is not covering, Biden is kicking trump's ass without straining. And, since you have a bumbling idiot that lies constantly for a candidate…
We did, but you were too drunk to remember.😂
Can we see Biden’s interview next?
Ronna. Please highlight ,in Biden’s plan ,where he said he would defund the police and then post that.  Click-bate much? Monsters. The lot of you.
Here is a good opinion piece in the WSJ countering NYT. I apologize if there is a paywall. Otherwise you can find it on Twitter.
I agree. We need her strength and fire in that role. But if she doesn't want it, then VP fine too.  I think she'll hate that job though. And Rice would turn it into a powerful addition to Biden, and be a great interface with the international community.
Filled out my ballot and proudly voted for Joe Biden. #biden2020
Good thing he supports Biden.
2020 Electoral Map Ratings: Trump Slides, Biden Advantage Expands Over 270 Votes
Ever hear about vetting? That’s why #trump and his band of incompetences always have, “acting” ppl in charge. He always announces who he wants before they completely check their backgrounds.  VP Biden knows what’s at stake for this presidency.
I’d crawl a mile over broken glass to vote AGAINST you no matter what Biden surprise you come up with in November. Yes, you are hated and there’s nothing you can do about it.
No matter what, trump will be gone on January 20, 2021. If it's not President Joe Biden it would automatically become madame President Nancy Pelosi!  YEAH!
Joe Biden would be toasting marshmellows over the fire.
Only the 300 million people who have died from it in the US... Isn’t  that what Biden claimed at one point?
After Biden is inaugurated in January, we need an independent commission to investigate the Trump administration’s mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic. Individuals—including Donald Trump and Jared Kushner—should be held criminally liable for mass American death.
Good point. The Bush’s are probably voting for Biden, unforgivable knowing what we know now.
Kinda like Biden - if you aren't smart enough to follow the conversation, I can't help you...
Obama/Biden plotted a coup attempt, seems newsy.
Surveilling U.S. citizens in the line of duty and fully within their constitutional rights. This is how fascism comes to America.   The Department of Homeland Security needs to be dismantled in the Biden Administration.

I concur. There are more qualified candidates for VP. Harris would be a great AG.
I got a $1,200 class action check for Safeway last year. I didn't even file for it. Maybe I win .... 😂Even if Joe Biden gets elected to the white house he will still be Obama's butt bitch
When Joe Biden was vice president of the united states all those 8 years he was President Obama's butt bitch all those 8 years and Joe Biden is still Obama's butt bitch
No one is worried about Biden himself. Biden is now a puppet for the extremist Left...and yes the Left does have power and depending on your definition of "God" and "destroy" they can and will do that as well.
“Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions.” More proof Biden sees black Americans as a monolithic entity.
When people see Biden try to “speak” without preparation or a teleprompter...yeah I’m guess a lot of votes will be swayed.
I think you meant “Biden family”   You were referring to the Burisma documents the Feds confiscated today yeah?
Would be easy- Biden is a jogger
No.  Trump vs Biden is actually Fascism vs Freedom.  Or, Lunacy vs Sanity.  Even Dictator vs Democracy if we don’t get rid of Trump and #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
No you have it wrong Biden is going to lose.  The only thing Democrats care about is power and control.
The lesser of two evils is the better choice when choices are down to that.   is pure evil.  Biden is not.I’m having a hard time today... I just can’t anymore with 45*’s and the GOP’s lies, especially regarding Joe Biden and the democrats. I know he’s projecting and desperate, but enough is enough.
Sylvie,Biden apologizes bc, even at his age and his many years as a prominent leader, he is human, therefore fallible, and is willing to both learn and embrace the changes his behavior requires. I’d rather have an honest penitent than an irresponsible and unapologetic nincompoop.

In the past week, two separate and very painful videos have circulated showing Donald Trump and Joe Biden the presidential nominees of the two major US political parties in action. Watching them, there’s only one conclusion we can reach: we’re so screwed.
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden told NPR on Thursday that while he was unsure if it was “good for democracy,” if elected he would not stand in the way of a hypothetical Justice Department prosecution of President Donald.....

Lol he was QUOTING the mayor of New Orleans in 1985. The mayor of NOLA was a mean racist ans congress (with joe Biden) told him to piss off. So no he did not say that , troll
Any white person who turns away from Biden for choosing a Black woman as VP is racist. This election requires a Black VP female candidate. The strength and dedication of Black women is needed by our country.
trump can’t keep his bullshit straight. One day, Biden is a senile old man who can barely stand. The next day, Biden is destroying the Almighty and the Bible. Which is it?

This is the thing I don’t like about blk dems. If we as blks can’t escape from being victims if Biden laws no matter who’s potus. Then why blk dems constantly letting Biden escape from his accounts of Biden law. Unless the CBC is full of sambos. How can they let this man slide
This why he stick for all the targeting laws as if god wrote it. His laws are responsible for many unlawful deaths in the blk community by corrupted cops. Then you got these blk dems who act as if they don’t know Biden as if he’s a good guy.
I remember a quote about joe Biden that I see is happening today. Joe Biden has made everything a death penalty for blacks except j walking. I added the black bc at that time and even today he want to see blacks eliminated.
When I heard about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and the many of ppl that died by the police to factors comes to my mind. 1 is slave patrol and the cops are the samething as well as the feds making it public that the police is corrupted. 2. This is the results of BIDEN LAWS
Watch: Fact-checker meticulously breaks down how the Trump campaign ‘egregiously altered’ Biden photos in new ad
So Biden admin would rather spin $280 mil on ads with black targeted media brands then actual black media. That says a lot about the person the dems want blks to vote for.
Nice of you to campaign against Biden.

Ugh!! Bad choices
Did some research on how powerful blk media is there is over 2 million ppl listening to straight blk media. And that’s just on yt with the same message reparations no tangibles for blacks no black vote and Biden is the worse of the worse of racists
Biden is the same dude who wanted a blk men who sold crack to get the death penalty while his son snorted and sold coke and get a slap on the wrist. Biden is hitler for blks.
Biden is targeting Republican-leaning states like Georgia and Texas, where Democrats haven’t seriously competed in decades.
Leading VP contenders have had to endure the usual criticisms men often direct at women – which has undermined a historic selection process

Just remember it was joe Biden that have us getting killed by cops. This is what he wanted. I’m paraphrasing his quote Biden has made everything a death penalty ( for blacks) except j walking. Obama pushes that one with the blue life law. Now if you black do you really want him

Biden can always change his mind. The alternative is unpalatable.
Biden has pledged to select a woman and is facing calls to choose the first Black woman to compete on a presidential ticket.
This is a very solid call on the white women who supported the p*ssy grabber mostly out of dislike for Hillary. Sen. Harris has been on my choice list, first with Warren, and now with Biden. I lived in CA practicing law for 20+ years and I both like and respect her.
The vetting has resurfaced internal party divisions between the old-guard establishment and a younger generation that's more attuned to gender and racial biases.
I don’t know what it is but i always mix up joe Biden and Bill Clinton
A president should preside. Biden knew how to veep as Obama's second in command. Biden won't court disaster.
Warren voter here and friend of many other Warren voters. Among serious candidates, Biden was the last choice for most of us. But I guarantee every one of the Warren voters I know will crawl across broken glass to vote for Biden.

The presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Joe Biden, told Donald Trump “to step up and do your job” on Tuesday, highlighting that it had been a month since Trump most recently predicted the coronavirus would “just disappear”.
We really don’t need any debates. Trump won’t shut up, he’ll make faces, he’ll heckle, just like he did last time.Trump has no plans for anything. We will vote for the anti-Trump Biden because anything is better and Biden is experienced and decent.
Oh lort? Have you been pumped full of disinfectant! You must be so impressed that trump was able to identify a camel and elephant in a dementia test....Good grief, compared to trump, Biden is Einstein!

We need a capable, strong administration that brings America together. What happened to United We Stand?  Bring it back wit Biden
What is disrespectful when the dems keep telling black ppl to vote on hitler 2.2 oops I mean Biden. That’s disrespectful. Just as disrespectful as the American hitler 2.1 talking about me. Carmichael when he’s the guy who followed hitler 2.2 laws
The presumptive Democratic nominee has made inroads among white voters.
This way... the 45* cult talking about Biden 👇.  I told this person, he/she spelled Trump wrong. Unbelievable...the fine art of projection.
But black will never forget slavery Jim Crow the war on drugs and Biden law or Obama housing crisis. These are all black holocausts and to vote for a man who created one of them is voting for the devil.
I can compare joe Biden to hitler I can’t really do the same with trump I can compare trump to any slimeball ny white business man but joe for me and many black oh this is hitler. You see all this that’s going on right now most of it will be forgotten
In a show of solidarity with Biden, I am hereby not picking YOU for VP.  I, however, remain available.
But then won’t say nothing about joe Biden racism. Matter of fact they treat joe as if ,in his own words, “he knows what best for the negro”. He think jails and slavery is the best thing going. This is why we must vote no on joe.

Kamala Harris likes to portray herself as a progressive, but the California senator has said that tech giants like Google must be allowed to grow unimpeded.

Vote and return ourballots as soon as possible!  Biden and his competent team are gonna be so busy fixing all that Trump has broken.
I'll like him until the election is over (that is, until after the Biden inauguration).
Yes, we have Vice President Biden as our nominee.  And you have donald as yours.  See you in November.
And, actually that’s really sad! Because that means that absolutely nobody cares about what Joe Biden has to say. They’re just going to vote for him regardless. Because Donald Trump has fucked up so bad that no matter what Biden says he’s going to win the vote.
I have wondered for a while if a trump campaign plan is to get the Biden camp to release a pandemic plan and then see if they can win an electoral college majority from folks voting for death.
I happy for every single vote that changes from Trump to Biden. I'll welcome them and hope they bring more with them.
Victory for Biden in 2020 is a victory for Western democracy akin to the fall f the Berlin Wall and the defeat of the Axis.  If we pull it off.  If we fail, it will be a disaster equivalent to an Axis victory or the fall of NATO to the Warsaw Pact.
Do black ppl really want to vote for joe Biden who is responsible for over a million black men locked up and thousands on thousands dead right now today by the hands of police. He’s responsible for the Obama laws which of right now got all ppl in debt and suffering
Matter of fact even though it haven’t been easy it’s been a cakewalk under Donald trump then any of a white senator laws that was made in 1994. If you think I’m lying ask all the dead black ppl and the ones locked up about the affects of Biden laws.
Here is the truth that dems aren’t going to tell blacks and the other political groups won’t say. That blacks survived slavery Jim Crow  joe Biden laws and Obama housing crisis Donald trump is the least of black ppl concerns.

Looks like it was all progressives asking Biden to pick Bass so I'm ruling her out
The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
I really hope they don't shaft Biden if Trump loses. He literally gave up his last couple of years of functionality. I disagree with his belief that it was necessary to save the republic, but that sacrifice should be recognized regardless.

Yeah they're two old guys who say stupid shit, but one is a goddamn racist and fascist who will continue to sell us out to line his own pockets and the other is Joe Biden.
Joe Biden is a flat out racist. If Trump had said what Biden has said in recent days, lefty media would have completely melted down. But with Biden, not a peep.
She's got a wealth of administration experience, though, and that goes a long way, since Biden's mind is (how to put it diplomatically?) shot.

I was so thrilled when I saw "sexism" referenced in the headline for your column about Biden's VP search. "Someone is actually talking about this!" I thought. But no. You weren't addressing the fact that men are exempt from the pool. No one calls it sexism, but ...
Biden finds himself in that uncomfortable position we are all familiar with:  choosing the lesser of two evils.
Joe Biden is Catholic, first of all. Second of all, in all my years of Sunday school and learning a whole ass different language to go to church/school... the second amendment didn’t come up. Hunters were given a hard time. Like what?
Understand you called Joe Biden  racist. Well did you?
Can anyone tell me why the republicans think this would take votes from Biden?
please ask those Democrats how Will Biden be President if he NEVER comes out of his basement!!!
Absolutely! And the GOP will be dead for generations. Boomers are dying out (faster because of Trumps Covid response) and Millenials &amp; Gen Z are left of Biden.
Sally Yates will be in Joe Biden's cabinet!
Imagine Biden being elected president and saying to foreign dignitaries "C'mon man!" Scary thought.
Sally Yates should be Biden's Attorney General.
Biden would embarrass Trump because he has solid plans. Trump’s credibility is shot, nobody is gonna buy all the greatest things ever that he will claim.
Either Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. I'm leaning toward Warren because she could draw more Progressive Democrats out to vote for Biden. This strategy worked for JFK incredibly well in 1960.
Bumbling biden
The debates should be fact-checked as soon as Ass-hat starts talking!  It’s going to be brutal! It’ll be like Ass-hat taking a knife to a gun fight!  Ass-hat should be the one trying to get out of the debate! Soon to be “President Joe Biden” will wipe the floors with Ass-hat!
At least that is President Trump’s own daughter in these pictures. Biden gets cudley with OTHER people’s kids.
At which rallies? How is Biden holding rallies during the pandemic? Just wondering.
Y'all gonna feel very let down. Biden isn't going to be debating anyone.
There isn't going to be a magic band-aid that brings all the Bernie voters to Joe Biden, lol. That won't matter anyway if you pick someone that most people would passively accept in their heads, if nothing else as being just typical liberal business-as-usual shit.
Pastor Who Sold Soul to Devil, Angry About Competition!
That's not to say Biden couldn't find more progressive women if he wanted to. Obviously, he doesn't want to. So you look at what's there, and you have Karen Bass, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris who have any significant progressive credibility.  Pretty easy choice for Biden.
No surprise.  Also, I think, aside from Warren, you don't get any more progressive of a VP pick by Biden. Despite her cop background, which isn't going to sit well with a lot of people, she has more credibility than he does on any one of a number of policy issues.  Example:
Dr Jill Biden will be a breath of fresh air, compared to Melanie the Ex (we believe) Hooker FLOTUS.
😂😂😂😂😂 And you say Biden can't speak correctly. This is just one of many verbal goofs you have made Donny.
Frankly I wouldn't blame the Biden campaign for just skipping debates. Any debate will just be 45 lying his ass off and yelling for 2 hours.
Putting pressure on Ukraine to get dirt on biden! Telling people that everything is fake news while he flat out lies to the public. Siding with putin over our own intelligent agencies. Sabotaging our institutions by installing people to destroy our institutions!
The truth is, there is no VP candidate currently being considered that will improve the ticket. Biden is pathetic, and his VP selection will be worse. I would delay it as long as possible too.
I am born Canadian and I have faith that we the people will end this debacle in under 100 days by electing Joe Biden and maybe overturn the Senate, too.
Could we do a census recount after Biden? Would that be legal? I know it would be expensive but
Shit like this is why I’m not voting for Biden, I’m not feeding the corporate politicians my vote
This is absurd. Can we open the census back up if Biden wins? This is criminal.
My timeline is full of debates about Ellen, Biden's VP and fancy Lunchables
Read the Unity Task Force recommendation and realize that making all of that possible is impossible and any attempt will ruin our currency and seriously raise our taxes. Biden signed this document and is committed to it.
No one will be making up their minds based on debates. No need for them at this pt, IMO. But, watching Trump sweat and snort compared to Biden composure would be reassuring.
You keep saying everything would be so bad under Biden, but it’s already incredibly bad under your leadership...
could Biden In fact sign ONE executive order as POTUS that overturns all of Trump’s exec orders or will he have to undo them one by one? Seriously. Not meaning to be glib.
Biden supporters believe scientists and follow CDC guidelines of avoiding crowds, wearing masks and social distancing. That's why they didn't show up to protest you. You and your small crowd didnt follow any CDC guidelines. Show us proof of the thousands &amp; thousands you speak of.
I will get behind anybody that Biden picks, period.  He’s the one doing the vetting.
Biden Leading Trump Among Voters Who Favor Being Alive  via  Ha ha ha only dead people favor Trump!
What damage are you speaking of? From our perspective the President communicates that he only wants the 🇺🇸to succeed. Joe Biden has said he will let radical left wingers tear 🇺🇸down to rebuild it as a lawless cesspool.
To show that Biden knows his shit and Trump clueless
Oh, what utter nonsense.  Another day of wild delusional fraudulent baseless accusations from the tweeter in chief.  #Biden
Biden/Bass Biden/Harris Biden/Rice  Extremely boring choices, low energy, low enthusiasm, part-of-the-problem candidates.
Biden best stick to his plans for the nation when he speaks in debates and out on the stump. Skip the lesser of two evils schtick
Respectfully, That is a little narrow view of it. Kamala is in Ca, but Biden is going to easily take Ca. There are strategic considerations, like it or not. Imo, doesn’t make Biden coward. Demings might swing Fla. Rice is most experience on world stage and we need that too!
I think he will resign citing “medical problems” to save face. That way Pence can pardon him &amp; he can say that he would’ve beaten Biden if he had stayed.
Biden is withering and pathetic by comparison. Go Trump! #KAG2020
Please, Joe Biden! #PardonForRealityWinner
Uhhh! No we know who the lier is and it is’t Biden
Joe Biden doesn't use Twitter.
(Do I love Pelosi? Nah. Would I take literally any non-GOP woman over Biden? In a heartbeat)
Don, right at this point do you have an estimate of the percentage of Biden’s chances of winning?
How does this work in Trumps favor? His VP is Pence. Is he really arguing that Biden choosing a POC as a VP that isn’t Latino shows he doesn’t support Latinos But Trump choosing Pence shows he supports Latinos? Wtf
💯 Auntie! Blocked ElizDrew. What a stupid thing to say! On contrary, it is comforting to see Biden make thoughtful considerations. Of course, historically, VP running mates are not named much before convention. Who is this Eliz Drew? Is she just seeking relevance? Fail!
It's called vetting, just because the Trump admin ignored that process for the past 4 years, doesn't mean Biden shouldn't do it. Relax people
Donald Trump Jr. takes on Twitter censorship, Biden campaign on 'Watters' World'
Sean Hannity warns Mark Levin America's role as 'the shining city on the hill is riding on this election'
I have some issues with every one of the possible VP choices, none of which are as big as my issues with Biden himself, so I just want him to get it over with so I can stop caring
I live in liberal PDX Oregon &amp; have only seen “1” Biden sign!!!😂
You could not be more incorrect. He ad vice President was part of the red line to Syria. Which killed 500k children and old people with nerve gas. That's blood on the Obama and Biden hands. As far as covid . Trump saved many thousands of loves by stopping flights from China.
What has Biden done in 47 years of being in the government?
I'd rather have Biden / VP who might possibly be a dumpster fire than Trump, a known dumpster fire.
Which is why we’re voting for Biden!!! #AmericaIsStrongerWithBiden #DumpTrump #DumpTrumpDayNov3
Well just combine the celebration with Biden's inauguration.
And they say Biden's creepy.....
Give Biden 4 years and Chinese will be our national language
Hiding with Hunter Biden
I will vote for Biden no matter who he chooses but I like Rice a lot. I like Val Demings too. Demings might be my first choice, just strategy-wise. She is from Florida and we need to take Florida!
Great question!! No tax returns, no debate. Trump would just lie anyway. Biden has my vote.
I've NEVER heard of a man being called "TOO AMBITIOUS!" Indeed, is 'ambition' not something we desire in a 'male' candidate?   What is more 'ambitious' than a white, male, Republican?  Joe Biden has a wealth of ambitious, experienced, educated &amp; smart women from which to select.
Joe Biden is a racist to Hispanics.
Trump will not debate Biden. He is scared shitless of debating Biden, that is why he keeps saying Biden refuses.
What are y’all’s feeling on Biden vs Trump debates?
Joe Biden narrows down his VP list, with Karen Bass emerging as one of several key contenders    now we actually are going somewhere!! Sorry Gop. Your normal party sucked. Your trump party is terrible. Don’t you guys ever watch the news? His briefings!!.  ?
Joe Biden: not a *confirmed* pedophile yet. Either way, better this pedophile than the other one.
Excellent placement ... w Biden/? &amp; various lib govs, we might actually make some progress.  That would be great.
is that joe biden
I'm raising 3 grandsons, and if school's do NOT open, Well they wont be doing online school. Im just not computer savvy.the left is so frantically trying to end trump, Well they could care less if kid's get schooling or NOT.i cant see anyone in their right mind voting biden.
Right... another good one for AG would be Swalwell.  I see him as POTUS in 2028.  There are MANY good ppl &amp; I hope Biden can bring them all into the circle &amp; use all their talents.  Warren is a dyn-O-mo! - I want to see her renovate public education.  o-mo!
Maybe Biden is getting that feedback now.  I'll support whoever the nominee is.
Or M4A? Think how we could be more productive 8n the marketplace? We are a nation of consumers, are we not? So, why not support it, Creepy Joe Biden?
I like Warren - a lot.  I honestly think she can accomplish greater things such as revisioning the education system - my #1 priority.  However,  ... &amp; this is true for whichever woman Biden picks, is that she'll be put into the VP 'role' &amp; her hands will be tied.
Me, too.  We need both right now.  Biden is excellent w ppl &amp; compassion &amp; Harris scares the criminals..... so?? lol, what's the decision?
YES!  I hope we get pages so Biden can see them &amp; his advisors as well.  HARRIS - ALL THE WAY!  you-who!!
Man, your parents really did hurt you, didn't they! You are a sad petty man in search of praise. True Leaders actually lead without the need for acknowledgment of their performance. Biden will be sooooo much better than you!
Rice has too many associations w the past; it would open up all the events of the time.  Just sayin' - there 'many' good ppl.  I hope Biden finds ways to use them ALL in a team approach to put the USA back on a secure track to move the country forward &amp; lead the world once again.
PLEASE choose Karen Bass.
Chris Wallace talks Biden VP pick, 'embarrassing' Barr hearing and Trump 'stoking a brush fire'
What about His son Hunter getting millions from U.S. aid to Ukrain deal. As well as 1.5 billion from trip to China. STINKS to high heaven. I have to question your judgement on voting for Biden. Have a good day. And thanks for your service.
Sorry 😐 don’t know where you get your info? This shot started with Obama/Biden!
All of his ads have increased Biden’s lead. For the very first time from my fingertips: thank you, tRumpie!
#GOPBetrayedAmerica before. They're doing it now, and it's going to get intense. What Happened to Stacey Abrams Will Happen to Joe Biden  via
trump may try to say Biden is afraid to debate him.
Of course, clean up time by Biden. How much of his time.
I like the sound of JoE Biden’s America though!
After a Joe Biden speech!😀
I don't care what anyone says. I am Republican. But I really liked Barack.  My age, He gets it!!  In my opinion I thought he did a pretty good job as President. He knows!!  Biden is going to need all the help I can get. I feel sorry for Joe he should have retired!
The only thing Biden will do good at is forgetting that he’s president..
You owe Joe Biden an apology for this hit piece from April !
Republicans believe Joe Biden winning will whack stocks. Democrats presume re-electing Donald Trump is double trouble. A clear secret: they’re both wrong. Here's why, according to
So some big fake investigation into Biden, Obama, or Hillary??
Your term expires January 20th  at noon.  That day either Joe Biden or Namcy pelosi (if there is no election) will take power.  The Constitution is clear. No delay of election can save you.
With Biden the US might end up like the rest of the world did without the economic near depression trump has put us in. The US is on course with other third world countries like Brazil! The USA is no longer the global leader and respected as a democracy!
While Biden gives the appearance of caring what has he actually done for America? In reality he’s manipulative, arrogant, misguided, foolish, deceptive, corrupt &amp; in the pocket of the extreme left &amp; China. He pretends to be for the common man but is an elitist in sheep’s clothes.
Today, Mitt Romney. A year ago, Joe Biden.,
Yes.  Sides have been drawn.  Trump's support has been holding steady at about 40% .  It's down from his avg of about 45% but close to his all time low.  Support is in the south but waning in his swing states in 2016.  MI, WI, MN are looking at Biden.   N-S again.
We deserve to know who paid her to make those accusations and MSM needs to make public apology to public and Biden, IMO
LOL... yes, why now?  at the most, they have 6 mos left &amp; now she's going to tear up the Rose Garden (read hx) &amp; add her own "Midas" touch to it?  Perhaps red Christmas trees all made of roses in an eerie Portia environment?  I'm sure Jill Biden can put it back together again.
Biden deserves to have his name cleared. She deserves jail for lying &amp; all media should be apologizing for putting out her story w/o more research first. Most importantly, who put her up to it? Not okay to shove under the rug, imo. If we ignore it, they can pull that shit again!
Sorry, but I think everyone deserves to hear the truth. She should be forced to admit that she lied, on air. Media and everyone should apologize to Biden and learn to look deeper before spouting or repeating shit! To just have it fade away w/ a shrug seems wrong.
Maybe so. But doesn’t the media have a responsibility to report that her story was fabricated? Don’t you think Biden deserves a huge apology?
Does anyone know what happened re Tara Reade? Disappeared from media. If proven that she made false claims, why? If still claiming Biden assault, what is the status of the case?
Especially since Biden is running for President after being VP. Good lord
#realDonaldTrump  Mr. President when is your big Debate with X VP, Biden?  just haven't seen him take questions from media's. Please have someone send me the Big Debate date and time. Thanks sorry to bother you but can't seem to find it.The inevitable conclusion of a society that values wealth over everything.   Dems are part of the problem. I will vote for Biden once, then I work for progressives.   Collapse is imminent. Wise to cash out, own real property as paper wealth won't have value (for about 3 yrs) soon
Dems clearly are lost in their bubble. The longer they're allowed to live in the bubble, they'll become more like Republicans.  I will vote for Biden once, then I will immediately work to defeat corporate Dems &amp; replace them w/ progressives.
I see him hurting Trump more than Biden as only crazy, ignorant people would vote for Kanye or Trump.
I’m kinda white I’m definitely voting Biden. It should be a no brainer no matter your race creed or religion.  #ripjohnlewis honer him VOTE #VOTEBIDEN
My former dad did that a lot. Beat my mom for what he was doing. So I am very familiar with what Trump is doing.  Sooo.. Trump for prison 2020. And Biden for president 2020.
Are you saying you’ll vote for 45 if you don’t like Biden’s veep pick? Asking for myself.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. More lies. You literally don't have a clue what Biden will do. All you know is YOU'RE LOSING. Might have something to do with the crappy job you have done as President. November 3Rd we will MAGA without you. #ByeDon2020
Biden draws distinction on Black, Latino political diversity
Virginia Mayor Who Said Joe Biden 'Announced Aunt Jemima As His VP Pick,' Saw Nothing Wrong With His Racist Remark (and apparently he felt comfortable enough with his network of friends &amp; family to put it on Facebook).
Trump: “Biden is weak”  Also Trump: “Biden will hurt God. “  “...”
Schrodinger’s Biden: simultaneously weak and able to hurt god almighty.
political event where he slams Biden, lies about the corona virus and ALL on the taxpayer's dime!
Schrodinger’s Biden: simultaneously weak and feeble but able to damage an omnipotent God. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #ImpotusAmericanus #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden
#Thighland ... because he used too many technical words in a row.
It speaks very ill of Biden that the only way Trump can even try to differentiate himself from Biden is to lie.
No matter who he picks. Biden is a smart man he’ll pick a good running mate. Obama picked him. Pray this will be over soon
You are sickening trump. You are showing your desperation you’ll say anything to try to win back so many of voters turning to Biden. They see you for what you are. Antichrist
Biden was the first Catholic VP in US history.  Catholics make up a quarter of American voters (think Hispanic vote, amongst others). Once again, Trump is all about projection - he's the one without religion and more to the point, without a soul.
This is what post truth looks like.  Except no one cares. Not trump supporters, not Biden supporters.  (Btw he did say this. However, please reference second line above.)
We need Tish to stay put in NY, where she's kicking the dentures loose from Trump's entire empire. Biden's AG will be Kamala Harris.
Didn’t I just read the USPS union endorsed Joe Biden!? Yeah...like this isn’t a conflict of interest!
Plugs Biden participated and didn’t know he participated.  Sleepy Joe is loosing it!

I vote by mail since 1998. Not only am I going to vote I’m voting for Biden. He’s lying again vote by mail is safe, convenient, we have no voter fraud. Record turnouts. He knows he’s losing
We should not set up either/or choices when the reality is Black voters will turn out to vote for Biden bur Biden &amp; the entire Democratic Party have all ignored these systemic issues that impact Black voters each generation. Dems should speak to this now!
New Low for Trump &amp; GOP  GOP operatives with ties to Trump are actively helping Kanye West get on presidential general election ballots in states to siphon off black votes from Biden  Using a man with a mental disorder (West's bi-polar) is abuse &amp; an act of desperation  SAD
And we are all tired and warn out!  I echo Joe Biden in this pic. Look Christians!  This is what a real Christian looks like in humility and prayer. Remember?
Notice that I didn't criticize the possession of arms, just the veneration. I believe in an armed citizenry as a check upon tyranny. But I don't favor the adulation of violence, the use of battle as an arbitrator of first resort. I was finding common ground with Biden
Correct. That's the only reason why I'm voting for Biden.   Then I begin working to elect a #Progressive for 2024.   If Biden surprises me great, I'll change but he must prove it to me.
I'll fight for politicians who do not take Wall Street bribes.   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   #JusticeDems are the people I will fight for.
To those well meaning Dems who tell us not to highlight Biden's corporate record.   I ask you to consider the below accomplishments by #JusticeDems.   They are winning because they're telling Americans the truth, not pretending Biden is a champion of the working class.
No there is not. ALL think profit motive is best way to deliver social services. So corrupt.  Don't fall for John Kasich either.   Corporate Dems going to use Kasich as a prop, but Kasich will be rewarded by Wall St if Biden wins then lecture us how #MedicareForAll is 'bad'.
I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is my choice.  I will NOT pretend Joe Biden is not a corporate toadie. I will NOT take it easy on Joe Biden on health care, filthy oil.  We did that for Hillary &amp; Trump outflanked her on her left and lost.   Biden has a chance. Wall St or Main St.
Respectfully, do you really think America believes Joe Biden is a champion of the working man?   He'll win only because Trump is so vile. If R's ran someone moderate against Biden, Biden would probably lose.
To pretend Biden is a champion of the working class will not work Tricia. It insults voters &amp; corporate Dems better grasp it.   They tried that with Hillary &amp; lost to Trump (who ran as a populist).   We will not earn Indie votes by insulting their intelligence.
Had enough of U.S. Senators telling me "somebody better do something".   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump. The second he's sworn in, if he is, I'm working to elect a #Progressive in 2024.   #Enough of this crap. Zero left to give sir.
Biden is the only choice. But why haven't Biden and the Democratic Party addressed these issues as a priority? If they haven't done it before, haven't done it now, what will compel them to do it while in power when they ignored these issues in the past?
Biden lacks the vision, insight, knowledge &amp; capacity to speak with a compelling persuasive voice that can motivate young Black Americans. The Democratic Party writ large suffers the same malady. But the GOP is against their interests; what will they do?
White moderates agreed to the 1872 Amnesty Act &amp; "Great Compromise" of 1877 with white supremacists. White moderates don't want systemic change. They don't value Black lives over the status quo because they are status quo beneficiaries. Biden's value? He isn't Trump. That's it.

You mentioned guns being an important issue. What's your worry with Biden?
Biden is not a puppet, but an experienced national leader. He has seen horrors like the slaying of George Floyd, has heard voices like mine; And knows that our great America must serve a higher purpose than the mere accumulation of riches, while so many suffer in hunger and rags
#LetterstotheEditor: Today’s topics include democracy, the ongoing rejection of science, and Biden name-calling.
President Biden, don't debate an evil corrupt clownish idiot for the entertainment of his white supremacist constituency.  Instead, choose Elizabeth Warren as VP and let her go toe-to-toe with Mike Pence. Charge the viewing audience on Pay-per-View &amp; fund the economic recovery.
🎉 Happy Birthday Mr. President 🎊  America misses your compassion, your caring, your intelligence, your moral leadership. We can't wait until we have that again in Joe Biden.
Do not blame the big business healthcare system on Obama and Biden. It was there long before their 8 years and CONGRESS is who is at fault for changing Obamacare to be of no use.
Biden Selects Aunt Jemima As Running Mate
Yes, I do believe republicans would be relieved to vote for Mike Pence over trump. But I also believe smart people who voted for trump/pence and saw where that got us will vote for Biden to get America back to pre-trump America. Just my belief 😀
Their right about Joe.   I'm voting for Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.   I've had enough of 'we can't afford to use your money to help you, but we can bail out Wall St again.   Yeah, enough of that &amp; after this if Dems want my vote ever again they better wake up.
Biden voter...
#Pelois must ensure this bail out lasts thru January 2021 &amp; helps workers.  If shorter, Republicans will refuse to help right as Biden is elected &amp; blame everything on him.  Play political hardball like you've never played before Dems.

This is basically the final time Dems will have any leverage over Republicans before election and they have very real leverage right now.   Use it doggone it.   Or they will have nothing left except:  "Vote for Biden &amp; Nothing Much Will Change".
She can't without massive spin.   Biden is a tool, a corporate toadie tool oblivious to realities of being born with no money in America.

Katie Porter would be great in the Biden administration in any role. But she would send a shiver of fear down the cowardly spines of Wall Street thieves if she were Treasury Secretary.
Clyburn is the only reason Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee. His influence was sufficient to propel Joe from the political basement to the penthouse in a weekend. And most of the rest of the party fell in line in 24 hours even though Biden was a dead duck pre South Carolina.

Pssst.... Joe Biden is an older white man and part of the has-been establishment.   Just know this - I'm voting for Joe Biden ONLY because he's not Trump.
What have you done? Nothing but have 150.000 American deaths on your hands. We losing our shelter unable to work and your tweeting about Biden? Your going down to Biden your a joke.
Is she the best because she would be best ready to assume the duties of Commander in Chief should Biden fall?  Or would it not be great if we choose our leaders based on ability and not by an identity beauty contest?
I have to wonder why Pelosi, Schumer, Biden aren't making political hay from this.   Seriously, the Republican POTUS announced it yet isn't following thru on something so important &amp; Dems let it slide like no big deal.   I wonder why?

Pompeo hit with subpoena after he’s caught assisting Senate GOP’s political smear of Biden
Guys - we demand D's fight harder and when they do, we get nervous.   I don't like corporate Dems for sure, but they're right this time. If we took 4 mo deal, just as Biden wins power would swing to R's about evictions.   Come on team be strong. Don't cave now.
- I disagree Ana. Republicans must make a deal or evictions will happen under Trump.   Dems have leverage so now is not the time to give in. Finally, Pelosi playing hardball and she's right. Too late, but if cave then giving R's power when Biden wins.
Yes! George w took gop super pac funds from trumps campaign and gave it to Biden! Ouch gotta hurt    #ripjohnlewis honor vote engage to keep voting fair
Emma sadly, since a true #progressive seems out of the question I'm leaning towards Susan Rice.   May I ask your thoughts about her? There's a good chance Biden may not last 4 yrs. I don't wish him harm but at his age he can pass at any time.   Thank you Emma.
There goes Trump's October surprise!   The House issued a subpoena as part of an investigation into Pompeo's “apparent use of Department of State resources to advance a political smear of former VP Biden.”   Sen. Ron Johnson &amp; Devin Nunes are also complicit in the scheme
The way to do things is neither conservative nor liberal but with intelligence and finesse. We need balanced and effective policies to inaugurate a great American renaissance. Great works await your willingness to hear me. Otherwise, Biden will win as the reform candidate.
The numbers show it: Joe Biden is winning the presidential race by not really running  via   50% od #Biden2020 #voters said their MAIN reason for #voting for him was to #oppose #tRUMP

Yeah, right!  You saying that Mr. Biden had a hand in murder?!?!  That’s a new one!!  I guess you can say anything, can’t you??
I don't think any Democrat would mind welcoming President Pelosi. Let's say the election happens, Biden wins, Trump cries fraud, it ends up in court and he refuses to leave. I think if January 20th comes &amp; Trump hasn't left, the speaker can call the Secret Service or US Marshals.
Just because I like making predictions and — historically speaking — I have a 100% rate of accuracy, I’m predicting that Biden chooses Karen Bass as his VP.   Biden Bass 2020

I can’t think about that now. Biden can NOT lose this election.
Biden/Michelle perhaps more!
Sagaciously spoken, Mr. Biden. The youth are discovering the world of politics; It's good. But you really ought to reconsider your cannabis policy especially for medical patients like myself.

She has a point.  Will the Lincoln Project attack Pres. Biden for doing what he says he's going to do?  Restore environmental protections, raise taxes on the wealthy, expand health care, cut fossil fuel use, expand the safety net, etc?
Biden is pro baby murder. Nuff said
I do think that’s true in part. WHEN we elect Joe Biden as POTUS, we will have a sane President again who actually cares about ALL Americans including the ones who didn’t vote for him. That said: We have a rough road ahead to mop up 45’s &amp; his admin’s messes.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.
Most Americans don't have short term memory loss. America has the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. You, Mr. Trump, do a better job of lying and stretching the truth than leading the country. Biden will Make America Great Again! BIDEN 2020. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

TRUMP CALLED JOE BIDEN "GODLESS"--BUT JESUS SAID,          "DO NOT JUDGE"!  Attending Church once in ten years  Trump said publicly that Biden is "Godless"! He is LYING AGAIN!.  Biden is a Devout Christian--a lifetime member of his church.  But LIARS WILL GO TO HELL, Jesus said.
Trump’s latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional — even for him -
He is aware of the damage he will cost the good people of this nation. If he wants to get in the race to pull votes from Biden and award trump, he deserves ridicule and plenty of it.
Indeed! While VP Biden is outlining his many plans for helping America conquer COVID-19 and putting America back on track, 45 is using the same old tired game plan from 2016. Use VP Biden as the boogie man. Make up anything, no matter how outlandish. to land the vote. 👎

A debate will only help Biden. Everyone knows you’re a dumbass. They don’t need to watch you behind a microphone struggling to pronounce words and form sentences more than you already do.
Its possible. Personally I think its to late. Trump could demolish him on the debate stage and he'd still win. I think the hate people have for trump will trounce almost anything biden could do. We'll have to see though
Please note: 45 has not been telling us one thing that he intends to do in his next administration. His so-called campaign is all about making Biden the boogie man. Biden tells us every day what his plans are for his administration and that’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Ok I may not like joe biden... but I definitely like him a little more after this. That is my literal dream car
I'd vote for a junkie over Biden.

Don't care Mr. Biden.  Quit now,  save face.
Whoever thought of this ad deserves some kind of award. The fact the Biden winning is reward enough for them just makes their genius that much more aspirational.
I aspire to this level of NAILING IT by the Biden campaign.  Teach me your ways, oh wise ones...

CIA ignores request to brief GOP senators trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden’s son: report
Have you taken a cognitive test, Ari? Yes, the question is offensive on the face of it. The only reason it’s an issue is because Trump brags about something that we should never have to worry about with a President. Biden is tested every day and makes Trump look the fool.
Same goes for Biden.
A year from now they’ll be saying the same thing about Cori Bush because she clapped for something that President Joe Biden said or whatever

You all seem assured Biden will win - are you planning to let him out of his basement to attend his own inauguration, or by January will you declare him incompetent and just swear in his Veep as President?
I say this a lot on here and I really mean it. Anyone supporting Biden for public office at this point is guilty of elder abuse.  I was raised to respect my elders, the way he's being used turns my stomach. And I don't like the guy.
Right. Because communist/socialist/Marxist Russia totally wants to help pro-capitalist Trump🙄  But I will agree Russia (and China) wants discord in America. We see that on the streets in Democrat-run cities  Meanwhile, Joe Biden shifts policy heavily toward socialism/Marxism
Uh huh... you might consider just dropping out Mr. Biden, in order to save face.

$3 million from the Nice Famous Corp. Xu Xeuqing 2 the UPenn is only the tip of the iceberg. In May, The UPenn Biden Center came under fire over its alleged failure 2 disclose $70 million from #CCP fascist🇨🇳b/w 2017 &amp; 2019. #BeijingIntercouseJoe got $800k.
I welcome investigating everyone who can be shady.  The fact biden isn't acting like a b*tch like trump is shows trump is hiding something.   I say who ever is guilty needs to be held accountable.  I can do that with my people I support.  Can you say the same?
Dude. Unless its actually found guilty he is innocent till proven guilty right ? You use that line with trump and his 27 accusers. So until then. Let their be investigations. But its funny you want biden looked in to but when others do it to trump you guys cry witch hunt!!
Out and wore a mask 2 months ago like biden and others. Maybe his sheep would've followed him and numbers across the south and the nation would be lower. But no he crowned on people. And now 2 months before his exit. He's trying to be presidential. Come on man back to you :)

And he hasn't even mentioned the lies Biden has been caught in, the plagerism he had apologize for, and the many other times he's had to apologize for embelishing.
I think he felt sorry for the left having to always see how  Biden forgets everything and decided to throw them a bone.  😂
Will #BeijingIntercourseJoe return $800k he received from the UPenn Biden Center? Public records suggest the Nice Famous Corp Xu Xeuqing has no apparent connection 2 UPenn, funneled $3 million 2 the Ivy League school, &amp; is closely tied 2 #CCP fascist🇨🇳.
Someone remind #Biden that I'm his VP.  Anyways, thank you for the nomination and yes I accept.
Has anyone considered Biden might not run for a second term?  That he might work to get his VP and a Cabinet Secretary nominated while he's still in his 1st-term as the incumbent?

Don’t worry because #Joe #Biden won’t run the country either, #Susan #Rice, #Stacey #Abrams or another #Manchurian #Candidate will have the code.

If  does not give up his office to the new President  in January.. Biden as the President Elect can use the  and The Army to remove Trumps fat ass forcefully!
Biden will surprise a lot of people. The ability to work with Congress is underrated. I think we'll see him be very effective here. If he wins.
Oh the irony! Spending part of one's day to prove a quote by Donald Trump is 100% bullshit, but that quote is a response to a quote by Joe Biden that is also 100% bullshit. Thank goodness for checkyourfact, huh Jess?
That's funny because you think that makes your friends look bad. But meanwhile you don't even realize Joe Biden never actually said any on that. 😂
Really, because he committed to the debate. But okay, if you say so.
'This shit is actual reality." It's a picture of Biden and a quote he didn't say! It's the same bullshit the left pulled when they said Trump wants everyone to inject bleach. More shit no one really said.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying Biden will win the election. I'm saying painting Biden with this baby food-eating old man brush will backfire at the first debate. Setting the bar so low means he only has to seem semi competent and it'll make people rethink his viability.
Considering we're both commenting on a funny quote by Biden that is 100% fake, then yes, I'm saying he's being painted. I'm not saying it's a thick coat of paint. I've seen the same gaffes you have. All I'm saying is exaggerating his senility will backfire come the 1st debate.
This strategy of painting Biden to be a dimentia-having drooling old man will backfire when he beats Trump in their first debate (because historically the incumbent always loses the first debate) and it makes Trump look that much worse that a senile old man bested him.
is correct. I've been telling you that #BeijingIntercourseJoe is #Xitler's Presidential candidate who &amp; whose son Hunter Biden have been bought by #CCP China. Must watch the Manchurian Candidate movie. I like Frank Sinatra original version.
At the minimum GOPer Johnson is willing to commit treason to attack Biden.   THat is why you should insist that there be reporters at the convention.  They need a light shined on them.
He says, and I quote, "no, we will beat Biden fair and square". What part of that do you not understand?
I mean..I’m gonna be drunk and/or stoned when I fill in Biden’s name because omg is he a piece of shit but I can’t not vote. This is just a shitty election
One thing I notice when Biden speaks is that the Interviewer completely ignores and/or gives the Interviewee a Pass by acting that the Interview just answered their question in a coherent manner. This approach only makes the Interviewer/Interviewee look Stupid to the Audience!
Biden’s VP pick: A shrinking list of top contenders
I think the GOP insiders also recognize that Trump is toxic down ballot in a way that Pence is not. Biden's biggest asset is that he's not Trump. Take that away, and I think the race becomes much more competitive all around.
For real though, it's probably the GOP's only chance of turning this thing around, short of some sort of October surprise about Biden. But even then, they've flooded the zone with so much bullshit that it's hard to see anything they say being believed by anyone not in the cult.
Since #BillClintonIsAPedo is trending, let's not forget his good friend, Joe Biden, who is on camera, multiple times, inappropriately touching kids  #Biden2020

She’s a true weirdo I don’t know what to believe about Alyssa; I loved her as an actor but dislike her now that I see her true colors. She supports Joe Biden?? Wtf!!
I speak with a lot of truck drivers. Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Ukrainians, Romanians, Blacks, Whites..you name it. They are all voting Trump. They were broke under Obama and they are broke now because of the shamdemic.  Pretty sure only the Chinese are voting Biden.
Alright guys let's be real. I dislike this women probably as much as most of you. But if she puts REAL weight behind a #UBI, im gonna support her and biden (dont currently). The ultimate goal is #UBI, not being nit picky who implements it. Ideas?
We will, Biden will fix everything you’ve fucked up over the last four years!  #YesWeCanAgain
She got the WallSt money because she was Hillary's protege'. Connections.  Pelosi told Biden to pick Harris and he will.
And it seems to be working for Biden in this case. He has been rather quiet and quiet works when everyone slings feces and dirty laundry. I know we will learn... and we must hit some form of rock bottom before we realize our shortcomings. But we must learn to be better.
....and I want Elizabeth Warren, but I will give my support to whoever Biden picks without grousing about it.
I promise whoever Joe Biden picks for VP will get my full throated support....and I do have a favorite that I really want.

The virus, the economy, foreign relations will only start getting under control AFTER we elect joe Biden as president #Biden2020
But but the GOP is claiming the Joe Biden and all the high-ranking Democrats are in the pocket of AOC and the squad!!! Surely they arent falsehood peddling!!!???
If I could pick a VP, I'd go with Karen Bass or Nina Turner. But Biden has his marching orders. He'll pick Clintonista Kamala. Horrid choice.
Wow! I was only joking by calling #BeijingIntercourseJoe #Xitler's agent man 4 US President. Now Joe is Xitler's agent man Hunter Biden's father. That must be the real reason #CCP🇨🇳gave Hunter Biden USD$1.5 billion. Hunter Biden is the🌐's most expensive agent man. Xi pays 1 4 2.
Means that 27% don't know what is going on. And some have been bought by China, like Biden.
In these last hundred days huh? The choice is jolting into clarity...  Biden/? 2020  Oh, and um, Antifa!
We could talk about how Biden would handle the pandemic better? His top aide is the guy who ran the pandemic response for Ebola, which was handled really well. That’s a pretty clear material benefit to humanity.
I'm trying to understand what your arbitrary rules for what can be used as evidence and what suppositions can be made fairly. Biden has sometimes followed through, sometimes not. He's never been in executive power besides the ceremonial vice-p, not exactly a 1:1 comparison.
I understand how corrupt and disingenuous the Democratic Party establishment can be, but Biden has a health plan as well which will be marginally better and isn't like Trump who has actively been trying to boot millions of people off insurance for 4 years with no replacement.
Ok so you want to argue based on your vague suppositions about what Biden might do in his presidency, but you don’t believe any actual policy positions he’s running on? So you’re just arguing from your feelings, and you’re an accelerationist like I said, just be honest about it.
Ok so your argument is that Trump is significantly better on foreign policy enough to matter on foreign policy enough to override all else? Biden has a better climate plan than Trump’s accelerationist rollbacks. I’m making logical arguments not emotional, I know they both suck.
#BeijingIntercourseJoe received $800K from the Penn Biden Center of the University of Pennsylvania after he was no long a VP. The Penn Biden Center received #CCP funding. Is Joe #Xitler's agent man running 4 President? If NOT, Joe should return $800K🇨🇳$ to the Penn Biden Center.
Are you trying to say that Biden would drone strike people more than Trump? Trump *massively* increased drone strikes in his first 4 years over Obama. Obama did the Iran deal which was good, Biden wants to get us back into that. Some material benefit is always better than none.
I understand that all politics is local, but if this is real, it's disqualifying for me.  I'd still vote for Biden though.
Eating a fried turd is still better than eating a fried turd laced with cyanide if you’re at the point where you have to choose one. Both are shit but one has less of a chance to kill you. The only intellectually honest argument for not voting Biden is an accelerationist one.
Or perhaps the "Do Nothing Committee" it fits perfect since Biden did nothing to become the nominee and they are going to #DoNothing for working people.
Ignoring the fact that this reply is false as to be completely bonkers, $67k is peanuts compared to what Biden’s family has gotten during his political career.
Trying to talk to people is almost impossible. They have there "hot takes" that must be true and most these hot takes are used to dehumanize people. Its hysterical. People will here someone talk once and assume they know them perfectly then turn around and support biden.... lol
I'm doubtful that those suspicious lunatics are gonna vote for Biden regardless. Whatever VP Biden chooses, there will be some supposedly disqualifying, horrific thing about them that the GOP will promote and Fox News will sell like it's going out of style.

A debate will only help Biden. Everyone knows you’re a dumbass. They don’t need to watch you behind a microphone struggling to pronounce words and form sentences more than you already do.
Its possible. Personally I think its to late. Trump could demolish him on the debate stage and he'd still win. I think the hate people have for trump will trounce almost anything biden could do. We'll have to see though
Please note: 45 has not been telling us one thing that he intends to do in his next administration. His so-called campaign is all about making Biden the boogie man. Biden tells us every day what his plans are for his administration and that’s why I’m voting for Joe Biden.
Ok I may not like joe biden... but I definitely like him a little more after this. That is my literal dream car
I'd vote for a junkie over Biden.
#Democrats won’t consider outlawing #ANTIFA because the domestic #terrorism outfit is comprised of pissed off #Bernie #Sanders supporters and without them #Biden won’t win. Fuck the law abiding #Democrats whose businesses were looted and burned because they still  #vote #Democrat
Mr. Biden's statement: If you vote for Trump " You ain't black ".
Don't care Mr. Biden.  Quit now,  save face.
Whoever thought of this ad deserves some kind of award. The fact the Biden winning is reward enough for them just makes their genius that much more aspirational.
I aspire to this level of NAILING IT by the Biden campaign.  Teach me your ways, oh wise ones...
What the word salad bullshit is that? They make fun of Biden because he loses his place in speeches sometimes due to a stutter, but thinks THIS is coherent speech???
CIA ignores request to brief GOP senators trying to dig up dirt on Joe Biden’s son: report
Have you taken a cognitive test, Ari? Yes, the question is offensive on the face of it. The only reason it’s an issue is because Trump brags about something that we should never have to worry about with a President. Biden is tested every day and makes Trump look the fool.
Same goes for Biden.
A year from now they’ll be saying the same thing about Cori Bush because she clapped for something that President Joe Biden said or whatever
Trump ads on Facebook about Biden and police are false, fact-checkers find - The Washington Post
America was great before you got elected. Biden will make America great again! BIDEN OR BUST.
You all seem assured Biden will win - are you planning to let him out of his basement to attend his own inauguration, or by January will you declare him incompetent and just swear in his Veep as President?
I say this a lot on here and I really mean it. Anyone supporting Biden for public office at this point is guilty of elder abuse.  I was raised to respect my elders, the way he's being used turns my stomach. And I don't like the guy.
Right. Because communist/socialist/Marxist Russia totally wants to help pro-capitalist Trump🙄  But I will agree Russia (and China) wants discord in America. We see that on the streets in Democrat-run cities  Meanwhile, Joe Biden shifts policy heavily toward socialism/Marxism
Uh huh... you might consider just dropping out Mr. Biden, in order to save face.
Biden acts like a troll bot. 😑☹️
You sound like a bot for Biden. 👈🏼 is that a hashtag yet? It should be.
Get INSANE TRUMP out!!! Plus Biden knows what he is doing.
BIDEN ONLY WINS IF WE VOTE!! PASS IT ON!
Republicans have a clear favorite for Biden’s running mate -
Trump exposed his cluelessness during Axios interview — and gave Biden all the ammunition he needs: GOP operative -
biden is probably going to win... the popular vote!
If it was Israel, then they weren't doing it for love of Obama/Biden. You're not going to risk starting a war with a neighbor for someone who makes you come in through the garbage entrance
$3 million from the Nice Famous Corp. Xu Xeuqing 2 the UPenn is only the tip of the iceberg. In May, The UPenn Biden Center came under fire over its alleged failure 2 disclose $70 million from #CCP fascist🇨🇳b/w 2017 &amp; 2019. #BeijingIntercouseJoe got $800k.
I welcome investigating everyone who can be shady.  The fact biden isn't acting like a b*tch like trump is shows trump is hiding something.   I say who ever is guilty needs to be held accountable.  I can do that with my people I support.  Can you say the same?
Dude. Unless its actually found guilty he is innocent till proven guilty right ? You use that line with trump and his 27 accusers. So until then. Let their be investigations. But its funny you want biden looked in to but when others do it to trump you guys cry witch hunt!!
WTF? Really? What about the "emails" ? "Lock her up"? Huh? Repugnicans now have nuts? Their testes have dropped. Ain't that special? Got balls now!  Someone should explain to the new #WonderNutsRepugnicans Party the  "Yeah, but what about..." don't work!
Out and wore a mask 2 months ago like biden and others. Maybe his sheep would've followed him and numbers across the south and the nation would be lower. But no he crowned on people. And now 2 months before his exit. He's trying to be presidential. Come on man back to you :)
Smile more? Some critics see sexism in debate over Biden VP (from
And he hasn't even mentioned the lies Biden has been caught in, the plagerism he had apologize for, and the many other times he's had to apologize for embelishing.
I think he felt sorry for the left having to always see how  Biden forgets everything and decided to throw them a bone.  😂
Will #BeijingIntercourseJoe return $800k he received from the UPenn Biden Center? Public records suggest the Nice Famous Corp Xu Xeuqing has no apparent connection 2 UPenn, funneled $3 million 2 the Ivy League school, &amp; is closely tied 2 #CCP fascist🇨🇳.
Someone remind #Biden that I'm his VP.  Anyways, thank you for the nomination and yes I accept.
Has anyone considered Biden might not run for a second term?  That he might work to get his VP and a Cabinet Secretary nominated while he's still in his 1st-term as the incumbent?
joe biden would be a pretty good president
Don’t worry because #Joe #Biden won’t run the country either, #Susan #Rice, #Stacey #Abrams or another #Manchurian #Candidate will have the code.
#Joe #Biden might be a dementia patient but a delusional #VP like #Stacey #Abrams can easily delude everyone into thinking that she can run the country better than #Trump.
#Joe #Biden may not know where is when he gets there but his #VP will.
#Joe #Biden might be a total #idiot but his #VP #choice with really run the country.
#Joe #Biden may just be an empty suit but his #VP #choice will flesh it out. #Joe #Biden may just be an empty suit but his #VP #choice will flesh it out.

It looks like he's smelling her for an uncomfortable amount of time and enjoying it. Weird af. Creepy af. Classically Biden af.

I love you Bernie but I cannot in good conscience vote for Biden. #DropOutBiden #StillSanders2020
"Biden shouldn't debate because lockdown and COVID"   Yeah and I shouldn't box Mike Tyson for the same reasons.
If  does not give up his office to the new President  in January.. Biden as the President Elect can use the  and The Army to remove Trumps fat ass forcefully!
Biden will surprise a lot of people. The ability to work with Congress is underrated. I think we'll see him be very effective here. If he wins.
Oh the irony! Spending part of one's day to prove a quote by Donald Trump is 100% bullshit, but that quote is a response to a quote by Joe Biden that is also 100% bullshit. Thank goodness for checkyourfact, huh Jess?
That's funny because you think that makes your friends look bad. But meanwhile you don't even realize Joe Biden never actually said any on that. 😂
Really, because he committed to the debate. But okay, if you say so.
'This shit is actual reality." It's a picture of Biden and a quote he didn't say! It's the same bullshit the left pulled when they said Trump wants everyone to inject bleach. More shit no one really said.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying Biden will win the election. I'm saying painting Biden with this baby food-eating old man brush will backfire at the first debate. Setting the bar so low means he only has to seem semi competent and it'll make people rethink his viability.
Considering we're both commenting on a funny quote by Biden that is 100% fake, then yes, I'm saying he's being painted. I'm not saying it's a thick coat of paint. I've seen the same gaffes you have. All I'm saying is exaggerating his senility will backfire come the 1st debate.
This strategy of painting Biden to be a dimentia-having drooling old man will backfire when he beats Trump in their first debate (because historically the incumbent always loses the first debate) and it makes Trump look that much worse that a senile old man bested him.
is correct. I've been telling you that #BeijingIntercourseJoe is #Xitler's Presidential candidate who &amp; whose son Hunter Biden have been bought by #CCP China. Must watch the Manchurian Candidate movie. I like Frank Sinatra original version.
At the minimum GOPer Johnson is willing to commit treason to attack Biden.   THat is why you should insist that there be reporters at the convention.  They need a light shined on them.
He says, and I quote, "no, we will beat Biden fair and square". What part of that do you not understand?
I mean..I’m gonna be drunk and/or stoned when I fill in Biden’s name because omg is he a piece of shit but I can’t not vote. This is just a shitty election
One thing I notice when Biden speaks is that the Interviewer completely ignores and/or gives the Interviewee a Pass by acting that the Interview just answered their question in a coherent manner. This approach only makes the Interviewer/Interviewee look Stupid to the Audience!
Biden’s VP pick: A shrinking list of top contenders
I think the GOP insiders also recognize that Trump is toxic down ballot in a way that Pence is not. Biden's biggest asset is that he's not Trump. Take that away, and I think the race becomes much more competitive all around.
For real though, it's probably the GOP's only chance of turning this thing around, short of some sort of October surprise about Biden. But even then, they've flooded the zone with so much bullshit that it's hard to see anything they say being believed by anyone not in the cult.
Since #BillClintonIsAPedo is trending, let's not forget his good friend, Joe Biden, who is on camera, multiple times, inappropriately touching kids  #Biden2020
Biden can drink water and walk down a ramp, not to mention listen to doctors so 150K people don’t die.  But cool story, bro!  #MAGAts
She’s a true weirdo I don’t know what to believe about Alyssa; I loved her as an actor but dislike her now that I see her true colors. She supports Joe Biden?? Wtf!!
I speak with a lot of truck drivers. Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Guatemalans, Ukrainians, Romanians, Blacks, Whites..you name it. They are all voting Trump. They were broke under Obama and they are broke now because of the shamdemic.  Pretty sure only the Chinese are voting Biden.
Alright guys let's be real. I dislike this women probably as much as most of you. But if she puts REAL weight behind a #UBI, im gonna support her and biden (dont currently). The ultimate goal is #UBI, not being nit picky who implements it. Ideas?
We will, Biden will fix everything you’ve fucked up over the last four years!  #YesWeCanAgain
She got the WallSt money because she was Hillary's protege'. Connections.  Pelosi told Biden to pick Harris and he will.
And it seems to be working for Biden in this case. He has been rather quiet and quiet works when everyone slings feces and dirty laundry. I know we will learn... and we must hit some form of rock bottom before we realize our shortcomings. But we must learn to be better.
....and I want Elizabeth Warren, but I will give my support to whoever Biden picks without grousing about it.
I promise whoever Joe Biden picks for VP will get my full throated support....and I do have a favorite that I really want.
Joe Biden nears final decision on running mate  (from
Chip in to elect Joe Biden
The virus, the economy, foreign relations will only start getting under control AFTER we elect joe Biden as president #Biden2020
But but the GOP is claiming the Joe Biden and all the high-ranking Democrats are in the pocket of AOC and the squad!!! Surely they arent falsehood peddling!!!???
If I could pick a VP, I'd go with Karen Bass or Nina Turner. But Biden has his marching orders. He'll pick Clintonista Kamala. Horrid choice.
Wow! I was only joking by calling #BeijingIntercourseJoe #Xitler's agent man 4 US President. Now Joe is Xitler's agent man Hunter Biden's father. That must be the real reason #CCP🇨🇳gave Hunter Biden USD$1.5 billion. Hunter Biden is the🌐's most expensive agent man. Xi pays 1 4 2.
Means that 27% don't know what is going on. And some have been bought by China, like Biden.
In these last hundred days huh? The choice is jolting into clarity...  Biden/? 2020  Oh, and um, Antifa!
We could talk about how Biden would handle the pandemic better? His top aide is the guy who ran the pandemic response for Ebola, which was handled really well. That’s a pretty clear material benefit to humanity.
I'm trying to understand what your arbitrary rules for what can be used as evidence and what suppositions can be made fairly. Biden has sometimes followed through, sometimes not. He's never been in executive power besides the ceremonial vice-p, not exactly a 1:1 comparison.
I understand how corrupt and disingenuous the Democratic Party establishment can be, but Biden has a health plan as well which will be marginally better and isn't like Trump who has actively been trying to boot millions of people off insurance for 4 years with no replacement.
Ok so you want to argue based on your vague suppositions about what Biden might do in his presidency, but you don’t believe any actual policy positions he’s running on? So you’re just arguing from your feelings, and you’re an accelerationist like I said, just be honest about it.
Ok so your argument is that Trump is significantly better on foreign policy enough to matter on foreign policy enough to override all else? Biden has a better climate plan than Trump’s accelerationist rollbacks. I’m making logical arguments not emotional, I know they both suck.
#BeijingIntercourseJoe received $800K from the Penn Biden Center of the University of Pennsylvania after he was no long a VP. The Penn Biden Center received #CCP funding. Is Joe #Xitler's agent man running 4 President? If NOT, Joe should return $800K🇨🇳$ to the Penn Biden Center.
Are you trying to say that Biden would drone strike people more than Trump? Trump *massively* increased drone strikes in his first 4 years over Obama. Obama did the Iran deal which was good, Biden wants to get us back into that. Some material benefit is always better than none.
I understand that all politics is local, but if this is real, it's disqualifying for me.  I'd still vote for Biden though.
Eating a fried turd is still better than eating a fried turd laced with cyanide if you’re at the point where you have to choose one. Both are shit but one has less of a chance to kill you. The only intellectually honest argument for not voting Biden is an accelerationist one.
Or perhaps the "Do Nothing Committee" it fits perfect since Biden did nothing to become the nominee and they are going to #DoNothing for working people.
Ignoring the fact that this reply is false as to be completely bonkers, $67k is peanuts compared to what Biden’s family has gotten during his political career.
Trying to talk to people is almost impossible. They have there "hot takes" that must be true and most these hot takes are used to dehumanize people. Its hysterical. People will here someone talk once and assume they know them perfectly then turn around and support biden.... lol
I'm doubtful that those suspicious lunatics are gonna vote for Biden regardless. Whatever VP Biden chooses, there will be some supposedly disqualifying, horrific thing about them that the GOP will promote and Fox News will sell like it's going out of style.
Fliescher was the guy who was all “Biden is irresponsible for suggesting Trump wants to delay election” as well
Can we just lol  how  and his supporters just "wont accept" the results if Biden wins?🤣 too bad so said mother %$*+%!
My current nightmare scenario is a Great Schism where blue states recognize a Biden Administration and red states recognize Trump Term Two
Biden should legalize weed = less bail.
I understand you but, we REALLY should have a freeze on rent.  just got a job last week after being out of one since all of this started. A freeze would be nice, instead of my sister and her child struggling to help me live. Biden is kind of insane but no other choice really
You, sir, owe VP Biden an apology in writing. Your spurious opinion piece of 4/24 was myopically intended to discredit the VP. He put forth a plausible scenario that’s come to fruition. I’m sure a man of your integrity(?) can do the right thing! Consider #VoteBlue
It’s the “Bernie Bro’s” of 2016.  This entitled group of little whine asses will just take their ball and go home if they don’t get EXACTLY what they want.  Biden wasn’t my first choice, hell he wasn’t even my fourth choice but I can’t do four more years of this shit!
Senator Tammy Duckworth, Vet Pilot &amp; Iraq War Hero, rec'd a purple heart for horrible injuries. She is the first Thai American elected to Congress.  Duckworth--a wife, mother and fighter--is on Joe Biden's "short list" for V-P.    Washington Post 7/30/2020
You are just scared of not winning!! You will be defeated! Biden 2020!!
You all get he's signaling right? He's saying the right things so we'll believe Biden can be swayed by Obama and feel better about voting Joe. But he's secretly telling donors, of course that isnt happening. He then doesnt have to follow through because it was "Joe's" decision.

I love this. Also, those saying not voting isn’t an option and we have to get Biden in...do they not realize that Trump is rigging this as we speak? No way we get legit results. Gonna be worse than 2016
No one did shit when Breonna died.  This is hive mentality and the protests will not end unless Biden wins.
Yes,  she's my pick because once we are through  #trumpsCOVIDdisaster, we will need an economic &amp; financial wizard to crawl out of the depression.  However,  I will vote for Biden regardless of who he picks.
Confuse them a little. Say, "Yes. But not nearly as much as George Soros offered to pay me if I would support Joe Biden."
The fact that Biden promised a progressive woman VP then hired noted sex pest and corporate bank hack Chris Dodd to pick which woman is peak Biden candidacy.
Hasn’t Biden already said he’s aiming to be a one-term, transitional president? Don’t most VPs ... want to be President? This is so stupid.
Democrats are not Socialists, my dear, just as you are not truthful. Fair minded folks know Biden is not an extremist, but is a true Patriot.  The GOP no longer represents Conservatives, allowing Trump to spend the country blind and ignore the Pandemic.
Well, with Biden being at such an advanced age, being ready to be pres should be an important criteria.
After the food is done in 16 minutes it will rest and will do more postcards to voters.  TiK Toc.   Today the official thug secret police began a theoretical egress from Portland's BLM march .  Hopefully all will go well tonight.  Hug to all sane Biden supporters.
Once again you apparently can't hold complex views whatsoever. Even if Biden doesn't improve much healthcare-wise a public option better than Trump who has been trying to kick millions of people off health insurance completely with no replacement for his whole presidency.
Once again insulting. It should tell you that I would not take this decision lightly that I'm a survivor. Voting for Biden doesn't mean he's going to legalize rape or something. I view this choice for president as picking which enemy I want to fight for the next 4 years.
Oh so you only care about what *you* want? I'm a sexual assault survivor and advocated against Biden harder than anyone I know, still believe he's probably a rapist. Still going to vote for him, it's insulting that you would try to use that as a bludgeon against me.
I'm hesitant to believe that Joe Biden even uses "anarchists" with any intent outside of referring to people causing "chaos" at protests, none of these boomers have any idea what they're saying when they use that word
Allies would support Joe Biden’s choice for Vice President. Period.U.S. Intelligence: China Opposes Trump Reelection; Russia Works Against Biden
How about we refuse to recognize the continuing Trump regime and instead recognize Biden as the legitimate President and refuse to cooperate with the U.S. gov until Trump is removed from office, by U.S. military, if necessary?  How about we lobby foreign govs to do the same?
I've waited 8 hours for Biden to say something sane, so why not.
Is it true the Rethuglicans are encouraging your bit of nonsense here to fuck with Biden's chances?  You have to know your chances of being elected are so minuscule as to be less than 0 so you're either ego-driven like Donnie or nuts like Kim keeps saying...
Joe's arriving a bit late to the election reform party. Trump operatives can steal states where no recount is possible because of e-voting. Trump just might win easily. Biden can protest the results, but the MSM will probably just 'sour grapes' all over him. #CluelessJoe.
Actually he's ignoring and refusing almost everything we demand of him. :/ Joe Biden is straight down the middle, completely unbeholden to us radical leftists. His campaign is negotiating with progressives like Bernie Sanders and AOC, but the left is compromising more.

You know any “debates” will be a reality-based shit show where the content will be how well Biden can withstand rude and threatening moves by Trump.  No content will really be discussed.
I saw a pic of Biden today and genuinely my brain didn’t recognize it as being him. I know he got a facelift but like,,,, why did that change his whole entire face in my head
Biden could believe God an Oreo and he’s have more faith than Trump.
I hope Biden’s team is noticing how much opposition to Kamala Harris there is..
Biden makes clear Trump wouldn't get any special favors to avoid criminal prosecution
Trump: Biden will 'hurt the Bible' and 'hurt God'
The only rationale for this mishandling of this campaign is that some polling office in quasi-DC assured the Biden people that EVERY registered democrat will show up to vote regardless of how pissed-on.  They may be right, but what a horrid lesson to learn from this moment.
Don't you staffers get tired of having to write tweets to make up for Biden's constant stupidity?
Reminder:   Elizabeth Warren is the reason Biden is open to ending the filibuster today.   She successfully pushed him left on this issue.
Joe Biden has definitely flipped his position on this issue. He was staunch against getting rid of the filibuster, now he’s open to it.   Another victory for Elizabeth Warren who helped popularize this idea during the Democratic primaries last year.

Young voters - you might not be excited by Biden. I get it. But the other option is the party that thinks you are SO STUPID you’ll vote for their distraction candidate Kanye West and feel like you made a difference. I know you’re smarter than that.
Biden won’t have any trouble with that. One shove and Donnie will be on his back like a turtle.
Biden will crush Trump in debates.
Because your mother told you that 2 wrongs don't make a right. You don't cancel racism with more racism. Besides, if Biden really believed his own words, he would have done something about it during his decades in government.
Nobody that would ever vote Democrat cares about Benghazi.   Kamala’s most memorable debate moment was when she called Joe Biden a racist. Her 2nd most memorable debate moment was when Tulsi Gabbard torched her record
“Ivanka’s $4 million haul tops the $1.7 million that Warren raised for Biden last Friday. But, in June, Warren brought in $6 million for Biden in his largest single-event to date.”  Ivanka’s $4m haul is larger than Kamala’s largest Biden fundraiser😞
Instant coffee.🙁I quit drinking "for the duration" when this mess started not realizing it was going to go on, and on. My birthday is coming up - here tell it's on the same day Biden is due to accept the nomination - and I plan to get righteously shitfaced.
If we are on the same team.. what do you want I hate Trump and everything he stands for and I fully support Biden so if you don’t support him you can leave anytime
Trump attacks Biden by saying he hates God. Trump dad was a KKK guy arrested at a pro KKK rally. The KKK hated catholics and Trump remarks are a hatred toward the catholic faith. Trump has expanded abortion like no other US President.
If Biden wins, the spring cleaning will have to be epic.
He sounds like a joe Biden with dementia,  wait
Noooo... Biden and Trump are propaganda puppets put in office to keep you from thinking about things like cancer clusters and who we gave 27 TRILLION dollars to.
So true! Biden is indeed a racist person. That is all he sees. Trump sees all of us as what our character is. Trump sees no skin color. #ColdWarRadio
Sorry to hear you will be sitting this one out. Hopefully you will reconsider if Biden's VP pick is someone you would like to see in the White House. Unfortunately progress is slow when it comes to equality and justice and while we could have done better than Joe he isn't bad.
Actually made me mad. The smirk on Biden's face and him almost flexing on you or something I didn't like that at all.
Yup. Biden will ruin this or ignore it.  um ur um where was I?
You all remember how Obama botched debate #2 in 2012, causing polls to flip, and Biden utterly obliterated Ryan soon after and singlehandedly flipped them back?
joe biden will win if he cosplays as SMT V protag
So can Biden hire, per say, Eminem to run for President to steal votes away from Trump? Asking for someone who isn’t orange.
Please do research on Biden you’d be surprised
then why wontthey run a liberal? biden literally called desegregation a racial jungle If thats not hard right, what is?
Biden is brainless now!! He should be the Poster Boy for Dementia!!!
Biden just said WHAT?!  via
As far as I know, Biden hasn’t grabbed any women by the pussy, isn’t hanging out with pedophiles, hasn’t called Latinos rapists or African Americans thugs, hasn’t fucked a porn star; can hold a bible correctly, drinks water with one hand, and is the better candidate for office.
Joe Biden is a racist.

I’m voting for Biden but I won’t donate to his campaign if he picks Harris to be his VP.  It would feel like a middle finger directed at Warren supporters who advocated for the half a dozen policies Harris doesn’t support.  Also, she’s a poor debater

If Joe Biden didn’t believe Kamala Harris was an easy target to go after from the Left or the Right, he would have announced her as his VP weeks ago.   The longer he waits=more doubts he’s having
Since when do you have access to Joe Biden?
I support bringing new people in. I would support you, if only you didn't support Trump. Biden is not who I wanted to run, but i will take him over Trump any century any day. Please reconsider, and good luck to you. I hope you get elected and make a difference
Your show is so bad. Trump sucks. Live with it. Biden 2020!!!
Biden just made a gaffe. Yes it was. But nothing compared to raging racist Donald Trump. Biden has my vote.
Trump and cronies have a hidden agenda. He is a Vatican proxy and is struggling to keep the world distracted from me. They fear me and refuse to mention me directly, and instead use proxies like Obama, Biden, etc. to keep the nation duped and distracted.
I really don’t think so, joe Biden gonna go back into hiding and trump gonna keep talking and making it worse
Yes. We would all like Joe Biden better.
You ain't black if you vote for Joe Biden
Biden's ineptness one of many reasons Trump may still be in the White House Jan. 21.
Michelle Obama might actually win imo. If Biden and Trump debate, it's over for Joe.
Probably.. Biden is at least twice as bad however.
Joe Biden.. a catholic.. will hurt God.. goddamn.
I've never seen a biden sign
Why We’re Demanding No Cops for Veep  “If Joe Biden wants to signal his commitment to the message of the Black Lives Matter movement, he shouldn’t pick a former police officer or prosecutor.” Agreed.
You need to vote for Biden no matter what
You seem to have Biden confused with Donny's golden toilet
Republican threatens to not vote for Biden unless Kamala is the VP  Why does anyone care what these losers want?    ⬇️⬇️⬇️
Biden could pick a literal dumpster fire as his V.P. and I’d still vote for him. It’s time for 45 to go.
If Biden becomes President, there'll be no HEAVEN. No HELL below us! Above us only SKY! If Biden is elected there will be no more COUNTRIES. Nothing to KILL or DIE for! And no religion too! IMAGINE IT!
I mean, Biden isn’t a gem either, but Trump has got to go, byeeeeee.
With respect, this sounds like 'I want to vote for Biden but if everything doesn't meet my specific preferences I'm willing to bail on the greater good'.
.   When you said departing the oval office I got all excited for a moment. I thought you finally figured out you'd save face by resigning instead of losing to Biden.
Taken out of context in the article which says “Biden attempted to explain that point by arguing that Latinos in Florida and Arizona had different views on immigration.” And that’s completely true. Same way East Coast and West Coast have turnpikes vs. freeways so shut up Trump.
People don't vote for VP. Seriously, they don't. If Biden's VP choice turns you off voting, you're not a serious person, no matter what your age.
rethinking my anti-Biden stance now
New polls show that Trump is narrowing the Gap with Biden. What in the hell is wrong with America that they would vote for that fool!
Let me guess, that help has to be for the Biden campaign, right?
Who let Joe Biden out of the basement and onto the airwaves unattended again?!
KHive threatening to go after Biden
“Harris memorably put her hand up when a debate moderator asked who on stage supported eliminating private insurance, which Sanders does. She later backtracked, stating to donors that she was not comfortable with parts of his plan,”  untrustworthy
if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
if Dems don't 'have the stomach' then Biden's will be a pyrrhic victory of horrendous proportions.
The 1st requirement for VP is a trust relationship w/ the President.  That doesn’t exist w/ her.  Her attack against Biden in the 1st debate proved that Harris is willing to attack other Dems. With her as VP, Biden would need someone to check his dinner for poison every evening.
Some people already know who they’re voting for and who they will NOT be voting for... and it’s not YOU. So we will get our Biden votes in early so you can start shitting your presidential pants early and make the next three months hell for you. That’s the LEAST we can do.
Maybe Mrs Obama _is_ pining for the Demos' nomination (as Mr Biden's 'issues' become too great for him to remain the candidate). Had always thought the idle spec about her and the presidency was just that.
I can't believe that someone is so stupid, but then again he said we should inject disinfectant into ourselves. He's trying to kill enough to make sure he wins in November, but if I have to walk 100 miles, I'm voting for Biden. #TrumpisaMurderer
Kamala Harris supporters:   “We will attack Joe Biden’s character if he doesn’t make Kamala Harris his VP”
Good. More reason to vote for Biden and the Democrats.
This is a weird strategy, all Biden has to do is show up and not completely shit the bed, and he beats the expectations they've set.

Historian who has accurately called every election since 1984 says Biden will beat Trump in 2020 race
You’re right. My premise a year ago was that Biden would choose Michelle but now as his mental accument is being challenged, she just may step ahead of him and with Barry’s endorsement she’ll probably make it. But with the Obama’s Gaffes the past 10 1/2 years, their done.
Imagine if someone could harness the energy of Repugs shifting after the election from their laissez faire attitude toward Donald to their hyper critical demands of President Biden.  Wouldn’t that be awesome?
Lots of people are pretty pissed about the Super Tuesday Surprise, the Biden campaign’s refusal to countenance popular left policies (legalize weed, defund cops, M4A) and the party’s embrace of Republicans. There’s not as much daylight between Biden and Trump as there should be.
lol what’s Biden supposed to answer
Biden strikes me as a full-back kinda guy, who just calls him "my lad."  So I'm going with either a fullback dive or an angle route.

Without Trump &amp; the Republicans, there’s no substantive reason to like Joe Biden. He only looks appealing relative to ghoulish republicans. Compared to a progressive Democrat, Biden seems antiquated.   Sincerely, A young person
I'm Joe Biden and I forgot my message.
You can not ignore that biden has mental issues. You can not ignore that he grooms young women and pets them and sniffs hair. Dude is wierd. Trump is trying to help people by bringing hcq treatment to light. You are right, trump and biden are not on equal footing. Biden sucks.
If Biden actually debates, then Trump will win. No doubt. Y'all better figure out how to prevent that from happening.
Joe Biden for all Americans. Not just Republicans n top 1%. It's possible with Biden
If Biden gets elected will we start offering gibberish as a language option in high school?

I have followed the belief that Michelle would run, even though she realized her husband would actually run the show. I was ignored but after looking at that publication it was obvious a real pro put it together. Biden, if he wins will resign shortly on medical necessity. Bet?
I received a tweet from Michelle Obama asking my support for her as VP for Biden. Glossy professionally done template obviously prepared and sent to ALL registered voters. I sent a snarly, yet polite ABSOLUTELY NOT! Reply to the sender, Twitter did not process it.

It was a test for cognitive impairment. Please report accurately. Biden not taking said test demonstrates no one is concerned he is suffering from dementia, unlike trump’s doctors.
Same. Biden should use it for his campaign ad.
Reminder:  Warren is the only person on Biden’s VP shortlist who has experience dealing with a national economic crisis
Thank you VP Biden!  Please also keep in mind that our system (or lack of crucial laws within our system) has given rise to the tyranny of this president. Laws must be enacted to safeguard against what we have seen from both the White House and Congress from ever happening again.
Wonder if Joe Biden understands what a fool he’s making of himself? Wonder how he feels about he’s going to replace Jimmy Carter as the biggest political buffoon in America’s history?
lol you think never-trump republicans are worth attracting to the Dem party ffs.   Also most people DID want universal healthcare but many voted for Biden instead because they were sold on the false idea that he was more electable.
You aren't being fair to Biden. He gets the white cheddar goldfish too. 😁
ffs we don't want trump, which is why we're trying to push Biden to improve his policies because we don't think he can win unless he endorses policies like Medicare For All.

Biden ran for President twice before being the VP pick in 2008, would have ran for President in 2016 but was too distraught, and did run in 2020 but folks who have presidential ambitions shouldn’t be VP picks. Oh, I get it. He falls under the white, male exemption clause.

We also no Biden has Dementia, so there's that.
Did Biden pick a vp?
This why centrists support Kamala Harris: she is an empty suit. She won’t push Biden on any issue. None
Uh no, if we’re talking about willingness to push Biden left on issues they are not equal. Harris has never pushed him on any issue. None.
I’m trying to save lives! I lost my grandparents who were both in their early 60s with no preexisting health conditions. I’ve lost enough family members to know that this virus is extremely dangerous. Biden said it best #StayHomeSaveLives

Kamala Harris has not pushed Biden left on a single issue. None.
Nope, Biden pushed Harris to the right. Her actual position on busing was the exact same one Biden holds. That didn’t come out until people asked her straight up if she supports it or not
The reason people want Warren to be Biden’s VP is because she is the least likely to become a “Yes” woman. She will shake the table and push Biden further left   Kamala Harris hasn’t pushed Biden on a single issue. None. Technically he pushed her towards the right on busing 🤡
I haven't forgotten that Trump failed to show up for at least one of the debates before the last election...i'd really like to see Biden cut Trump to shreds
Just to be clear, I DO hope Biden wins and I'm 99.99% certain he can win without my vote (apparently the DNC agrees). I also hope people won't let up one bit on the protests until real changes are achieved.  I think Joe might be a worse hawk on Syria and Iran, but... RBG.
How ever anyone interprets it, there is one paradigm that no one can successfully argue against. The program ideas of Bernie Sanders have a far better chance of getting implemented through Biden than Trump. I've worked my whole life for those ideals. I want more success b4 i go.
If playing a defensive posture means people are in the streets, I don't want that to end just because people feel vaguely better about who's in charge. I want it to continue until we actually win. I worry about false complacency under Biden. Obama ended the anti-war protests.
Biden won't standcup to Any Country, Any Corruption, For Any American, in Any Way!!! Vote Trump 2020!!!
it's so good that this is our president. and also that joe biden is basically just as cogent.
AOC is right. Biden should choose a VP who excites young voters. There’s only a handful of people on his list that do that
To the best of my knowledge, Biden is zero for 24 on the progressive policies that matter most. Most of these positions are supported by a majority of Americans overall and supermajorities of Democrats. I'm not asking for perfection, just SOMETHING.
Crazy how if you say Biden is a delusional pedophile you get slammed with “oh okay coming from a trump supporter.” Bitch no. I don’t support him either. Biden still a pedo bro😂😂
I'll give you 10 reasons to vote for joe biden and I've been and will always support Bernie. 1. Joe has integrity and is not trump 2. Joe has empathy &amp; is not trump 3. Joe has good sense &amp; is not trump 4. Joe will listen to experts &amp; is not trump 5. Joe is a strong leader..

Yes. Biden and Harris are pretty yikes but Trump is even more yikes.
Seeing the news about the NY police union endorsing Trump made me remember that the International Association of Fire Fighters has endorsed Biden.  Once again we get to see who is on the side of the community.
Joe Biden is embarrassing to even watch.
How dare you imply that we aren't doing enough by voting for Joe Biden. How dare you imply any existence of weakness within the democratic party. Jed Bartlet is turning in his grave, sir.
Democratic Socialists get off their asses and form a 3rd party? Surely you jest. You'll just snipe at Biden, Harris, Pelosi, etc. That vile social media behavior won Bernie 5 whole states in 2020. You're the kiss of death.
Joe Biden:  "wowee zowee, will you look at that! It's looneytunes!"  Elizabeth Warren: "I demand the Inspector General of the post office investigate DeJoy"  IG of the PO : "ok, I'm investigating"  One person here actually gets shit done. And sadly it's not our Pres nominee .
That’s my observation as well.  Though must I sadly report the first Biden sign in my neighborhood appeared in the last couple weeks.  There seems to (rightly) be zero enthusiasm for the guy. Seen several BLM and anti-Trump signs though.
So are you, why aren't you phonebanking for Biden right now? Every call you don't make for Biden is a call for Trump

‘S all good. It is hard to target messaging that much on what is by default a public platform, but I try to aim “criticize Biden to try to extract better talking points from him” at his supporters, and “Trump sucks, let’s get rid of him
Thank you, I think you’re very thoughtful as well. I’d like to be able to influence more non-voters toward voting for Biden / unseating Trump. I have to believe at least somewhat in what I’m saying though. I think Tlaib’s approach is a good one.
Biden’s digital team are some of the best in the business, I just cant comprehend “hire comedians to write your emails”
If Clinton showed anything it’s that promising M4A doesn’t mean you have to actually do it; it costs almost nothing to merely point out the flaws in the health insurance system. That Biden won’t even pretend he’s interested in fixing health care during a pandemic is disappointing
It took audacity for Biden to choose Harris? “The essence of audacity is having the bravery to do something that could offend others. Because of this, the word has both positive (bravery, bold) and negative (rude, impudent, disrespectful) connotations.” Go Joe! #BidenHarris2020
This is true. Which is why we have to take a hard stand. If Trump losing is more important to the Democrats than Biden winning then they can come over to our side. We tried supporting their side and it got us and them nowhere.
What will move me is Biden or his reps publicly acknowledging and apologizing for past mistakes, and communicating their new position on those issues. It’s worked well enough on Harris in the past.
Why would we expect Joe fucking Biden to roll back the clock on American fascism when he already had the goddamn opportunity with a more progressive partner than Kamala Harris.
P.s. I'm voting Down ticket  blue but am not likely voting for Biden. I don't have a dog in this fight.  But I know Soccer moms better than trump.
BTW My $5 bet says Suburbanite Soccer moms Break in the direction of Biden simply because they're concerned the  white house is xenophobic homophobic racist and a number of other forms of bigotry they'd rather not be taught to their kids.
And what did the white house do? Instead of disassembling it and putting the 90s government back together, they sent in Joe fucking Biden, who cut costs then called it a victory.
Then ask it of EVERY politician and start with Joe Biden.
It IS facing something new. I don't recall Joe Biden installing a crony corrupt postmaster general to slow down the USPS, cut overtime, sack the exec board, and scrap mail sorting machines. Each machine costs $1+ mil, so hardly a cost saving measure, ridiculous as that reason is.
The suburbanite housewife is more worried about the lessons the xenophobic clown in the white house is sending to her kids,  I know soccer moms better than trump does.  she's probably voting Biden. I don't have a problem with her. I'm actually shocked as a pretty left wing punk
The ENTIRE BIDEN FAMILY got filthy rich shamelessly using Joe's political connections. Americans are fed up.
“The ‘suburban housewife’ will be voting for me. They want safety &amp; are thrilled that I ended the long running program where low income housing would invade their neighborhood. Biden would reinstall it, in a bigger form, with Corey Booker in charge!”
Unfortunately, you’re right. There are people who can say something to sway me, but those people are Biden and Harris. I’ll be watching the debates closely, plus any press release their campaign puts out. I honestly want an excuse to be bad at leftism and vote “blue” again.
“Her agenda might not sound sufficiently ambitious in Northern California but it could very easily play differently in Michigan and Wisconsin,” Schnur said, naming two swing states narrowly clinched by Trump in 2016 but that Biden now leads in the polls.
During her unsuccessful presidential campaign, Harris attacked Biden for failing to support an overhaul of the nation’s health care system, but he slammed her for attempting to “have it every which way.” With Biden at the top of the ticket, Harris will have to move from
Harris said she was proud to join Biden and blamed Trump for mismanaging the coronavirus and the economy.  “We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be,” she said. “Joe likes to say that character is on the ballot.
If you're not chomping at the bit to vote for Biden/Harris, I don't think there's much I can say to sway you. I understand the down-ballot arg, but it pales, in my mind, in the face of this fundamental threat. ymmv
On Wednesday, Biden formally introduced Harris as his running mate in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, praising her for going after the gun lobby and oil industry and saying he wanted her “to be the last voice in the room” when he makes his toughest decisions.
Almost immediately after Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his pick for vice president, the Trump campaign and his acolytes began casting the California senator as a “far-left radical” set on transforming the U.S. into a socialist’s dream
Have we thought about how Joe Biden smells little girls because his own daughter died? Oh too far? I know lol we are all so sad.
So that gives Biden/Harris even less time than they already have to communicate a platform I’d be able to vote for. Yet another super gross and manipulative move by Trump and his goons.
worry less about biden and more about me I am the extremist and  I am prepared to vote my values for the first time.

Vote for Biden and talk to all of your reformed (almost) MAGA people. We must blow Trumpkut of the water in November. Live you
If you live in Washington state and vote for Biden, you're not participating in "harm reduction", you're just endorsing his right wing policies.
If true Biden wins in a walk, even with rigging. When non-Republicans and non-conservatives vote good things will flow.
Yes, we all have to vote for Biden this time around because we are held hostage. It doesn’t mean we have to be happy about it, or ignore that other things need to be done to fix it so we’re not held hostage next time. Don’t be so single minded you’re willing to ignore the future

Great interview. I especially appreciate his answers to questions about how a Biden presidency will help Wisconsin.
We do. I just hope Biden won’t take us down ‘Ford road’. We can’t afford that.
Don't talk to cops... Or our worthless lying mayor. Maybe stick around at a protest long enough to get gassed next time, and not just show up for the Instagram selfies. The only students that still like you at the end of the year are the proud boys &amp; Biden lovers.
I still have a hard time imagining the military would officially back a Trump coup, if only because he's been consistently personally shitty to them and Biden is a conventional warmonger. There are benefits to the status quo.  That doesn't mean the rank and file would follow tho.
If you're genuinely so terrified of trump blame yourselves for voting biden in.
I can't stand her based on all the seriously fk'd stuff she has done over the years in California but this meme made me have a good chuckle.  I guess my issues with her are similar to why I can't stand Biden due to all the crap he did while a Senator in the 1990s and early 2000s.

That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
Russians are creating fake ANTIFA web pages and linking them to Joe Biden 2020; Trump is openly trying to suppress voting; 1 out of 4 tests in Texas are positive thanks to GOP leadership; on and on—and this is on you GOPranos. You are enemies of democracy.

National organized labor works for the DNC. You think Perez/Biden/Pelosi want a general strike? No, they don’t. It has to come from the bottom up. Pick a walk-out date and spread that shit like wildfire and we’ll see what happens. Waiting for leaders is what losers do.
Bill Clinton didn’t really deliver on that, but he promised to try. Biden promises *not* to try. It’s frankly ridiculous that people keep trying to paint Biden as an FDR-like progressive when only Sanders’ platform was even close.
Yes, progressives are well aware of the back to brunch crowd, and that's one of the biggest dangers of a Biden presidency, people who hear Democrats say shit like this and don't push back.
Biden should base his campaign around being a wife guy
If China hacks Trump and sends advance notification of when the releases will be so that Biden can plan his strategy around them and he doesn't tell the DOJ so they can investigate the cyber-attack, then yes, that would be corrupt of Biden.
I said some very similar things when I took an Instagram survey for Biden. Hopefully this sort of thing gets the message through to them, that they fucked up if they wanted the progressive vote.

Joe Biden is racist and picked his vp running mate solely on her race. Again, he is showing the world he is racist.
This is an election of apathy. People are voting for Biden, because they have to, with little to no enthusiasm. This will not fare well with undecided voters. I'm walking away from Democrats this time. I haven't decided to vote for Trump. But, I won't vote for Biden.
society as we know it, you just get a possible chance to avert that eventuality in 4 years, instead of 12 with Trump rather than Biden / Harris.
So happy 4  right now - can’t wait for  to fire up this fall “Joe Biden had the audacity to choose a black woman to be his running mate - and ya know who that black woman is - itttt’s meeeeee” that was a Kamala open w/ an Oprah slide at the end.
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. We have such a short time for action on climate change before passing the point of no return.
Count me as one who will settle for Biden.

Barr should investigate Biden for creating the Wuhan virus. CNN reported Ukraine was involved. The only way to keep America great again is to make it great the first time around, reelect POTUS. #MAGA #KAGA #presidentialharrassment
uh? Joe Biden spend decades trying to defund social security.
Just like those pics conservatives are passing around with Biden consoling his grandkids at their father's funeral, and saying he's a predator?
That is why he picked  .  They are a perfect fit &amp; compliment each other.  BTW you are right behind Biden in age.  Look what you have done to our country.
We need a government that not only "listens to", but actually ACTS on science. We cannot afford to NOT have the #GreenNewDeal  Wake up Biden!
Very true, though which candidate will lead to more profitable profits is  something they very much consider.  I would expect Biden makes a good case for long game- definitely more stable than Great Orange Leader.  Stability is attractive to the insurance industry, generally.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
Send her to Shady Oaks man ... the woman is done ... all these old Dems are senile as all get out ... Schumer, Pelosi, Biden - and Schiff is just an idiot - they all think we’re stupid.  Vote for them at your own risk !
How do you know?  Obama didn’t immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
So you got to keep more of your money and you’re whining about it?  Biden said he’s eliminating the Trump cuts and will raise taxes.
The left is going to be blamed regardless if Biden loses, just accept that now, that's what is going to happen, no amount of comity or ass kissing is going to change that.  There is however a lot of leverage in saying we could have won if these voters wanted to vote for us.
Than there is in rubber stamping a right wing Biden administration.   You're just both saying a lot of demonstrably untrue fabricated bullshit that is easily debunked with some cursory research.
Let’s compare your intellect to Biden’s. First u had someone take your SAT’s, then u can barely read, often your lights are on but nobody’s home. Top psychiatrists collectively say you are a danger to yourself &amp; others. You just had a cognitive test, so do u know what this is?
Not everything that's corrupt is criminal. If Biden had done what he's accused of re: Hunter &amp; Burisma (he didn't, but still) it wouldn't have been a crime. Removing a corrupt prosecutor was in America / the West's interests.
You and jo biden need to go away.
Opinion | How Jennifer O’Malley Dillon transformed Joe Biden’s campaign Opinion by Karen Tumulty
Reason 9,000,000 I’m all I’m with Biden/Harris
Voting for Biden/Harris is jumping on the fast train to Socialism. Affordable  healthcare &amp; college for all means higher taxes for the working people. Nothing is free &amp; I know who will pay. I will be working &amp; getting less while someone else does less &amp; getting more.  #TRUMP2020
Not sure what the problem is... Chris Wallace won’t actually ask Biden a tough question
Reason enough to vote for Biden/Harris. Trump is doing worse than nothing. He is rolling back regulations.
After Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are sworn into office, we certainly will.
Lyin Biden is running on a "i am not Trump" platform no policies included....
Team Biden will.
There is no way Biden is winning short of a rigged electing.
They're only voting for Biden because they're basically comfortable...
Should the federal government require everyone to wear masks like Joe Biden wants?
He’s clearly talking about Biden. Hannity even quotes Biden a few times in that video lol poor attempt from the left
99.9 percent... The only Biden flag I've seen also had an American flag??? Head scratcher lol
Biden mostly seems to be unafraid to touch young women...
He doesn't, we just get to try again sooner than we do under Biden and Harris.
Good.  All the more reason I will be walking over broken glass if need be to vote for Biden and Harris.
VP: "Well I've got some red meat for you: We're not going to let Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris cut America's meat!"  Insert any one of a dozen jokes here that are totally obvious, probably juvenile, and yet still completely on point because…Pence.
Herman Cain's zombie Twitter account doesn't count.
NO, I am writing in Tulsi Gabbard. The DNC is corrupt and when you lose in November don't blame it on the voters, blame it on the corrupt people that control you and Biden. #NeverBidenNeverKamala #IStandWithTulsi #TulsiExposedKamala #TulsiGabbard
CNN should mention that time in 2010 when Joe Biden spoke at a Klansman’s funeral and called him a mentor and friend.
your "a new poll reinforces" is incorrect, I think- shouldn't Trump's be worse, not better? "Biden is viewed more positively than Clinton was, and Trump is viewed more positively than he was"
From the conclusion of your article.  "But Biden’s comments over time make clear that he has at least been willing to keep cuts to Social Security and Medicare as negotiating chips"
There is video of Biden proposing cuts to social security on the floor of the senate, for fucks sake.  You Blue MAGA people are just as bad as Trump, all fake news all the time, when it looks bad for your favs.  Just utterly useless Americans.
Kamala is much worse than Hillary in every aspect which is why the Biden campaign is looking like a big dummy.
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
It's disgusting how Biden shamelessly used his political connections to make himself and his entire family filthy rich.
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
As I said, I would be just fine with Trump hiring someone to speak with Ukrainians who had stories about hypothetical Biden corruption, sure.  The problem is that in this case, the "corruption" is being completely invented from whole cloth.
I didn't read that story before linking it, but if you are asserting that Obama did not try to cut social security, or that Biden has not tried to cut social security, you are lying.  Full stop.
Primary elections were held with in-person voting during a pandemic. Biden was given free corporate media coverage. Other candidates dropped out to endorse Biden just as other options had a chance. The voters did not choose Biden.
Nor will it change under Biden.
?  Trump literally can't run for two more terms, this is basic constitutional law.  And there will be no primary in 2024 if Biden wins, people pretending otherwise are lying to themselves.
Are you fact checking Biden also?🤷‍♀️
Sanders is one of the few decent people in politics, Biden and Harris certainly aren't.
If Joe Biden had corrupt business deals in Ukraine, I would be OK with Trump paying people to go talk to his business partners to learn about them, yes.   How do you not see the difference between a hostile gov't funded endeavor and private citizens?
I like Beto but come on dude! He shouldn't have endorsed Biden pre Super Tuesday, we knew they wouldn't help TX.
trump has been a hundred times more disrespectful to Biden than Harris could ever dream of being. Her calling Biden on bussing made perfect sense and I think showed him how tough and unafraid she is, which impressed him because he, unlike trump, respects women.
I will believe Biden has moved left when there is policy passed, and not a moment before.   And Favs knows that too, he just doesn't have a high opinion of his listeners intelligence.
They know since Biden’s the D ticket, their boats gonna float fine no matter who wins. Nothing special in it for any investment of time or $$
I think Vaush is realizing he is on the wrong side of the history here and is double downing on his points that Biden is the best way forward when he is obviously not.
Poll: Biden Expands Lead Over Trump; A Third Of Country Says It Won't Get Vaccinated, via
Biden said "Shoot them in the leg." The difference between that and "throw them in a van" isn't meaningfully different to those protesting police corruption.
Brinkmanship is, unfortunately, the best way I can see to advance it in 2020. I want Biden to worry about losing, not feel like he can coast on “blue no matter who” loyalists pushing everyone to give up.
Where’s Rudy G? Hiding till October to pop Hunter Biden crazy shit.
Trump being worse doesn't make Biden not a conservative, and doesn't make what you're saying anything other than apologia.

Biden is more conservative than Eisenhower. You are saying we need to vote for him anyways. That is conservative apologia.
I can respect an election. We don't always get what we want, but I would feel better, if  - Biden would have actually won the primaries without a coup  - if the pick for VP would at least have some electoral backing, for example more delegates than

This is fascinating! One thing that rankles me a/b Biden is that his style only works for and among good ole (white) boys. I love that Obama and Hillary bonded over the way the rest of us have to approach work. ♥️
I get exactly what I deserve when I’m forced to watch Biden ads whilst viewing fishing videos on YouTube
I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall. I've been making this same argument all month now but I always get the same "But Biden isn't great!". Never an answer about how letting Trump win will make things easier. They just ignore it. I hate to call people Russian bots but..
None of this is fair.  1. The interview question implies that Harris didn't like Biden. Which isn't at all what she said at the time.  2. Now she's accused of lying and not taking politics seriously. Which is obviously wrong.  "You could have done better" is critique. Not hatred.
We definitely don't have enough time for the long game of electing Biden and Harris to run the party for the next 12 years that people in this thread are advocating for.
My Mom is a Biden supporter. Myself, I aligned more with Warren/Sanders.  Whenever we talked about the election during the Primary, we knew we were voting for WHOEVER ended up running against Trump.  It's Biden and I'm voting for Biden/Harris.   It's that simple. #NeverTrump
Both didn't win the primary. Biden got in there via coup and Harris was roundly rejected.  It's amazing, how 45% of the DEM electorate doesn't appear to matter at all and sabotaging our democratic process is just fine when convenient.
Biden/Harris platform. Needs more student loan forgiveness for public servants, but also for everyone, especially first generation scholars.
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don’t need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
1. Obtained a Chinese name. 2 agreed with Biden accusers. 3. Bankrupted her own pres. Campaign.
Please keep BIDEN and all the other walking corpse predators TF away from her.  Keep at least a two corpse, head to feet of course, distance from anyone of them at any time and this 18 year woman.
Good for you.  The 25% Biden difference is unaffected as my parents are Republicans voting for Biden.
Another item on the long list of reforms needed in the Biden/Harris era. We’ve done this before and can do it again (progressive era, New Deal, post-Watergate, Church cmte, etc).
Judge Kenneth K. Lee Appointed byDonald Trump  Consuelo M. Callahan: Appointed by George W. Bush  Barbara M. G. Lynn (Voted against): Appointed by Bill Clinton  Republicans focusing on appointing judges for the last 4 years has worked. Dems better do the same if Biden wins.
Most of We the People will be voting for Joe Biden, we're tired of having a crook in the WH.
Vote Biden then call him out on his shit
I'm abstaining because I refuse to put my name forward for Kamala. I was gonna hold my nose and vote for Biden, but he fucked that wayyyy up

I have all sorts of issues with Biden, but it’s a little rich to hear critiques like this from the party of white supremacists
do you seriously think that people who voted against Hillary aren't going to vote against Biden too? I think Dems assume a way more shallow stupidity in Trump voters than is generally true. Most of them (in error, IMO, but sincerely) were voting against the broad establishment
You do realize identity theft is profitable and that voter fraud is not, don't you?  What's more likely, the people buying these IDs are running up debts .... or they are trying to vote twice because they're REALLY BIG Biden supporters?
When did politicians stop caring about rumor and innuendo??  It’s almost as if the  has just been suckering people in for 20 years with the goal of going balls to the walls now to usurp complete power. Even after Biden is in there’ll be a hellu cleanup on aisle 9. F’sheesh
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every “Trump” to “Biden” and every “Biden” to “Trump”.
Absolutely no one who voted for Trump is going to vote for Biden instead
But if we can vote in Biden he'll be able to turn that around, right? All the more reason to vote for the man.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
I aM So LeFTy, I supPorT BiDen FoR PrEsidEnt  ewwww...
Lol at the dude who thinks Biden can even remember his promises
What incentive does Biden have to back progressive policy? He has already rejected the baseline issue for us, #MedicareForAll
Pence can't pardon trump for crimes not already been indicted for and hasn't been tried for , there's a big list and it will stick .  Pence won't be anything in January , Biden will be president .
I’m starting to think ‘Bernie or Bust’ is just as ridiculous of a position as ‘Ridin’ with Biden’. Instead of placing all your hopes on one politician, you *could* examine our political system as a whole and realize it doesn’t matter who you vote for.  The electoral process..
Biden is a glass of milk. Not your first choice, but not too bad.  Trump is a glass of sewer water, bugs, and coronavirus.   The choice is YOURS.  #Biden2020 #DumpTrump
Citizens United isn’t abstract. It is concrete. Conservative Justices sided with the argument that limitless money in campaigns is free speech. Democrats want to legislate campaign finance reform &amp; Republican senate is blocking it. Want change? Vote for Biden
I will vote to elect you and Biden , and if trump became president and I lose my social security , I will fight him .
Imagine calling yourself a leftist while you bend yourself into a pretzel for Joe Biden of all people
Biden was hiding from voters well before the start of Covid.  They can only Weekend at Bernies him so many hours a day.

Biden helped write the legislation that primarily caused this system to be as fucked up as it is. I honestly don't think he would be any better or worse than Trump. If we actually want change we have to work outside of this two party corruption feedback loop
I have theory, Kamala Harris was told to drop out early to keep her from sustaining any more collateral damage during the debates,they had her as the VP pick at that point,then got Bernie out, Biden would be easy to remove giving Kamala the Presidency at some point

The new Biden/Harris campaign ad shows Joe down on one knee. Apparently Commie'la is a great teacher. Joe looks ready to perform orally.
If Biden gets the vote of postal workers, that’s gonna be clutch.
Cool , we can put you in prison for tampering with the mailing system to help you win the election ,   Don't worry , we will vote for Biden and we'll drag your ass out kicking and screaming if you don't go willingly .  Have fun in prison punk .
Biden is up 25%
At 77, Biden still rides a bicycle for exercise &amp; keeps his weight down There's no dementia there but Trump is morbidly obese &amp; can barely walk his fat behind down a ramp &amp; can't put together a coherent sentence so guess where the dementia is.
If Biden tries to come for Portland's needle exchanges ill slingshot a rig full of HIV blood into his face Muntadhar al-Zaidi style
"regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden"
Twitter is an open forum, you post things, people get to reply.   Attacking people who are clearly vastly morally superior to the Democratic party, regardless of whether or not you personally have been extorted into supporting Biden is bad form, and bad for the Overton Window.
THE ONLY TIME I will let someone vaccinate me is when I see an F.D.A. approval on the vaccine &amp; when Joe Biden is in office. FULL STOP!
Still behind in my mind.  Biden will be behind until January when he takes the oath as far as I'm concerned.
the VERY Drug warriors I've been railing against for YEARS. and now I'm just supposed to I don't know abandon everything I've ever written about and vote Biden. I stand by it all. Ergo. Howie.
Wow, you mean they’re real people? Flawed and capable of short comings? Good lord what’s the world coming to? Fascinating read. And really stoked confidence in a potential Biden administration frankly. But ya, the Obama/Biden memes weren’t real life, oh well.
It's disgusting how Biden and his entire family got filthy rich by shamelessly using his political connections.
I am learning to speak Chinese at the Hunter Biden School of Executive Mandarin.
NBA says photographer who posted offensive Kamala Harris meme is no longer in bubble. IMO the NBA did the right thing.
Joe Biden Accused Of "Enforcing Sharia Law"  Watch:    #NotMeUs
Please give us one issue on which Biden has been our ally and not a major roadblock.
..as though the only defining characteristic of blackness is how “POCs” are treated by the police. I personally have no issue in voting for Biden/Harris because I understand politics. What I do have issues with is the erasure of blackness as a defined people with a defined cause.
You can't be in America you must mean duh trump that is destroying America and great minds like biden's are not talkers they do things for our country trump only destroys so he can win plus he cheats and lies on all things
Maybe not, particularly with Biden/Harris. But Dems usually benefit from higher voter turnout (why GOP works so hard to supress votes) and who knows how many of those people were victims of The New Jim Crow
All the more reason to vote for Biden/Harris.
The thing I’m most looking forward to about the Biden Harris presidency is not being outraged constantly
But y'all were so ready to called #Harris a non-Black radical leftist fascist cop, and #Biden a sleepwalking dementia addled dithering r****t.
My wife just got notified her "good" employee sponsored insurance plan is leaving her with a $1024 bill for going to the emergency room for, long story, but basically a 2 minute visit.  F*ck Mainstream Media, F*ck Biden, F*ck Kamala, F*ck Trump &amp; F*ck the DNC
Not a peep from leftists and our mailboxes being taken out; but plenty of sh*t to say about Biden and Harris.
Trump's answer to that question is hell no he doesn't regret lying or cheating on his wife his taxes the election or Americans he's such a scumbag  can't wait till Biden and Harris win this election trump trust cheating always that's what crimminals do
Biden will drop out before or shortly after the midterms in 2022 and there will be no primary in 2024.  The Democratic party does not support primaries of incumbent Presidents, and even if there were, the last two elections should show you how hard taking down Harris will be.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
It's for these reasons That I can't bear to continue down this road and continue to vote against my own values. Biden doesn't speak for me and when I told him don't put her up he didn't even reply.
Oh, and the Biden campaign was lying about CDC recommendations until early April, it would be great if we had a candidate that actually gave a shit about science, but we don't.
We got PLAYED! Joe Biden policies are that of the same as Trump! #VoteThemOut!
Biden's "plans" are sheepherding bullshit and worth less than the electrons used to transmit them.  He probably can't even speak extemporaneously about them.
that moment in history.   We likely get someone like AOC in 2024 with Trump still in office, with a Biden Harris win we know we are getting Harris in 2024, and in 2028 assuming she wins 2024.
Also, read that article, Biden isn't in fact promising to go back to that approach, that was sarcasm, he is saying he won't get rid of the sanctions that violated our side of the terms in the Iranian deal, ie: he plans to continue Trump era foreign policy towards Iran.
I don’t think Amy threw her support behind Biden picking a WOC for pats on the head.
Joe Biden also sucks shit,so no
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
If Biden gets elected quarantine is legally over for 48 hours. Catch me in a sleeping bag at Bar Bar
i'm sure you've been ratio'd on this but you mean the cages biden and obama built and the scotus that biden personally enabled while humiliating anita hill?  you all let the left go in 2016 as well.
Trump is looking for any excuse not to debate Biden, so....... perhaps not the best negotiating device. Trump knows how poorly he'll do; how stupid he comes across (cuz he IS).
Good thing Biden is going back to that approach to Iran.
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Stamp of approval:
I’ll take this another step: Leftists shouldn’t see Biden’s victory as a ‘good thing’ for our movement.  He and Trump both have already wrought havoc on society, oppressing and attacking anyone who refuses to bend to the will of the State.  At this point, electoralism is dead..
Idk who need to hear this bu Biden isn't going to follow through on his climate change plan.. Joe Biden is the same candidate that promised to cure cancer if he was elected but said Sander's (not so radical) plan to address climate change wouldn't ever work.
And we already know that Biden supports regime change in Venezuela, a goal of the oil industry and the oil industry alone, and that he has no intentions of doing anything about fracking.
"that’s a whole lot of accelerated global warming tracing right back to America’s front door."  Now there's perhaps a debate to be had about whether or not this was intentional, and purely on the optics Biden and Obama were and are superior.  But all that really matters is tons
Don't mess with our USPS!!! Vote BIDEN/HARRIS... &lt;3 Postal workers union endorses Biden, warns 'survival' of USPS at stake  via
Obama, Biden, and HRC, literally sold the world fracking technology.
Nah. Biden for me.

Usually I want October to go by as slowly as possible to savor every moment of the most wonderful time of the year, but now November simply cannot come soon enough.  Can't wait to cast my vote for Biden/Harris!
I don't know how much more clear it can be that everyone needs to vote FOR Biden-Harris, *and* get ready to mobilize in any way possible to get this guy out of office. He is incredibly dangerous.
Trump is objectively awful on the environment, no argument from me, but so is Biden, so again the only relevant question is when do you get to do something about it.  4 years is 4 years less than 8 and 8 years less than 12.
Trump still hasn't done as much damage to the environment as Obama and Biden did, mostly because Trump can't do the things they already did, like turning the US into the largest oil producer on the planet.
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THIS LIST WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION! Is your head up your ass for the warmth?? "Nothing will fundamentally change" they are the fucking same. Just screwing the worker and making the rich richer. God liberals are the worst
Of course it does and this is yet another item to repair once we flip the Senate as well as elect Biden.  If we're don't flip the Senate it'll be trouble.  So many wrongs and things to codify in laws.
Almost optimistic compared to my theory, they felt no responsibility to participate in the democratic process at all, and many who did voted Biden because it's the name they'd heard before. 😐
Looks like Joe Biden is sniffing her. Can't wait for the convention.
But they say electing Biden would turn the US into a banana republic.   EVERY ACCUSATION IS AN ADMISSION WITH THESE BUFFOONS
Neither presidency is going to address climate change, which means the only relevant question for our young people's future is when do you get the next earliest chance to address climate change, with Trump it's 4 years, with Biden and Harris it's probably more than 12.
"WE ARE NOT GONNA LET JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS BEAT...OUR....MEAT!!!" (from stage right) "Sir! reduce! reee-duuuuce our meat!"
I sincerely love to see people online be like, “I don’t love Biden/Harris either but I’m voting strategically!” and the strategy is to capitulate with no demands, leverage, or resolve. 4D chess; very inspiring
you were a Yang supporter...he was not a socialist, that is more like Biden/Harris...confusing to me...You really aren't sure what you want or believe..but the BS talking points are so hollow. You had this country, move..why not be more happy instead of so bitter?
It's sooooo touching that Trump cares so much about how Joe Biden is treated well or not.
What are the plans for the future of the GOP? The POTUS can’t even answer that from his favorite newscast. What a TOTAL LET DOWN! Biden/Harris for 20/20! Save our democracy!
Not implying obviously that Harris is an “evil” at all, but the article also ignores that Biden has been the presumptive nominee for a while and progressives have had time to adjust. Few seriously believed Biden would choose someone from the far left.
I'm curious how man missed social security checks will swing a senior from trump to biden
Get used to fighting. We will never not need to.  Trump wins? We'll have to fight every day. Trump loses? We'll have to fight every day. Forces have been coalescing to derail a Biden term.  We are never going back to the normal that some people still think we are operating in.
I'm pretty sure at least 633,108 people will vote for Biden and Harris this November.  #USPS
“We can hold them accountable” is what the dems say. What this actually translates to is “shut the fuck up, vote for our guy” as Biden said at the outset of this campaign: “nothing will fundamentally change”
Biden and Kamala: King and Queen of Mass incarceration.
You blocked Obama from putting oversight in at the post office for political reasons, after helping russia to help trump get electioned. Your brainwashed followers still believe lies about Democrats, Hillary, Biden, and Kamala and you have never denounced those lies
No. It takes an immense amount of cognitive dissonance to look at Trump then look at Biden and be like “eh theyre pretty much the same”
We need to get back to being the party of the new deal and STOP CRIMINALIZING POVERTY amongst other things. OH and if you are a Woman shocked and horrified that this Feminist activist won't support Biden well just keep in mind that Clintons Welfare reform destroyed the very
realize that without those who voted for him in 2016, who have admitted their mistakes and who will now vote with us for Biden are worthy of our forgiveness and our appreciation for admitting the mistake and wanting to rectify it we may not win this one. It’s also time for us to
So there's a chance we'll have two presidents back-to-back inspired at least in part by spite to show they can do better than Obama did?  Cool cool cool cool cool...
Vote Biden.  You won’t be as sorry as I hope you are now for voting for Trump.
if you're campaigning for the hearts and minds of older people who essentially think the republican parties ideas and agendas are just swell and they're morally upstanding then you'd use the Tactics Biden's using. But I'd rather lose than go with that shit.
Ironically, I support your POV at the federal level where I will hold my nose and vote for Biden. In PDX the mayor is merely a vote so yeah I’ll assume the posture of the loyal opposition. Vigor.
If everyone votes blue and the Biden loses, the DNC can only think to go after GOP voters. That mean even more right leaning "left" candidates. THAT'S BAD CHANGE.   You only shift the overton window by pulling from the left.
I will definitely get vaccinated, but not with some Trumpian fly-by-night debacle. If they have one developed after Biden has been inaugurated...
Tuliscrats &amp; YangGang = Howlers DNC and GOP = The Society's Gold Houses Trump, Pence, Biden, Harris = Pixies
If Biden loses and the DNC see it as a failure to listen to the people who voted third party and next time they cater to them? THATS GOOD CHANGE. If enough vote third and the GOP &amp; DNC  lose power? THATS GOOD CHANGE.
Why would they support Joe Biden?
wait till you find out Biden was vp for 8 years and still let shit like joe arpaio's tent camp exist. don't worry about the ICE centers tho: you might get so angry you start calling for for the Kristallnacht
There is something that is very irritating about Kamala Harris. I don't think she will help Biden at all.
PENCE: The selection of California liberal Senator Kamala Harris as Joe Biden&amp;#039;s running mate simply confirms everything President Trump and I have been saying about Joe Biden and the Democratic Party.
There's Nothing more Pathetic than your Comment! Lemme guess, Voting for Biden is the way to go? Sorry, I want my rights left alone thank you
Third, Green and Bernie votes aren't siphoned Biden votes or anything. They're people who value different things and aren't being catered to by Biden or Trump. They aren't jerks, they're a statistic of how much your candidate failed.
This is wrong on so many levels. First, your vote doesn't matter in the way you think due to the electoral college. Second, Oregon is gonna be Biden, it doesn't matter how many more Biden votes there are than Trump ones, just that there are more.
First off, own what you did, and you have. Realize your choice is Trump or not trump rather than trump vs biden.
People aren't organizing a General Strike to help Biden, they're organizing one as an indictment of the entire system, letting the Democratic party co opt this idea is a terrible idea.

More spicy hot takes cuz I've seen this all over a lot of people I know's various profiles.   If someone doesn't vote for Biden, they aren't voting for Trump (well besides the ones that explicitly voted Trump but that's besides the point). Stop guilting people for it.
As evil as this bitch and Biden white ass is imma still vote for them smfh
Didn’t vote for Biden not supporting Biden! Period!
How many times.. That's Harris - Biden. Honestly, you might get people confused.
What isn't it. I agree with Cornel that she can't be trusted &amp; we have to be honest about her &amp; Biden even if they get our vote
Again, I don't think they're perfect, I'm not even a registered Green, I do think there is a lot more value in showing there is a block of voters that reject Blue No Matter Who than running up Biden's popular vote score for no reason.  If you get them to 5% they get federal
Biden please. I did the same thing
Reporters trying to get clickbait, goading on all things Biden said. WHPC is a joke.
LOL, you're tweet was just immediately retweeted by a settle for Biden account.
F.... Joe Biden,  he can wear a mask, but I'm NOT changing religions.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
Joe Biden in a nutshell
Not me! I was with Kamala from the start and when she dropped out I went to Biden. Seeing these two atop the ticket has had me celebrating and spending swag money like crazy! #BidenHarris2020
Most ballot access:   Environment:   Justice:   Protest Vote (Write ins):      I can't vote for people to lie to my face (This is a post in reply to Biden "defending" SS)
K Harris was not Born in the USA, according to what i learned in school she can not become President if Biden dies or becomes more senile, then the Speaker of the House becomes president
She denied hundreds of early releases to low level drug offenders because it would take away cheap (slavery) labor from California prisons—in fact, when Biden declared her VP, stocks in prisons went up!
I'm progressive. Biden and Harris are closet republicans.
I would take position in Joe Biden's White House. Most the time anyone would.Trump the only one i know that never filled his cabinet.Or had to put out ads to fill it.
This plus an earlier NYT article indicate Obama and team failed to really see who Biden is and his strengths, focused too much on superficial faults.  Leading of course to the world-historical disaster of picking HRC as 2016 nominee.
But just to be on the same page... Not voting for Trump, should not mean voting for Biden.  Right?  #NeverBiden #NeverTrump   #VoteJo
The other day  was going to the Biden campaign and vis versa!
But like my dad says, you can't put the shit back in the goose. I'm way too lazy to go through an unfollow them all. So if you could kindly just block me, I only care about anarchist and other far-left content, I'd rather eat shit than vote Biden.  That's all
Listen. If you're a dem or a blue wave or k hive or Biden lover, unfollow me. If I followed you first, honestly a couple years ago I took a bunch of adderal, set up this Twitter, and followed like a thousand democrat and environmentalist accounts. I regret every bit of it,
Video's and recordings to release under my sworn oath to the people of Oregon.  Will Biden or Trump save my family from corruption?  Hell no there not. Why not you both talk about our laws and freedom? Right! Here is a whistleblower &amp; witness with video and 20 full tapes of this
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... naïve.
When did Biden say that? Do you have a link?
I'm a truck driver, white male. And I'm Biden all the way
so when she called out Biden on his segregationist past and retracted it as a JK moment that was change too right? i know it was an eternity ago (june) so records might be spotty.
Not ALL who voted for trump in 2016 are members of his cult. The cult loves him because he hates who they hate (people of color, liberals, strong women...). There is his cult and then there are people who were conned who we need to embrace because they will vote for Biden/Harris.

A Shapiroesque surrogate comes in and says “look at all the outspoken radical leftists voting for Biden though, doesn’t that prove he’s a commie?”.  Maybe the vote can be printed out with the following diagram:
I wish #Biden would have chose #StaceyAbrams instead. She's 10000% better than Kamala who is a cop #ACAB who put 1500 people in prison on petty cannabis charges. I'm only voting for #BidenHarris2020 because anything is better than trump. I would love to vote for Stacey!
Here is the text from this mornings campaign email:  "Kamala Harris is the meanest, most horrible, most disrespectful, MOST LIBERAL of anyone in the U.S. Senate, and I cannot believe that Joe Biden would pick her as his running mate."
That’s why, even with pandemic unemployment etc, I’m still worried about Biden/Harris. They’re selling “return to normal” but has that “normal” been lost forever? It’s like trying to set a wet log on fire.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Rose emojis for Biden
In this house, we are whites with college degrees, Biden 100%
Biden has supported tough-on-crime policies for his entire political career. As a prosecutor, Harris enforced them.
It’s ok to hate him, and still vote for him. It’s people who vote for Biden out of spite that puzzle me.
Driving around Oregon you don't see much, if any Biden stuff. Plenty of Bernie, Hillary and Obama things still around though. I saw a UN flag in front of the house the other day and just shook my head in disbelief.
“Hi, i’m white. My life under Bernie, Biden, Trump, Mccain, Obama, Ben Carson and that cowboy guy that tried to run would be the same. But i refuse to vote for Biden because my principles tho. Kids in cages thats fine.” (There are bipocs that buy into the narrative too)
So the millions that lost their homes under Obama and Biden got chicken?   Blue checkmarks have lost the script.
Are you a doctor? Biden was VP,His job was to work with Obama. It was Obama not Biden call. Obama follow the doctor advice,Trump did not. Not all sickness are the same.This one getting worse as it evolves. It spread faster and not has hard to get now. It has gotten more deadly.
Respect your point but I'm not a fan of "earn my vote" logic because: There is no version of biden/Harris that would not be infinitely better than trump. We need him out and they are the ONLY current solution to that problem.
Right! Every minute you don't spend phone banking for Biden, you're phone banking for Trump!
I think a Biden admin would be fundamentally better for DEMOCRACY, for global alliances, for everyone. If you are having trouble reading tea leaves, read ON TYRANNY by Tim Snyder. 128 pgs that lays bare the direction which re-election would take us.
If Biden wins, you can kiss it all goodbye. I'm not expecting much, anyway. 🙄
Nine out of 10 Democrats support Kamala. The Biden campaign raised $48 million in two days since her announcement. People are ready to win. Twitter is a bubble. Get real.
Feeling despair. Even though Trump is slowing down the mail to interfere, can Biden still win this election?
Me too😜
Help keep Social Security and make it stronger Mr Biden!
Help Social Security Mr Biden!
And after SC, Biden was never on the ropes against Sanders or Warren, etc.
In 2012, Dems could argue that Romney had shifted positions and become more “severely conservative” to win primary. But Biden never really catered to the left.

Too many people are just voting for "not Trump"   Biden could say he's pro holocaust and a vast majority of his supporters would support him over Trump
Clarify for me: So you won’t demonize a fellow catholic. But will happily demonize Joe Biden and all the democrats for being pro-choice?  Is that correct?
classic toxic cis white male exceptionalism.  folks, you really do hate to see it.  only way to offset this is by voting for **checks notes** joseph robinette biden jr this november
Here's the scenario... community with 250,000 voters. Score is tied. Trump has 100K, Biden has 100K. 50K have decided to stay home or vote 3rd party. Those 50K would never vote for Trump, but if they would/could find their way to vote for Biden? Game over.
They can’t arrest him, they don’t have anything. The person who needs to be arrested is Biden‘s opponent

I think despite all the nonsense, the vote will end up in favor of Biden, but they will have created a legitimate claim to challenge, because they control the process. Even if we make it through the election, I think That will activate QAnon terrorists. Frightening territory.

Interesting, as I thought that was a liability. Biden needed a significantly younger VP to balance the ticket and one who could conceivably be the frontrunner in 2028 or sooner in a worst case scenario.
TX would be a huge win if it went blue. ALL Texas Electoral Votes would go to the blue side (Biden Harris).

Well, if you’re OK with another four years of not liking Trump, just stay at home and don’t vote for Biden. Really dumb question actually.
Interesting... I didn’t claim anything counter to your three statements. Reread mine. Bottom line: anyone who doesn’t vote Biden/Harris makes it more likely that Trump’s stable base of support is enough to give him four more years. That is simple math.

I don't either, the difference between us is I don't think Biden does either, but thanks for not entering the conversation bashing me assuming I'm a Trump fan, that's rare these days :)
This isn’t about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
Yep!  Biden is now a puppet.  Harris will immediately use the 25th Amendment and declare Biden incompetent.  She will take over via cheating which is exactly what the Far Left does.  Liars, Leakers, Lawbreakers and full blown lunatics galore.
Democrats, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, once again  John Katschit isn't bringing votes to the Biden/Harris ticket, but his presence will discourage 1000s of young progressives from voting  Why support a party that ranks republicans above its own progressive base

Interesting take: Biden’s civility &amp; humanity show weakness, whereas the constant lying, misogyny &amp; racism coming out of trump’s mouth are considered strength. Only the GOP could come up with this twisted logic.

Those alternatives are likely to be far right populism. We got trump because Obama didn't do shit for working people. We'll get someone worse than trump after Biden.
If Biden wins he will serve big business and he won't do a thing about the worsening economic inequality. He will fail to ameliorate the problems that the working class face, and more and more people will become disillusioned with the democratic party and seek out alternatives.
But we gotta vote for Biden because of how important the Supreme Court is
I think in some respects just letting the   know i'm still undecided has the  effect of pressuring the party into coughing up more... We're still a few months out. usually by this stage i'd know but Biden  enraged me by nominating Kamala.
It does not serve progressives to just commit your vote to Biden/Kamala 90 days before the election. At least try to sweat them a little bit. No drone bombings. M4A. No 3.8b to Israeli apartheid machine. Now’s the time to make demands. Art of Deal, you know.
I've been confused really about what i'm going to do. I mean biden's climate agenda is pretty compelling.  It's just that I do want more.
There is no left party in the US. There is no party that even represents left interests in the US. Thus, we can not win any elections where actual leftists are not among the candidates. If Donald Trump wins, we lose. And if Biden wins, *we lose*.
Good luck getting your BlueMAGA racist Biden elected with this voter outreach. Maybe you should do some phonebanking for him.
People keep saying that leftists who don't vote for Biden are just concerned with politics as an aesthetic and don't actually want to win. What those people don't seem to understand is that we can not win this election. Joe Biden is not *us*. The Democratic Party is not our party
Learned about this flawed but profound analogy for the election  Cops shoot to kill. Biden suggested cops should shot people in the leg (we’ll get to him later)  When you vote think of it this way: Would you rather get shot in the heart or the leg and get the chance to recover?
The current schedule says Buttigieg is one of several speakers between 9 and 11 but that Biden is supposed to speak starting at 10pm... so I think everyone will just get a few minutes each before Biden comes on.
listen man I live in the bluest fucking state I could vote for a walnut and it would go to Biden. Go bother someone who doesn't care about sexual assault and lives in Georgia or something
A Fox News commentator said it was “shameful” that Joe Biden is politicizing COVID by criticizing Trump’s response to the pandemic. This is wrong on many levels, but someone needs to explain how silencing gov scientists is not political.
would you tell Tara Reade to vote for Biden?
Suppose Biden-Kamala was not your first choice but Trump poses such a threat that you are willing to vote blue anywho. Shouldn’t you at least pretend to withhold your vote in exchange for M4A and prison abolition? It’s 90 days to the election.
Absolute must read on the VP selection process, Biden’s past is now prologue for Harris. Such a brilliant piece of writing and journalism from
Apparently Biden is healthier than Trump too, Biden, at 77, still rides a bike &amp; keeps his weight down, Trump is morbidly obese &amp; can barely walk down a ramp.without nearly falling.
“Because my candidate wasn’t picked, I can’t in good conscience vote for Biden”  But 1000s are dying every day.  “My conscience is A-OK with that.”
I see you have been drinking the lies of the left and the Kool-aid they offer.  So sad.  Time to send the lying Demorats packing in November.  That way we can keep our Republic out of the hands of the Marxist left.  Down with the woman/child sniffing Biden.
Notice  body language while  talks. Arms crossed and legs folded the whole time he is talking. Closed body. HUGE blues clue!!
This man was wrongfully convicted as a result of a reckless and immoral prosecution by Kamala Harris and her colleagues. He says it’s hard but we have to vote Biden/Harris. Getting rid of Trump is too important.
He still puffs , just only after he huffs..and blows  Biden alter down
Biden is much smarter than Trump, Trump can't even put a coherent sentence together &amp; he's so narcissistic he makes everything about him in some way, he's totally lacking the ability to feel sympathy for anyone.
Biden is not in charge of anything yet. You must be talking about Donald.
Leftists will be leaving the democratic party in unprecedented numbers long before Biden even has a chance to change their minds. We all know that he's the epitome of what is wrong with this unfixable party and will never forgive them for the forced choice of Trump or Biden
Biden is a fucking moron
Vote Biden. At least he is a decent human being. Far more than can be said about trump!
via     TRUMP IS A RUSSIAN STOOGE, A COWARD, AND A LYING SLOB
But don't worry guys- biden will definitely not make those kind of mistakes! No way! He's way smarter and more aggressive than Obama! Remember, you Have No Choice ☺🌊
Joe Biden, join No More Freeways
Yep, they are threefold liars (1) they promoted the lie based falsehood of the Russia collision,(2) lie by omission in not being journalists in covering Biden’s obvious mental decline and many past issues, &amp; (3) squelching free speech under the guise of fact checking.
People on the left are just getting dumber and dumber. They go by ooh  look at what my friends are tweeing so I'll do the same.   AOC endorsed Bernie. DNC and Biden campaign might be offended.   Everyone there is singing to the choir. Won't be watching the shit show

I wonder, does Biden ever think "Hey, what I said was really ridiculous.  I better be more careful."
You must VOTE BLUE.  We're voting to get trump OUT OF OFFICE!  You might not like Biden but he's a hell of a lot better than Trump.  The Dems have a large &amp; winning team.  Warren, Kobacher, Swalwell, Rice &amp; many others to fill the positions now held by pro-trump sycophants.
I'm really starting to think that a lot of these "leftists" that I'm suddenly seeing who are 100% NeverBiden aren't being very honest about their intentions. Biden sucks, but things will be a lot easier to fix with him in charge than Trump. They never have an answer for that.
Trump has had a remarkably stable base of support since his election. The question is how many of the rest will vote for Biden/Harris. Votes for Kanye or Green Party reduce the possibility of defeating Trump. It’s simple math.
82 days to win🎉  🇺🇸Biden Harris 2020🇺🇸
Joe Biden will hurt Meat! And God! And Harley Davidson’s! And Cheese!
I don't think much will change under Biden -- except they'll remove the hard(-ish) 2024 date and boost Earth observation programs. The Dem's draft platform emphasizes program continuity. I bet they keep Bridenstein on, actually.
I have to assume that’s rooted in how well Biden is polling in Florida relative to other swing states &amp; not about the fundamentals of the election.
Biden has already said if he wins presidency he won’t be running for a 2nd term. I know we want dems to hurt for the loss of Bernie but at this point Biden is better than Trump. We can use the next 4 years to focus on getting more left leaning politicians into congress &amp; senate
getting biden-pilled 😎
Blows my mind when I see that Biden is up by eight points only and that 45% of the people still are going to vote for the Orange racist bastard.  What is wrong with those people?
So trump is now using the name Biden?
Vote for Biden, lower your expectations, and start listening to POC.
He can’t Call for anything. Biden climbed out basement for this?
Biden said that masks should be mandatory for everyone to wear when outside for 3 months! 😠
Congress went on vacation because they are 100% confident that Trump/Biden loyalists will do the dirty work of fighting the poor people who are calling for a #GeneralStrike.   Let’s prove them wrong.
Biden would never use that word...it would lead to questions about his fetishes
In Oregon, we can “mail” ballots at libraries/other drop boxes.    We just did it the other day for a special election (PDX city council).   We’re not going to put ballots into a mailbox.    If I didn’t live in a state with 100% mail voting I would walk thru fire to vote Biden.
Biden is disgusting.
I’d vote for Kanye b4 Trump but I am I am super hopeful about Biden’s pick.  They just might make a great team and pave the way to get out of this mess.  👍🏽
I have my problems with Biden but If you are looking at this race and Biden is the one that worries “religious voters,” they have seriously lost the plot.
But do you "cut America's meat" or is that just Trump.  Whatever the hell "cut America's meat" means.  Also would Biden and Harris at least be able to cut vegan meat alternatives for those of us who don't eat the real thing?  Inquiring minds want to know.
I voting howie2020 as well. I’d never connnect myself to trump or Biden on paper. Makes me sick thinking of it. I live in a blue state it doesn’t matter anyway. Only helps the Green Party.
U idiots call anything Russian that you disagree with. It’s sad. Trump at least radicalizes the left Biden will do just as Obama. Beg progressives for a boost then hire a cabinet of bankers and bomb the Middle East.
just hearing his voice raises my blood pressure! i hope i never hear it again after 20 January 2021!! BIDEN/HARRIS (Buy stamps online; help fund our USPS:
Joe Biden said I’m not really black unless I vote for him.
He's very limited in his thinking..... lol .... who's next?  Biden?
Maybe Russia will steal his and photocopy millions and all will vote for Biden
Trump and Barr are openly stating their game plan, but no one is listening. They plan to have Obama, Biden, and many others arrested for the phony "crime of the century", then move to steal the election, or ignore it. Trump has only loyalists in the top positions. Marshall Law.
I know but maybe Biden will be less favorable than Obama, his approval ratings really help him being able to push Biden through. Plus Biden would be 2nd VP to serve after their president. Bush and Reagan being the only other one.
Am I the only one who, the minute Kamala Harris dropped out of the primary, knew she’d be Biden’s running mate? Like, they made a deal then, right? She didn’t need to drop out when she did.
Well, that didn't take long!  Trump accuses Kamala Harris of not being born in the U.S.A..    From the NYT:
Wonder if she’ll fulfill her campaign promise to Biden in the Lincoln Bedroom?
Ok, I will vote for Joe Biden is everyone just shuts up and stops shaming me for not being excited about Joe Biden. Deal?
A lot of the bizarre &amp; demented things Biden says make me think of #DuplexPlanet #DavidGreenberger
They are afraid that if she speaks she will take votes away from Biden and Harris. Which she would in a heart beat. #NeverBiden #NeverKamala #IStandWithTulsi
I can’t think of anything Barr could conjure up, real or imagined, that would change my vote for Biden.
Win the Senate, win the House, win the Presidency, pass voter reform, pass national vote by mail, work hard to remove the hate. We all have work to do, and a Biden win doesn’t mean our work is done, it means our work is beginning.
Me voting for Biden/Harris in November.... lol #why #smh #Election2020 #fuck #lmafo
We can’t make stuff better overnight. It’s not going to happen with how fucked everything is. But we can start building it back little by little so that every jump to the left isn’t such a shift. Biden buys time for AOC and the other progressives to do their thing.
This tweet is a microcosm of my point. It's possible to be anti Trump, but want better than Biden. Perpetuating narrative that we have to toe party line because he's the lesser of 2 evils props up existing power structures that have always been bad for everyone but the white 1%
It’s common sense that if Biden/Harris want people like me to vote for them, they need to put forward a platform I can vote for.
Activists are not a monolith. And the vast majority of the activists I know in Portland and the ones I follow on social media have made it clear they want nothing to do with Biden and the Top Cop.
No to Biden and Kamaunissum
Let's not forget Biden had draft deferments as well. He was eventually exempted because of asthma. But that didn't seem to keep him from playing halfback and defensive end in college.

You should consider that I don’t want to vote for Biden’s platform the way it is right now, so if he won’t change his platform he either does not know that there are constituents who feel this way or he does not want my vote.
Congress is on vacation while millions are  out of work and an eviction crisis is looming. At the same time, people are pretending Biden’s policy proposals matter. What else do they have to do before people understand they don’t care about us.
Moderates are the enemy of progress. Don't get me wrong. Biden is exponentially better than Trump, but the idea that that's our only option is an illusion to keep the status quo.
It was too late for electoralism *at least* twenty years ago, the bill for supporting a worthless fake opposition party is past due, vote for fucking Biden if you feel like it but it will do absolutely zero good and if you don't believe me now, fucking wait and see
Can't get behind this. 4 years of Biden destroying the climate when we are already at the breaking point. 4 years of growing income inequality and no universal healthcare. We could've had real progressive nominees who would do something about these issues.
Thank you Joe Biden for making your hats in the US. Unlike the slob in the White House who pays China to make his inferior items.
Using that same logic, a vote for third party is a vote for Trump. A vote for third party is a vote for Biden. As a #VoteGreen’r, my argument is... a vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteGreen
HAWORTH: Biden, Kamala Ignore Obama-Biden Administration’s Own Findings On Brown To Push Agenda

Biden doesn't need the people who would support this mandate in order to win. He needs the people he's pissing off. It's the margins on the right that keep stealing the Dem presidencies-Biden and Harris demand a nationwide mask mandate until November

Joe Biden Tries to Take Credit for Trump Brokered Peace Deal as Rashida Tlaib Yells At Clouds
You should be asking that question of Schiff,  Pelosi, and Schumer. How about Biden and Harris too? Massive amount of lies have been spoken by them and these lies can be backed up by documentation. Trump may exaggerate some but those are not outright lies like the others tell.
“Women and Jews! Biden’s downfall!”
Don’t make this a Trump vs Biden debate. You’re being played and manipulated. Don’t you see that? I don’t care if we agree on anything else but one thing; If we sacrifice our freedoms, then all those who died for us to have them, died in vain.

Politico is not a valid source. We have to fact check them constantly. Link to where Biden himself said this or where it is on his website.
An alternative slogan for Biden/Harris “Beat the Meat!”
I hope that is reconsidered under new leadership. Maybe Biden and Harris having both been senators? Likely a Pollyanna perspective...
Here's a few things that might put just how awful a Biden presidency is going to be into perspective.
Should we be embarrassed by good job numbers?   You hated Trump when we had the best economy in the world. You hated Trump before the virus.   You hate him but you don't know why.  You support Biden but you don't know why.   You can't answer any of this as liberals have NOTHING.
Can anyone prove that Biden didn’t pick his VP by doing a blindfold smell test of locks of hair?
If you don't live in a swing state, and you are planning on voting for Biden you legitimately have not thought that long about politics, and or don't care about things like Medicare For All.   That's harsh, but it's a harsh truth that needs to be told.
I’ve been involuntarily receiving Trump campaign emails and I’ve noticed that they are 100% negative and fear mongering. No “you should vote for us bc we are great and will do x!” But all “The Dems/Biden/Harris are evil! Vote against them!” And they spam 6+ emails a day.

Cool! In a few years when the Left in the U.S. is strong enough for libs like Biden &amp; Harris to stop slapping us around &amp; offer us a bone he can start working on the relationships &amp; understanding he’ll need to form productive coalitions at that point!
She should thank Biden for his years of fucking America for his own benefit.
I say, Joe Biden is not my Boss. I do what I want!!
The mistake in 2016 was giving the left the finger in the hopes that Republicans would vote for Clinton, which was insane, it might not be less insane in 2020 given Biden is basically a Republican, but it shouldn't be something you're supporting if you identify with the left.

I’d love to know which choice you think could win the election that is happening in less than 3 months.   Even Bernie will vote for Biden...
Which house?  He has at least four!  Chicago, Hawaii, DC, and Martha’s Vinyard.  All worth millions of dollars.  I laughed at people who thought  was going to give up that life to be Biden’s VP.  There’s no way she wants the presidency, either.  They’re rich!!
Unlike Biden he’s said that he’s regretted the ultimate result of that vote and he’s spent part of his career fighting to fix his mistake. Biden was proud that it led to the creation of the patriot Act, which again Bernie has been very much against.
First pic I’ve seen of Biden wearing a mask tho 🤔
Guess what? Michael Cohen’s book is dropping &amp; Trump is freaking out because it will end his campaign no matter what he or his sycophants make up about Biden or Harris.
Biden Obama joint arm was twisted for this courtesy towards Yang.

a cynical person might think that the Harris was chosen specifically to court this sort of nonsense as a means to take the heat of of Joe Biden's... interesting public outreach.

Joe Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
Has Biden ever gone after and tried (at least) to repeal a law because he felt it was too reactionary/conservative? Just thinking about if he wins, what might he try to undo that Trump has implemented? I really don’t see it happening.

I believe it's actually Joe Biden and Kamala Harris responsible for cutting America's meat

In 2016, I liked Hillary and was glad to vote for her, but in truth, I was voting against Donald Trump. Keeping him from office motivated me to vote for the first time.  But now I feel like I really am voting FOR someone. Biden and Harris are amazing leaders. I can't wait!
Wall Street loves a Biden/Harris White House
I googled Ghislaine Maxwell and the top two “People also search for” are Jeffery Epstein and Joe Biden.
have you seen the Stock market today? Going up, Wall Street loves a Biden/Harris White House
She also publicly stated that she believed Biden’s accusers. How could anybody who’s been a victim of sexual abuse support her?
Dear Tucker, I am glad to say for once I agree with you! You said if Biden elected everything Trump accomplished would be undone! I am looking forward to that reversal! Let us rejoice in that shall we! The hateful policies will be undone! Dancing in the streets!
Rudy Giuliani’s daughter announces her support for Biden/Harris  (I predict there will be a lot like this. Young people are ready to move forward.)
You can hate Biden and Kamala all you want you're justified in that. Just don't complain and be mad when not only are we stuck with a bad president and VP, but also a regressive agenda and a conservative run Supreme Court. Way to send a message to the Democratic establishment.

Democrats Ply Biden With Alternatives to Harris for Running Mate
Let's talk about the Biden Harris campaign and what it means for us....  via   Bring Decency into the World
I do not like her previous record on strengthening the 3 strikes law in CA, or mandatory minimums. That said- Biden/Harris still have my vote. We cannot endure another Trump term under ANY circumstances. No matter how "bad" we think she is Trump is miles worse.
Biden and Kamala,  Running with a creepy fella
#Black #womanchallenge  Joe Biden. What is a hashtag. I do not know what year is current.
My point was never that Trump is better than Biden. I simply don’t like getting vote shamed and called privileged for having well-researched political and moral objections to voting for a guy who has contributed a great deal to why we are in the situation we are in.
Biden will weaken the progressive movement because establishment Dems like Biden, Schumer, Pelosi, etc. are the ones pushing harder than anyone to quell opposition to the status quo. Biden himself admitted nothing will fundamentally change for the ruling class. Progress undone.
The same people that argue that Pence is potentially worse than Trump “because he’s principled” are now in full support of Biden, a principled hardline conservative
I respect that you aren’t trying to sell Biden as a good candidate. He simply isn’t. However, I think that rather than blaming voters for not being compelled to vote for someone that doesn’t espouse any policies they support, we should instead address why that’s the case at all
80% of Black Americans think Trump is a racist. Today Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his VP. You are as out of touch as Trump. Please tell us more about your QAnon beliefs Jo Rae? Your campaign is DOA. More nutters for Trump.
Not trying to be rude, but how will Biden be functionally different? On paper, he opposes virtually all legislation that actually alleviates our conditions. A call for the return to Obama-era politics ignores the fact that those politics directly led to Trump in the first place
TYT Reacts to Joe Biden's VP Pick, Kamala Harris  via
One reply was that she had registered and was excited to vote Biden/Harris!
If Biden wins, he will inevitably resign approximately halfway through his term, and Harris will lose the next election to a fascist worse than Trump because she was chosen solely on optics and will have no political mandate. Apparently Democrats are asking for that, though.
When I turned on FOX SPEWS (news) they had a clip of Tulsi Gabbard &amp; Kamala Harris going at it during a debate.  I guess they don’t have a clue as to what a historic moment this is with Biden picking Harris.
I’m not a Democrat but I’m voting for Biden. Happy to follow you.
I’m fine with that switch, I might not even notice - Joe Biden, Pete Butidedge(I know), as long as Kamala Harris is there, I’m good.
If you think Trump is anything that resembles a human being or a person of God , then hell is a place you will be placed! How dare you say Biden is not a Catholic! He is a good man and a good Catholic! Flawed yes but a damn sight better than that disgusting human waste in the WH!
This sounds so ridiculous outside of leftist Twitter. What has Trump done that is fascist? I remind you Obama/Biden were the ones that oversaw the NSA bulk data collection program and literally assassinated US citizens with drones. You wanna talk about government overreach? Lol
Also not a Biden fan necessarily I just want someone with at least a resume to run a fucking country that’s all..   You need a resume for Taco Bell but not one to run America?  Someone who doesn’t embarrass me when he talks...   These are some basic requests I feel...

I’ve been really open about the possibilities. I’ve really enjoyed the dialogue with all the potential choices. Women’s voices being raised. It’s been great! I am immediately stoked for Biden choosing Kamala.
You are a fantastic choice for Vice President, and I am thrilled to be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket!
Great choice, will make a powerful ticket! BIDEN/HARRIS 2020!
Member this article? I member.
Thank you, Joe! She is going to be a fantastic VP! Perfect choice! I can't wait to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket!!!!!!
I really think Joe Biden made the perfect choice for his running mate.  Kamala Harris is a brilliant woman, a tireless fighter for the people, a progressive, and I love that she is going to be the next Vice President of the United States!
Well, that didn't take long! Doesn't matter what the fuck you say. Biden knew Harris was the right pick, and WAS NAN ENOUGH TO GET OVER THAT ATTACK. She will be a great VP and rip you and your administration a new one! Can't wait!
I..........don’t think Kamala helps Biden in the Rust Belt and South.   *ducks*  🤷🏻‍♂️
I think Biden/Harris will kick ass!

tRump is in electoral hot water. It could be even worse for him by November The tide has turned and tRump is flailing. Even Texas and Georgia might be in play this year. #InFauciWeTrust #TrumpLoser
It matters.  Even my Democrat friends believe there is no way Biden makes it through 4 years so how is his VP candidate irrelevant ?    If he wins, the VP will be President one day. most likely sooner than later.
BREAKING NEWS UPDATE: Joe Biden has named Kamala Harris as his running mate, making the California senator the first Black and South Asian American woman to run on a major political party’s presidential ticket.
Laughable. The Democratic Party threw its commitment to women in the trash when they castigated and dragged  through the mud when the rape allegation against Biden is corroborated by more people than Kavanugh's own allegation.

Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP nominee  via
Here's a list of all the VPs Biden could choose that would make me vote for Trump instead:
Joe Biden selects his running mate, with announcement coming as early as today.
More useful: current positions.   Trump ordered deferred payroll taxes that fund social security &amp; Medicare.       Biden’s current platform.
And shouldn’t a man of faith be honest? Biden is clearly mentally challenged. You can see it by comparing his speeches from a few years ago. Compassion would get the man help not use him as a prop.
I’m curious about what you did to make that happen, contact Biden or Symone Sanders?  I think you would have been a good person to include, as well as Julian Castro &amp; Beto O’Rourke.
The ACA was so hated by the GOP they renamed it #Obamacare and then it became popular. THAT'S how we got protection from being denied insurance or bilked for extra money because of pre-existing conditions. Biden will make it even better.  #DemCast #ONEV1 #BlueDot
Of selecting a woman for Vice President, “Some people would say that men are insulted by that, and some people would say it’s fine. I don’t know.”- Trump 🤦‍♀️
But he says that Biden is the man with brain problems !
Shuck and Jive aka Diamond and Silk. Paid Trump actors. Anyone want to dispute that? Mary Trump says that Donald is a Sociopath. Joe Biden is a decent man. Trump is a dumpster fire. I hope the money is good girls, pimping for da cash, shame on both of you...
You are not offering any good alternatives Who else besides Biden at this point.?
I guess we will just have to wait until Biden is in office and take steps from there as you have said several times.
Can you imagine Biden picking Pete? This feels like meme-baiting.

Biden is so fantastic, he can be both sleepy and able to undo God! (I notice that Trump is putting himself above God, because "Sleepy Joe" is too scared to debate him but able to wipe out God. Some Christian!)
The Joe Biden conundrum. Yay, he’s riding a bike. Eeks, he’s not wearing a helmet. Good modeling for policy. Poor modeling for our kids.  Honestly, it’s good. He should do more “controversial good stuff”. It sets the online metrics ablaze with real discourse. That’s what we need.
So weird... I haven’t been able to find ANY Biden parades! #trumpwins
Just like he says that Biden hates God.  Listen to what he says and remember that he's talking about himself, not Democrats or Biden. It's always about Trump.
Just remember this: Whatever Trump accuses others of doing, that's what he does or would do. #Projection His campaign commercials attack Biden for the very things he subconsciously knows are true about himself. It's why they backfire.

Trump’s latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional — even for him
Anyone else think Dems trying this before the election is misguided? I can see people not vote for Biden over this because he has already said the little boy  is going to be in charge of taking guns from citizens.
‘Deranged’ Trump pummeled for lying ‘practicing Catholic’ Joe Biden will ‘hurt God’
Biden is "against god, guns and energy" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Overheard 2 people discussing the presidential election and one said she can't vote for Biden because "you'll get socialism with Biden." It's laughable that ppl actually believe that, but also so sad that we could've had the actual Democratic Socialist. What a mess.
Exactly! But Biden won't do that. He will revert to the way things are supposed to be. The DOJ works for the people, not the president.
‘A lying #DraftDodger’: Republican military #veterans slam Trump and declare their support for #Biden in new attack adI know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I’m thinking that you can’t help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
How do you know?  Obama didn’t immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don’t need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every “Trump” to “Biden” and every “Biden” to “Trump”.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
Joe Biden in a nutshell
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... naïve.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Help keep Social Security and make it stronger Mr Biden!
Help Social Security Mr Biden!

This isn’t about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
Interesting take: Biden’s civility &amp; humanity show weakness, whereas the constant lying, misogyny &amp; racism coming out of trump’s mouth are considered strength. Only the GOP could come up with this twisted logic.
She and Biden are the mass incarceration ticket. #ChainsYouCanBelieve in should be their campaign slogan.

Why do the Biden Dems look and sound like Reagan Republicans? Even the “big tent” is a Reagan line.
Biden's team pick of Kamala Harris does little to advance his chance of being elected Prez. Who really believes that a first term done nothing Senator has the capability knowledge &amp; courage to be Prez when Biden dies of another aneurysm or goes into total dementia?

Isn't Wisconsin a bit cash-strapped right now because of the virus which you refuse to do anything about? You were one of the first to cry Russia hoax. and yet look where you are getting your information from now, so is this now the Biden hoax?
Yup the dnc made a horrible mistake appointing biden thinking it was safe then told him to take harris who has a horrible track record prosecuting young black males, also many democrats are gun owners and both are very anti-firearms
What a joke Biden is.
Not the proper role of a President, Biden is a fool.
Proof that Biden has no idea of what a President does.
Biden won't solve these problems.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Bingo! Joe Biden showed he understands real politics and does not bear personal grudges. In short, Biden is a grownup.
It also shows how badly out of touch Dem leadership is, in nominating Joe Biden during a plague and then pushing him to take Kamala Harris as his running mate during an anti-cop uprising.
Imagine a real leader. No need to imagine. Joe Biden is that leader.
So good of you to campaign for Biden-Harris against your party.
Beto is 100% for Joe Biden. And Beto is a current and future star in the Democratic Party.
My stepson spent more of his life behind bars than out because of Joe Biden. He's a fascist who is the reason schools are still segregated and so many people are in prison for non-violent crime.
I think we should mix it up this year and have Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.
How will Biden and Harris take us to the middle? They're nearly as right as Trump.  Teach kids how to be grifters and thieves? Yes, I'm against that.
And Trump is hated by a majority of America because he actually committed real crimes, unlike your weird Biden conspiracies.
You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
You hate women! You’re threatened by smart women!
What do you have to say to your dad about this deplorable comment about women? We know how little he thinks of you
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He’s one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? 🤔
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I’m Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I’m voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
Brutal caricature of Biden &amp; Kamala Harris. Very funny!
It’s time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I’m reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say “I’d run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden” but I’m not seeing y’all actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where’s that devotion? 🤔
I’m voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I’ve seen and heard put forth.  They’re gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.
is a fucking liar, referring to him not knowing about Kanye Wests intention of stealing Biden votes.   They cooked this shit up and it will backfire on the  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteByMail2020
Are you sure she didn't mean Trump? Is she predicting violence against Biden?
The parts Biden wrote into law?
I still say John Kasich shouldn’t be there at all. There’s no legitimate reason. The #NeverTrump crowd practically nominated Biden.  Why does the strongest candidate to beat Trump need Kasich? 🤔
Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the “far left, socialist Democrats.” This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
CNN firmly in Biden camp
Nice to know!! Biden can’t tell the difference between the toilet or a shower. Let that sink in! No worries, Biden can’t find the sink so you’re safe.😂🤪
Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
4️⃣0️⃣% of home health workers are on SNAP or Medicaid while providing essential care during a pandemic. We need to  #ProtectEssentialWorkers by paying them fairly, and providing COVID-19 protections like PPE, sick leave and workers' compensation.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I’m not disaffiliated.  I’m very much a conservative which is why I don’t like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won’t complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers—I don’t recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.
Sorry, I tend to do that to Biden Bros.
I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
I’m voting for Biden, but there is no way this is accurate.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
You’re completely incapable of attacking Biden on issues so you have to resort to childish taunts. Sad
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

It's Kamala: Biden Picks Harris as Running Mate -
In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won’t make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you’re hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it’s a small number, I doubt it’s negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That’s not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can’t do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I’d consider volunteering for them but it’s Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
Moderately.  She’s very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the “adult” and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he’s saying it was a poor choice from Biden’s perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I’m more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might’ve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She’s like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.
Privileged entourage vote for Biden, privileged enough not to care.
Twitter all in for Jie Biden
Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I’m really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It’s a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.
Game over for Trump. Biden by chosing Kamala has assured a strong democratic base turnout and that was Trumps only hope to find a way to turn back the blue tsunami coming this November
I recall us making a wager in 2018 regarding Harris being chosen by Biden if he were to win the nomination. I said that if I were wrong I would put a Trump photo on Twitter. You said Biden wouldn’t and if he did you would post photo of you kissing your own ass :)
I’ve been arguing that Harris’ callout during that debate was a point in her favor. Biden needs people who will call him on bullshit, not people who only know how to kiss ass.
If Trump is still flailing by Election Day, I think a significant number of his supporters will stay home rather than risk voting.   Biden supporters will crawl through glass even if he is ahead by 20.
Harris is a Black woman who explicitly supports prison slavery.  Joe Biden is a white man whose greatest political achievement made prison slavery a huge business.  Yes, it’s a pro-slavery ticket. Any questions?
Trump thinks Biden picking Harris is a sign of weakness.
Dear Dr. Biden:  I am so excited to vote for your husband.  The last three and one half years have been difficult and working in public education and I have seen so many changes .  We need change and we look forward to your husband being elected.
Yes, I do still think we won’t be driven into a communist country under Biden.  You need to work on word definitions; here’s a good start -  Communism is a political/economic system, a classless society which the major means of production, are owned and controlled by the public.
Cheaters, Biden family gets rich at serving country.
It’s going to be hard for the Putin/Trump campaign to persuade Leftists that Harris is a neo-liberal shill while also telling the Trump base that she is the Marxist controller for Joe Biden.   Especially if we keep highlighting the contradiction.
In a classic moment of sentimentality temporarily eclipsing voting priorities... I was considerably more excited when I heard Kamala Harris had Church of God roots than I was earlier today, when I heard she was Biden's pick for VP nom. Still, a solid choice.
Enough with being cautious.   Biden/Harris will win.

Trump, you are disrespectful to women, veterans, the disabled, people of color, health experts, healthcare workers, journalists, as well as ignorant of the Constitution and history. Go to hell!
Is it wrong for me to say I think I like her more than Biden? Congrats Sen. Harris. Give 'em hell, and make me proud of my original home state. #KamalaHarrisForVP
She doesn’t stand against the people who stand against #BlackLivesMatter. She stands with the cops against the working class, like Biden and Trump.conservatives democrats always made the same promises biden does. 'business as usual' is not going to fix the over reach that just happenned. If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!
LIAR. Biden!!! Not a trusteorthy bone in your body!!!
Now is not the time in this universe to be picky about leaders. The choice is between Biden-Harris or Death.  Hmmm let me think about that...
If Trump is removing HUNDREDS of mail sorting machines and 1 in 4 votes are ALREADY mail in votes...  Who actually benefits more if democrats stay home and cant get their vote counted?  Who is actually trying to rig this election?  Biden or Trump?
Vice President Biden, there is a difference between absentee ballots and mass mail in ballots. Please review your civics and especially the US Constitution if you want my post graduate educated, white, female, non-victim, suburban vote.
bernie is even worse. damn the demoicrats for even talking to sanders and for runnind biden. Boith too conservative for me.
We can elect Joe Biden and Kamala but unless we get rid of the filibuster we will have political gridlock for at least the next 2 years.
I just heard Dan Bongino say the Harris Biden ticket wants us to wear masks all the time, inside and outside. I describe Joe Biden as Crucking fazy, I'm trying to be a lady.
We will never settle for Biden, we will not settle until this whole damn system has been dismantled, Biden and Trump seek to disarm the working class, which is an inherently bad thing as anyone who isn't armed is subject to the will of fascism, no matter who they are.
its always serious when its poor people, she said she wasnt to use the fbi to clean up our communities. What has she said shed do to stop the fbi from picking the president? What will biden do to stop that?

Anyway point being is there is too much risk and what if Oregon does have a shot of turning red because of massive voter suppression? Fuck the DNC and Biden for picking a cop VP but bite the bullet and vote for the bastard anyway because that’s pickle we in.

As a leftist who wants Biden to win, I have some advice for y’all in the establishment:  “Come the fuck on” is not going to convince leftists to vote for centrists. Try something else.
Didn’t attract anyone who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden
I am a touchy feely person like Biden. I hug everyone! These are his family!    At least he doesn’t molest women in clubs, dressing rooms, at pageants and have affairs while wife #3 is pregnant,oh &amp; brag about being able to grab women in their privates (used vulgar terminology).
And Biden/ the DNC haven't? One wrong doesn't negate another.   If I murder 1 or 5 people, I'm still a murderer. I don't understand how you #BlueMAGA people can support any of it. So gross.
Well guess  got snickered by  too. Oh well, not that he was ever known for anything other than RoboCop anyways. Enjoy Biden James!
FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.
Take Biden and an honest administration.
Nope. No fracture big enough to fit an orange dictator-wannabe through it. Not even close. Stop trying to make it seem like we aren’t all voting Biden/Harris no matter what. 48 million in 48 hours. There’s no contest in a free and fair election.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for police terrorism.
democrats hung hillary out to dry for 30 years... they presumed her guilty with no evidence. If trump wins again he will grind their pathetic elitis party to dust. if biden wins he wil;;l try to repeal some tax cuts :)
While Biden prepares to win the presidency come November, Trump plays 3 dimensional Chess with the Middle East and claims he’s made historical deals!! "Play it again Sam" how Republicans will lose everything in November! TRUMP IS A RACIST!!!
I’ve seen so many bad takes on how electing Biden is gonna be some big victory for queer rights and all I can think about is this
if "Work with Biden" means impeach him, make Harris president and completely undermine centrism by making congress a squad of 535... maybe they're half-right.

Joe Biden is definitely actually racist... Just look at his voting record...

JFK, FDR, Reagan, Obama, and now Pence. Wow what a speech giver. And the roar of the crowd. Watch out Biden this guy means business
They each had enough confidence to tell Biden’s VP vetting team directly that they thought it was Harris’s campaign. Amazing.
“One longtime Biden supporter told her bluntly that she should make clear she would not upstage Mr. Biden in the campaign, telling her, ‘You don’t need to be Sarah Palin to his John McCain.’”   Ok now I feel sorta bad for Harris 😭
“One longtime Biden supporter told her bluntly that she should make clear she would not upstage Mr. Biden in the campaign, telling her, ‘You don’t need to be Sarah Palin to his John McCain.’l
Let me get this straight in my head. Who has always had a pet dog? Trump or Biden?
“Biden advisers asked about contributions she received as state attorney general from Steven Mnuchin, who at the time was running a bank, OneWest, that was accused of violating foreclosure laws. Ms. Harris declined to pursue prosecutions in the case.”
Seems like a weak argument to me. I mean the Biden team's explanation of the process.

Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.
So Biden/Harris will mandate that everyone wear a mask for the next 3 months if elected? Guess they think if elected they will be king/queen, well they can kiss a$$, I'm not a child that needs a parent to decide what is in my best interest. Food will be next watch and see.
“You’re not allowed to criticize Biden and you’re not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!”  Considering the fact this is the time period when he’s *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.
We can vote for Biden and hold him accountable at the same time. It’s not like our brains ran out of energy to do multiple things   Blindly swearing allegiance while not holding him accountable is a terrible idea.
The vitriol and shocking statements coming from Trump are an indication of his insanity. He wants to prosecute Obama and Biden for treason???? What!!! Where are the men with white coats and straight jackets? Yet the criminal Republican Senators keep quiet.

Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.
This is ignorant of all the progress we've made these last years. The left is alive and strong. We will effectively pressure Biden and the democrats to clean up this mess. Our words are currently falling on deaf ears. It will not be like that after January.

Wasn’t even their first choice according to David Axelrod.  Biden wanted Whitner.
Warren’s event with Biden had 50k live viewers
Joe Biden has made it clear that he's a decent human being, in contrast to the corrupt and monstrous orange clown.
Biden Harris 2020  via   poot
Seems to me that everything Biden/Harris say they are going to do is already being done. They would however lock the country down so tight that when we were allowed to come out again we would be like Cuba/Venezuela. The country can't survive either one of them. #Trump2020
Hey  , how in the exact fuck is Biden/Harris gonna save our dying planet?
Why Biden won’t M4A : These assholes right here⬇️
You are my hero but I won’t be donating to Biden/Harris.   Neither of them support a wealth tax and that is my litmus test for donating. Harris is to the right of most Democrats on Israel as well. 😕
NPR talking about how financial managers are happy Biden chose Kamala Harris, I’m feeling nauseous
There was a lot of pressure from donors to pick Kamala Harris. Remember: Karen Bass is just as progressive as Warren and Biden still didn’t choose her.
that might be the secret of his success. sanders comey trump, democrats treat anyone who treats them like crap like gold. harris/biden proves they are not liberal now.
“That’s probably why we’re losing now”  Biden’s ahead of Trump in the polls.  No offense but you are kind of an airhead
Knit Picks' website isn't working and I need to get sock yarn, pronto, because knitting soothes anxiety (also I want my feet to be warm when I watch Biden/Harris win in the fall). If you have a fave place, please to tell. I'm looking at you,
No, I wanna keep that way. I'm still happy from watching BIDEN/HARRIS speech earlier!!!
Great reporting. You really nailed Biden here.
biden would bring back segregation, and harris would use the fbi to clean up the cities the way trump did. democrats screwed hillary because they are god damned nazis who deserve trump.
she is better choice then joe biden and hillary clinton, she dose not have  same backlash as both them.
Overwhelmed with the POSSIBILITIES that lie ahead of America with the leadership of Biden/Harris.......They are an amazing team.....
Between absolute cruising on his bike and the speech today, Biden is looking shockingly spry headed into the final stretch here. Honestly wasn’t sure he still had this in him.
vs   in March sounds lovely! Maybe we can invite President Biden? #wearamask #voteBlue #endthisnightmare
I’m feeling more apprehension. Wall Street seems to be happy with Biden’s choice. They typically don’t have Main Street’s best interests in mind.
Soooooo happy to watch Biden/Harris speak. There is hope, it actually cheered me up!! Who knew a speech would cheer me up?? LOL🙂#Biden/Harris 2020
Harris makes her real-life campaign debut side-by-side with Biden  via
you pushing biden/harris onto marginalized communities is u actively not acknowledging ur privilege and putting your comfort over people’s literal lives......if u can’t understand that i have no idea what to tell you
So everybody, please vote for what you believe in not the "lesser of 2 evils". Make your vote count and your voice be heard. If you do believe in Trump or Biden and vote the one you believe in then at least you are doing what you think is best and I will still support you.
He’s explaining why we won’t vote for Biden.
I’m all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden’s 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You’ve implied multiple times that young people’s opinions don’t matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it’s healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren’t thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
It really is dependent on the president.  Some presidents allow their VPs to have more power and influence, some don't.  If Biden has selected Warren (or Karen Bass!) that wouldve signaled a willingness to be more progressive.  Instead he chose Kamala Harris, an empty suit.
I know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both terrible politicians but please vote Democratic downballot in November 😔
Biden and Harris will be the best thing to happen to America sense Obama and Biden left office
Of course it is a shell game. But now we know it and time has come to change the game. This election is only part of it. But if Trump is elected again, the USA is dead and gone. At least with Biden, there is someone who will listen. Everything will change sooner than expected.
That Harris pick yesterday, hit Trump supporters like rabies! And yet, they know they would have hated ANYONE Biden picked.
Nothing about what I’ve said implies I’m not voting for Biden. We should be allowed to criticize the ticket
I believe that is the boat a lot of us are in. So, responding to every angry tweet with how if someone doesn't vote for Harris/Biden they will be ensuring mass deaths is really not necessary.  We know. We're angry and tired as hell, but we know.
Let me make this clear:  I am angry as hell that Kamala Harris was selected as VP.  But, me continually talking about just how pissed I am does NOT change my vote this November. I am still voting for Biden - I'm just even angrier about it than I was before.
Doesn’t attract any voter who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden. Young voters and progressives do not trust her
DwellerYsul, BULL HOCKEY! There was no infighting because the people pulling the strings on the Biden puppet were in full agreement. They knew enough not to bicker and put their brilliant plan to retake the WH in jeopardy. His only choice, if any, was for the prettiest one.
I don't ordinarily display political signs, but I ordered a Biden/Harris sticker, and I will display it proudly, full of hope! #BidenHarris2020
You can be angry with the VP choice and still vote for Biden.  Kamala Harris doesn’t support student debt relief, a wealth tax, or Medicare for All.  Her record as attorney general and DA has a lot of blemishes.   But at least she’s better than Mike Pence!
Yeah I’m voting for Biden as well
Oh yeah, Kamala is Joe Biden's little blue pill for sure.
I haven’t seen a single Warren person say they’re voting for Trump because of the Kamala VP choice  I have seen a ***lot*** of tweets from young people expressing their disdain and anger at Biden for his decision.
The way he uses stupid childish names to insult Biden and Kamala is beyond belief.
Let me debunk this lie:  Kamala Harris recorded her endorsement video for Joe Biden *before* Warren dropped out.
This comparison doesn’t feel right. I mean Biden is 71% campaigning in the background, so adjusted for that it seems he is doing much better.
CNN drops the death ticker the instant Biden is elected.
I know people in my own life that supported Biden and Kamala in the primaries and argued with me for months that didn’t even bother to register to vote in the primaries. These are deeply unserious people.
Joe is a friend to Wall St though...
You can't blame her for what has been in place for decades. But I sure as hell know that she and Biden are not Trump and are more open to change and reason. Get rid of Trump and the GOP in the Senate and the rest is much easier.
Criticize Harris and Biden but never forget the existential crisis we’re in right now. I’m voting for Biden and Harris and you should too. Then we’ll protest them too.
Biden had overwhelming black support in the south, specifically South Carolina. Across the country it was evenly split between him and Bernie.  Trump won suburban white women last time but the polling is showing he’s lost them.
Another liar. I bet you the farm that Biden did NOT say that.
And you're calling BIDEN racist. Give me a break, you lying hypocrite.
When will the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President receive security protection? Biden perhaps already has it because he’s a Former Vice President. Kamala Harris will need it immediately because of all of Trump’s crazy second amendment thugs. 👀👀
i’ve written out like a dozen draft tweets about the author of how to be an anti-racist supporting biden/harris and i just...... please........ why..............
That’s not gonna help fight against Biden’s lack of cognitive ability. He can’t get that back. Lol
no kate this is simply NOT POSSIBLE and i won’t entertain the thought for a SINGLE SECOND! i’m too busy settling for biden and thinking it’s an effective strategy to encourage disillusioned nonvoters!
The problem I see is Biden will continue shitty policy just be better at shutting up about it— he will deflect to KH who being a woman of color will be central to the discourse. So how much will actually change and how much will just be spit shined into something prettier?
For sure. He’s been my personal pick since I could vote, but all of them have done shit that’s negatively effected people. Yeah, imo Biden is the ‘lesser of two evils’. That doesn’t mean I have to like it or agree with him or not be unhappy about it. Just don’t want Trump again.
Thank you, Katy. The most heart wrenching aspect of the US politics is incrementalism. You aren’t going to fix it by accelerationism, and you can’t just skip to 2024. Every progressive should do everything in their power to make Biden a one term president.
I’m voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   If you’re not, you are only helping Donald Trump.   That’s your right, but I wish you could be adult enough to accept responsibility for the choice.
Well the Dems aren’t exactly known for playing “smart politics” as you say and I think what he said is spot on. It’s not like he’s openly stating he’s not voting Biden. The Dems cater to corporate interests and strive to be more concervative instead of truly progressive.
It’s kind of hilarious that the Biden team thinks choosing Harris is an actual appeal to the left. Yeah, let’s pick a prosecutor who has one of the most tumultuous relationships with the country’s Black community during historic anti-police protests.
I can’t get excited about Biden with anyone. Harris politically is somewhat undefined. But I do think having her on the ticket is a big step for this country. It does make more likely to vote for the ticket. Doesn’t mean I will ultimately.
Careful Kamala, joe Biden might rape you and then claim insanity. #CreepyJoeBiden #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #Election2020 #Biden2020Landslide #SusanRice #BidenIsAPredator #BidenIsARacist #BlackLivesMatter #DNC #DNCisCorrupt
I just saw someone on Twitter ranting about Biden and Harris being our only chance to prevent authoritarianism. Haha! People are fucking insane. This country is fucked. Authoritarianism is our only option. Choose your flavor wisely. Vanilla or ultra vanilla. #BidenHarris2020
I've donated to Joe Biden on quite a few occasions, but on this special day I dug deep like many of you. Thank you Joe and thank you Senator Harris! Kamala was the only pick and I'm so pleased to have her on the ticket!
Some parts of our culture will maybe not progress as fast as they should with Harris. Police reform will be MUCH more likely if Biden wins though.. don't fool yourself.
It might not even be that bad. If Biden wins, a more liberal congress and senate will likely follow. Universal health care will be closer to reality.. and maybe UBI will be at least discussed seriously.  If Trump wins.. holy shit.
The racist’s reaction to Joe Biden picking Senator Harris makes it clear how afraid they are of her.   They’re dumping everything they can on her (and him, of course)…but it’s just not working.
Wall Street executives are glad  Biden picked  Harris  "Harris, who generally could be called a centrist, will not push Biden to the left or the right on major policy issues,”  Wall Street won
Biden/Harris  -neither supports cutting the defense budget -neither supports student loan forgiveness -neither supports a wealth tax -neither supports breaking up Amazon/Facebook/Google  You’re obligated to vote for them but make sure you vote for actual progressives downballot..
Agreed. Biden really crushed any potential excitement for his campaign. Better than Trump/Pence (not saying much)
Ahead of Democratic convention, Biden leads Trump in new Wisconsin poll  via
Friendly reminder that EVEN if you don't like Biden's running mate or Biden... a vote for anyone other than him is a vote for Trump.
IMO, the only cabinet position that would be worth taking would be heading the Treasury Dept.  The rest would be a waste of Warren's talents.  If Biden isn't brave enough to make her his VP, then he definitely isn't brave enough to put her at the head of the Treasury.
The Warren supporters who are unsatisfied with Biden's VP choice because Harris isn't very progressive are signaling to Biden that he needs to move even more to the Left.   Critical tweets = signals to Biden's campaign that there is a deficit
There are 2 groups of people.  1. People who believe criticizing Biden may lead to him change the way he campaigns, making improvements, etc. "Constructive criticism helps."  2. People who believe all criticism is bad and only serves to hurt Biden and help Trump.
Biden has an enthusiasm gap problem.  He himself may not care about it and it may not matter in the end, ...but it does exist and the reason people are not enthusiastic about voting for Biden is because of the way he has run his campaign and the disdain he's shown to young voters
I like to think they (The Biden team) feel the same way you do. I think we all sort of get it. Bring on the ballsy woman of color. (I'm sure there's a better way of saying that).
Ah, we're at the stage of "If you criticize Joe Biden = You are voting for Trump!"  Please let's think/act like adults and not children. No one is perfect, especially not Biden
"Let her speak before you spend your nights helping Trump by attacking his opponents."  My god.  Did Biden's campaign destroy everyone's brain cells?  Criticism of Biden is not tantamount to supporting Donald Trump. Please think like an adult and not like a child
"He adopted some of her ideas in exchange for her support. That's politics. And Warren knows that. And she would do that because she believes in her plans more than a title."    No one is arguing that Biden adopting her plans is a bad thing, it's obviously a good thing.
Huh? Where did I say "Biden won because of Warren" ?? I said he used her donor network, because he did.   He literally did.    He had an event scheduled *today while he was announcing the VP choice*.  He used her network.  It feels gross.
I believe that to an extent-- Warren isn't a cow that can be milked to death.  She developed her grassroots network through hard work, networking, taking over a million selfies, etc., and Biden gets to reap the benefits.  She scratched his back-- Biden isn't scratching hers.
I'm sure Warren was happy to help Biden but I'm sure she was under the impression her impressive fundraising talents wouldve meant more in the veepstakes.  Seems like Harris was chosen to appease wealthy donors.  Entire thing sucks and feels gross
We are now stronger together with Biden/Harris 💙🇺🇸 #BidenHarris2020Landslide
No, I think Warren supporters have some legitimate grievances to feel angry about this entire thing.  Biden scheduled more events with Warren than with Harris-- why? Was it to get more campaign donations? He used Warren for her grassroots network.  It feels gross
When Trump calls something “horrible” bear in mind that he has an extremely limited vocabulary. If Harris had attacked Trump the way she went at Biden, Trump would certainly not have been man enough to put her on his ticket. Her ‘attack’ on him was factual, effective + justified.
There is no chance of her becoming Senate Majority Leader because Chuck Schumer will not give up power.  It's useless to even talk about it.  Biden used Warren supporters for campaign donations, we have a right to criticize and be angry.
I’m excited to vote for Biden / Harris 2020!!  Senator Harris, beyond all of her other accomplishments, has been a constant force for change from inside government. One cool thing she did was setup Open Justice, which increased transparency and accountab…
Didn’t the NRA say that about Obama/Biden and it never happened? Doesn’t seem like you know what you’re talking about.
the problem is its a markets arent always the best (yes we know) so we sit here and actually should probably vote for biden or trump will win
If you really want to freak out a Dump supporter just say that Biden will resign after a year and Kamala will be president. Watch their heads spin!
Joe Biden was baptized, confirmed, attends Mass and wasn't excommunicated therefore is he is Catholic. Given your strong pronouncement, I looked for a tweet about any of the 125 priests in your dioceses accused of pedophilia not being Catholic. Not a thing. Sad.
I wish Biden had chosen a progressive VP. Harris is a disappointing choice
👇👇👇👇👇and miss me with your concern-trolling about Biden or Harris. If you don’t think Biden-Harris is THEE ticket THIS YEAR, then vote for Trump like you planned to all along, but don’t pretend to be progressive.
Squad'll give President Biden some extra backbone.
Joe Biden: I want all the young Americans out there who have been protesting to know, I hear you! And my choice for Vice  President will assuredly always "Defend the Police!"
“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent how far America has come since defeating the Confederacy”  Joe Biden is not that old 💀
We will if Biden/Harris win in November. Get out and vote RED!
And I’m going to talk shit as I turn in my vote for Biden
I prefer progressive.... and you bet your ass I’m going to talk shit about Biden and Trump despite who wins!!!!! (Though, a Biden cabinet will be much much better).
The new talking point is already out. To say that it was racist to pick the VP based on race is racist because Trump is racist and anyone else is racist for not supporting Biden's racism about the race of his running mate pick...  The logic is simply dizzying. Literally.
Is there a memorable debate moment ft. Kamala Harris that doesn’t involve her calling Joe Biden a racist?
Watched Harris and Biden’s rhetoric with one another tonight on Hannity  My god what Are they thinkin About? Can it be true that the full Democratic Party endorses this Union?
Biden has my vote but my $$$ goes directly to Warren Dems from now on
For the record, I would’ve liked Karen Bass to be on the ticket with Biden and the way the media (and the other VP choices) helped smear her is reprehensible
I really hope someone on Biden’s campaign is paying attention to the backlash from the VP announcement
people can have a problem with harris’ past &amp; still vote for biden/harris this election. just bc they point out an issue doesn’t mean their support isn’t there. a lot of people are voting for biden BECAUSE it’s their only option.
Feels like Biden’s campaign doesn’t want support from young, minority voters.   I am disappointed with the VP choice.
Okay, so...  8/9/2020 - James "Kamala" Harris passes away. 8/11/2020 - Joe Biden announces Kamala Harris as his running mate. COINCIDENCE? Where the fuck is  ?!
Right now the odds are Biden with a 64% chance of winning, but since you're a fan of trump, I'll just bet even odds.
like people can take issue and critique the people running for office, that’s their right and it something they should do!! even if you’re voting for biden/harris you should still know their entire background and be critical of them?? that’s a normal thing to do as a voter
I suspect that Biden’s excellent choice has more to do with winning the election than with being vice president. My hunch is that Warren is the one (on his list) he works best with. She will doubtless get top cabinet post, and Harris will make a more enjoyable VP than even Pence.
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have spent their careers upholding policies that disadvantage POC and immigrants when they had the opportunity to stand up for what was right.
Young democrats / liberals: stop gaslighting progressives by attempting to shame us into voting for a candidate that we’re morally opposed to. We ALL know what is at risk. We ALL know what a vote for Joe Biden means.
Old white women are probably the only coalition Biden already had locked in. Wtf are you talking about?
“Smart, tough, and ready to lead” is how Joe Biden describes Kamala Harris.   Can you imagine Donald saying anything thing like that about a former rival?
Lol electoral priorities like... oh Biden doesn’t have any? He’s not actually about policy at all? He opposes marijuana legalization and M4A which both have sky high approval rating?
Won't lie, I was hoping for a VP Susan Rice. What a class act you are, and what a stellar public servant. I can't help but think there will be a great role for you with President Biden, as he works to try to save the world. Team America!
Harris said she believes Biden’s accuser (of sexual assault).  Both are going to have to answer for that.
just $1 mill more than Warren pulled in at a random event she did for Biden.  😴
Started a weekly donation to the Biden/Harris campaign. We're in the homestretch now, and we must do all we can to fight the rise of fascism in the United States.  #BidenHarris2020
Dr. Jason Johnson warns on MSNBC that young people who aren’t galvanized by Biden also wont be excited about Kamala Harris  👋 I am one of these people
i have a bad feeling joe biden is going to win 🙄
All these Republicans in Congress calling Biden/Harris socialists need to go get refunds on their undergraduate political science degrees
Kamala Harris was chosen as Biden’s VP candidate.
Historic Photo: Biden asks Harris to be his VP
Trump actually did build a wall, and we're all paying; great new ad from Joe Biden
Biden's viral bike ride video takes everyone back to Trump's feeble descent down a ramp
Democrats laud Harris as Biden's VP pick
At least Biden/Harris will not KILL &gt;162,000 Americans like tRump/Pence &amp; the irresponsible response to #COVID19 turning it into #TrumpPandemic   America can return to a country based on what is best for the country rather than what is better for #TrumpCrimeFamily
I'll take that.  Biden will get absolutely destroyed in a debate. I'm no Trump fan but to think he'd back down from Biden is laughable.
Trump's entire re-election strategy is based on fear. Biden's is based on positive and reassuring goals. The choice is so simple between those two candidates.
not to mention the barrage of vitriol and hatred the right is likely going to unleash upon black women bc of Harris, though, that was likely inevitable with any black woman on the ticket.   The least Biden could have done is pick one who hasn't jailed hundreds of POC.
Please don’t vote for Biden... Or Trump... #VoteGold
This does, in fact, make me like Biden a bit more.  I was gonna vote for Biden anyway, tbf, but his selection of Harris at least makes me feel a bit better about it.
Treasury is really the only spot where she would be able to make *real* change but Biden is too much of a coward to ask her to run it
and much like romanticizing your ex, electing biden is a stupid mistake that won't fix anything
realizing i’m gonna have to vote for biden/harris
Biden must not have understood when he heard she did well with the poles....
It really doesn’t matter cause the winner is ether Donald Trump or Joe Biden by not voting for Joe Biden that takes away one step away from evicting trump which YOU CLEARLY WANT please just vote for Biden and tolerate him and Kamala for the next 4 years
Harris: 'I believe' Biden accusers
Biden just lost the election and a not-so-civil war seems ever-more likely after November 😔
A few Bernicrats and Warren or die folks seem to prefer death by Trump to sensible policies and leverage for democracy by Harris and Biden. Honestly, i don't think there is anything much we can do to help such purist outlier haters, we just need regular folks to vote louder.
Lastly:    If Biden isn't brave enough to make Warren his VP, he definitely isn't brave enough to make her the Treasury Secretary.  His wealthy donors would never allow it.  He'll probably try to pigeonhole her in something innocuous like the Dept of Ed.  Hopefully she says no
Giving rich people special access to our politicians is nauseating and undemocratic.  My money will only go to politicians who support a wealth tax and student debt relief, Biden/Harris support neither.    They will get my vote but they dont get my money. Hell no
I am planning to vote for Joe Biden but I won't be donating to the campaign.  There's no point.   Biden and Harris both spent a large percentage of their time during the primary tap dancing for wealthy donors at private events.  Harris hasn't pushed Biden left on anything.
Kamala Harris being chosen to run as Biden's VP is extremely disappointing.  She has flipped on several major progressive issues and is more conservative than Biden on Israel/Palestine.  I initially supported her primary campaign but realized she was not a good manager nor leader
Yep ... you've lost a lot of us ! #Biden #Trump2020Landslide #TrumpHasNoPlan
The only thing you will ever be recognized for...the death of thousands due to your "Trump Virus". #TrumpHasNoPlan #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
Biden isn’t brave enough to appoint her to that position.  He’s a coward, he’ll ask if she wants to lead the Educ department or somewhere else innocuous
On a sad day for college football, Joe Biden did the right thing #BidenHarris2020Vision #GlassHalfFull
Elizabeth Warren would have been an infinitely much better VP than Kamala Harris. It’s true. That’s why Biden adopted a bunch of her plans and none of Kamala’s. “Warren has a plan for that!”  She’s guided by her moral compass, we need more people like that leading the country.
Please talk about what you will do to curtail your "Trump Virus". Looks like football is not happening, dude ! #Trump2020Landslide #FoxNews #Biden
😂😂😂 It's Happening ! #Trump2020Landslide #Biden Biden-Harris
Hell is prepared for Trump's eventual arrival. Ob that note, I like the Biden/Harris ticket👍🏻
😂😂 Sore Loser...your guy is doomed ! #Trump2020Landslide #Biden
It is truly exhausting in my bones to see the flurry of “don’t forget who we’re fighting” commentary. I haven’t; Biden and Harris are also the enemy. Your vote is almost meaningless. By all means, vote for them. I probably will too. /1
What's the strongest statement Biden has made about not running in 2024?
Conservatives claiming that Biden and Kamala are even more left than Bernie is laughable 😂🤣😂🤣
Who cares?  Biden-Harris is going to wipe the floor with you.
Guess Biden picked the right one.
Biden knows corn pop and Kamala’s a cop.
Joe Biden adopted 4-5 plans from Warren’s primary campaign and literally zero from Kamala Harris’s campaign.    I suppose we should be thankful.
A no vote for Biden Harris is a vote for trump
Not quite sure that the decision tells us this. I think Biden might think that Harris will work well as a defense against the left (and the protest movement) in a way that the various midwestern white women he considered would not.
Biden adopted 4-5 of Warren’s policies and literally zero from Kamala Harris.  This stinks
Biden is problematic, yes. But I would vote for a literal brick to get t-rump out. This upcoming election is about peoples survival. An old potato is better than a poisonous cheeto.
One last thing to be clear, Biden and Harris, is a way, WAAYY better choice than Trump, I'm just disappointed that the policies don't match 100% to what I believe will bring real tangible change for the people who need it the most.
Trump ends his press conference with the false claims Kamala Harris and the Democrats want to “take away for second amendment.” Before reporters can counter, he ends the presser and bolts away. #Trump #Biden #BidenHarris2020
For the most part, it's fine. She's definitely more progressive leaning and can read the room better than Biden. But at the same time, I have reservations for some aspects of her, including that she was a cop.
Doesn’t change any math for me. I don’t like her but I don’t like Biden either.
I’m going to donate $500 to Warren Dems because Biden was never going to go as far Left as I’d want him and the only chance of having a wealth tax or student debt relief is by helping elect more ****progressive**** Dems.
Okay, my response is two questions: where do you think we are in America right now (in terms of being set back or pushed forward), and what is a Biden administration pushing us backward?
What do I think about Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate? #KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris #DemExit
He says we'll have to learn Chinese if Biden wins. But its not like we started to learn Russian 3 and a half years ago.
I am stoked, I expected Harris but then again Biden is old and white so there was some uncertainty. He made the right move, hopefully it brings out the young vote once they get to know her!
I'm so excited about the Biden/Harris ticket.  looking forward to working to get you elected! #BidenHarris2020 #Shero
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has selected Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate.   Here are some facts about the senator from California.
Bernie, go back into the darkness where you've been. Those things that she would do or dangerous for this country. And you really think that Biden is going to win? Trump will wipe the floor with him in debates.
I'm sure Trump Kampf is elated by Biden's choice of the DNC's donor base-approved Kamala Harris for VP. They're betting America is still racist and sexist enough it'll pull enough points away from the Biden ticket that they win. So much depends on America being better than that.
Biden website is seriously overloaded, hard to use, but I managed to order a Tshirt and bumper stickers. #BidenHarris2020
Don’t care what she said to Biden. I care about her intent to destroy a Supreme Court justice nominee.
Yes, voting for Biden
Congratulations Biden/Harris Ticket woot woot
Who cares?  We'll be watching Biden/Harris coverage.
To do all the work for Biden/Harris? Nah
I feel like that's Biden 2020's basic message.
Congratulations, Senator Harris. Biden-Harris 2020!!!
Wouldnt it be funny if Biden ran for re-election
It is a shame that she can't also stand in for Biden and debate Trump.  That would be a fun one!
lol, Biden is creepy yes, but none of the accounts are RAPE like what  is accused of. I will take a hair sniffer over a rapist any day.
I am proud to support Biden/Harris2020 100%!

Welp. Not voting for Biden now. Crap. The one person on his list that would disqualify him from my vote...
Nah, the winning play is to have Kanye debate Biden.
Biden picks Kamala Harris for VP
Bigggest thing is Biden will never last as a President. His mental deficiencies will assure whomever is VP, will wind up President and shes not presidential material.
She handed us Steve Mnuchin. What a horrible pick, it's like Biden wants to lose.
It’s the truth. Biden is the one who said it
Sen. Kamala Harris Is Joe Biden’s VP Pick
She’s really good in front of cameras IMO, which is SUPER important when  Biden is on the ticket.
You are so afraid...Biden/Harris is going to help heal our country. I feel better already!I know, Hillary is offering to help in a Biden/Harris ticket, and I’m thinking that you can’t help if you are at Gitmo, can you?
That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Biden’s pick of Kamala Harris is the last nail in the coffin for his presidential aspirations. We cannot allow a blind lead the deaf in America which has finally risen to be the true super power of this world. This country needs you for four more years to finish the job.
What were you planning to do if Biden won?
How do you know?  Obama didn’t immediately end the war in Iraq and never closed Guantanamo Bay. Why will Biden be different after Trump?
I do not disagree&amp; I am super disillusioned about Biden. This Will be the 1st time I will throw up in my mouth a little bit when I vote. I had no particular opinion until after 2016 cuz I wasn't political. I'm mainly voted democratic &amp;pretty much Didn't pay attention Past that. 1
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
And why did Biden say to wear masks for next 3 months? Don’t need to wear masks after Nov 3rd??? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Writing copy for the GOP is easy: first write the truth, then do a word find-replace to change every “Trump” to “Biden” and every “Biden” to “Trump”.
He's a Biden troll, probably puppeted by Dr. Johnson.
Yes, this is more of the pre-explanation for Biden's defeat.
This isn't wrong. It's probably the biggest reason that Joe Biden is going to lose in November. Health insurance is a completely useless system. #MedicareForAll is a sensible compromise.  Biden supports making insurance execs richer with bigger ACA subsidies. How will that help?
He's vote shaming people for not supporting Biden now, isn't he? I know Cusack bullies anti-Russiagaters.
Why is he still attacking Bernie now that Biden is the nominee and Bernie has endorsed him? Is he trying to help Trump win?
I agree. Expecting Joe Biden to suddenly surrender to the protesters or strikers is... naïve.
The way I see it is that Biden is causing less emissions than Trump and that Biden has the strength to keep pushing.
Kamala only said she believed those women who said Biden's touching made them uncomfortable. None of them accused Biden of sexual abuse except for the discredited Tara Reade.  Kamala  never said she believed Reade.
This isn’t about who you personally like. This is about saving the rule of law and preventing fascism. Vote Biden now to secure your right to vote in future elections, because Trump is blatantly attacking this right.
She and Biden are the mass incarceration ticket. #ChainsYouCanBelieve in should be their campaign slogan.
But I'm not voting Biden/Harris
With the announcement of the Biden-Harris ticket, I’m more convinced than ever that we need a well organized and coordinated #GeneralStrike.   #ChainsYouCanBelieveIn
Why do the Biden Dems look and sound like Reagan Republicans? Even the “big tent” is a Reagan line.
We already know what we have with Trump. 4 more years of this is gonna be catastrophic. Biden isn't the best but abstaining from voting or not voting for Biden/Harris guarantees our demise. A lot of us see voting for Biden/Harris as taking an L...we need to think long game.
Vote for Biden, lower your expectations, and start listening to POC.
Is he helping pay for Biden campaign staff???🤷‍♂️🤨🤨🤨. If not fuck him
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Trump calls Biden's coronavirus plan unscientific, rejects call for national mask mandate
Using that same logic, a vote for third party is a vote for Trump. A vote for third party is a vote for Biden. As a #VoteGreen’r, my argument is... a vote for Trump is a vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump. #VoteGreen
You can’t tell anyone who thinks Biden is “center left” anything.
#UnitedLeft is explicitly anti-Biden.
Hardly. It will collapse if Biden doesn’t win.
Isn't Wisconsin a bit cash-strapped right now because of the virus which you refuse to do anything about? You were one of the first to cry Russia hoax. and yet look where you are getting your information from now, so is this now the Biden hoax?
Yup the dnc made a horrible mistake appointing biden thinking it was safe then told him to take harris who has a horrible track record prosecuting young black males, also many democrats are gun owners and both are very anti-firearms
What a joke Biden is.
Not the proper role of a President, Biden is a fool.
Proof that Biden has no idea of what a President does.
Biden won't solve these problems.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
Bingo! Joe Biden showed he understands real politics and does not bear personal grudges. In short, Biden is a grownup.
It also shows how badly out of touch Dem leadership is, in nominating Joe Biden during a plague and then pushing him to take Kamala Harris as his running mate during an anti-cop uprising.
Imagine a real leader. No need to imagine. Joe Biden is that leader.
Biden said he would pick a woman. He didn't qualify that with Black or white.
So good of you to campaign for Biden-Harris against your party.
Beto is 100% for Joe Biden. And Beto is a current and future star in the Democratic Party.
My stepson spent more of his life behind bars than out because of Joe Biden. He's a fascist who is the reason schools are still segregated and so many people are in prison for non-violent crime.
I think we should mix it up this year and have Kamala debate Trump and Biden debate Pence.
How will Biden and Harris take us to the middle? They're nearly as right as Trump.  Teach kids how to be grifters and thieves? Yes, I'm against that.
And Trump is hated by a majority of America because he actually committed real crimes, unlike your weird Biden conspiracies.
You don't appear to have any perspective.  What positive direction do you think Biden and Harris are moving in?  They remind me of Trump, honestly, and your platitude filled support for them reminds me of MAGA.  Congrats #BlueMaga.
Very plausible, though of course Biden actually wants to be tougher on Venezuela than Trump. Or so he claims.
How, exactly, are Biden and Harris "on the side of the people?"  They're on the side of the private prison contractors, the MIC, and Big Tech. None of those special interests are "the people."
I have no idea whether Joe knows he's lying or not, but it doesn't matter. The danger to this country are Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and the socialist mob they represent. Let's take the masks off, figuratively and literally, and keep America in the hands for Americans!
That's exactly why I don't have any faith in the Biden/Harris ticket. It's a Dem platform that ignores the reality of the world post-covid.
Suburban woman here.  Voting for Biden/Harris 2020!
Yeah, these idiots love to try and put everyone in a neat little box and assume that if you criticize Biden, you HAVE to be a Trump voter. They've successfully turned me into a Trump voter even though I've voted Libertarian for the last 2 elections.
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
So  you should really meet with  again. Make another #MedicareForAll commercial to get people to vote for Biden!  Then tell us you're against it when you're VP!
What  is calling the "center left position that Biden and white moderates have come around to" is giving the damned cops more money to kill people.  So yes, now is the time to attack Kamala and Biden on their horrific records and policies in this area.
How is that different from letting Biden kill our kids to "get rid of Trump?"
You mean Biden, the serial pawer?
Politicians are going to always do what they think they need to do to keep their positions secure, whether we as voters like it or not.  Is Benjamin Dixon actually "embracing Biden?"  We should be making it clear to Biden he can't win without us.
Honest answer. Biden is going to win, dems will get to at least 50 in the senate and the house will hold or expand. We don't give two shits what "half" of the country thinks. You people have helped this animal bring the country to its knees.
Whether Kamala Harris was my 1st choice or not, she is who is on the Biden ticket now and anybody- even Tulsi Gabbard- would be better than the tRump ticket! Even if there was no one in the VP position that'd be better than the current guy!
Awesome! I look forward to listening! I hope you speak less to us about why we should vote Biden, and more to Biden about how he can earn our vote. You are the strongest voice for change in the whole line up!
You're a segregationist apologist too. That's why you're defending Biden. It all makes sense now.
Biden/Harris 2020: we will keep dropping bombs and killing other people's kids!  H/t
You appear to be trying to unite everyone arod voting for Biden but haven't been able to offer a compelling argument for why we should or satisfactorily answer questions about your motives. You appear to be trying to divide us, in fact. We are all united. Join us?
So you have decided to unite us all by supporting Biden so we all turn on you?
So you're making the divisive stupidity worse by telling people to vote for Biden? That's stupid and divisive.  How is Biden not fascist?
Biden wants MORE of all those things.
Yes. So stop apologizing for Biden and telling us to embrace a fascist. Join the Left and help organize it instead of attacking it.  Voting for Biden is "what we have done" that hasn't worked. Repeated once more.
Biden said he would be tougher on protesters in Portland than Trump. You support that shit?  What do you think we're protesting in Portland?  Essentially, it's Biden and Kamala. Trump is just a symptom of their disease.
You're acting as if embracing Biden is somehow an improvement over the current circumstances. It isn't.
Why do you think Biden won't use live rounds?
I don’t have a problem. We need Biden Harris to win!
Check out Nate Silver's feed. Biden's numbers are softer than Hillary's. The Dems are in massive denial.
Life matters.
All lifes matter.
Dr. Glaude is not usually a shill. He’s one of many people who realizes te Dems could have done better than Biden, imo.
This morning on  I was very pleased to see  say clearly that Biden needs to be pushed to deliver specific policy solutions.  People are starting to speak up about the need for the Biden/Harris ticket to be more responsive to the Dem base.
Would be more important for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to start meeting with him regularly and listening to what he has to say.   Yes? 🤔
I'm a progressive and I am NOT voting for Biden and Kamala.  Pass it on. #GreenParty
I think the  is a damn great idea and a positive as I’m Progressive/Green/the democratic wing of the Democratic Party but I’m voting Biden to get Trump out. Progressives and left as possible down ballot and build leftist alternative parties to contest soon!
It’s time to grow the Green Party as much as possible yet I’m reluctantly voting Biden to get Trumps ass out. Damn I wish it was Sanders Warren or Vice versa ticket but down ballot and otherwise progressive as possible and Green if they have a chance
People say “I’d run through a bunch of murder hornets to vote for Biden” but I’m not seeing y’all actually be this dedicated about Biden cause. I did see people pour all their energy into calling people and going out to get people to vote for Bernie. Where’s that devotion? 🤔
Just a quick moment to let my mutuals know that I may be critical of biden/Harris but that does not mean in any way that I am voting for the hobgoblin in office, nor that I disagree with getting Dems back in office.  They just have a lot to prove to me and I hope they do so
amazing segment on Camarla Harris.. when u got to the Biden part, u &amp; I both erupted in laughter at exact same time and exact same fashion. I literally died.. I needed to be revived..
Because Biden is more conservative and authoritarian like a normal republican candidate. Come on dude u should know that
I’m voting for Biden no doubt and a progressive.  Still want some better legislation and more ambitious agenda than what I’ve seen and heard put forth.  They’re gonna have to whittle it down in Congress so aim high and settle a bit later
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Biden was supposed to have already done that.
I can't find anything referencing how you feel abt Biden's VP pick. I can see where you wouldve mixed emotions. In another time &amp; place you probably would have been chosen or at very least in top 2. I'm waiting to hear what administrative position he asks you to be in.
Also, don't flatter yourself.  The only thing I'm mad about is the general stupidity and futility of a "never-biden/never-trump" paradigm.
is a fucking liar, referring to him not knowing about Kanye Wests intention of stealing Biden votes.   They cooked this shit up and it will backfire on the  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteByMail2020
Are you sure she didn't mean Trump? Is she predicting violence against Biden?
The parts Biden wrote into law?
I still say John Kasich shouldn’t be there at all. There’s no legitimate reason. The #NeverTrump crowd practically nominated Biden.  Why does the strongest candidate to beat Trump need Kasich? 🤔
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..
CNN firmly in Biden camp
Nice to know!! Biden can’t tell the difference between the toilet or a shower. Let that sink in! No worries, Biden can’t find the sink so you’re safe.😂🤪
Do you think this is helping?? Does Trump??  This could be a Campaign Ad for Biden ffs
It's a cyclical problem. Biden won't make enough waves to drive up his negatives so Trump is forced to make news conferences, reenforcing his "show" reputation and keeping negatives high.
Biden introduces Harris, campaigning together for the first time in Delaware.
Oh, I know. Biden can't just bring it back, though.
Oh girl I'm done giving that foolery my energy. After Biden announced Sen. Harris as his running mate I feel like the elephant named Trump has been lifted. Baby girl I'm so happy I'm floating. I'm hopeful again and that's dangerous. I'm ready to vote yesterday.
Thank you  for not showing the mango madman showing more hatred and lies. It's a nice change. And thank you for airing the Biden and Harris speaches.
I’m not disaffiliated.  I’m very much a conservative which is why I don’t like either of the choices.  Many conservative pundits have said they will vote for Biden to get rid of Trump and I sympathize with that.
There was a poll in the news very recently said 60% of people think Biden won’t complete his first term.  Probably in all major papers—I don’t recall where I saw it.
Vote trump out if you can't vote Biden in.
Assuming u don't want trumpass in office anthr 4 years, why bash our only hope to end his reign of terror? If we don't end this, your chance of evr gettng a 3rd party in office goes out the door. Biden isn't the perfect choice, but he's our only hope.
You missed the most important part though.  There's actually no difference. Both Trump and Biden want to give the police more money, more manpower, and more military equipment.  Ignorant.
Dude, when you can tell me the difference between Biden's police reform plan and Trump's, you can talk down to me.
Okay, it was the second worst.  A vote for Biden is a vote for Trump.
Even more, you don't PRE-compromise your positions BEFORE the fight starts. Biden is pre-compromised.
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris make first public appearance as White House running mates.
Sorry, I tend to do that to Biden Bros.
I'm extremely happy about Biden's VP pick  #BidenHarris2020 #KamalaHarris
The Biden-Harris exchanges when Joe calls Kamala to 'ask' her the big question are as priceless as they are beautiful.
Notice he's not promising anything for Biden, just throwing the true charge at Trump.
WaPo will say and print anything to help Biden. Zero ethics.
Sounds like Joe Biden's plan.
That's exactly how I feel about it. Especially when they're using rallying cries like "people are dying."  Biden doesn't care and  should know it.
The earth will just move on to the next stage of evolution. We will all be dead, of course, unless you convince Biden to do something about it.
To quote the philosopher Carlin, "The world will be fine. The people are f*cked, but the world will be fine."  Get on Biden to save them.
Just say No to Joe Biden in 2020 if you want the USA to go Great again just say NO to Joe.

In order to enact the kind of change the radical left wants to see, and indeed I think many agree, we must have people who are open to being radicalized. Do I think that Biden or Harris are those people? Not necessarily.
Why We Need Blue: A Thread   I understand the frustration as someone who is not appeased by either party, and has not been in quite some time. I was not happy with the Clinton choice, and I am not happy with the Biden choice. HOWEVER
You do know the photo of Biden "hiding" was a photoshopped image. He was attending a football viewing party in Iowa with numerous people and press in attendance.
In the case of Biden, most people think he won’t make it all the way through his term so VP choice matters more than usual.  It sounds like you’re hypothesizing that a negligible # of voters are changeable.  Even it’s a small number, I doubt it’s negligible.
Joe Biden picked someone who could have been running mate any day of the week who just happens to be a woman of color. I am not going to celebrate until they win. I celebrated in 2016 and ended up heart broken. She can't make history without our help.
Exactly! She will challenge Biden when necessary and is ready to take the reins if needed. This is what we should expect in a VP, not the spineless sycophancy we have in Pence.
I can understand that. Completely. Biden is old.
We have that coming Biden/Harris!
I know at least one person who justifies voting for Biden because she feels more likely to survive his presidency. She bases this in her experience organizing under Trump versus organizing under Obama.  It doesn't appear to be hyperbole. I can back  up here.
This is you applying your personal logic which would cause you to predict Biden gets 100% of the vote.  You will be wrong.  There are always voters at the margin and Harris is not helpful to Biden at pulling those voters towards him.  That’s not smart for Biden.
Exactly what is foremost in my mind right now. Biden can’t do that.
Biden has that thing you call self esteem. It comes in that package of character that most of us are handed when we are born and is included in the daily values that our parents feed us as a child.
If she helps move the coming administration 10-20 more progressive, I’d consider volunteering for them but it’s Biden and Harris and their in it to get moderates and undecideds not as interested in the long term of the country in my opinion.  Still got my vote though
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
Moderately.  She’s very solid and the perfect attack so Biden can play above the fray and the “adult” and good guy.  Wanted someone with better policies and ideas (Warren) but Harris is cool
I think he’s saying it was a poor choice from Biden’s perspective.  I was considering voting Biden but Harris makes him less palatable to me.  I’m more likely to abstain now.  Hard to vote for a ticket with such a poor character as VP.
I think Karen Bass might’ve been more palatable to cross-over voters.  Harris mainly pleases people who are going to vote for Biden no matter what.  She’s like Trump in that she has no concept of the limits of presidential power.  I also think she will be vulnerable in 2024.
Eyuck! Biden doesn't even have a decent coat of paint.
The Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden and Harris, trying to portray them as far-left socialists -- a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists.  via   So Trump thinks that both Biden and Harris hate america! Just like Trump/Pence!
Every Trump supporter on Twitter upon learning Kamala named Biden's running mate.
If you really want to understand what we have in front of us, read Caste: The Origin of Our Discontents by  . There's a lot of work ahead to deconstruct the system of caste and Biden/Harris are the ones to get us started.
Privileged entourage vote for Biden, privileged enough not to care.
Twitter all in for Jie Biden
Wont support anything that hate monger has her name on just like id never support joe biden or anyone who supports him due to his decades of racism and hate
The top difference between you and her... she didn't have to be blackmailed to become a Biden supporter.
I’m really looking forward to this myself. Biden has always wanted the President to have the powers Trump is now using.
It’s a sign of character that Joe Biden picked the black woman who so publicly called him out on his problematic comments.   She called him out. He called her in.
Game over for Trump. Biden by chosing Kamala has assured a strong democratic base turnout and that was Trumps only hope to find a way to turn back the blue tsunami coming this November
I recall us making a wager in 2018 regarding Harris being chosen by Biden if he were to win the nomination. I said that if I were wrong I would put a Trump photo on Twitter. You said Biden wouldn’t and if he did you would post photo of you kissing your own ass :)
I’ve been arguing that Harris’ callout during that debate was a point in her favor. Biden needs people who will call him on bullshit, not people who only know how to kiss ass.
If Trump is still flailing by Election Day, I think a significant number of his supporters will stay home rather than risk voting.   Biden supporters will crawl through glass even if he is ahead by 20.
Harris is a Black woman who explicitly supports prison slavery.  Joe Biden is a white man whose greatest political achievement made prison slavery a huge business.  Yes, it’s a pro-slavery ticket. Any questions?
Trump thinks Biden picking Harris is a sign of weakness.
Dear Dr. Biden:  I am so excited to vote for your husband.  The last three and one half years have been difficult and working in public education and I have seen so many changes .  We need change and we look forward to your husband being elected.
Yes, I do still think we won’t be driven into a communist country under Biden.  You need to work on word definitions; here’s a good start -  Communism is a political/economic system, a classless society which the major means of production, are owned and controlled by the public.
Cheaters, Biden family gets rich at serving country.
It’s going to be hard for the Putin/Trump campaign to persuade Leftists that Harris is a neo-liberal shill while also telling the Trump base that she is the Marxist controller for Joe Biden.   Especially if we keep highlighting the contradiction.
In a classic moment of sentimentality temporarily eclipsing voting priorities... I was considerably more excited when I heard Kamala Harris had Church of God roots than I was earlier today, when I heard she was Biden's pick for VP nom. Still, a solid choice.
Enough with being cautious.   Biden/Harris will win.

Trump, you are disrespectful to women, veterans, the disabled, people of color, health experts, healthcare workers, journalists, as well as ignorant of the Constitution and history. Go to hell!
Is it wrong for me to say I think I like her more than Biden? Congrats Sen. Harris. Give 'em hell, and make me proud of my original home state. #KamalaHarrisForVP
She doesn’t stand against the people who stand against #BlackLivesMatter. She stands with the cops against the working class, like Biden and Trump.
Exactly. I understand people who feel like they have to vote against Trump. That’s a sane reaction. I would think about it if I were in a swing state.  I don’t understand people who swear Biden will be progressive.
It’s not progressive without #MedicareForAll. That’s the bare minimum and Biden couldn’t do that.  What do you find progressive in it?
Biden is a servant of the oligarchy establishment, so picking Harris was not a surprise, and predictable. If he wasn't such a blabbermouth fuck up when it comes to race, he probably would've picked military-contractor-defending Elizabeth Warren.
Do you think Biden knows what that website says?
We’re absolutely on the same page. A friend of mine actually changed her mind about holding her nose and voting for Biden over this.  It feels unwise of him in the midst of a pro-abolition uprising.
Biden was one of the authors of the original, 1990s, version of the PATRIOT Act that anti-Clinton Repubs opposed because Clinton was President. They passed it for Bush after 9/11 though.  Trump’s ICE and military abuses in the US are legal because of the PATRIOT Act.
Biden is Catholic
Biden/Harris gets my vote! ☑️
The trouble is that we don’t have established “trustworthy” leftists yet. Not with a modern political framework. Even  who I usually agree with, is taking a “but Trump” approach to Biden’s candidacy.
Not really, the PUMAs supported McCain because of Palin. KHive was essentially threatening to support Trump if Biden chose anyone else.
Thank you, Mr. Biden!!!!
Right. And the problem is even if he “wins” they’re lowering the bar with the base where if Biden doesn’t start drooling on his podium, he will look competent
Commentators: "Picking  really addresses Trump's criticism of   Why is Biden concerned with addressing the criticism of an intellectually-deficient psychopath? Is he running for Trump's vote?!
There will likely be 3 debates. Trump needs them now. And the right’s narrative that Biden is in dementia is delusional. It’s also stupid. If you say your opponent is going to shit his pants, and then he doesn’t, you’ve kind of played yourself
I hope Biden didn't make this selection just for the black woman demographic. Sen. Harris is smart, tough, compassionate. And will be an excellent VP.
They will really have no identity (or home) after a Biden win.
He thinks your argument sounds like the troll arguments to vote for Biden.

Don't think I was attacking you personally? I don't appreciate being called an idiot. I think Harris treated Biden like crap during debate. I thought Rice was much better candidate.
I've said all along I want Kamala but understood Joe Biden gets to pick and I will support his choice no matter who. I do not understand sour grapes politics. Winning requires unity; governance requires compromise, damnit!

Somebody should ask this idiot what the 19th Amendment is &amp; if he understands that women suffragettes were beaten and jailed by police in their cause of gaining women the right to vote. Who gives a damn that some men might be insulted by Biden's choice?
I honestly am not a big fan of Kamala Harris...I get the feeling that she does a lot of pandering and grandstanding.  I haven't quite gotten genuine policies from her.  But ill be DAMED if that deters me from voting for her.  Let's hope Biden/Harris gives the ppl what we need.

Biden is a racist
So you think this kinda behavior is helping you. The polls are showing that Biden is stedly climbing a head of you dude. STOP
Well since she’s libertarian id assume you’d vote republican but the point is any third party vote goes towards trump’s re-election b/c if you don’t want to vote for him and don’t vote for biden you’re helping him anyway
Biden will be the 45th president.  Stop counting Grover Cleveland twice.
Everyone’s going “and Biden’s the one we’re concerned about” in regards to trumps fucking astronomical stupid statement, and like, my dudes, you can say both are far gone old racist fucks that are going senile. You can continue to throw shit at Biden while you vote for him
Maga is tired of you too. Enjoy 4 more years cause Biden sure isn't bringing it home for the Dems.
The DNC doesn’t vote. Voters picked Biden. That is how we do things in a democracy.
Your being stuck on the idea that Bernie could not lose fair and square makes you as rigid as Trump’s base. Take a deep breath and snap out of it. Bernie has endorsed Biden.
Biden isn’t “trash.” It is essential that Trump be dethroned, wouldn’t you agree? How can that happen? One way: we have to elect Biden. Fortunately, within the realm of real possibility, he’s not a bad pick. He can bring us back from the abyss.
She endorsed Biden, so it’s very unlikely she will show at a third party convention.

I really think that the message that reality really did endorse Bernie has registered hard with people who understand economic policy and history.  The trouble is that Biden, his donors, and the Republicans pushing his candidacy aren’t ready to admit reality.  So they canceled it
Joe Biden is sold as the socially acceptable version of Donald Trump.

Enough of this garbage, please. We all have our favorites (mine is Kamala) but regardless of who Biden picks, it's his choice to make and his alone. I will support Joe Biden AND his pick for VP.

Absolutely not.  I think Biden will be declared incompetent and out in his first month.  Keep America Great!  Vote Trump. 🇺🇸
Another thing on Biden’s To-do list!
You need to pay more attention and stop doing what people tell you that you should do. The civil rights movement wasn’t about electing a President and antifascism won’t be either. Biden is fascist too.It took audacity for Biden to choose Harris? “The essence of audacity is having the bravery to do something that could offend others. Because of this, the word has both positive (bravery, bold) and negative (rude, impudent, disrespectful) connotations.” Go Joe! #BidenHarris2020
That’s why we need Biden and Harris.
Stop screwing up the Post Office. My neighbor didn't receive her medications on time &amp; she had a stroke. This has got to stop! You are hurting your voters. For my neighbor's husband; he is now voting for Biden. This will have huge backlash against you. Fire DeJoy now! Resign now.
I’m thinking if Biden is elected COVID-19 will just go away . Everyone will be happy 😃 back to normal ?
Way back then, the smart, young people in the Obama White House laughed at Slow Joe. He hasn't got any smarter.
So your shower is producing adequate water flow?  The watergate issue seems to only concern Fearful Leader Trump.  Biden and VP Kamela have not had one press conference or strategy meeting on low flow shower heads.
"For over a year now the media has tried to paint Joe Biden as a centrist candidate. Now that he’s picked Kamala Harris as his running mate, the media is doing its best to reinvent her as a moderate consensus candidate as well."
We already know what we have with Trump. 4 more years of this is gonna be catastrophic. Biden isn't the best but abstaining from voting or not voting for Biden/Harris guarantees our demise. A lot of us see voting for Biden/Harris as taking an L...we need to think long game.
Also imagine thinking Biden is the radical left...LMAOOO no ma’am. He’s a transphobic capitalist with dementia :( not radically left AT ALL
It doesn’t.  We use UPS, FedEx, or Amazon Logistics for ballots only to get Biden-Harris into office and then go about fixing the
Lifelong Republican: I'm voting Biden because I'm disgusted - CNN Politics
I’m amazed a good Catholic like Biden supports final term abortion, says nothing ab riots in major cities, and endorses a muderous regime like China - an atheist country!
I love Tik Tok  I have no problem signing up to this China owned company and agreeing to give them access to my phone, contacts emails location search history etc  Oh wait  The Biden campaign staff is not allowed to use TikTok for some strange reason? Hmmm
You aren’t going to solve them with Biden either.

Biden said he would pick a woman. He didn't qualify that with Black or white.
The radical left believes it would be able to push Slow Joe around like a rocking chair in an old folks home.
I’m saying that it will pull very few votes, that Kanye is basically a #maga dude, and the impact will likely be felt more on the right than the left.  The guy is a conspiracy theorist that wears a #maga hat.  What about that says “Biden alternative”?
You assume Black voters will split from Biden and go to Kanye because...he’s Black?

Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
You mean Biden, the serial pawer?
Whether Kamala Harris was my 1st choice or not, she is who is on the Biden ticket now and anybody- even Tulsi Gabbard- would be better than the tRump ticket! Even if there was no one in the VP position that'd be better than the current guy!
I don’t have a problem. We need Biden Harris to win!
And, you know what?, feel free to hold off on airing Biden/Harris events until they can be fact checked as well.  Make it a practice to fact check ALL of these sorts of things. (Don’t worry...there will be less work involved with the Biden/Harris events).
We all know that Democrats will take Biden off the ticket for health reasons. He has mental decline and she was just stating a feeling that the Dems won’t let him continue.
Coming from Biden himself.
I mean take it from Biden himself.
Thank goodness Joe Biden is now receiving daily intel reports so we have someone minding the store!
Just a quick moment to let my mutuals know that I may be critical of biden/Harris but that does not mean in any way that I am voting for the hobgoblin in office, nor that I disagree with getting Dems back in office.  They just have a lot to prove to me and I hope they do so
Because Biden is more conservative and authoritarian like a normal republican candidate. Come on dude u should know that
I am pleased to see you running with Mr Biden. It’s refreshing to see your energy and intelligence. We need your positivity.
Look, voting for Biden/Harris is unmistakably the right thing to do when the alternative is Trump/Pence. There's no question about that.  But you should know that doesn't mean you have to pretend they don't have flaws or act like they're your best friends.
Man everyone warming up to Biden as the "harmless uncle" of Obama because he wasn't Dick Cheney really did a number on some people's brains.
No you aren't. Trump trailing Biden in ALL swing states even Florida &amp; TX. 96% of what?
Yay. Vote Biden-Harris 2020. An entire press conference without even 1 lie. Trump lies all the time. He is stupid &amp; lazy.
Tears of joy may prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s- from the halfsheimer’s Biden is fighting already.
Im going to vote for Biden/Harris no matter what but having her clarify her intentions would go a long way for the confidence of many!
Whew. That Biden is now receiving daily intel briefings makes me feel better. Let’s hope Biden gets the real reports and not the Big Book variety tRump receives.
That doesn’t mean they are campaigning with her. It means they felt she was the better option at the time. Between the two of them Biden is the better option now, outside of third parties. I don’t deny reality, and the reality is Kamala Harris is NOT progressive.
This is a very well-written and well-reasoned piece.  Kamala Harris, Gen X’s Moment, and the Fall of House Boomer  via
Proclaiming we need to get Biden elected, because Trump is a danger to this country, and lying out your ass and saying  is progressive are two completely different things. I know  knows better than this.
You have some out there beliefs. There is no 3rd party. If you don't vote for Biden than you are voting for Donald Trump. What is your problem with Sen Harris?
At least she and Biden can speak in complete sentences
"The #RepublicanParty — whose best idea to deal with its deficit among minority voters is promoting the sad candidacy of Kanye West to divert a few Black votes from Biden — is only becoming more insular and resentful."
Hang in there. After Biden wins &amp; turns things around &amp; you will find most will never admit to being a MAGAt.
Biden has had 3x the lead Obama had over McCain pretty much the entire time.
"You remember Kamala Harris. She’s the one who, as California’s Attorney General, held back exculpatory evidence about a chap on death row in order to burnish her ‘tough on crime’ image."
Like what I pointed out, I am not a big fan of her, but that does not take away her qualification. She is smart &amp; capable of doing the job, she just was not selected b/c Kamala Harris happens to be a better choice for Joe Biden. Let's focus on giving the same choice to our ppl
I just think it's funny that despite the fact that West...  - is certifiably mentally ill and needs help - wears a #maga hat - openly supports Trump  ...the fact that he's Black was somehow enough to make them think that voters would switch from Biden.
Ok yes Biden is a creep and Kamala is a cop but if you think capitalist centrists are just as bad as openly racist, sexist, xenophobic FASCISTS then I literally don’t know where your head is at. Politics is a game and these equivocations are going to ruin the left’s chances
Just listened to Klobuchar and after 30secs of her droning voice, now undertsand why she wasn’t selected by the DNC - boring monotone. Nice lady who screwed up early on with cop cases - she claims to be close with Kamala - who b/c of Biden, will have lots of friends for 90 days.
Biden Harris is more a moderate conservative ticket than a liberal one, which is unacceptable to many.  However-  The current appointee in charge of USPS is removing mail sorting machines across the country. Not voting is not a solution.   #BidenHarris2020
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I'm 100% behind you &amp; Joe Biden, what an AWESOME TEAM. Trump is about to experience "You're FIRED!"
biden the republican using black people as mascots vote blue no matter who though
This foo said “joe Biden has a racism problem” 💀
Biden/Harris gets my vote! ☑️
Anyone mad at Harris for accepting the VP nom Bc she and Biden got into it during the debates is completely missing the point. What’s she supposed to do, ignore him and not step into this role where she has a chance to improve things?
Turnout will be historic trump will lose by double digits Biden/Harris will garner 97 percent of the black vote and the Asian vote will move from 67 percent to close to 80 percent.The cake is baked.
To these guys, Biden is:  - Demented - Radical/commie - Unable to speak clearly - Stuck in his basement  All things that are SUPER easy to dispel or are just ridiculously low bars to clear.  Trump's messaging is poor.
Joe Biden: "probably the best sort of pizza is a cream cheese pizze"  get the fuck outta here Joe
I mean yeah that's the thing, Harris is about as left as I think Biden was likely to pick and people who say otherwise are deluding themselves.
It's true though! The most famous thing about Biden before Obama picked him was how he shamelessly ripped off a Welsh politician's speech and backstory even though it didn't even fit his own background.
It may not really signify anything more than the fact that Biden is self-aware enough to know that as a man in his 70s he may literally not survive four years as President.  But Harris is still an unusually well vetted pick.
All I'm going to say about Kamala is I'm actually surprised Biden didn't just pick an empty suit for VP considering that's what most candidates due (including, let's be honest, Obama).
You knew that was coming as soon as the announcement was made. If the Biden campaign was smart, they should’ve waited until after his 5pm est campaign conference started then make the announcement so it throws his nonsense off kilter.
I donated to her campaign and I’m getting out the check book and sending in another check for Biden Harris 2020 #JoeBiden2020 #KamalaHarrisForVP
I just count on a Biden/Harris admin putting competent cabinet level people in place, not to mention any judicial positions.
Biden keeps makin' me not want to vote. Amazing.
honestly better tv than Biden and trump 😂
am I wrong?  Seems like Biden maybe asleep at the wheel here.
Sen. Kamala D. Harris named as Joe Biden’s running mate! Biden-Harris 2020 here we come!
I don't think a lot of people here is going to understand the repercussions of selecting Kamala Harris as the VP... someone who didn't poll well at all (single digit polling before dropping out). Biden's best chance at beating Trump laid outside of the DNC contenders.
Well since she’s libertarian id assume you’d vote republican but the point is any third party vote goes towards trump’s re-election b/c if you don’t want to vote for him and don’t vote for biden you’re helping him anyway
Big Poll Numbers For Joe Biden!
$50 says Trump makes some sort of remark about Biden’s VP not being attractive enough to represent the country.
To be fair, this is what we SHOULD do.  Joe Biden was always more likely to get the Dem nod.  This is a winner-take-all system, so closer to the center often wins.  But there are lots of progressive activists that will be part of the coalition.  Elect Biden, then get to work.
That's because you're not voting for Biden which means you ain't black😁
Remembering when I worried about POTUS withholding aid to Ukraine until they dished dirt on Biden.
Biden could pick my cat who is routinely outsmarted by his own tail and has a catnip addiction, and I would vote for him.
Maybe someone should remind the media that he has had to have brain surgery on both sides of this brain and obviously it had lasting effects. Joe Biden needs to have some sort of testing done before the election. #JoeBiden #BidenCognitiveDecline #donalddump #trump2020
Are you confusing Biden with Bernie??? That’s a Bernie image.
DC will burn down! It’s going to be bad but worse overall for the country if Biden wins.
Another thing on Biden’s To-do list!
I will still vote for Biden it he selects Baily Sen. Warren's dog. 😃
I don’t think Trump is going to beat Biden at this point, but his mental health is obviously a concern.
Where in the picture did Biden touch you?
Where have they been for the four years? Biden was doing a great  job on himself by himself - now he’s been corraled, bipartially muted, and sedated, but they sent his lookalike out on  a bike!!??
This isn't to say Dukakis didn't blow a lead...but he didn't blow a 17-point lead.  He blew like a 5-point lead.  Also, Dukakis was a doofus.  Biden is not.  And Bush was not Trump :)
As usual trump has attempted to pull the curtains over his EO! Absolutely outrageous! We need to kick him out of office with a resounding vote for Biden!
And why, Queen Nancy, should I give a scat about what China wants? Look around you, the world is masked thanks to them. China wanting Biden is a ‘kiss of death’ to his candidacy. ‘Member, your ice cream is not made in China, but your mask is.

This seems to be part of Trump’s re-election plan. He is trying to make Biden out to be a radical leftist. It’s not going to work, most people know Biden’s record and what he wants to do.
Pay to play Biden.  No thanks. Switched to Republican,  voting Trump for my first time. Democrats are liars and cheats
Yep, and now Trump is doing the same. I also don’t have high hopes for the Biden administration.
Declassify the intellegence about Russia's interference in 2020 election now. We have a right to know what is going on. Sen Johnson's fake investigation into the Biden's needs to be translated from the original Russian from whence it came. Are u willing to sell out US for power?
Biden says some ofbthe most racist crap in the open and on live TV. This is the Mayor of Baltimore's reaction.   President Trump says "colored paper" and this same mayor would lose it.
If you are going to talk about  at all you need... you must give equal time to  ... or do you not believe she deserves to be heard. #LetHerSpeak she is a smart, talented, patriot and deserves to be heard.  Stop propping up creepy uncle racist joe Biden
I don't really have an opinion. I leave that to Joe Biden. Do you have a fav? Just curious.
That is one heckuva long dock. Hope the island is worth the walk. Maybe that’s where Biden is staying?
Going to Mass on Sunday and accepting communion does not a Catholic or Christian make. If a role model, you do not accept abortion or allow persecution of fellow Christians or decry religious traditions or tolerate injustice or profit from deceit or manipulate sinful acts. Biden!
Agreed. Frankly I am tired of all the attention to these rumors. I trust Joe Biden to make his own choice. It's personal he needs &amp; deserves to take however much time he needs. We already know he expects to choose a woman &amp; that's enough for me. Plus he will have a diverse cabnt.
Tell her if Biden gets elected maybe they can finally impeach Hilary. Hahaha.
They are going to push so hard for regime change in Venezuela if Biden wins.
Please take Biden’s place and run for President Andrew!  Yang gang can get it done. Joe can’t
The effect of cutting old and redundant regulations that have been on the books since the 1950s, and what this has done for the everyday person. Biden had 8 years to do that and did not.

There’s a lot of this from left of Biden.  Not sure what you’re wanting him to do.  He’s been up 7-10 points for months.
You can trust the polls as much as you can the media.
Anyone waiting for a candidate to beg...it ain't gonna happen. Isn't stopping fascism enough??!! That's among the billion or so reasons to be Ridin with Biden
"The problem with all of this talk about Biden and faith is that he professes to be a Roman Catholic. A Roman Catholic who just a week ago was proudly mentioning an endorsement from an abortion-rights organization."
Now hopefully these gamers will vote Biden
The crazies were lining the streets but the real voters will support Biden. Your followers will continue to follow you off a cliff like lemmings

Biden said he didn’t want his kids growing up in a racial jungle
My trump follower landlord came by to fix our frig. I turned on MSNBC. Trump says Joe Biden is against God. I started laughing. He said all campaigns seasons are weird but this one is particularly weird. He went on to tell me that he voted for tRump &amp; he is an ass. But I like
If you Google "images of Joe Biden praying" you'll see many different images of a man humbling himself before God - lost in deep in prayer.  See what you get if you Google the same thing for Trump.
So you’re saying Biden has a chance to change the constitution, something you haven’t been able to do? Sounds like he’d be a powerful leader then.You and jo biden need to go away.
Joe Biden in a nutshell
It’s ok to hate him, and still vote for him. It’s people who vote for Biden out of spite that puzzle me.

Interesting take: Biden’s civility &amp; humanity show weakness, whereas the constant lying, misogyny &amp; racism coming out of trump’s mouth are considered strength. Only the GOP could come up with this twisted logic.

Well,  and  aren’t republican either. I think they’ll endorse Biden.
Let’s all just start following Biden and Harris’ lead and do the things they suggest, before they are even in office. We’re better off following their leadership and it just might make 45’s head explode. 😂🤣
Donnie, stop spreading the Fake News.  There are 11 swing states identified by    According to  polls Biden is winning 9 of those 11 most by sizable margins.

What do you have to say to your dad about this deplorable comment about women? We know how little he thinks of you
Is this to help Joe Biden?
I could see Biden doing 8 years and then Harris doing another 8 years
Biden and Harris are news.  Trump is not.
Harris and Biden are both low grade archons.
Limiting AOC speaking time is about limiting Republican attack point that Biden will be a patsy for the “far left, socialist Democrats.” This is about cutting the attack off at the pass.
Okay I got to give props to Sarah Palin for this one.... Credit where credit is due..

I’m also a career woman living in the suburbs and am ecstatic about voting for the Biden/Harris ticket. I can’t wait to boot this racist out of office!
Yes- vote Biden/Harris
this you?
The only hesitation I had about Kamala Harris as VP is that I think she is better than that job will allow her to be and she won't be happy in it. But if Biden gives her a consequential role then maybe it will prepare her and the country for her as POTUS in '24.  (white lefty)
I bet she will blow Biden.
oh please by the time Biden gets elected he will pull a Harris and have a short time in office and we'll be stuck with kookie Kamala
As a former Californian, this is a very poor choice for Biden. She was picked based on color and not on her character. 🤦‍♂️
Biden should’ve picked Dark Magician as his VP
Absolutely love it! She's smart, tough and a great support for Biden. Couldn't have had a better pick! #BidenHarris2020

I don't think Biden's going to go for 8.
I was happy (relieved?) to vote for Joe. I’m ECSTATIC about the Biden/Harris ticket!!
12, if Biden steps down after 4, then she gets two terms.
Clearly, that was intended as a metaphor meaning that, with that sparring dynamic they showed, they displayed a lot of respect for each other, and that the ticket was going to be Biden/Harris at the end of the primary season.  If you can't read that into my tweet, *whatever*.
Biden could pick a cadaver for his running mate and I am still voting for him!
The VP Intro should be boring IMO. Drop the suspense, introduce the person, let the person speak to America. No drama. If you're the Biden campaign, the strategy here should be make America boring again.

hey Sandra, did you ever see the speech where Biden said “poor kids are just as smart as white kids” that was 2 months ago. So to him every minority is “poor”. He also said he doesn’t want his kids &amp; grandchildren growing up in a “racial jungle”
Now you won't know whether it was your threat or his character that made the choice. A pity.   And any who see Trump and GOP for who they are and conjures up a reason not to vote for Biden are just choosing to bury themselves in the rubble Trump is making of America.

I noticed Joe Biden wasn't wearing one this weekend too. Kind of a bummer to see that.

Radical left of Biden- you say! Joke!  Trump’s a fascist dictator- destroying American founding principles and our democratic republic- be ashamed for spreading dangerous lies. The rich need to pay more taxes!
Liar- Biden doesn’t stand for the radical left-wing. It’s just because your a radical right that you want to spread lies and misinformation
Unchristian that this would be used against Biden AND what a deflection from the real racist!
Yes, I’m 62 yrs old, diabetic &amp; I smoke cigarettes, I will quit when Biden wins in November. I might have to wait until January bc trumps voice &amp; antics, being pathological liar, constantly embarrassing us along w/ #ComplicitCorruptGOP makes me smoke more, UGH!! Can I sue them?
Id love to blame it on dementia but we all know that Biden is a racist. Not that hard to find his previous racist remarks.
Typical. Makes a racist remark yet everyone looks away. If trump said this it would be the end of the world. The Dems are hypocritical. Especially biden. He has a rich past of being racist.
Joe "the racist" biden
CORRECT! Thank you President Biden!!
He’s absolutely wacko and sounds very, very desperate.  Grabbing at everything he can think of to try to disparage Biden.  Guns, God, Energy.  All in the same breath.
He is only going to get more and more unhinged as we get closer to election day...... soon, he'll be saying "Joe Biden is just a bunch of snakes wearing a trenchcoat!"That’s one of those countries Trump will say Joe Biden doesn’t know- because Trump doesn’t know.
I wonder if Kamala is gonna give Biden an N word pass
We need to wake up because if Biden becomes president this will be normal and he will say it is ok.  We have got to stand up for our freedoms before we lose them.  We can not expect others to do it for us.  God bless America and President Trump
By not debating the Great Potato in Chief (Tater trump) the "president" will claim that Joe Biden is afraid (too senile, uninformed, unintelligent, et al) to debate him. The Domestic Terrorist in Chief (Murder Bounties on American Soldiers) is not capable of debating Joe Biden.
Here’s there boy, Biden, and if elected will make great failures with the liberals a reality for America.  Nothing good for our country will happen with Biden/Harris!  ⁦ ⁦
Joe Biden is a registered pervert with his local county clerks office because he is democrat
Joe Biden is a communist butt bitch Democrat
Joe Biden is a lover of male and female homosexuals the fucking 4F-queer
I can’t stand how politicians aggressively criticize opponents but then team up with them after they lose. Like Trump insulting Ted Cruz’s wife. Bernie and Kamala loving Joe Biden now. If someone didn’t do this shit, they probably would be president themselves
She would only run in 24 if Biden didn’t run for a second term. So most likely looking at a 2028 campaign.

At least, either Biden/Harris or Harris/Biden, we will have a President and not an extension of Putin's dick.
Biden picks Kamala.  Trump gonna dump pence and add Omarosa
So much for Lying late in the game. MAGAt hats are made in China. Ivanka (Mrs. Ferret) has a butt-load of Chinese Trademarks and Sweat-shops  When Joe Biden wins in November America will be able to start cleaning the stain of the trump Crime Family from our Nation.  No more Lies.
Biden website redesign is good.
Obviously Biden/Harris is a infinitely better option than Trump, anyone who thinks otherwise is rolling in privilege. But "just doing her job" is not a good defense, especially when the job is law enforcement.
Hell yea!!!! Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate #BidenHarris2020
Joe Biden's running mate is a cop.  I did not see that coming.

Biden picking Harris shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone
I’m more amazed by CNN’s cognitive dissonance than I am concerned about Biden’s cognitive deterioration.
Biden/wine moms
Don't listen to the hype.  The Domestic Terrorist in Chief cannot close the USPS, defund SSA (Medicare nor Medicaid), nor stop Vote By Mail by himself. The Putin Party Members (Republicans) are not going to help him with that in an Election Year.  Biden will win.
2/  And Joe Biden hasn't received any of Putin's Murder Bounties on American Soldiers.  Explain to us how wonderful the Putin Party (Republicans) is while you are Golfing and denigrating BLM and posing with The Book in front of a Church you have darkened the door of 1 or 2 times.
Even if Joe Biden gets elected to the white house he will still be Obama's butt bitch
When Joe Biden was vice president of the united states all those 8 years he was President Obama's butt bitch all those 8 years and Joe Biden is still Obama's butt bitch
No one is worried about Biden himself. Biden is now a puppet for the extremist Left...and yes the Left does have power and depending on your definition of "God" and "destroy" they can and will do that as well.
“Unlike the African American community with notable exceptions.” More proof Biden sees black Americans as a monolithic entity.Drew... Biden is going to lose big. Don’t be too sad 😢 I am sorry
Come on, folks. Come visit this person's tweet, and tell him/her why YOU are voting for Biden and Harris. Make sure not to use the word "Trump" - apparently s/he finds that word offensive.
Because several people I know, starting with my elderly mother wo is over 80 and has Alzheimer's, depend on Social Security, which is under threat by current policies, which candidate Biden promises to reverse.  Sorry to have made you wait so long.
Wear a facemask with a BIDEN button pinned to it, and a clothespin clipped to the mask to show that you're holding your nose in order to vote for Biden.  VOTE for Biden - otherwise, you ARE voting for donald, whether you're voting for someone else, or just sitting on your ass.
how well did his promise to spend billions on Biden work out
This is so what we need: Net Zero is now mainstream! #ClimateAction #GreenRecovery #FossilFree
This is awesome.  I actually like Biden a bit more than a mask, but if you are in this position, I can respect your POV.
But note that I'm much more opposed to Biden in general, I just also don't think that Harris was a good pick for VP - for a candidate who has NOT been accused of sexual harassment, see Jo Jorgensen:
What “light” are you talking about? You spelled Biden wrong; it’s spelled T r u m p.
Vote for Biden
The second reason is they wanted to disrespect blk ppl bc that is the southern stategy is to through political sneak shots or straight in your face diss shots. And to replace Biden with her
Uh, what reality are you living in? The two largest federal employees unions have already endorsed Biden. Start paying attention.

Biden &amp; Harris Are The Reason Black Voters Will Stay Home!  via  good information especially the info on black dem women and how they are being used like whores
The danger for Biden isn’t that Latinos swing for Trump, but that they won’t turn out to vote in battleground states.

...with enough money to remain functional, not just the ones  with legislatures loyal to the President's party, Biden will ensure that all states will be able to keep their people indoors until there are very few contagious cases remaining. This is what was done in every . . .
1) donald believes in running government like a business. Fortunately, Biden believes in running government like a government. He will open negotiations with Congress to organize a lockdown, which, yes, will cost money. THIS time, the money will be spent wisely, instead of . . .
Joe Biden thinks that "Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months, at a minimum".   I think Joe Biden should take off his face mask so he can get more oxygen into his brain.
Um, your comment is hard to follow, perhaps due to your doing arithmetic the way Republicans do it when they control the Federal budget. You seem to be claiming that snakes are ducks, so more people would be dead if Biden had been President for the last four years. I doubt it.
I would rather COVID-19 spread under Biden the way H1N1 spread under Obama/Biden than the way COVID-19 spread under donald.
First thing Biden is going to do when in the Oval is strengthen the nepotism guidelines at the WH.
This is what you get as a black person under Biden and Harris laws and enforcement
If Biden didn’t need the black vote and  then Roland Martin wouldn’t be ranting about black voter to black voters or to everybody else
Remember whe Roland Martin was like black voters are the smartest when he said they shut Hilary down for being insincere for the crime bill now he’s mad that it’s happening to Biden. What a hypocrit. Remember he said the crime bill and black voters is what shit Hilary down.
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.
Joe Biden humiliates Trump amid his attacks on Kamala Harris  via    The only thing donald is taking swift and decisive action on is crippling the #USPS.

We have 5% of the global population and 25% of the global incarceration. All under Biden and kamala. No ask yourself black women and men who votes dem do you want your son to be apart of their statistics
Blk women need to listen to blk men when we say voting for Biden and kamala is like voting for slavery. Stop being baited with the tokens and symbols
Let me remind y’all he seriousness this has to be. Aipac want blk ppl gone ws want the same both represent either white isreal and white america both oppose blk ppl. Both endorses Biden and kamala. Both caused harmed to blk ppl but yet it’s the blk dems who keep defending them.
Now Comes the Difficult Work of Pushing the Biden-Harris Ticket Left
It should be no surprise Kamala Harris has been chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate. From her career-long pursuit of right-wing goals to her flexibility with the truth, the two are remarkably similar politicians.

You're the news guy. What's the story? If you're talking about Biden you might check into a thunderstorm and a generator.
Maya Rudolph, portrayer of Kamala Harris on "SNL," admits she could be busy ahead of the election after Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate.
True, although in the main post they say Biden is favored to win
I can understand that, Biden is a disappointing option to say the least, but donald is so much more than the greater of two evils - he is truly evil incarnate. He was famously rated 45th out of 45 Presidents. Personally, I rank him 46th, below Jefferson Davis.
Trump Says Biden Insulted Every Man On Earth By Choosing Female Running ...  via  Wonderful! I love it! "It's actually pretty okay to insult THOSE men, because they're assholes!" Yes!
On cnn they announced that the confidence in the polices quote “it is the lowest it has been since three decades ago.” Wonder why because 3 decades ago guess who’s been making the laws on crime Biden
Just remember blk ppl didn’t pick her or joe Biden. The fact joe one in a swing state was bc of one blk person and overwhelming a bunch of whites in sc. fact there’s no blk agenda in this country pick just white ones with poc face.
I think Biden/Harris is an awful ticket, but I'll vote for them, encourage my friends/family to vote for them, and do whatever it takes to get them into office.  But they're just so bad.
JUST IN: Tim Kaine responds to Kamala Harris being picked as Joe Biden's...  via  be prepared for whitefolks to keep saying this bc this is how political correctness works the drill the lie In you’re head from a hundred different directions
Something I've noticed on social media since Biden picked his VP is the number of white people complaining vs BIPOC being relieved/excited. It feels like I'm seeing a lot of white people not willing to vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, which seems...like a cop out honestly?
More like the klansman and hitler. Biden in hitler for blk ppl trump is racist but a selfish one he only cares for himself really. Trump does what he does to hide the fact that he’s passing laws really for himself and his properties
Liberal pundits are touting Joe Biden as a potentially transformative president in the mold of FDR. His donor lists — and his own words — say otherwise.
Vice President Biden choosing a woman of color to run against donald and Mike Pence is an interesting definition of "safe", considering the record U.S. voters have, which suggests very strongly that racism is still a big problem, and misogyny may be an even bigger one.
What Joe Biden's historic selection of Kamala Harris tells us about how he would govern
Rep. Karen Bass is no socialist, but she's hung around a few of us in the past. Because of this, as her name was floated for Biden's vice presidency, she's been subjected to McCarthyist-style smears. We on the Left have to clearly and loudly stand against
On Tuesday, Joe Biden finally announced his running mate. Here’s what our panelists think about the choice
Harris and Biden’s late son were longtime allies, helping to cement the relationship behind the Democratic ticket
"The United States urgently needs a leader who will have the courage to look at, think hard about, and speak openly about the dire perils posed by our country's vast nuclear arsenal."
"All of us will need to do everything we can do defeat Donald Trump this November, and Joe Biden will need strong progressive energy to win," said the PCCC in response.
Biden's selection of the California senator comes after Wall Street executives made clear that they would prefer "almost anyone" but Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Despite decades in government, Joe Biden remains less sharply defined to voters than previous presidential nominees.
Harris is the third woman in U.S. history to be named as a vice-presidential candidate for a major political party.
Andrew Yang in Joe Biden Administration?  via  Biden should roll out his entire Cabinet and send them out to campaign as his proxies, to provide contrast  to the corruption and incompetence of donald's swamp dwellers.
Like...if the Biden/Harris ticket does win, I'm not expecting a whole lot of changes. I expect Obama-lite (and even Obama was pretty moderate, tbh) form Biden/Harris.  Basically, I'm not expecting a major cultural shift from that ticket. But..it's still better than Trump..sooo..
I personally feel like Kamala Harris was probably one of the worse choices Biden could have made for VP but she’s sill better than the complete trash that is Trump/Pence.   She’s referred to as a cop for a reason and with BLM I feel like that was a big miscalculation on Biden.
"Joe Biden can go suck a dick... Maybe of we all agree to behave ourselves maybe we don't need a president" - My mother  Ladies, Gentlemen and Everyone In Between, I think I did it.
Going to focus on the tremendous news of Ilhan Omar winning today's primary.  And, yes, you self-righteous, bloviating, performative nags; of course I'm going to vote for Biden/Harris, because anything is better than Trump. But the Biden/Harris ticket suuuuucks.
I'm ok w/ the choice of Kamala Harris as VP running mate for Biden. I''m still not a Biden fan, but I definitely feel more comfortable voting for Biden/Harris than, say, Biden/Whitmer.  I would have felt MUCH more comfortable voting for Harris/Warren or Warren/Harris, but..well..
Well that interview was a rambling train wreck! You have really lost your friggin mind!!  Think you best lay off Mr. Biden as it just causes us to look at your mental state more closely.  You sound desperate and nutty! 🤪🤪
It's bizarro world where a Trump ad makes a good point about Joe Biden as a candidate.
in case anybody is wondering biden is gonna choose a running mate this week
Any reasonable candidate should be kicking Trump's ass in Swing States... yet here we are, with Biden barely holding a lead in most of them by only 2 points.
There *may* be times were voting 3rd party or similar (but NOT not voting as protest) is justifiable, but now is not one of them.   Biden and hopefully the Dems getting the House and Senate are the only chance of things getting better right now.
I don't like Biden or Harris, but as horrific as things are now, they only get much worse if Trump gets another term.   In my voting life I have gone back and forth on "vote strategically" vs "if you vote for the lesser of two evils nothing will change"...
She’s beside herself with joy over Kamala Harris. No, she’s not with joy, she IS Joy!  #BidenHarris2020 #BidenKamala2020 #Kamala #Biden #BidenHarris #KamalaHarris #ForThePeople #AMJoy #JOY
Biden shouldve picked Tulsi.
We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) take  +  to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
1 more thing: We progressives seem to so quickly forget #NotMeUs.  I wouldn't count on Biden or ANY VP pick to lead a progressive movement for change.  So, it's up to us to (a) Take Joe + Kamala to task on their past policies &amp; (b) create a movement where *we* lead &amp; they follow.
I'm all in for Biden-Harris for the obvious reason that Trump is a uniquely cruel and incompetent moron. But the fact that Republicans are already smearing these two standard liberals as "far left radicals" reveals how stupid it was to not elect *actually progressive* candidates.
harris was the safest bet for biden and it shows 🤧 no like no like no like
Finally. I had enough of him Biden his time.
This is a great choice!
The fact that you're still screeching "Both sides do it! Both sides do it! Raw-awk! Polly wanna cracker!" tells me all I need to know about how highly developed your perceptions of U.S. political culture are. Thinking that there's no difference between donald &amp; Joe Biden...? SMH
I try not to comment too much on politics in this Twitter account, but I can't remain silent here.POTUS is trying to gin up support by stoking racism. He is spewing sinophobic, fearmongering lies. This is not OK. We need to be better than this.  162 days.
Interesting Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate.  I need to ponder this.
and the team saw this coming months ago...
a biden and kamala democratic ticket?
I agree that he should not raid the Senate for Secretary of Commerce. I consider Biden’s VP to be the 2024 front runner, so I think it’s worth it in CA.
Oh, I see your point too, now. She could indeed work on cleaning up the lawlessness Trump has injected into the gov't.... Though the DOJ might be better for that... the optics of a WoC for VP are too important for Biden right now though
Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. Let's do this, and kick the orange bastard and his sycophantic second out of office in the biggest landslide in US history.
You sure about that? Biden has a wide lead, and Harris is popular. More than likely, Dumpy is shitting his pants right now.
Harris, a 55-year-old first-term senator, will be the first Black woman to compete on a major party's presidential ticket.
Biden makes his choice
2020 has gone in such a way that I'm fairly certain any moment I'm going to get a news alert that Biden chose Sarah Palin as his VP candidate.
Therefore they will never blame the cause bc they are the cause. Joe Biden will never back down from his bill that he made so why not hold him accountable for his sins that he caused unto black ppl.
So if Joe Biden HAS TO pick a black woman for veep, doesn't that mean Obama failed at being the first black president? Obama was supposed to be the savior of black America, I remember Jesse Jackson's tears of joy on that victory night in Chicago. Now look at Chicago.
Bc morning joe never speaks on the greedy truth of history. Think about how they discuss joe Biden as if he isn’t racist as if his pass doesn’t exist. Now I may not like trump but if your going to talk about somebody when you’re doing the same is called hypocritical bs
When I watch the white media I be having this sense of notion that they’re deflecting. How by using every little thing trump do to deflect the real racism that biden can’t keep coming out his mouth. I hear morning joe call trump ignorant of history this is rhetorical
The reason I keep bringing up democracy being white supremacy is bc what happens when the majority of the majority want you dead or enslaved  prison. You’ll get ppl like reagan Nixon Clinton Obama trump and Biden no matter which side you vote on ws is not only going to be there
Biden call blk ppl predators and the dems got blk women thinking that Biden is a match made in heaven smh. Wake up. Don’t be crazy and do the samething over and over again expecting different results.

Environmentalists are floating potential cabinet picks, hoping to pressure Biden to take on the fossil fuel industry.
Patriotic, devout are not positives. A bunch of the others pretty questionable terms to apply to Biden... still, a lot better than Trump, and what we have available at this point, so
Biden is going to pick a woman; that’s what he said. I assume he will also select his cabinet members and may introduce them all to us already. This way he will be able to hit the ground running should he win. Oh God, I can’t wait. Let it be!
Thank you! I hate to use this phrase, but “it is what it is.” I just have to go with the flow and hope that Biden wins and 45* gets kicked to the curb. It would give me hope again, which I’m utterly lacking since the 2016 election of the orange dicktator.
87% of Democrats support "Medicare for All," though Joe Biden doesn't

I’m having a hard time today... I just can’t anymore with 45*’s and the GOP’s lies, especially regarding Joe Biden and the democrats. I know he’s projecting and desperate, but enough is enough.
Sylvie,Biden apologizes bc, even at his age and his many years as a prominent leader, he is human, therefore fallible, and is willing to both learn and embrace the changes his behavior requires. I’d rather have an honest penitent than an irresponsible and unapologetic nincompoop.

Lol he was QUOTING the mayor of New Orleans in 1985. The mayor of NOLA was a mean racist ans congress (with joe Biden) told him to piss off. So no he did not say that , troll
Any white person who turns away from Biden for choosing a Black woman as VP is racist. This election requires a Black VP female candidate. The strength and dedication of Black women is needed by our country.
trump can’t keep his bullshit straight. One day, Biden is a senile old man who can barely stand. The next day, Biden is destroying the Almighty and the Bible. Which is it?I like how this is the go to republican attack, heard it about Bernie, heard it about Warren. Now onto Biden....

Umm we’re already a laughingstock because of you. When Biden wins, we’ll prove to the world that America has some decency and compassion
The dogwhistles have become klaxons because they pretty much have nothing else. Biden/Harris is Republican Lite. How the fuck do you attack their policy ideas and have it come across as being in good faith? Everybody and their grandma knows this isn't a Bernie/Warren ticket.
Trump was attacking Warren for years. He saw her as a guaranteed opponent. Rice had built-in Obama baggage. Neither wound up on the ticket at all, and I think that's left them a bit scrambly.  They knew it'd be Biden, but they're acting like this ticket was out of nowhere.
don't get me wrong the same would be true of many other possible choices, but like, it seems to me they had a whole fucking gameplan for Warren or Rice and didn't think Biden/Harris was a real thing for some reason
I’m glad Biden is speaking plainly about this.
Biden just lost the election.
Good morning Erica/ everyone. I’m still celebrating Harris and Biden. I’m hoping next term. She can run for president it’s time  for change. Conservatives should just move to an island. I love kamala ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Every single one of these is a free campaign ad for Biden/Harris.

That’s billshit and you know it. This isn’t even Joe Biden tweeting. We’ve got your number.
Good lord! You’re tds is really out of hand. If you actually care about joe Biden, the person, the humane thing would be for him to step down.  Why is his family humiliating him like this?
Does it really matter? Trump is the President today. He has to run on HIS record. Biden is his opponent. He has to answer for some but not all of the Obama administration. If Trump could manage to NOT LIE we might have a real contest! But, Trump just can’t keep from lying! SAD!!!
Why, what are you trying to hide, Mr Kristol? If Biden is not mentally or cognitively able to do something as simple as have a debate, the American people deserve to know about it before the elections.
biden said desegregation would result in a "racial jungle" and kamala tried to keep people imprisoned longer to use them for cheap labor. so you've got a segregationalist rapist and a transphobic cop who supports prison slavery
hey, how much time have you spent canvassing or making calls for biden? if you want him to win so badly, maybe you should do something about it? or do you just treat politics like a team sport that you spectate?
You own daughter is voting for Biden/Harris, loser.
I bet video editing is a hit job in both Trump campaign and Joe Biden‘s campaign. Seriously it’s true.
yes but have you heard about the biden plan?
Look at the statement by Biden. He stated Trump said they (white supremacists) were "very fine people." That is absolutely not true. Even Jake Tapper said it isn't true. You may want to listen to the entire Trump statement before making that reference.
This isn't about Obama/Biden. They handled it so well that we didn't need masks, etc. Sit down &amp; shut up.
There's something truly exceptional about the idea that a Harris/Biden presidency would be worse for whites than Adelson/Trump. Private prison operators don't care about the Color of Convicts. They probably prefer less troublesome whites, all told.
“Biden bro” is absolutely perfect and beautifully ironic, imma start using that
As you may be able to tell, I'm not exactly jazzed about Biden either
I bet Biden-Harris are very dependent on the age bracket 18-24 yr olds if they want even the slimmest of chances to win...
Oh yes. I actually listened. It was a *trip*--especially after the coherent, non-crazy Biden-Harris event.
Definitely voting Biden/Harris ticket!

As I jam out to  before the Biden/Harris live stream, I think about how republicans have next to zero iconic music they can use because everyone hates them and I laugh and laugh. #DoYouBelieveInLifeAfterLove
He can talk to Biden and fix it w/o airing dirty laundry publically. Solutions, not griping! We need to shed light on all minorities that are underrepresented, 💯 agree. Shaming on twitter doesn’t seem like the way to do that, IMO.
When climate activists who know damn well that Biden/Harris means another decade without meaningful climate legislation are talking about the music choice for their press conference, any hope for real change is dead. Gone. Buried and eaten by worms already.
January bullshit: Toxic Twitter fans But we'll be labeled as far-left He and Warren are OVER  August reality: KHive VP Biden is labeled socialist Articles talking about Biden debating Warren as if Bernie's first choice for VP wasn't always Warren  Good job everyone, you killed us
1. I don't believe Warren was a real consideration  2. I don't believe Biden would make his choice based on a gaffe  3. It doesn't matter either way. It's not like Warren VP = Biden pro-M4A.  It's Nazi vs. Republican Lite. That's the choice. It was always going to be this.
Oh and Biden/Harris is coming for ya
Not sure if I’m more annoyed that the DNC chose Biden over Bernie/the other options. Or that Biden chose Kamala over the other options. 😔

These idiot republicans will bitch and moan because Biden will be forced to raise taxes. He should raise them only on the wealthy and corporations. Repeal the tax deal.
#KamalaHarrisForVP #KamalaHarris First smart decision made by Biden. I hope it’s the start of an ever climbing trend of his.
What? Deliberate mistreatment of white/H*sp**ic kids to make certain other groups look better? But I thought this would only happen under the Biden plan, not under Trump in Republican Florida? NOOOOOOOO #KAGA #MAGA #WWG1WGA #PromisesMadePromisesKept #StormisuponUS
JFC. Joe Biden really can't get over this "You ain't black" schtick, can he? In this case, "You ain't black (ADOS)"
please note Biden picked an attack dog running mate. Beware of off the cuff televised comments. Repercussions can be legal actions. No simple approach. Biden is the candidate, she is riding the shirt tail
I hear y'all but at some point there is a lesser of two evils. Biden might not make all of the changes we hope to see but anything is better than the motherfucker in there now. The house is already blue and the senate probably will be too. Change has to start somewhere
😅😅😂😂🤣😂😆Here we go again😅😆😂😆😂😂😂😂😆😆😅😂😆Russia, give it up. It worked once, but REAL, TRUE Americans aren’t buying it this time!🤣😆😆😅😆🤣🤣Fuck you.😅🤣🤣😅President Biden won’t be “Putin” America first, like your puppet did.  Fear Biden like you feared Obama!
Great Wall fucktard, (as long as the wind doesn’t blow!)  Mexico want’s it finished too, so people from this “shit-hole” country can’t get in their country! How embarrassing is that!  Make America great again! 😆😆😂🤣😆😆🤣🤣😅🤣🤣😆 Let’s leave that up to Biden &amp; Harris!
you bring new hope and promise for the future. Future POTUS Biden made an excellent choice!

This is what getting ratioed looks like. Also, who knew that Linds would be stumping for Biden/Harris? So good!
Look! Linds is stumping for Biden/Harris now! Hahaha!
This ad is so funny! The name- calling 4th grade bully for Pres? No thanks! I Love the Biden/Harris 2020 ticket!
Absolutely John. You are a great man that fought for our freedom. You shall always be loved me my dear friend. You are an actual hero that fought. I’m proud to call you my. You fought for all of us. So proud you stand with Biden and Harris. You are a great man .👍
Soooo, you aren’t working with Russia to make a nothing burger about Hunter Biden? Oh wait, you ARE comrade. #TraitorGOP
Trump says if Joe Biden wins election you have to study Chinese😂 you are way ahead of them.
Color me shocked—you are blatantly trying to get your racist followers to vote for Mr. Biden now?
I absolutely agree 199% Erica. It’s time for change. The past will never end with out new direction. The rightest conservatives like old fashion values. In fact even before women’s rights to vote. They don’t like change.. time to change everything. Biden/ Harris 2020😀👍
You don’t know that. For those that love  and I contributed to her campaign, our goal should be to get her elected as senate majority leader and replace Schumer. Then her platform is Independant of Biden....
“I need someone working alongside me who is smart, tough, and ready to lead. Kamala is that person,” - Joe Biden
Willie Brown who has an affair with her advised Biden not to pick her. She was 29 at the time while Brown was in his 60s.
What’s your point?  I love the fact she wants to save the planet.  Biden will replace lost jobs with green jobs.  So, no worries.
I agree. I wish Biden &amp; Harris well; they're brave souls. I'm in shock as to where America is today. The fascists are here &amp; well integrated, it would seem.  PDX was a trial. I think PDX won.  trump withdrew w/o a problem. It was a battle; they aren't finished.  I'm proud of PDX
Yes those voters definitely will be turned off. Biden probably chose her because her past would be well received by independents/moderates who are unsure of progressive policies but don’t want Trump. They expect those angry on the left to still vote for Biden
I’m very happy with the pick. She’s young with experience. I really think the pick was based on change. I’m really happy. Great pick joe. Let’s put Trump and his scared of trump little man pence to rest. Horrible leadership. Biden /Harris want change. Conservatives.. new times.
I was really hoping for her to take the AG post. But she'll be great no matter what she does. Any bets on who Biden will choose for AG? Maybe Sally Yates?
Honest question. Do you think the Biden choice of Harris as his VP this will strengthen down ballot chances in the senate?
A tool in the service of White Wellbeing is never illegitimate.  Vote Biden/Harris for what they will do.     #MAGA #GoingFree #Biden2020 #Harris2024
Biden-Harris in 2020!! I'm so excited to vote for the Democratic ticket again!
Oh no doubt about that. I think she is a solid choice (in general) for VP, although I expected her to be the main choice for AG for a Biden administration
congratulations!  What a great pick.  You two will make a great team.  Haven’t been this happy in a long time.  Biden and you give me hope for the country.  Nice job Joe!
MANY, MANY!  There will be a place for them in the Biden/Harris cabinet.  Their talents will be needed to clean up trump's aftermath.  They'll gain more experience and run for POTUS in the future!  (women age better than men, so we have a LONG list.  LOL)
I couldn’t be any happier. We have a fighting chance to end all this madness and division of the trump clan. So tired of trump saying the virus will go away. I want to hear facts. Biden/ Harris 2020. Very proud and hopeful. Let’s get this moron out.
What do I want to see in a Biden/Harris presidency? -COVID19 eradication -Respect for the science/research -Aid for struggling Americans -Aid for schools &amp; teachers -Tear down that damn Wall! -Release the children in cages -No more lies, no more bullshit -Women are human beings.
I hate Joe Biden and I hate Kamala Harris and I hate that there's a fucking Nazi in power that makes Joe Biden look remotely decent by comparison and I hate having to vote for abusers to get rid of abusers and I hate the Republican party and I hate billionaires and I hate cops.
There will be changes.  We have to have our ppl positioned &amp; that's what we get w Biden/Harris.  ...&amp; there is a great team w them... Warren, Porter, Rice, Abrams, , THIS is our year!  The GOP will fight dirty &amp; ugly.  We keep our heads high &amp; don't cave &amp; we'll win!

People are excited about Kamala Harris joining Biden? Couldn’t be me tf
Biden's store server has crashed so not everyone is disappointed it seems. Don't let your echo chamber get you down.
I'm very happy for  As much as I wish to have seen her as an amazing AG, she'll do an outstanding job as VP. I'm sure most of Biden's former Dem opponents will have seats in his cabinet. Here's to dumping  and his criminal administration.
It was inevitable when Klobuchar pulled out. I wouldn't be surprised if Biden decided then and decided to string us all along for a bit.
A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for the prison and military industrial complex, marijuana staying criminalized, militarized police and a shitty healthcare Don’t let anyone shame you for not voting for this centrist republican

Biden taps Kamala Harris as running mate, setting aside tensions from primary
How do y’all feel about Kamala Harris being Biden’s pick for VP ?
Toaster\ orange juice. I despise Biden and Harris but at least the have an IQ higher than 14. Once in a while Harris does the right thing.
Seeing a lot of the expected backlash, but I'll say it again: if Harris on the ticket gets #MedicareForAll on the platform, the margin of victory for Biden is going to be absurd.
KAMALA it is!!!   Biden/Harris - a winning ticket!!
She's well-positioned to help Biden advocate firm law enforcement.
every person on the left right now is writing some version of this joke:  the people: we need health care, climate change is a beeotch, fuck these cops  joe biden: tbd on health care, we'll see about climate change, here's kamala to tell you why cops are dope
Congratulations  Kamala Harris will be the first Black woman nominated for vice president by a major party  via
What if Biden picks a woman for whom you have little fondness?
Biden/Harris? Ugh whatever. Better than Condoleezza Rice. Let’s just get this shitshow over with already
She’ll have Bill Barr’s head on a platter in to time! Great choice “President Joe Biden!”
If it means that Joe Biden is are next president and Trump and his criminal administration and their cronies are out and in jail, I would be happy to pay 98% in taxes.
like Biden's choice of Kamala Harris for VP. A LOT.  I can't wait for her to take it Trump and Pence. I know she has some baggage - all candidates (all people) do - but she'll make a great VP and would be a great president.
Well, he picked one of the few people on the list who supports SOME kind of Medicare For All, and he picked someone who won't bring built-in GOP Smear Machine ammunition.  I'm pleasantly surprised Biden didn't fuck that up.
Huge- finally- it is Kamala for VP. Biden tweeted it!
Biden can choose Nichols if he looks to reach out to Republicans; Saira Rao if he decides he needs to excite the woke crowd.
I like that ticket about equally as much as Biden/Duckworth. I think Tammy would be the better VP but Harris would be the better political choice and can definitely grow to fit the role.
I'm so tired of this VP edition of the bachelorette. Unless Biden 1) chooses Warren and then 2) dies I don't caaaaaaaaaaaaare
Biden should pick  for vp.
Biden has picked a female running mate.  Excited ......
Why not? All partners get a chance to make a speech. Jill Biden is quite an amazing woman.
Biden will be there on the last night, as most nominees do.
I did!   Chip in to elect Joe Biden
Joe has hairy legs! Joe Biden! You know the thing! Come on man!
Apparently Joe Biden is a fucking victim now. What did he ever do to you? I mean aside from rape, imprison, drone strike, bomb, rob, shoot, shackle, &amp;/or spy on you. Those are all lifestyle choices. Joe self-identifies as a political forest fire &amp; he needs a safe space to burn in
And when the woke are pulling Joe Biden’s strings, Israel and Jews will get screwed.
Is the magic money tree in Joe Biden’s basement?
“Advance liberal causes” your bio says. Dissing Biden’s possible choices does opposite. Many candidates have stocks and sit on boards that they divest themselves from when/if elected. This reporting earns you a block from this longtime liberal.
I know a lot of Biden voters who are so “excited” to vote they have had trouble sleeping for 3 years.
Biden wouldn't run away like #BunkerBitch did.
Newsflash: no matter what he did or didn’t do- Hunter Biden is NOT running for potus. But, If you want to pit Biden kids vs Trump’s grown kids, game on!

Apparently, you didn't see him riding a bike yesterday. He's out-and-about. He just doesn't hold stupid 'press conferences/rallies' all the time at a golf club. Biden exercises, whereas tRump* just gets in and out of a golf cart.
I disagree. She doesn’t regret what she did as a Bush staffer.  What I respect is her ability to use her inside knowledge of actual proper White House activity and contrast it with today’s chaos. She tells it like it is. Geo. Wills left the GOP and is voting for Biden. It’s ok!
I agree. My car would get keyed or set afire out driving in rural areas. But I do have a “In my America love wins... “ yard sign on my driveway and so do my lovely neighbors. We will all have Biden signs on our road in Fall.
Anthony Scaramucci is an obnoxious Never Trumper Republican who is supporting Joe Biden yet denies Joe Biden will do any of the things in the Democrat platform. So delusional!
I was just saying kind of opposite to my spouse. I see stupid-big trucks w/ huge trump flags and merch flying down street. I never see the sensible Dems do that for Biden. But that is a good thing. They are activists not maniacs.
so literally every single thing they're saying about biden is what they'd have said about bernie only we'd get all the good policy ok cool just checking
so, IMHO, the best we can hope for from electoral politics is Biden picks Kamala Harris and maybe one day comes around to adopting some whittled-down final bill based on her sorta-Medicare for All plan  lol it's not as bad as him picking Hillary I guess?
It's worth pointing out that Whitmer met with Biden in-person a week ago. While Rice has been all over the media lately, Kamala has been Biden's BFF and Duckworth is quite popular among the pundits, Whitmer is flying in under the radar.
I think Bass is eliminated based on the Scientology video's bad optics + the reluctance of the Biden campaign to do anything to please progressives (many have urged him to pick her).  Warren &amp; Clinton I rule out because they're announced already for the night the VP pick speaks.
so with that, I'm predicting it now:  Elizabeth Warren is not going to be Joe Biden's VP.
the two people announced as speakers on the night announced as "the night Joe Biden's VP pick addresses the nation" are Warren and Hillary Clinton  the most likely scenario is it is neither one of those two women.  if it is, would you REALLY expect him to pick Warren?
the Axios article gives me reason to believe that there is absolutely no way that Elizabeth Warren is going to be Joe Biden's VP pick
MSNBC needs to STFU about the Biden Campaign being "late" to pick a VP! VP picks usually don't happen until the convention so just fucking stop it!
I'm gonna beat joe biden.mp4
Warren and Clinton are confirmed to be speaking next Wednesday.  That's the night Biden's VP addresses the nation.  I have a feeling it's neither of them, but if it is? Lord.
If this is accurate it is difficult to understand the ignorance of the electorate regarding the current issues. This seems to be entirely the influence of the mainstream fake news media - Trump is bad, hydroxychloroquine kills, Biden is smart, the Green New Deal is good. WRONG!
Oh, do you mean how you are openly working with Russia to spread misinformation (lies) about your FRIEND Joe Biden, while having your head residing in Trump’s colon???
It's the other way around. tRump* can't handle a debate. He can't handle the truth. Biden is fine. Some people confuse his stuttering for mental decline....which it is not. He has had to deal with stuttering his entire life.
It’s also funny (and by funny I mean sickening) listening to middle aged democrats telling a young WOC (&amp; survivor) that she’s supposed to ignore all this damning evidence about Joe Biden because “the other guy’s worse and if you don’t vote for him, you’re electing Trump”
Joe Biden is so fucking creepy and incompetent and corrupt I just honestly don’t know if I can vote him still. I probably will, but this is the man who said he would VETO MEDICARE FOR ALL EVEN IF THE HOUSE AND SENATE PASSED IT!! In the middle of a pandemic.
-Steal the election by making it safe to vote? We have vote-by-mail in Oregon, and it works. No fraud. -Honey, EVERYONE endorses Biden. -Black Lives Matter &amp; Pelosi are not Marxists. -A Patriot is someone who will help get that POS out of the People's House.   Stop with the lies.
hate to break it to the liberals but donald trump isn't going to wilt at the sight of the majesty of joe biden's flex pose
Who tf is Biden’s running mate gonna be?! He said he would announce it the first week of August. Well....it’s now into the second week #Biden 🤔 COME ON ALREADY!
That's your misfortune. Most of us are going to vote that jackass out before he totally destroys everything we hold dear in this country. Joe Biden struggled with a stuttering problem his entire life. Don't be a Donald and make fun of him.

😂👍.... Yes! Love him or hate him, President Trump composes his own tweet. Joe Biden, not so much...
"see he did come around on this"  now just cue the Biden scandal
Joe Biden may be our first president chosen by affirmative action. No one would give even half a fuck about the old racist if he didn't faintly smell of Obama, and Obama only picked him for VP to be his designated token white geezer to chill the Clintonites.
Man, Biden and Trump on The Portal, or the Rubin Report, that would be incredible.
The Republican parry has effectively convinced half of America that democrats are socialists, when in reality most democrats are centrists. Obama, Hillary, and Biden are all centrist/moderates who have been called socialists and leftists. People have no idea what leftist means
And I don’t want to hear any of this “bring the country together” bullshit from Biden. I WANT PROSECUTIONS!
We are not done!  We need to be proactive by talking to friends and family about why voting for Biden is so important and actually CASTING OUR VOTE is crucial for the future of our country. Volunteer for local campaigns, phone banks, and you will make a difference! We can win!
Looks like it was all progressives asking Biden to pick Bass so I'm ruling her out
The president has also said we should "look into" using sunlight internally to combat C-19, and that Biden will "hurt God". He retweets video from "doctors" who believe endometriosis is caused by having sex with demons in your sleep, and made up an invitation from the Yankees.
I really hope they don't shaft Biden if Trump loses. He literally gave up his last couple of years of functionality. I disagree with his belief that it was necessary to save the republic, but that sacrifice should be recognized regardless.
US officials: Russia denigrating Biden ahead of election #SmartNews
Last night I asked my dad if Trump could do ANYTHING that would disturb him enough to stop supporting the maniac &amp; his answer was, “no, not if that means a vote for Biden.”  Guys, that’s fucking horrifying. Fear tactics work. Trump supporters will stand by him “no matter what...”
Maine for Biden, and Sara Gideon!
who does biden pick for vp
Funny to think that there is literally no positive reason to vote for Joe Biden. The only good reason to vote for Biden is that Trump is a duplicitous s**tbird who has followed through on none of his campaign promises, and if you don't punish that you will simply get more of it.
What comes out of Biden's mouth and what comes at a trump's mouth, Are not even comparable Anyone's allowed to make a mistake long as they corrected trump never does his mistakes are intentional
Well Jimmy Carter is deeply religious but ran keeping it out of politics. Biden can/does too!
All Biden need say, “I am catholic and I only discuss it w/ my God. I believe in separating church and state.” THE END. We really want to have a religion pissing match in our presidential election?
Antifa doesn’t care who is in power! They want destruction! They want the end of the US. If Biden wins it won’t stop them they will be empowered! And he won’t do anything to stop them! Our only chance is a Trump win &amp; hopefully control of the senate &amp; congress!
Joe Biden is the perfect personification of what ails the Catholic Church today.
Biden is pro-choice.
I think Andrea Mitchell didn't reread her tweet before posting. But Obama is helping advise Biden. btw, Obama has no desire for another term. He's happy where he is.
I think we need to start ranking your lies.  This would rank with the top 10.  Keep trying to find a way to discredit Biden.  Maybe you could try for 30,000 missing emails.  That worked last time.

Suburbia, Portland, Oregon.  What isn't burnt, trashed, or ruined, doesn't have a Biden sign here either. And this is Bernie-land.
How come when Joe Biden tweets to clarify his horrific racist comments he sounds totally different than when he talks. It's as if a different person is tweeting for him. Weird.
The Biden comment today pretty much covers what he thinks of the black community. I know his people tried to cover for him but he has said shit like this for years.
Panel rejects Donald Trump's request to add a fourth debate with Joe Biden  via
Only the first one was racist. The other two are taken out of context.  The Latin comment was about the various countries they come from (Latin America) which isn’t the case for many black Americans DUE TO SLAVERY.  Biden saying Americans are racist against Asians isn’t racist.
I feel we as a party need to be more pragmatic  and less puritanical. Biden's not perfect. Harris is not perfect, but they're who we got and they're better than the incumbent. Simple as that.
Your party's candidate just today said that african americans have no diversity. At least fox news reports that. Your socialist news channels like msdnc won't even report that biden literally said that in an interview

Well gosh, this is happening under trump’s watch, not Obama’s or Biden’s.  So what’s your point?
He could have mentioned it SOONER. He lied saying that Obama didn't leave a playbook. But it was proven Obama/Biden did leave one. He never shut the country down. He wanted to open it back up.
Yeah Trump says Biden will destroy God. We can't have that.
Joe Biden loves black people so much, he just wants to give them a big old 9 minute bear hug right around the neck.
Biden hasn’t been to mass since the 70s. Not sure that makes him a devout Catholic.
Yeah ask Biden/Obama about that!
What a leader looks like—Joe Biden!
That is absolute BS.  In fact, Biden has pledged to increase funding to police.  Secondly, no one is taking all the guns in America.  QUIT LYING! #AmericasGreatestMistake
More scare tactics. Republicans have been using that same tired "threat" for decades. If Biden was going to take people guns away, didn't he have an 8 year span (recently even) when he could've done that?
Don’t be this white woman. Just don’t. You vote for Joe Biden, or you own every piece of trump. Very few things are black and white. This? This is absolutely one of them. You have the ability to prove you’re not a fascist and all it takes is voting for Biden. At all costs.
Gotta run it through some polls and who is willing to keep the Biden secrets of his cognitive abilities, Hunters money acquisitions from Ukraine and China. So much to agree to in order to be the future President. I mean VP
Yeah they're two old guys who say stupid shit, but one is a goddamn racist and fascist who will continue to sell us out to line his own pockets and the other is Joe Biden.Biden for President!!! We need a real President that will know what he is doing. A humble man and not an arrogant man!!! A gentleman and not an asshole!!!
Strong evidence indicates that both Biden and Trump are racist. However, there are degrees of racism. Biden is at least in good part a multi-cultural liberal, like selecting Kamala. Trump has projected the Central Park 5 and Obama as a black threat.
I am very concerned. Social Security is the institutional manifestation of our America being a community. Biden-Harris is the ticket
#TheNewNewFrontier As Biden said the other day, our America's promise can be summed up in one word: possibilities. Standing on the shoulders of our venerable ancestors, amazing things are possible for us. Let us doggedly pursue the American dream
Problem is I don’t trust information we are getting from postal union supporting Biden and I don’t trust Trump administration.
Swallow your craziness and vote for Biden or kiss everything goodbye...
NOBODY is as awful as Trump says they are. Biden is not as bad as Republicans say he is. Trump is far worse than Republicans will admit he is.
Yep. Guiliani is getting clowned publicly by his daughter too. She supports Biden-Harris &amp; wants everyone to know it...including Rudy.
Apparently Biden is smarter than the people that vote for him!?!
Trump is trying to kill us. Biden and Kamala are trying to save us.
President Trump attacks Joe Biden for calling governors to mandate all Americans wear masks for the next three months, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of politicizing an issue Trump himself has used for political gain in recent months.
I'm a boomer, so I remember a long way back. Biden &amp; Harris aren't perfect candidates, nobody is. But they are SO MUCH  BETTER than Trump and Pence, it is hard to believe anyone with brains would even consider not voting for them.
2/2 “During the campaign and, if they win, during a Biden-Harris administration, Ms. Harris’s staff hiring would be approved by Mr. Biden.”
“1/2 “potential for conflict between Biden &amp; Harris advisers was resolved ....at least for now: Mr. Biden and his advisers made plain to Ms. Harris that they expected to have the same understanding with respect to staff hiring that Mr. Biden had followed with” Obama.
“Biden advisers made clear that selecting Ms. Harris for the vice presidency did not mean selecting her full political entourage for jobs in the campaign or government. That rule would apply, Ms. Harris was told, even to her sister, Maya ...a former Hillary ... adviser”
“There was a particular distrust in the Biden camp for the sharp-elbowed California operatives with whom Ms. Harris has long surrounded herself, fearing that they might seek to undermine Mr. Biden in office to clear the way for Ms. Harris in 2024.”
The Biden camp is so distrustful of Harris they told her she couldn’t bring her staff or sister to the campaign.
Biden and Kamala are just the team for the job.
You haven't fought for the people in decades all you care about are your donors that;'s why you screwed Bernie twice never Biden.

Joe Biden raised $26MIL in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate, doubling his previous one-day record and signaling enthusiasm among Democrats following the selection of the first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket.
Hillary warned us in a calm rational voice and the deplorable wanted trump. Biden, someone with a penis, is also warning us. Do we really think it will make a difference?

Live in Oregon where we all vote by mail. If I think Trump is disrupting  voting  through manipulating the Post Office I will hand carry my ballot to the drop box at the county elections department and it will be a vote for Biden!
Me, my three daughters, my mom and sister who have always voted republican without fail... my republican dad and independent husband and sons in law... we are ALL voting for Biden/Harris because we are sick and tired of being embarrassed by our Divider in chief and grifter pres.
Biden has always been a nothing burger. Harris was never very popular,  look how poorly she did in the primaries.
You know what's worse than Joe Biden picking Kamalia Harris has vice president. Having Trump has president
He’s campaigning for Biden now?
If Biden wins, the Harris people will leak to the press every Biden slip or stumble to encourage him to step down! You think the Trump folks are bad!
It will be fun during the campaign and after’ if Biden wins, watching the tension between the Biden and Harris camps!
If I was Joe  Biden I would worry about Harris! She will not have his back!
I see professing evangelicals being willing to vote Biden/Harris motivated primarily by anti-racism.   Here's my question: is the phrase "single-issue voting" only applicable to one set of issues and not others?
Biden yes, Harris no!
Pandemic Diary Day 149: Biden Makes History With VP Pick - Kamala Harris  #nastywoman
I think, Marc, the reasoning you used to decide to vote for Biden was sound. There are amazing things brewing; Biden has heard the liberal word and has promised to be 'the most progressive President since F.D.R..' You could be undecided for a bit.
Fox News Host Neil Cavuto Corrects Trump Campaign: Kamala Harris Never Called Biden ‘Racist’
Joe Biden cannot even pick out his socks!  WTH?  Don’t you just keep shaking your head in disbelief? Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The VP pick well not massage a break a nominee. But if something happens to Biden god forbid we will have a woman as president and that would be amazing.
Is that the Mooch in the phone reflection?  AS? To the right of  Biden? That might be what is so bad.
My first pic as well, I was wishing and hoping and sending Joe Biden my wish!  What a ticket I am so Excited!!
#KamalaHarris makes American history today as Joe Biden's selection for Vice President of the United States.
Yeah no. Harris and Biden both can be placed center right for sure.
“I’m honored to join Joe Biden in the fight for the soul of our country” by Kamala Harris
Nope.  We are going to get charges of sleaze 24/7 because of this horrible candidate with a Titanic full of baggage.  If Biden had been running against anybody other than Trump, Harris would ruin his chances.  She is a lousy candidate.
If Biden were running against anybody but Trump, his choice of Kamala Harris would be fatal to his chances.  She is that poor a choice.  We are going to get charges of cronyism 24/7, and nobody will have to make it up.  #KamalaHarris #JoeBiden
Congratulations,  We're so proud of you and happy you've been officially selected as Joe Biden's running mate!
So...Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Just when we thought 2020 couldn't get weirder.  My political commentary for the year is now complete...
Joe Biden named California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate on Tuesday.
"There are three people on this ticket, so it is a bit crowded."  What a terrible choice Biden made with Kamala Harris.  The Willie Brown thing is going to tear the ticket apart.
Biden picked Harris because he  A: is trying to convince us he’s not racist. B: wants the “top cop” to prevent any defunding on a federal level. If he wins then dies and she’s the president, I won’t complain as much because we desperately need feminine energy in the White House.
Only reason I would’ve voted for Biden is for Kamala! Let’s fucking goooo!
The pac-12 cancelled football BUT Biden chode Kamala. I’m conflicted...
BREAKING: Presidential hopeful Joe Biden has selected Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.

BREAKING: Joe Biden’s running mate is in! #PoliticalNews
#breaking: Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate. #BidenVP
Biden’s best strategy:  play Rope-a-Dope with Trump.
Specially if Susan Rice is going to be Biden’s mate.
During the 2008 primary, Biden expressed surprise that Obama was 'clean,' being black and all. Sure Biden's a racist. There's a lot of racist sentiment in the U.S.. I've had black friends characterized by industry and other good qualities. But I have some prejudice in my psyche
What if Joe Biden just... never announces a VP?... Just frickin cowboys it, you know?  #DelawareStyle
Mayor Pete back in the news! He should be Secretary of State or UN Ambassador in the Biden Administration.  Nothing but respect for my guy.
Bill hicks still liked little girls and biden still sniffed little girls. Nothing you can say or do will change that. Yet you still cherish that 2 bit comedian so much that you claim his name sake. Sick!
BIGLY NEWS!  Chris Christie may play Biden in Trump's debate prep  first, he has to go on a diet, and then ride a bicycle like Joe did this weekend!
Interesting read.   The biggest #threat 2 the #GOP's #survival isn't #Biden, #VoterFraud, or even #tRUMP himself. It's the reality that the American #electorate is becoming more #racially &amp; #EthnicallyDiverse, more #urban, &amp; more likely not born in the #US.
Do we mention Biden likes to sniff little girls?
Joe Biden will now pick Papa Shango as his running mate.
The real reason is because Biden might think she died because the wrestler Kamala passed away today.
The Guardian, Really? Okay, You got me I'm totally gonna vote for Biden now even though he does like to smell children, is corrupt, involved in selling our country out to the communists like china, sounds like a racist and involved in U1. If only I had known this sooner.🤣
Now that Kamala has died.  Joe Biden to pick Papa Shango as his running mate. #RIPKamala
I did hear that Biden has Swastika tattoo. He had it done in ancient Sumeria when it symbolized the powers of nature.
...Or raping 13 year old girls. Not once has anyone accused Biden of kiddie rape, but court documents accuse Trump and Epstein.  You’re an amadán.
You mean they let Joe out of the basement for once. Did someone at least warn the alter boys and little girls. Who do you think sniffed  more children today, Trump or Biden? I know, Stupid question. We all know.
Saw your statement today that Biden will be impeached as soon as voted in. Going to be hard since you will no longer control the Senate. You are so out of touch you are totally ineffectual. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Biden boat parade!
Was looking for a Biden boat. Found it!
Biden is just like you, corrupt and secretly racist, but at least he has enough intelligence to go with the emerging liberal zeitgeist now. The American people are not going to tolerate more restriction and austerity; At long last it is time to ask what our country can do for us.
Swing Voters Still Prefer Trump Over Biden  via  Ring of Fire Network
I agree he is pulling out all the stops at a last ditch effort to try to gain some support that the pos has lost to  Biden
If Biden takes a cognitive test it will be rigged and he will pass with flying colors, there is no end to demorat corruption.
If he's elected, Biden will have a once in a lifetime opportunity to take America to the next level, to meet with achievement the bold promise of this new world. The time calls for an F.D.R., a moderate soul in the service of the people
Biden campaign says no VP pick yet after bike trail quip | TheHill
Democratic social aid programs are investing in this country's economy. Social aid boosts that consumer spending all our markets and enterprises rely on- and a Biden presidency would see Rooseveltian public aid &amp; investment
So, the fix is in. When Biden steps down due to mental incapacity, Whitmer assumes the Presidency and enforces a regime of mandatory vaccinations.
Lol it’s crazy to be so educated yet so ill informed and ignorant. If you don’t know about Biden’s policies yet, you’ve just been letting the TV tell you what to think my dude. Good luck with that mindset.
You're the media too, Ben.  How do you feel about Trump tweeting that Biden isn't "worthy of the black vote"?  By your logic, if you don't call them out, you are equally as hypocritical.   *Sips out of conservative tears mug*
Biden has no code. He doesn't know his own history, much less the history of Black people in America. To him, we are all just minorities to be tolerated in a nation established by whites for the benefit of whites. He recognizes the demographic shift is influencing politics, tho.
Men have been at the helm of the ship of state since we've been a nation. Biden will pick a woman as Vice President. I hope he decides his age would preclude him from serving a second term. It's time for a woman to right this ship!
As with many people Biden wasn't my first choice for a presidential candidate. Or my second. Or my third. But I'd rather have him and a competent administration rather than this corrupt mob boss regime we have now. Biden has my vote. Trump and the GOP need to be run out of office
Kanye West Implies His Presidential Campaign Is Intentionally Trying to Hurt Biden’s Chances
Still waiting for Trump to say something about the intelligence reports that described Russia promoting Trump and attacking Biden...  heck, I'd even settle for a few words on China and Iran's attempts at disrupting the 2020 election  Crickets
I see him hurting Trump more than Biden as only crazy, ignorant people would vote for Kanye or Trump.
I’m kinda white I’m definitely voting Biden. It should be a no brainer no matter your race creed or religion.  #ripjohnlewis honer him VOTE #VOTEBIDEN
My former dad did that a lot. Beat my mom for what he was doing. So I am very familiar with what Trump is doing.  Sooo.. Trump for prison 2020. And Biden for president 2020.
Are you saying you’ll vote for 45 if you don’t like Biden’s veep pick? Asking for myself.
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. More lies. You literally don't have a clue what Biden will do. All you know is YOU'RE LOSING. Might have something to do with the crappy job you have done as President. November 3Rd we will MAGA without you. #ByeDon2020
Biden draws distinction on Black, Latino political diversity
Virginia Mayor Who Said Joe Biden 'Announced Aunt Jemima As His VP Pick,' Saw Nothing Wrong With His Racist Remark (and apparently he felt comfortable enough with his network of friends &amp; family to put it on Facebook).
Trump: “Biden is weak”  Also Trump: “Biden will hurt God. “  “...”
Schrodinger’s Biden: simultaneously weak and able to hurt god almighty.
political event where he slams Biden, lies about the corona virus and ALL on the taxpayer's dime!
Schrodinger’s Biden: simultaneously weak and feeble but able to damage an omnipotent God. #TrumpIsALaughingStock #ImpotusAmericanus #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden
#Thighland ... because he used too many technical words in a row.
It speaks very ill of Biden that the only way Trump can even try to differentiate himself from Biden is to lie.
No matter who he picks. Biden is a smart man he’ll pick a good running mate. Obama picked him. Pray this will be over soon
You are sickening trump. You are showing your desperation you’ll say anything to try to win back so many of voters turning to Biden. They see you for what you are. Antichrist
Biden was the first Catholic VP in US history.  Catholics make up a quarter of American voters (think Hispanic vote, amongst others). Once again, Trump is all about projection - he's the one without religion and more to the point, without a soul.So if it was Biden, it would not be a problem right?
Biden isn’t Catholic..he excommunicated himself by his actions on abortion
Why won't you press Harris or Biden? They won't answer any questions at so called press conferences.  Here's your opportunity to shine.🤡
Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro
Never get tired of that GIF. 😆
Will Kamala Harris help Joe Biden's bid for the White House?
Joe biden is a fucking moron. Im not even rock hard for singlepayer but he makes a TERRIBLE case for insurance tied to employment. He's a fucking idiot. Gonna be hard to vote for him
"REVENGE IS MINE" sayeth the Lord God:  Biden said we we should not talk of Jailing Donald Trump some day . . . for his many crimes.  God will send Liars to the Lake of Fire, for eternity, Jesus said. So why fret?
Major US postal workers union endorses Biden for president (from
Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I’m going to vote for Biden, of course, because I’m not a monster, but I’ll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn’t chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love’s The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn’t capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he’s choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won’t bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I’m not telling you who to vote for but you don’t think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn’t going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He’s scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn’t the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I’ll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
“She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,”  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump’s only concern is his ego, while Biden’s concern is what’s best for the country. He doesn’t hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween 🤔
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.
#Biden and #Harris just demanded a nationwide mask mandate. Because apparently they think mandates and masks are popular  #Masks #NationwideMaskMandate
FUCK BIDEN/HARRIS!!!!!!
Joe Biden thinking about little girls first thing in the morning does not surprise me
Bishop laments Biden-Harris ticket doesn’t have ‘a Catholic on it,' gets schooled by Twitter

Joe Biden just destroyed Donald Trump for his sexist attacks on Kamala Harris  via
Biden supporters act like they didn't have a prayer with just Joe, but now we have someone to save the day.
He’s already losing his shit over Obama living in his head. Now he’s got Biden and Harris taking up residencey
Biden in a basement. Meanwhile, Trump is actually accomplishing world peace  Read this. This is huge and historic!
If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History — as well as the near future — will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I’m really not voting for Biden
A quick perusal of  ‘s timeline will show you a number of hit pieces on Biden and Harris.  He’s proud FedSoc member.  In other words, consider the source and ignore the content. Shame on
Don’t attack/guilt trip people who aren’t okay with Biden/Harris. Some ppl don’t want to vote for segregationists and cops 🙃
Ok. Sure but Last year, Kamala Harris stated that she believes the women who have accused Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and kissing. “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That’s the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there’s a 20% chance he’ll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it’s 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden’s pick of Harris and it’s hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He’s seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn’t even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He’s a racist CisHet man who’s outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for “living in the past” about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He’d “lawfully and apolitically” bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he’ll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department 🙂
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she’s too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it’s sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn’t.  She may not apeal to the “Bernie Bro’s” but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. 🙄 Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45’s agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it’s one or the other (which it isn’t) personally I’d rather keep trump, at least we already know what he’s about. Biden hasn’t actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just “well I’m not trump” which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn’t sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all
Does any reasonable person actually believe Joe Biden would finish his first term?

You can be a hater all you want but I’ve made my decision and that was after I fought for Biden from the time he was crowned the nominee.   He’s the center the neo cons wanted why couldn’t he have reached out to the progressives with his choice? #rockbottom
Does ANY Democrat actually think Joe Biden would finish his first term?
Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It’s almost like we shouldn’t be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It’s almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....
I wonder who told Joe Biden he picked Kamala Harris for President? 🤔🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden took a nice bike ride this weekend. They probably didn’t show that on OANN or Faux News....
Is anyone else hopeful #Biden gets elected, yet fearful that in 4 years we’ll have a neo fascist president Nikki Haley (or some other choice propaganda/identity-#politics #prick) because they didn’t hit bottom w #trump? #Sad   #NoComradeLeftBehind
Just chortling over here when GOP says a Biden-Harris administration would be extreme and inept. Couple things: #1 - (ahem) 👀 #2 - Then why would you be so worried about them winning?
It really doesn’t matter, what is she going to run on? Her record? Hahaha 🤣!!! Biden is dead in the water along with Harris.
My immediate neighbors (white 50+) voted Trump but are going with Biden.  Like it’s an easy switch.  Even practical.
Just any woman won't do! #NeverKamala Biden just lost huge voting blocks. Not that we were wanting to vote for him. Now we're really done! #ByeByeBiden
We're not sheep to just follow like Trump voters. We have our own values and most importantly a VOTE and Biden and Harris are NEVER getting bit. They haven't earned it. They ARE what we've been fighting against! #NeverKamala #NeverBiden #NeverBidenHarris
I was going to answer, fairly recently! I wonder how she will feel when Biden comes up from behind, starts smelling her Hair, sniffing off Dandruff making it look as if he just snorted a Line of pure cocaine! She also must have forgotten that Women were accusing Biden!
...or while Biden is on Stage. He will utter the following phrase, Ah, my Time is up!...and guess what?  Something else just came up! Good night!! 🙋🏼‍♂️This leaves  victorious, as expected! Looks like Kamala dealt Biden, the final Blow!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Warren: "I'm Indian" (is white) Kamala: "I'm black" (is Indian) Biden: "You ain't black" (is Biden) Trump: "We need to fix our economy and get back to work."  Tough choice, man. Tough choice.
True! I hope he knew. I think Biden had his decision for some time. I’m hoping either Biden or Harris told him. 🙏

I voted for Hillary Clinton 3 times in my life. Biden? Shit. That’s the equivalent of running with slow people in the moral compromise space to me.
That would be interesting indeed. Jill Biden has her Doctorate in education, whereas, Melania has been to a doctor and has lied about her education.
1. Harris never called Biden a racist. 2. Criticizing her as a prosecutor AND a leftist is an interesting strategy.
Biden/Harris 2020. Yeah!!!
Maya Rudolph Had a Happy Four-Letter Reaction to Kamala Harris Being Named Biden's Running Mate

Baby Biden could have pick Sarah palin, he still would have had my vote! I am excited he picked an AA woman from an HBCU
It's a sign of how broken the social media ecosystem is that the largely irrelevant Tulsi Gabbard is trending on Twitter right now a few hours after Kamala Harris was announced as Biden's VP.
Went 2 work n found out joe biden chose Kamala as his vp??? Sick of it

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has announced California Sen. Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate for the 2020 election.
That's the ticket: Joe Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as his 2020 vice presidential running mateSo if it was Biden, it would not be a problem right?
Biden isn’t Catholic..he excommunicated himself by his actions on abortion
Why won't you press Harris or Biden? They won't answer any questions at so called press conferences.  Here's your opportunity to shine.🤡
Trump will be reelected w/ better margin than 2016. We know MSM polls oversample Democrats. Their recent poll says 62% of voters don't want 2 tell them whom they'll vote on Nov 3. They don't want 2 be attacked by Biden/Antifa/BLM supporters. The 62% is Trump 2020 silent majority.
I hope he is tapped for #AG or anything - he plays an important role now, but we could really use him in the Feds on the Biden Harris team, Love him #JulianCastro
Never get tired of that GIF. 😆
Will Kamala Harris help Joe Biden's bid for the White House?
Joe biden is a fucking moron. Im not even rock hard for singlepayer but he makes a TERRIBLE case for insurance tied to employment. He's a fucking idiot. Gonna be hard to vote for him

Biden Picks California Sen. Kamala Harris as Vice Presidential Running Mate
Tell me why the Biden campaign asks me for like $30 for their campaigning when Biden has billionaire backers. Yet Bernie was asking me for like $3 every here and there and he has not even millionaire backers. K Biden.
I’m going to vote for Biden, of course, because I’m not a monster, but I’ll always wonder what could have happened if Democrats hadn’t chickened out and supported the courageous and competent  this year instead.
Because a Biden win would guarantee eight more years of Trump.
I disagree. Donald is sabotaging the USPS, he's resurrecting the birther conspiracy for Harris, and he conspired with foreign govts to create a file of fake info on Biden. He asked foreign govts for help. This is a coup. The nazis vote as a block. We should too.
And having either trump or Biden in office is going to benefit us how? A known pedophile or a known abuser.
Prior to the virus America was on top and doing great.  Trump is the leadership we need.  If you vote Biden you get Kamala and believe me, America will not be the same.
I've definitely seen that take, and very forcefully too, to the point of calling people rape &amp; murder apologists for wanting to vote Biden for harm reduction
A lot more members voting for Trump than Biden. That says more than any other statistic.
Mike Pence &amp; His Red Meat are gonna open for Mike Love’s The Beach Boys on a coast-to-coast arena tour if biden wins and the schedule clears up
I'm still not convinced we have any substantive change with biden in office. I live at the bottom.  The "woke" can take the identity politics and shove it. No offense. So far they haven't made many policy promises... trump have me 300 a month to my unemployment. Substance
He knows what trump is capable of (Which is frightening) and we all know what he isn’t capable of ( being a honorable leader) if he’s choosing a lesser of two evils , choose Biden. Who won’t bring our country into a war. Which trump will do.
is progressing from a #CCP paid DC think tank to CCP espionage enabler. "Shanghai Academy acts as a front 4 Chinese spy recruitment according to FBI." "Nearly 2 dozen scholars at Brookings currently serve as advisers to the Biden campaign."
I mean I’m not telling you who to vote for but you don’t think Trump would continue to appoint judges that directly attack trans people as a whole, and unilaterally give orders to directly harm trans people? Biden is a rapist probs but he isn’t going to legalize rape
there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and Joe Biden will not be president he probably won't make it to the end of the year his wife should be ashamed of herself that she can't tell the man is seriously ill and declining mentally
besides that Biden is trying to take credit for it president trump should be awarded the Nobel peace prize
that is all Biden does is plagiarize everything he says the president has already said and done he has nothing to say about anything important
There are 100% those out there that are trying to blackpill people into not even getting rid of Trump right now, even saying that Trump might be better for the left than Biden. That's mostly what the issue is. I hate Biden but I've refocused my energy elsewhere for now.
Banning gatherings of 30 or more just means that only #Biden will be able to have rallies :/
The insults all played into racist and sexist stereotypes about Black women and made clear that Trump does not intend to throw away a playbook filled with misogynistic attacks and dog-whistle racism that have imbued his political career, even as the Biden campaign advances...This
Biden seemed to enjoy drawing attention to Trump's sexist remarks about Harris, such as when the President repeatedly called her "nasty" shortly after Biden announced her as his running mate, stating that the President was "whining." This one maybe? He’s scared of a strong woman?
Are you sure it isn’t the tweet where the virus president warned white folk that more people of color would be moving into their neighborhood if Biden/Harris are elected? Not it. Darn, a cite would have been helpful. I’ll keep looking.
If you want to pretend like this guy doesn't advocate not voting for Biden day in and day out nonstop that's cool I guess
If this is vote shaming, then saying not to vote for Biden is vote shaming too. I have spent multiple days a week in the streets with my local BLM comrades for months now, I haven't heard a single one of my black comrades say not to vote. I have heard many of them say to vote.
He didn't demand anything of black people or anybody else in particular, he was addressing anyone on "the left". He detailed an argument about why voting for Biden is part of a larger political strategy, assuming that to be about identity is... identity politics
“She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. It's hard to pick someone that was that disrespectful,”  Joe Biden is nothing like Trump. Trump’s only concern is his ego, while Biden’s concern is what’s best for the country. He doesn’t hold childish grudges like Trump
I never want to see biden and pussy in the same sentence ever again
Biden says all U.S. governors should mandate masks to slow coronavirus' spread
everything that comes out of Joe Biden mouth the president has already said and done he plagiarized everything he has nothing to say about anything important and he looks like a very frail senior he can barely complete a sentence
letting you know I screencapped your Biden tweets, in case it gets scrubbed....    put the heat to their feet!!!!
Maybe Biden thought this had to do with Halloween 🤔
"I learned about kids jumping on my lap" is exactly why they don't let Biden out in public any more on his own.
the only plausible harm reduction argument for voting for biden/harris is that they would certainly handle a pandemic better. if they kill thousands of people it will be because they start a war
We all miss Bernie. Biden should give him an office in the WH to fight voter suppression.
Biden calls for mandate requiring all Americans to wear masks  #FoxNews If this does not say "vote Trump" nothing will.
#Biden and #Harris just demanded a nationwide mask mandate. Because apparently they think mandates and masks are popular  #Masks #NationwideMaskMandate

Biden in a basement. Meanwhile, Trump is actually accomplishing world peace  Read this. This is huge and historic!
If any other democrat or president did this... it would be called out... you support it.   Would you support it if biden said the same thing when your guy was leading ? Doubt it
If you can vote for 20+ years by mail like I have and my vote has been counted.... why now is it an issue when its really only trump who is worried he is gonna lose cause the writing is on the wall. He won in 2016 with the process. He knows people dislike biden. Less than clinton
'Antifa' website cited in conservative media attack on Biden is linked to — wait for it — Russia #Smartnews Putin for Trump - Putin will do whatever he can to keep his puppet, Trump
The violence is going to be off the charts when the left controls the house, senate and WH again and Fox will be an integral part of that happening. History — as well as the near future — will not be kind to any of them.
the postal accountability and enhancement act was passed in 2006 when biden was a senator. the administration he was vice president of did nothing about it and never tried. he's not going to save the fucking post office.
Nope. Now I’m really not voting for Biden
A quick perusal of  ‘s timeline will show you a number of hit pieces on Biden and Harris.  He’s proud FedSoc member.  In other words, consider the source and ignore the content. Shame on
Don’t attack/guilt trip people who aren’t okay with Biden/Harris. Some ppl don’t want to vote for segregationists and cops 🙃
Ok. Sure but Last year, Kamala Harris stated that she believes the women who have accused Joe Biden of inappropriate behavior, including unwanted touching and kissing. “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said

Hit the dab pen every time biden sniffs or awkwardly touches kamala harris or says something weird and uncalled for about her body throughout the campaign trail. That’s the only way im going to survive this hellection
My cows are all gone. I blame the Biden /Harris campaign.
I mean, Bernie lost the primary, Biden never said he supported it, he was open and honest about that all along. People chose Biden because of media narratives about "electability" which are self-fulfilling, and intervention by well liked Dems in the primary. It is what it is.
Joe picked her?  I think not. I'm sure there were those in the Biden camp did the picking for him.
If anyone said they heard her call Biden a racist their ears must be living in another dimension.
.5 sec - "I don't know why..." is the lie. Joe Biden better stay in good health, else she could be a conspirator, or I am tripping
Joe Biden is 77yo. Based on generic actuarial data (odds of death w/in the next year, based on age) there’s a 20% chance he’ll die in the next four years. If we up that to 8 years, it’s 50%.
He has absolutely no idea how to handle Biden’s pick of Harris and it’s hilarious.
Until 11/3, I know who we is.  After? Will Lincoln go back to being small gov't, low tax, anti-reg, deficit hawk, climate crisis denial, neo-lib militarism, substandard health care, e.g. mainstream R?  Elect Biden/Harris and then attack?
Chip in to elect Joe Biden and other Democrats on the ballot
I'm in Oregon, an hour from Portland. I drive daily all over for business.  I've seen ONE (1) Biden sign and it was out in a small town. I pulled over to take a picture, a car passed and saw me doing it and the driver gave me the "I know, right?" gesture.  Seen 4 Bigfoot btw.
He’s seconds away from the bully pulpit and he doesn’t even mention the millions of American who struggle with low water pressure or are in the battle of their lives against stage 4 Windmill Cancer?  A vote for Joe Biden is a vote for crazy Aunt Tiffa!
neither one of them said a thing about the protest and looting Harris is going to defund the police and Biden is just one of the fine old folks neither said anything about helping America more lies and propaganda Harris flows like the wind
OOOOHH!  Keenly astute! Listen closely, She said, "Perhaps, that's what he (Joe Biden) wanted!"
He’s a racist CisHet man who’s outta touch will the majority of voters. His policies he wrote and voted for were garbage and extremely pro-police state. He picked who he picked for a reason. Centrist Dems have already told me off for “living in the past” about Biden.
I want Biden to make  AG OR Mr. Kirschner could be put in charge of the Trump Crimes Commission. Mr. Kirschner learned much from Robert Mueller and truly respects the Rule of Law. He’d “lawfully and apolitically” bring Trump &amp; his crime family to justice.
You just want Biden so he’ll cover up for you pervs and traffickers
Let your Democrat friends think you're voting Biden. Lie to the pollsters if you have to. We cannot afford to lose this election, but being yelled at and spit on is also inconvenient.  Smile, nod and VOTE.
To smear who? Antifa or Biden and Harris? Neither really need help in that department 🙂
I'm not crying, you're crying. #Competence2020
Watching the Biden speech, then noticed the ad. Subliminal message or clever advertising, you decide.
Then they say that she’s too smart.  She will outshine Biden. Ok is that a backhanded compliment?  We tried really stupid for almost 4 years we need to trade up
Biden is one of the worst candidates ever but all he has to do is just sit in his basement and let Trump destroy himself. Trump used to attack attack attack and now he does is play the victim it’s sai!. These two are going to reverse every thing Trump did during his election.
You still want to put your faith in a broken, corrupt system with Biden though ? I feel the time for that is long gone  ( like decades gone). How many times do we need to keep giving them a chance to the right things, and come up with empty promises? By the People for the People
Progressives like myself.  Young, energetic voters who want real change.  She definitely excites younger more progressive voters in ways Tim Kaine couldn’t.  She may not apeal to the “Bernie Bro’s” but she speaks to a much larger base than say...Biden or Pence.
45 is running his mouth spouting absolutes with ZERO proof Biden will do anything of the kind. 🙄 Keep in mind that 45 &amp; his boot lickers are NOT stating what 45’s agenda is for his second term. 45 et al are desperately searching for a boogie man to scare votes out of people.
Have you checked out Lars?  Here's his thoughts:
If it’s one or the other (which it isn’t) personally I’d rather keep trump, at least we already know what he’s about. Biden hasn’t actually spoken on his views much his entire campaign is just “well I’m not trump” which is very dangerous
Yeah, thing about that is if everyone thinks like that there would literally not be a chance, if people voted for who they actually wanted we would be able to do away with the duopoly. Personally, I couldn’t sleep at night voting for trump or Biden I would sooner not vote at all
Does any reasonable person actually believe Joe Biden would finish his first term?

You can be a hater all you want but I’ve made my decision and that was after I fought for Biden from the time he was crowned the nominee.   He’s the center the neo cons wanted why couldn’t he have reached out to the progressives with his choice? #rockbottom
Does ANY Democrat actually think Joe Biden would finish his first term?
Kamala Harris is a phony and just goes with the flow of the radical left wing also a liar and Joe Biden doesn't even know he picked her but just wait he will be sniffing her and touching her and if he wins America is done our great nation will fall
It’s almost like we shouldn’t be counting on Biden to solve those problems that may have led to Trump, but instead organize and mobilize to force whoever the people are in power to act. It’s almost like that would be way more possible if we avoid full-on fascism....
I wonder who told Joe Biden he picked Kamala Harris for President? 🤔🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Biden took a nice bike ride this weekend. They probably didn’t show that on OANN or Faux News....
Is anyone else hopeful #Biden gets elected, yet fearful that in 4 years we’ll have a neo fascist president Nikki Haley (or some other choice propaganda/identity-#politics #prick) because they didn’t hit bottom w #trump? #Sad   #NoComradeLeftBehind
Just chortling over here when GOP says a Biden-Harris administration would be extreme and inept. Couple things: #1 - (ahem) 👀 #2 - Then why would you be so worried about them winning?
It really doesn’t matter, what is she going to run on? Her record? Hahaha 🤣!!! Biden is dead in the water along with Harris.
My immediate neighbors (white 50+) voted Trump but are going with Biden.  Like it’s an easy switch.  Even practical.

I was going to answer, fairly recently! I wonder how she will feel when Biden comes up from behind, starts smelling her Hair, sniffing off Dandruff making it look as if he just snorted a Line of pure cocaine! She also must have forgotten that Women were accusing Biden!

Warren: "I'm Indian" (is white) Kamala: "I'm black" (is Indian) Biden: "You ain't black" (is Biden) Trump: "We need to fix our economy and get back to work."  Tough choice, man. Tough choice.
True! I hope he knew. I think Biden had his decision for some time. I’m hoping either Biden or Harris told him. 🙏

That would be interesting indeed. Jill Biden has her Doctorate in education, whereas, Melania has been to a doctor and has lied about her education.
1. Harris never called Biden a racist. 2. Criticizing her as a prosecutor AND a leftist is an interesting strategy.

There are 77 days between 11/3/2020 &amp; 01/20/2021. The good news is that Congress is sworn in on 01/03/2021. If we’ve done our jobs and voted BLUE for Biden &amp; ALL Democrats down ballot, we will have control of the House and the Senate. Pelosi and Schumer will slap him stupid(er).
China loves Pelosi and Biden I say we let China have them
What people need to realize is that neither #Trump or #Biden give a flying fuck about them or their problems. #Voting for either one is like voting for the king of #Babylon. #Revelation 17:1&amp;2
Joe #Biden shouldn’t #debate #president #Trump if he wants to win but the #American people might want to see if Joe can stand up to #Trump without making a complete fool of himself.
Joe Biden's VP choice is more than likely gonna be a white lady, because he’s out of touch. We all know he should have chosen Stacy Abrams but you know, a younger strong Black woman lawyer being his VP isn't in his wheelhouse. Prepare to be underwhelmed by a centrist candidate.
The only way to stop Joe Biden is let him debate Trump   Well, not the only  Just let him talk. Period.
Well, Christians clearly cannot vote for Biden when he is clearly  anti-life, anti- Catholic...I mean really, if someone says something you don’t like, but they uphold the principles of LIFE then to vote against life is a grave, grave sin...

That lead is BS and anyone with any brains knows it. Complete hogwash. Biden stands NO chance against Trump.
Also, if the thought of voting FOR Biden bothers you, think of it as “casting the only potential vote _against_ Trump” instead.

She has a point.  Will the Lincoln Project attack Pres. Biden for doing what he says he's going to do?  Restore environmental protections, raise taxes on the wealthy, expand health care, cut fossil fuel use, expand the safety net, etc?
Biden is pro baby murder. Nuff said
I do think that’s true in part. WHEN we elect Joe Biden as POTUS, we will have a sane President again who actually cares about ALL Americans including the ones who didn’t vote for him. That said: We have a rough road ahead to mop up 45’s &amp; his admin’s messes.
Trump's cosmopolitanism is good. Non-Trump cosmopolitanism is bad. Trump misspeaking is not misspeaking, it's him doing something cosmopolitan that little liberal minds don't understand. Biden misspeaking is a sign he's brain damaged. Come on man, keep up! It's just logic.
Most Americans don't have short term memory loss. America has the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. You, Mr. Trump, do a better job of lying and stretching the truth than leading the country. Biden will Make America Great Again! BIDEN 2020. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Duh. And Biden was running to stop Bernie who was running to stop an actual revolution. That’s it. That’s American politics.

What's the over/under on Biden using the N word on live TV...?
I see how the Catholics would spin this, but unfortunately I honestly believe trump has no idea whether Biden is catholic Christian or atheist and I know he doesn’t care. He would say this if Biden was evangelical. The catholic spin is a reach for me

45 NEVER talks about what plans he has for his second term. He NEVER tells us what he plans on doing to “Keep America Great”. Biden does point out 45’s many illegal acts but he also tells us how he plans to actually make things better for everybody. VOTE BLUE!

CNN VP rips ‘really gross’ attack on Joe Biden’s Catholic faith by right-wing website -
TRUMP CALLED JOE BIDEN "GODLESS"--BUT JESUS SAID,          "DO NOT JUDGE"!  Attending Church once in ten years  Trump said publicly that Biden is "Godless"! He is LYING AGAIN!.  Biden is a Devout Christian--a lifetime member of his church.  But LIARS WILL GO TO HELL, Jesus said.
Trump’s latest attack on Joe Biden is stunningly delusional — even for him -
He is aware of the damage he will cost the good people of this nation. If he wants to get in the race to pull votes from Biden and award trump, he deserves ridicule and plenty of it.
Indeed! While VP Biden is outlining his many plans for helping America conquer COVID-19 and putting America back on track, 45 is using the same old tired game plan from 2016. Use VP Biden as the boogie man. Make up anything, no matter how outlandish. to land the vote. 👎
Live look in to Joe Biden's house where he's pacing around screaming "Grrrr, sometimes I just want to punch God so much, you know what I mean? Just like, bam, right in the kisser. I wake up and just can't stop thinking about it."
Really is terrifying to think about. I mean, the devil will transform into the super devil even. Whole world will never be the same if Biden is elected. The horror.
Chris Wallace: My first question Vice President Biden is this, why do you want to be President. Biden: Duh! To hurt God. Come on Chris, isn’t that obvious?conservatives democrats always made the same promises biden does. 'business as usual' is not going to fix the over reach that just happenned. If he holds the fbi above the law then hes just another nazi dictator running a police state.
Trump and associates crimes are too severe to allowed them to walk free. There will be no Pres. Ford to pardon him, like Nixon was! Biden has already stated he will NOT stand in the way of Trump's prosecution! This is the REAL reason Trump will do ANYTHING to win reelection!
LIAR. Biden!!! Not a trusteorthy bone in your body!!!

bernie is even worse. damn the demoicrats for even talking to sanders and for runnind biden. Boith too conservative for me.
We can elect Joe Biden and Kamala but unless we get rid of the filibuster we will have political gridlock for at least the next 2 years.
I just heard Dan Bongino say the Harris Biden ticket wants us to wear masks all the time, inside and outside. I describe Joe Biden as Crucking fazy, I'm trying to be a lady.
We will never settle for Biden, we will not settle until this whole damn system has been dismantled, Biden and Trump seek to disarm the working class, which is an inherently bad thing as anyone who isn't armed is subject to the will of fascism, no matter who they are.
its always serious when its poor people, she said she wasnt to use the fbi to clean up our communities. What has she said shed do to stop the fbi from picking the president? What will biden do to stop that?

As a leftist who wants Biden to win, I have some advice for y’all in the establishment:  “Come the fuck on” is not going to convince leftists to vote for centrists. Try something else.
Didn’t attract anyone who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden
I am a touchy feely person like Biden. I hug everyone! These are his family!    At least he doesn’t molest women in clubs, dressing rooms, at pageants and have affairs while wife #3 is pregnant,oh &amp; brag about being able to grab women in their privates (used vulgar terminology).
And Biden/ the DNC haven't? One wrong doesn't negate another.   If I murder 1 or 5 people, I'm still a murderer. I don't understand how you #BlueMAGA people can support any of it. So gross.
Well guess  got snickered by  too. Oh well, not that he was ever known for anything other than RoboCop anyways. Enjoy Biden James!
FOX's Jeanine Pirro broadcasted a Veiled Threat that Biden would not make it to the election. There were no consequences for that horrible statement. If a democratic broadcasting station said Trump will not make it to the election the FBI with guns blazing with raid their office.
Take Biden and an honest administration.
Nope. No fracture big enough to fit an orange dictator-wannabe through it. Not even close. Stop trying to make it seem like we aren’t all voting Biden/Harris no matter what. 48 million in 48 hours. There’s no contest in a free and fair election.
A vote for Biden/Harris is a vote for police terrorism.

They each had enough confidence to tell Biden’s VP vetting team directly that they thought it was Harris’s campaign. Amazing.

“Biden advisers asked about contributions she received as state attorney general from Steven Mnuchin, who at the time was running a bank, OneWest, that was accused of violating foreclosure laws. Ms. Harris declined to pursue prosecutions in the case.”

Since the right wing leaders always blames others for what they are themselves guilty of doing, it is obvious right wing child molesters are behind this campaign against Biden. Not rocket science.
So Biden/Harris will mandate that everyone wear a mask for the next 3 months if elected? Guess they think if elected they will be king/queen, well they can kiss a$$, I'm not a child that needs a parent to decide what is in my best interest. Food will be next watch and see.
“You’re not allowed to criticize Biden and you’re not allowed to push him on any policies until after the election!”  Considering the fact this is the time period when he’s *releasing* his policy proposals and his various agendas, this is a terrible idea.
We can vote for Biden and hold him accountable at the same time. It’s not like our brains ran out of energy to do multiple things   Blindly swearing allegiance while not holding him accountable is a terrible idea.
The vitriol and shocking statements coming from Trump are an indication of his insanity. He wants to prosecute Obama and Biden for treason???? What!!! Where are the men with white coats and straight jackets? Yet the criminal Republican Senators keep quiet.
Fuck Donald Trump and Fuck Joe Biden

I don’t think it’s very accurate to say the party is moderate when Democrats voted based on their fears. Multiple polls showed policies pushed by Bernie and Warren were more popular than Biden. Polling specifically showed Democratic voters to trust Bernie more on healthcare
Obama was too charming; he made democrats lazy. Nobody likes Biden; we're going to be on his ass the entire time.
This is ignorant of all the progress we've made these last years. The left is alive and strong. We will effectively pressure Biden and the democrats to clean up this mess. Our words are currently falling on deaf ears. It will not be like that after January.

So far, Biden and the DNC have shown a lot of contempt for progressives. We’ll vote for Biden, but only because it’s getting Trump out of office.

NPR talking about how financial managers are happy Biden chose Kamala Harris, I’m feeling nauseous
There was a lot of pressure from donors to pick Kamala Harris. Remember: Karen Bass is just as progressive as Warren and Biden still didn’t choose her.
that might be the secret of his success. sanders comey trump, democrats treat anyone who treats them like crap like gold. harris/biden proves they are not liberal now.

Great reporting. You really nailed Biden here.

she is better choice then joe biden and hillary clinton, she dose not have  same backlash as both them.

So everybody, please vote for what you believe in not the "lesser of 2 evils". Make your vote count and your voice be heard. If you do believe in Trump or Biden and vote the one you believe in then at least you are doing what you think is best and I will still support you.
He’s explaining why we won’t vote for Biden.
I’m all for pushing for progressive legislation, but bagging on Biden’s 1994 crime bill vote or saying Harris is a cop after they are chosen as THE ONLY GODT-DAMNED TICKET THAT CAN PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY is what Putin wants. Save it for November 5th.
Why not have Biden do that, he is after all the supposed POTUS candidate? Also, should Harris address her accusations that Biden is a racist and at least a sexual assaulter?
The people have spoken. Biden maybe won't listen.. Trump will actively not listen.  And if Biden does not listen, our protests will very likely have a larger impact on a Biden administration.  It's so obvious what the right choice is. And abstaining in November is not it.
You’ve implied multiple times that young people’s opinions don’t matter so why are you so pressed about my tweets? Biden and Harris both ran terrible campaigns, they are only succeeding because Trump, in comparison, is a total disaster. There is no enthusiasm for Biden. None.
You seem to have a problem with any criticism of Biden/Harris.   Do you think they are infallible?  Do you think we should be prohibited from saying anything negative about them?  Since you have so much disdain for young people, why do you reply to my tweets?
And the only way to change that is to have Biden move further to the Left to entice them.  This is the alternative
No, I think it’s healthy to point out dissatisfaction with the VP choice because it will only pressure Biden to move further left. The 100,000+ people that retweeted those anti-Kamala memes probably aren’t thrilled about voting for Biden
She actually won't unless Biden dies. Are you looking for that to happen?
It really is dependent on the president.  Some presidents allow their VPs to have more power and influence, some don't.  If Biden has selected Warren (or Karen Bass!) that wouldve signaled a willingness to be more progressive.  Instead he chose Kamala Harris, an empty suit.
I know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are both terrible politicians but please vote Democratic downballot in November 😔
Biden and Harris will be the best thing to happen to America sense Obama and Biden left office
Of course it is a shell game. But now we know it and time has come to change the game. This election is only part of it. But if Trump is elected again, the USA is dead and gone. At least with Biden, there is someone who will listen. Everything will change sooner than expected.
That Harris pick yesterday, hit Trump supporters like rabies! And yet, they know they would have hated ANYONE Biden picked.
Nothing about what I’ve said implies I’m not voting for Biden. We should be allowed to criticize the ticket
I believe that is the boat a lot of us are in. So, responding to every angry tweet with how if someone doesn't vote for Harris/Biden they will be ensuring mass deaths is really not necessary.  We know. We're angry and tired as hell, but we know.
Let me make this clear:  I am angry as hell that Kamala Harris was selected as VP.  But, me continually talking about just how pissed I am does NOT change my vote this November. I am still voting for Biden - I'm just even angrier about it than I was before.
Doesn’t attract any voter who wasn’t already planning to vote for Biden. Young voters and progressives do not trust her
DwellerYsul, BULL HOCKEY! There was no infighting because the people pulling the strings on the Biden puppet were in full agreement. They knew enough not to bicker and put their brilliant plan to retake the WH in jeopardy. His only choice, if any, was for the prettiest one.
I don't ordinarily display political signs, but I ordered a Biden/Harris sticker, and I will display it proudly, full of hope! #BidenHarris2020
You can be angry with the VP choice and still vote for Biden.  Kamala Harris doesn’t support student debt relief, a wealth tax, or Medicare for All.  Her record as attorney general and DA has a lot of blemishes.   But at least she’s better than Mike Pence!
Yeah I’m voting for Biden as well
Oh yeah, Kamala is Joe Biden's little blue pill for sure.
I haven’t seen a single Warren person say they’re voting for Trump because of the Kamala VP choice  I have seen a ***lot*** of tweets from young people expressing their disdain and anger at Biden for his decision.
The way he uses stupid childish names to insult Biden and Kamala is beyond belief.
Let me debunk this lie:  Kamala Harris recorded her endorsement video for Joe Biden *before* Warren dropped out.
This comparison doesn’t feel right. I mean Biden is 71% campaigning in the background, so adjusted for that it seems he is doing much better.
CNN drops the death ticker the instant Biden is elected.
I know people in my own life that supported Biden and Kamala in the primaries and argued with me for months that didn’t even bother to register to vote in the primaries. These are deeply unserious people.
Joe is a friend to Wall St though...
You can't blame her for what has been in place for decades. But I sure as hell know that she and Biden are not Trump and are more open to change and reason. Get rid of Trump and the GOP in the Senate and the rest is much easier.
Criticize Harris and Biden but never forget the existential crisis we’re in right now. I’m voting for Biden and Harris and you should too. Then we’ll protest them too.
Biden had overwhelming black support in the south, specifically South Carolina. Across the country it was evenly split between him and Bernie.  Trump won suburban white women last time but the polling is showing he’s lost them.
Another liar. I bet you the farm that Biden did NOT say that.
And you're calling BIDEN racist. Give me a break, you lying hypocrite.
When will the Democratic candidates for President and Vice President receive security protection? Biden perhaps already has it because he’s a Former Vice President. Kamala Harris will need it immediately because of all of Trump’s crazy second amendment thugs. 👀👀
i’ve written out like a dozen draft tweets about the author of how to be an anti-racist supporting biden/harris and i just...... please........ why..............
That’s not gonna help fight against Biden’s lack of cognitive ability. He can’t get that back. Lol
no kate this is simply NOT POSSIBLE and i won’t entertain the thought for a SINGLE SECOND! i’m too busy settling for biden and thinking it’s an effective strategy to encourage disillusioned nonvoters!
