Basically if Biden wins it’s simply because more people disliked Trump. We’re also voting for whoever Biden’s running mate is because there is no way he’s getting through a 4 year term with his mental state the way it is.
You are so very welcome Monica  🌹🌹Appreciate you, my dear and wonderful friend!!🌹💖🇺🇸💘😉🤩😍🌟💞💐🥰🤗😘😘😘
Texas and Florida are a Covid disaster. We are at the beginning of this catastrophe. Wait until school kids become vectors. Donald Trump will be the cause of death of at least 1,000,000 Americans, deaths that could have been avoided. And probably more.
Thank you dear  Here's more
Trump just announced that he had just eon the second world war
The term “misinformation” is used so that the boomers, who buy into the crock of shit that is Donald Trump’s rhetoric, won’t have their feelings hurt as badly when they are called out for believing blatant LIES.   Wear a damn mask, assholes.
trump actually takes them serious as a threat. biden is too dead to be a threat to them

Regardless of our race, religion, national origin, or age...it's going to be the women who will set the tone for the outcome of the General Election.   B/c we've had enough backtalk from the  and we're T-I-R-E-D of Trump's chit!  #bottomline

Thank you dear  Adding more:
Sounds like he was being honest about what they would see.  What's wrong with that?  If you were half as honest as President Trump you'd do a lot better!   🤣😂🤣
Agree.  The plan is for neither Trump or Biden to be President.  Mail in voting is key and Pelosi will be President to an unresolvable count.  They don’t care what the issues are, just as long as there are lots of them.
If you’re a Democrat, two are to blame:  #1 Trump, #2 Covid.
Another link that has the rest of the video.
Yes, Trump is responsible.  Poor leadership, lack of planning, fallacies, and praising protesters of the lockdown.   Trump did say Obama should be responsible for U.S  H1N1 deaths, 12,000 + in 1 year. In 5 months COVID-19 has killed over 158,000 Americans. #itiswhatitis
Trump kicks ass!
Apart from that.  Tonight’s speech made it clear this man is looking out for America, and not interested in playing politics for personal gain.  So glad to have Trump in office!
unless ur a trump supporter thats the only time i’d judge
Trump is a “saint” by the blood.
Trump advisors repeatedly steered him away from military options for fear he would start a war.
))Ahem!((  I think I can speak for a good portion, if not most American women when I say...Donald J Trump needs to stay full clear of our Thighlands.  ))That is all.((
The Trump Virus is very real. And the Trump hoax is very real. Your corruption and callousness knows no bounds. #TrumpVirusDeathToll160K
Why are my Twitter friends watching Trump? Fuck that. Have some fun.
Trump is rambling like an old friend you haven’t seen since high school and you realize too late that they are sniffing that good china white.
Thx, Neal, but isn’t it inevitable that anything unfavorable to Trump will be appealed all the way to SCOTUS, which will strike it down?
"Unemployment has dropped   by 33% since April 2020?..."  - Trump #fromthepodium   😆😆😆❗️
Putin. Bounties. Troops. Trump. Silence. See ya at the polls, BOZO! #trumpresignnow #TrumpVirusDeathToll156K #25thAmendmentNow
Yeah and it will hit right when trump is out whining for votes and I hope his own followers turn on his ass and tell him stfu anywhere he goes. Flying around like it’s nobody’s business to his own golf resorts to get more of our hard earned tax money. That they STILL collected.
Trump is Herbert Hoover #2.
As an Alaskan....we are HORRIFIED that Trump is okaying the Pebble Mine—-which will destroy salmon spawning grounds...Among other horrors. This is why Dr. Al Gross(Independent) has a good fighting chance to beat GOP Dan ‘Do Nothing’ Sullivan in November!!
Bert—the potus is not an independent dictator with unilateral powers. I know Trump fancies himself King, but he isn’t.
I propose that ALL Red States who vote for Trump leave the U.S. &amp; form their own country—&amp; thus stop getting funded by Blue State tax $$ &amp; federal funds. This would include AL, GA, MISS., ARK, &amp; possibly FL. Then they can build whatever monuments they want—w/their own money.
Fuck them
If Pompeo talked to Russia about bounties, why didn't Trump?
China &amp; Russian, or whatever nation that is involved, needs to have the full weight of the U.S. upon them.  The push back has to long-term and impactful.  Must be bi-partisan, unified, and without any daylight between the R's and D's on this.    Trump will not lead on the way.
My favorite trump supporter dis is: “Obama is still your hair style’s president” 😵
Thanks to President Trump he may address the issue by EO.  Unfortunately the worthless Democrats cared more about special interests than the American people!
Kaitlin Bennett's Trump Boat Rally! OMFG! KILL ME! Now.  via
Yes and if found guilty its either life in prison or execution . I want trump to spend life in prison with the biggest gayest black cellmate .
Yep 👍, our President Trump will forever be known as the ‘Empowerment and Economics President.’
Why didn’t Trump??
Don’t even keep track anymore.
a security threat?  How about Trump has no presence on the platform and got punk'd by a bunch of TikTok teenagers at his Tulsa Rally.  The threat is that TikTok users might rally to vote and they don't like Trump.
Time to call it like it is. You're a shill for a fool. Trump is a traitor. Your actions are directly harmful to America and Americans. The GOP is dead. Trump killed it. Move on and form a new conservative party. #GOPCorruptionOverCountry
remember when everyone said Hillary would win cause Trump is such an easy beat? Lol
U can say what ever u want,sloppy orange coward shows us daily that his brain is damaged he reads at a child like level can't pay attention for 5 minutes. He not a cosmopolitan he's a fuckhead,trump couldn't read or understand ur tweet if it was written in crayons with pictures.

etc. didn't learn a damn thing about giving trump free advertising from 2016. Turns out he's right about "ratings"
Homeboy has been sleep during this whole time....... President Trump has endured hardships from every front. In that he stays the course accomplishing much more than any President. Go back to sleep  you missed the train.  Cry Babies Need not apply
Millions across the country, from  in Alaska, to     and  all agree #NoPebbleMine. They’re confident  will make the right decision.
Ok yeah, but when can you call him as a witness? After the Supreme Court gets a chance to look and then sends it back to the courts for "new arguments" while Trump is still ruining our country?
He doesn't realize he's been in charge for 4 years. Our current problems are a result of Trump's admin. They even had two years owning the WH, Senate and House. No excuse anywhere that explains why his bankrupted businesses are different than his bankrupted country. You suck dude
OK, I won’t get a vaccine if Trump has anything to do with it. It’s unfortunate, but true.
Suspicious that ACLU constantly and ONLY attack President Trump and GOP, yet NEVER knock DEMS? Bible tells us we'll 'know their hearts by their words'. 4 YEARS of OBVIOUS partisan rants by ACLU, dismisses them as an honest source but elevates them to 'a clear &amp; present danger!
I had a dream that I met Donald Trump &amp; it was fuckin weird
This analysis is excellent! Please read
You wouldn’t know hypocrisy if it snuck up behind you and bit ya in the keister! You really think your hurting our feelings with your self righteous drivel? Trump lives in your head and you are now reduced to trolling Twitter like the good little snowflake lib that you are. Bravo
Nope .. Trump is not smart enough to be the anti-Christ ..
No wonder why trump wants this removed it is showing who is racist  thank you TikTok I say let the app run and ban all who do this and be ban on all social media Apps to protect everyone
Facebook Employees Wonder What Would Happen if Trump Used Their Platform to Dispute Election Results - A senior engineer collected internal evidence that showed Facebook was giving preferential treatment to prominent conservative accounts
No we are not all with this fake impeached president! How stupid after all this time to believe anything good or decent about this lying con man! You know who else called the media fake? Hitler! Much of what Trump does is relatable to Hitler... history repeats!
People know that giving away 400,000 a year is no big deal when you can steal millions from tax payers! He cares for no one but Trump, not the country, not the soldiers, not the sick or the dead!
That’s all bullshit! What do you think Trump is going to do, when reporting straight to him instead of the CDC happens? Exactly what you believe right now! He has blood on his hands and would rather golf then give a damn!
Admittedly, it would be hard for any semi-competent person to negligently kill 160,000 Americans in 7 months.    Trump is either grossly incompetent, or criminally malicious.
True, however the current GOP has lost my trust as they've capitulated to Trump at every step.
Trump will be! He’s a criminal and some of you are just to stupid and blind to see the truth!!
Wow talking about misinformation!! You need to get away from Fox fake news. Trump politicized a virus and used it against blue states, blamed it on their failed leadership! One thing we now know is Trump’s words are pure projection! Trump kills!
What’s fake and corrupt is you Donald Trump!! You’re a liar and a fraud, a con man! Your desperation is showing and we’re smart enough to not fall for it!                                             Real news is Fake Trump!!
Taking his non-leadership role from trump

How am I going to watch my funny videos and communicate with my fellow BTS Army?

Because TRUMP IS PRESIDENT! He and republicans don’t give two shits about kids once they’ve let the mother-ship
Trump gassed people to get to a Church for a photo op. And that was the last time he came near a Church.
Trump had threatened a deadline of Sept. 15 to “close down” TikTok unless Microsoft or “somebody else” bought it.
Biden’s dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn’t interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They’ll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA

Trump orders vague ban on dealings with Chinese owners of popular social media apps TikTok and WeChat
Both sides said the future of the talks is uncertain. President Donald Trump is considering executive orders to address evictions and unemployment insurance, but they appear unlikely to have much impact.
Alex Jones, Tucker Carlsen, Hannity, Pirro...take you pick of all the lunatics trump listens to 24/7.
If we could pick a leader, how about William as Hand of the Queen, and he could oversee the trial and execution of trump?  Or something
Dissolve and dismantle the Trump Administration.
Trump is making everything he touches worse, and it’s exhausting
It is shaking down all our own strength, &amp; forcing us all to question if we want to live or not. That’s the sweeping existential crisis replaying like a bad song on the radio Trump lies like an arsonist playing with Fire, then plays the hero, trying to put out a fire he started
Lmao american "libertarians" are one of the only groups of voters dumber than hardcore trump people
Very disgusting if you said this. God I m tired of this crap. You had 8 years of Obama. Any progress during his reign. HE DID WELL! HOW ABOUT BLACK AMERICA? They were doing better under Trump!!!!!!
It’s tax payer money, and it’s going to already obscenely rich churches, like Paula White, and other big talking lying wonders the Bible warned us all about in the last days. I didn’t know what it meant when the Bible said: “whosoever loveth and maketh a lie” till I saw trump
You don’t have to be perfect to worship God BUT don’t forget to worship God, and not yourself Trump worships himself
We just need people to lie more to pollsters and say they are voting for Trump.  Strong polls, and he'll relax.
Hope none of them catch Trump's China Flu
But Republicans are the MAJORITY in the Senate, Bert.  Trump is a white supremacist who openly uses racist hate speech. And he also mocks people who have disabilities. He is a despicable person lacking basic ethical moral values.  Trump and his Republican cronies are UnAmerican.
You do know we are in the second Great Depression, correct? And that millions are unemployed? And the economy is in tatters under this Republican potus and Senate? This is how Trump and his Republican cronies are ‘Making America Great Again’—destroying our democracy.

Um. I guess it won’t be a landslide. I don’t see Biden winning Alaska no matter what Trump does. Side note— I am an Alaskan, born and raised.
Run against him in the next election. A 24 year old defeated a candidate endorsed by trump in North Carolina.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 these comments are gold! Like I didn’t even care trump said it wrong- he can barely read, let alone speak- but now I’m totally invested in the defense of him saying it 😂
There is LITERALLY no way- that trump said if that way because someone in Asia/India does. Trump said it wrong and then corrected himself. It was funny &amp; lame- yes. He said it wrong and yet you are spending all this time to explain it. This is the hill? Let it go, this is weird.
Safest place is aloft in Airforce 1, the President can stay up there as long as he wants!)  Prayers for President Trump, May God bless him and his family and America!)
Trump could not get a bigger syncophant than pense. Lol. I think nokki haley is "too ambitious". She gets alot of press. Trump would be peeved
President Trump will hear us tomorrow. Please join our tweet storm to tell the president that Pebble is the wrong mine for the wrong place. #HuntFishStopPebble
Trump denounced for ‘attempt to gut Social Security’ after he announces plan to unilaterally suspend payroll tax
Do you think when trump says ‘they said’ that they are voices in his head? Or like is someone really saying these things?  I just really really wanna know who ‘they’ is.   Because ‘they’ are saying a lot of stupid shit and orange mister potatoe head keeps repeating it
It gets better! I’m sick of this too Even if Trump gets everything he wants, he’s too stupid to hold on to it. You are smarter than he is. Don’t let it poison your mind and heart. No one is ready for this. We are all in the same boat.
This is a dare Trump and Reps (McConnell, an the Supreme Court) will make the NRA part of the constitution or shred it. Trump would appoint La Pierre just to piss off Dems MOAR, and stir the pot, as his base loves. We are past a boiling point, into a breaking point
Don’t pin this on Steven King  He said himself Trump is worse than any character he’s ever thought up.  King is too smart to fathom someone so incomprehensibly stupid, selfish, wicked, and abusive.
Pretty transparent that McConnell and company are opening the door for an executive order to extend benefits, etc... so that uninformed voters will be like “boy that trump feller really cares about the people”.
The only reason I’m anxious is to deal with the crap. There will be people who complain- and it will be something else for trumps shit to talk shit about. I personally don’t care- trump HAS to go. It could be a spider for all I care and I HATE spiders. I hate trump more tho 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Looking good, Sexi!  Very patriotic!!💞🌹💞🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
my grandma just told me and said that trump was a good president if he wasn't on twitter. then i countered with him being racist, sexist, accused of sexual assault, denied coronavirus seriousness and she just goes ' yeah, but if he didn't do those things, he'd be good. ' what ???
Just a periodic reminder, in 2016 we were internationally considered the country best equipped to handle a pandemic. Now in 2020 we are the only developed nation that COVID has brought to its knees. It wasn't bad luck or misperceptions in 2016, it's the choices Trump made.
#VoteBlue2020 Let's make that blue wave happen!  He Predicted Trump’s Win in 2016. Now He’s Ready to Call 2020.
I don’t have a lot of hate in my heart.  But i FUCKING HATE Donalt Trump.
If you read Mary Trump’s book he never had to apologize to him. He was kissing his fathers ass his whole life, hoping he would love him. We now deal with daddy issues as the ‘president’
Trump Moves to Ban TikTok, WeChat From U.S., Pressuring China
Blaming Trump for banning a National security risk btw
10 more hours of Twitter jail for calling a homophobe the C word. In the meantime, Trump can lie, get people killed and be openly racist.
And mercandise for trump campaign
Reading the comments -- what will the Ds do when they can't just bleat "but Trump..." after every embarrassment?
Humility - one of Ivanka's strengths...ABSOLUTELY NOT.  This vain, arrogant, entirely self-centered.
Useful idiots can never sense irony, eh? Because thinking Biden is in cognitive decline and supporting Trump couldn't possibly be not mutually exclusive.
Trump taking on Pharma during a pandemic has to be one of the most American things a president has ever done.
Trump Isn't "Failing" on COVID Testing. He's Carrying Out a Brutal Plan. “” ... he does not want testing because he does not want the country to know how sick it is. It is the information he fears most”
Credit where it’s due - Trump did say he was going to close borders. And he did. Just everyone else’s.
yikes, when trump haters make fun of trump for mispronouncing a word, then find out he actually said it right. thailand is actually pronounced thighland
Garbage take on this election. Not supporting Biden means supporting Trump. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare
Apart from seeing President Trump sweep the floor with Biden, no.  Although Beijing Biden would be exposed for the fraud that he is!
Joe Biden says that once elected President he will not stand in the way of the Justice Department pursuing criminal charges against President Trump.
trump is probably gonna win again
I don't believe these low numbers, all the sudden  I smell a 🐀 suppressing data in the Trump admin...
How can we fight back? I left FB cause I was so mad. But then people pointed out that that’s exactly what they want  to stifle conservative voices.
We openly know that this whole thing is to help get trump re-elected and you’re feeding into it
Tell the trump campaign and Ivanka that. Get their merchandise from China.
It’s like that in Kansas, Missouri, and eastern Colorado too. Arizona is stupid for Trump, I mean stupid.
Trump has absolutely nothing to say that’s worth remembering, much less writing down.
"if we let tis Trump scumbag muthtahfuckah take over our Party, he' s gonna destroy it, an' we will have deserved that" 3 months later Graham was licking the 'THINGS' ass on the golf couse. You figger it out.
Trump signs everywhere in Ohio farm country. Though I did see a couple Biden signs yesterday.
Like I said, their chances of winning are higher than Biden's chances of actually governing to the left of trump.  And not only do you know this, it's specifically why you support him
This lie has been told by Trump 142 times.
This is insane. Trump says Biden will hurt God.
Well, trump is a full time liar so there's that
There are plenty of Trump morons in Ohio.
This is Trump everyday. Run on sentences that make no sense and never get to the point
Trump says, if Biden is elected, he will "hurt God." If Biden is that powerful, we should do what he says.
Facebook, Twitter Pull Trump Video For Spreading Bad COVID Information  via
President Donald Trump accused former Vice President Joe Biden of wanting to 'hurt God' during a stop in Ohio on Thursday.
You’re talking about Trump, right?
Give me a break. Corporate lobbyists everywhere in this administration and sweetheart deals to corporations that support trump.
Trump is the head of the Republican Party. He still has more than 90% approval among Republicans. To call yourself a Republican but not support Trump makes you look like you don’t understand what is going on
You don't understand. Trump has the secret to immortality stashed away. We've all been played.
Trump presidency has been devastating for farmers. As far as I can tell, farmers still supporting him. A version of Stockholm Syndrome?
What work? Shit for brains? Your comment doesn’t even make sense (just like Trump)! As for no evidence that it harms children or they pass it on... Really?? I know I’m probably responding to a bot ...
Kidding aside, I think this is a revealing slip. "God" is not real to Trump. "God" is churches, voters, a rhetorical hammer. If more people become atheist, or stop going to church, to Trump, "God" is hurt.
Like trump knows what a weedwhacker is.
at least when Trump plays golf, he does not shut down private clubs, public streets. And when he travels, he does not shut down public beaches for two weeks. Obama had no problem interfering with the public and ruining people's vacations
Trump also did a deposition to help put Epstein away in 2008 but you &amp; everyone else conviently forget that fact as well.
‘Trump is scared’ and ‘literally does not appear to understand’ what is going on around him: White House reporter
Good description of Trump supporters.
Trump translation: Keep that church 💰 a-funnelin'!
EXACTLY what Trump did, favoring a trade deal over COVID response. You guys literally ignore all reality. Like mad lib political ads. Just take what  did and change the name to Joe Biden to scare white women.
ITS NOT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT NOTICE. It’s NOT possible to do anything trump just said in his tweet. It’s not a thing. You cannot just change the constitution on a whim. No one is taking your guns.
The Trump administration is waging war against people of color, and you’re voting for him? Along with all of the Klansman? Along with all of the racists? I don’t get you.
That’s a whole lot of words to say nothing of truth or value. Good job ignoring what trump just said...but hey- fear a bunch of lies. Whatever makes you feel better

Unelected, unqualified and unethical.  Trump Brand.
Strategic! 👍 The Democrats won't negotiate &amp; hope to make Trump &amp; Republicans look bad. Now Trump issues executive order which may exceed his authority, so Democrats sue to take much needed benefits away from Americans.  Brilliant! 👏👏👏
I think the real question is if You like Malt Liquor. I mean, Bernie’s Friend is saying ya’all are the same.   Now imagine Trump, Ted Cruz or Lindsey Graham stating that Blacks are all the same, with a few notable exceptions.   He was probably referring to you and Nina Turner.
Honestly, you seem bored and distracted. The media can't stay focused and KEEP asking Trump the important questions because he goes and does something else. There is no comparison between a penchant to stick a foot in a mouth and an unholy shit storm of lies, stupidity, and hate
Imagine Trump, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Sean Hannity or some Fox and Friend saying all Blacks, except for a few exceptions, are all the same.  Yes, Biden Suoporters! You’re a bunch of Racist Cucks!
Bette Midler to Trump: ‘Shut the F**k Up, You Nitwit. YOU Are the Enemy of the People’
The WSJ editorial pages’ idiotic support for Trump’s kakistocracy no longer surprises. These are without doubt the dumbest, most irresponsible editorial pages in the country.
So you're saying that Biden would kill his own campaign if he were allowed to speak, but Good News For Dems, he isn't!  And in more Good News, now Trump can't rely on Biden self-destructing, which was his only hope (besides, of course, his extremely motivated base).

Are you that fucking stupid? This describes Trump down to the last letter!! And ANTIFA? Anti- fascism  yes I’ll take that! Trump is a fascist. Trump is for Trump!! Not the people. Open your eyes!
Never trust a dog hater. Trump hates dogs because "they beg" &amp; thus have no dignity. Trump has never accidentally brushed up against, nor would he recognize, dignity--even if it sank its canines into his planet-size, corrugated behind. A smashed maggot has more dignity than Tump.
Yup! And it’s bullshit! I still feel #MoscowMitchMcTreason is more dangerous and more important to replace than anyone else! Wait, Stephen Miller is next in line as well. And obviously trump. Oh fuck! Send em all out and to The Hague.

The kind of conditions trump wants to take us back to by reducing regulations. Am I right?

If you replace Trump with someone else in the scenario, the toxicity becomes obvious. Trump himself is... just a yikes, to put it nicely. But I don’t blame people for being apprehensive/ defensive about if someone is a supporter. Still, doesn’t make it ok to attack people
I’ve been through a lot of farm country this summer and there are Trump signs everywhere Mask use is spotty too.

Trump is beyond fascist he is monarchist and just straight up said it
Nope it will be the Kung flu and they will blame it on trump. More likely it will be lead poisoning !
Am I shocked that Tucker Carlson spread that unabashedly lazy false news hit piece on Mayor Berkowitz to his audience? No. Am I annoyed? Sure. The irony is not lost on me that he turns a blind eye to all of Trump’s ‘favors’ to his cronies &amp; biz interests. 🤷🏻‍♀️ but ok.
I don’t see that! Insane! All I can assume is that these idiot trump supporters are purposely reporting things as much as possible so that the system removes them. You’d think  would see mass reports and work on those immediately to see what’s going on
"We have done a lot for Alaska, it’s a special place, and I’ll take a look at that. It’s interesting," Trump said after his son tweeted his opposition to Pebble Mine.
Yes, we’ll, Ari, the President demonstrates his cognitive dissidence on an hourly basis.  For Trump’s team to raise this issue is like the pot calling the kettle black!
Now do Trump
President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump raised $4 million for his reelection campaign during a virtual event that marked her return to the high-dollar fundraising circuit.
"...the acknowledgment Republicans can't get African Americans, therefore, the need is either to suppress them or to divert them from the Democratic Party, has been at the core of Republican electoral strategy" Repubs aren't even TRYING to woo Black voters
Daymn..!!!   Maybe time for a new strategy Team Trump?
Update: Twitter temporarily bans Trump team from tweeting
That's exactly right.  I dont know how some folks have come up with Kanye taking votes away from Biden. No he won't. He'll be taking votes away from Trump  because there are some republican voters who won't vote for Trump or Biden.

Trump is Hoover #2.
I understand they want to trash Biden but can’t do it by claiming Trump doesn’t do the same stuff. Try again.
Oh totally. I’m a middle age woman and almost all the women I know are very pro Trump. I don’t believe polls that say what I want them to i believe zero polls.
Did anybody read the  article about the church of Trump in the new  ??? OMG!!!!!

FOCUS: A New Trump Rule Could Help Big Oil Crush the Climate Movement  -  ;-(
3. The Trump era has been nothing but toxic, divisive, and dangerous to our country and our community at a cellular level. It’s emboldened self-righteous stupidity, it’s fueled a warped indignation in our most racist, most uninformed people. It’ll take generations to repair this.
Twitter stopped Trump from tweeting until he removed a tweet with false COVID-19 info.
Bigger picture when I look back at the rightie tighty-whities over the last 40-some years. Trump is the result, not the cause. At least in my mind. From Gingrich to McConnell, and everyone in between. They have spent years building up to and normalizing this.
I think the Trump strategy is to reach herd immunity before any other country regardless of number of deaths. Then we can be normal economically while other countries can’t.
trump has proven himself time and time again to be the one with zero credibility.
About a month for planned parenthood, I’m sure you support the murder of innocent life
Ugh.....I absolutely hate trump. He is the worst and is going to continue to tear apart our country for the gain of the very few if left in office. But Biden is the best we could come up with to go against him?!?! Just so disappointed in our country since Obama left.

You are right about the pebble mine project.  But the Trump family has frequently shown their tendency to be congenital liars. Sen. Dan Sullivan has been a Trump sycophant. Look for actions, not words.
One day Donald Trump will disappear. Like a miracle, he will just disappear.
Nope. My Dad &amp; I were talking about Biden's VP &amp; he suggested that Biden might pick Condoleezza Rice. I replied "Hmm, idk, but that might be smart. It could sway a lot of Trump-skeptical GOPers." He then clarified that he meant *Susan* Rice, to which I replied, "oh, yeah...yuck."
every trump interview comes off like an snl sketch parody of a trump interview
Kind of like, why is it not okay for people to go to the polls so we need to delay the election, but okay to go to school, work, and gatherings. It’s called Trump knowledge.
Biden is probably praying for Trump as it is. Because as far as the election go impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump doesn’t have a prayer!
Most of the programs the Trump administration is building on were started in the Bush and Obama eras.
This MAGA cult is fucked. They rule rural farm communities RN. I’m seeing it in my recent travels. Trump signs are everywhere. We have to really make sure we get out the vote.

So, when Trump claimed it was an attack yesterday ahead of any actual intelligence, is that because his buddy Putin gave him inside information?
President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he's considering delivering his Republican convention acceptance speech from the White House after his initial plans to hold the event were foiled by coronavirus concerns and health restrictions.

I think the election is going to be a lot closer than people think it is. A lot of people are going to vote for Biden simply because he’s not Trump, similarly to 2016. But the economy is not doing well. That alone could sink Trump.
Donald Trump reads like a third grader seeing common words and names for the first time.
We don’t support a road that will cause the loss of critical caribou habitat, degrade boreal forest that is important for rare songbirds like the Blackpoll Warbler, and threaten the future of Sandhill Cranes.
Trump suffers from a narcissism so intense it’s almost debilitating , and Biden is frequently given to bizarre bouts of verbal diarrhea. And both of them frequently tell obvious demonstrable lies to make them sound better.
Because......Trump promotes it and they sure as hell can't give the impression of agreement with their hated nemesis. And...They don't want the crisis to end hoping it torpedoes Trump's chances for re-election. They don't care about the ppl.
The war they could unleash on each other would be a world ending war. Not a world war. An apocalyptic hell scape. Aside from all the other countries in chaos and disarray, and escalating tensions. Pence is a statesman and good husband, or was before he joined Trump
Germany has all kinds of white supremacists, and their country is great! For them at least, sometimes. They don’t have an out of control pandemic, and are lots of smart ppl there. Trump abandoned Germany to Russia, possibly. That internal WS versus WS.
I don’t think Biden is a closeted White supremacist. I don’t know him, I didn’t watch the debates. I just wish ppl would stop fighting. I’d honestly feel safer with VP Pence in charge right now, than Trump, even assuming he is a closeted White Supremacist. At least his not a..
I would take VP Pence as Commander and Chief right now over Trump. Say what you want about white supremacists, in their own habitat, Germany, they get stuff done. There’s plenty of Closted white supremacists in Germany, and they saved each other, and flattened the curve

Trump will Never quit or step down willingly. To think otherwise means you missed countless interviews where he stated, "I'm not a quitter. I never quit," and "I don't like to lose. I don't lose."
If you watched Trump's interview with  you'd see that  truly doesn't understand the severity of #COVIDー19.  His response to the death count was "It is what it is".  What Leader SAYS THAT?!?!?!

Watched the entire interview this evening. Trump is a Clear And Present Danger to Democracy as we know it.  He represents everything  stands for.  Frightening how far he goes to pedal falsehoods, deny scientific facts, and place blame on others.
No, he should not debate Trump.  Why should he? Trump needs the debate to help him—not the other way around.  Joe should decline.

What? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve heard yet! This is still America! No thanks to Trump! So maybe you should shut your pie hole!!
So Biden will build the United States up again from the ruins if Donald Trump

I implore all rational Democrats to really consider voting for Trump this Nov. If you vote just beacause he is not politically correct you are inviting more of the same violence, mayhem and Anti American craziness that is going on. Dont wait till it is too late!

What a P.O.S. Doesn’t he have some windsurfing to go do, or speeches to give at 250K a pop? Pretty cool when you accomplished NOTHING that Trump couldn’t undo with the stroke of a pen, lost 1200 seats, and left the party in shambles.
Right now, our country has far more important things to worry about.  155,000 + American Deaths from COVID   Millions Jobless   Trump =Incompetent

Trump allegedly threatened to kill a 13 year old girl he allegedly raped, and her whole family. Don’t think he won’t actually do it to you, someone who isn’t an aspiring 13 year old model.

Trump isn’t campaigning He’s manufacturing consent, and trying to destabilize and collapse the US so he can go full dictator   He will literally kill you, and shred the constitution to save his own temporary ass.

NPR still repeating obvious Trump lies without context or rebuttal. Somebody should be be fired for allowing such bad journalism to air. So irresponsible.

Trump banning TikTok  has nothing to do with the 1 million teenagers who punk'd him at the Tulsa rally.

i think fox ratings in general would soar to stratospheric levels ranting about the new pres. there wouldn't be enough time in the day to contain all the talk...leading to probably a trump cable tv slot to allow for even more lunatic ranting.
Trump isn’t running for re-election, he is running FROM any accountability, or the premise of accountability. He also wants to avoid comeuppance, pay back, blow back, law suits, Johnny Law, being a loser, and Jail  Just fuck everything, and hope he’s still standing at the end

Pay attention to what Trump says when reporters ask him about the election and what he’s going to do about it regarding if he’s going to except the election he said well we haven’t got there but you’ll see what I’m gonna do it’s going to be big it’s going to be big. Ffs
Trump doesn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground, but JFC, I can’t fathom the balls it must take for the gov. of the state with the most deaths by FAR, who caused God knows how many nursing home deaths, to be the one to call him out on it
More quid pro quo. The king says pay into my treasury.    Trump stuns observers by openly soliciting payment to US Treasury for his ‘approval’ of TikTok sale

When Trump drinks a glass of water, they try to indict him...
Yes, tRUMP donates his salary. Big Whoop!  By his own admission, he's making a LOT of $$ with his other investments ~ investments he Refused to give up, as required, when he took office.  Then there's the $$ Secret Service (i.e. American Taxpayers) must pay tTUMP resorts.
Trump surrogates have been saying biden will be a disaster. Hysterical if it wasn't so bad. Millions unemployed, pandemic raging with no national leadership,  international relations in the toilet. Pretty sure most Americans are not better off than 4 years ago, except the rich.
There will be a Long road ahead for U.S. COVID-19 patient recovery, with astronomical expenses to taxpayers.  Trump's Legacy will be thousands of chronically ill Americans needing healthcare.  Democrats will have to pull U.S. out of the muck. 😖
tRUMP has never read the Constitution ~ I don't believe he Understands what it means...
I'd say by the hundreds of great things he's done he is the greatest POTUS ever.   but the news refuses to talk about even one of them, brainwashing yu intellectually challenged into irrational anger, its called 'Trump derangement syndrome'  Whats your REAL issue? Get help! sigh
The trumpies I know honestly think his policies are Good.  They agree with his stance on immigration, China, and the economy.  They credit tRUMP for the booming economy &amp; stock market &amp; refuse to acknowledge that Obama put the country on the path to prosperity after a Recession.

There is still a lot of concern he is going to try and tie up the election results in court for as long as possible.  He is already laying the groundwork for that.  He is trying to deligitimize the results so his followers don’t accept his defeat.
Many of them are so focused on one issue, abortion, that they refuse to see Trump for the madman he is. Trump is capable of anything to prevent losing, including starting a war.

Actually, I've heard from a respected source that there is a good reason for banning Tik Tok. Not that Trump is doing it for this reason:  We need our tech sector to get busy and make a decent clone. I do love Tik-Tok.
I’d be sad too! I ready Mary Trump’s book- that family is BEYOND toxic
Pence is a nominally competent administrator.  He would listen to scientists, and is literate.  He probably would have pardoned trump, and found a way to shield him from state prosecution as well.   In a way, Pence would be worse, but i would guess less than 80k dead
Sounds like pipe dreams. Trump wins 2020 no matter what the media pushes forth, silencing the people, no matter if we cannot go to a rally. Reason is GOD that's right, God wins! God put Trump there in that seat to do his will. Don't like it? take it up w/ the big man upstairs.

It’s not a quincidence because they are demons. Makes from demon sperm, they are aliens and if you just listen to the smartest man in the world Trump you’d get it. He knows everything, better than everyone. Now get in line for your vaccine with tracking so we can send you ads.
Most Trump voters say they will not accept the results of election if Joe Biden wins. Naming mail-in ballots as reason.
Republicans are UnAmerican &amp; have BANKRUPTED the U.S.  Trump is Hoover #2 and presides over the 2nd Great Depression.  Trump failed at public health policy and preparations—more than 150,000 Americans DEAD from COVID under his watch.  RECORD Deficit  Trump—Incompetent, Unethical

The Polls were the same with Hillary. Voters will consider whether or not COVID-19 will be dangerous to them during November (typically flu Season) and the Democrats will likely stay home, while Anti-Science Republicans will Vote for Trump hoping to stop the Satanic Order.
Ben, I think you are overlooking the serious possibility that Trump might grab on to one of the legs of the Oval Office desk and refuse to let go. Then what?! CHECKMATE LIBS.
Pres. Trump votes by mail, as have military members since Civil War. Where’s the evidence of fraud? “Incidence of voter fraud in mail voting is about 0.00006% — about one ballot per state every six or seven years.” Your response shows the need for education—be well, Matt. #akleg

Just watched a news special re how restaurant workers are paid $2.13/Hour in many states &amp; even w/tips make poverty wages. &amp; yet...Kokomo, Indiana &amp; the state of Indiana voted for Trump in 2016. Can anyone explain WHY? WHY is the 2020 election even contestable? Incomprehensible.
That. Is. The. Sickest. Thing. I’ve. Ever. Seen. But my brother and mother think the same thing about Trump.  Jesus wasn’t playin’ when he said we are blind.
Biden can sit in his easy chair until Nov 3 and I’ll vote for him. Trump is insane and incredibly dangerous.

You might as well speak at a Trump Rally, too.
The tale of Narcissus is a warning.  Narcissus was cursed to obsess over his own perception of his "image"--transfixed by its greatness--'til he died from neglecting reality.  Trump spends all his time studying his image.  Trump neglects reality.

FUCKTARD TRUMP, your mother should have swallowed you. Just cause your finding out how many people hate you doesn't mean you get on your high horse
I’m not a fan of trump but this is the one good decision I think he’s made since he’s been potus
FUCKTARD TRUMP,  what's wrong? You mad cause no one says shit about you on Tik Tok? So you have to take it away. Your a fucking lil bitch boy. Grow the fuck up and do something other then fucking the U.S! Your a fucking bully and you need to be put in your place.
How can someone donate to Trump 2020 without going through the RNC or any other committee that supports RINOs or other nonre-election priorities?
Let me be clear. Hillary Clinton and G.W Bush are far more wicked people than Trump, in that they are Warmongers who have no problem killing Millions of People, mostly with brown colored skin.  Trump is evil for many things to be sure. But this is the problem with US Politics.
#PresidentSnowflake i dont really like tik tok, and how much data it takes, but trump banning it now is very clearly just petty retaliation to the fact that he got owned and cant maintain the perfect little illusion hes built for himself that he isnt a fucking loser
They (trump campaign) thought it would. Someone in DHS even said in an interview that pdx wax all about “creating viral content”. They want images of you guys doing stuff that looks scary. Deny them from having that! Dude trying to shut down fire is smart! Listen to him

There is a good chance Trump will succeed. He will remain in office despite the vote. And he will execute his political rivals. It's actually really common what he's doing.  Lots of us are going to die resisting him. I mean it. Lots of people.
Trump keeping another campaign promise.. American carnage  Al Franken: Trump’s handling of the pandemic ‘is the American carnage he was talking about’
Trump is an amazing forward thinker. Ex: India trade reset prior to China decouple&lt;— is an underreported massively impressive move. I am very curious to see what he is going to do. C19 cases dropping like a rock now, might be all better by then. Or vote over 3 days maybe.
The Supreme Court declined by a 5-4 vote Friday to halt the Trump administration's construction of portions of the border wall with Mexico following a recent lower court ruling that the administration improperly diverted money to the project.

People can be wooed over by crazy ideas and not be crazy. That's what is happening now. Republicans deny science, attack it, and Trump denies that there really is such a thing as truth at all.
If trump bans tik tok the nation is going to explode.

Alaskan here, Dan. You can’t have it both ways, supporting Trump’s incompetence in dealing with the virus (and everything else) while acting concerned about our health and the economy. Alaska has turned purple, show some deference to the 48% who are done with your partisanship.

No I accept what the FDA recommends based on their scientific review of trials. You just accept what Trump (a businessman) recommends at face value when giving advice on medicine. Just think about how ridiculous that is.
Every metric will be abused. Liking someone as a person  doesn't mean you think they, or the policies they represent, will be good for an important job. (In long run perspective, Hillary's was in the stratosphere. Biden's is merely awfully high, as is Trump's.)

I have a similar situation, but I'd say I had far more friends on the left than right. But, I've seen a lot of those on the left (particularly 2016 Bernie fans) turn into big Trump supporters. Nobody talks about Biden unless they are making a sniffing joke.

“Many voters who support the president live in a totally different, alternate information environment in which the news of Herman Cain’s death — his visit to the Trump rally, his decision to not wear a mask — won’t reach them.”
You are right! President Trump is terrified of the damage Joe Biden (Obama really) will do if elected. Quite frankly, so am I and a majority of Americans! What is even more scary is whom ever he chooses as VP running mate. Whom ever it is will take this country extremely far left
He is working overtime to defend Trump, it’s disgusting.
Imagine how terrifying Donald Trump would be if you buried him in the place above the Pet Sematary, where the ground is sour? I mean who would be able to tell the difference?   But still.
A shift to mail voting is increasing the chances that Americans will not know the winner of November’s presidential race on election night. But that doesn’t mean the results will be flawed or fraudulent, as President Donald Trump suggested.

Considering the “experts” have gotten it wrong on many things (fauchi mask flopping, covid patients to retirement homes...), perhaps the claim that “he isn’t a doctor” has less weight today than it used to. Trump making a management decision, influenced by experts is supported
(Narrator:   That's not at all what happened.)  Trump:  Delay Election?    Nope.  POTUS can't, won't happen.  Trump:  Glad to get MSM talking about RISKS of "mail-in".  Left MSM:   corrupt/dictator.  Right MSM:  (please forget what we said previously)
This sounds Way too much like Putin's attempt to hold office... We MUST Stop tRUMP. This is NOT Democracy in action.
18 U.S. Code § 2331.  TERRORIST LAW  28 C.F.R. 0.85  TERRORISM LAW  Which TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION ALONG with BARR and PENCE have been committing
Comments coming out of the gop on this moot topic are their way of indirectly saying they want him out. tRump has no power to delay the election. Everyone but him knows this, because he spilled coke and ketchup all over his copy of the constitution while he was busy tweeting
18 U.S. Code § 2331. Section 5 DOMESTIC TERRORISM  This is what TRUMP is doing now in these MAJOR CITIES; PORTLAND, CHICAGO, DETROIT AND OTHERS,  28. C.F.R. 0.85 of the FEDERAL code on TERRORISM  Both have the death penalty or JAIL and $10,000 fine  or both
I AGREE, Senator. Thank you.  Now, please choose to represent Americans and disavow trump. #AmericaOrTrump
Unfortunately, Trump meets hate with hate.  His speeches &amp; Tweets deride the Dems, and anyone who disagrees with him.  Both Dems &amp; Repubs are at an impasse &amp; not working together.  We need new Leadership, &amp; Trump's tone is NOT unifying.  Why would you vote 4 more years of this?
TRUMP is more than petty he is a FULL BLOWN TERRORIST who does TERRORISM UNDER THE LAW  18 U.S. Code § 2331. Section 5  DOMESTIC TERRORISM
Agree. Thanks for the dialogue.  Do you think Trump's words and Tweets add to racial tension, police brutality, and mis-information regarding COVID?
How come your not dead yet? If Trump is who you say he is shouldn’t you be wearing goggles and a mask? Why not scuba gear and a plastic bubble. We are onto the scam. Take a hike....
Even if you manage to rig the election in your favor. Keep in mind the Democrats will win the Senate have power over the house and you will be impeached again. The Trump clown show is coming to an end.
Trump is on a path to change Alaska's environment more than any other state. This article focuses on Pebble mine, Ambler Rd and Tongass NF, but the administration also is making significant changes to the NPRA and the Arctic Refuge. #akleg
Even a rat will turn on you when it’s cornered. These are the words of a desperate scared individual. You know the end is near and you will do everything in your corrupt mind to prevent the end evitable. America is done with you impeach failure liar 45th president Donald J Trump.
Agree.Were you objective w/Obama? I was. Please list Trump accomplishments I see huge racial divide,greatest DROP in GDP (several times over), sky-rocketing Deficit &amp; Unemployment.  And when the tax break trump signed for middle-income Americans expires, our taxes will go Way Up.
Alaska’s Energy Desk reports that the largest U.S. national forest will probably be impacted by the Trump administration’s recent revisions to the National Environmental Policy Act.
The limb ALWAYS seems to get lobbed off behind them.  Must be some really good fruit, or they like looking like DOLTS.  (or Trump likes making them look like DOLTS).
I smell a coup . trump will not leave without a fight .
The more  and other media outlets even question something that is laid out plainly in the constitution, the more traction you will give tRump in trying to intervene in americans' right to vote on nov 3rd..stop with these ridiculous polls. Its moot
Just like Obama did. But got blamed for giving trump a bad turn over🤦🏽‍♂️
If you are a trump supporter I don’t understand how the hell you can support that pos.
Fuck trump
Yes.  Protesters need to get smart and go home when these guys arrive. Trump thrives on chaos.
Thank god Dr Fauci didn’t require masks for  dogs . If Trump had one, the dems would have made it mandatory
Yes, Trump supporters are absolutely stupid, 100% without question.
Trump floated delaying the November election. Here’s what Alaska’s congressional delegation says about that.
All the evidence you need to know about Barr licking trump’s boots.
Puerto Rico is fucked trump doesn't think they are part of America.  trump is now willing to hurt non racist white people in Portland brown people in Rico are doomed.
Sadly, I don’t see it happening. I wouldn’t put it past Biden to forgive Trump all his transgressions “in the interest of unity” ala President Ford and Nixon
Obama out here giving us verbal gymnastics. Some time today trump will stand in front of a mic a say i had a bigg-lee-rrrrr crowd the size no one ever seen before.
It’s pretty common among tin-pot dictators and fascists. Right down to the use of repetition, changes in tone and pace, and other speech patterns. A lot of what they say is nonsensical.  A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
When Moscow Mitch rejects Trump's nonsense, you know it's some next-level nonsense!
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   18 U.S. Code § 2331 Section 5 Also STATES that this ACT is  DOMESTIC TERRORISM  TRUMP PENCE and the ADMINISTRATION are TERRORIST
Herman Cain just died after catching COVID-19 at a Trump anti-mask rally a couple weeks ago
'We will not be leaving' Portland until 'safety' is restored: Trump   Under 28CFR 0.85 THIS IS THE ACT OF TERRORISM
Man trump has like 250 pounds on Obama.
My statement wasn’t why you thought Trump was dangerous, that’s too loaded of a question &amp; not fair to ask, I agree. You said he was the reason or createated (can’t remember which)Antifa &amp; BLM. I’m very confused by that since they are both Democratic groups.
The bounds of Trump's narcissism and quest for absolute power are truly frightening. This is the kind of rhetoric one would expect to see in Russia, North Korea, China, etc., but not in the United States of America. Trump is a menace. I'm quite scared.
Trump 2020
How have we sunk so low that trump is president? Watching President Obama giving John Lewis eulogy brings tears to my eyes.
I have a son who lives in Germany!! Believe me... Trumps working for Putin!! When has Trump ever been hard on Putin or Russia??!!!
Sounds like a threat but I’ll still be voting TRUMP
Your support of Trump is why you’re still at McDonalds! Stupid is... as stupid does!
President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, both promise sweeping progress over the next four years — via starkly different paths.
They’re all afraid of Trump! Stupid asses should have voted him out of office at impeachment! Boom fear gone!!
I’m glad Trump wasn’t there. He didn’t deserve to be.
Herman Cain dies after contracting the Coronavirus, most likely at Trump's rally in Tulsa.
Cain loaded and handed the gun to trump . He deserves no pity
Yes!! Trump is lair, crazy, sick man! 🐍
Trump tweet about delaying election is just a tactic to make today about himself and not John Lewis and the praise he is getting from 3 former presidents and other dignitaries
US, BRAZIL, and INDIA. WE are in the same bracket as those countries in regard to covid infections. Jfc. Never thought we’d see the US in the same sentence in this type of failure. Ebola would have killed half of us had it hit w Trump running the country. That’s one thing to
Blow smoke up someone elses ass!! We already know it’s the Republicans! Lying and covering your asses. You people,thank God will be gone soon! Unbelievable! The Democrats have been fighting for the people to survive this pandemic. Not Trump!!
Donald Trump tweets desire to delay the election.
Why does a billionaire hang out with a pedophile especially after he was convicted? all pictures of Trump with Epstein are before his conviction and before Trump kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago for attempting to mess with a minor.
Yankees surprised by Trump announcing plans to throw first pitch without invite: NYT
Trump jr. Proves his irrelevance.   Donald Trump Jr. launches Twitter attack against “Democrat” Barbie
Factbox: What would it take to postpone the U.S. presidential election?  Even if Congress decided to delay the election, Trump’s presidential term would still end at noon on Jan. 20, 2021, a date that is set in the Constitution’s 20th Amendment.
Well, this explains the tweets by Trump on the election delay.  Any distractions, now matter how asinine, still distracts from this bleak news.
(28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). People NEED to know the TRUTH about what is TERRORISM TRUMP and his ADMINISTRATION is doing
American People what TRUMP is doing in PORTLAND, CHICAGO and other cities is the ACT OF TERRORISM; As well as the fact that he is doing the ACTS OF A DICTATOR which is in VIOLATION of the CONSTITUTION; TRUMP, PENCE, THEIR ADMINISTRATION, ALLIES AND BARR
Federal agents show stronger force at Portland protests despite order to withdraw    This PROVES that HOMELAND SECURITY AND BORDER CONTROL/CUSTOMS ARE NOTHING BUT LIARS AND WILL BREAK THE LAW FOR TRUMP THE DICTATOR
I think Trump thought he could actually kill off voters that wouldn’t vote for him! Now it’s Republican states and his people are dying and he’s freaking out!!
Let me put this as succinctly as I can: f*ck this guy | Trump floats November election delay, but it won't happen - KTVA 11 - The Voice of Alaska
Trump is a big fat idiot wrapped up in a moron. You don't got a clue how to lead. You are a coward. You are the worst president ever; you are the biggest embarrassment the world has ever seen. Stop being a whiny crybaby and take it like man.
He’ll get better ratings then Trump! That’s the way Trump will see it anyway!
Trump killed Herman Cain.
Why Trump Might Quit  via
Red with embarrassment for supporting Trump!!
It's not clear when or where Cain was infected, but he was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa
Trump is bumping off all members with this virus this is his warfare and you allow this
The dates of presidential elections — the Tues. after the first Mon. in Nov. in every 4th  year — are enshrined in federal law &amp; would require an act of Congress to change. The Constitution makes no provisions for a delay to the Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration.
You read the Bible? Does the Bible  promote Donald Trump’s racist views? Does the Bible support your racist tweet?! Are you saying poor people don’t work?! Ask Christ about poor people! Dumbass! Jesus would agree!
He died from the Trump Tulsa super spreader strain. What does he win Johnny?
Trump said 100,000 to 200,000 deaths would be a success. As countries have flattened the curve, didn’t go broke, didn’t ruin their economy, and didn’t have mass death.  This was preventable, and ruin was avoidable. Making it worse was optional, and that’s exactly what Reps did
So also, can we stop mocking the people who are preparing for the possibility that Trump won't leave office when he loses?
What are you high on? If you’re such a great President with a silent majority, what are you afraid of?? What’s fraudulent and inaccurate is this ridiculous lie you’re telling to steal an election!! The great embarrassment is Donald Trump!!
Thoughts? Should the election be delayed?  There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud through mail-in voting, even in states with all-mail votes.
Trump floats delaying the election, but he can't do that  via
trump wishes he could delay the election by executive order.
Trump for the first time floats a “delay” to November’s presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that mail-in voting will result in fraud
Hooray for redlining and segregation! Looks like Trump takes after his old man. This is just a personal vendetta from the time he was charged for discriminatory housing practices.
I’m sure I’ll be corrected if I am wrong but I believe this is the first time we’ve seen President Trump call for a delay in the upcoming elections. Expect reaction from all sides to follow.
Trump is trying to interfere in our elections.
After nearly four years without one, the U.S. State Department again has a top-level official devoted to Arctic issues
Trump and his allies respond with pseudo-science as US death toll hits 150,000.
Now the MAGATS take over, inspired by the secret soldiers sent by Trump and his Wolf
PS I also respect the fact that you don’t like Trump.  He’s not everyone’s cup of tea.   I can’t stand Trudo.  I think he’s a two faced out for himself man as well.
Those deaths are Trump's responsibility. He wants to be the all-powerful, but he doesn't want to take any responsibility. If he had treated this pandemic seriously, he would have marshaled all the great US forces. Instead, he hindered, at every chance.
Hey, where's the Russian bots and Trump supporters?
Fauci is key member of the Deep State plot staging this Plandemic to create a crisis, establish mandatory vaccines, make Big Pharma and Bill Gates even wealthier, assert greater government control, and remove President Trump.
It appears to be the effects of a TIA --transient ischemic attack, or in common parlance, mini stroke.  In Trump's case, some/much of the related pathology has not resolved.
Trump's pulling troops out of Germany is a PAYMENT to Putin. It is a payment for Putin to put EVERYTHING THE RUSSIANS HAVE into subverting the November election.
She said she thought Trump had learned his lesson, and so she didn't vote to remove him. Look where that had gotten us. Either she is an idiot, or she was lying and don't care what befalls this country. Or both. She has to go.
Yes it is RACISM AND IT SHOWS THAT TRUMP IS ALSO A WHITE SUPREMACIST and in my opinion he is also part of the NEO NAZI MOVEMENT,  TRUMP IS A DICTATOR JUST LIKE ADOLF HITLER was during WWII
Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(2)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.) So by FEDERAL LAW WHERE TRUMP IS ADDING RUSSIA IT IS TREASON AND PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR IMPRISONMENT
she is living proof that ignorance is bliss and denial an even greater sign she suffers from 'TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, cognitive dissonance, false equivalencies and the appearance she's in a childlike fantasy world. are any dems sane? help us God!
This shows the true TRUMP he is nothing but RACIST AND WANT TO SEGREGATE AMERICA AND TAKE US BACK 60 YRS
Trump is crippling NATO as a favor to Putin. This and Brexit Putin's long game. He wants chaos in the West. Trump gives him even more than he asks for.
So Kavanaugh and giving Trump a pass are in Maine's best interest? I don't think so. #GOPComplicitTraitors
TRUMP is a TERRORIST and TRAITOR to AMERICA and the REPUBLICAN SENATORS let him get away with the CRIMES
I have never understood anyone who is faithful to God backing Trump.  He had never seen or held a bible before he campaigned. Well maybe in a hotel room drawer.  Even talking about him makes me want to take a shower.
Without Democrat fraud he may. That’s why everyone who supports him, regardless of the state they live in needs to go out and vote!  I’ve heard IL and even NY has increasing Trump support. Alaska sure does.
Wow it’s the week for devils and demons! Trump must be so proud his makeup fell off.
July 19th (which feels like 5 years ago at this point) trump said:  "We're signing a healthcare plan within two weeks, a full and complete healthcare plan,"  That was 10 days ago.   There is no plan. But he’s glad he says so much stupid shit that no one will even question this.
is a rubber stamp for all things Trump.  Get him outta there!
The report gives recommendations for these problems, specifically encouraging 6 feet of social distance and for people to wear a cloth face covering indoors.
I personally would like an Alaskan to represent me in Washington, not a Ohio plant in Trump’s pocket. I’m voting for Dr Al Gross
I don’t even know what to say about this.   Trump administration COVID-19 task force urges #Alaska to require masks for seafood plants and hot spots - Anchorage Daily News
Now would be a good opportunity for Trump and his side to prove that hydroxichloriquine works. Maybe they don’t even believe what they say.
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill for a long-delayed modernization of the West Wing.
Proposed effective date for NEPA update is 9/14/20, subject to congressional (and presumably judicial) review. Based on EO 13807. Trump started gloating 3, maybe even 5 years too early.
I'v donated to your opponent and I don't even live in ME!  ME deserves more than a TRUMP STOOGE!!!
He was tested in a pre-screen at the White House before a scheduled trip to his home state with President Donald Trump.
Just like Biden said “you ain’t black”
There is a lot more to say about Biden and Harris but would you listen?
U vote for everything that is wrong inthis country? What has Biden done? Made his son &amp; family members rich w/ deal from China &amp; Ukraine. What has Harris done for this country? Locked Black men up for life over weed &amp; withheld evidence that would free a man on death row,
I’m right there with your mom. Always a conservative, but not alway R, registered independent. Trump has radicalized me so far Left I’m ready to literally die to vote for Biden/Harris. #GenXmomsforBiden
This isn’t even a mediocre effort at a diversion tactic. The President is in front of the American people almost daily. We don’t see Biden for more then 3 minutes at a time. Sometimes in a week. How can that be ok with anyone?
You have a right to your opinion. I'm thinking of the enormous amount of damage that could be done by another Trump term. In spite of Biden's faults, I don't think he's a wannabe dictator. And Kamala Harris really helps the ticket.
It’s simple! Don’t Vote for Biden or support Yuppie Asshole Sellout Democrats. Their days are over! It’s time to stir up some major shit and agitate like hell! Revolution is in the air!
Is it Anonymous policy to throw comrades under the bus to save themselves AKA abandon victims of Scientology? And you criticize Biden for not doing more to help victims? Hypocrites. Cowards. BTW, Anon has an ableist problem- might wanna do something about that, "freedom fighter".
What do you mean just like Biden??
Take a shot every time Bernie endorses the ticket. And another one every time one of you says, “Biden and Trump are the same.” Or “The movement is bigger than Bernie.”
Kamala Harris believes that Joe Biden sexually assaulted women. She's on the record
I'm beating a dead horse, but I keep bringing up Scientology and the truth about them being a cult, because there are plenty who criticize Republicans, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Democrats, Putin, CCP, etc. Anonymous criticizes all.  Who criticizes Scientology? Besides Leah Remini?
You can twist &amp; squirm, tell lies, hypnotize him, drug him, rehearse in for hours &amp; hours, but FACTS R, Hidin' Joe Biden' looks like a wax figure, READS from notes, refuses any interviews, walks like zombie, has dementia &amp; should B in a home! R U CRAZY?  Elderly ABUSE, NO DOUBT!!

joe biden is not flexible on policy. how on earth could you think he is
Only if Trump were to win. Biden/Harris winning would make up for a LOT of 2020 misery.
Biden sold us t China #trump t us out of the war and now they are with us against Iran  in peace .Obama  sold us to Iran and kept the war going to tear our military down t nothing and raked in millions for him self then gave Iran 5.5 billion to Iran soooo your  we’re saying
I already requested a mail-in ballot a month ago so I could vote for Joe Biden and maybe make Benedict Ronald McFrump unhappy, since he's killing the American dream for millions.   Thank you, Trump, for the stimulus check- I bought a #GoJoe button with it. #SaveUSPS #BidenHarris
You talk like Joe Biden won’t be around much longer.
The voters are left an joe biden is right of Trump
And this is what Hillary would do to Biden just so she could be POTUS. (From House of 1000 Corpses)
There are two Fascists running against each other who hate Black People.  You have fun picking between the two, cause Biden is the One who made sure Blacks stay in Jail for good.  Those of us who aren’t Suckers have a Revolution to start!
Biden will not save us from anything. In fact, be prepared for more Wars, likely with Iran and Venezuela, which is the real reason the Establishment/Resistence hates Trump so much.   The Manufacturering Consent is on behalf of the Military Industrial Complex.
Bring it. You may be useful yet. Biden will get us into WW3 for the sake of Israel.
If Biden takes the White House, Progressives are sure to be kneecapped until 2032.   We must either seek 3rd Party or just plain ole Revolutionary Tactics. The Democratic Party is poison.
😀 This is good, VERY GOOD❗️😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Every time a liberal asks you why hasn’t Trump done this or that! Ask them why Obama and Biden didn’t do it! Then tell them President Trump will get to it! - Join the conversation on
You cut up a bunch of video clips to make things fit. The President works harder than most and comes back the next day. All you have to do with Biden is leave the camera and mic on for 5 minutes. If he’s allowed to speak at all.
I hope 2021 can be Absinthe (with Joe Biden as our President).
Great Song With Truth Message-No Biden (Original Song)  via
This man is a terrorist using his money to cause division in this country.  He has bought Biden &amp; Harris.  Harris has let it slip that if elected she will do an executive order to take our guns.  I did not know vp’s can do that only presidents,
Absolutely!All our energy should be on voting for Biden.  Then we can dump him off to the side or go after him.  If Biden is elected, so much goes in to fixing the mess he made for the American people and with our allies. It will keep him and us busy for  the first four years.
Wow! Together, we can Fight the Power as we enter a Brave New World. Joe Biden is the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz, and Trump in the Tinman. Amerikkka is the Evil Empire from Star Wars.  We need to be all new Characters!!
Do you know if there is a backup plan for when Donald Trump refuses to leave office if we had a legitimate election where Joe Biden is the clear winner? Is there a plan for if Trump refuses to leave? What if he uses direct force, and murders congressmen to retain the White House?
Is that you SMH? campaining for Joe Biden? Be careful what you wish for.....
Inappropriate, unconstitutional, treasonous... Alaskans, let’s vote Biden. I know the GOP likes to scare us that 2A is in danger, but it’s not. 2A will be fine. It always is. Plus nothing is worse than this unpatriotic traitor.
Biden a racist? I will refrain from additional remarks. Are you a Russian bot? A trump supporter?

Today's #FederalBudget Note| Even before COVID, federal deficits were on track to &gt; $1T/yr. Trump proposes to reduce revenues even further (w/o offsetting spending cuts); Biden proposes to raise revenues (but w/ spending increases). NEITHER is helpful.
Many people see Biden suffers cognitive issues and media is trying to cover for him. Neither will take questions from reporters at events. He makes racist remarks. She culturally appropriates as African-American when she isn’t. Dems continue to be the party of racism and hate.
LOL.  Right along the lines of "Biden is not capable of debating" to "Biden is a stellar debater".   HAHAHA     Trump is like a pane of glass.
Trump and Biden the same mf. USA u are f****d.
The National Association of Letter Carriers represents 300,000 people. It said Trump has long been hostile to the Post Office, calling for an end to collective bargaining rights, proposing service cuts and eyeing the possibility of privatizing the agency.
We were already going to vote for Biden!  I refer you to the Women's March that occurred when this administration began!  We haven't forgotten.
Michael Cohen has no credibility. But even Kamala Harris believes the most recent sexual assault victims of Joe Biden.
Joe Biden’s hypocrisy exposed
Dear NRI community in USA. Stay away from Joe Biden and Kamla. 🙏
Are you doing endorsement ads for Biden/Harris now? Seems off-brand.
If you are in the middle of a disaster, are you going to be picky about who rescues you?  We picked Biden to offer a middle road alternative to people like you.  We are trying here, meet us in the middle.
So he said Mandatory for three months because of the election Joe Biden is already starting to be a dictator he has no authority to do so and I’m telling you don’t do it you wear your mask inside only an outside no he wants more people to die
President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked Joe Biden for calling on governors to mandate that all Americans wear masks for the next three months.
Biden’s Busing Blues.   ‘It was just a bus’
YouTube is desperately trying to help elect Joe Biden president
They lead by example &amp; I hope that shows people the difference between Biden &amp; Trump.  Y do we still have an electoral college?Hilary would have been our President since she won by popular vote, but lost to Trump due to the electoral college.I hope history does not repeat itself.
The debate over masks has moved to the presidential race.
Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate
My vote will go to the most conservative of the candidates.  My vote will go to the devout catholic.  My vote will go to the gun owner.  My vote is for a science based approach to the pandemic. My vote is for racial &amp; gender equality.  My vote is for Biden/Harris. #BidenHarris
Thank you team Biden Harris #BidenHarrisAdministration
Tweeting is nice, but more important:  VOLUNTEER.  This is how we get a Biden/Harris win!  #BidenHarris
This is why high voter turnout is KEY.  We HAVE to outnumber these voters. We all need to volunteer  the local level for get out the vote help. Local volunteering, all across the U.S., will ensure a Biden/Harris win!!  #BidenHarris2020
If Progressives continue with the Establishment in the Democratic Party, the Movement could be squashed till 2032.  It’s time for us to try a different Route and use force if necessary.  Biden/Harris is a travesty.
I’m surprised that Biden is still alive. I think he’s had a stroke or something. There’s at least a 50% chance he dies in Office.  The GOP will implode Post Trump. The Free Traders are gone, and it’s like Pat Buchanan somehow took over the Party with his views.   Who knows?
i want to support biden but i can’t get over those vids of him grabbing young girls and sniffing their hair! #CreepyJoeBiden
There is nothing left to talk about. Progressives speaking on behalf of Biden make me sick. It’s time to fight the System with force. Talk is cheap. I’m done asking nicely! Fight the Powers that Be!
Same place they make Biden. Some machine made by the KKK.
All the Bushies are with Biden now, so piss off Fascist Clown!
Better than being in the George W Bush fan club with Bill Kristol, David Frum, Carl Rove and the rest of your Genocidal Friends who now are in love with Biden.
I think Biden &amp; Harris have been wearing their masks 24/7.  Breathing their own carbon monoxide has damaged their brain &amp; their way of thinking. The Democrats keep pushing &amp; we will have a Civil War.
Stand for something or we are all moving on. Many of us are Voting 3rd Party because the Democrats are pointless. I like the few real Progressives, like you, who are fighting with all their might against the Corruption.  But We will NOT tolerate Biden or Cuck 1% Demon Dems!
I was so moved when She showed us that Biden is a Racist Asshole.
Bad take Brother West. I doubt Malcolm-X would find any hope in a Biden Presidency, whatsoever. Place wake up!!
Biggest load of crap I ever heard.  Biden said MOST votes &amp; voices in America matter, he is pos, a crook, liar, racist &amp; has abused power of his office.  Who does he pick as his vp another pos, crook, liar, racist, has abused power of her office
Just remember that Biden and Trump are basically Nazis.   I mean....who said that Blacks are all the same? David Duke or Joe Biden?
BIDEN ISNT A SCIENTIST! BIDEN ISNT A PRESIDENT! Trump is. Now eat 💩
Joe Biden calls for national mask mandate. Because that's what leaders do.
needs to put together a video of Biden and Harris walking up and down ramps. #TrumpIsUnwell
And it only took a couple of minutes for Lyin-Biden to come out and try to take credit for the corrupt Obama administration!
Ever watch one of the many videos of racist Biden sniffing or  grabbing children? How about Biden’s most recent accusers of sexual assault. Kamala said she believed those women.
I just watched Joe Biden on camera being asked the question and he said that everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside everybody should be mandated to wear a mask outside
She is a liar a smear of innocent people she hates everybody that is not her she spews hatred out of her mouth every time she opens it if people vote for her and Joe Biden I don’t know what this country is going to look like because it won’t look like America our freedoms gone
Because President Trump only speaks the truth he’s never told anybody a lot about anybody and Carmella Harris is a pothead lying liberal left Democrat Joe Biden poor man has dementia
These people of You want to call him that are cahooyinh with China Pelosi said it herself in an interview she said China would prefer Biden if that isn’t colluding I don’t know what it is
Biden isn’t the fucking president!!
At least they've finally stopped railing on Biden for never having had a boat parade. That was devastating, let me tell you.
Make America great again.  Vote Biden?
They are really threatened by this woman!! That tells me how good she really is! I’m voting Biden /Harris!
I will never forget how she decididly and unequivocally knocked his dick into the dirt.  That is why I am happy she is Biden’s running mate.
Joe Biden is calling for a nationwide protective mask mandate, citing health experts’ predictions that it could save 40,000 lives from coronavirus over the next three months.
They’re cracking the whip as the Plantation Owners defending the Interests of the 1%.  And anyone who defends Biden has Stockholm Syndrome.
if you believe you can bully Biden to the left I’m gonna bully you until you’re a ML

Franklin Graham warns Biden-Harris ticket ‘should be a great concern to all Christians’  #FoxNews   These are the same 'Christians'   that claim to be 'Pro-Life'.
As long as the Republican Party has the Senate Majority, Biden (or any Democrat) will be basically powerless. We saw it with Obama and the Affordable Care Act.
I bet most of the people saying they’re voting for Biden so they can “hold him accountable” don’t even know what Senate seats are up for grabs in November. Or how important it is to flip the Senate.
Impeached failure 45th president Donald J Trump was beaten in a landslide victory by the Biden Harris administration. It was a landslide defeat like no other election has seen in the history of the electoral college. #Bye-byeDumbAssTrump
The Senate has the real power not the president and y’all can’t even hold your senators accountable now so what makes you think you’ll be able to hold Biden accountable later?
Why don’t y’all hold your elected officials accountable and make them stay in session until they reach a deal? Or do y’all just plan on holding Biden accountable once he’s president?
I second this opinion please get out n vote. That’s why they make the polls looks like Biden has it by a landslide . So people will just give up
I first read that as "Biden uses PUNS as an inspirational example..."  Almost had me there.
I'm depressed about this. What good is voting for Joe Biden if Donald Trump steals the election anyway? It would feel like a pointless exercise in democracy rather than the real thing.
Biden-Harris ticket will save our country from this MAD man, and right wing conspiracy theory media people like yourself.  #TrumpFailedAmerica  #Covid_19
Every single American should be wearing a mask when they’re outside for the next three months at a minimum.'
Joe Biden can say whatever he wants- until Joe's in the White House, his words have no weight and are therefore meaningless.  Remove. Trump. to. save. democracy. NOW.  #ImpeachHimAgain #CensureTrump
Supports Joe Biden’s sexual assault of Tara Reade!
Anyone who says Biden has done more harm than Trump is a damned fool.
Trump: If Biden gets elected, he's gonna crash the economy  The economy:
You and Biden just asked for a national mask mandate. This gives citizens an idea of how your first response is to step to over-reaching Control of the people.
Biden and Harris if ever was voted in would be the hypocritical xenophobic bigoted corrupt traitors in chiefs in the Demonrats country were laws are none existent if you break any nothing happens because: “No laws for me but for the.”
So someone in Russia created an "Antifa" website and linked it to Joe Biden's campaign. Weird.
Fuck joe Biden
Next line of attack:   Joe Biden would just be a puppet of the Trump agenda. Is he actually Trump? Where's his birth certificate showing that he's not Donald Trump? Shouldn't we stay the course rather than risk electing Donald Trump?
How can GOP question Joe Biden's faith when they support a faux Christian ammoral dictator for president
Biden was involved in extrotion from Ukraine and Obamogate.
The next Biden-Harris campaign ad.
If Biden puts out nothing but reviews of sick cars for the rest of this election run up I’ll vote for him.
It feels like Kamala is running for President not Biden
Not a single drug company sponsored ad supporting Biden/Harris has aired in Alaska or Chicago.
They all need to be rallying people to vote every single day, and to support not just the Biden/Harris presidency but also to denounce Trumpism and vote out every Trump sycophant enabler in every election.   #BidenHarris  #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Does this mean that the model says that Biden has a 3% chance of getting 470+ electors?
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate
And when Biden &amp; Harris continue to allow police to run rampant, continue to limit us to ineffective half-measures against the pandemic because full measures are "too expensive", &amp; refuse to bail out anyone who isn't a billionaire, guess who they'll want in 2024?  Someone else.
Biden will likely win not because people appreciate the Democratic party's "restraint" in avoiding "too much" responsibility to the population, but rather because the pandemic, police brutality, &amp; economic collapse are causing people to simply want "someone else" in charge
Joe Biden raised $26 million in the 24 hours after he named Kamala Harris as his running mate.
Thank you, Dr. Biden. Social Security is vital to retired and disabled Americans.  But why not expand Social Security for all? We can give everyone a monthly income, irregardless if they have a disability or have advanced in age.  #SocialSecurityForAll #UBI #UniversalBasicIncome
The Government is the people. The White House is just a building. Trump won’t leave? So what? Turn the power off. Turn the water off. Biden can live somewhere else and govern just fine. For that matter we can blow it up and build anew. Trump has tainted that house anyway.
Yes ma’am ... very thrilled with his choice and I think they will make a great team !! Go Biden
If you when, this nation will be divided even more than it is now!!  You are just a puppet on the string.  Hidin’ Biden!!
Kamala Harris Is Perfect  - REEEeeeee Stream  via  More black peoples killed by #blm than cops this year. No Biden! These racists, bad #communists #Marxism #racist #front #wolfsinsheepswool
watching my friends go from "WOO FUUUUCK YEAH BERNIE" to "ugh fine i'll vote biden" has been fun to watch
So his long will it take to get the Biden Harris year I just ordered?  #USPSisEssential
With Kamala on the ticket I feel good. Biden's experience and her energy and new ideas, I'm finally excited.  In 2016 I wanted to stop Trump. This one is so much more than that. This is about stopping Trumpism and sending a message to the world.  We're back!! #BidenHarris2020
I want biden to lose just to see the Khive meltdown and also the Democrats really deserve it
I don't think we have to back burner it at all, if anything we need to push for progress harder. Biden was the wrong pick imo, but all over the country progressives are winning, and pollijg indicates the majority of voters are on that side of policy.
I thought Biden was at least a smarter politician than that. Of all the years to put in a cop as VP, this was probably not the year.
I assume you’re taking Biden where a cognitive decline is concerned.
Amen to that! Biden isn’t  my choice but it is THE choice I will go with to save America. To save children stolen from their parents at the border and thrown into cages. The choice I will pick to hopefully save millions of lives from death by covid. For OUR FUTURE as a republic.
Sure shows Biden in great shape!  Unlike an obese person!
I thought it was a parody. But Biden and Harris are promoting this. Not a great look for either of them.
She was nasty towards Biden she was very nasty and he told the true that she was very nasty towards biden they are evil and vile towards trump and they tell lies as they do so but trump told the truth I watched it she was nasty towards biden
Fear, violence and trauma is what the Democrats are unleashing where they govern. Biden/Harris is bad for business, bad for freedom, bad for security and safety.
Now that it's official and Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his VP, I'm wondering how  is feeling. If she could turn back time, do you think she would have claimed she was 1/1064th African American if it would help her secure a nomination?
You can’t starve a nation of decency for so long and expect us to listen to your toxic drivel. Especially not after getting what we need from Biden and Harris.
Elizabeth is keeping her promise through Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala.
Can Kamala Harris and Joe Biden Defeat Trump?
Oh please. Who has gone to the Supreme Court to overturn the ACA. It's not Biden. Trump wants to do away with healthcare, social security and medicare. Desparation makes you kue more
And if you’re not abstaining from voting or voting third party, then what is ripping Kamala apart accomplishing other than advancing a conservative agenda? Once elected, we can demand better from Biden/Harris, but criticizing them now only helps Trump.
To clarify, Biden is absolutely not remotely my number one choice and I recognize Kamala’s controversial past. It’s just baffling to me that we’re debating their backgrounds with civil rights given who they’re up against...it should be a no brainer
The fact that they're attacking Biden for being a Muslim/Sharia law-bringer makes me feel 5% less bad about them attacking Obama for it.
So if biden were president,  there'd be no deaths? How can you be so ignorant?
In  First speach with Biden. Close to quoting as I can: [Trump] inherited one of the strongest economies in history. Like everything else he’s inherited, he’s driven it into the ground. #burn #truth
Watching Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and i'm not gonna lie, it's giving me a feeling of hope for our country that I haven't felt in a LONG time. #VoteBidenHarris2020
Trump had the HIGHEST EMPLOYMENT RATE of EVERY RACE in US HISTORY!! We had a thriving economy until the pandemic. You’re delusional. Biden said as soon as he’s president he going to get busy undoing everything Trump did. As a Mexican woman &amp; small business owner, this scares me.
Watching this Biden/Harris event. Kinda forgot what coherent, articulate leadership sounds like.
I’m working from home, listening to Biden and Harris give hope back to an emotionally threadbare nation.  It is a good day.
President Biden and Vice President Harris.🇺🇸
America already knows...that you will not find a jacket with "I really don't care" written on the back...hanging in Dr. Jill Biden's closet. #FirstLady  #BidenHarris2020
Biden is still the lead. You didn't make America great again. You made it worse!
Can we have a tee-shirt made for Kamala that reads "Thx Donald &amp; Ivanka for the campaign donation"...and then have her wear it on the night (fingers crossed) she and Biden win? 😛 #BidenHarris2020
Donald Trump dislikes Joe Biden's new running mate so much that he donated more than once to her campaigns.
both trump and biden suck ass, but biden is the lesser of the two evils. he’s the one who will most likely listen to us and do what we, as a country, ask him too. both of them are absolutely horrendous, but we have to get trump out before he does more damage.
Good thing it’s Biden.. how would you have impersonated anyone else? 😂
We don't. we're concentrating on putting criminals like Comey, Strozk/Page, Mueller, Schiff, HRC, H. Biden, 3-4 RINOS, 12+ libelous news folk, et al, in jail. Then expose Obama, Biden, Rice et AL 4 illegal acts against mR Trump &amp; Gen Flynn! Wha?? you're not laughin' now, Bob???
You see Biden’s cognitive decline as your opportunity to become President.
President Trump was asked about Joe Biden's VP pick, Sen. Kamala Harris at Tuesday evening's coronavirus press briefing. The president said, "...we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries..." and that he was "a little surprised that he picked her."
A Biden presidency is not objectively good; it does literally nothing to solve any of the problems we’re currently trying solve in America; that’s all I’m saying; obviously I’m voting Biden Sam I’m not an idiot, but it’s not a revolutionary act
Yes but the people who are specifically oppressed under Trump won’t stop getting oppressed under Biden, so it doesn’t matter; the only actions that matter are ones that will actually work against systemic oppression
And it will be effectively the same under Trump again or Biden; that’s our privilege
#Biden choosing #Harris as his running mate is a wink to white capitalists that he doesn't give a fuck about police brutality
Happy to have  in Alaska visiting our beautiful state! He went on record with  discussing how the #BidenHarris ticket could be disastrous for #energy workers here and across the US. Biden would end leasing on federal lands - goodbye #ANWR!  Fight on, Ted!
Russia doesn’t want Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to win in November. They should be elected on this issue alone.
I can understand voting for Biden over Trump all day long, but I cannot abide voter shaming. Its a form of abuse.  Appeal to nonvoters. Reason with nonvoters.
This past weekend I was riding bikes over on the Campbell creek trails and saw a person standing in the middle of the woods with 24x36 United for Biden sign.
The big one being corporate sellout. Biden is also clearly a classist who Isn't willing to listen to the working class which you can see in many interviews he's done where he'd rather insult someone than answer a question/concern that is brought up. Yes I know trump does the same
If y'all need to tell yourselves that Biden/Harris is a great ticket to make what we have to do in November less distasteful then go for it, but trying to chill speech about how they are not utter trash is really wierd imo
Not a good pic. Harris looks engaged. Biden looks lost. Looks like he’s smiling but with an expression like he’s not sure what he’s smiling about.
Biden is Trump...but with more Wars coming.:.. And if you’re looking for etiquette....please!!! Every other day is a Racist Tweet worthy of a David Duke....
Listen, Sellout Yuppie Takei. If You think Biden is the answer to anything, you’re a pathetic Clown. Biden is a Mother Fracker, a Prison Industrial Complex Master in Chief for Private Prisons, an ICE Maker, a Warmonger, and he doesn’t have a brain left.
Ok but also don’t you dare tell me to think about the bigger picture vis a vis Biden/Harris when all of these protests have been not just about police brutality, but that incarceration in this country is just the new face of slavery, and in America rn there is no bigger picture
I totally love Biden’s shirt “You won’t have to worry about my tweets when I’m President.”  They have my vote!
I fully get it. The center left picked Biden &amp; Harris so the Right can’t play the ‘socilaism &amp; defund the police’ angle against the left.  It’s gonn work, if the far left will come over and vote for a centrist law and order ticket like Biden Harris.
Today is my goal to get rid of as many fucking false democrats as I can. And by false democrats, I mean everybody who does not support Biden/Harris. Everybody else who has a weird gripe can go to hell.
Im voting for Biden but betting on Trump.
I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because his economic and environmental policies are more to my liking than Trump's but I'm not going to kid myself that either Biden or Harris care about me or my caste of society. These fucking people are delusional.
How considerate of Rs and why not spruce it up for Biden and Harris?
Sounds like you are suggesting a way to hide Biden’s cognitive challenges.
I still feel sorry for Hiden Biden. At least he can read so he must have gone to a private school! Joe Biden Reads from Script While Talking to Kamala Harris on Zoom  via
Biden got over it. It’s a good quality.
Definitely! Within MINUTES of Biden’s announcement..Trump posted his first lie-filled tweet !
I believe Biden/Harris will do more for marginalized people in one week than Trump has done in 4 years. If you want to bring about change, start on 11.4.20 after you help elect the ticket endorsed by Bernie Sanders.
Like someone said, having Trump as president is like being in a room with a 2-year old holding an automatic weapon. I’m voting for Biden/Harris because they’re adults. We can look at the fine print after we disarm Trump.
Bernie supported the NRA. For years. He voted YES for the 1994 Crime Bill. To equate Trump and Biden is ignorant, at best. As David Sedaris said, it’s like being unable to decide between a chicken sandwich and a shit and ground glass sandwich.
Well thats not entirely true, but I get the point. I honestly don't like any options they're all bad candidates, but I'd rather see a biden win than trump
What would be dumb is for anyone with even 1/2 a progressive brain to throw shade on Biden/Harris.
2 choices. Trump or Biden. What’s it going to be?
Fuck Joe Biden
Trying to deflect negative attention from Bernie while trying to smear Biden/Harris? Give it up. Bernie went the way of the buffalo. You’re helping Trump now. Knock it off.
most significant movement against police brutality and racial injustice in decades: exists  joe biden: makes a cop his vp 🤡
My Favorite part about Rumpty's Rant is his accusation that Kamala Harris was 'very disrespectful' to Joe Biden, right after he refers to Senator Warren as 'Pocahontas'! 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Joe Biden was 52 years old in 1994 so anybody that thinks he made an honest mistake is just being naive.
I figured Biden would pick Harris.  I didn't predict it would feel this good. Hopeful.
Only a combination of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton could have upstaged Trump.... Trust Trump to give her a nickname😀
Lmao Kamala???? What a joke. More Prisons, less Schools. She has a good chance of being the 1st Woman ever to be VP. So sad and pathetic...just like Rapist Biden.
She's a high dollar prostitute. Called out Biden as a racist and now joins his team.
Former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is congratulating Kamala Harris on the historic nature of being selected as Joe Biden's running mate — and offering some advice on how best to fill the role.
Calling a  Biden/Harris ticket extreme and radical is like calling wine coolers the hardest alcohol you can drink #JoeBidenForPresident2020 #Trump2020 #KamalaHarris #BidenHarris2020
Nice meme even though Biden has been on record saying he doesn’t support defunding the police. This should’ve surprised no one.
Disagree...Trump's no angel but he's not intimidated by anyone; Dems or Reps...he's arrogant and abrasive at times, but we need someone like that to fix this country. He's been true to his word on most of his promises.  Biden changes his mind with the prevailing political winds.
I got your previous comment about partisanship...bad assumption on my behalf. I wouldn't disagree with your comment about the parties. So, it's really about who is right for this country at this time...not Biden-Harris.
Biden was in office for 8 yrs as VP.  I wonder why he didn't do that...
It came out of her mouth....also said she believed Biden's accusers. I've seen Trump do more for this country in 3 yrs than I saw out of Obama in 8 yrs. I was a former Obama voter. Don't drink the Dem's kool-aid, they are liars &amp; thieves. Join the MAGA train, it's not too late.
liberals who think that racism is defined by simply things that white people do black people are the same people who think Kamala Harris is gonna save the Biden campaign in November🤡
Guaranteed, decision was made FOR Biden, not From Biden. 🙈🙊🙉🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow the left is so desperate for Trump to have the tiniest slip up mean while Biden can’t even make a full sentence
Even if Biden had the answers he still couldn’t get them correct.
In choosing Harris, Biden is embracing a former rival from the Democratic primary who is familiar with the unique rigor of a national campaign.  Story:
Yes, Harris losing to Pence would be better than Biden absolutely obliterating himself - if you, like Bill Kristol, are a progressive.
I 100% agree. She would have give Biden a chance and would have been the only hope the Dems had for a viable candidate.
You must know, You are NOT voting for Biden, you will actually be Voting for his VP, so Left agenda can be fulfilled in the destruction of the American people and Country as a whole
Democrats backing Harris and Biden proves how wishy washy they are  If it’s a cop or rapist who’s a republican it’s evil and cruel, but if it’s democrats it’s fine You know as shitty as Republicans are at least they are consistently shitty
I may be crazy but today’s revelation of Biden/Harris ticket reminds me of 2 movies: Dumb &amp; Dumber, and Liar Liar.
It’s interesting, Trump says something wrong the media has a field day with it.  Biden does it and the media doesn’t care.
Yeah I only know her from her sus DA work and from everyone clowning her so thought I’d ask. I think Biden wins with this VP pick
I had not seen Biden's profile before now
I want real change and I know we’re going to have to fight for it. Bowing down to the Biden/Harris ticket is actually sending the opposite message, one that says we’re complacent enough with the bullshit that we’ll allow it to happen for four more years.
Biden is not in control. They picked her FOR him.
Smart, tough and a great choice for Biden! I’m very glad he chose her..total class !!
SO LOOKING FORWARD TP DEBATE BETWEEN TRUMP N biden THAN THE ONE BETWEEN OUR VP N LYING kamala
Hopefully Biden can bail her out to put his name on the bus with hers now.
WOW JUST SEEN. biden AD ON TV. THREW UP IN MY MOUTH OT WAS SO FILL OF B.S.
Other things I won’t forget  is that you whored your way up in politics, kept innocent black men in jail &amp; stated you believe Biden’s multiple accusers. You have the exact same warmth as Hillary, that of a reptile. Can’t wait to see what else America finds out.
Biden should be in jail not running for president.
I personally think a vote for Biden is saying that the poor children that he took advantage of don’t matter. We’ve all seen the videos of him touching girls inappropriately with cameras rolling. Imagine what he does when there’s no cameras around. It makes me sick to my stomach.
She may or may not be a lot of things. I would hardly label her or Biden as progressives - but they aren't fascists, and they are the best choice we have right now. Not sure how there can be any debate on the matter unless one digs what's going on right getting even worse.
In my opinion you can’t be down with BLM and vote for Biden. It’s hypocrisy.
Everybody that is down with the Black Lives Matter movement but  voting for Biden, who is/was a HUGE part of the problem we’re fighting to fix, needs to do their research. Watch 13th on Netflix. Something.
I am still baffled by the the trumpers saying they are a big tent, but reject any moderates as RINOs.  They have seriously abandoned them and forced the rep mods to vote for Biden.
Joe Biden’s pick can’t be disappointing at this point because he’s such a failure himeself  Having said that it’s disappointing lol
‘Vice President Kamala Harris’ has SUCH a Beautiful sound to it!!  🤗🤗🤗  #Kamala #Kamala #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Biden  #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Any good Biden/Harris gear? Preferably where the profits go to the campaign? The Biden site just has boring stuff for now.
Nobody cares.  #Biden  #KamalaHarrisForVP  #Kamala #Kamala #BidenHarris2020
Yeah, it's Biden/Harris!
the Biden/Harris ticket IS in favor of police reform, actually. if they win, the cops will be dual-weilding
This dynamic is perplexing.  Team #MAGA is all about supporting Police, yet their strategy is to paint Biden/Harris as tough on crime?  HUH?  I'm no Democrat, but this really seems disingenuous.  (Sarcasm)  LOL
Disrespectful women!   I love them I am one.  I’m so glad Biden picked Sen Harris.  This makes my day
Lowering expectations for Trump already?  I thought it was going to be Biden Gaffe City?
I wish Biden was the monster your think he is.
Again vote for Biden if that’s what you decide, but don’t try and guilt other people who are grappling with this difficult decision, just because need to pretend you’re not voting for a shitty person
I’m not saying you shouldn’t vote for Biden, but you can’t present him as a morally/mentally superior option to Trump, because he simply is not; if you really need to vote for ‘the right person’ to make you feel like you’re doing the right thing:
Ok but for real, for a lot of people a Biden presidency and a Trump presidency are functionally equivalent; so if you’re about to make a post about how imperative it is to vote for Biden to oust Trump, just take a second and think about who in America needs help right now and who
Wow Kamala Harris as VP? Wow that’s a Top choice by Biden 👏🏻👏🏻
Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stops polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out #KamalaHarris
Biden the ultimate clout chaser 😅
I don’t know what to say other than this. Neither are my 1st choice. But we get no real progress in America  until unlimited corporate spending on elections &amp; policy issues stop polluting outcomes. That requires a Supreme Court change. That requires we get Biden in and Trump out
I hope people that want to vote for Biden do. I don’t want Trump in office either. But forcing people to vote against their best interests is not how the DNC should’ve handled things again. If Trump wins it’s bc the DNC failed to pick the right candidate to go up against Trump.
At this point almost anything is better than Trump/Pence and I'm going to try and focus on the positives of the Biden/Harris ticket, we all need to come together and get the current admin OUT. It does make me feel good to be witnessing such an important moment in history, though.
Joe Biden picks Kamala Harris as his running mate!
This is what Biden's Army will look like...
It doesn’t. Some states always vote a certain way. That’s why presidential candidates spend their time and campaign money in swing states. That’s also why you don’t see Biden ads in Alaska.
I just want normalcy again (well as much as politics had ever been). Biden is, at the very least, an actual politician so that's a come up from what we got now.
Kamala had to drop out the race because she couldn’t get the black vote what made Biden think that picking her would magically change that.
That’s nuts.  I haven’t been this happy about a VP choice since Obama chose Biden.  Honestly, I’m sure I’m MORE happy with this.  She’s incredible, and just what we need.  I can’t wait to support her for President eventually.  She’s a force of nature, exactly what we need!
No sarcasm here, btw. I support making Joe Biden into "Someone Else" as much as possible.
And also why you don’t see Biden campaign ads in Alaska. It would be a waste of campaign money.
I’ll admitit, I shed a tear or thirty when  announced  as his running mate. I haven’t been this encouraged by a political ticket in many years. I’ve been Team Kamala for Vice President since it became clear Biden would be nominated. It’s a great day! 💙🇺🇸💙
Killary......🤔 Girl stop..... We know you're going to remove Hiden Biden. So you can fulfill your dream of being a 3X  Loser again.  She knew  she would lose  and she did it anyway. #SaveTheChildren
I’m glad I live in a Republican state because I’m for sure not voting for a Biden-Harris ticket
Gee Kamala, what changed your mind?  Hypocrite!
Does this mean Jill Biden is relieved of her duties as spokesperson for the person who can’t speak for himself?
Killary/Killmala 2020 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Going to move Hiden Biden out the way. Memes gonna eat those Dems alive. Can't wait to see them.
DARK TO LIGHT NOTHING Can Stop What's Coming Clinton takes Hiden Biden place.  Welcome the Killary/Killmala Ticket
you bastards think I don’t see ur game here...take away eyes from the whole biden/kamala situation by doing a lil photograph follow-up, huh? COINCIDENCE?!?! foh I’m awake
Right!?  Who damaged the little girl who had to get bossed to school and it was all Biden’s fault. She’s a bigger liar than Biden.
I’m not surprised that Biden, the man who drafted the 1994 Crime Bill, picked this bitch as his running mate smh...
Joe Biden named Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making history by selecting the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket and acknowledging the vital role Black voters will play in his bid to defeat President Donald Trump.
Biden is a man of his word ~ Unlike our current 'president'.
Trump says: If Biden wins, we’ll have to learn to speak Chinese.  I say: It’ll be worth it.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris!!  Finally!!  Our long national nightmare is about to be OVER!!  #KamalaHarris  #Biden2020Landslide  #JoeBiden2020  #KamalaHarrisForVP
during an unprecedented backlash against mass incarceration and police brutality, the Dems are running a Biden/Harris ticket. they know we know they don't care about winning, so they're just embracing it now. it's beyond parody.
Fucc Biden
Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate  via  Yahoo!
Joe Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
You indicated Biden was intentionally racist (which he is) and supported racist and divisive policies (which he does. And so does the Democrat party).
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris need to appear on The Breakfast Club right meow!
This only shows Joe Biden is not scared of a smart aggressive woman. Kamala will Rip Mike Pence Apart. Mark my words.
Just a reminder that Biden’s VP pick, Kamala Harris, previously said that she believes Biden’s accusers. #BidenHarris2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory 🇺🇸
Cue the video of Kamala attacking &amp; destroying Biden in the primary debates. Gonna see that a lot in the next few months🙄
Listening in to an "Alaska Women for Biden" town hall when they announced Kamala Harris as the VP seems like a very appropriate place to have been. And folks were thrilled!
It's official. Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate.
I am A MESS. As soon as I heard the news that KAMALA HARRIS is officially Biden’s VP, I called my partner and we literally just screamed at each other like little girls and then hung up. Not even exaggerating.  I am so happy I get to vote for her.  #BidenHarris2020 LETS GOOOO
Lol, Biden trying to win back some of those black votes.
Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Who will Biden pick as his running mate? A poll posted too late. . .
JUST IN: Joe Biden has picked Kamala Harris as his running mate. She'll be the first African American nominated for VP by a major party.
Joe Biden has selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
Kamila Harris named as Biden’s running mate
Kamala Harris is Biden's pick! 💙🎉
Joe Biden chooses Kamala Harris as his running mate  LETS GOOOOOO!   #BuildBackBetter
Yes, good practice for when Joe Biden is on the lawn, thinking he's showing up for work
Awesome! So you are definitely voting for Biden?
This is the most annoying VP rollout ever, and I’m actually fired up about the contenders. Why is he dragging this out? Suspense doesn’t work this way, now I’m just mad lol. At this point Biden’s VP could be a tap dancing ham sandwich and I’d be like “y’all hear somethin”
The suspense is only killing the media and team trump. The rest of us know better days are ahead regardless Biden’s pick.
Susan Rice, aka how to make Trump-skeptical GOPers and people interested in sound foreign policy (not necessarily the same demographic) much, much less willing to support the Biden campaign...
Sarah Palin was a popular Governor.  She's more qualified than any of the Dem VP frontrunners  Hell, she was more qualified than Biden in 2008, who didn't understand the role the VP plays in the Legislative branch *as a sitting senator*
Thankfully, disgruntled Bernie fans such as yourself WILL be FAR out-numbered at the polls.  Joe Biden WILL be our next awesome President of the United States of America! 🤗🤗  Go Joe!!  #Biden2020  #JoeBiden #Biden2020 #JoeBiden2020 #Biden2020ToSaveAmerica
As someone who was raped and lost their home because of Scientology, I will hunger strike outside  home if Karen is Biden's VP pick until he picks someone else.  Scientology is a cult and a scam- it is NOT a "harmless" religion. 😡  Don't be apathetic and complicit!💔
NO.  Karen Bass is disqualified to be Joe Biden's VP nominee because she praised and promoted the propaganda that  is a religion, when Scientology is in fact a cult guilty of rape, blackmail and murder.   Karen Bass should resign!   #DefundScientology #KarenBassRESIGN
My general view of this is that Biden has like a rock-solid base, locked in by Trump's awfulness. We're not going to see the race tighten beyond a certain point.
I suspect that this is about as tight as the race will get, and Biden has some running room as Trump continues to bungle things.
did anyone look at Michelle Obama's wiki page? I tried but I don't know how to look up edits, it was edited yesterday. I know she's just listed as a speaker at the DNC but the first thing that popped in my head was  "Biden/Obama 2020"
Totally gonna vote Biden even though he is NOT my man at all! AND you are not alone. Many have been down this trail and survived for decades💕💕you can do it!
"As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay — and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world."
On the left is Greater St James &amp; Little St James. They both belong to Jeffery Epstien. Little St James was pedophile island. On the right is Water Island, Joe Biden &amp; Biden family own it. If you don't believe me research it yourself. I do  mean this as a political point.

Weird, I see him on a bike and campaigning at events while the GOP photoshops his images, lying to Americans that he’s in his basement. #GOPLiesToAmerica

It’s finally happened. I had a dream last night that Harris was announced as Biden’s VP
Sorry ass having the lack of any supplies is all on Obama and Biden they sold our factories to China and Obama didn’t have any stock piles the only thing he stockpiled was the Koran he stockpiled us the American citizens in the war in the Middle East to break our military down
Oh, you think me posting this is my way of advocating for Biden? Hilarious.
Nobody actually thinks Biden is socialist, nor has his centerist politics in the last 40 years suggested as much. In fact, Biden is more conservative than Trump.  Biden has spent a career opposing Russia while Trump licks Putin’s boots and Putin pays bounties on our troops.
Open my recent searches and who do I find? Joe Biden. I have never searched for Biden, and all my previous searches are gone. You suck
No.  Biden only wrote the bill that has lead hundreds of thousands to be incarcerated.  That's all.
President Donald Trump has never said that..... but you Joe Biden have said it... but you probably don’t remember!!
Add it to the Presidential debate. I’d love to hear Trump and Biden’s platform on the female orgasm.😂
Biden is going to ask us for 6 weeks of lockdown in exchange for the $ help we need and to be as united as we can be for the duration to save lives.
I’m generally an optimist, but unless Biden wins and a whole lot of these crooks do serious jail time, 2021 will make 2020 seem good.
tRUMP doesn't represent All Americans. His Administration openly admits that $$ will flow to 'Red' states and neglect 'Blue' States.  Joe Biden won't divide America by Red and Blue.
When Biden chooses Whitmer you will look stupid for making fun of him
Yes! Joe Biden and his Vice Presidential candidate are ready to Lead Americans in a National Pandemic Response Plan and a way OUT of this COVID crisis created by  and
I cannot shake the impression that Pelosi, Biden, and Nadler are just actors in some demonic theatre.  Blackmail? Extreme cognitive dissonance? Anti-peace nihilism?
As noted previously, there won’t be a national testing strategy before Jan. 21st, and THEN only if we elect Joe Biden. So,  I’d rather see you tweeting about electing Biden than wasting time tweeting about Trump’s FAILURES. Get out the VOTE!
Quick send Joe Biden to defend the USPS!
What?  Beijing Biden is changing the narrative...again? Or did you simply forget the script?  Obviously, these words are in response to OUR Presidents comments this afternoon.
NO.   Fck Karen Bass for praising and defending the cult of Scientology. If Joe Biden picks Karen Bass, I WILL go on a hunger strike outside his home in Delaware until he picks someone else!
such a deep bench of talent, the best you could come up with was Biden
We have an #IdiotInChief  Yet  jabs at Biden's verbal gaffs!
Dues Biden even know how to tell the truth? He lies like it's second nature!
And people talk about Biden. 🤣🤣🤣
I can promise you that Biden knows when the NINETEEN EIGHTEEN Spanish Flu happened and when one of the two biggest wars happened/ended.   This guy was it for some of you? THIS guy? Seriously. This is getting ridiculous.
"Now, Alaskan culture, traditions, and jobs are on the line. As President, I will do what President Trump has failed to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay — and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world."
Robin Williams on Joe Biden...
Stop with the Joe Biden has to pick a woman of color. Some of y’all didn’t vote for the white email lady. Hush!
"Bristol Bay has been foundational to the way of life of Alaska Natives for countless generations, provides incredible joy for recreational anglers from across the country, and is an economic powerhouse [...] It is no place for a mine."
I will vote for Biden and nothing will change my mind ❤️
New Standards for Tailings Storage; Biden vows to sidestep law on permitting.
Biden is so full of it. They don’t care about Alaska. They are just talking to get Alaskans to vote for him.
There is nothing prominent about any of these “men”. Since when do “prominent” men determine the outcome or decide an election? They are power broking manipulators and are not America First. No matter who Biden picks, he will be trounced by #Trump2020 #WWG1WGAWORLDWIDE
Joe Hiden Biden would close Alaska to any and all resource development except for Seattle fishing businesses. Alaska's economy would be decimated. #alaska #ResourceBasedEconomy
Joe Biden would shut Alaska down. You think the Chinese Flu is bad. TAPS would be shut down, no mining, no coal, nothing but Seattle fishing. Joe Biden would #flattenalaska
Iowa rocks! Where's Hiden Biden?
Biden won't spend this much time Primping... Let alone have a Professional do MAKEUP! 🤣😂 It's past time for Americans to have a Real President, not a poor Actor.
Exactly!  Yet many have voted already for Biden, without knowing who they are voting for as his running mate....pure lunacy!  We must ensure that President Trump wins 4 more years!
Spot On, Cheri!  Biden has gained his wealth after being in office.  Amen, the dems are morally, and intellectually bankrupt!
My vote is for Biden! I trust him to pick the person he will work the best with. Those not chosen will be used to fill some very critical positions in his administration. ❤️
So you’re voting for Biden then. Awesome!
DT is NOT republican, or aligned with any party other than himself. Trumpies are willing to avoid Biden and cling to this psycho in the name of what?? I still don’t get it. Their other option is Kayne 😂🤭
Why do people keep saying Susan Rice? I'm sorry but that would be the most boring ticket since Gore/Lieberman. Biden isn't a dynamic candidate. He needs to pick someone to get people excited about.  That would be Harris or Warren.
Vote for Biden!🙏🙏🙏
Biden does have alzheimer’s and you need to watch a different channel trump has done more for the Americans then any other president your just used to being lied to to get your vote then they do nothing that they said  a vote for Biden is death to us
There’s people out there that are really going to vote for Joe Biden😂
Jill Biden could run for VP as a woman of color, I'm sure she's dyes her hair regularly enough.
And suddenly media is real concerned about how progressive Biden.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Sunday that if he’s elected, his administration would stop a proposed copper and gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region.
A vote for Biden means there won't be freedom for any future generations. Vote TRUMP 2020!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸
Been saying this since last year. I love me some Kamala. I’m fine either way. ⁦  “The vice presidency is not the job she should go for — asking to be considered as attorney general in a Biden administration would be more like it.”
China Biden collusion
Biden could reasonably win by 10 points even
It’s 68% minority. It’s voting for Biden
i'm a bit underwhelm with Biden yet i would rather have him than 4 more years of gop
Notice how SOME from the news media are trying to get SOME democrats to reveal Biden's VP choice...before he's ready to announce? Stop...just stop.
79% Americans said that they would vote for President Trump instead of Biden and this still is not the silent majority
Shut everything down, give everyone Basic Income monthly checks, ramp up testing, keep schools closed, etc. UNTIL a vaccine is developed and enough PPE is provided to everyone who needs them to stay safe on the front lines of this out of control pandemic.  In the words of Biden-
At this point, it’s pretty easy I figure. I can’t stomach Biden. He’s a Reagan republican light, but I’d crawl over broken glass to fight anyone who tried to keep me from voting for him right now.
I'm meta-predicting that if 538 comes out with a model in the next week, it puts Biden's "nowcast" odds at 95%, and election-day odds around 75%.
Biden approval? ROTFLMFAO He will be dead before it’s ever approved.
That’s Right that’s about all Joe Biden knows how to do is ride a bike because he can’t think he can’t speak I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know where he’s at even riding his bike that’s why he’s got a follow so many people while doing it
Donald Trump is got leather soled shoes on on a steel incline and Biden his mind is gone for good vote read vote trump he’s our Countries only hope
She’s panicking because less than 3 months until the election, Trump did the unexpected with his new EOs yesterday that made him look like a leader once again, and Biden’s numbers are slipping fast. Trump has the upper hand now and Pelosi knows it. 😁
You’re the Sucker if you’re voting for Joe Biden....
Joe Biden says he’ll work to stop Pebble Mine if he wins presidency
Too late- we need to impeach and remove Trump immediately. Joe Biden can easily defeat Mike Pence in November. Trump needs to GO NOW.
I’m riding with Biden no matter what they come up with because it’s a lie.
Biden’s appointees will at least be competent, unlike trump’s “best people”.
i thought there were FOUR Horsemen of the Apocalypse? oh yeah, Biden is number 4!
This is an article explaining why Karen Bass and her affiliation with Scientology would be disastrous for Joe Biden- and why NO ONE who praises this sadistic scamming cult should ever be in government (certainly not the White House).👇 #DefundScientology
U.S. Intelligence Says Republicans Are Working With Russia to Reelect Trump
What's the Catholic Church say about abortion compared to Joe Biden?  Seems to be in conflict for a devout Catholic.... just saying... 🤔
President Trump.  Please tell the people clearly that the goal of Mail in voting it to have issues (any issues work) that cause counts to be indeterminable.  That’s why no one cares about Biden, or even you winning.  The plan is Pelosi given vote count impossible.
Of course not.  The goal of mail in voting is to have issues that cause the count to be “indeterminable”.  That’s why no one cares about Biden, not hearing much about the election.  If a count cannot be resolved, Pelosi becomes President.  ANY counting problem works.
Shut up Racist!  Whoever supports Biden is a loathsome Racist!
there’s something to be said about nobody really knowing what a Joe Biden sounds like pre 2020 and now everyone knows EXACTLY what his old dying brain sounds like and he might be PRESIDENT. dumb country
The Russian government is actively seeking to undermine Joe Biden's campaign in order to help Donald Trump win reelection. Sound familiar?
That will be a fun thing for Biden to deal with in his first couple of months in office
that's all ya got joe? "Hidin' Joe, Biden', aka 'bunker Biden'...only have attack dog politics, weaponizing the deaths of thousands, using covid19 2 justify hiding. u know your brain cant handle a debate. u r sick, joe. go home to your family, joe.
Hope everyone is prepared for an “indeterminable” outcome of the election.  Neither Biden or Trump will be President because of irregularities that will not be able to be resolved.  This is why there’s no need for Biden to face voters.  Prepare for Pelosi as President.
Wonder if he is waiting for Obamagate indictments, cat and mouse between Trump and “Biden”.
Just look a Biden’s history. His actions speak volumes about his policies..  His support of the crime bill resulted in the incarceration of a lot of people of color.  His support of the patriot act lead to the militarization of our police. But hey🤷‍♂️
To be honest, most people considering voting for her weren’t voting for Biden anyway.
The fact that Biden is a cyclist (like me!) makes me like him so much more
So you don’t like what you have been doing to trump but are mad because your loser Biden got all that he had coming poor baby’s lie in your bed and you have to lay in your bed
One is pancreatic cancer, the other is brain cancer.. Both ore terrible..  Look at Biden’s record.  His history cannot be ignored.
China wants me to vote for Biden.  Russia wants me to vote for Trump. I want $20million. DM me. Serious bidders only.
Basically if Biden wins it’s simply because more people disliked Trump. We’re also voting for whoever Biden’s running mate is because there is no way he’s getting through a 4 year term with his mental state the way it is.
Y’all think they support Biden?
trump actually takes them serious as a threat. biden is too dead to be a threat to them
Joe Biden is gonna totally #JoeBiden this #VicePresident pick.
Agree.  The plan is for neither Trump or Biden to be President.  Mail in voting is key and Pelosi will be President to an unresolvable count.  They don’t care what the issues are, just as long as there are lots of them.
Russia Working to Damage Biden's White House Bid, Spy Agencies Say
Understandable. Just look at how the press is covering for Biden.
If Biden, nobody
Thank you President Joe Biden for NOT referring to that traitor as "President"- Putin's sockpuppet doesn't deserve that title. Donald Trump should be called BunkerBoy, if anything.  Joe Biden is our President now.🗽🌊
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday rejected congressional subpoenas issued for him and for the State Department to provide information and testimony to lawmakers about two politically charged developments.
Wow! Joy Reid heard it come out of Joe Biden's mouth 13 times.
pennsylvania biden president. cant you read
Hillary Clinton, because Biden does the wrong thing by nature. Its his default.
Nichols is just another DS liberal covering for Joe Biden as usual! He’s a joke! Another progressive POS!
Thank you!  Who in their right mind would vote for Beijing Biden and Marxism.....just saying....
Soooo....does that mean Joe Biden is a demigod? Like in the movie "Clash of the Titans "
They keep having to remind Biden that he’s not running for the Senate Seat in South Carolina. 🤣  Once he figures that out, they will inform him what VP they have selected for him.
‘I didn’t mean to say that all Black People are the same.  It just naturally came out that way.’-Joe Biden
To make matters even more confusing, there are Scientologists pretending to be old fashioned Democrats and make a big show of publically supporting Joe Biden- but they're really trying to lure naive victims into their trap to gain trust- to get blackmail they can use against you.
If  picks Karen Bass for VP, I WILL go to Delaware and hunger strike outside his home until he kicks someone else!✊  The People don't need a Scientology apologist in the White House. I will starve to death outside of Joe Biden's home if he picks her.  #DefundScientology

NO.👎  Karen Bass is disqualified to be Joe Biden's VP nominee because she praised and promoted the propaganda that  is a religion, when Scientology is in fact a cult guilty of rape, blackmail and murder.   Karen Bass should resign immediately!   #DefundScientology✊

god  biden when he got hurted
How would you explain a non-racist being pro-segregation, like Biden was?
All of that is under the Blood. You obviously know nothing of the Lord Jesus who forgives all of our iniquity and cleans the slate when we receive Him. His sins are under the Blood! Are yours? He has plenty of fruit to show for his repentance. Biden meanwhile still lives the lie!
Is this the future you want? Then vote for Hiden Biden. Just despicable. #flattenantifa #alaska #riots2020
Yeah that’s pretty bad but he -said- that, Biden -did- sniff and touch those kids....
Oh I agree fully. I intend on voting for biden but ugh I hope he picks someone for AG that has intent to go after him and not let him off the hook.
What's Biden going to do to hurt God? Nuke heaven?
My question is the same one I have for all those who say Biden is a Christian? How do you know? Where is the fruit of that?
Biden’s dumb ass remarks about prosecuting trump is exactly why Bernie should have the nomination but I do like that he said that he wouldn’t interfere if they do. The issue is we have a repeat of Nixon and his dirty tricks. They’ll make excuses to let trump off as good for
Biden on the path of Marxism TRUMP on the path of Liberty! # #WWG1WGA
