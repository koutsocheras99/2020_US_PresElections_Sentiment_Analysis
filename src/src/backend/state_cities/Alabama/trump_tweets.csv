Why is there a JOE BIDEN, NANCY PELOSI, CHUCK SCHUMER? Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden!!!! Now Schumer is flipping the ideology against Trump as starting it on religion.
Biden started it about Christians before Trump brought attention to Biden, but  did MSNBC know about the Christian murders in Africa before MSNBC published the #FakeNews about you!!!!! Hundreds of Christians Murdered by Islamic Jihadists Across 3 African Countries!
Mark Zuckerberg is no expert and has no degrees in either medicine nor a practitioner of the White House, not employed by the Federal Government nor President Trump, in fact Mark is a flunky that has not one COVID-19 brain cell of a cure.
It is what it is trump, and you don't give a dam
It was in their best interest to get a deal. Now you just hand a win to Trump.
What can we do? Trump and his butt plugs are operating on the “kitchen sink,” strategy they are willing to do anything and everything in to win by any means necessary. The repugnant party is complicit in their silence and behind the scenes actions. We cannot not survive 4more yes
IMO, Trump is horrible for Whites. MAGA doesn't consider him an ally. They are not paying attention to him. Also, it is mainstream conservatism that has marginalized him. Empowering conservatives just means more tax cuts and wars
Trump is Putin's patsy
Joey Fingers to minorities: Let me speak, think and do for you because you're not able to do for yourselves.  Donald J. Trump to minorities: I won't tell you just what you want to hear. I can show you better than I can tell you.  Which one is the ONLY choice in 2020?   TRUMP!

trump and his enablers being really transparent about their anti-democratic strategy to stay in power.   I really hope American media at all levels can clearly see and say what's going on.
Without a new law passed before Nov, PA doesn't allow (likely Dem-leaning) absentee ballot to be tallied until polls fully close on EDay.    Which makes this tweet by trump ominous to say the least:
Lol bro being anti Biden isn't being pro Trump.  This was fun though, take care
trump's strategy in PA: -Polarize absentee voting so GOP voters go in-person. -Litigate the end of ballot drop boxes so Dem voters who vote absentee are forced to use USPS.  -Corrupt USPS so ballots don't arrive by EDay.
Republicans were never going to agree to the Democrats stimulus plan or even negotiate with them. They were always going to shoot it down so Trump can do what he wants through executive order and call himself the hero.
Democrats want to give Americans $600 a week to help them through the pandemic.   Trump and his Republicans do not.   That’s all this is. Everything else is smoke and mirrors.
Just be honest Joey, and say “because I hate Trump”, because we all know you do.
If people had listened to Trump in March, instead of shutdown the information that HCQ was a game changer. Many people who are now lost forever, would be walking around living life. Willful ignorance = negligent homicide.
Trump wants the glory of issuing Executive Orders (which may/not provide any real relief) for re-election purposes.

Actually, you are describing, unfortunately, a great bit of HIS SUPPORTERS and it’s pathetic! You are a colossal A$$, who needs to apologize for saying something so asinine. Mr. Trump pays his way into everything; who’s suppose to be impressed by that?

Latino's vs African American's according to Joe are of different values while Black's strive for change in America more than Latino's that are willing to accept the values in America except those of Black's. Joe knows for certain neither are the same. Biden is worse than Trump.
It will be the black vote this election that carries Trump.  Typically the GOP candidate gets 8-10% of black votes.  This election Trump will get more than 20%
Corona virus didn’t have to be this serious. If Trump would’ve just protected his country we’d be good right now. I just be blowed away by the way shit is when I think about it.

Since I live in the world of reality I do believe polls. I do believe in science. Trump medicine will get you killed. I do believe that journalist and newspapers that tell the horrible truth about the anti Christ in the Oval, love truth and don’t just hate Trump.
Here’s a little truth for you: Trump is a traitor. NOT ONE WORD ABOUT OUR SOLDIERS’ deaths paid for by Putin. There must be some really sleazy and foul pictures of that lying coward in a Moscow hotel room or else he owes the oligarchs tens of millions funneled by DeutscheBank!
Truth ain’t biased. Ugly sometimes, infuriating  sometimes but never comes from the mouth of Trump.... oops  almost forgot he did admit the other day people don’t like him as much as Fauci and Birk.
You haven’t watched Trump’s latest briefings and interviews have you? The man is devolving right before our eyes. The ignorance, mendacity, pathological racism/ sexism, narcissism are giving way to  obvious mental illness! Do you really think he wants Biden, Swann are him alive!

That dog of yours  is a better judge of character than you are if you’re still supporting the Traitor in the Oval. How many  US troops died at his Boss Putin’s behest and Trump has said not one word! Yet he demeans John Lewis. Commander Bones Spurs is a buffoon and dangerous!
My vote for Trump was quick and satisfying!!

I have noticed that the air from a mask gets pushed into your eyes. Have they ruled out the eyes as an infection source? The masks are also a source of moisture around the nose and mouth. Masks don't filter out the virus so why is this better than clean and dry? Just wondering.
When Tommy Tuberville says he'll "always have Pres. Trump's back," you better believe him.
Is this the behavior of someone who is "morally superior" to Trump? Especially asking my "conservative" friends who can't bring themselves to vote for Trump and say Biden is so "decent." Disgusting. He will say and do anything to become President (including sell out to far left).

After the last four years? After the last few months? No, I cannot. We've lost far more ground under Trump in 4 years than Obama in 8 years. Voting to lose ground and empower the GOP to push its anti-white agenda is ratifying our own marginalization

I'll vote green. I live in Alabama, a solidly red state that will go for Trump by a 25 point margin regardless. I would urge folks who live in solidly red or blue states to vote green. If greens get to 10%, they get automatic ballot access &amp; in the debates. That's a game changer.
It is deeply irresponsible of Trump and the GOP to repeatedly try to undermine &amp; create public distrust in Dr Fauci, the top infectious disease expert. It’s also just wrong. Period. Hard stop  *Fixed it for you

New Disclosures Confirm: Trump Himself Was Target of Obama Administration’s Russia Probe | National Review
I don’t think he’s being indecisive.  He’s doing what every presidential nominee should do:  vet and choose carefully.  This is something that Donald Trump has NEVER done.
This is my view of Democrats. They were always nutty, but Trump pushed them off their ledge. Now they are total loons.
Dr. Fauci fooled a lot of ppl. They planned the 💩 out well. Dr. Fauci SEEMED to have been against tRump in the beginning, but it was an optic illusion. He was to gain the trust of the ppl. That lady in that video warned us about him. DR. FAUCI IS NOW SAYING THAT THEY ARE GOING
Exactly. And the Trump dictatorship is so extreme that criminals like Comey, Clinton and Brennan have not been arrested and charged. And a Democrat judge will not dismiss charges against general Flynn after the prosecutors admitted that the FBI framed him.
I will vote for Donald Trump without reservation. He has been a breath of fresh air in corrupt Washington. If the Democrats are so wonderful how have Pelosi, Schumer and Biden have been there 40-50 years and the problems are all Trump’s fault..

Just think: Mail-In madness will keep  in office indefinitely!   we LOVE that idea!!! A fed election would take at least a year to sort out if ever. You’d be handing Trump a second term by default. Keep up the good work.
Sure Trump...sure.  Just like 15 cases will soon be zero...
Democrats believe that closing churches and Trump rallies will help them in November. They only plan to allow riots protests and political funerals. They must think Americans are really stupid.

I lost my brother today. He was spewing nonsense straight from Trump’s mouth and I challenged him on it. He hung up in a rage. I was the only member of the family speaking to him.
Hell, we need him for many more terms but, I'll settle for the four years! I'm not going to be picky. We got Ted Cruz, Don, Jr., Eric Trump and Mike Pence waiting in the wings!
If Trump comes up with a lot of asinine rules, he probably will be ignored by the outlet. Plus Biden won't bother debating with him. Which will hurt Trump more, given today's polling.
I understand but the stuff they say incites far right groups to action. Remember how Trump rallied his followers to act on the governor in Michigan? That was dangerous, what the man motivated to send pipe bomb to his enemies? Free speech has limits
Trump and all his cronies should be afraid.
I laughed out loud when Trump tried to explain that Russia used to be called the Soviet Union, but now it’s just Russia to someone who obviously knows more than he does. #TrumpIsDumb

I'm no fan of Trump. My hubby &amp; I are retired on Soc Sec. Biden has vowed to cut it his entire career. Trump has been in office 4 years. He could have cut it but didn't. Who should I vote for? The man who wants to cut it or the man who could have cut it but didn't? Vote Green.
I'm on social security. My husband is also. We've both paid in for decades and we're finally reaping our benefits. Biden has vowed to cut it his entire career.  Trump, however, has had 4 years to cut it and didn't do it. Something to think about.
Really dude? Just say that YOU don’t want her! Everyone you named, STILL needs our support and votes! You sir, are not helping. I’m sure Trump can use a campaign manager, seems that you are vying for the position. How can ppl despise someone they DON’T KNOW?
Make it happen Trump ‼️‼️‼️
Because we don't know what we don't know, we have to base our decisions on those who are both in the know, and have our best interests at heart. The only person I know that fits that bill is Donald J Trump.
Twitter needs to block Trump, Hannity, Porrio, Ingram for all the hate and misinformation they spew
and Mr. Trump STILL discussing dead TRAITORS, but NO mention of Russia $$ for dead bodies of US soldiers! Inhofe needs to RESIGN and if  is a part of this, he should step down too. And as always, IT’S A GOOD DAY 4  TO RESIGN
The fact that he could say that is proof he needs to be off the air. Trump has been married 3 times had an affair on all 3 wives including his present one. Told 20,000 lies, paid off a porn star and mistress asked a country to investigate his rival but Obama is sleazy.
How did you draw that conclusion? No, that’s not what I am saying, HOWEVER, they need to FEEL like they lost our demographic, because w/ SOME, it’s the ONLY way they appreciate what they have. My conscience wouldn’t allow me 2 do NOTHING, re getting Trump out
Exactly, Democrats need to stop encouraging this step-aside garbage and maybe think things through for once. Pence would be a formidable candidate and I think has been the de facto president for much of the Trump administration.
Actually we should probably alter the character of this nation permanently.    Not saying Trump's the guy to do it but the character of this nation probably can't get any worse...

Yeah, that's a problem.  We need to remember that God is sovereign regardless of the level of godlessness in the world or coming from Washington.  Neither Biden nor Trump has it within them to unseat God from His throne.  #Christian

The same people complaining about Trump wanting to ban TikTok were the same ones who wanted to boycott it because "it was racist".
Well I believe that more than whether or not trump knew Epstein was a perv.
Yes, whoever it is. I don't care if he names one of the Ninja Turtles. I just want Trump out of the White House. This election is not about anything but saving our country, our Democracy and restoring some decency to the Presidency. Nothing else. The world is laughing at us.

If you have to ask is Trump a fascist after seeing a tweet like today's, calling to delay the election....I don’t understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can’t believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.
Wouldn’t it be amazing if trump tweeted “please don’t believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they’re spreading false information on social media.”  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don’t want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don’t vote for him even if you can’t stand his opponent.
I have not heard this term but like it. “one-thingism.” I have referred to many evangelicals having a one trick pony mindset when supporting Trump just because he says he's against abortion and will pack the judicial system with conservative judges. They overlook his many ills.

You could convince a stump it is wrong sooner than you could convince Trump he is wrong. We may survive a few more months with him but not 4 1/2 years.
But it has morphed into the Trump virus because of his denials.
OMG... you guys have really lost all touch with reality. Like the virus, we really don't care.  Trump is such a danger to our country, none of that matters!

Seriously? So we don't have a President Trump, or had a President Clinton or a President Jefferson?
To Trump, this has nothing to do with national security. He is still mad TIkTok was used to sabotage his rally and he has to get even with any perceived enemy.
i wonder if trump knows that taking away the one app gen z praises will not get him votes.
Trump can't ban and stop everything and everyone he dislikes,he can't do many things he's claimed he will do or can,Trump is a liar...PERIOD!
I love the way Kamala baits Trump by tagging him in her tweets. She did it 24 hours ago too. 😂😂🤣 She’s ramping up the energy on his ass and he has yet to mention her.
this is what trump shills actually believe
The media is adamantly trying to argue that Trump may question the election results and not leave office. What they should be covering is the reaction of BLM and Antifa rioters when he wins. I honestly wonder how our cities will deal with that. But alas, journalists are silent.
Even I know how to make a sandwich and I uploaded my TV app on Google play store world news and thinking about trying Trump cutie funding for post office so that snail mail to get lost and mail  voting and the protests people say you took our jobs you can't kick them street side
So when trump isn’t in office anymore does that mean we can start buying Chick Fil A again 👀
Thank God for Q, Trump, &amp; The Plan!! #GreatAwakeningWorldwide

The co-founder of the Federalist society is calling for Trump's removal from office.   What a time to be alive.
Trump, you know what to do with yourself that me and millions of Americans wish you have the courage to do. You don’t have a Constitutional authority to cancel any DAMN election you fascist fat fuck. We will vote your ass out of office and then we will prosecute your ass in 2021.
I don’t understand the “silent majority” for Trump   1. It’s not a majority, 3,000,000 more people voted for HRC, and he’s clearly lost more supporters than he’s gained in 4 yrs  2. Is it supposed to be a positive thing that many of your supporters won’t admit they vote for you?
It was instant.. thanks trump!
I sure hope so, she is by far the best qualified. Trump will try to waponize her appearances on TV after Benghazi but I don’t think that will matter to anyone except his base.
thanks trump !
Agreed, but I will wait in line, no matter how long it takes, to vote against Trump.
Why isn’t this getting more media attention ? GOP Senate throwing a fit over $600 for people unemployed bc of Covid, but no issue tossing 1.7 billion towards helping trump line his own pockets...smh

Trump is taken away the protection for prep-condition.   When he wins that his orders is cancelled too.    So he has lied again for his party and country. Trump offers no protection from the health insurance,  we all have prep-condition now because of the virus.

You think your sick now--Just wait if Biden should become President.  No country has ever survived socialism; they all fail miserably.  Lousy everything goes if Biden is elected.  It's down to good vs evil, so take your pick.  Trump did not cause this virus and responded well.
You have officially lost it.  Trump lives rent-free in your head.  You are a great singer but you are way over the top with your hate.
Finding it hard to believe that Trump's MAGA supporters are not being negatively affected by the GOP stonewalling on COVID-19 aid package. More public awareness is needed to show that ALL of the problems we face came about on the GOP's WATCH!
Thinking that the source of this treatment is Trump's MAGA supporters who take his criticism of any public official as a 'go' ticket to do harm or even more pain! Cohen described it as Trump code, and there are many, many MAGAs out there to do Trump's bidding! For free!

So, Russia doesn't want Biden to win and China doesn't want Trump to win, according to ODNI.  Actually, that definitely makes sense. Biden would be more polite to China which they want for business/superpowering  and Russia wants Trump for business/foreign indifference. 1/2
Democrats don't let them get away with this plot for Trump to SAVE AMERICANS! That's all   trying to do. Deny   any credit for helping Americans &amp; prop up Trump's campaign by allowing his Execitive Order to save the day!

Trump supporter on the TL
I don't care if Trump went to Wharton or any other institute of learning. The dude's understanding and use of the English language is on a 3rd grade level at absolute *best*.  And no, him being a well traveled con man doesn't make him smart at all. It makes him cold, and lucky.
Must be a Bernie Bro who doesn't realize that Biden has already apologized and clarified his statement from yesterday! One hell of a lot more than your favorite, Trump, is even capable of doing! "Killing God?" "Killing the Bible?" Don't hear an apology from DJT for saying that!
Obama was cool and all but I wouldn't say I'm on """Team Obama""".  I'm more on Team Get Trump Out of Office as soon as Humanly Possible omg Why won't he just resign 85ish days is too damn long oh wait he's president until January 20th God help us all.  Too long a name?
If Biden, a proven multi-liar, chooses Rice, another multi-liar, the Trump campaign will be in nirvana..... I say this as a NeverTrumper.
Man, the Bernie Bros and Russian bots are out in force today! They must be bored as Trump hasn't done anything stupid enough today to blame on Biden! (But it's only 1:30 PM CDT!)

Trump's payroll tax proposal is a bad idea and probably illegal
Is this a new campaign hat authorized by Trump himself? Based on what he and the GOP have done to our country over the past eight months, it's a perfect fit! When does it go on sale? His MAGAs and evangelical supporters will buy them up fastly!
And Trump thought Thailand was pronounced Thighland! Your point?
Careful "taking the bait" responding to Trump criticism. Your clarification was good and needed but you can't respond everytime Trump raises his ugly head out of Putin's ass or Fox News.
It would certainly seem like that! He's tried to start other culture wars, so what would be different than a religious war? After all, he has the evangelicals led by F. Graham and Jerry Falwell, Jr. as his top generals, the latter who can't keep his pants zipped just like Trump!
Not sure what your point of view is, but the COVID-19 has been here since January and the GOP knew it was here but did nothing. Sens. Burr &amp; Loeffler sold of stocks at a profit in February! They knew, but did nothing! Do you want 4 more years of misery under Trump? Seems so!

Right, and you said BLM in front of Trump tower is hate speech. You are a rasict and Joe is a good man. Period....
Isn't this, by definition an oxymoron? (Referring to Trump of course, NOT biden!)
If Biden had that kind of power, Trump would be in a straight jacket encased in a padded cell that uses barb wire as its wall! His 'meals' would be MacD' and KFC washed down with hydoxyclean in liquid form! But, alas, Biden wouldn't use his power in this manner! He's a nice guy!
That state will be very close no question. Obviously, I think it will be much smaller than his 9 point win (smaller than McCain and Romney who won by double digits in 2008 and 2012). Between OH, IA, TX, GA and NC, I think Trump’s weakest one is NC which could really flip.
Good point about convention bounces. If anything is to be determined from this, there will be some tightening but in the end, Trump will lose (EVEN in the press-revered Electoral College).

Excellent point by Team Biden in yesterday’s email about how beating Trump will not be easy. Despite the pandemic, CNN’s constant pressure (as I can imagine) on Trump/GOP handling of it, and other atrocities/corruption, his minions and the GOP will fight hard.

Kayne West is looking to replace Pence on Trump's ticket! Not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing! But will Kayne's wife Kim stoop so low as to take up residence in The Blair House? Would Kayne release their taxes? So many questions with no answers!
How does one become a 'pragmatic problem solver' when the same person is the problem? McSally is one of Trump's GOP and that is one of the largest problems that the true republicans, and the rest of us, face on November 3, 2020.
We will not be fooled by this trump operative
This should be a non story. He doesn't have time to get ballot access and unless his poll numbers are through the roof he will never get near a debate stage. This isn't about Biden or Trump, its a means to silence 3rd party candidates.

I do not think NY ♥️ TRUMP. SDNY MANHATTAN STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL TAX AND FINANCE  NY 🖕 TRUMP
Gotta agree
Free speech has limits. You can't scream "Fire" in a movie theater, for instance if there isn't one. The inaccurate information that Trump is giving to folks, is essentially doing the same thing. By telling people kids are basically immune to this virus, puts us all at risk.
At the mall once i heard a mother tell her son, "Things cost money. You can thank Donald Trump for that."
As is the moral character, the ethics, and the felony status of the people Trump has surrounded himself with. You, Jason Miller, should just slither back under your rock, never to be heard from again. You have until credibility

President Trump is still trying to overturn “Obamacare,” but his predecessor’s health care law keeps gaining ground in places where it was once unwelcome.
What anarchy has Trump been a part of it looks to me like that honor belongs to the democrats?
The massive amounts of wilful ignorance and wilful stupidity combined with the blatant disregard for facts, for fucking *reality* itself is why I quit the Republican party. It starts with Trump and then trickles down to other leaders, and ultimately Republican voters.  It's sad.
&gt;Trump tweets and posts on Facebook a misleading video about kids and covid &gt;Removed, as it should have been &gt;Conservatives are crying election interference You have to make an effort to be *this* stupid.  Facebook and Twitter absolutely did the right thing.

trump supporters are literally delusional.
The Democratic establishment believe it will hurt Trump.
I find it hard to believe this is not going to be another gotcha moment for Trump.  He sets this stuff up to appear weak and then it all blows up in their faces.  Who knows?  His base is not having any of it and they’re ready to fight.
He has a pretty clear cut platform. Having said that, even if he didn’t have one it would still be better than the Democrats platform of “Anyone but Trump.” They’d nominate the Devil with a pedophile as his running mate so long as it’s not Trump. That’s beyond sad and immature
President Trump WE the people, over 45 million of us, need your help. PLEASE go around the babies in Congress that refuse to bend, and make an executive order to extend the Unemployment and protection against eviction. Clearly Congress doesn’t care but we KNOW YOU care!!!

I don’t believe Trump is innocent &amp; here to save us. I think he’s manipulating the masses w/ a misinformation campaign, cloaked in a virtuous cause. He’s a sexual predator &amp; a pedo. Just like the adoption agencies were cover for the trafficking, Trump’s CYA is being POTUS.
tonight while walking through midtown I noticed that a Alabama flag flying house with Doug Jones signs was directly across the street from an Auburn flag flying house with Trump signs and I could just feel the tension

WOW! We are fighting our own president to preserve our American rights &amp; democracy. Don’t take your vote for granted. We might not have it much longer if this Trump regime stays in power.   Rest In Power while we keep stirring up Good Trouble.

I am a #LincolnVoter . Campaigned for W, voted straight ticket till '16. I couldn't stand Trump for the way he treated women, the disabled, and POC. And the nationalism. It isn't an American dream if we exclude everyone. It's a nightmare. I'll be voting Biden &amp; blue.
I think Kanye West is running for President so he can "split the vote" between Trump &amp; Biden. And why did Kanye West take the $5,000,000 PPE loan from Trump? People please don't fall for this! #KanyeWest #Kanye2020 #TrumpThreatensAmerica #Trump #MSNBC #Democrats #WednesdayWisdom
My guess is that it’s not alleging anything. Rather, whenever Trump &amp; Company is accused of anything bad, the first response is always “but _____ did it too/worse”, so this is probably just Team MAGA warning everyone about what they plan on doing after Trump loses.
Our entire existence as we know it is based on a fictional narrative set up by the FBI Mockingbird campaign all so trump could come 25 years later to save us from fake news?
Smh this is about injustice. The fact that you mention your personal experience shows insensitivity. You're unbelievable. You're the same people that can't find anything wrong with Donald Trump.

Could 2020 suck more? Defeating Trump in November would be the only saving grace.
"...remove Donald Trump and consign those who supported him in the Senate to the trash heap of history.” Rice said Biden was someone who could “heal and unify the nation.” Wow. Contradiction much. 'Unify' to socialism. We won't heal nor join in.
First, let’s be clear -Biden is not a socialist- he’s just not, as evidenced by his record over 40+ years. Second, the last 4 years prove Trump being “just a little more Republican than Biden” hasn’t helped the debt &amp; deficit, but it sure helped devastate the country. No thanks.

Trump trashes Obama's Lewis eulogy that pressed for voting rights. That fat malignant Narcissistic attacking President Obama’s spews hate shows just perverse Trump is.

Trump wants to use a part of the White House Lawn the Property to become KING!  If he accept his nomination on at the White House.  He is telling the people he is KING.  Also set ready other second term seeking persons to use such a high profile place.   congrats
Since Trump's acceptance speech would be at the WH, perhaps the MSM should re-consider carrying it live since they would be an accessory to the commission of a federal crime on federal property! Perhaps he should deliver his speech on Twitter?

If trump quits and pence steps in he can pardon trump. But trump doesn't want to leave the white house he'll fight like a wet cat to stay president.
In this case, the base WILL turn out, because it hates Trump so much. But the moderates on the fence are the ones whose choices are down to two: Vote Biden, or stay home. Biden cannot afford to scare them; if he does, they will stay home, and he will lose.

The interview was multiple examples of what I call the TRUMP 180 ° RULE. What a warped perspective on life this man has.
You answered your own question. I’m this Trump era, the news cycle can’t keep up.
A lot of polling is bullshit because it historically oversamples Democrats. Modeling is equally worthless in politics, most of the time.  But if  makes a call, it's pretty much gonna happen.  So if you're looking to see a Trump loss in November, you're in luck.

I don't think that anyone is doubting that Joe will be on the debate stage! Trump on the other hand it's a wait and see, but he'll probably find some excuse not to be there! Maybe he'll have Pence take his place?
Is he going for a trifecta? Trump is stupid enough to install an antisemitic ambassador to Germany just to spite Angela Merkel!

Yeah the age hurts. For all of Biden’s shortcomings as a candidate, one of his greatest strengths is one of Trump’s biggest weaknesses. His empathy. You know when Biden talks about suffering, he is not bullshitting. It’s such a stark contrast to Trump.
You know the theory that Hillary was the perfect opponent for Trump? That if he went up against anyone else, he would have lost? In a lot of ways, I think it can be said that Trump is the perfect opponent for Biden.
What a baby. It was a good interview, but these were not tough questions. Trump is just used to being sheltered and catered to his entire life.
I’m not talking about Trump. I’m talking strictly how Biden will be judged at the debates.

Trump Got Cooked in That Axios Interview
The quality of the  interview with Trump is objectively better than the  interview.
I still follow you even though I disagree with you at times for tweets like this. I have no problem calling out Democrats when they suck, and feel no alliance to the Democratic party. Also, it doesn’t take a raging liberal to come to the conclusion Trump should not be prez.
But FOX thought it was a great interview, though they won't run any of it without doing a lot of editing...a LOT of editing! Trump's propaganda network will soon be running out of good things to say about THEIR LEADER and then the real garbage talk will begin!
They've made me stronger in my commitment to President Trump. Love is definitely blind. Otherwise Kellyanne would have pinched that turd off long ago.

And suddenly Trump demands our vaccine is brought forward. What a mess
You are doing the same mistake Trump critics do. Creating a bar so low, that it doesn’t take much to look like something is a win for the opponent. Happens with Trump all the time. People act like he should be praised for his brief moments of being a normal functioning adult.

If you think these things only became bad or corrupt because of Trump, then you’re just stupid
Isn't "Thou shall not kill" one of the 10 Commandments? Guessing not in the evangelical bible. So what do we call this 'have to due" statement from Trump? It's a little more serious than "Let them eat cake" from Marie Antoinette. What are Melania's thoughts? Or Ivanka's?If they like Trump or McMahon, no.
Trump wants his base to think he will do what Congress and Senate ought to.  And they will believe it. Once they hear his lie, they will stick with the desired belief, no matter what, &amp; Trump knows this.
Please please please QUIT being "in disbelief" about anything trump does. The man is pure evil. Hell he might kill 10 million people with nukes before he leaves office, and you are STILL capable of being "in disbelief" that he would stage a show at his club during a pandemic??
👀 😲shocking that there might be corruption 🙄 I’m calling it now that some trump affiliate buys tik tok too to access any potential “information” gathered. They don’t get to be/stay successful by being honest businessmen 🤷🏻‍♀️
That’s Trump for the next 200 years 😂
There's needs to be a law that overrides Executive Orders that a crooked president takes away things that upsets him personally. Trump is the example of abusing Executive Orders when certain things get under his skin,More like retaliation. #TrumpIsACompleteFailure
Huge news!!!  Trump announces executive order repealing prohibition!  Take that Rex Banner!
after Trump will never vote Republican again no matter who or what.
We must get trump OUT. The only way to do that is vote for BIDEN. Period. One of those 2 will be president.
For BIDEN. Unless you want another 4 years of trump.
Trump supporters
Now playing  - POG Interview.mp3 Listen here:  #trump
Trump...Russia...GOP,Yep! They know they trying to make sure Trump gets reelected and trying to slow down the USPS to sabotage Mail-In voting and Moscow Mitch won't sign the bill to stop interference...Yeah,Everyone already connecting the dots together if not already.
Who does he he is? The rules of wearing a mask is  to keep us All safe.  Oh, I forgot,  Trump and Cruz,  along with their supporters don't care if we all get coronavirus and die.  As long as they aren't inconvenienced!
Trump and the Republicans prove once again that they don't care about American people.  They only care about the rich,  who actually received the tax breaks. Vote Democrat.
Seriously, where have you been the past 4 years? 😂 These cult members of trump’s are like every crazy evangelical who gives ppl like Paula White their life’s savings. They’re happy for NRA and trump family to live in great wealth.
And y’all smear Trump 24:7... your Russia just on the other side of the table.
I’m still a believer that the Trump presidency is just a Nathan For You bit that’s gone too far
Upset with the president? It appears  is too. Here’s some raw footage of him speaking to donors about how “pissed off at Donald Trump” he is because veterans aren’t receiving health care.
Carefully worded , he “went” to Wharton . Trump is dumb as a road lizard , as my dad would say ! 😂😂
No matter how hard life gets I’d never vote for trump or Kanye 🗑 🤡
Live look at commercial break with every trump surrogate who  is interviewing 😂
Trump praising success backwards, What's horrible for America is a success for him. It's official,He's sick in the head...and I'm not surprised at that and mainly the majority of this country. Getting rid of him will be the only way to save America from him &amp; his bullshit!
It must be nice to live in this fantasy world where people pretend “abstaining” from the Presidential vote counts for anything other than a vote for Trump
Trump’s America: First to worst. ‘It is what it is’
Please clarify.  Did the White House play  Live and Let Die, or is the  Trump Campaign playing it?
I am really confused. I’ve no doubt Trump is racist. But  Trump’s crew is looking more like a minstrel show. I’d expect to see Lincoln Perry next.
(But most of the Catholics I know, the very conservative ones, aren’t in the Trump camp. They’re just off doing their own thing in the corner somewhere)
A woman is about as valuable to trump as a piece of gum stuck on the bottom of his shoe but many whyte women will line up to vote by the thousands .
I agree. But this is how Joe really thinks. He's not the savvy Obama makeover. He inserts his foot over and over because he doesn't measure his words like a really good politician does. Trump, he doesn't pretend to be a politician. He just wants to help America to be great!
what’s funnier: Donald Trump not knowing there/their/they’re or thinking he’s going to win the “Black Vote”
We're still going to vote for Joe Biden! Trump had his chance, his goose is cooked! Trump knows if he doesn't win he's going to jail! Trump is nothing but a crook and we know it ! F-Trump!
One things for sure:  security concerns or not, a pandering career politician would never take such a risk. Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump
Heck no! A pandering career politician would never take such a risk.  Our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump
One things for sure:  security concerns or not, a pandering career politician would never take such a risk. For you folks that don't get it, our current #POTUS is putting the well-being of our people ahead of his own political interests. Pretty refreshing if you ask me. #Trump

Can somebody please explain why Trump is so worried about TikTok than the pandemic thats going on!

“Moesha Trump in the house!!!” Did not age well lol
if you don’t stop behaving as if you are Gods gift to people of color, and take time to learn why your words are offensive; you are going to doom us to 4 more years of Trump and we’re all going to die. No pressure
I have recently started replacing any headlines that mention “Trump” with “Florida Man” in my head. Seems more fitting
Trump is bad at his job
Trump is the lowest human being using God and the Holy Bible to gain advantage over a political opponent. Peace through understanding 🔥
That dont mean he doesnt support trump.
Trump losing more than his approval rating,He's losing his goddamn mind! "Hurt God"...Seriously?! Trump is literally making his own case that he's is a insane madman. 4 more years of this bullshit and God himself might just smite Trump. #TrumpIsUnwell #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
It is trump's party. Period. It is a party of disgusting racists. Period
Let’s see: a disgraced former football coach living high on the hog with taxpayer dollars; no experience or skill (such as it was) outside of football; no policy ideas; a Trump bootlicker. Sounds like the perfect Alabama Republican Senate candidate.
I thought Trump was just BSing but then I saw this photo of a young Biden.
No way he last that long, hell he can't come up with one sentence on his own that you can understand. He will not debate Trump. They picked the wrong man to lead their party.
He look like a trump supporter
Trump has been in little girls bathroom and bragged about seeing them naked .
What is/will be Facebook's role in misinformation attempts during the current election cycle?
If Joe Biden could decisively destroy the god worshiped by Trump’s supporters, he would be doing an inestimable service to America and the world.
The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad is problematic as hell and a Trump supporter. So....
Donald Trump trying to be the President he thinks Ricky Bobby wants him to be
How powerful does Donald Trump think Joe Biden is if he says he will “hurt God”
I wouldn't vote for someone who's crazy like Kanye west! He needs to be in the crazy house talking about when he put on a maga hat he feels like super man what a idiot he is, but if he wants to waste his money let him , hell trump is just using his crazy ass!
The republicans kept on backing trump and now you guys want to to blame the democrats for all you guys bullshit and that's not right! Trump and you guys are going to pay at the polls so get ready! Trump and you guys killed a lot of Americans with all your lies!
I bet the NRA corruption is gonna be connected to Trump and the GOP that serves him. The puzzles are being pieced together,Something tells me Trump's fear of not getting re-elected &amp; losing will be the least of his worries and Deutsche Bank is another puzzle piece too.
Will the left-leaning national media jump all over Biden for this? I know if it were Trump they would....
What a godsend for the Trump campaign.😋🔥🔥#KAG2020 #KAG2020LandslideVictory
This grandstanding politician is going to hurt the Biden cause.  Talk about something sure to fire up the Trump base, sheesh!🔥🔥
Aye, and her grandstanding will undermine the Biden bid and generate even more support for Trump.
Definitely wouldn’t be my #1 choice. Unfortunately, he’s the only choice with the backing to get rid of Trump. 😩
At this point, I wanna fight everyone that voted for Trump.... cause we’re doomed
Trump,”My view is the schools should open.This thing is going away. It will go away like all things go away,&amp;my view is that schools should open.{THE FOLLOWING IS A LIE}Children are almost-I would almost say definitely-but almost immune from the disease.” Think you missed a quote
Question: does anybody in my Twittersphere still have family/loved ones who are supporting Trump right now? How are you holding them accountable for the state of our country right now? (Humor is welcome, but also I’m serious.)
So don't vote for pedo trump
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are both corrupt politicians. George Washington would have disapproved of them both.
I think the same thing when liberals cry about Trump.
Those consequences might finally be coming down on Trump. #ConsequencesForTrump
This is insane...  All of Trump’s Lies About the Coronavirus - The Atlantic
Trump has ducked and dodged the consequences for so long now,It time for everyone in this country to hold him,his enabler and his MAGA cult accountable,We already have crossed that bridge long enough! #ConsequencesForTrump #TrumpIsADisgrace #TrumpFailedAmerica
FAIR: Trump’s Tantrum Against TikTok Is No Laughing Matter -
Seems like a lot to point out a photoshopped picture. What’s the point if it happens all the the time? I don’t see that much concern when people get butthurt over photoshopped Trump pictures.
Trump treating his press conference like at TV show,Because that what is is. He's lies,Spread misinformation,and any other bullshit he can come up with because he's desperate for attention. Not surprising everyone already knows this! You know you can change the channel.
I talk a lot about being a virgin but honestly, I almost lost it in undergrad but changed my mind at the last minute. But lmao, call it blessed intuition because he turned into a trump supporter a few years later.   Also, i vet white men now.
Someone needs to tell him Alabama isn’t the opponent anymore. Wait until Trump finds out. He’s gonna be in sooooo much trouble.
Not to mention: there’s a snowball’s chance in hell Donald Trump can drive a stick.
get of your ass and tell trump to leave the post offices alone trying to slow up the mail! You guys know he's doing it , stop the cheating , this is my vote not you guys cheating ass!

It’s hard to think of tRump as the end result of millions of years of evolution.
BIG NEWS,Trump still pulling his own tricks to distract us for his corruption,lies,&amp; failures! Another "Wash,Rinse,&amp; Repeat" cycle in his playbook.
I haven't seen in my life how stupid those Senators questioning Sally Yates sound. Someone please show them how they look and sound. Grown men with President Obama obsession and during Trump bullying cult mess. Ted Cruz Kennedy Graham Just so pathetic.
The ‘All Lives Matters, Trump 2020, Blue Lives Matter, Anti-Mask, Pro-life’ Crew.
Trump said yall lying about them Corona numbers. Send them to the white house  He saw them number and the next thing he did was strap a mask to his face and say he was super patriotic
This is they guy y’all want to be President of the United States?!? 🤣  All I have to say TRUMP 2020 👊🏻
Trump rn
Anybody that continues to support trump is just choosing to be apart of the madness at this point.... it’s sad as fuck how idiotic this man is🤦🏾‍♂️
These are all very strong intelligent women.  As mothers and grandmothers they are use to seeing children throw temper tantrums when they don't get their way.  They will put Trump in the corner for a time out.
It's time Trump has a nice long retirement.  Voting Biden.
Trump has Always been Jealous of Obama.  He continues to prove almost 4 years after the last election.
Trump is such a Liar and Fraud.  Americans are supposed to be so Dumb that we shouldn't figure out that the Only reason he approved mail in voting in Florida is because he fears losing due to Democrats huge numbers of requests to vote by mail.
Trump is his daddy
Putin has Trump on strings,Trump has GOP Senators &amp; GOP Congress on strings. At this point,They are too far gone and when you are too far gone you'll end up like those people in The Walking Dead.
As long as it help our 401-k good. They quit listening to Trump
Trump hates people that tells the truth or fact-checks him. He only wants me his words to matter,Not the reality of what's happening. He's proving his own case why he's unfit to be president the GOP &amp; MAGA knows this too but won't admit it. Everyone else is smart enough to notice
We need a counter for every time Trump says the words "fake news" because it seems that he has something to hide but it's not surprising because that "Hitler Playbook" exposing him w/o question. Everyone already knows those tricks is wearing themselves out.

You guys are great at this mindfuk of trump. He won’t be able to keep his shit together.
Trump thinks he’ll be the next Rupert Murdoch with his 2 sons Beavis and Butthurt-but unlike Murdoch, trump will bankrupt trump tv within 2 years.
If you think Trump is a threat to democracy.. ohhhhh boy you’re really sitting on the wrong side of the aisle my dude..
Pelosi used state capture to acquire wealth. Trump inherited a ton then grew it as an entertainer playing businessman. Are you so blind in trump hate to not say Pelosi used her position to get rich?
Trump can’t stop the Chinese Virus; however like all viruses, it will run its course. BUT you could have stopped #Benghazi and saved lives and also reported that #BillClintonIsAPedofile
Oh he meant to. He is filth. Trump is filth.
Trump learnin these haters 😂
Trump was NOT correct. We have 480 deaths per 1 mil population. The entire world has 87 deaths per 1 mil population. We are 7th worst out of 200 countries in deaths per capita. 193 countries better than us, only 7 worse.
We need a coherent Federal plan for getting through this. Three weeks ago Trump said he'd show us his health care plan "in two weeks."  Re: Cuomo, also abhorrent &amp; I won't defend it because, unlike some, I don't worship power &amp; excuse failure by pointing fingers elsewhere.
trump works?? 😂 😂 😂 Works on his golf score, and he can't even accomplish that because he has the worst swing I've ever seen. I HATE golf, never play, and even I can hit straighter than he can. Jesus H. tap-dancing Christ at the prom, you bots think we 🇺🇸 are stupid, huh?
Watch "Trump Humiliated In Worst Interview in History" on YouTube
Your insinuation was that most white rep. will vote Tuberville because he is a Trump puppet. That’s untrue. Most Alabamians vote for those that reflect their morals and values.  Sometimes it’s the lesser of two evils.  Insulting us because we believe different is immature.
Everyone in this country should know that your not only voting to get Trump out of office or vote his GOP &amp; MAGA enablers out,You're voting to save our country from them and their bullshit because we're not gonna put up for it for another 4 years,Hell No to that...VOTE IN NOV.!
Trump is trying to sabotage,cheat,&amp; steal the election! That is the best and easier way to say it because it's the truth. No Narratives,No Media Spins,No Conspiracy Theories,It's A Cold Hard Reality Fact! Everyone that wants him gone better vote like their life depends on it!
There’s absolutely no proof of that... testing is actually getting faster each and every week in most states.. slow testing falls on your state governments not Trump.
Nah. Only thing that would’ve probably prevented that is an entire national lockdown.. and you would’ve had an issue with that too. Trump is doing all he can from a government stand point.
Trump 2020 and  2024!
Trump wouldn’t miss it for the world. And neither will I, although it’s going to be a complete 💩 show.  #Trump2020Landslide 🇺🇸
This criticism assumes there’s no difference in confessing to a stranger on the phone that you’re a Trump supporter as Biden.   There’s a huge difference and it explains why polling might be off in one direction only. It’s the Doug Wilder effect.
Was sent this information feom the Trump administration. Recieved much more information aswell! See you in court!
Great work done by the Trump Administration!
Trump doesn't care about the thousands dying of Covid 19. He sure won't care if he is successful in stirring up some kind of trouble to get people killed on the streets to try to disrupt the election.
Imagine how Yosemite Sam would feel when he realizes that Trump mis-pronounced his name Yo-Semite.
Yes it was verified, thats not even debateable. Now ask yourself if you are okay with how trump has dismissed this fact repetively after admitting HIMSELF its true.
Lol. Lose to whom??  Put Biden under the same questioning and Trump will look fabulous. And it’s a 2 man race you know.
Absentee Voting is the exact same thing as Mail-in voting. Mail-in voting is secure in all 50 states, not just Florida, there has never been a case of massive voter fraud in America. Trump is just saying this about Florida because he wants to justify why he votes by Mail there.
I don’t see many Trump signs because people are afraid of being targeted... their cars and/or homes being vandalized.
that Trump interview 😂😂😂 he really don’t give a fuck
Trump: We can't go by the cases because the cases are up due to increased testing.  Trump: our deaths are lower than the world. You have to go by the cases.  Sir, you can't have it both ways.
Trump sounds like a lot of you Twitter Doctors who think this is the common cold.
The John Lewis question was a softball any interviewer would’ve thrown out — easy to answer, easy to get right, literally requires just a few words. Trump didn’t have it in him.
Exactly. Trump has been remarkably blessed by his crazy unhinged enemies.
How long before they are tho?  It’s the non-Trump pols that seem the most eager to shut down anything resembling fun or normal life. UTAustin purported to ban parties yesterday!  Trump derangement seems to have turned libs into buzzkill Maude Flanders types. Amazing.
Trump had the goddamn nerve to say he done more for Black Americans than John Lewis. Keep his name out of your mouth you dumb orange bastard. Please everyone,Vote so we can get rid of that narcissist asshole. America can't not stand another 4 years of him! #TrumpIsAnIdiot
The thing that's obvious when you watch this is that   "he was in Congress"  "he's Black"  "he didn't come to my inauguration", and   "he's dead now"   is the *absolute sum total* of what Donald Trump knows about John Lewis.  Beyond that he has NO CLUE who they're talking about.
President Trump Just Called Out Two of the Media’s Most Dangerous Lies About COVID-19.
#YesWeCanAgain we will overcome after  is long gone. tRump prison bound!! Oh what a day that will be. I want normalcy back
But yet tRump demands our children go back to public school, he could careless about our children or any child....remember he has locked children I'm caged away from their parents and molested many young girls!!
It’s increasingly clear Trump is completely surrounded by True Believers in the White House, which is basically the most dangerous possible situation for both him and the country.
When did Biden say he was scared to debate Trump?
Trump is like
Trump just shows how dumb most Americans are. I'm glad I learned this lesson in my lifetime.
OMG! How dumb is this MF so-called president is! Trump is incapable of accepting the truth or a loss. Please vote his ass out in November I can't express that enough!
Trump is like Faust, except he traded America's soul to the Devil instead of his own.
Why does your tweet leave out that trump said "he didn't come to my inauguration"
i’m just saying if trump pushes the election i’m fighting in the civil war
Could there be a viable class action law suite by US citizens against Trump for his absolute failure to meet even the barest level of of competency for his job, etc., etc., as our president?
Trump is more of a cult leader than a president(if he ever was) and Trump's GOP Loyalists &amp; MAGAs people are his cult followers. With a dangerous cult like that,There's that one road for them and it's covered w/red all over it and I'm not taking about GOP or MAGA colors!
Maybe those MAGA &amp; GOP Idiots should ask Trump is he's too afraid to release his tax returns instead of creating conspiracy theories or any other bullshit. But then again I forgot that they rather turn a blind eye than face the truth because they are for Trump and not America!
Trump = FAKE NEWS.  Anyone who fails to tow THE PARTY LINE   COVID 19 is his enemy EVEN Leaders of the COVID 19 TASK FORCE SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER.   Watch "Burnett: Trump calls Dr. Birx pathetic after she tells the truth" on YouTube
So I hear. I think they’re just Trump haters.

Do you hear yourself when you talk,I'm sorry you must be overdosed of the Trump Kool-Aid is affecting your common sense of reality.
Trump is counting on somebody stealing/cheating for him to win the election,That's the reality. His desperation and fear of mail-in voting shows that he knows it's a losing battle that could go either way for him. I'm voting to save America from him,You should to Americans!
The polls don't decide whether Trump approval ratings is up or down,That's for the America people to decide and given that majority of us already knows that he's a desperate loser that likes to keep himself in a bubble to keep out hearing the truth.
Trump will never admit that he's paying or bribing people to fake his approval numbers. Rasmussen for example,It purpose is to only get his MAGA &amp; right-wing stooges to get excited. Mostly everyone already seen this smoke &amp; mirrors trick so many times it we can read it w/E's!
💵 🍩 Isn’t this like the kiss of death? Oh my. Trump and Brooks. Plus all the financial scandals. And the loyalty issues. At least he’s republican in Alabama.
Can someone please educate me on why trump wants tik tok taken down? It seems so stupid with everything going on
Does Trump ever look in a mirror and ever think that he's the real "Enemy Of The People"? But I keep forgetting that he's to ignorant to admit that. He's really wearing out Hitler's playbook and the "enemy" does take orders from their puppet master, Putin. #TrumpIsLosing
Is that Trump flag waiting on a SpaceX splash down? #Nauticalscience not Pseudoscience
I certainly am. I hope God intervenes and Trump wins by a landslide
So afraid for our country! Trump is dangerous beyond anything I could have imagined as a president! Ala. has the highest positive Covid 19/Trump-virus rate in the country and Trump is still pushing lies &amp; confusion!
Will you name/list the job opportunities?  Where are all those fossil fuel job opportunities that trump promised?  Where is the new healthcare reform?
Why does trump hire so many pathetic losers in the first place. Does he EVER hire anyone who is any good at anything? So many times he told us he had "the best people". And there would be so much winning. But there's just LOSING and DEATH. worst president in history
1. Long the "uncool" name in technology, Microsoft is trying to change that as it continues its bid to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok. Talks are ongoing, including between CEO Satya Nadella and President Trump.

that train works great if you can follow people but Twitter locked me down 6/2017 and won’t let me follow anyone because I love Trump and hate these commie idiots and Chinese crappers
You weren’t saying this stuff on 3/25/20.... you actually agreed with Trump and the Republicans saying that “Tik Tok is a national security threat that should only be used to call out the Chinese government....” so,  what changed??? 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Trump’s a Hitler supporter. The things that he sells in the store has the price tag of 88 which in German means “hail hitler”
I hope that the strongly suspected financial ties Trump likely has to the manufacture and sale of  hydroxychloroquine, are found out, that Trump is prosecuted for that corruption, and for the rest of his corruption.
Have theyw told trump that? Is he going to obey?  LOL what a ridiculously naive tweet. Dems need to vote IN PERSON EARLY
that won't work. Because trump won't play along. He will tell people he has won every state where he leads on election night and they will believe it and claim fraud when it changes. Mail in is a massively stupid idea. Vote early IN PERSON - with distancing and a mask
NOTHING the media says will change the fact that trump will claim victory in any state he leads on election night. Dems emphasizing mail in ballots instead of early IN PERSON voting (social distanced with a mask) is one of the stupidest moves EVER
Sorry dude,Your speaking Trump language. Not everyone else that is not blind.
While Trump's goons &amp; those GOP idiots trying to say violence has escalated in Portland since secret police left, Funny they must be crazy in the head,I see they been doing peaceful protest to mostly everyone else but that what people under Trump would say to push his agenda!

Trump will never be able to join the President club because it's for "real Presidents" and Trump is puttins puppet!
Now more than ever, we need President Trump re-elected do he can continue to uncover all of you and  criminal activities
Lol. Sleepy Joe would have slept through it. The same guy that called Trump a racist for closing down travel from China esrly on? Keep drinking the kool aide.
How was your Trump dream last night? Is he paying rent for your brain? Lol.
...but voting third party in this election is essentially a vote for the current administration. We know 3rd party isn’t going to win, so in swing states in particular, it essentially ensures another 4 years of Trump, which is dangerous for vulnerable people.
LGBT are vulnerable with Trump/Pence. Black people. Undocumented people. Hispanic people. Children being torn from their families in ICE centers where they are denied proper medical care and are actively abused. It may not consciously have sinister intentions, I’d agree...
Sorry even when Nazis die, but maybe now some of his followers will start wearing masks.
Clinton only won it by 1.5%. 538's average has it at 0.7% redder than the national average. If there were an election today, Biden would win it, but if Trump makes up ground, it's certainly one of the states that he could win.
Hay trump is on drugs, it's called "lien".
Wow Trump is a American hero, 'Not' he's using them as props to make himself look good! If you notice Trump never looked at the lady who was crying, cause Trump has not feeling's for people who's hurting!
Fromm the very beginning trump has proved to be unqualified for the office. In contrast Hillary Clinton was over qualified. Don’t vote on promises! Vote for purpose and experience.
“Biden is up one in Georgia, and the last time a Democrat won there, Athens' hometown band R.E.M. had just released its 1992 classic ‘Automatic for the People.’”  ⁦ with the REM/Athens plug on this write-up of Biden’s 1-point GA lead:
.. but your only complaint is that Trump is ‘intentionally slowing mail.’
Just devil’s advocate here: we continue to research hip strength and we find conflicting results, but we as clinicians continue to implement hip focused interventions for ACL rehab/prevention. Sometimes clinical practice can trump what the data says.
Lindsey Graham is just a Trump Butt KISSER. Not to mention a pretty good Liar.
You've Wasted over 3 years of Not coming up with a Health Care Plan. America is ready to turn the channel on the Trump show. Voting Biden on November 3rd.
Trump doesn't want America to see the poor turnout for his nomination.  Many people will stay home and vote online.
Trump is right. Nobody does like him.  He will find out how True that is on November 3rd.
Golfing while America is dying from a preventable death,  if we had the right leadership. Voting Biden.  Time to Dump Trump.
So, different rules for the little rich boys. Trump is a hypocrite.

So....we should be more Christ like and support Biden who likes groping kids....all I'm hearing out of liberal nut jobs is pedofiles are okay. As long as they aren't Trump you'll take anything. Also Jesus taught us to love one another not hate your fellow man
Really cause your precious Fauci said he believes Trump prevented a lot of deaths. But tell us since you're an expert what would you have done differently....
I sometimes wonder how the day Trump dies will be. I lowkey don’t even see him as a human being. The internet might crash like it did when Michael Jackson died except it won’t be from people searching out of sadness and shock. It’s gonna be a whole lotta “GO!! GO!! GO!!” energy.
Wait, do people actually believe this?  I thought everyone knew anyone attributing Sarah Cooper to Trump banning Tik Tok was a joke.
You’re right. The problem is, Joe is just a miserable person. Trump runs through his head 24/7. What a miserable way to live
Trump was not and is not terrified of Bernie. Trump wanted to run against Bernie so bad he could not contain his excitement at the thought of it, and his anger that it ended up being Biden. The capacity you bernie supporters have for delusion is scary
They really have a problem with messaging.  According to Trump, if they didn't test, then there would be zero cases in Congress.
You're literally telling people if they don't vote Trump, they're voting for evil.  Don't you claim to be a "freethinker" or some dumb shit?
Honey, that was straight up the work of the Clinton’s and the Royals. How many times was Trump on Epstein’s flight logs?
MAGAs,Trump goons and Russian boys wanna bring up Bill Clinton is a pedo but they forget Trump maybe more guilty than Clinton because Trump will be the one who has the most to lose! #DonaldTrumpIsAPedo #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
He’s a clown enjoying his new fame. I’m not defending Trump, but it’s long past time to put Fauci out to pasture.  “Could change” my ass.  Either he knew it would or he’s incompetent.  Hell I thought it would be a problem in January just from reading about the Ch Dr whistleblower
Trump makes it clear how he feels about pedo island back in feb 2015
Along with the unprofessional and greedy athletes are the college teachers that should all lose their over paid jobs. Everyone should self resign from college and bankrupt the costly universities. Besides there will be a lot less jobs due to trump economics.

The was tried with Obama about Jeremiah Wright . Trump could have moved Stormy Daniels in the WH with him and Melania and the right would not have cared one bit .
Trump doesn’t send police protection to Republican cities because we don’t tolerate Antifa and violence. Simple facts.
Explain to me how Trump responsible for a pandemic that originated in China? Pelosi was partying in Chinatown and blasting Trump &amp; Fauci’s recommendations to shelter in place. Covid has been rampant without restraint when social distancing was ignored. Personal responsibility.
I understand your fear about returning to the classroom. Covid has been hard to get under control. Fauci led the charge with guidelines and Birx followed in lock step. Both of them are Democrats. Trump looks to his advisors for policy &amp; Governors had the final word on lockdowns.
Trust me. Knowing President Trump he always has a plan. Just not revealing it right now. Vote your conscience without fear on Nov. 3rd.
The Trump boat parades....
Outstanding work by the Trump administration! Thank you!

Who shows up for 45? Hardly anyone.
These are actually just the next five words in Trump’s mental acuity test.
"I am here to bear reluctant witness that Mr. Trump didn’t hijack the Republican Party. He is the logical conclusion of what the party became over the past 50 or so years, a natural product of the seeds of race-baiting, self-deception and anger that now dominate it."Here is something from three months ago. But I hadn’t seen anything about this until that Biden tweet tbh
Another attempt by trump to cheat and win the election.
Heidi: To help you understand how President Trump won in 2016, read the Constitution. As for Russian help, it was all to Hillery, — after nearly 49 M wasted, Mueller could not any evidence of Russian help to our President. Recommendation-time to grow up &amp; stop believing Dims.
The FDA will be required to develop a list of essential medicines covered under the order. At a minimum, the order will apply to drugs and supplies needed to combat emergencies such as pandemics, bioterror attacks and other threats. |
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn’t trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can’t fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We’ve got to find better people to run.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don’t want the blacks to think that.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you’re a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump’s recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won’t work!
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. 😂😂😂
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.
I am voting for Trump.
I am voting for Trump.
You have no back to back up your claims. In fact you’re spreading misinformation. Tree I think Twitter and Facebook does not allow that. Maybe better clean up your act and get your facts straight. Donald Trump is beating you at your own game.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
What the hell?? Everyone of us in health care and directly involved with Covid-19 efforts known Donald Trump POLITICALIZED this pandemic. EVERYBODY!!  Don’t start pulling this lying game with America! It’s YOU. Not Democrats or Republicans. YOU!!

Oh and the navy ship actually had a big ceremony requested by Trump before it left for NY. So yeah.. fanfare.
As I recall, Fauci, CDC and WHO didn’t want a run on existing N95s which were in short supply globally. Also, I recall Fauci recommending a face covering and Trump said he would not be wearing one. On live TV.
Basically “Trump’s a dumb old man? What do y’all want?!?”
Trump is not the dictator of America.
trump, it’s the banning tiktok for me
hello donald trump yes i live in america not a communist country please don’t take my tiktok away this is a free country
Hey, remember at the beginning of the outbreak when Trump wanted to close the borders to infected countries but was then called racist?
Yes !!! Thank you for covering our President Trump in prayers.
Got beachfront property in the Florida panhandle? Trump says he ‘ordered’ no drilling off the Florida coast but there’s no evidence of any such order
I like Trump’s policies, and I like that he was willing to give up his comfortable life to fight for conservative principles.
Editorial cartoon: Trump’s America: First to worst. ‘It is what it is’
These are the faces of evil. I hope they all go to jail,but I know they won’t. We could never get a conviction in the deep state area, but Trump will be hounded the rest of his life for trying to MAGA.  I am so glad I don’t live in Trump-hating states.
What is your point? Trump shows  up in companies that are manufacturing things Americans need to thank them and show us what is being done here in America. I don’t care that he doesn’t throw a pitch at a baseball game. Why do you?
What does Putin have on Trump? His deference to Putin is undisputed. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
saying Michele Obama pronounces words wrong?  Please. Trump just this week. Thighland and Yo Semites? #trumpmispronounces
Headline is wrong.  It should read, “15 Stupid and/or alcoholic adults drink hand sanitizer”.  No one just does that; and it’s always someone who knows better.  It’s not an epidemic and Trump didn’t cause it.
read Mary Trump’s book.  I did.  What an idiot.
If I had balls, I would stick it out until someone figured out that it was a reference to Trump fans criticizing JL for "getting too political." But I really can't handle that stress right now.
So sad that he is being used! I know he is not well but he put himself in a position to kiss up to Trump. Trump and those Republicans should be ashame of using a man who is not mentally stable.
I too am interested to hear more about this country of #Thighland Donald Trump spoke of.
Who is the staffer who matches the speech backdrop to complexion and I feel like I could live with myself if that was my only role in the Trump admin.
Your Music Sux anyway Neil I don’t understand why PRESIDENT TRUMP would want to play your SOCIALIST LIBERAL SNOWFLAKE MUSIC.

That was a bad take tonight on  Comparing Trump’s calling BLM a symbol of hate is nothing like what Biden said. BLM funds go directly to Liberal PAC!
Right now never Trump means a path to socialism because that is the choice we have in Nov. I choose Trump’s policies.
No sarcasm here, NRA needs to go, along with trump.

This is exactly what Trump voters do when Trump say some objectively dumb shit.  "Oh no your taking it out of context what he really meant by saying all mexicans were drug dealers and criminals was that all mexicans dont vote republican.  And black voters do." 🤦🏼‍♂️
That is what they said about Obama. What a joke. Republicans and Trump are fools. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Trump is attacking Joe Biden’s faith, saying he is “against God.” The campaign should make an ad about his faith and how it drives his politics. Trump is the guy that hold a church crowd he doesn’t ask for forgiveness.
But I thought Trump was racist? Between “you ain’t black” and this, Joe has made it pretty clear how he feels about the black community.
Obama mama Michelle has depression bc “ Trump’s cause of racial problems “.   The O-B Adm with weaponizing of the DOJ, FBI, etc. were conniving b4 Trump was elected with major attempted destruction of Trump.  Any race problems were here long ago and not help by O-B one bit.

This is the sad state of our nation. THAT NO MATTER WHAT DAMAGE TRUMP AND HIS GOONS LIKE THE PAMPERED SON IN LAW DO THERE IS 4 out of 10 white voters who just don’t care. They only want White Supremacy.
I hope so. If it was Trump they would for sure. Amazing how Biden gets away with so much over the last 40 years!
What a political hack is this NY AG, trying to destroy the NRA to attack President Trump and our 2nd Amendment rights as “CITIZENS” to keep and bear arms.
You went to the #Trump school of law didn’t you
Not shock at all I know at least one person who is proud to tell me he supports Trump even after intense discussion about the state of our union and rampant racism! I get the same old retort, I am discriminated against too because ...... it is hurtful!
Op-Ed: Tuberville must do more than bury his nose in Trump’s bum. We need to hear Tuberville’s plan, where he stands on the issues, what he’ll bring to #Alabama that Jones hasn’t already. Let’s hear it, Coach. But you’ll have to scoot back a bit first.
Of all the things that have happened this year, this may be the most shameful. Trump should be singing his praises instead of criticizing him for trying to help get us out of this mess. Disgusting. God Bless Dr. Fauci and his family.

If Trump had  not lied and had implemented a national plan, we would have had a football season. Because he mislead, covered up and distracted, there will be very little football this fall.

I bet you wouldn’t recommend no debates if you thought Biden could win. You sleazy deep staters think we are so dumb as to think you care about the work that has been done. You just don’t want Trump to win again - hey, whatever it takes you are on board.

You are correct.  One of the callers even said that schools need to be closed so parents can’t go back to work because that will continue the devastation of Trump’s economy.  He didn’t use these exact words, but that was his point.  It’s insane.

i am trump supporter but it doesnt look good for his party. it is too difficult to win as Republican because NY and CA carry so many electoral vote
I don’t like trump and even I believe joe till perform poorly in the debates. He could shock us all if he actually came out looking sharp. Don’t see it happening.
Trump is a fool. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
Trump doesn't possess a rigorous mindset. He tends to blur details when he has to process them quickly at a wholesale level. (And when he doesn't really care much about them. Which is most of the time)  Pelosi is just flat-out lying and knows she is.  There's a difference.
Trump is an outlier, primarily because HRC ran one of the poorer campaigns in US Presidential history.  At least I trust that is the case......
Your just begging for votes you dummy! Latinos and other cultures are not stupid! Stop using pity and ignorance to try and sway the Americans in this country your way. We know what your up to and it’s not working sleepy Pervy joe! Trump is the way!!!!!!! Your all going to prison!
Keep in mind this is an opinion piece. From who knows where. You’ll get no arguement from me that joe has some mental issues. The debates with trump and Hilary were also pointless. Cmon. Are you really gonna tell me you didn’t have your mind made up before the debates?

President Trump is in  head so bad
Could you maybe pick a time when at least one left-leaning Supreme Court seat isn't likely up for grabs?  If Trump is reelected, the courts will be stacked HARD against a progressive agenda for decades.
This.  A re-elected Trump will overwhelmingly stack the deck for several decades.
Don't let the importance of this next presidential election be understated.  I fully believe that if Trump is reelected in 2020, the deck in the federal courts &amp; including supreme court will be stacked hard against a progressive agenda for decades to come, with no route to fix.
If you are a democrat who sees a path to a presidential election result in 2020 that doesn't re-elect Trump and that doesn't elect the Democrat nominee, by all means enlighten the rest of us.  Many of us are independents who are voting against, not voting for.
What kind of man would sign up to work for Trump? A scum bag, that is who. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace

I doubt they're actually trump supporters qanon. Too young and diverse a group. Think this is fake.
It's a very diverse, in all but age, group of trump supporters. Very suspect to me. Looks pretty black flag operationny. #blackflagoperation
God bless our wonderful President Trump
We love our wonderful President Trump
Trump is the Man.   Build  that Wall.
Can't wait for Trump's 1st appearance on Celebrity Call Center.
So Trump wants president Pelosi? OK with me!
Show me evidence that the NYTimes covered for the Trump Administration.
Ok then Joe , you had 8 long years to do something and you didn’t.  Trump has that patented already.
Bro. We know, all the fearful and old Fox News types are voting for Trump.   Still not enough of y’all.
OMG! I mean I HAD A FEELING TRUMP WAS GOING TO BE A BAD PRESIDENT. BUT I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE THIS HORRIFIC IN SO MANY WAYS. We have GOP SENATE TO THANK. They covered up his crimes in FEBRUARY. THEY MUST PAY WITH THEIR JOBS IN NOVEMBER!!! Again OMG!
I wonder how much sickness and death Trump has to confront before he realizes that it was all born out of his own failed response to the outbreak.
Instead the media has allowed tRump to again chg the narrative. He’s bragging abt it in a recent tweet. No longer are we talking abt what’s really urgent- we can only talk abt moving the election and mail in votes. Media is complicit with the worse prez ever! #tRumpvirus
Bernell Trammell. We need to remember his name. He was murdered because he was your supporter. Do all lives matter? Did anyone offer to pay for his funeral? Where is the outrage? I don't like the world I'm living in now. Re-elect Donald J Trump for president. Only hope.
She is a danger and should never be allowed back into the UK. Just my opinion as an American. I guarantee Trump would never allow her to return to the US. She made her bed she can lie in it. I don't care if she was 15 and stupid. Now she's just dangerous.
I'd like to believe that, but with Scotty Bowman and Adam Enre liking Trump tweets, Robin Lehner and Tony Deangelo being known supporters, Tim Thomas being himself, etc. it seems likely split.
I think I would give my left nut before I would vote for Trump!Pres. Trump holds Friday evening briefing
I don't advocate vandalism, but what's good for the goose is good for the gander. How many times has Donald Trump's stars been vandalized?
The largest part of the Trump trolls I run across don't seem to really believe any of their propaganda. They come across as lukewarm about their political views at best. I expect most of the trolls are being paid for their loyalty to Trump.
Trump could use a little humbleness, but thanks to the media he can’t show any weakness. If he did, they’d attack him like rabid dogs. Well, kind of like they do now. He’s been the best thing for the country in years. Go Trump!
Strange how the loudest libs who hate Trump, are also the ones who appear to have something to hide
They were gonna screw with whomever went against Trump.  It doesn't matter if he is in their pocket or just stupid, Putin knows in either case he still wins with Trump and loses with anyone else.
Most trump voters voted to keep Hillary out
and many of those will probably vote for Trump. Just sayin'.
I don't think Trump handled this very well, especially in the beginning. With that said, I think you can attribute these numbers to the selfishness of Americans in general as much if not more than Trump.  There are a lot of selfish bastards in this country.
If trump talking bout forgiving student loans would y’all vote for him?
Thank God we have someone with the guts and fortitude to take on Trump! You have 100% of my support ftom Alabama!
Don't believe it. He is. Trump hates him.
Sorry. I assumed by your remarks you strongly dislike Trump and will be voting against him.
I bought a "trump 2020" stamp. Gave it to my son cuz I never use cash. I have no doubt that every piece of legal tender will have that on it. 😬😂
Trump is 10 years too late...👇 #ACA. #ObamaWasBetterAtEverything
Trump started out farther ahead in life than I did and maybe farther ahead than you too, but you still don’t build the organizations he has without being a strong leader.
I don’t understand the positives Trump voters saw in Donald Trump in 2016 that they refuse to support him this time around. I can’t believe it took a pandemic to change their attitude about this man.  Now reality has hit them and their families. We warned them.
Don’t fall for trump antics lol
Let me make this as clear as I can. If you follow Trump and his accomplices, you are not a patriot, you are a traitor, to the U.S. Constitution and to your country and your people.
Trump fans can only dish out insults, vulgarity and slander. That's all they have because that's all they have. There's nothing else in there.
Wouldn’t it be amazing if trump tweeted “please don’t believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they’re spreading false information on social media.”  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
Put Trump behind bars
Being a lady, I certainly have never passed gas. However, I shall think particularly foul smelling thoughts at trump.
But with all the scandals and the blind support of Trump, it's clear his priority is Jerry, not our University.  It's time for fresh leadership.  He's lucky his father isn't alive to see this.  Dr. Falwell may have been controversial, but he loved Jesus and loved LibertyU.
No, Trump's right. Nobody would do what he's done. Most leaders would never consider outright treason and pushing Nazi Fascism. It's just not done.
And for my final play for this week (this may be one of my last ever): They say stockcharts can predict the future. If true what we may see first of the week is some pressure when the Dems threaten to prevent Trump from his EOs given tonight. They then become the bad guy.(1/3)
Trump tells lies in much the same way the rest of us breath air.
I cannot wait for the HUGE NEWS in November! You trump people have nearly ruined this country.
I am working on getting my sister in Michigan registered to vote she has never voted before she is going to be voting for Trump in November #Trump2020
Bill Barr's going to have his own troubles to deal with the second daddy Trump is history. They're going to spit roast him like a fattened summer hog...You are on your own.
Idk, it sounds like you just want to blame him. I haven’t seen anything that would indicate Trump has caused people to die from Covid. I’m not trying to fight with you but I just think you might be biased.
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don’t want he has.
Baron Trump won't stop griefing me on our minecraft server send tweet
Democrats falling over themselves to come to his defense. Why does no one see he's just as shitty as Trump?  They're both garbage candidates.
I guess I'm going to have to remind everybody again...Trump is jack ass, a liar, a criminal and a traitor. Why do you continue to listen to anything he says?
Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures

Yes, I know it's bad that the only reason I watch President Trump's press conference just hear him say "China virus". However, I can't help myself.

Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
No matter which way you look, the rich just keep getting richer while Trump and McConnell are still in power. So ironic when you look at their supporters, all dirt poor and uneducated, voting against their own self interests in the name of racism.
Two things must happen after Trump is ousted. One, the tax exemption laws need to be purged in such a way as to disallow tax exemptions for anything remotely political. Two, we need massive new public works projects. Three...

This goes beyond just TikTok...
I figure since I make Fuck Trump bracelets that makes me a “critic” of President Peach:  So because I’m poor, went to a state school (still a top school in the country), and have only been to ten states and D.C., I’m not “cosmopolitan” and I’m ill-equipped to challenge him?
Problem is the vacuum we would cause and the relations that would be strained with locals. Like when Trump pulled from Syria left the Kurds to be slaughtered.
Here’s this picture of Ukrainian MP Andriy Derkach, and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani that I’m posting for absolutely no reason at all:
One of them namely being the Trump campaign
So you agree with TRUMP that children are immune...
Everything goes back to Trump and his GOP enablers and their lust for money and power. Everything they do, every lie that comes out of their mouths is spoken to keep Trump in power, no matter how degraded, no matter how low they have to crawl.
He regurgitates what Trump says.
Agree, it's better to assess the entire package of any candidate. If the bad greatly overwhelms the good, as I think it does for Trump, then don’t vote for him even if you can’t stand his opponent.
I have not heard this term but like it. “one-thingism.” I have referred to many evangelicals having a one trick pony mindset when supporting Trump just because he says he's against abortion and will pack the judicial system with conservative judges. They overlook his many ills.
Trump speaking in this way is why anyone with decency, integrity, compassion or a love of God would never support this bigot.
Did you have this energy for Trump when he was buying some WAP while he had a pregnant wife?
Me setting up a VPN to watch TikToks because Donald Trump said not to
The fact there are people who think 78 year old Biden won't be just as shitty a President as Trump is alarming.  This may be the worst choice since Trump and Hillary.

Not disagreeing with you on this but they’ve done a good job of that with the Muslim concentration camps all on their own. They don’t need Trump to make them look like evil assholes.
*which isn't even to say I support abortion!  Just not the crazies in that movement that de facto support Trump etc.
There was a small bump when report came out but hoping for bigger bump when trump.talks about the report today. And stimulus announcement could be next week q hopefully a job bonus.
(I'm not, of course. I'm practicing, in the sense that I go to mass and read about mostly Franciscan theology (and sometimes the Jesuits ❤️)- but I'm not going to anybody's mass for the genocide of unborn babies/Trump rally.
He's not my savior but President Trump is fighting for the future of this country and the world. This info you are spouting,  where is your proof? Do you honestly believe the media wouldn't have the paperwork posted EVERYWHERE if they actually had anything? THEY LIE! Wake up!
I mean, me too. Anecdotally the devout seem to eat up everything Trump says. At least as the "less two evils" 🙄But 🤷🏻‍♀️ Maybe I'm secretly in the company of a lot of sjw caths. Id like to know where bc the vocal ones get torn down as "not really"... smh.
Im with you Jenna 💯 nobody but Trump gets my vote this man has endured nonsense on top of nonsense for 4 years and he deserves a second term

Yes. This delay in announcing VP is causing yard signs, etc to not be printed &amp; distributed. And Trump 🤮 signs are going-up in my neighborhood. Here is a great yard-sign:
It’s very telling that I have not seen a single comment on here justifying Trump as a good leader. His supporters don’t seem interested in a good leader, just someone to buck the system, whatever that means to them.
Take this self assessment. You might be stage 5
Joe Biden, and his entire party, is supposed to be the opposition to Donald Trump. Watch this video, and then go watch Biden debate Paul Ryan. If you conclude that he's not experiencing significant cognitive decline, I don't know what to tell you.
"If you don't vote for me, you ain't black!" Imagine Donald Trump uttering those words. Face it, your boy Biden is a racist.

Imagine going so hard in the paint that you defend “Thighland” as the correct pronunciation instead of laughing it off 😂.  This is why people are so turned off by MAGA and it is insincere when Trump claims he’s joking because his supporters have no sense of humor.
What is being done to bring out Dem voters and save us from Trump? Many in N Huntsville not even registered. Trump is delay for people of color!
2/2. It’s true *Biden* may not be exciting enough to end that complacency (for now). But again I think Trump does plenty to energize voters against him.
Cool! Thanks for the vote. I might as well have been one of those stay at home voters last time. Voted 3rd Party (don’t worry I wasn’t in a swing state). What I would argue helps complacency is COVID and anger and frustration over Trump for 3.5 years. 1/2
If they have ANY integrity, EVERY "family values" repub should say the same! ......Except they voted for Trump.
So? Trump's made gaffes for 4 years. He's a grifter, con man, always angry, has no empathy, ruined friendships with allies, aligned with autocrats, &amp; he does NOT care about American lives... "it is what it is"!   I'll take  any day of the week.
I’m so excited he’s not Trump haha
Let’s put an end to the Party of Trump, f/k/a the Republican Party. Vote them all out of every office nationwide. 99% of Republican office holders seem to have forgotten what it once meant to be a member of that party. It can be done. Seen any Whigs running for office lately?
Sorry, to clarify: most people who voted for Trump voted to keep Clinton out and I’m not going down the rabbit hole of voter fraud with you because the loser always say the election was rigged. Will be the same this Nov.
Your comparing trump to hitler?! That may have come out of your mouth a little too fast and easy before thinking about it. Or you didn’t have history when you were in school.
Good point. I used the phrase figuratively, not literally. I think Biden is less competent to run a country than Trump, but I would have to give him the nod on getting in. But then again none of us earn a spot so I can’t speak on that.
COVID is a huge problem. But some folks, especially Trump and his GOP backers pretend that everything is fine. Trump literally just said it is what it is. The US is leading the world in cases and deaths. We as a nation clearly have a problem, but not according to some leadership

It doesn’t matter. Like Trump you can’t figure out that just because her ratings drop that doesn’t mean what she’s saying is not true. Check out ad hominem arguments. A logical fallacy that you have just presented an example of. You flunk debate.

She’s called him a predator, criminal, and small 😂. He has never responded to those attacks. I think Trump doesn’t respond well when someone is tougher than he is. He likes to belittle and shame those who he sees as weak.
Well he is an idiot. I believe he was looking at the mortality rate of infected people which is pretty good in the USA. Since Trump has botched the federal response he tries to take credit for the efforts of health care workers. What a putz.

Nowhere in the Mueller report did it say either of those two things, in fact it stated clearly that the campaign and the Russian government both sought to gain from each other, and that Trump wasn’t exonerated re: Obstruction.
So, the Twitter employee who took down Trump's tweet about children's extremely low susceptibility to covid19 disease was previously Kamala Harris's press secretary! Makes sense!
Mane 🤣🤣🤣🤣 they do not give a uff ufff about y’all! America does not care about its  middle class people 🤣 if you not a pro athlete, famous, or a politician America don’t care about you! Trump said it is what it is with people dying as long as he straight he cool 😂😂😂😂

My favorite is all the No-Maskers who started fawning over Trump once he started wearing one.  I hate people.
But..... I thought Trump was the racist one..
And idiots think TRUMP is the one leading us to fascism. Ironically, he is. Not in the way they think, though. Its their own party who is doing it because of TDS.
Have you been hiding under a rock for the past 3.5 years? Obama and the Dems have been investigating Trump since he announced he was running. Your TDS must be flaring up.
LoL. And yet Trump has to personally get involved in the convictions of his aides in order to keep them out of jail. Something is wrong with your brain.
Literally everything in the Mueller report, why you people act like that isn’t a damaging report in which the Trump campaign sought and even communicated with Russian intelligence as they were attacking our election is fucking beyond the realm of human intelligence.
Trump’s tool setting us up for election failure. Keep the pressure on,   Please.
What were we thinking? We were thinking that we didn't want more of Obama and one of the worst Presidential candidates in recent history to be in the White House. Thankfully, she lost. That's why Trump won.

Maybe her depression is fear of all the spying her husband did against Trump and his campaign! Prosecute Obama!
He can’t debate. He has no stance except that he’s a Trump puppet. Trump is going down. A puppet with no master is worthless.
A good friend of mine posted to his Facebook page.....  "Trump is a racist. If you support Trump, you're a racist"  With that logic, if you support Biden, you must support pedophilia   It's sad what has happened to the minds of so many bc of the MSM
Debates between Biden &amp; Trump are scheduled &amp; will happen.  They start when conventions make nominations official. Tuberville will never debate Jones because he has no platform and no policies to talk about. Being a Trump puppet is his only stance. Without Trump, he’s nothing.
And you have proof? No, you don't but guess what? There IS proof that Flynn lied to the FBI, there IS proof that Flynn ADMITTED his guilt, there IS proof that Flynn sat in on a call to Putin w/Trump! How about that!

Rudy needs Trump to win so Trump can finally dismantle the investigation by Rudy’s old department that just might send him to jail.
OMG, it was not a bioweapon. Spread hate, that will get you far. Look at your master, Trump.
Note Tuberville’s statement that Trump dropped his guard to make the spread worse. Tuberville’s denial of severity will make it worse. People aren’t dying and hospitals full because of more testing. Liar. Vote Doug Jones.
Trump should stop his incessant lying. It is the Pubs that can't agree on stimulus package. Not the Dems as Trump keeps saying.

I’m going to like Biden’s veep choice less than I like Pence, but the problem with the Trump-Pence ticket is not Pence. Likewise, people aren’t going to be voting for Biden because of who his VP will be. At best, the VP will reassure some voters.
I'm NOT voting for you. If you had developed a spine and looked out for the people of Georgia, instead of Trump, I would have voted for you. Im a Republican, but I'm voting against you.

Trump Campaign Wants Presidential Debate in Early September |   via

I wonder how long it'll take for Trump to blame the Democrats
Lol last time I checked they lied and the vote for impeachment was won just cause the majority was red bud. They have PLENTY to indict him. Corrupt system won’t allow it.
Trump is Crazy n his family needs to institutionalize him being president of the USA 🇺🇸 IS 2 Much power 4 him Don jr Eric Jared n Ivanka seem 2b True DJTRUMPS unless they end up n jail!!!!!
How many times has the trump administration violated the Hatch Act?  I've lost count.
No information that Russians are trying to help other candidates except Donald Trump . Sally Yates
he makes fun of Fox News and Trump supporters he's a parity account and a comedian it's all satire
so even us that do take it seriously should die Simply because we are American? that's a shitty thing to say considering the majority of Americans do take it seriously you're only seeing the crazy Trump supporters
Here's my deal: In my state, my vote doesn't really matter. Trump is almost certain to win my state. If Election Night is so bad that he doesn't, then he's already lost the Electoral College by losing the swing states.
What if we get stuck with trump for another 4 years.🤧
You must be drooling to get on with Trump , sorry your not his type , He likes young women
President Donald Trump said that he's considering delivering his Republican convention acceptance speech from the White House in a move that would mark an unprecedented use of public property for partisan political purposes.
Used to think trump might be the dumbest mother fucker ever... but nah it’s you dumbasses out here supporting him! Still ask myself how people could be so stupid though 🤦🏼‍♂️
HANNITY: Democrats Worried Biden Too Weak &amp; Feeble, Will be ‘Destroyed’ ...
It’s infuriating. The Trump crime family violates it for the millionth time yet no consequences. Just another day from a racist, narcissistic, pathological lying, mentally unstable sociopath. For God sakes, let there be justice served when this criminal is out of office.
And on a phone call from the oval office Putin gave Trump his specific orders to destroy the US.  We calling it even now?
Kids, teachers, that didn’t have a say so. I don’t want people to get sick. Anyway, I’m not arguing with you. I’m pretty sure your one of those trump people. GREAT! I don’t give a flying dogs ass who you vote for! I just want good health for everyone and trying to get through it!
Trump supporters tell it's a vote for Biden.
Your ability to support Trump while also feeling like you’re quoting Orwell unironically is a breathtaking feat of mental gymnastics
Actually, what you’re saying is partly what I meant in my original tweet. Our security depends upon adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, faith in government and institutions, and national unity. Trump has undermined all of these.
Trump himself 😂
Not quite he said popular vote would go to trump in 2016, which is just wrong.
Thank god  finally got some sense in them And started tying candidates to trump instead of doing the centrist bullshit that got them annihilated before.
BLM organization is led by marxist. I do not agree with trump on all. But the leaders are marxist. Look them up.
What's with this thing he does with his hands when he talks?. Sooo irritating to watch. And he sits like a woman with a huge butt. Why trump why? Eww..
Trump ACTIONS have “neutered” the CDC...left it highly ineffective when it comes to inspiring calm and reducing anxiety...destroying the public trust in the agency...it’s guidelines...it’s statistics. “If this is Trump approved...is it TRUTHFUL.” Thank God for Dr. Fauci.
Good morning Twitter family. Hope everyone is having a great day so far. Getting ready to do my cardio and then hit up the gym. We have 90 days remaining to vote out all of these Democrat clowns out of office. I know I will be voting for President Trump and all Republicans.
This dude is not there mentally. I can’t imagine him with world leaders and negotiating deals. They will make up some excuse for him not to debate President Trump and the media will cover for him.
Don't need to. He got Trump talking just let Trump be Trump.
Watch trump wins re-election and democrats blames it on voter fraud from their plan of mail-in voting. You heard it here first.
Ga nurses,... get ready! The kids are next! Trump/Kemp guinea pig trial! You were warned!

...But Trump has apparently agreed as well.
GREAT job, protecting the pecking order! I hope you made your trump god happy!
I seriously thought this was an Onion story.
Trump should adopt the Biden strategy. I was planning to vote third party but the more I hear Trump talk the closer I come to voting Biden as a matter of national security (by mail of course).
It’s interesting that, of all the famous people associated with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, only one is extending his best wishes to Maxwell.  Not saying it implies guilt but it is... interesting.

the sexual assault allegations haven't been proven false and are in fact still going on with multiple witnesses.  where are you getting your information?   the vet was gassed and beaten.  see the thing you don't realize you're doing is making excuses for everything trump does....
portland.  those vets weren't even for blm.  they weren't even chanting it, they just didn't like the secret military taking people's rights.   trump ignores the important issues and acts like a child... do you really think he handled the covid situation correctly?
grow up and move on.   i swear you cult members need to do your own research and stop depending on the words of others.  when i did my research, i learned a lot like never to be for trump again
do your research. trump is refusing to submit his dna
what's trump's excuse?  i'm appalled at how many women are supporting a man that's been accused of rape by multiple women.  it makes absolutely no sense
i mean biden does have 24 women claiming he raped them and plus refuse to give his dna, biden also was fined twice for refusing to rent to minorities, plus biden has locked up hundreds of hispanics in cages like animals ...oh nm... that was trump
yes but at least he's not an evil lying rapist so if he gets elected, he can have his bouts of memory lapses as long as he don't act like trump
message me...lol.. i'll argue for awhile then i'll block them when they get on my nerves too bad.  realize you can't win with them, they are cult members.  they worship trump
Except that Trump had provided the highest employment for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in HISTORY with the highest employment of women in over 70 years.  has admitted he WILL RAISE your taxes, take your guns, fund others to your detriment, crazy funding of green energy
Make no mistake  contributed to this by not replenishing PPE fro H1N1 debacle,having US relying on #China and   partially funding China virus research.  ignores that Trump provided highest employment in HISTORY for blacks, Hispanics &amp; Asians
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment

sure you don't.  just like trump isn't a racist, he just says and does racist things... gtfoh
Lol that’s funny, I guess that’s why doctors and nurses are dropping dead all over the country right? Because they have to wear a mask up to 12 hours a day. Lol trump bull chit
so you think flooding the comment section with childish memes is going to distract me away from the murderous, treasonous racist rapist we have in office??? interesting
so trump saying blm is a terrorist group but doesn't condemn the kkk makes him a what??//
naw, we are not that diverse when it comes to what we want.  i say about 80 percent of us want trump out.   and the latino communities has people from mexico to puerto rico.  a lot of different countries so a lot more diversity
we aren't as diverse as latinos.  look let's not pretend biden is the best choice, he's the only choice though.  trump would see us all locked up in chains or lynched.  but when you go to a black community, it's mostly black americans. when you go to a latin community, there ....

trump and ⁦ republicans screwed our country and our people, if they had responded the right way 3,300 would have died instead of 158,000. What a complete shitshow this has been. They will meet their maker one day &amp; have to explain
um you're not too bright are you.  did you ignore the part about research?  stop believing everything trump tells you and do your research.  i mean really?  you want to talk about educated decision and yet you follow a man who cheated on his s.a.t. test...lmfao. come on. stop it
how old are you, twelve?  check my likes?  um research how trump has killed over 180,000 people.  you may learn something. also research the 24 women who said he sexually assaulted them and you do know he's refusing to give a dna sample right?
child, if biden sat in a corner rocking back and forward, he would still be better than trump and would have my vote
the crazy part about it, trump stands for most things God is against, the prideful, self lover, liar, he has the blood of 180,000 people on his hands, adulterer, the list goes on and on
So basically stating the truth, in just. All the Hollywood pedophiles hate Trump because Hillary loves the kids too. Totally funny joke tho. Probably not gonna age well

I thought Trump had to have a great PR person. That is until this guy ran for president.
How much did the NRA give to the Trump Campaign in 2016? More than any other candidate ever
ah that's so true.  i forgot they just repeat everything trump says because of course trump is never wrong.. i can't understand why they worship a man who lies to them repeatedly, starts a war in his own country and has killed over 180,000 people
exactly.   they believe we're dumb enough to fall for it.  i would vote for a fly before i'd vote for him or trump.  this country wouldn't be able to stand 4 more years of mess
Nonsense. He said it was “inappropriate to have to wait a week” for the results. One state had to wait 6 weeks for their election results. Don’t you even listen to or read what you post — or is it all just anti Trump spin for uneducated liberals?
The “norms” of office are what got us in the mess America is in right now!!! Thanks to the last 3 presidents! As a CONCERNED AMERICAN, President Trump is fighting hard to put America back into the hands of the American people, WHERE IT BELONGS!
Deceit by the Trump campaign
Exactly experts decide and spread the truth while  is killing our families and our kids, why don’t he send his son to school, have these margays ask that ??? Yet. No; Barren Trump is doing VIRTUAL LEARNING AT HIS SCHOOL THIS YEAR
wasn't donald trump it was the "team trump " account which is part of his crew.  they just updated it.  it's still funny as crap though.
i'm shocked that a woman would even consider voting for trump considering he has 24 alleged sexual assault allegations against him one being 13 at the time.  interesting that they want to arrest obama though..lol
trump's whole team seem really immature.  maybe trump should be somewhere in a basement watching instead of having covid spreader rallies.
He called that 110%, at least trump knows who he is, that’s all he knows.  he’s about the stupidest dumbas* I’ve ever heard speak. Just goes to show money can buy a lot of things but smarts is not 1 of them.
on Trump team Russia collusion:  It happened (it didn’t)  I have proof (Schiff lied - he did not)  Trump is Putin’s puppet ( Trump sent lethal weapons to Syria to combat Russians while Schiff &amp; Obama sent blankets 😂)  Nothing  says can be believed.

but they don't get it.  these vets weren't out there because they supported blm, they were out there because the rights that they fought for was being violated. they weren't even chanting blm. those vets are brave strong men that came out to show they weren't have trump's bs.
here we go again, trump filled it, what;s your point
lol you were race baiting. i talked about trump and as typical, you throw up obama...lol... so stop deflecting
so here we go blaming obama again when trump was the one that ordered them thrown in there.  i swear ya'll worship that man. it's ridiculous. obama been gone, the next hurricane is obama's fault also
if you have the money to afford a place in trump towers, you'd have trouble getting in.  he was fined twice for not renting to minorities
you should be asking what he's going to do for the country in general to bridge the gap that trump has created.  we need to get covid under control, then he needs to speak to the people to unite them, so stop being selfish and go vote for the idiot in office but remember this...
so biden is demented and trump is mentally stable??  um... i think both have some dementia but trump is just pure evil with his.
another fool who thinks pouring gasoline on a fire is the way to extinguish it.  how much is trump paying you to be his personal ball sack
Donald Trump.. not a big national park guy eh?
President Donald Trump said Monday he had fired Tennessee Valley Authority chairman and Decatur resident Skip Thompson, criticizing the federally owned corporation for hiring foreign workers and overpaying its chief executive officer.
no you allow trump to dictate how you think and feel. a true leader does not throw gasoline on a fire to try and extinguish it. what amazes me is all of the racist views coming at black american but then the sames ones with the racist views say "but i'm not a racist"
Falling off the Trump Train as Trump fires and destroys another good person by firing the wrong TVA person because he can’t get at the CEO. What a rotten pattern.
To each there own, but isn’t it cringe how hardcore trump supporters really believe “God” only loves America?
An insecure narcissistic control freak, AKA Donald Trump?!!
Because Trump is afraid that if everyone gets to vote safely, he’ll lose their election?
That’s what we need for everyone to be part of the decision! Trump wants those most often disenfranchised to have great difficulty voting, as they’re most likely not to vote for him!
Never even saw the targeted to  survey. But Dr Fauci hasn’t seen a patient in over 20 years &amp; he’s simply an unelected Gov employee. Trump is advised by many - not just left leaning Dr Fauci.
Too late Michael. Everyone knows the latest Trump interview is out there, and they are waiting to see what you were prompting him to say!! 🤫🤫🤫
here we go again.  dang you deflected about trump and went on a rant about blm.  then you brought up that one of the officers was black.  then someone else reminded you that the officer that killed mr. george floyd was white,
no you pulled out the race card when you started about blm...lol deflect then try to flip it...lmfao.  does it matter what race the police are if they're doing their job correctly? typical trump playbook.  keep trying.
the problem is, he has no point.  he is just deflecting from the facts that trump is a complete failure. trump does the same thing, we you call him on his iss, he starts rambling about blm or china.  trump and #Cult45 can't stick the facts
Not true, trump hired his own people to investigate voter fraud, his own people found found 3 instances of voter fraud in the last 20 years.
still waiting on your relevant point.  the typical deflecting racist.  let's not focus on the real issues, let's focus on blm...lol hey but let's ignore the 150,000 lives lost and putin's bounty on our military.  let's ignore the numerous times trump has been caught in lies......
killed by racist police officers.  let's not focus om the 150,000 dead because of trump's negligence, when it's brought up let's just talk about blm... just like sheep led to the slaughter. he told ya'll no mask and you believed him
you aren't too smart are you?  you worship trump and his racist actions.  you think it's ok to kill a man just because he has a criminal record. that's the whole #cult45 mentality.  let's ignore the wrong trump and his minions do but focus on black people tired of being.....
yes, the trump rallies, trump encouraging people not to wear mask because it was a symbol against him, yes large magnitude because ya'll can't think for yourselves. you believe every single thing he says.  the blm movement, we can think for ourselves and speak out when we....

if you were to ask trump himself wtf he was talking about, HE wouldn't even know.  how can they let him finish out his term?  he clearly isn't mentally stable
trump wants people to donate "plausma"  lol.. what an idiot #WomenAgainstTrump #EndTheNightmare #TrumpVirus
maybe you should think for yourself and stop letting trump tell you what to think.  if you think protesting police brutality is terroristic  then you seriously are a racist
President Donald Trump said today that he had fired the chair of the Tennessee Valley Authority, claiming the federal agency has betrayed American workers.
yeah but trump did things worth suing over
Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton’s ex-WH spokesman says
and let's keep the man free who's negligence has led to over 150,000 people's deaths.  trump is the most prolific serial killer in the united states
and i'm not a big fan of joe biden but would vote for a shoe box before i'd vote for trump
#Cult45  can't think for themselves.  they have to agree with EVERYTHING trump says and does.   they are even willing to sacrifice their own kids and lives for him.  trump exhibits signs of mental instability daily. trump is everything that's wrong with the country  now
After what these jackasses did to Yovonavich, Hill &amp; Vindman &amp; his brother give them any job they want. Sondland, Grenell, Dejoy, Perry, Mulvaney, &amp; all these others who paid trump to put them in rolls in his swamp move them to Siberia. They w/ love Putin since they no gd to him
Nope. Truth has been their downfall long before Trump.
like you would know who God is!!! you follow a racist tyrant.  those the video is vulgar, i think it isn't any worse than you worshipping a racist troll named trump!!! now that's horrible and disrespectful!!!!!
everyone should have voted for Deez Nuts instead of trump, at least it would have been slightly amusing.  trump is murderous
Our teachers are so underrated. People still don't understand the value of their job to teach the next generation, and the next, and so on. Without teachers we will surely become the Idiocracy that Trump wants us to be.
I know Trump didn't say that, because it's the truth.
oh biden is worse?? um trump was fined 2 times for not renting to minorities, and he was told about the bounties on multiple occasions, he just was too busy golfing
are you forgetting epstein and trump wishing her well?  you #Cult45  don't even use the slightest bit of common sense to see what's really going on
claimed Loomer &amp; others created the false flag about bombers  being Trump supporters - then “hashtag "#MAGABomber" began trending on Twitter, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, "MAGA" (Make America Great Again).[114][115][116]” sounds like Loomer was right
the problem is they hadn't guzzled the right amount of kool-aid.   they believe every single thing trump says and does is absolutely correct. they worship him. they would sacrifice their children to him
and here comes the trump cult members...lmfao...
Also Trump did not know the bank had been so throughly robbed, that  so ineptly handeled the situation, &amp; many other things were broken when Trump began office requiring attention.
Nope wrong again:
Well said. We all know, the lesser of two evils but that pretty much qualifies 99 percent of all human beings as the lesser evil. Compared to Trump one would really have to be a true monster to be worse.
Odd how  had almost 50 years (8 as a VP) to root out “systemic racism”  and did NOTHING. Yet  claims  as a racist when Trump DID SOMETHING in 3 years, making the highest employment for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in HISTORY!

glad your eyes are now open because i always think anybody that fights or have fought for us are number 1.  i respect vets so much but gained more respect if that's possible to the vets who may not be for blm but stood in protest with them against trump's war on civilians.

talk about window licker.  if trump had of shut the country down in the beginning for about a month, this would have been just a bad memory. due to his lack of response, we are still suffering with covid. trump just isn't too bright
I think it’d be the other way around! Trump doesn’t have the courage to have a good debate.

Why won’t I vote for Trump? Crap like this is why. There ain’t enough judges in the world to make up for the damage he’s done to the Church’s witness in this country.  # via
None of that is putting the country first. None of that is good for our nation. Some of you clowns used to believe that before 2017. Some of y’all have forgotten that the reason why Trump is such a cancer is that he is a creation of Democrat politics in New York.

Trump Criticizes Late Rep. John Lewis For Not Attending Inauguration
Dude have you seen trump speak
Trump attacks fox when they criticize him which is insane
Joe will not be debating Trump. That’s for certain. What is to figure out is what excuse he will use. Virus, too close to Nov 3 and some voting is already done, comes down sick, won’t agree on moderator. What’s your guess?
Plus, by avoiding prosecution in another country, he can still continue to sow discord and reap whatever financial benefits he can from what remains of his business.  Trump isn't running for President.  He's running to avoid prison.
It sounds fantastic.  I know.    But, there's nothing left for Trump in America except for countless lawsuits.  If he stays in America, he'll spend the rest of his life in court fighting to avoid prison.  If he's convicted of anything, he'll likely die in prison.
The pilot would have to comply since Trump would still be Commander In Chief.    From that airport, Trump can take ground transportation to wherever he's arranged for asylum.  Moscow wouldn't be out of the question.
I think it's more likely that Trump is a flight risk.    If he loses, all he needs to do is schedule a meeting in Europe.  At some point in the journey, he changes the itinerary and orders AF1 to set down at a different location.  1/x
Reich is wrong, though.  Pence can't pardon Trump of crimes he hasn't been tried for or prosecuted of.  That's not going to happen between Election Day and Inauguration.
This is a bad take.  A.  Trump would have to be found guilty of a federal crime before he could be pardoned of it.  That won't happen between now and inauguration.  B.  Even then, Pence would only be able to pardon Trump of federal crimes; not state-level.
Democratic requests to vote by mail have surged in Florida, a state that Trump almost certainly must win to secure a second term. Election security experts say voter fraud is rare in all forms of balloting, including by mail. &gt;&gt;
Is anyone else seeing how Trump is throwing democrats a load of BS everyday and they haven't figured it out yet. Blinded by their own BS.
I agree with Trump &amp; COVID in children being less harmful to majority.  My 16 year old Granddaughter had it late Spring.  She only had slight fever for 2 days.  Other than that She had NO other symptoms!
Trump is right! First debate should be moved up to a date that’s prior to first State voting.  The date now is almost a month before the first Debate.

See how politicians and advocacy groups reacted in posts and videos as President Donald Trump signed legislation to spend nearly $3 billion a year on conservation, outdoor recreation, national parks and other public lands.
(Also worth mentioning that this graphic isn't even accurate.)  But that's par for the course:  when do we expect Trump or Trump supporters to care about truth and accuracy?

See and that's exactly where we differ in opinion. I do not believe that Biden is even a little better than Trump.  And I refuse to vote the lesser of two evils. If the Democratic party wants my vote they need to run a candidate I believe in.
And I get it you're willing to vote for Biden because you believe that there is some legitimate difference between him and Trump. I don't. Deal with it.
I don't vote against candidates I vote for candidates. So instead of trying to explain to me why I need to vote against Trump explain to me why I should vote for Biden without mentioning Trump.
Sorry but if your best argument for Biden is "but Trump" you're engaging in a futile effort with me. I don't negotiate with terrorists.
Literally every reason I won't support Trump are the same reasons I won't support biden. And telling me I have to support Biden is like someone trying to convince you you have to support Trump. It's a total waste of time.
I don't know why you keep attacking Trump it's safe to say that all of us hate Trump.

Police have released few details about the killing, including any motive. &gt;&gt;
The original reply was because you said “it’s all about Trump” correct? It’s just a response to what you stated. The kneeling had been going on before Trump. But you blame him. The coronavirus started in China. But you blame him. He is not perfect, but you are ridiculous

Because he’s not Trump. These people are called NonTrumpers.  They will vote for Biden knowing full well ha isn’t gonna do shit for em. They just wanna vote against Trump. Pay higher taxes, get a free abortion, pay for illegals, oh and have people like me pay your loans
I say stick it in China's eye.  Build a new Trump Tower there and base some warships there.  I think Nixon was an idiot for agreeing to the “One China” policy.
In the 2016 primaries his people caught Jeb Bush's people flat footed...his domain expired so  's team picked it up and had it redirect to Trump's page. Shrewd and hilarious!
What do flat earthers, anti vaxers, anti maskers, racist, CAD (christians against dinosaurs) and trump supporters have in common.... Their idiots and a lot of them are the same person. You're the problem
Trump maybe looking for land to build more golf courses nationwide chain of Trump Country clubs with low wage immigrant grounds keepers . Uge profits to be made .
No I’m saying he actively made it worse with his incompetence and malignant narcissism. Obama made a CDC office in Bei Jing specifically to keep an eye on China and trump got rid of it. He just now decided to actually push wearing masks. Bc he’s a child

If you dont want to be chased by men with guns whether its civillians or cops i have a fantastic idea for you... Stop breaking the fucking law. And also trump doesnt need to be moral as the government is not a moral institutionand if he is such a clown hows he doing so great
Arbery was casing houses to steal from he was chased and citizens attempted to detain him he then charged a man and grabbed his shotgun.... What exactly do you think he was gonna do if he got that gun and trump is an amazing president hes not a hero hes a great leader
Interesting. So.. what about those bounties?? Even IF Trump didn’t know anything about it (he did), why hasn’t he still done anything about it?
Brianna taylor was wrong and the cops should be charged however arbery was a justified shooting hence why the media went quiet on it there was no way to spin it and trump doesnt cause stress hes done a better job then most who ever held that office
Trump would finally get the [real] crowd size he wants

Omg all I have to do to be successful is to start a business and say how great trump is biiiiiitch...

He offends me deeply too!  I love my country and all the people in it. Think of all the people who would still be alive right this very moment if Trump had used his brain, or allowed someone else with a brain to lead us into this virus war.Aww. Today's poll showed Trump over Biden by 3. 🐘💯

Another example if how dumb Trump is.  He just says whatever comes out of his mouth regarding how stupid it sounds.
I think he pretty much got the job because he will lie. He will also hire a hooker and not pay child support which makes he super qualified for the Trump administration.

Trump cursed black athletes. He bashes black politicians and residents on their Districts. He bashes predominantly black cities. He has been sued for housing discrimination. Now he's terrifying white suburbanites that low income minorities will destroy their communities.
I fully agree, but again, my hope is that its prevalence &amp; pervasiveness aren’t so deeply-rooted that it literally forces this nation into a second trump term. I’m not sure how systemic the issue is within the party, but it better not fuck this up. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

HAPPENING NOW:  President Trump holds a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey
Congress needs to use the 25th amendment and remove Trump from office. If the republicans hope to win any elections in November 2020, removing Trump from office might be their only hope to try to turn the tide. Otherwise, it’s over for the republicans.
We will never know.   said his glass as full of “Black water” not wine. And both he and that young ladies pants were unzipped because they didn’t fit.  No one ask why their pants were off, just accepted the excuse.  media lets Trump get away with lies, not you
more Fuck’n lying!! Ur a lying liberal MF’er.. Trump lives in ur little pee brain rent free 🤡
STFU.. if ur mouth is moving ur lying 🤥 Trump is going to beat #BeijingBiden like a drum!!
Trump managed to fuck up THE POST OFFICE.
The FDA will be required to develop a list of essential medicines covered under the order. At a minimum, the order will apply to drugs and supplies needed to combat emergencies such as pandemics, bioterror attacks and other threats. |
They are calling out your lies and deceit. You people lack any morals or integrity. You have sold your souls to devil trump.
Press corps.  Please walk out on this “press conference” where trump has assembled members to be a cheering section.  No masks.  No distancing.  Please.  Don’t give him the audience in the press he craves.
Franklin Graham is somewhere scared to death now. Graham along with several other "so-called" evangelicals committed blasphemy and had the audacity to say that God sent Trump. Absolutely disgusting!!
LIVE NOW: President Trump holds a briefing.
Let trump be trump.   Look we’re that has landed us🤯
I don't watch cable news but I do know that with the asset forfeitures from Manafort that Mueller turned a profit and that he explicitly did not exonerate Trump and that he cited multiple instances of obstruction of justice.
Trump is no AntiChrist, Trump is a con-artist and his followers are fools.
“Step back and remember the big picture. What were Obama &amp; Co. so *desperate* to keep hidden if Trump won the election?”
Sir, you have my support.  But Stuart Stevens has a great idea.  You need a commercial that simply says, “Donal Trump has failed as President.  And his actions and lack of actions is costing you the lives of your loved ones and those you know “.
Steven Stevens just summed up this presidential race.  Donald Trump has failed as President and it costing you the lives of your loved ones and people you know.   It’s just that simple.  And that needs to be said over and over and over, everyday!
Hold on a minute what about Clinton and Obama??? They are secular and made millions off of Wall Street handouts. Reagan, Bush, and Trump may have pandered to the Christian Right to get elected but what did any of them actually do that actually benefitted the Christian Right???
Yeah, I’ve had journalists post more deranged ones. I get the same vibe from the way they do the Trump ads I see everywhere. Almost all of them are not designed to actually try to convince anyone to vote for him!
Trump is trying to take credit for anything that is going on positive N this country whether he is remotely close to it or not so he can try 2 get his base hyped up. We can't give this P.O.S credit 4 anything cuz he HATES people he's a Nazi. Nazis don't belong in our country.
Another follow.  I’m in 🤪
I hear you... as I mentioned two heads of the same snake. I wasn’t trying to diminish what Trump has done. I just can’t fathom why Biden is the democratic choice. We’ve got to find better people to run.
Pathetic,  I can hardly wait to hear you join in n the communal howl at the sky when president Trump is easily reelected. Btw, gfy you Russian dupe!
Few people may "Bible Trump" and "Profess the Military" but other than the military part it has no true affect on our political system. The Christian Right has lost every battle they've gotten in since the 1960s and America has since declined into a Post-Christian secular state.
I like how you’re trying to deflect to yet another lie but my question remains, would you have been ok with him not being caught? I’d guess if he was caught later on you’d blame Obama for not warning trump. Am I wrong?
Underfunding the Post Office is part of Trump’s campaign strategy.
You might explore the records before you call someone more of a criminal than Trump.  Abundance of evidence to the contrary. You seem to be stuck in your own fortified cave with your blinders on.  Go ahead cuss at me some more that will prove your point.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
I haven’t forgotten this: “Evangelical Jerry Falwell Jr. to head Trump education task force” l Reuters
I followed you. Any road that Trumpty Dumpty is on leads to Putin and his communist russian mafia gangsters. But the Chinese and the Iranians hate Trump. They may actually try to help Trump lose and help Biden win.  Any way that Trump loses works for me.
I would be interested in seeing Congress take the opportunity to consult the American people on proposed legislation, pass a law with a veto-proof majority, and then give Trump the job of enforcing it, instead of "negotiating" with Steven Mnuchin.
American has had Pandemics before, World Wars before, Stock Market Crashes before.  Historically speaking, this is not new.  What America has not had is  ,  Trump is new and the results are disastrous.  This is textbook - "FAILED LEADERSHIP"
He thinks Trump is going to come to his rescue.  Hopefully the board of trustees do the right thing though I could reslly care less. MY CONSCIENCE: Then why are you tweeting about this.  Take a nap Willie .
This is unfortunately all too true. Opinion | We are only beginning to suffer the consequences of Trump’s failures - The Washington Post
The freaking trump and the republican negotiators playing politics with the American people. Lies, lies and more lies every day.
This is an incredible simplification of Trump voters. Generalizations like this are not helpful and in a world which desperately needs reconciliation I’m surprised at this post. Some people vote on policies not personality. Trump voters aren’t monolithic!
It is not weird. It is selective editing to make it seem like Trump has failed, not that the virus has hurt every race. It is what Democrats do to win. Trump can bring jobs back. They don’t want the blacks to think that.
Reverend reveals what evangelicals say privately about Trump  via
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you’re a Biden supporter ?
DemonKKKrat strategy.  Open all schools across nation - Per Pres. Trump’s recommendation - see a tic up in cases (real or created) mid-October and shut schools down, messing up parents jobs, creating another crisis, blame President Trump.  It won’t work!
It's election season and Dipshitdonnie is losing.  He lost the #Vets4Trump and he is allowing Pompeo to make meaningless public statements that Trump himself can deny and ignore.  Only a moron would believe Trump would ever stand up to Putin.   Never has / Never will
Have you listen to trump trying to read what’s put in front of him? I submit Thighland and Yo See MITE from his recent attempts just this week. What day ye?
If anyone ask, "Where are all the NEW Manufacturing jobs  promised with his Tax give away for the rich and his Failed Trade-war?" They're in China and Vietnam, exactly where they always were.  Trump didn't bring them back, they just moved around within Asia.
The fact that Trump still has voters simply shows us how broken we are as a nation. A lot of Americans embrace racism, exploitation of the poor and the marginalization of LGBTQ+ persons. They seem to have zero empathy.
Trump really cares more about tiktok than Covid hahaha what world do we live in ?!
I think the real reason why Trump wants to take Tic-Toc down is because intelligence data shows China  election interference is anti-Trump. Russia’s is on Trumps side so putting bounties on US soldiers is OK with him.
Herman Cain, the former Republican presidential candidate, businessman and close ally of President Donald Trump, was guided by his Christian faith in politics, business and his personal life, his pastor said at his funeral Friday.
Yes, If I’ve learned anything from Twitter it is that you can’t use facts, truth and logic on Trump supporters.  Doesn’t work.  If it did, they would’nt be dining  on meals of Tucker Carlson and flirting with “Q”.  But if you have swamp land to sell, you may find a buyer there.
Trump uses God exactly as he uses people. As a pawn and a ploy. Trump is un-Christian based on his statements and behavior.
It’s going to be a landslide. I’m 63 voting for the first time. I believe there are many more like me. Dems will hold their nose and vote their pocket book (Trump) or sit it out.
#Biden shouldn’t have agreed to debates until #trump released tax returns
Republicans: SEE CHINA AND IRAN BACK BIDEN!!!! SOCIALIST  Democrats: SEE RUSSIA WANTS TRUMP TO WIN!!!! COLLUSION  The rest of us: 😑  The two party system failed us. How about we just do the right thing and secure our elections from all foreign nations?
On the short term, orange man bad vote blue is probably the only strategy toward anything resembling progressive policy. It's too late in the game to risk 4 more years of Trump. I want a student loan plan and healthcare too. Trump will mean neither. Biden might mean some.
Trump is the best president
The truth behind this is really questionable. First Trump says it was a hoax, then as pressure mounts for weeks, Pompeo says he warned Russia about it, but this is just now being disclosed. Can we see a transcript of the call or have some verification by those who listened in?
Mercy. I'm having the same thoughts I did about this time in 2016 when it was Clinton vs. Trump. I always try to be an optimist, but the choices in November have me using this emoji quite often &gt;&gt;🤦‍♂️
T-Roy ( John Legend Says Kanye West Is Helping Trump Get Re-Elected

this is going to get interesting; y’all know damn well trump isn’t going to do a single thing about this. I mean, since American elections are no longer American, I’m hoping the Chinese are better influencers and persuaders than the Kremlin, I guess
*With GOP Hubby Andrea Mitchell(  ) with her focus on Clinton EMAILS Everyday(EVERYDAY) helping Elect Trump- She would do less Damage if she were on FOX News
These assurances come from a totally unqualified, inexperienced Trump sycophant, a donor who was repaid with a government appointment. We can only hope that he is not just another Republican trying to undermine the voting process, but he clearly takes his orders from Trump.
Except when putin wants to kill Americans - Putin First The trump klan are all cowards. The only reason their ancestor immigrated here was to get out of military service in Germany.  Cowardice is in their DNA
No stimulus checks, unemployment boost? Last-ditch virus aid talks as Trump team back to Capitol
Meanwhile, Trump interviews himself for social media. 😂😂😂
"If Trump gets re-elected, the COVID lockdowns will last forever."  Essentially the argument.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.

You have no back to back up your claims. In fact you’re spreading misinformation. Tree I think Twitter and Facebook does not allow that. Maybe better clean up your act and get your facts straight. Donald Trump is beating you at your own game.
The poor guy can't stop himself from projecting.   If we promised Trump $1million in cash, 2 barely legal Russian mail order brides, and bag of Big-Macs if he goes 1 week w/out projecting, he'd lose every time. He can't help himself.
Trump claims Biden 'no longer worthy of the Black Vote' in wake of diversity comment
What the hell?? Everyone of us in health care and directly involved with Covid-19 efforts known Donald Trump POLITICALIZED this pandemic. EVERYBODY!!  Don’t start pulling this lying game with America! It’s YOU. Not Democrats or Republicans. YOU!!
Trump literally redirected data from the CDC, so you could say that the US has stopped “telling the truth” too

Hey  I'm just curious, can you name ANY hotels that are built w/o money from oligarchs? Lol, course not. Perhaps we should try Trump for his actual crimes instead of trying to blame Russians for our own criminal cabals?
Nope...it is the underlying condition of being a leader is that you are responsible for the decisions you make and how it affects others or the situation.  Trump can deny responsibility all he wants, but the fact is:  the buck stops there!!

I'm holding out hope that McGahn is one of the good ones however few and far between they might be. I seem to remember he had some disagreement with Trump about how being WH counsel isn't the same as being Trump's lawyer.
Are you implying that Donald J. Trump’s administration has managed the COVID-19 response better than Andrew Cuomo’s administration? Please provide evidence to you your claims. Joe Biden’s commercial tells the story of elderly Floridians who are not able to see their grandkids.
Do you want vote by mail so you can corrupt the election. If you think about health or anything else it’s about your grab for power. Also you didn’t like When you were ask a real question by PBS. She is not a Trump advocate. You just got caught in a lie. Out the door with you

My dad didn’t want to put on his mask and I was like “okay trump” and it was a good joke my whole fam laughed
Holy shit.  I wonder if Trump talked him into the hairstyle while playing golf with him a few weeks ago.
Besides Donald Trump, how about Vladimir Putin and his henchmen, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, and the republicans in the senate who kiss Putin’s ass seven times a day facing towards the kremlin. And don’t forget the head asskisser, Mike Pence.
GOP’s Senators opposition to a relief package is pretty clear sign they expect Trump to lose. If they thought he had a chance they would be signing on to a bigger package. This seems to be about setting the stage to oppose Biden.
TikTok is threatening legal action over President Trump's exectuive order to ban the Chinese social media app from doing business in the U.S. -
Yes, this is common sense, but what is also common sense is that Trump is American with an American accent. Americans dont pronounce Thailand this way. Dinesh is also trying to say most of the English speaking countries do. It appears people from most of those countries disagree.
Parents need to speak out.....and this right here is why Trump needs to go.  Fascism in the WH of the United States of America.....
It just gets uglier and uglier. If Joe would just smile at the camera and be quiet, his resume and Trump's craziness could help him win. Instead, it's feeling more and more like we just need a reset button. Our (Democrats) hope lies in the VP choice I'm afraid
Trump should be strapped with term #PandemicBotchery
Say what you want about Trump in that photo but man that kid does not know how to cut grass.
I still rubs me wrong knowing that Richard Nixon's signature is on my discharge documents. I can't even imagine how badly the current military folks feel knowing that they want to live with Trump's on theirs!
Trump has lots of rough edges. He’s far from the ideal man.Same as me. But he beats, by far, anything or anybody the left has to offer.

you never see the headline "Trump clarifies remarks".
a PULLBACK from the gains of May and June and evidence that the resurgent coronavirus IS SLOWING HIRING and the economic rebound.   Trump say "By the end of Summer American will be back Stronger than ever".   TicToc
Trump really bout to ban an app😭 WHOSE MANS IS THIS???
Trump supporters are the goddamn worst!
Oh and the navy ship actually had a big ceremony requested by Trump before it left for NY. So yeah.. fanfare.
Surpassing Expectations?  Who's expectations.  Not  's.  Trump said we would have a FULL Recovery by the end of Summer and be back even BIGGER than before by Fall.
As I recall, Fauci, CDC and WHO didn’t want a run on existing N95s which were in short supply globally. Also, I recall Fauci recommending a face covering and Trump said he would not be wearing one. On live TV.
will someone send me that child rape lawsuit against trump i am so pissed  my mother rn
If you don't feel compelled to vote at all this year, or if your morals compel you to write in a third party as a means of saving face, just stay home. Or better yet, just go ahead and cast your vote in for Trump. All of these choices might as well be the same fucking thing.
71% of people who voted for Trump do not have college degrees.
But you’re good with Biden saying “You ain’t black if you vote for Trump”? What a hypocrite
Bless your heart you’re getting the candidates confused. Biden was the one who said “You ain’t Black if you vote for Trump”
We are living in Idiocracy and Trump is President Camacho.
Pay close attention to what networks host the presidential debates.   We are going to see moderator interference like never before with Joe Biden at the podium against Trump.   Every time Joe stumbles or stutters they will jump in and finish his sentences.   #Debate2020 #Trump
Basically “Trump’s a dumb old man? What do y’all want?!?”
Whichever prison Trump ends up in should have a 24 hour live stream from his cell that people can subscribe to who want to watch him suffer and all the proceeds should go to #BLM.
Samuel P. Huntington's pet transition countries--Hungary &amp; Poland--are revealing exactly why they were his favorite. Please don't forget how Huntington's Harvard tenure paved the ideological space for Trump and white nationalism.
So, racism doesn't exist. Trump has never done anything wrong, doesn't lie, hasn't committed fraud (despite losing fraud cases), isn't racist (despite saying &amp; doing racist things). Right. I'm the one who's full of shit. Right.
i dont think being transgender should influence hether or not ur allowed in the military. blaire tries to justify it saying trump probably banned them because dysphoria could get in the way, but honestly i think trump banned it out of pure transphobia.
Trump is not the dictator of America.
LOL. Still not a liberal. I never said every white is racist. But, pretending that racism doesn't exist is as much fantasy as pretending Trump has never done anything wrong &amp; its all fake news &amp; conspiracy against him. Donald Christ is here to save us but I'm too dumb to see it?
trump, it’s the banning tiktok for me
Quit living in a fantasy. Black doctors, lawyers, etc. aren't bc racism is gone from society. Your argument is that no president has done more for minorities. It's not true. The only person who would say it is would be Trump himself.
You seem to not be reading my responses. I don't support Biden. I don't like him. But, disliking Biden is not a reason to excuse the faults, etc. of Trump.
hello donald trump yes i live in america not a communist country please don’t take my tiktok away this is a free country
Did what things? Fed. Govt has a spending problem. That has been ignored by every president including Trump. That's why tax money is going to other countries - BC WE OWE TRILLIONS. It's all Dems? By my count, we've had 2 Dem POTUS &amp; 4 GOP POTUS in the last 40 years.
All pols are vile liars, ALL! But Trump is truly a special kind of vile &amp; stupid. It's hard to believe such an ignorant child could exist in a 74 year old body. But capitalism excels at creating vapid, ignorant, selfishish tools. #1
It takes courage and integrity to apologize. We all misspeak sometimes, whether it’s because we are actually wrong in a belief or we simply miscommunicate our message. Apologizing is something Trump is incapable of. He doubles down or just denies what he said.

He's not getting the job done. Conservatives believe in limited gov't &amp; free trade. Trump? He promised to get rid of the deficit but deficit up more than 1/2 trillion by 2019. Trade wars, even w/ allies. Hasn't ended any real wars. Lies all the time. Hurts relationships w/ allies
You are inspiring. You had the courage to stand up for what is right, unlike your Governor who cowers to Trump. This is typical Republican supression of our democratic values that has become all too normal. You win the John Lewis “Good Trouble” award.
Time for young Americans to show trump who’s in charge.
Hey, remember at the beginning of the outbreak when Trump wanted to close the borders to infected countries but was then called racist?
I think there are other reasons they don’t allow family in the hospital other than the spread. I honestly think they just make elderly feel comfortable instead of helping them. They have to choose who gets ventilators ect.. had Trump not removed Obama’s policy on preparedness
Our government is busy trying to break Lebanon because the Lebanese government wanted to remove the Lebanese central bank governor Riad Salameh who is as crooked as trump.
It's the "what about the other guy" argument again. I'm not a Biden supporter either. But, disliking Biden or his policies is no reason to ignore the problems with Trump.
When Trump opens his mouth, you should know lies are going to come out of it. Who cares what he has to say on any issue? Whatever he says is a lie. Do you get it! Whatever Trump says is a LIE. A LIE , A LIE. If you believe him, you are dense, mentally disturbed, duped, or dumb.

So, you're just going to blindly support Trump regardless of anything he's done or said? All of the racist things he's said &amp; done don't bother you. How about fraud? Does that bother you? Lying good w/ you too?
Wild statement coming from a woman that supports Trump
This kind of thing isn’t even worth responding to. It’s taking Trump’s bait. I don’t think that even Trump’s evangelical base is so deluded that they would take this seriously. The priceless tweet so far is that Trump has been in Stormy Daniels more than he’s been in a church.

Advisers to President Trump hesitated to give military options and warned adversaries over fears he might start a war - CNNPolitics
Walter Schaub rightly critiques politicization of Christian faith. One key change I hope to see in the rebuilding of conservatism in post-Trump years, is keeping Jesus out of politics, in coherence to 1st amendment. Separation of church and state.

That’s WELL under the 2M Fauci predicted!!! So... you all say Trump did a terrible job! Your such hypocrites how about you demonize your demoncratic Governor’s for allowing older people to be placed in nursing homes where there are outbrewaks! Hold THEM responsible but NO
I've been trying to build a voice on here for a few years, but Twitter suppresses it. The harder the Dems push for Biden, the more and more certain I am that Trump must win in November.
NY Proves Trump’s Point: 20% of Mail-In-Votes Tossed, Leading To Democratic Win
Biden speaks inartfully about the Black community. Trump pounces. Media then blows it out. I posted about bad campaign coverage a couple days ago.

Trump declares TikTok a “national emergency”. Many parents of teens agree.   Trump signs executive order to ban US transactions with owners of TikTok and WeChat in 45 days

She or Harris would be great picks. Both are highly experienced and extremely bright. Both will be subject to vicious attack and, yes, everything having to do with Obama and Clinton will be relitigated by the R’s, particularly since Trump’s foreign policy has been so successful.
Got beachfront property in the Florida panhandle? Trump says he ‘ordered’ no drilling off the Florida coast but there’s no evidence of any such order
Oh, I’m not denying that he clearly touches too much, but you can’t throw up his grandson and call him a stranger. It would be like me putting up the pic of Ivanka on Trumps lap and saying “Look at Trump w a teen girl he doesn’t know.”
Graham has been one of the biggest disappointments of the Republican Senate. He was once considered a voice that could moderate Trump’s behavior, but when McCain died, he showed his true colors. He has no dignity. He is no statesman. He is a political windsock.
No shot if Trump said this most people giving him the benefit of the doubt in these comments would feel the same way
Voter suppression. Political manipulation of the stock market. Slowing down the US Postal Service. Misrepresentation of pandemic data. This is just the beginning of the anti-democracy tactics Trump and the Republicans will be using to stay in power.
If they open their borders in Canada, and Trump wins. . . I'm gone!

Editorial cartoon: Trump’s America: First to worst. ‘It is what it is’
Trump is no longer ‘loved nor feared’ — he’s just become a ‘joke’: conservative
This should tell the nation everything about Trump, that those closest to him fear giving him choices and information. They recognize how dangerous he can be. Can you imagine a president so dangerous that his own advisors withhold information? This is the American President.
Still no facts or evidence that TicToc is a nat’l security problem presented to the public, just general concern. My guess is that this is more retribution by Trump. He wants TicToc muted before the election because they present a political problem for him, not the country.
These are the faces of evil. I hope they all go to jail,but I know they won’t. We could never get a conviction in the deep state area, but Trump will be hounded the rest of his life for trying to MAGA.  I am so glad I don’t live in Trump-hating states.
What is your point? Trump shows  up in companies that are manufacturing things Americans need to thank them and show us what is being done here in America. I don’t care that he doesn’t throw a pitch at a baseball game. Why do you?
President Trump should commute his sentence.

Trump bans dealings with Chinese owners of TikTok, WeChat
Hell yes, we got to get everyone to vote Trump,
Everyone feels this way. I'm afraid if it doesn't happen by the election, Trump will lose.
I'm curious, do Trump defenders, who have 2 contort themselves into ridiculous positions daily, ever feel embarrassed in the aftermath? Shamed? Is there any sense of self-loathing? Anger that  perversely persists in antics that put his supporters in ridicule?
President Donald Trump has ordered a sweeping but vague ban on dealings with the Chinese owners of social media apps TikTok and WeChat on security grounds.
Trump and the Republicans can attack no one. Their positions on Civil Rights, Voting Rights, diversity, and inclusion are widely known. They have problems with those issues.
trump did his best to also pretend tha Obama wasn’t an American either. Hopefully the only place trump would watch the Biden presidency is in a jail cell without his cellphone.
I for one does not want to hear the feelings of an idiot. Not voting for Biden is a vote for trump you numb skull.
Because I trust  I respect this choice. She has called Trump out at every chance she has gotten when he’s wrong which is all the time.
Well that works if you are proud to be associated with the party who refused to removed a traitor from office, cannot come up with Covid plan, lies to America every day, and has murdered citizens with depraved indifference. That REPUBLICAN PARTY? Trump and his buddies killed GOP!
Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
First India's potential band now supercell's involved Trump did a huge oopsie
Imagine the Clinton's being banned from having a Charity Foundation like Trump, who STOLE MONEY FROM KIDS WITH CANCER and have been banned to be trustees in a like trust.  The country us burning and you are bellyaching about this insignificant crap.
Republicans should be going after the Covid death crisis....160,000 dead Americans because Trump cannot come up with a freaking plan...thank god we are not in a war with him in charge.  You need to get your priorities straight.
She needs to grow a pair because the left is showing no mercy...Payback for Trump and GOP not removing his treasonous ass from office.  We don't pussyfoot around when our dander is up...Other GOP candidates....beware.  you have awakened your worst nightmare!
Separation of Church and state...practice your faith....you are NOT allowed to force your faith on others.  You want government out of your religion? Keep your religion the hell out of government.  BTW Biden lives what he believes, Trump lives like the godless shit he is.
So it is important to defend Trump's pronunciation of Thailand, but don't call him out on the Covid chaos or his murder of citizens with depraved indifference.  The Trump genocide of Americans.  Wow...good job Donnie on pronouncing Thailand correctly while killing US citizens.
Of course he’s no saint. Anyone who thinks they’re voting 4 a saint is stupid.u can’t distract me from Trump’s incompetence.
saying Michele Obama pronounces words wrong?  Please. Trump just this week. Thighland and Yo Semites? #trumpmispronounces
As a liberal, I'm perfectly comfortable with it. As a conservative, are you comfortable with the numerous Trump gaffes?
Kayne is an operative to help Trump cheat in order to win the election. Kanye’s sneaker company received Paycheck Potection Plan that was designed to assist small businesses keep employees. Yet Yeezy’s are made in Cambodia.
Will you Democrat’s prevent trump signing executive order to block evictions? Or will you praise him for  bypassing the GOP.... I’m going with preventing trump because you know.. politics
Headline is wrong.  It should read, “15 Stupid and/or alcoholic adults drink hand sanitizer”.  No one just does that; and it’s always someone who knows better.  It’s not an epidemic and Trump didn’t cause it.
I see the campaign is trying to cover up the racist remark. 😂😂😂. This is why they won’t let joe debate trump.
True racism slips out from you every now and then, don’t it joe? What if trump said that? You would call for his removal from office
Seriously. Are liberals comfortable with this??   I get you hate trump. But watch this. It’s sad.
Human Centipede is a documentary about Trump supporters

Heyyyy reminder that we gotta support the VP no matter who it is. Is Biden my first choice for president? Fuckin’ nope. But that’s who we’ve got. And we’ve got to support and vote for him and his VP to get Trump out of the fucking White House.
If I had balls, I would stick it out until someone figured out that it was a reference to Trump fans criticizing JL for "getting too political." But I really can't handle that stress right now.

If you really are a Trump supporter, don't play the same game of dirty pool like the MSM and dems do. Be responsible! Here's my proof your tweet is bogus:
Money should never trump human health and human life.  I know the income the rally brings to Sturgis.  One must ask themselves, is this worth the risk now and the long term affects to those who get Covid and there are plenty.  Strokes, permanent lung damage, and heart problems.

The “Two Corinthians” trope is tiresome.   In some Christians circles, particularly European ones, this is how the book is pronounced. Trump is not a righteous man but when this line of attack is used it proves some are as ignorant of Christianity as they portray him to be.
Bank Fraud? Tax Fraud?
OMG - what’s with the “what most people know” sh*t?  Biden needs to promise to NEVER speak about African Americans again. EVER!!!!  If it weren’t for Trump this guy would never be elected.
Yet 38% looks at this and thinks, that is my guy. I want to follow him. Scary. Trump is insane and human garbage.   #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
His actual history says different. Being sued by the Fed govt (twice) for discriminatory housing practices, removing black dealers from your casino, saying you dislike black accountants, Central Park 5, and many more examples point to the belief that Trump isn't racist as false.
It’s because anything Trump for even if it’s good they r against it!
That was a bad take tonight on  Comparing Trump’s calling BLM a symbol of hate is nothing like what Biden said. BLM funds go directly to Liberal PAC!
Did anyone know that Rudy Giuliani's first wife was actually his cousin. Giuliani seams 2 dog everybody else out but he looks like white trash &amp; now that he's gotten older he's just dumb white trash. And when all this sh*t is up &amp; Trump's out-of-office I smell bars for Giuliani.
Only in the warped state of Trump.
Well, it certainly ain't Trump, his circle of evil and his lying minions....they wouldn't know a truth if it slapped them in the fact.

Sorry, but there is no longer a Republican party. It's now the party of Trump, which is a cult! And, I know things would have been much different if you're father had lived. He's one of the last Republicans that I could truly depend on to do the right thing, in most cases.
YES! It’s that critical! I would brave Covid to make sure he’s voted OUT. tRump &amp; GOP are  huge threat to our democracy!
No matter what he pledges to, Trump will never pay up.
Laundered $ from the trump campaign hits different I guess
All of the crap we went through the last four years, how to beat Covid, fixing the economy and creating jobs and getting people back to work....and giving ever GOP repub hell for their part in this Trump Travesty.....the weather....
trump has many stories of how Jesus spoke for the rich and money changers. Jesus also said to cheat, lie and steal every penny from the poor.
Sorry young man. Everything your party touches turns to a disaster. Look, Trump is difficult and abrasive but his administration is doing a great job.
After trump, the bar for GOP presidential candidates will be so low I’m afraid that any sliver of decency will be rewarded with electoral success. I mean, this man would be a king if we’d allow him to be, &amp; yet he’s only marginally losing in polls.  It should be +30 for biden.
If Biden has the ability to hurt God, then Biden is even more powerful than God. Does trump understand the wrath of God?

Since money to trump is God, and Biden is one of the few politicians that hasn’t grown rich in office, I guess it’s all about what or who you think God is.
Can you believe Trump accuses Joe Biden of hurting the Bible &amp; hating God, Trump is a Nazi in the WH he's so deranged. Tear gas those folks in Washington so he could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible, if he keeps going to churches he's going to burn them down.
You can't blame Trump for a virus that no one new how to handle it,and knew nothing about it,
This is why Alabama can’t have nice things. It’s a sad fact about our state that both the Confederacy and football will trump just about anything else, including good governance.
People forget quickly that the jobs/careers that most African-Americans hold were won by President Johnson and the Democrats. The claims that Trump brought black Americans their lowest unemployment rate are misleading.
This is war!  Their goal all along!
He is in the WH and his name is trump. Where’s my $10M?

Biden winning puts off real change longer. Trump winning puts the possibility of real change off to 2024. Real change has to come from the people. Biden is corporate puppet.
You mean the trump virus?
These in the picture most definitely make presumptuous and blasphemous claims in God's name. But I imagine they have been doing so for quite a while before Trump came along.
I use this Trump voodoo doll and I think it works a little sometimes.

So tell me what to look for on any of those things Biden said that will change the meaning of them. Also, Fred Trump was operations manager in the early 70s when that suit took place. They found a few complaints out of hundreds of black tenants. The manager was let go.

Trump is attacking Joe Biden’s faith, saying he is “against God.” The campaign should make an ad about his faith and how it drives his politics. Trump is the guy that hold a church crowd he doesn’t ask for forgiveness.

But I thought Trump was racist? Between “you ain’t black” and this, Joe has made it pretty clear how he feels about the black community.
Just awful. Every one of our moral superiors should get *at least* one get-out-of-jail-free card for arson. This is Trump’s America.
There has been more regulation on firearms during the Trump admin than there was during the Obama admin.

African Americans don't include every black female according to Joe Biden, Harris is Jamaican (The new Black Slave Opportunist in Democrat Left ball park). She does embellish American's as a political gesture activity, illogical a Californian Senator caring less for a clean State

Who told y’all Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were going to start locking people up when they both are committed to criminal justice reform which would include the decriminalization of marijuana, expunging past convictions, and rescheduling?

It's interesting that Kamala the former professional wrestler died in the same week that Joe Biden picked Kamala to be his VP running mate, think about it!
Biden does that a lot.
YOU don’t have to give her a chance.  WE, the majority of the American people are ready for real leadership, and Biden &amp; Harris will be excellent leaders, unlike the incompetence we’re now suffering through. #BidenHarris2020Landslide
i’m excited for the country that after four years of darkness we may actually see some light. Biden &amp; Harris will be competent responsible leadership to pull us through this pandemic and horrific economic downturn &amp; addressing systemic racism.
What?  Poor choice of words hiden biden...
Trump and Pence just got smacked around by Biden and Harris.   🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍
I’m gagging as  talks. Click. Just astounding how she’s so happy to be part of Racist/sexual predator Biden family. But #HeelsUpHarris is always ready to sell herself for power.
When Joe Biden speaks it makes EVERYONE ELSE look presidential  Fact
Also lied about employment. Under Obama/Biden 1.6 Million dropped out of work for. Only Trump them back to work.
Kamala going to be gushy gushy today. She has to thank Beau Biden for the nomination bc Joe said dead Beau made the decision.
under the OBAMA/Biden regime 1.6 Million people dropped out of workforce, worst record ever.  reversed it. More Americans employed in history under Trump. Highest stock market in history. You only have failure and racism to claim.
Two days, stroke and Kamala shoves Jill Biden aside
You better believe it. If Biden/Harris get elected our country as founded is lost. Unless we have R Congress the Left will destroy all we worked so hard to build.
Wouldn't be mad if Biden won in November and resigned in February... wouldn't be mad at all
That's what I was saying this AM!  People told me I would be wasting it instead of voting for trump or Biden. But I REFUSE to vote for sexual offenders.  Meanwhile you have a PhD lol
Slamming Biden for his support of segregation. He may have found a candidate for VP that didn't slam him so hard. Joe supported segregation, but no record of KKK membership that I have found. Mostly just political pandering.

You mean like VP Harris having come from Jamaica and her dad once said her grandmother stated she was a descendant of Hamilton Brown was a Irishman that owned a slave plantation on the Island which was involved in the slave trade. Therefore Joe Biden has a racist problem now.
Are you still a democrat? Genuine question. I only ask because the comments seem to be from ppl who started a new party and want to bring you along. At any rate, Biden has been working with Sanders. Moreover, don’t ever discount us older ppl, pls

I like what I just heard re: the Biden VP choice.

Kasich does whatever benefits Kasich. He is looking for a cabinet position with Biden. It is pretty slutty, but that is what politicians are.
I really thought the Dems could do better than Biden. The outlook for this nation is now bleaker than ever thanks to the complacency of the #DNC and the #GOP. No faith in this two-party system at all.

Why? Because Shaun is misleading you? Biden hasn’t picked a running mate
i can't find any record of biden ever approving any kind of funding for health justice, where are you getting the idea that he has ever "supported" any kind of abortion or health care?
trump's paid for more abortions out of pocket than biden has approved government funding for.    there's lots of reasons to support biden if that's your thing, but he has zero record of supporting health justice generally, and especially not abortion rights.
you realize biden was in a church when he made those "shoot them in the legs" comments, right?
That’s what everyone said in 2016. Can’t take this election for granted.  Many people dislike Trump and are disappointed by Biden being in the Democratic ticket. They may stay home.

Russia &amp; Ukraine sinking Joe Biden &amp; his son slowly, Ukraine court case filed against Biden in Ukraine. That money Joe &amp; Son took was a Ukraine fund with Russia, Biden is literally guilty.
Joe Biden has no defense for his irresponsible actions, known fully his son had absolutely no expertise in anything the Ukrainian Gas Co had supposedly paid him for, their President fled Ukraine &amp; Biden and his son came back to America with the Ukraine fund. That's it folks.
Soon once Russia and the Ukrainian's got back in-line with the monetary fund of Ukraine Biden took to America Ukraine brought charges against Joe Biden in Ukraine Court.
Biden denigrated himself in Ukraine esp to the Russian financial goals and responsibilities, money owed to Russia somehow was given away to Biden's son and his father Joe came and withdrew his son &amp; money back to America strong arming the Ukrainian Co deal with Russia.
Oh power, perhaps  has more diverse sincerity for the hundred's of dead murdered Christians of African countries than Biden has for the dead Latino's that did not make it crossing the US/Mexican border. Is Biden OK with Hedge Funding, BLM, riots, murders?

Ill wait until I read the platform but I don’t feel like I’m voting for anything when I will for democrats in 2020. I have 0 Enthusiasm about a Biden Harris ticket. If anyone else where in the White House I’d vote 3rd party and probably will in 2024 if Biden wins.
Can we please have the masked-up rallies for Biden-Harris now? 👏🏽 We can do this. ❤️
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let’s get to work.
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yes, I don’t think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.

DNC is loyal only to big donors including dark money. I don’t think Biden has a say - it is the DNC donors making the decision. And if Yang is for removing money out of politics - then not a good fit with the status-quo. My opinion only.
"Trail" not "Trial"- although Biden needs to pass trial &amp; go straight to judgement!
How many years has Biden been in politics?  What has he done in all that time to make a difference? He appears to have dementia

Wouldn’t it be amazing if trump tweeted “please don’t believe the false smearing of Joe Biden.  My intelligence advisors have told me they’re spreading false information on social media.”  Classy John McCain certainly would have.
Biden has a speech impediment making it hard for him to say some words. Trump has well we don’t want he has.
Look at all the privileged ass hats in the replies saying they won't vote for Biden because he's "just as bad as Trump". There is exactly ONE way to get Trump out of office. Vote for Biden and continue to support other progressive candidates for Congress.
Since Russia is so busy trying to discredit Biden, any truly patriotic American should obviously vote for Biden. A vote for Biden is  a poke in the eye for Putin
this show has become a mini clips for the Democratic talking points of the day. Each story to match up a talking point of closing the country down, COVID gross overstatement, Biden justifies stupid senile statements list is endless, an that flunky Cali Dr , shamefulThe Left: How dare the NYPD union support Trump!  Postal Union supports Biden.  The Left: We believe in USPS!  USPS: We can't deliver shit on time for the election.

Trump's racism could be used by the Dems to drive a few nails into his re-election coffin. There's plenty of data to support an anti-racist campaign against him, but the Dems NEED a LOUD voice! The louder the better! NOT Biden or Harris!
Biden is worse, only thing is, he’s been in politics for 50 years so he has made sure to hide most of his. Have you seen him sniffing and feeling up little girls??  Get over your hatred towards Trump! Most of what he said was when he was younger. People can’t change?
Tell it to the court. We will know who won. Biden!! They're outside Dejoy house now. Americans do not believe anything you say. Everybody is voting you out.

How about ask Biden what he had for breakfast today....  Imagine the answer, “I was eating toast when Corn POP came in with some milk and my hairy legs turned blond with excitement while sucking down some unicorn coffee from Starbucks.
M4whowantsit, Free college for under 125k, free community college, universal paid and family leave, wealth tax, etc. All policies proposed by Sanders that Biden did not originally have.
😂😂😂😂😂Like your hatred of Biden?
You think Joe Biden is the answer? If you want to tell me that you are going to vote some third party save it. You know that no third party candidate will win. Voting dem will be the end of this country as we know it.
His policies are, considering how many Biden adopted
So, you'll be just like Alabama--no chance in hell for Biden to win there.  So you could vote for anyone and South Carolina's Electoral College vote will all go to Trump. Sadly, that's the way it works.  The good thing?  You don't have to vote for the lesser evil.
Sadly, this seems to be Biden's platform.  Do we actually want Biden to demonstrate how much better he plans to be?  Does he intend to suck just a little less?  Judging from his past, that is the plan.  Biden sucks a little less.
Well, I'm finally convinced.  Trump sucks.  I just wish I had known that--wait, I've known that for five years now.  Aren't you just a "little" tired of this being the only campaign?  Each time Biden/Kamala says something bad about Trump a chance to cite a positive idea dies.
“It was a debate!” (Laughing)  So she is saying she lied during the debate? Either it was how she felt when she attacked Biden or everything she said was just an act? Well then I guess the little girl on the bus story was just for votes and she missed her calling in Hollywood.🎬
Well, hell yeah “Joe Biden had the audacity to pick a black woman”. Joe Biden is a real man who is not intimidated by strong women, &amp; he’s not an idiot racist. Biden sees that it’s past time for America to have women help lead the way. Watch &amp; learn, fellas.
Colbert's interview, he says "We'd call Biden and Kamala Rockefeller Republicans," and the two MSNBC pundits gladly and happily agreed with his assertion. No issues were discussed, but there was much talk about "identity" elements, which is I guess all that remains in the party.
Bruh fuck Joe Biden 🗣
Ig Biden gd. I hate to C it but I can't vote for a nigga that fired the Pandemic Response Team in the beginning of the worst modern pandemic this country has ever seen. Ik Biden ain't shit but he's something different from a nigga that has such a blatant reputation for racism+
I'm surprised you'd mention Social Security with Biden's statement about being willing to cut it.
The postal union endorsed Biden &amp; they're a crucial (as we're seeing) part of the electoral process. We can't disqualify stakeholders in our society on the basis of...being stakeholders. But yeah the leadership at very least of the  is just aching to wear brown shirts

Joe Biden said the same thing so your point is...?
Trump has not dared legalize or decriminalize marijuana since he took office... and you think war hawk Biden and #KamalaCop will???  #BeBold #VoteGold  Let's make #America Free again
Hell no, I doubt it! Go back to 2008-2009 with the H1N1 under Obama/Biden... compare all figures thru Wikipedia and draw your own conclusions.. Biden didn’t do anything spectacular then, and even not with debilitating dementia, past history shows it wouldn’t be different ‼️
Patriots, it's up to us! If Joe Biden wins, the entire corrupt Obama administration will be back. We will once again be stuck with Hillary, Eric Holder, Susan Rice and the rest of the Obama criminal bunch.
So is Joe Biden no longer a racist or rapist, as you alluded to during the primary debates?
After they lost their jobs thanks to ignoring a deadly virus.  Joe Biden is not president and has no power over jobs.
Not even close. Read responses by  Only thing 'abhorrent' is Biden's response. But that has come to be expected.
I wish I would get a polling call from the Biden campaign camp. I would say three words, “COME ON MAN!”  Then I would hang up.
He did. Ironic you should call forth the 1 President Since LBJ who hated America &amp;Americans. Obama may never see jail time, but we will get as close to him as possible.Why do you think Biden is "mentally declining"?If you suffer from dementia, can't face consequences. Conventient
JUST IN: National Association of Letter Carriers, a union that boasts nearly 300,000 active and retired postal workers, endorses Joe Biden, warning that the “survival” of USPS is at stake.
Look at the Democratic ticket; Joe Biden who’s cognitively degenerating And Kamala Harris, who’s pretending to be African black and from the hood. Just remember she will be president soon and there’s nothing  more dangerous than an aggressive power-hungry prosecutor!!!
Did you notice how Biden said “Be a patriot” while telling us that he will mandate mask wearing? Where have we heard the patriotic theme before regarding mask wearing? Oh yeah....that would be Trump.🙌🏻 Get your own material Joe!
Your a Biden supporter too 🤣 ok yes that makes sense now lol people like you are what will bring our country down for what you believe and support.
Biden-Harris can save on ads thanks to the Lincoln Project  #BidenHarris2020  #SaveTheUSPS
I really hope you are right.  I only see pockets of Trump signs but almost nothing for Biden.  If the idiots that are “Republican” vote for Biden because “Orange man bad” then it is because of media and low in voters.  Anyone with a brain can see all the good that has occurred.
Only after Nov 3rd. Biden and Harris want us to wear masks EVERYWHERE for the next three months! We're plagued with assholes and idiots.
From the past 24 hours: Kamala Harris doesn’t have birthright to run for VP From the past week: children are basically immune to COVID19, voting by mail has massive fraud, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support defunding the police Can’t list the rest, no space.
Was Biden's campaign operating out of Daphne?
Of course Biden's proposed federal mask mandate would be unconstitutional. But no one in the media will call him on it.
The serial plagiarist plagiarizes again. Big surprise.
Hear ya loud and clear. How is it possible that the voters of this great country have to choose between Donald Trump and Joe Biden?
We don’t validate reporters who are only trying to harm the country and get 5 seconds of “look at what I did” during press conferences - How about a video of Biden answering questions...I’ll wait
Who gives a rip what Biden says at this point. He’s just Polly 🦜 anyway and has no authority 4 anything except what the demoPhobics are proposing!
The hypocrisy of the Left is unreal. Harris was a cop and if we learned anything from the left it’s that “All cops are evil.” Not to mention her offering up proof that Biden was a racist who hung out with segregationist, and best of all she said she believes Biden’s accusers

You are a faux journalist. You try to make the news not report it. YOU are corrosive to our democracy. Trump will wipe the floor with Biden and Miss sleep her way to the top Harris.
He's but a puppet.  Harris  knows she will be President if Biden is elected--one way or another.
What did Obama or Biden do for you? Make more money? Get Society status? Able to give more head to people in authority? Shut the fuck up you dumb fucking person.

I hope she and Biden display some actual liberal ideas toward the working class, unlike Hillary.  You're never going to get elected whining about sexism--might get the most votes.  Seriously, Hillary would've done better if she had never mentioned the word "sexism."
Well, that would involve you staying in the basement with Biden.

Obama did zilch! Quit spewing such hatred. Nobody believes you👎🏻btw, who did you sleep with this time to get Biden to choose you😡
Kinda like Biden is a major candidate, who no one wanted
If he was popular, he wouldn’t have a 24% enthusiastic rate, and there wouldn’t be a major Instagram page literally called “Settle for Biden”, as well as multiple people saying how Biden was their last choice.

In the less than 24 hours since she appeared as Biden's running mate, Republicans and Democrats have tried to define who Kamala Harris is and what she brings to the ticket.
Biden and Harris proved it doesn’t take a rally to deliver a big message.  That’s what happens when you have something to say, and not a bunch of blather.
Mr. Biden, that is not what the PRESIDENT said. You're lying and trying to spin a comment into meaning something that it doesn't so you can use it to scare senior citizens. Shameful and deciptful...

Please, any of the candidates would have recieve it. Biden isn’t popular, Trump is its hated. No one is excited about Biden, just getting rid of Trump
I’m capable of disliking Trump and Biden at the same time. It’s quite simple really.
Once the Biden/Harris administration takes office I hope one of the first things they do is get DOJ to launch a thousand investigations into Trump.  I generally believe in not going after past presidents but this man has caused so much harm. We can't just let him go.  Prosecute.
So I see we have mainstream catching the attention of the voters. Fuck Biden

Perhaps Pirro knows (through the FOX's connection with RTV and QAnon) of a plot to bring harm to Joe Biden? She seems very confident as if she's the lead on this fear mongering statement! And it's fact that FOX will run this to ground, perhaps inspiring one of their viewers?
I asked how many did they run, not how many won. Also, Katie Porter, Katie Hill, and Lucy McBath ran in progressive platforms, so you can take those three off.  And Biden “dog-walked”, I remember when he was in last place
is it a coincidence that it happened the day after the announcement of the VP for Biden?
I believe Kamala Harris was the one who called Biden a segregationist, seeing how he collaborated with two of the most prominent segregationists at the time to stop bussing

I dont judge Joe Biden because of his old racist statements,  people can have a change of heart.      I judge him for his recent ones.
she’s very, very socialist in her leanings too, however. Much more than some of the other options Biden had to choose from. He went really radical instead of moderate.

Joe lies about what Trump says every time he speaks (when you can understand him). He never called #HeelsUpHarris “nasty”, he said she was “nasty to Biden during the debate.” But they know that.
Just watch the debates. Biden was great today and he’ll be great then. On the other hand... did you see the trump propaganda conference? 🤣
Biden and Harris are squarely in the pocket of Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Stock market will do well even if they get elected 😂

Democrats lauded Harris as a perfect complement to Biden’s centrist candidacy, but some Republicans argued the move only reinforces their allegations Biden has become a tool of the far left.
I don’t get it. The Trumplicans are arguing that Biden picked Harris because she’s black. Then they say she’s not actually black. How does this even make sense?
Easy... backing the blue does not mean the same as mass incarceration. Imagine a country with  no police. We need the police... we don’t need the legislation that disproportionately effects the black community which is what Biden and Harris have done.

First  From the very first day of this Administration, President Trump has set our Nation on a path to freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would set America on the path of SOCIALISM and DECLINE.
That pick shows that Biden and the Democrat Party have been overtaken by the Radical Left. Given their promises of higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine and Abortion on Demand, it’s no surprise he chose Senator Harris, she is weak on crime and refuses to put America
￼  Friend,  It is the honor of my life to serve our Country, alongside President Trump, as the 48th Vice President of the United States.  I see that Joe Biden has picked Senator Kamala Harris as his VP nominee.
For anyone who care what they have to say, I got an email in my BS account from the TRUMP campaign and I hope you all don't vote for Biden for the love of your life, your family, your country and your freedom of expression and civil rights.

All of them knew. Even Joe Biden. NONE OF THEM told trump. They let us die. And you want to be mad at us over those SOB’s? Eff You Sea Que Why Oh You!
I said that the issues were caused by the virus. Then I said that Harris and Biden don't have any better ideas. If they do and they are keeping them to themselves then I think we have an even bigger issue.
Biden's choice for V P running mate is a victory for apartheid Zionist supporters. The possibility of a significant shift in American foreign policy towords justice in Palestine and against apartheid Zionism is now remote. The Trump-style support of apartheid Zionism continues

He never said white women why are all the leftist saying he's being racist when he's NOT. Vote for biden and whenbhe wins you will see who really is racist BIDEN is 100%
I'm white and I live in a neighborhood thats 85% black and im the lowest earned family in the neighborhood. No one here is a Biden supporter because they know how evil he is
I hope everyone knows that if you like your freedom and like to continue to keep your freedom you should not vote for Biden. 6 years ago i heard him say with my own ears from his mouth that they need to be put back in chains, you can guess who he was talking about.
Some of these "progressives" saying they can't vote for this ticket because of Kamala's AG days, or "Biden is a Republican"...or whatever...y'all still think this is a fucking game? You're worse than the MAGA hats. This shit ain't a sprint, it's marathon.

I'd nominate a Supreme Court justice if there's a vacancy before the election says Donald Trump as he claims that a Joe Biden victory will mean 'you'll have to learn Chinese'  via
Do you believe your friend and colleague’s belief that Biden is a sexual predator?
Kamala canNOT be President because of her parents status when she was born.  Dems deliberately chose her so Biden can resign/die by January’21 and PELOSI would be President... 🤢🤮🤢

Joe Biden taps Kamala Harris as VP pick. She will certainly go down in history.
Neither   nor  intend to debate Biden or Harris. They're going to scream they want to do it, then make ridiculous demands. And claim Biden and Harris were afraid because they refused to debate standing on their heads and drugged.
Reaction to Biden-Harris Democratic presidential ticket
Hell, criticize them to your hearts content. Kamala has been calling for defunding the police recently though, and picking her was a better move than picking Klobuchar (marginally). But also no one could make Biden look other than he is at this point. He's still not Trump.
Tulsi sucks and I don’t fully trust her but Kamala is abysmal. I’m voting for Biden but I personally think this pick could end up hurting the campaign.
Riden with Biden  Fairest with Harris.
News says: Biden chooses Kamala Harris. NO HE DINT!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Biden can have all the votes from us he want trump win the electoral college
Y’all really been going non stop about Biden/Harris and I hope y’all have terrible sex the rest of y’all miserable lives
Really?? Well, I don't think Jesus would be very pleased with the milk of kindness offered by the likes of Biden, Harris, most Democrats, BLM, abortionists, Antifa. All the products of a century of Progressive Liberalism, bent on the destruction of the Republic
🇺🇸🦅 slow creepy pedo CHINA joe biden and krazy phony kommunist kamala harris; perfect for their communist party endorsement❗️❗️  DISASTEROUS &amp; TOTALLY WRONG FOR AMERICA ❗️❗️  VOTE TRUMP FOR ALL OUR SAKES❗️SAVE OUR FREEDOM, OUR LIBERTY &amp; OUR COUNTRY❗️🦅🇺🇸

I went outside to sit in the sunshine, and started reading about Harris as Biden’s vp pick. Then a dark storm cloud rolled in and blanketed the sky. Winds came in from the East. Leaves were blasted from the trees. My porch door was blown open, and papers were strewn about.
Haha, good one. Too bad Biden is a puppet to the DNC, and Kamala Harris thinks Biden is a sexual abuser and a racist. Not sure how those two ended up together. What do you think, Patty?
I am, and straight Blue, starting with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Actually my apologies towards Chris Wallace, he is a tough interrogator, but why doesn’t somebody like he pull Biden out of the damn bunker and ask him unprompted questions?
I’ll kiss you on the mouth if Biden wins! He won’t! He can’t even make his own decisions. He is simply a pawn in the DNC’s game. You must admit that he is simply not the best candidate for you guys. He just has the most popular name. #kamalaharrissucks
Good job DNC! Choosing the same candidate who ripped Biden a new one on his racist remarks/policies and sided with his sexual assault accusers. But hey, she’s a woman of color. That’s all that matters to the Dumbass National Committee

Well at least at Fox, Chris gets to voice his opinion, but at CNN, MSNBC, CBS and ABC, you don’t get to voice your opinion... you read the script. But I will say one thing, when I see him interview Joe Biden and not “pull punches “ then he will become “more” credible to me.
President Trump told reporters at a White House briefing that Kamala Harris “was very disrespectful to Joe Biden” during the Democratic primaries, and said “it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful.”
Sen. Kamala Harris once said that she believed women who accused Biden of inappropriate touching.  IN HER OWN WORDS. “I believe them, and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” the California senator told reporters in April 2019.

I’ve heard Biden’s latest campaign ads too. They’re copied from President Trumps accomplishments &amp; what he’s already fighting to get done for us. Biden is a copycat, plagiarist &amp; liar.......not to mention....a wimp!
1. VP Pence will make her look incompetent  2. Biden may pretend to have the virus to get out of debating President Trump.
It's all for votes!  Biden chose her because he got an ultimatum saying he must choose a black woman.  She's suddenly Black American for same reason. BLM will still demand destruction of America!
Last time I checked Biden’s never actually been the President during any of those 50 years, whereas Trump’s been POTUS for the last 4 years and yet he still talks about what he will do and not what he has done because all he’s done is damn near DESTROY THE COUNTRY! 🙄🙄🙄 #ETTD
The Democratic party rejects the plank to legalize marijuana... put $ behind Biden, the architect of crime bill... and now #KamalaCop as VP... Democrats are here to incarcerate you ....
Start with a p, ends with omg, but it's not what Biden does to his britches.
Curious to see how she, Biden and their MSM pals wriggle out of all the public statements that have been made.
Biden/Harris: the ideal target-rich environment! (Oops! Was I too passive-aggressive there?)
Oh yes nasty women are going to get Biden and Harris elected
If Bran just stays warging into Biden throughout his term we might be all good guys.
Aye if Bran just stays warging into Joe Biden throughout his entire term we might be all good.
You mean Biden?  Isn’t up for criminal charges in the Ukraine. No Quid Pro Quo Job. “And the Son of a Bitch got fired”
Kamala Harris’ extreme positions, from raising taxes to abolishing private health insurance to comparing law enforcement officials to the KKK, show that the left-wing mob is controlling Joe Biden’s candidacy, just like they would control him as president.
Adding my two cents, kudos to Joe Biden on a great selection of Kamala Harris. It makes me proud to be a Democrat today!!!
Biden or trump we really gotta choose the lesser evil 😂
Then you never intended to vote for Biden, right? That would have been a better, far more accurate &amp; refreshingly honest statement to make. "I wasn't voting for Biden, however, I'm desperate for attention during these scary changes &amp; social progression, I'm a simpleton" ta-da!🤷🏻‍♂️
Biden picks Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
"JOE BIDEN IS RACIST SO IMMA BE HIS RUNNING MATE" -Kamala
You’re exactly right I drive about 1500 miles a week all over the southeast. Never see a Biden sign I’ve seen one bumper sticker,one out of thousands of cars
"Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris to be his vice presidential running mate"
Girl what? Do you realize all the sus shit Biden has said when it pertained to integration and segregation. Harris literally called him out on supporting policies of segregationist but it’s whatever
I DON’T mean that you should vote Biden/Harris and then go ignore politics for the next 4 years. No. If you don’t like the Dem slate, get involved at the lower level. Vote local, vote city, vote county, vote state, vote school board (even if you don’t have kids), vote dogcatcher.
Look folks, my reaction to the Biden/Harris ticket can best be summed up as ‘mixed, complex, and nuanced’, but I am still voting for them against Trump. This is not a ‘take your ball and go home’ moment given how our system actually, y’know, WORKS.
No. But I'm not voting for Biden either.
So far the race for a Biden VP is a “Run for the Roses”.
Im thinking about voting for the first time. I never voted because i dont want to do jury duty lol. Can you give me some reasons to vote for Biden over Trump? Thank you!
Too bad after like a month Biden will be declared not fit for office and then peoples votes for him would be for nothing. She’ll destroy our economy with the things she proposes.
You think wrongly, my friend.
as if biden wasn’t bad enough he picks kamala as his vip ?!!
Dearest Joseph Robinette Biden ( ),  Thank you.  We. Are. Ready.  Signed,  The #KHiveForBiden   #BidenHarris2020
And everyday calling for Obama’s birth certificate was, even after he provided it?? This is more proof we have the wrong person in the Oval Office. Don’t know if Biden is either, but compared to this, I am all for it!
Difference is Biden knew he had mispronounced it, Trump mispronounced it twice &amp; didn’t know he did anything. We are better off without him. I will always feel that way. Watch the Axios interview, no defending it.
In the midst of a defund the police movement Biden picks Kamala Harris as his VP choice.
So, who’s trying to listen to me rant about the Biden-Harris ticket, black voters, the DNC speaker list, and more.😭 I got the time today.
Joe Biden selects Senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate.
That would make too much since for black people. Remember this is a dog and pony show.  His selection was premeditated. She is a token black.  She has a track record that spells trouble for our community  No matter who wins, Trump/Biden. The same thing will happen FOR "Black" ppl
Did Sleepy Joe forget that only months ago Kamala Harris attacked him for his racist policies? Now he is handing over the reins of the Presidency to her and the radical left. #al01 #alpolitics
Biden VP pick: Kamala Harris chosen as running mate. Whoop! Whoop!
Don’t really want to vote for Trump or Biden smh
He was having a real hard time running against Biden  He will now focus his attention on the black woman running as VP.
has spent entire career in upholding the rule of law, which  has spent his entire life trying to avoid.  -
biden will now attempt a law and order campaign
And just like that....Kamala loves Joe Biden. 🤣🤣🤣
I just received a message from Joe Biden. He chose Kamala Harris as his Vice President!!! 💞❤💞❤💕 #bestchoice #IStandWithBlackWomen
Biden selects California Sen. Kamala Harris as running mate
So didn’t Kamala say she believed Biden’s accusers....but she will run on the ticket with him?  Well there goes the Me Too movement.🤦🏼‍♀️

Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.
picks   - Yay. I'm with them.
I’ll gladly vote Biden/Harris, but yeah, not exactly my first choice.
Kamala Harris? Biden? Democrats have duped the "Black" community again.  Do y'all realize how many of our people have been tossed in jail (with the key thrown away) because of the actions and inactions of these two?  Wow #DoingTheSameThingAndExpectingDiffefentResultsIsINSANITY
Biden just announced Kamala Harris as his VP pick! Woohoo!!!
So, Joe Biden is going with Kamala Harris as his VP. I think that she's more risky than some of the other candidates but she's definitely qualified and I have no issue with voting for that ticket.  And neither should any of you.
So Biden picked Kamala Harris for his running mate.

Biden needs foreign policy help because he is always wrong on foreign policy:   Plus, he's a "demagogue."
Ronald Reagan warned us against Joe Biden&lt;br&gt;
In other words, Biden’s handlers have chosen and informed him who’s name will be announced today.
Joe Biden has selected his running mate, revealing to top advisers the woman he will invite to join his ticket, two people familiar with the matter say
Advisors tell Joe Biden who they have chosen to be his running mate**
He is as much of a conservative as Biden is of sound mind.
What cognitive issues? Biden has been a gaffe machine his whole career, and there are multiple montages showing Trump and Biden both equally stumbling words and confusing events (eg, just yesterday Trump says 1917 pandemic ended WWII).
Whoever Biden selects as his VP running mate, she will be 1,000% better than our current VP! And I dearly hope that she will speak "truth to power" with the President rather than soulless wimp that currently holds the office!
so when Biden sold our country to China that made him a great vp?
Any debate between Presidential candidates would be a farce because Biden would have the questions given to him before hand as well as his prepared answers.
If it IS #KamalaHarris that Biden’s handlers choose, which one will it be?🤔
Exactly. The Trump platform is all about fear &amp; hate-fear of Biden &amp; hatred of other Americans. With no principles/policy to go by, Trump must have conflict to survive -the last 4 yrs prove this. If today’s America is your happy place, vote Trump. For the rest of us it’s Biden.
A Biden/Rice ticket pretty much lets  go on to victory by doing not much more than letting the Trump campaign punch itself out. Don't underestimate how many people are *really* pissed at Trump and plan to vote Biden no matter what anyway, so half of this is theater. 2/2
You know why I say Susan Rice is a safe choice? Because, when all the right has on her is Muh Obamagate, there's not much damage that can be dealt to her. Nothing they've thrown at Biden is sticking either, and the Trump campaign is going to be all offense out of necessity. 1/2
Alabama Sen. Doug Jones will be among the speakers at the Democratic National Convention next week, a virtual event at which the party will formally nominate Joe Biden as its presidential candidate.
So it' obvious that if Biden doesn't pick a black woman for his VP then the Blk community will turn to Trump to spite Biden? Just guessing that the BLM would evaporate as they would no longer have the support from all Americans nor a donor base to support them! Blacks for Trump?
With Biden likely to pick a Black woman as VP, here’s how the media can avoid playing into sexist and racist trope…
Good statement from Bernie but it begs the question: Why have your Bernie Bros taken it upon themselves to disparage every female candidate for Biden's VP? Why have they enlisted Russian bots in their plans? Why are they trashing your stated goals to suit their own agenda? Why?
Reminder to Democrats: VP Pence is not a democrat! Quit trying to get Biden to select another Pence or Trump will win in 2020 by such vocal shortsightedness!
...very much like what is going on now with Biden. Trump listened, and his choice was made by himself, Jared and Ivanka. We now have Pence as VP. The question is do we want Joe to listen to the loudest voices, or do we want him to select a VP that will work hard for us,or a joke?
B.S.    Biden doesn’t know anything except what he’s told 2 say! Get real‼️
Man, if Biden picks Susan Rice as his VP; it will be 2016 all over again. I got tired of heating about Benghazi.
Have you idiots heard Joe Biden talk about little kids rubbing his hairy legs in a swimming pool are maybe the one where he’s riding a cockroach?
Biden is heeding Napoleon’s advice: ‘Never murder a man who is committing suicide.’”
I encourage Mr. Biden to be as outrageously stupid as his l'il heart desires. After all, he's VERY competent, they tell us.
That could change though, I doubt Biden’s made up his mind
Then Biden said.... Who's Harry Truman..?
Biden subscribes to the theory that a huge LIE told often will be believed by the masses who don't pay attention. Trump NEVER said he would defund Social Security!
I am voting on November 3 for Joe Biden, I don't care who he picks as VP. The situation is critical.
This is the same man who can’t quote any scripture that important to him because he doesn’t read the Bible. If he revered God he wouldn’t have autographed Bibles. If he was just a little religious he wouldn’t be judging Biden’s faith or saying he hates God He’s a piece of work
49% and to date no debate !! If he can’t debate he certainly doesn’t have what it takes to run a county. Of course China supports him... they will own the USA if Biden wins! God help us all.
To play rope-a-dope, at some point you need to be able to land a killer punch. Biden can't.
Folks.... Don't worry, Biden will not be running the Country... His VP and Cabinet will.
Wow.  Pelosi says "China Would Prefer Joe Biden". #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Trump can cry about the Obama admin all he wants (most of what he say is BS ofc) but I'd gladly vote for a Biden/Rice ticket.

I don't believe any of the polls, including Fox's, are reliable. Just at face value, Biden's campaign and candidacy seem DTF ( doomed to fail), but I also believe there's an "October Surprise" waiting in the wings.
He does have 8
Yeah, because none of that happened until Trump was elected. Guess Biden's going to use the red phone to call Aquaman and fix it.

Yeah you must not listen to Biden speak much. Every time he speaks to a black journalist or commentator, he makes racist comments. His latest where he said “come on man, did you have to get checked to see if you have cocaine in your system?” (Paraphrased). He is truly racist!
Opinion Communist China is actively helping Joe Biden and Amazon Compost is a active part of the communist China propaganda.
I keep hearing all this talk from Biden advocates about taking away our 2nd Amendment rights.  If you don't have a clue about what's being said, if you have loved ones to protect, keep your guns!  If good people don't have guns, bad people will !!
I don’t care if someone looks like Gandhi next to Trump, I can’t about what needs to be done, and Biden doesn’t go far enough.
No, it’s not Biden is a moderate. His policies and how he believes they can be achieved are moderate.
His College for all act would have been easy to implement. A simple speculation tax of mere pennies would have paid for everyone’s tuition. Clearly it as good, has even Biden took it, except now he’s made it harder for it to pass

Since Halloween is pretty much canceled,  why don't we have some fun on November 3rd.  We could dress up as super heroes or costumes of your choice.  Voting for Biden with a big smile as we kick Trump out of the White House
About as big as Biden's crowds.
Had a wild thought  Since we know Halloween is pretty much canceled,  why don't we all show up in Super Hero costumes when we vote on November 3rd. With everything going on in this country,  I know I'll feel like a Hero when I vote Biden as our next president
Why isn’t Biden in jail for graft and greed and using his office as VP to line his pockets and lean on other countries like a mafioso Godfather! He makes he sick to my stomack and Harris is a puke 🤮 of a woman

“If Biden loses the presidential race, the same will be true: He’ll go on. He’s survived far, far worse. The real question isn’t about him. It’s about us. Can we?”
Actually?  I think about this shit every time I see somebody say "so Biden went with the cop, huh?".    We've been nipple deep in con men for the past four years; it hurts me to the bottom of my heart to say it, but I think we could use a cop with an axe to grind right about now.
I have a better idea since you’re so thirsty for Biden , why not just let him be President now ? Trump is obviously not doing it for you . 👍🏽
BIRTHERISM = RACISM. I WANT A PRESIDENT WITH POSITIVE QUALITIES. TRUMP TRADES ON THE EVIL IN HUMANITY. I WILL VOTE BIDEN-HARRIS!
Americas stronger with gropey hands Biden? I dont think so. We dont need a pedofile in the white house.
That's close. I wish it were like Australia. I'd love to watch Trump.and Biden wrestle crocodiles before having to survive the outback for a week.
“The idea that they would enjoy the same immunity to consequences and accountability that they gave Trump is ridiculous.” Looking at you,
You definitely on the Biden Bus
By the looks of this Chart top to bottom, it seems like the President it's referring to is Black or something. Trump isn't racist; The Media trains you. The left pretends like pat-down Bloomberg or You ain't black Biden.

Hopefully President Biden fires this guy as his first official act. Many people depend on the post office for meds. This can be a life or death situation.
First, stop whining and acting defeated. Why would you think the full weight of the american people will fail to stop this sabotage of the post office? Did trump succeed in getting Ukraine to harm biden? Did he get caught and made to stop caging kids?
This is the stupidest tweet I've ever read. Biden stomped Bernie and the entire field in the Dem primary and now he is stomping trump in the election and your conclusion is people hate him.  Laughing at your stupidity

The only thing the Obama-Biden Admin did was drive a bigger wedge between Israel and UAE
THIS.  And it’s a crime and political malpractice that, until Joe Biden’s campaign came along in 2019, the only person effectively prosecuting the case against this sort of elitism was a Vermonter socialist.
Joe Biden wrapped up the nomination way faster in ‘20 than Barack Obama did in ‘16.  Biden has united 97% of the party this early, in a way Hillary Clinton never did or could.  Excuse me while I laugh at aides to either pretending Biden’s not good enough.
Please do not focus on bad things about Biden or Harris (I am fully aware thank you). I want to hear why you support Trump. Make him the priority of your post.
Ok all you Trump supporters I have a challenge for you. I doubt you will respond. I challenge you to only post factual items about Trump. Convince me. If posts are about Biden or Harris, they must be direct quotes or facts that can be proven. Nothing salacious.
Did you see the excerpt from Biden’s rant against a reporter saying he graduated w 3 degrees, top of his law school class, had a superior IQ. Then they show all the networks doing fact cks. All total Bullshit. Delusion but delivered w such vehemence. He believes his own lies.
So Biden has God so afraid that he put you in charge to be the protector of America ?

The truth is both parties suck but the Republicans suck worse. The DNC has fucked progressives over for two straight elections, so progressives are rightfully not very excited about a Biden/Harris ticket. But we understand it’s the lesser of two evils.
Report: Biden personally intervened to get the word 'occupation' removed from the Democratic Party platform
Biden–Harris Rollout Marred by Empty House, Power Outage, Delays  via  USA   BAHAHA. bahaha!! Manner banner!!
No because Kamala would be the 2nd in command so He is 2nd Gentleman. Just as Dr. Biden was when VP Biden was VP
Biden called her "Camel-a" yesterday when he was introducing her🤔
Kamala Harris Lies Repeatedly in First Speech as Biden’s Running Mate. #shocker 🙄
Her and Obama are buddies anyway so I’m sure he suggested her to Biden as a VP
Mark Levin: Biden's VP pick Kamala Harris brings 'nastiness' to the table
This man won’t make promises he doesn’t intend to keep. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris together will restore our country to the magnitude and greatness we remember.
Above all, in my opinion Joe Biden is a good man. He is a Christian. He practices his faith. He has experience and is respected among world leaders. He has integrity. He has known loss and he has love in his heart. He is strong and knows healing. He is a survivor.
That’s what we need. Biden is not afraid of a challenge. I like that about him. He doesn’t mind someone who disagrees with him. He knows when to listen to someone who knows better than him on a particular subject. He respects truth and honesty.
That’s what grownups are supposed to do. It’s the president of the United States job to compartmentalize. Joe Biden can do this. Trump can not. Kamala Harris will compliment Joe Biden. She will advise him; not always agree with him. His cabinet will probably be diverse.
He seeks to heal our wounded nation by combining the elite minds from the top of their fields, whether they agree with him or not. As long as the United States of America improves from their knowledge, Joe Biden is willing to listen and act in our best interests.
Vice President Joe Biden is a Democrat. He is not a dictator, an authoritarian, or a neofascist. He would never undermine an election. If he felt an election were in jeopardy, he would allocate funds to ensure a fair and just process.
She is a trash candidate. She wants to ban assault rifles via executive action. She wants to ban plastic straws for some reason. She want socialized Medicare. And she’s against fracking. Why the hell did Biden choose this woman? He already had California and the black vote.
Fuck Joe Biden
Here ya go for all those that want Biden in 2020. You telling me you agree with his statements? Now all the sudden he’s changing his mind cause he cares about you? Nope, he wants votes!!! PERIOD!!!
The most troubling &amp; dangerous thing about Trump than is abuse of power,mental health,narcissism,&amp; pettiness is his own goddamn ego! Regardless of what people think of Biden,We need someone better that Trump. 4 more years of Trump and everyone's not gonna stand for it!
Senator Kennedy On Harris Becoming Biden’s VP Pick: She’s AOC ‘Without The Bartending Experience’
Kamala Harris represents 'complete socialist takeover of Joe Biden,' Trump 2020 adviser Schlapp says  #FoxNews
Is the idea here that the Biden campaign is weak and slow because it’s currently beating the Trump folks by a historically large margin for modern elections?
It’s really, really popular in media and Very Online circles to dismiss “evangelicals” as a gigantic, lost cause Trump voting bloc.  Thank God the Biden team hasn’t bought into it.
And I think the biggest reason why is that the Biden campaign ( et al) has made sure these important constituencies aren’t only being spoken to by the GOP.   makes this point a lot, and it’s important: we should never surrender to Trump in this space.
Most of these folks never liked Trump to begin with, but none of them even considered voting for Democrats in ‘16. In fact, they took active steps to avoid doing so.  For a few reasons, their calculus has changed drastically in ‘20, and most are now affirmative Biden voters.
The Biden campaign has brought these groups closer together than ever before, at least from my vantage point.  Dozens of “evangelical Christians” I know and love have given up on Trump. The cages, the gassing of protesters, the racism — it was all too much.
Boy we saw it first hand. What a horrible President that idiot was &amp; to show how many stupid people are in this Country they elected him twice &amp; that's exactly why I know Biden will win. He doesn't know who he is, but he'll win.
Can you dispose of Biden ? He’s garbage
Trump supporters: we can't live in fear from something like a virus because we'll die anyway  Same people: *swallows 10 pills and uses essential oils like it's weed* You know, Biden is going to take away all the guns and supports ANTIFA
It helps that the media was dedicated to praising everything Obama/Biden did. Hell, it didn’t matter if was Fast and Furious, Benghazi, spying on U.S. citizens; the media bowed at their feet. Now the media be as hell😂
Hmm his dad must have been a racist and a rapist too. That is what she called joe Biden in the primaries 😂😂😂😂 if you vote for the racist and the radical leftist you are a moron.
This Trump rally in the White House being the chaser to the Biden/Harris shot we got earlier sucks.    It's like drinking milk after the shot of tequilla.  Gross.
Joe Biden has a relatively unique ability among national political figures to make fun of Trump for his whining, and we should be looking for more of it as summer turns to fall.
Joe Biden just said Trump has done nothing but sign executive orders. Hmmm. You talking about that executive order to extend unemployment benefits that your party wouldn’t pass bc they wanted to play politics?  Please, playa🙄
Biden didn't talk in a stream of consciousness garbled mess and Senator Kamala Harris just gave the speech of her career.  It really contrasts with the "me me me" Trump keeps displaying.
I really don’t understand why people are doing this. Like yes she might be terrible. But Pence/Trump is worse. No Biden isn’t who we really want. But we definitely don’t want Trump again. It’s not like we have a lot of options.
The Biden-Harris Administration. That's the tweet.
Did Joe Biden just call her Komdalisa at his press conference?
WE certainly WILL.  Voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
Harris will make a great addition to the Biden team.  Just ask Your HUSBAND.
The question at this point is who do you think will do less damage as POTUS? Trump or Biden?
That's California Joel. Her record as the AG is very suspect esp with incarcerating blacks. The Dems already have California for 2020. The front of the ticket remains Joe Biden, whom Kamala accused of being a racist. Lot more problems on the Dems ticket.
You’d think I’d be mad that I ran over my damn Wayfarers I’ve had for 5 years but it gave me an opportunity to order some Biden shades
The fact that every fucking celebrity is like “🥺✨😍Biden/Harris 2020 🥰🥳”   I can’t even process how fucking fucked we are.
The offical mascot of Joe Biden’s campaign
Biden is basically where a third term Ronald Reagan would have been if not worse in his progression, no way they put him on the stage without a script.
Join me in supporting Help defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris via
These are the asshole who will also say "that was Obama, Biden had nothing to do about it" when we point at economic growth, etc.
Why this conversation period.  Not once has anyone questioned the “whiteness” of Joe Biden or the “orangeness” of trump.  Please talk about the issues:  Covid-19, healthcare.
Joe Biden was refused communion. He is in complete rebellion. Without acknowledging, confessing and repenting he will remain in rebellion. So at best, he is a luke-warm, rebellious Catholic by name only. You know what the Bible says about being ‘luke-warm’: Rev 3:16 🔥
Kamala was already announced as the first Indian woman to compete in major election? 🤔 Her  family was major slave owners in ‘Brown Town’😡. She called Biden a racist, segregationist and believed his sexual harassment accuser 😮. Make up yalls mind 🤷🏻‍♀️.
Dismembering and sacrificing human beings will never be ok. Joe Biden must repent and the Catholic Church must take a stand. God will not be mocked.
To say Joe Biden is Catholic is to say that God and the Church have changed their mind about abortion. That hasn’t happened.
Except Biden’s support of abortion.
Along with my rant from previous tweets, America is seeing the largest wage gap between the top 1% and working class since the French revolution.... Neither Trump or Biden will do anything substantial to fix that. IDC if these CEO billionaires “worked hard to get where they are”
We need more people of the working class in office. We need more people of the millennial generation in office. Stop voting legacy politicians into office. They have never cared about anyone but themselves, their pockets, and their big corporations. Biden ain’t anything special
Y'all. Donald Trump has a racism, narcissism, sexism, and tax fraud problem. His fan base has a racism problem. Stop falling for his bullshit. Biden absolutely needs to right a lot of wrongs, but thinking Captain Cheetoh is better? Embarrassing.
She believes Biden’s accuser but accepts his VP nomination: such sincerity😏
I think Trump has been triggered because an amazing Black Woman named Kamala Harris was Biden's VP pick. So instead of being triggered of the 160,00 people that died under his and the accomplices negligence,They going nuts over Biden's VP pick! Everyone already knows time it is!
“She is also the first Democratic presidential or vice-presidential nominee from west of Texas”
I was a big Julián Castro Supporter. Was hoping to see his name in the mix, but this is an extremely electable ticket. Biden knee what he was doing.
the media just don't get it the person you force on us NEVER WIN!! Kamala Harris isn't going to bring the Black Voters out unless she changes some political views! We're not impressed with Good looks Anymore sorry Biden 🤷🏾‍♂️
What pisses me off is the economy under Trump made life good for Biden, Harris and most of the wealthy Dems. Not to mention more work for those so inclined. Unemployed got a raise. And they still wanna tear this house down. Lunacy! Pure Lunacy
I love this so much! Taking back our country’s soul! Biden/Harris 2020
i AM voting for biden however i will continue to complain abt him &amp; the other one girl!!! i complain every day of my damn life why would this be any different.....
- Biden was Vice President when a man was executed by a firing squad in 2010.   - Biden Was the Senator of Delaware when a Delaware man was executed by hanging in 1996.
Even #BLM founder Shaun King, thinks Joe Biden's a moron. Yet, they want him to have Nuclear Codes?! 😳
Normally everyone. But we're talking about Joe Biden.
So you CAN sleep your way up the ladder. Sara Palin earned her stripes the normal way. Yeah I know this is controversial but I heard her trash Biden till she dropped out. Wonder if HE did. Apparently it doesn’t matter to him.
Somehow I knew Joe Biden was gonna pick Kamala Harris as VP and Trump reacted by calling her "Nasty" &amp; "Phony Kamala" but it also seems he didn't like the VP choice too! Trump fears strong women,No matter what tricks he pulls everyone already can see through him like a laserbeam!
Daryl, if you are voting for Biden then we are the same “us.”
Something that I’ve learned in the past 4 yrs is that the candidate or even the platform isn’t the end game of politics. The candidate is the beginning and then you work to ensure that they support the policies you want. That being said, I am ready to vote Biden/Harris on Nov 3rd
Guess this makes them full of shit #Biden #Harris #Hypocrite #Lying
The #DemocraticParty presents SNIFF &amp; BLOW 👃 🍆  #Biden #Harris #SniffAndBlow2020
I can only speak for myself, but I don’t like that she’s been known to turn her back on the black community, her own community, as soon as it proves to be convenient. I’ll still be voting for her and Biden but that’s just one thing that rubs me the wrong way.
Was that before or after your son, Hunter Biden, was given a lucrative job with Burisma in Ukraine (without any experience) in an effort to get you to put pressure on their prosecution...which you did?
Biden picks Kamala Harris, his former 2020 rival, to be his vice-presidential running mate  via
Theirs will be interesting but they will actually formulate a debate. Trump and Biden will literally just be pulling stuff out of their ass and stumbling all over themselves and each other trying to get a cohesive argument out 😂
All I know is trump vs Biden debate will  be the most ridiculous thing we may have ever witnessed leading up to an election.
Rose Twitter explaining how a vote for Biden doesn’t count for shit in a red state but a vote for (who?) would? Lmao, hun. Log off.
Have you looked at Biden’s platform for 2020?
We want to see Americans stop dying from the Trump virus.  So I guess we don't always get what we want.  Biden will actually do something about the important issues.
Women of All races will take this team to the White House And we will Gladly kick Trump out if needed.  Mothers. Grandparents,  sisters and daughters voting Biden Harris on November 3rd.
i dont give a rat’s ass who biden’s running mate is. ive never voted in my life and will happily be voting for  for re-election!! i will be doing it in person too... no mail in voting for me.
I feel a BLUE WAVE coming on November 3rd.  We Will Vote Biden Harris to lead this country out of Trumps mess Looking for a Brighter tomorrow.
joe biden said “decades of Black female abolitionists’ blood, sweat, and tears gaining a spoonful of the mainstream recognition they deserve? yeah, let’s undermine that, but it’s okay she’s Black” and white liberals who were saying defund the police yesterday are nutting
Has Dirty Donny thought up some new bad names to call team Biden and Harris.  I've got some great names you can use,  how about Winners. Vote Biden November 3rd.
Biden and Harris will be a great team to have in the White House. Time to get good decent smart people back in charge.  Can't wait to vote on November 3rd.
talking about candidates on this website (tm) is a bad time, but I appreciated Kamala absolutely dicing Biden during the debates &amp; him having the wherewithal to be like "yeah, I need her on my team"
President Obama notes, thusly, “Joe Biden nailed this decision.”
2/2 choice if Biden wanted to focus on domestic policy and sure up a progressive base. With all of that said, Kamala Harris will be a better Vice President than US AG. I believe Rice for Sec. of State and I hope we find the political will to win the senate and make Warren leader
The Obama folks from ‘08 get all the fame, a podcast, tee shirts and the like. And much of that is deserved. But this Biden team, many of them old hands in Washington, has bested even the Pod Bros.
Let me be clear, I think Kamala Harris is the wrong choice for VP because of her “tough on crime” tenure as an AG in California. I thought Susan Rice was a much better choice if Biden felt like rebuilding international relations and obligations. I thought Warren was the better 1/
“And that little girl was me”!
Don't say If, say When she's elected. Team Biden Harris all the way.  I will personally skip mail in voting.  I want to cast the vote in person.
My friends and family keep blowing up my phone with this great news.  This was my pick 3 months back. Biden Harris ticket WILL make America Great Again.
is on it: Biden/Harris is the America we believe in.

The Biden seem to be the one's in China's pocket these days. As Nancy said, China would like it better if Biden was president.
Didn’t Kamala Harris call Biden a segregationist like 8 months ago?
Thank Biden for going through and picking a woman for your running mate! We see you! ❤️
Senator Harris is a Great pick. Can't wait to vote for the Biden  Harris ticket in November.
Joe Biden just lost y'all can stop trying to sell Kamala Harris. Black Women Don't even like her at all!!
Excited about Harris for VP for Joe Biden,  Senior Harris will make a great VP. GREAT NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS.  TEAM Biden and Harris all the way to the White House,
Jim Clyburn — in many ways the architect of Joe Biden’s revived campaign — says the Biden pick is “breaking new ground” on  “This is a big, big step.”
It's ok Luke, I just heard about a $350,000 Biden/Harris/Ohio State parlay.
Joe Biden Black Women Don't like this woman At All!! 🤷🏾‍♂️
All aboard the Biden-Harris Amtrak train
Congratulations to Kamala Harris on being Joe Biden’s  VP pick
Biden and Harris will give a joint speech tomorrow in Wilmington, we hear.
Joe Biden the day after the election
is the perfect VP pick for the Biden campaign. Let’s get to work and get them into the White House!
Kamala Harris is just Joe Biden in a lightskin black woman swatch. Take that how you will. But that’s my feelings on this situation.
Lmaooo Biden was racist a couple months ago according to Kamala Harris. Now that she’d become president if he’s elected he’s not bad
Biden/Harris sounds more appealing than the Trump/Pence "the country we lead now is a disaster...elect us again to fix it"
And if Biden’s smart, he’s gonna go into every Southern state and loudly and openly blame Trump for it happening.
Stop worrying about football and solve the virus and the American economy depression.  This Is Your Dam Job.  Biden will have to do it when he becomes president.
It is NOT about the networks. It is about Trump claiming victory in every state he leads on election night and saying its Fraud when Biden wins due to mail ins. Dems need to make sure mail ins will be counted by election night or emphasize IN PERSON EARLY VOTING
I guess from his politics, Biden believes the world better by killing the unborn...up to the day of delivery. Scripture is clear, God is the author of life. Woe be to those who oppose the Creator of life!
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. just sent me an email entitled “re: our historic announcement” and it’s not even about his VP selection⁉️ Sir.
Something we don’t think about often enough is just how awful the 2016 Clinton campaign was at appearances and visuals, as demonstrated in this graf from today’s Times convention write-up.  Biden is running 6-7 points ahead of Hillary due, in large part, to this fact.
... Biden is gunna starve in America.
I hate Joe Biden as much as the next guy, but who in their right mind would turn down the opportunity to be the second most powerful person in the fucking world, are y’all crazy.? Y’all just really hate black women, huh?
Joe Biden is a life long liar.
In 2010 Under Biden &amp; Obama, Ronnie Lee Gardner was Executed by a firing Squad.
Could be bad news for Biden. He’s been known to do that too.
Is he a women now? Be a bad look for Biden to say he was gonna pick a women and then didn’t.
. and  report Biden’s pick may come as early as tomorrow.
Biden and Pelosi have been in Politics for almost half a century. All of a Sudden they about to build America back better.
I just saw where Trump out-fund-raised Biden by $25 mil last month. This isn’t the first election cycle I have thought this..but why do we spend so much money on elections? (I know the answer - my q is rhetorical). Those millions could be spent feeding the hungry, helping the...
This man just got re elected, the ball is in your court Biden
Our local ICUs has more people on vents several years ago during Swine/H1N1 Flu (under Obamacare/Biden) than we do now.  Who’s to blame there? Did we shut the country down? Answer:Obama and No.
Trump is a Liar and he hopes we don't notice.  I may not be able to afford his 350 thousand admission fees for his private club, but my vote is just as valuable as any of his Rich friends.  I Will use my vote elect Biden for president on November 3rd.
Where’s the Biden one???😏
So Obama and Biden were in office for 8 years and Biden 2 brain aneurysms ??? Not 1 but 2 ????
But you’ll still see me “at the polls” voting for Joe Biden.  (Well, actually I’ll probs mail in cause #thisisAmerica &amp; it’s dangerous out there 😏)
Her and Biden both have lost it. I mean the ability to speak clearly, think like an American, and last but not least, ACT  like one

Joe Biden has a plan? Funny
Biden the groper
Yes but Biden bothers me deeply that he’s not in jail for bribery and treason and many other charges for him and his stupid son and all their money seized That this pedophil and sexual assaulter is even running4leader of the free world makes me nauseaous!He’s dispicable&amp;acrook
Obama didn't trust Joe Biden with H1N1. After Joe went on late night tv and scared America Obama cut Joe off
Clyburn, who is a deeply compromised individual, was instrumental in making the centrist Joe Biden the Democratic nominee instead of a true progressive.
Hunter Biden is hit with $450K Tax Liens, but it gets resolved even though he has ‘No Discernible Income.’ Biden Campaign Silent 😡
Only if Biden does too.
But he is WRONG this time.
Thats literally what Trump read, but he didn’t say it. Bc it doesn’t fit his “Biden hates America” narrative. I’m sure you have access to google.
Challenge: Compare what Biden has ever actually DONE for black Americans in his 44 years of holding political office to Trump’s accomplishments in just 3.5 years, all while met with fierce resistance by Dems at every step!
So Iran&amp;China hate Trump&amp;are meddling in our election&amp;trying to elect Biden?That right there!!That right there!! should make you rush RUSH ASAP 2Vote4 Trump! These Iranian&amp;Commie Chinese hate us Hate AnericaThey are enemies2your freedom! #Vote4Trump #Trump2020 #Vote4FreedomTrump

Why do you list Joe Biden first?
We must get trump OUT. The only way to do that is vote for BIDEN. Period. One of those 2 will be president.
For BIDEN. Unless you want another 4 years of trump.
Love the ads. Keep up the good work.  Vote Biden 2020
Let’s get our country back? Hell, y’all had it for more than three years!! What did y’all do with it?? Y’all lost it believing this liar!! Look at where you are today; is your America Great Again? HELL NO! And it won’t be for a long time. Biden will get us out of this hell hole!!
The Sanders wing has scored a lot of victories in the Democratic platform—but didn’t get all it wanted on Israel.
Maybe he didn't listen to it, he just felt like it was patriotic at first and sent it. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe he did it on purpose. He has literally never made disparaging remarks toward the black community. Ever. Joe Biden is awful.Afraid to take on Biden on the up and up. He's afraid to make personnel decisions in person.  Sensing a pattern.
Biden solves #COVID_19
Need any more evidence of Biden’s deminished mental ability. Has anyone ever shopped for a book by not examining the cover and inside first?  And then he grabs a handful. === Blown Photo op.
As usual Biden is lying. An absentee ballot is as different from a mail in ballot as an honest Republican President ( example “ HonestAbe) is from any dishonest Dim President ( Obama “ you can keep your Dr”) .

It’s not true that Biden did nothing as Obama’s VP. “Sleepy Joe” made a number of members of his immediate and extended family rich. Hunter got $1.5 Billion out of the Chinese Communist Party in just one trip to China with Daddy, for example.
Joe Biden called someone a “lying dog face pony soldier” and I don’t know how to feel about it
All you’re doing is saying Biden is working harder to become president.

What would the impact of a Biden-Harris win be on US India relations?  The media often underplays the fact that Biden’s vice presidential pick has an Indian mother. Her heritage could play a crucial role in U.S. foreign…
Do y’all think anyone’s told Biden that Kamala Harris is the VP pick?
If you put a gun to my head and forced me to vote for Biden or Trump, I'm voting for Trump. Not because I think he's an effective leader, or a trustworthy individual, or a good communicator, or that I even like him as a person, but BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING A FUCKING GUN TO MY HEAD.
Kind of like my Neighbor that had a Republican for Biden sign with my Trump Sticker I put on it. I noticed this Morning his sign is gone. That’s why you don’t put Stupid Blue Shit up in a Red Area.
Well that's kind of a problem since Project Lincoln has already pledged to support Biden's agenda in office.
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
Great VP choice Biden couldn’t do any better
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won’t this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more “progressive” outcomes than a Biden one. That’s likely more scary to me than you, but that’s where I’m coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is “all there.” Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden’s mental acuity. I don’t think it’s just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she’d be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that’s a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of “this progressive moment.” I’m going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Trump’s pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn’t care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
Y’all do realize it’s either Trump or Biden.. right.. fucking vote blue.
Won't matter what Biden does the virus will magically disappear nov 4th
Excited about Biden-Harris ticket. Sounds like Trump is afraid of her. He does not handle a smart, talented, assertive woman well. His misogyny will rear its ugly head. His paranoia and sadism will be activated.
Please be right. What a nightmare to think of creepy sleazy biden and legs up harris winning

Social Security is funded by payroll taxes. Trump said he’s eliminating payroll taxes if re-elected. Most people don’t understand FICA and just see the deduction on their check not realizing it funds their Social Security. So Biden’s not lying.
With all the new federal mandates a unified democratic government will pass, Biden will need someone to jail all those who don’t comply
So if Biden is elected, the Democrats will make it all go away?
And it’s a horrendously bad idea. Give opponents a long list of targets, each with some distracting controversy. Appoint too many liberals and turn off the moderates. Appointment too many moderates and turn off the progressives.Biden doesn’t need a risky gimmick.

The Democrats don’t want Trump to accept his nomination from the WH, so I think Gettysburg is the perfect place. Will they complain about that? I guess Biden will accept from his basement.

I would have advised that Biden’s thinking process could have been better.

Yeah, China wants Biden to win so he can dominate the US again.
Biden disproportionately weakened the black nuclear family through laws he sponsored . Trump has tweeted so many things that have been questionable. I appreciate your taking the time to respond. #antiracism
2/2 one law that treated crack cocaine as significantly worse than powder cocaine and ended up disproportionately punishing African Americans. Biden’s 1994 omnibus anti-crime law is blamed for accelerating incarceration rates, especially of black men.
1/1 I hear you. I think they’re 2 diff heads of same snake. Biden just gets a pass and he has written laws that have absolutely devastated black families.
Not a defender of Trump. Some things you cannot defend ..Just curious do your tweets mean you’re a Biden supporter ?
Also that Biden doesn't even know it's been released, let alone had anything to do with writing, you know, the, the thing.
Trump says he will fight for ALL American citizens to have prosperity and security. Biden just talks about the blacks.

One consolation of a (hypothetical) Biden presidency will be the press having to play janitor for whatever Joe vomits out.  Nothing they can take inspiration from like with Obama, just endless "what he really said/meant was..."  They're going to be so depressed by 2024.
In order to support and vote for Biden, a documented racist at his core, they end up condoning and propagating racism with that support! - Stephen Fuller
Biden’s racism has ALWAYS been there. It’s apart of his core as a man. Yet, the Democrats continue to give him a pass! By doing so, the Democrats simply are not credible , their arguments are not valid, and they lack any standing in any serious discussion about racism.
If Biden is incapable of debating or knows he is incapable and afraid, how about at least have 3 rads (Dems) vs 3 conservatives ( Republicans) on stage for 2 hours and debate 5 major issues predetermined by national polls. 1/2POTUS made his press briefing in Washington on time, if you only paid attention to them. Here is your Communist trying to babble from his hideout. Thinks he's in his sister's basement. Biden doesn't know his sister from his wife. Commies will pull him, watch.
In a world that sees Biden become President, I’d much rather  be a perpetual &amp; belligerent thorn prodding Biden in the side from the left in the Senate.
One of the best moves Trump could do to rattle Biden is pardon Snowden and invite him to a debate. 😂😂
OK so what if biden made a deal with trump to just get in office and ruin every possible thing he could so that he could run against him in the 2020 election and people would settle for him because we NEED to get trump outta office and it’s all a big conspiracy
and when Joe Biden actually took action on Corona virus, he took the wrong action. He encouraged people to vote in person, if they were feeling healthy. This went against CDC guidelines.

So Biden would reverse Trump’s reversals of Obama’s actions?
Let me be clear on this.   The Trump Campaign will not attack Joe Biden as much now. They will turn their attacks on Kamala Harris. This camp sees her as a dangerous threat and will treat her like she is the one leading the ticket. Mark my words.   KHive, let’s get to work.
This must mean   must be the one paying out of her own pocket. She may be too busy on her knees to campaign. Maybe Wang has bought her like he did Biden with the 1.5 billion. Jamaica could use the money from Harris.

My point it that we have to focus on getting them in. We can do that AND address their shortcomings, but getting them in is priority 1. Obama wasn’t progressive but we made progress on which, with Biden, we can build on. Was it everything, no. But it was a good step.
Biden should debate when Trump produces his Tax returns
I won’t argue that slow progress can is frustrating. But we are making slow progress and we need to keep at it. We cannot allow further regression from the Trump administration. We have no hope of progress with them. At least with Biden and Harris, we’ve got a shot.
I understand why it’s hard to vote for Biden and Harris.   I also know we will all perish if he stays in office.  So, can we just, all, like, collectively  agree to live longer?  I beg.

Can someone give me a good detailed reason on why they will vote Biden and Harris
And y’all wanna vote for Kanye because Biden/Harris is “gonna put everyone in jail”. #wakeup
Add all of this with Biden's baggage and I have less of reason to vote for Biden.
Hunter and joe Biden ?
I’m confused at why it’s ok to be ignorant of what’s she done just because she’s black. Even if we vote for Biden/Harris don’t we have a right to be informed about who’s being put in office? People are ok with any standard now and that’s scary
Well...Kamala embraced Willie’s willie. But did CNN have a headline about that? “Biden picks Kamala Harris, who previously had an affair with the married Mayor of SF and slept her way to the top”
This video alone will cause Biden and Harris to lose
Interestingly enough, neither #BlackLivesMatter or #MeToo have anything to say about Kamala Barris or Joe Biden.....   I woulda thought "believing Biden's accusers, and being descended from a slave owning family, would've stirred some sort of emotional reaction
Excited about a Biden / Harris ticket !!
I think we get him elected and then push. His policy/action is superior to Trump’s in every way, so I think the focus right now needs to get Biden elected. Then I think we can press hard for progress. Not ideal, but the alternative is Trump.
Oh I have no issues with criticizing the left people. None at all. I just think that we also need to, despite those criticisms, encourage people to vote for him. Biden wasn’t my choice at all. Neither was Harris. But this ticket can win and we need to support it.
Also biden and kamala proves the democrats are still not listening, still don't give a fuck about progress and will absolutely let the entire country burn go keep that status quo. Bc those 2 don't give a damn about no change man lol
- you publicly stated you believed and supported the women who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault - now you are with him?? You also said he was a racist?? Should call you "QUEEN FLIP FLOPP" - anything for power - right girl?
I will not be voting for Biden (nor Trump) in this presidential election. The DNC has let us know for the last time that they don't give a crap what their constituents or the US want by selecting Kamala Harris as the VP pick. I know when to get out of an abusive relationship.
You're not selling me on Biden, if that's your goal. I am voting Green b/c they are offering Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and substantive criminal justice reform like reallocating police funds to community funds. To convince me to vote D, offer the same or better.
A president should have judgement, Biden exhibited failed judgement in this crucial moment. That's all.
I’m so very happy! Biden-Harris is a winning combination and you can see that the GOP are terrified! It’s glorious to watch them squirm. They all need to wear diapers now.
I think it's important to ask ourselves why we, as individuals, feel the former is futile. Consider when you have ever met an enthusiastic Joe Biden voter. Consider that ~40% of the eligible voters stayed home in the 2016 general. Is it math? Or is it something else?
Yes to optics.  I don't care for a lot of Harris' positions, but she's better than Palin.  Minimally when ABC interviews her, it won't be a train wreck.  And did Biden ever have a younger base?  Was anyone of any age ever excited about his run?
Mr. Biden would like to have a word with you, Bishop.
Well, Harris is aligned with most of Biden's positions, it's just that being a centrist is uninspiring, arguably unethical, and clearly not what any of us wanted. But yeah no reform for us.
No.  Joe Biden voted for the Iraq war, voted for NAFTA, and authored the racist crime bill. Kamala Harris positively laughed at the thought of locking up the parents of truant children and fought to make sure that evidence that would free an innocent man was kept hidden.
Depending on the polls. If close, will hold my nose &amp; vote Biden/Harris. If not, will vote Green or do a write-in. Will try &amp; focus on who to vote for down-ballot. Priority is now non-electoral politics.
On top of just accusing Biden of being racist, rapist, and pro-segregation just a few months ago? Lmao that shit is hilarious
So? Debate skills are not necessary as evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden to achieve where they are now. There will be so many more rules in this debate not like the unstructured &amp; lopsided DNC debates.
Trump is gonna kick his old wrinkley butt. Its a joke actually. Compare them really. Its a no brainer. Biden is history. No one I mean no one in their right mind will vote for him. There is not that many stupid people here in the US. Its getting close but no.
It’s an of guard picture, taken at the right moment and no context, used by a lot of trolls and bots to try and discredit Joe Biden. They been doing this since Obama was pres. Heres one of Trump with his preteen daughter looking like she’s twerking on him
Ha ha, she was chosen by the DNC and Biden had to play along. She’s full of crap just like him. They pander to anyone for a vote.
Trump is a racist joe Biden is a little less racist - y’all
All right, ready to convince the first person... joe Biden?! Uh oh.
Biden actually needs our votes and elected to nominate a “tough-on-crime” DA in the midst of protests for police accountability. You think he’ll care once he’s in power?
It riles up the base and it informs those who are politically ignorant because they don’t pay any attention that Biden is a racist, which they may or may not care about.   This won’t change the minds of liberals who were OK with him raping a woman though.
LoL actually Trump and Barr would just write up a report that said Democrats interfered in the election because China and 🙈 [I’m just gonna pick another] Iran wanted Biden to win and would launch an investigation into that and hold hearings and appoint US attorneys etc.
If Wall Street is glad Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris, where does that put all of the leftist "occupy Wall Street" folks?
Where's #MeToo now that Joe Biden is the Presidential Nominee?  Will Madonna want to blow up the WH if he wins?
Good so we agree that Biden is creepy. Better than being a confirmed rapist I guess.
All you need to know about Kamala Harris  1) Believed Biden's accusers 2) Called Biden out for supporting segregation when she was in school 3) Is descended from a slave owning family 4) The pilot of AF2 will radio the tower with "heels up" when taking off
How Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris: Inside the history-making VP pick
Don’t forget about the batshit Barr report about Biden’s son or something that will drop in October!
Sounds like 2012. But it was for Paul Ryan. And his VP opponent? Biden. And Biden "won" that debate.
I wonder: What will the Dems and Biden/Harris do if/when Trump attacks them from the left?
Photo Gallery: Meet Biden’s VP choice Kamala Harris
So define success for a guy like Joe Biden? Is he successful? Is it because he was elected each time? You don’t know Trump or Biden personally you just hate or love because someone told you to.  Be honest with yourself. What policies are you for or is orange man bad enough?
Regardless of how you feel about Biden, we need to vote for Biden because the next president will replace RBG. We don’t want another Brett Kavanaugh.
Harris will be the end of Biden's campaign. Like when McCain picked Sarah Pailin
Unlikable Biden just picked one of the least likeable presidential candidates that democrats didn't even pick for the nomination, and now you want us to believe this is the winning ticket?🤣🤣🤣 get the fuqouttahea!
&lt;shiver&gt;   And I’m arguing with a black dude in the military right now saying he’s voting for Kanye and fuck Joe Biden because his portfolio has been constantly increasing.
It's still true. I'm not going to pretend that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are something that they're not. They're not progressive, they're not for the people, they're not an inspiration, they're a stop-gap. I voted Democrat for the last time; I won't be doing it again.
Ok..... But she's the VP pick. Biden does not oppose fracking.
Even Biden himself is doing it, the you ain’t Black comment for example - More Black people would be willing to vote for him if he had simply said nothing at all than trying to shame or guilt them into supporting him.   People really dont like being told they have no choice Lol
I think its about the fence, people can hate Trump, but having your own community treat you like youre dumb if you dont 100% agree or you dont see Biden as much better, or any opinion that isnt get Trump out at all costs - those are votes that could be had if they werent off put
Mr. Terrell, thank you for sharing your view about Biden's running mate.
If you vote for Biden, you support a racist segregationist.....  If you accept the nomination from a racist segregationist, you're desperate
Politics is all about persuasion though, and the way some of your tweets come off may make people want to double down on how they feel about Biden and Harris.   It lends itself to the same feelings of hopelessness and lack of choice that cause people not to bother voting at all
When I think of all the great people Biden/Harris have to choose from when replacing Trumps cronies, i get giddy with joy!   Warren, Beto, Buttigieg, Abrams, Col. Vindman, Yovanovitch, and more!
These replies treating Kamala like Paul Ryan in 2012(v Biden btw, who actually won that debate) even though we seen Tulsi already drag Kamala on a debate stage this year.
Maybe educate yourself on what the "National Debt" actually is.  44 increased the ND over 10 trillion, much of that became laundered money to elites. 44 and certain people in Congress were given millions. Thats how Biden got his millions.
Hey leftists form a real opinion instead of telling us what you heard about on the news Trumps not racist but Joe Biden and kamala Harris both are racist and flip floppy morons don't believe me I encourage you to look it all up yourself there's plenty of documentation 😉
Taylor Swift is out here telling people about Biden unifying America, when literally every song she sings is about a guy who won’t unify with her.   And my wife will confirm, I don’t dislike her music. I just find it ironic.
Talk yo shit but remember this Biden/Harris ticket is what we voting for come November.
Obama &amp; Biden were Spying &amp; Lying. #MAGA2020Landslide #TrumpPence2020
Biden can not come out at night. Dementia,Sundowners Syndrome cause behaviors to escalate, such as mood changes, anger, crying, fear and wandering. Sundowning is thought to be triggered by fading light. The symptoms can get worse as the night goes on and usually better by morning
Can't Wait for Kamala to make "MinceMeat" of Phoney Mike in a debate.   #returnsanityvoteJoe
It is not up to Biden. DNC only is interested in corporate donors and big dark money.
Kamala Harris just single handedly changed the slogan from "Ridin with Biden" to "Ridin Biden"
So you’ve finally come to terms with the truth about Biden.
If the country wanted a black woman for president then Joe Biden wouldn’t have won the democratic primary 🤔.  She isn’t qualified. This should be entertaining
How are we supposed to believe anything Kamala says if she can't even stand by her own statements that Joe Biden is a racist sexual predator?
Of course joe Biden would pick the fucking cop as his running mate.
I think Biden knows he doesn’t stand chance so he picked a Non starter
Ryan Knight is actually looking out for the people, which is more than Crime Bill Biden and Cop Kamala can say. Let's not try to rewrite history here. Biden is racist and has shown that many times, and Kamala isn't much better. They're better than Trump, and that's it.
Imagine all this shit with police and protests and riots happening and then Biden “chooses” Kamala Harris that was Indian-American and now is African American to be VP...... the Democrats cannot get more stupid.
I may vote for Biden/Kamala, but I foolishly hope her earlier criticisms of Biden about racism and sexually predatory behavior were sincere. These are issues affecting everyday lives, and it just kinda seems like it was reduced to a political attack.
Today is a horrible day for the USA.  was added to  crazy ticket.  Folks, if you vote these two into office your next president won’t be Joe Biden...it’s a vote for #kamala because Biden is mentally compromised.  #VoteTrump2020
I do not think Biden would be a good President.
Ordered my yard sign and a bunch of other Biden/Harris swag, not that my neighbors have any doubts with the  yard sign and the  bumper sticker. Gotta make a bold statement when you're a blue voter in Alabama!
Completely agree with the Senate races. However, as an Alabama voter, what incentive do I have to vote for Biden/Harris?
She believes Biden’s sexual assault accusers but happily joins him as his running mate. She has zero morals and would blow anyone to further her career.
Thank you Team Joe and the Biden Camp for making this happen. Now that you have us, we’re going to the White House. 💛🐝💛
In one sentence you complain about Kamala being disrespectful to Joe Biden, and in the same sentence you call him”sleepy joe.” Projection anyone? Can you say misogyny?
This. Warren was my top pick for the Democratic ticket but you know what? She was one among many who would make a great President. So I’ll be proud to support the Biden/Harris ticket and in the future Harris for President. Let’s #SaveTheRepublic and vote #BidenHarris2020 Nov 3rd!
I love Warren, but Harris is a solid pick, and I'm going to hang my Biden/Harris shirt next to my Persist shirt and wear the heck out of both. If Warren could be gracious and supportive today so can everybody else.
Jill Biden picks Kamala Harris as VP. There, fixed it for you.
Biden never had a chance in the first place between his comments on black people and Trump
In an effort to even the playing field, Barron Trump will debate Joe Biden
So Biden/Harris is worse than Trump/Pence????  I’m willing to listening!  No one has ever explained it to me so please inform me so I won’t be confused.
I don’t know what is happening locally in Seattle. So you’ll have to discuss that with someone familiar with that overall. In any case, it doesn’t matter. It still doesn’t change the fact that we need to elect Biden.
Democrats know their constituents have the attention span of a gnat, so remembering something like this will definitely be forgotten
I’m not voting for Biden, but every time I see a Republican claim that Biden/Hariis is far-left, it makes me want to vote for them a tad bit more than I previously did...
I don’t want any gear with Biden’s name on it.   Just put K A M A L A across the chest on a fitted black tee, pls.
Serious question didn’t she come out and say we must believe the sexual assault accusations made by Mr. Biden’s accuser. Something about women must be believed. Just wondering what changed her mind so fast
Legitimately, probably Warren, who’s CFPB plan Biden also fought 😔
Biden just really solidified his win by choosing Kamala 😂
So what KH debates better. Do debates really count??? As evidenced by Trump &amp; Biden
Also, Biden himself has hinted at being a one-termer and anointing his VP as future leader of the party, so while it might have mattered less before, this one is much more determinant.
I believe the effect will be neutral in votes. My point being - debates - so what? Trump &amp; Biden are not the best debaters - that quality did not get them in top spots. And so what if KH is a top notch debater? More security - could be in order...
More accurately, Biden found out today which running mate the DNC chose for him.
Liz Warren is so pissed right now. She raised 3 times of Kamala. All for Joe Biden to drool on himself.
So her accusing Biden of being racist and pro-segregation just doesn’t mean shit because she’s pro UBI... MAKE IT MAKE SENSE LMAO WEAK
In case you're wondering, YES, the Biden/Harris merch is already up on the campaign store, and YES I'm going to get some after dinner.  needs a t-shirt. :)
Aight here me out. Hard Knocks type show but following the speech writers for Biden’s campaign
All jokes aside, I seriously can’t think of two living people more responsible for the overcriminalization of disadvantaged minorities than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.   This ticket, with everything going on right now, is peak irony.   #KamalaHarrisForVP  #JoeBiden
I'm glad that's settled. Get me a yard sign for Biden AND Harris, and let's get on with winning the whole show in November. FIGHT FOR EVERY SEAT IN EVERY RACE IN EVERY STATE. Leave no GOP enabler in office.
But I don’t think it’s immediate. People have been not wanting her as a candidate and I’m not here for Biden at all. Will I still vote for them yes but I don’t think they are vastly different than a lot of the current administration, they just aren’t as loud or crass about it
Love this! Her theology must be vibrant and inclusive. She will be able to speak faith language to different groups of people. Good on Biden! Are you excited by this choice?
So if Biden is elected we will have to learn Chinese *and* French?  Cool.
She's Joe Biden's pick for Vice President. Who is Kamala Harris?

Harris is an excellent and smart choice in so many ways. This shows Biden is a fighter and is not afraid to build a strong team to lead this country. Harris challenged him and he stepped up and now they team up. Admirable!45 would have played the pity game cuz that’s his brand.
Way to go  !! You made an amazing choice. I can't wait to vote for a Biden/Harris ticket.
Joe Biden VP pick: Sen. Kamala Harris. Let’s get to work.
Don’t think Susan Rice won’t be in an active and visible role in a Biden administration.  State dept, probably.
Stacey Abrams was not picked for Joe Biden's running mate because....voter suppression!!!
Yeeeeeah this is when it gets murky, innit. Harris, Biden, Trump, and Pence have all done things that are morally/ socially/political unacceptable. I don't think any should be representative. Obviously some more than others. But we need change, and we won't get it immediately.
To be fair, that's pretty much exactly what they're saying about Biden too. Sounds like a couple of moderates to me.
Right now it’s about preventing further regression. The Trump admin is hellbent on stripping LGBTQ+ and women’s health rights. They are filling the SCOTUS and lower courts with conservative justices...this can have an impact for generations. We have to vote Biden.
How y’all feel about Kamala Harris as Biden running mate?
Yes, I don’t think Rice has an ambition to be president. That said I think she would make a good one since she is very smart and very tough. If Biden gets elected I have no doubt she will be appointed Secretary of State.
Wrong!  I know of NO women who favors Biden- Heels up Kamala- resume the position that got you were you are - you passed the sniff test- Don't blow it 👠👠👠👠🤣
Joe Biden clearly picked Kamala Harris as tribute to recently fallen pro wrestler Kamala. That is what I choose to believe.
Honestly, it can’t matter right now. We have to stop Trump. I know it’s frustrating, but we have to vote for Biden and encourage others to do so as well. The future of this country depends on it.

Being a one issue voter (defund police) is a bad idea. Similar to people who vote republican just because of abortion. You aren’t ever going to agree with everything, but Biden and Harris are clearly far more capable of managing our govt than the damn circus that’s there now.
Democratic Party Presidential Ticket! Biden/Harris Congratulations! #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris
You do understand that defunding does not mean eliminate police forces and take all of their money right? And getting Trump out is the MOST important thing. We cannot go on like this. It is unethical to do anything but vote for Biden.
I, personally, am very excited about Kamala Harris as VP, more excited than I was about Biden as president (tbh, I wasn’t all that excited, not at all).
If Joe Biden didn’t want me to vote  all that’s all he had to say.
Don’t be like this. I don’t think anyone is thrilled but we NEED Trump out of office. We can squabble about getting an ideal candidate next time. In Nov, it has to be Biden and Harris. Please just encourage voting, let’s get Trump out, and move forward.

Biden is counting on folks like you who are ill informed. Please dig deeper for the truth. I know it is difficult to find because the MSM is biased. The democrat party wants to send the innocent preborn to death and that is horrific.
Lee also trots out the socialist straw man but Biden and most Democrats are not socialists. If they were, Biden would not be the nominee.
🗣️A VOTE FOR BIDEN/HARRIS WILL=NO GUNS FULL TERM ABORTIONS DESTROY ECONOMY BECOME DEPENDANT FOR OIL AGAIN MEDICARE FOR ALL REMOVE OUR FAIR TRADE STOP BUILDING MILITARY DEFUND POLICE PUT CAR IND.OUT OF BUSINESS BUILD MORE ELECTRIC CARS OPEN BORDERS AND BUILD F""G WINDMILLS! KAG🇺🇸
Within minutes of the presumptive Democratic nominee's announcement Tuesday, false information was circulating on social media, claiming that Harris had called Biden a "racist" and that she is not eligible to be president.
BIDEN WILL NOT MAKE IT FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!!😱 HE'S ALREADY HAD A BRAIN STROKE! LOOK IN HIS EYES!
...the fact we have to pick between two different scum bags should say enough about the current state of our nation. A lot of people are supporting Biden just so Trump isn’t the president anymore, and I the homophobic and racist isn’t from the actual person but their policies.
Wow cannot believe Im about to have to block so many WHITE people for immediately being pieces of shit after Kamala was picked as the VP. Im all in for the Biden/Harris ticket
I mean, that’s a big reason why I personally don’t like Biden. So to say that the reasons he’s “demonized” are not based in truth is very shortsighted and letting your bias cloud your judgement. There are many legit reasons to dislike Biden, just like trump. More so for Trump tho
She’s so nasty, damn good choice. Until she dropped out she was getting this 69 year old southern white boys vote. I’m damned proud Joe picked her. Great choice!!!! She could be President and It shows Biden’s good judgement.
know Joe Biden ad sierra club.
Are you crazy.  He was not the one to get sued for housing discrimination you and your father were!!!! enough said . joe biden black voter not you!!!!!!
I applaud Shaun King for supporting Biden and Harris. Putting aside your personal feelings for the greater good (Defeating Trump) is what we all need.
From the start, some Biden advisers saw Harris as a logical choice. She was among the party's most popular figures, a deft debater and a fundraising juggernaut.
She’s going to bat for the idea that women are capable and qualified, not necessarily for Biden.
No centrist would want Biden or Trump. Honestly both are just serving their corporate donors and not the people.
I'll vote for trump or not at all tbh. I was grudgingly voting for Biden after he was picked by the DNC (not the american people) to be the nominee. Now Harris was only wanted by Wall Street, not voters.   Its shameful to think Biden will be any different from Trump as president.

Bernie lost the progressive vote as soon as he bent the knee for Biden and gave up everything he stood for.
Sadly they know that progressives will grudgingly vote Biden so they chose Harris specifically as a slap in the face to progressive views instead of shoring up the vote. They already know their eggs are in one basket and want to stomp out all the resistance to their corruption
Honestly if you are a progressive, neither Biden nor Trump will give you anything that you want and they want you to lose hope.
is very much against the people. The Kamala pick was also just another slap in the face to any progressive who tries to convince themselves that Biden is even a little bit forward thinking with the likes of Warren or Sanders whispering in his ear.
Thoughts on Kamala VP Pick: Biden is absolutely just a figure head with no real policies that he has other than whatever Wall street tells him to do. So with Kamala being his VP, her policy will ultimately dictate his. She has a shitty history from when she was a prosecutor &amp; 1/2
Kamala Harris, congratulations but how are you voting on take our guns away when blacks are killing blacks,#1 crime in America always to this day. You and Biden are a joke,leave our country and know what opressions about,from a white God Fearing loving man that despises you
Congrats on becoming Biden's running partner. #KamalaHarrisForVP
After reflection and a quick informal social media review concerning Biden's choice of Kamala Harris, I have determined that people who weren't going to vote for Biden still aren't and people who supported Biden still do.
So tell me Rick, you voting for Biden this year? Really? You are going to support a candidate who believes its ok to murder babies in the womb?
I need this $400 unemployment to start coming asap so I can buy Biden/Harris Masks, Bumper Stickers, and Yard Signs ASAP!
Kamala: I believe the survivors of Joe Biden  Also Kamala: ✨Joe Biden’s VP✨
Biden needs to watch his food and drinks...it would be just terrible if someone slipped him something...
Mama doesn’t like Pence being alone with women, so Biden can chaperone.
Not crazy about her but then I don't like anyone.  She was the obvious pick when Biden said he would pick a minority woman. Her primary performance was underwhelming, she won't add her state to Biden column, but she will help secure black voters and progressives.
Congratulations President Trump™ on Candidate Joe Biden's© naming of Kamala Harris® as V.P. pick.
He legit thinks they just named Kamala from the 80s WWF as Biden's VP.  Also, apropos of nothing, my phone tried to change Biden to Vixen, so I think my phone is drunk.
I’m excited for Kamala Harris. Biden is still CREEPY AF but I’ll take my chance with him.
That's exactly what the debate will be like...Biden will be given the questions and his staff will put the answers on cue cards!!!
Ronna, I truly don't believe Biden could make it for 4 years!! I'm serious!
🤔Well, Well, Well, between Biden saying "they gonna  put y'all back  in chains" and Kamala changing the way she speaks in front of black audiences, We have a COMPLETE RACISTS COCKTAIL!!😱😂😂😂
Fox news has been a platform for the democrats ALL DAY!! Democrats don't have enough guts to admit Biden is incompetent!!
BREAKING on #VP choice:  selects CA Senator  as his running mate. #KamalaHarris is the 1st black woman to compete on a major party’s presidential ticket.
Do you agree with Biden's choice of running mate? More details. &gt;&gt;&gt;
I couldn’t be happier!! She’s gonna be great VP. Damned proud of Biden
Seriously tho, Kamala Harris? The woman that has made a fucking fortune on the false imprisonments of minorities? The woman that has “backed the blue” since it was a “stance”. This is who everyone is proud of Joe Biden for picking? YGMFU.
LMFAOOOO Joe Biden picked Kamala Harris as his VP. 🤮🤮🤮. It’s like he’s screaming “AJ don’t vote for me”. DONT FUCKING WORRY
Joe Biden names Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman on a major party’s presidential ticket
i came to see what y’all had to say bout biden/harris 🤣
Does joe Biden know?
So she will run the country if they're elected. We all know Biden can't do it.
Joe Biden has just named Kamala Harris as his VP running mate. Now it’s time to really work and get this man to stop raging crazy stuff end get him in that White House
Love the Biden - Harris ticket. You have my vote and financial support. 👍🏿
JUST IN: Joe Biden has decided on his running mate: Sen. Kamala Harris.
Democrats close to the campaign say an announcement is imminent, and could come as early as Tuesday.
More accurately, Joe Biden’s handlers tell him they have chosen a running mate for him
I would put nothing past Joe Biden, including that he's a sasquatch with a good waxing regimen.
FLASHBACK: Robin Williams Rips ‘Ramblin’ Joe Biden, ‘Come Here Joe, Sit ...
Amen. John Kasich is a damned Patriot. The real deal. The only true Republican left that doesn’t call themselves “former” . God bless him. We need a strong second party. I pray President Biden builds a bipartisan cabinet and really tries to heal our country from the bitterness.
Yep but every time he speaks it’s another Biden campaign ad
You got it all wrong. Biden goes to the basement and stays. Trump was whisked away but came back to finish Biden just stays in the basement and waits for the sky to fall
Of course they prefer Biden. Puppet.
Yeah if the league of women voters wasn’t good enough for you I didn’t think that would be I’m beginning to think that the only source you’ll accept is Joe Biden’s website
Have you heard the way Biden talks about children?
The more we talk the more I think you’re just here to push people away from Biden and towards Trump
Yeah well no he doesn’t shows your lack of research
Biden lost the candidacy in 2016 to a person who then lost to Trump its hugely egotistical of him for un and steal votes from Jo. You see how that logic works out?
1. She gets into the debates and destroys Trump and Biden and wins in a landslide
How have I shown this by not voting for Biden?
I’m not trying to rationalize anything I think you’re mad because there’s a candidate better than Biden
Biden and Trump are and I support neither
No you’re right but continuing corporate subsidies, continuing the war in the Middle East, gun control, continuing the war on drugs, continuing the militarization of the police and many other things are impossible enough for me to not vote for Biden or Trump
Mathematically she can though she’s on enough ballots to hit 270 so let’s get her on the debate stage then Trump and Biden can prove why they are the better candidate
You keep saying that but ya know I just don’t believe it maybe you should keep repeating it over and over instead of providing a reason for me to vote for Biden other than he’s not Trump
I wouldn’t vote for Biden anyways I’m not siphoning votes from anyone and if you believe I am then you’re admitting that Jo’s policies are better than Biden’s but #BlueNoMatterWho ammiright
And it’s not supporting trump because Biden and nobody else is entitled to your vote
I like to hear your plan on this Pandemic not some babble about Joe Biden.
YES!!! Russia is responsible for all the Trump signs and flags I see everywhere!!  And they must be the ones taking down all of the Biden signs!! because I haven’t seen ANY!!
I AGREE VP BIDEN! WE WILL VOTE COME HELL OR HIGH WATER,SLEET,SNOW,STORMS,ECT.. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE DIED FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS TO VOTEEEEEEE !!! THE ONLY WAY WE DON'T VOTE IS DON'T GO TO THE POLLS! TRUMP IS TRYING TO STEAL THE ELECTION AGAIN, SUPRESSING VOTES,CLOSING POST OFFICES!
Ah, so it’s the Russians putting out all of those Trump signs in yards and all of the Trump flags I see everywhere AND it must be the Russians organizing all of the Trump flotillas everywhere AND that would explain why I have seen 0 Biden anything anywhere!! THE RUSSIANS!!!!
did you hear him trashing Trump and bragging on Biden??😡
This has already gone viral. We just need to keep retweeting and retweeting it. Damn what a ad.
🗣️HILLARY CLINTON, LORETTA LYNCH, UNDER OBAMA, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 4 AMERICAN DEATHS IN BENGHAZI!! WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN HIDING?😱 IS HE IN THE BASEMENT WITH JOE??🤔
I’ll note down that you’re in favor of rule by executive decree in case it comes up during the Biden Administration. Or is that only when Trump does it?
IF WE LET TRUMP SAY AND DO THE THINGS THAT HE DOES AND SAY ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE AND GET AWAY WITH IT!!!! THEN WHY IN THE HELLLLLLLLLLLLWHEN VP BIDEN SAY ONE THING THAT SOUND OFF THE TRACK SOME TROUBLE MAKERS WANTS TO LYNCH HIM!!! YES WE HAVE LET TRUMP DESTROY AMERICA AND IT'S VALUE
Joe Biden said some woozy ass racist shit
Fair. It is quite entertaining. In a sad way. Like Biden.
Desperate: Biden grasps for Gretchen Whitmer as potential running mate
Lester the molester...oh I’m sorry...that’s Biden!!! I am shocked and amazed!!! NOT!!!
Remember that when Biden does it.

Well depends who wins. We know if Biden wins it won’t be covered and it’ll be like it went away. If Trump wins it’ll still be here end be the deadly pandemic the world has ever seen. I have no excuses, what would I be making an excuse about?
Biden’s criteria for his VP pic was what?  a. Black, b. Female, c. Nothing else. Not even the most qualified “person” in the country, only Black and Female that’s called making the VP position a quota filled position without consideration for other qualifications.
Obama /Biden will never understand where to find America’s “ Magic Wand”. That Magic Wand being the unleashing of America’s Blue Collar Workers. The backbone of the world in manufacturing a Quality product.

I wonder if Harris went to bed with Biden to get ahead like she did with  Willie Brown?
For 1 thing  didn’t get rich off the  lije  n his fatcat wife Elaine Chao Biden released 20 years of tax returns n financial records something trump is fighting in court to stop after the Supreme Court gave SDNY the go ahead to get his taxes he filed

Something for voters to think about. Biden picked Kamala Harris not because she is the most qualified person In the country.  But because she is Black and female. Looks like Biden is pandering to females and the black community to fill Biden’s Nationaly declared VP quota position

Please tell us what the Biden police reform policy is, specifically its application when a suspect attempts to take a firearm away from a police officer.
Very true. Biden is just gonna tell us: “you gotta get your head out of your ass jack”. Then do nothing other than reverse the shit that trump reversed. It’s like a game of fucking uno. Not to mention he’s gonna gaslight us about climate change too.

Kamala Harris was selected by Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden to serve as his running mate. &gt;&gt;
So I think her plan is going to be run for House seat, get chosen Speaker of House, then if something happens to Biden and Harris - back door to presidency
Trump also urges Americans to wear masks but opposes a national requirement. Plus: The NFL tries to virus-proof stadiums, and local school officials struggle with reopening difficulties.

Kamala Harris does not care about racism or the women that accused Joe Biden of assault or she is lying, just a few short months ago she accused him of both. You can not have it both ways.

I don't think it likely that the outside of the envelope will have any indicators as to how the person voted.  There's also an argument that vote-by-mail will be sabotaged by encouraging Republicans to NOT vote, resulting in a massive landslide for Biden.  (cont)
No comparison. Dems know it too. The only reason they are USING Biden is to associate him with Obama’s name. And now it turns out he was in charge of the biggest scandal in American history. Shows Dems had no one else to run and no one to win. Sad!!!

I don't know that's accurate. Russia and China are backing them and the Iranian leadership aren't rational actors. I do know if Iran gets close to making nuclear weapons trump will use military force to stop them without hesitation. Biden will do nothing.
Black male leaders say Biden will lose election if he doesn't choose Black woman as VP  So are those Black Men saying they Are RACIST? What if a 100 White men told Trump he's to pick a White women or he will Lose? Would Those Whites be Racist DO YOU SEE?🧐?

Joe Biden might have been a proven politician in the past but he isn't anymore. He's old &amp; he is aging quickly. The media is trying to hide you from it but I've listened to him speak. It's rather sad that these folks are putting him through this. He won't finish. He drank to much
LOL yah right. You might you have picked somebody besides a senile fool if you want that to happen. Biden'ts best years are so far gone.
Yah because that bubbling idiot of a fool Biden is actually going to win. The guy who can't even complete a paragraph without it being on a teleprompter. He will get destroyed in the debates. He no longer has it upstairs. You just want to bank on Harris taking over.

Cute! My response was not specific to the tweet, but why you so rarely address the policies Biden seems to support that contradict the teachings you follow and preach like this:
So funny! Two minutes after you asked this, he commented to Biden, but I couldn’t find another on his timeline. I’ve wondered the same thing for awhile. 🤷‍♀️
Biden/Harris raised 11 million dollars in just over an hour after the announcement.  That is how politicians grade things here.

So this silly screed about Biden isn’t any surprise. It’s full of holes but there’s stuff there that the Limbaughfied GOP will love. Hillyer wouldn’t get away with much of what he’s written if those Trumper types hadn’t been built over the decades.
I knew a ‘Never Trumper’ from Alabama would be back at what he did for decades. Hillyer’s hustle attacking Democrats using strawmen, overwrought language ... is useful. It’s a preview of what a Biden presidency will receive from ‘conservative’ outlets.
Biden leads Trump by nearly 50 points among college students: poll

Biden is a huge racist, it’s been seen in multiple interviews.  All the blm donations go to joe, and not a signal dollar has gone back to the black community
I’m voting Trump. It’s just everyone with this hate loves Biden.  I’m asking for 3 reasons why
Joe Biden might say he is a devout catholic but his words and actions say otherwise!
You are correct about his aneurysm but he speaks and has written about stuttering since early childhood.  I am working hard not to be pissed off at people about this. I'm officially declaring today my last day of patience with this.
That is a sticking point with me, but I find Trump to be as close to an anti-Christ figure in 2020 as I can think of for a multitude of reasons that I'm going to give Joe Biden the win. Trump is pro-life only as far as courting anti-abortion voters. ProLife is much more than that
Yeah, because Obama stumping for Biden at a fucking funeral shows class right?President Biden
I'm voting for BIDEN/HARRIS !!!
We can believe ever breathe that Captain Mark Kelly takes!  Vote for HIM !  Whoever you are and wherever you are!.  Also, vote for Biden/Harris if you want a safe and sane United States !
Utter lawlessness in DEMOCRAT controlled city.  Vote Biden/Harris &amp; this shit (anarchy) becomes the new normal. No doubt in my mind when Trump wins in Nov, he will do whatever's required to finally restore law &amp; order by whatever means necessary. We've waited long enough.
BIDEN/HARRIS !  IS MY CHOICE, I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO VOTE !!
The gaffe machine Joe Beijing Biden thinks he’s already President hey dumb 🐴The re-election is not till November and the tears will fall again on lame stream media and the View and in all Socialist Marxist Circles
Kamala Harris had more black Americans placed behind bars in her time as a prosecutor than any prosecutor of modern times Just the Facts 🐴🐴🐴🐴Swamp Creatures her Biden Pelosi Schumer Schiff Nadlar Vote them out before they ruin America 🐴
If Biden were Republican running for office, every media outlet would be demanding physicals &amp; his list of prescription drugs like Aricept. Because his declining mental health is clearly obvious, they wouldn't let up. BUT, since Biden's a Democrat, one of them, not 1 word spoken.

He certainly should be along with McCabe, Comey, Rosenstien, Strock, Page, Rice, Biden, Obama, Priestp, Orr, his wife Nellie .   Christopher Wray should be fired and considered for indictment after refusing to expose the dossier as phony in 2018.
That’s the Real Joe Biden a Real RACIST FOR THE LAST 48 Years!!
That’s the REAL Joe Biden he’s a REAL RACIST!!  Has been for 47 years!
But Joe Biden though......
Oh, yes ! If we get an honest chance to get the correct ballot count maybe Biden/Harris will help us get back to being a real Democracy.
So when Joe Biden mangled “Kamala” in his speech today, while reading from the teleprompter, guess that was “disrespect” too😏 #LiberalHogwash #KAG2020
Everyone of you liberals have to cuss on some point of your tweet. Does that help get your point across? Oh and your an ass hat.  Prove that Obama and Biden did anything positive for our military or for our country for that matter.
I've a deep blue acquaintance who said years ago emphatically  emphasizing his political persuasion, "I'd vote for Mickey Mouse if he were a Democrat!" He told me after Biden's VP pick, that he's voting Trump. But he said Gretchen, Newsom &amp; weeks of Portland, sealed his decision.
how can Kamala Harris simultaneously call Joe Biden a racist, and a rapist, the two worst names you can be as a white man, then run as his VP 😂 the democrats are such a joke 🤦🏽‍♂️
And that’s your view. My whole point is about not voter shaming people. I disagree with you, but I’m not like if you vote for Biden then you’re voting for all the wars hes perpetuated, the racist systems he’s fought to uphold, and etc.
Dems say that EVERY YEAR. “If this were a regular election”. I’m not debating you on if Trump is a fascist. He is, but it is counterproductive to tell people “if you don’t vote for Biden, you’re voting for Trump and everything he does”. And lmk when Alabama turns blue lmao.
&amp; likely future president...what are the odds Biden makes it to '24?
Those peoples’ votes aren’t going to matter anyways. What’s the point in voter shaming someone who lives in a safe republican state that Trump won by 20+ points? There’s absolutely no point. It’s a waste of breath. If it’s a swing state, sure vote for Biden. But that’s not
Something that really gets me is the extreme views from both sides regarding what could happen if one candidate gets elected over the other. The country is not going to end if Trump gets reelected and neither will it end if Biden becomes president. It will just look different.
Not voting bc you dont like the option of biden or kamala is equivalent to voting for trump!   Those are our options, go vote.
I dont think so. I think there are enough republicans who are dis associating themselves from Trump and voting Biden as a one time deal. They wont ever be Democrats. They will be what keeps the party in check or the split will cause a new party. We are due for that historically.
Exactly! Sure I don't believe everything that Biden says or will do but I believe he has the character we need in this country right now.
Now we can stop asking who will Biden pick and get on with the race. Less than 100 days to go.

Reaching hard for the black vote. This is the same Kamala Harris that called Biden a racist at the Democratic debate
Wow doesn't he know that's what the primary season is all about, a healthy vigorous debate on the issues. It actually says a lot that Biden moved past that and picked her.
There are possibly innocent people in prison because of Kamala Harris. Under no circumstance will I vote for Biden in November.

Biden hasn't the stamina for four minutes!
We have no idea about how far and wide Trump his criminal cohorts have done to us personally and people we do not know! Fight to get our Country back to using the laws we and forefathers worked to form The United States of America!           Vote for Biden !  An honest man.
He had a chance in the primary, but the convention pushed for Biden. The primaries is where we have to make noise. Or it just comes down to the lesser of the two.
CBS ABC MSNBC continually but never actually show you who is doing all this polling professors from Liberal colleges are shooting out these polls just Like the Hillary polls when you only poll 75% Democrats Biden will always win 🐴🐴🐴🐴
Biden is not capable of making any decisions by himself - why not ask for a cognitive test for him before the Nov. election so people will know he’s sick and that he can’t lead our great country and is just a figurehead Illuminati puppet run by his deep state operative handlers!
We already pay too much we can’t afford to elect Joe Biden. 30% capital gains tax already feels like I’m working with the mob.

"Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids." -Joe Biden
Biden has been a politician for 50 yrs, look at his record. The guy comes out of the house once every 2 weeks and has to apologize every time he opens his mouth. The dems can't pick a legitimate candidate so they have to start race riots and blow things entirely out of proportion

Be careful, they are crazy. I’m from Alabama as well and I would not dare put anything Biden anywhere, they really are crazy.
You would think they would grow weary of hearing the same things each time. They can't find any good dirt on Biden or Harris that everyone doesn't already know. So they are "career politicians."

Need any more evidence of Biden’s deminished mental ability. Has anyone ever shopped for a book by not examining the cover and inside first?  And then he grabs a handful. === Blown Photo op.
Even the less educated black person knows that the black vote MUST go to Biden/Harris. In the South where "Southern Political Segregation" dominates....white Republican Legislators often pass laws to suppress the goals of majority black cities.  Democrats support black cities.
Every derogatory statement kamala made about biden will now be chalked up to “it was a debate” and the media will let her get away with it.  Disappointing, but not surprising in the least.
If Biden should elected he will be shown to be unfit to serve within the month. Ms. Harris will be president. That’s the plan.
She got famous for singing about her bad choices in men.. now she chooses Biden.

Hey!  Have you noticed how many people who think they’re neuropsychologists diagnosing dementia in Biden?
There is nothing more trump could of done than he did. And he was criticized by the hypocrite left for what he did do. The amount of people dead if Pelosi or Biden had been in charge would be doubled. You want to dislike trump and vote for radical socialists fine.
So you’re a neuropsychologist now? There’s no evidence that Biden has dementia.

Saying Biden picked a woman of color suggests that he overlooked other candidates for a woman of color because he wanted to please the African-American community who supported him. Yes he should seriously serve the needs of all, he picked the BEST OF ALL, senator Kamala Harris.

The video was edited significantly in a deceptive manner.  Most especially where he is talking about biden, yet the video puts trump on the screen to make it appear as tho he is talking about trump.  It is a grey area, but it is a political ad from DNC.

It would be nice to see Hillary Clinton serve in Joe Biden's administration if he is elected on November 3. Democrats, again, it's up to us. If we show up in large numbers, we win. It is extremely important that we  show up in large numbers. ALL Democrats need to  vote on Nov. 3.
regretfully, the two party system and electoral college denies the freedom to vote for a more varying array of candidates. we vote the biden in, unless we want the trump again.
Would someone tell me why this is true? Joe Biden was a Senator most of his life and knows what the government is supposed to do and how it can work effectively - not where a party closes it in a crisis and goes on vacation.

Exactly.😆 I made the post in response to this Politico article:  ‘The President Was Not Encouraging’: What Obama Really Thought About Biden
Did Biden tell you that? He tends to exaggerate(lie) about where he graduated. Trump graduated from Wharton which has the  #1 ranked MBA in the US. So I'll pass on the TDS infected liberal's opinion on his intelligence.
Simply put, the Obama admin coddled the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, and the Trump admin blew them to pieces and ushered in a peace agreement between neighboring states in the region.   Hard to chalk it up to anything else, but Biden and the media will find a way.
Of course Hillary was a shark of a politician—fully willing to take down anyone to be president—but I hope she watches as Biden actually crosses the finish line, too. Like, why would she or Obama look down their noses at a man who’s almost universally liked? It’s straight elitism
If even a sliver of this is true, it actually makes me resent Obama. His elitism needs to stay far away from his public image, b/c frankly it makes him look like a technocratic asshole. I honestly hope Biden sails to victory by historic margins—&amp; I hope Obama watches it happen.
Just like biden and Epstein
Maybe you've enjoyed what little freedom you've had. But the people in US prisons from Biden's crime bill haven't. Nor have the people who died from the wars. Or the lack of healthcare. But apparently, for some, you need only show them the wolf to get them to run to the fox

I didn't say Biden was a saint or even that he was a good candidate. I didn't even mention his name. What I'm saying is that Trump trying to claim that his opponent is racist is a stupid argument bc he is clearly racist himself. Not a zero sum. They can BOTH suck, which they do.
Saw your spot on MSNBC. We need every Dem senator and representative in Washington speaking out...Biden/Harris need your support as well as the Resistance....We must all unite to take our country back from the fascist wannabe dictator.
The difference is that I don’t agree w that what he thinks it should be. Like I said, simply put,  I think Biden is the better person but he is usually misguided in what is best for the country.  I think Trump is genuinely a bad person but he is more inline w policies.
Oh, absolutely not. I’m a “both sides are terrible” kind of person. Nothing annoys me more than people who only see wrongs of one party. Biden had an agenda.  However, in Biden’s case I think his agenda is more an attempt to make the country what he thinks it should be.&gt;

You know it will. Do you know for sure that Biden will not be able to conduct himself as president. He will be removed and then will have Harris as president. If that happens, we’re all doomed.
Biden calls for nationwide mask mandate
He likely would’ve won those too lol. Biden won due to moderates joining together while Bernie lost to a split progressive field.

Joe Biden is not Donald Trump. He can read. He understands what he reads. He’s intelligent and an astute politician. Trump is a grifter, a fake and can’t pronounce the words on the paper he’s given.
I am a center left reliable Democratic voter. I voted for Joe Biden in the Democratic primaries because he was my favorite of the candidates. I am a boring person who believes in institutions and continuity and disdains conspiracy theories.

gonna be honest it is so discouraging and upsetting seeing people I love and care about really stoked on the November election. trying to justify it in anyway that Biden is what we need or is an easy replacement for Trump's administration. "Get Cheeto out of office" is gospel.

The media’s survival depends on this election.  It’s only the beginning. There will be some ridiculous things happen with the Biden campaign over the next few months that they will willfully ignore. They have to protect him. He’s the last shot they get for the next 4 years.
Progressive/liberal voices will never win out if they don't vote. The tweet wasn't really about Biden being drawn left, its about the party's politics being drawn left.
This was a political stunt...What are the statistical probabilities of this taking place on the day after Biden made his VP choice?  And it is NOT peace in the middle east...and Jared is a obnoxious ass.
With Biden -Harris, we will return to accountability, integrity and law &amp; order. Thank God.  #VoteBidenHarris2020
So, I'll support the candidate who I think can best defeat Trump regardless. If you think Biden/Harris is going to be worse for trans folk than Trump/Pence, you are delusional. I can't afford to only ally with the moral. There's too few of them, and I want us to survive.

Does that include Joe Biden for raping Tara Read?
What about Tara Read?  When is that going to be addressed. She reported Biden for rape!  What a double standard...shame on you!
has to drive you insane that while you criticize Tucker Carlson for mispronouncing Kamala’s name, her running mate Joe Biden pronounces it the same way. Hilarious 😂
How about Joe Biden’s mangling of her name?  Waiting on your column about that disrespect or are you a hypocrite?
Biden’s smart in that way. Had he chosen someone with that skin color and true african facial features like Val Demmings, Karen Bass or Stacy Abrams he never would’ve gotten a single white vote.
Total obscurity. Being tied to Biden even more, her policy ambitions crushed. All because she wanted  ⅕ of the vote in her home state
I wish Warren was the VP, it'd be the perfect punishment for her sticking us with Biden
Which involved both parties (not just Biden alone) and the fall out of such bill being enacted within the limits of the law leads to the overwhelming persecution of Black and Brown bodies. Attorneys can’t rewrite the law mid case (not completely Kamala’s fault)...
Just curious what about purpose of Biden’s campaign. For the first time in history this mentally impaired dude is running because “this is my turn now” with no actual platform other than get rid of Trump.
It’s not true that Biden did nothing as Obama’s VP. “Sleepy Joe” made a number of members of his immediate and extended family rich. Hunter got $1.5 Billion out of the Chinese Communist Party in just one trip to China with Daddy, for example.
Biden does nothing from a basement &amp; his approval goes up? Bs!

great show tonight.  thanks for showing  Biden mispronouncing his running mates name. Hahaha
The left created these monsters, and they're not going away with a Biden presidency. If you believe for one second that these people are going to magically become reasonable when they control the White House again, then I have some beach front property in Nebraska to sell you.
Hey  ,  just made you look more foolish than you already are, and EVERYONE saw it.  When you ripped him for mispronouncing KAMALA , nobody saw it until he played the clip! By the way, how did Joe Biden do with her name today?  You losers are pathetic!
Looks like Biden's choice of Kamala Harris has assured  that he will lose. Well done
Yeah, Biden got it wrong today.
There's not a person in the white house that would try to correct Donald Trump in his blundering about history &amp; different years &amp; what happened during those years but he's got nerve to talk about Joe Biden being slow Trump can't pronounce English words that are used everyday.
I mean I’m clearly going to vote for Biden and Harris. I’m not going to like it. I’m not voting for THEM I’m voting to get that buffoon out of office.
I was wondering if CNN or MSNBC would cut away for trump. He purposively planned his media joke to take time away from Biden/Harris, but it didn't work. I mean, what did he say anyway besides, lie, blame, insult, and take credit for Obama's work.
Obviously Biden pronouncing her name “Camel-uh” is to get back at her for calling him a racist who she believes sexually harassed women.
Would you care to put your $ where your mouth is? We can each put $10k in escrow and whoever's candidate wins gets the $20k minus the escrow fees. I've already got piles bet on Biden +120, but I'll definitely take more action at evens. Let me know.
The beginning emphasis on Biden's filial love in Harris speech was a brilliant move. We as a nation are hungry for precisely that during COVID crisis. But it also serves as a stark contrast to Trump &amp; his family. What else do we expect from the son of a whoremongerer?
The only way I would not vote for Biden Is if he took Drumpf as his VP. I am glad he picked someone far more qualified. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide
Remember the Pandemic Response Team that Trump disbanded. That was Obama and Biden. If only Trump and GOP listened to the WHO, CDC, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx. Trump is the President not Biden (not yet anyway). Trump was given the tools to combat Covid but he refused them all of it.
Pence: “You locked up thousands of black people for non-violent crimes such as weed possession. Also, do you still believe Biden sexually harassed those women and is he still a racist?”  Drops mic and walks of stage.
Also, that’s a lie. She did not say “far worse things” about Biden.
Tara Reade wants media to ask Harris about 'smear campaign' over sex assault claim against Biden
It is sad what the Dems are doing. It is obvious Biden has mental issues yet.......
If you are talking about the Biden-Harris conference, then I wholeheartedly agree! I felt like it was Nov. of'08 when Obama was elected! It was a wonderful feeling!
We all knew, know  is certifiable. The back to back with Biden only bolsters our resolve to be rid of this doddering fool.
Its funny how these polls show Biden ahead by 4 or 5 points. Then you scroll down and the survey shows that they surveyed a 1,000 register voters. Also it was done by CNBC, CBS or CNN. All fake...
Joe biden is a race baiter and unqualified.  As always I hope this helps

I’m so tired. It’s even worse for an AA that holds that position. I’ve been told on many FB posts that criticism of Obama, Biden, Kamala or the Democratic establishment means I must want Trump again or that I voted for him. It’s exhausting trying to explain this to people.
We need the bulldog persecution attitude Kamala has when it’s comes to getting Trump out of office. Honestly prison reform wasn’t changed when Obama was in office for 8 years..of course it takes more than that. So what makes you think not voting Biden will help in this situation.

Well that's kind of a problem since Project Lincoln has already pledged to support Biden's agenda in office.
There are way too many people arguing that Kamala and Biden are worst than Trump and Pence. That frightens me.
Funny, That’s not what you said about Biden in the debates.
I love justice roberts! I'll applaud that choice ; )  I do wonder what you think disqualifies Biden. With regards to strict constructionists like Scalia, my experience is that they only apply that philosophy when it aligns with their right-wing agenda.
I think it's bcuz she doesn't associate with blacks... She said she Indian and Jamaican... Then after literally almost killing Biden's campaign and they beef... She ends up joining him... It's like she playing both sides .. It don't matter who wins as long as she in
Exactly...who would ever thought I'll say Trump might be. The better pic... Bcuz Biden and Harris is an tricky selection... Just feel like they phony
Get EVERYTHING off your chest now, as you should, just be sure you vote Biden-Harris in November!
See what he did there??   (There will NEVER be a Biden/Trump debate, btw)
Obama and Biden embrace equality and kindness for all; Trump hates everyone but himself; especially hates women.This statement is supported by Trump's record of continued abuse and denigration of women.  Trump needs to reconsider that hate, how the hell does he think he got here?
This is an absolutely blessed morning. Having blocked out the annoying Trump people and right wing propagandists, it has been going absolutely fantastic. The Biden/Harris celebration 🍾 continues.
👍 on  Trump says he was surprised Biden picked Kamala Harris as running mate
Roy S Johnson: Hearing that Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris... I thought about so many bold, bad-a Black women in #Alabama who are leading, organizing, and galvanizing our political landscape.
All Joe Biden’s choice did was make this war between black men and black women worse!
Great VP choice Biden couldn’t do any better
I look at the overall picture. Democrats have a strong record in protecting and preserving the two laws that are most important for me and mine throughout history. Biden/Harris 2020
is the leader we need in this nation at this time in history. The opposition will call names, whine and complain. The reality is, we need adults and responsible people to fix this broken nation. Biden/Harris will begin that process. I have never felt so energized!
Exactly! That’s why this clown is in office now. We have to rely on some of those Republicans (who are sick of Trump) to vote for Biden for him to win smh!
Find out what The Breakfast Club thinks about Biden picking Senator Harris as his running mate! -
the DNC wants us all to go back to the Obama administration. back when they ended racism and nobody payed as much attention to politics. that’s what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris represent; it’s Obama’s VP and another black, and that’s all they are.
The only thing Republicans have is “radical left” and tired name calling. They can’t call out Biden or Harris on issues with all the damage Trump has done.
Also, hell of an admission that Biden won't be able to handle "bad crap".
Joe Biden think he slick but most people already know wassup with her
Also, just FTR, I did not vote for the President the last time, and I certainly won’t this time around. But I will not be voting for the Biden/Harris ticket.
MJ or Lebron is stoking racial division? Biden said all black people are the same just last week. Why isn’t CNN reporting that.
The TLDR is this: I think all things being equal (i.e. mental fitness), a Harris presidency would yield more “progressive” outcomes than a Biden one. That’s likely more scary to me than you, but that’s where I’m coming from. (End, I guess)
This again also assumes Biden is “all there.” Our current president is clearly unstable, but there are real concerns about Biden’s mental acuity. I don’t think it’s just a right-wing talking point. Biden may be subject to whomever he surrounds himself with at this point. (10)
I have a hard time seeing Biden pushing through a true Medicare for all or single payer system, but I can see Kamala doing the same. (9)
Finally, there are the reasons I think she’d be worse than Biden. Both have a horrible record on CJ so that’s a wash. But when it comes to matters of other domestic policy, I do feel Harris is more of “this progressive moment.” I’m going off what I saw on the trail and the past.8
She speaks so well of Biden 😂😂😂. She called him a segregationist
Good luck with our country moving toward socialism. I am with your father, and hope he gets well. Also, wishing you well but hope you will research policies of Biden. The platform of the left is not moderate and will be the destruction of our country.
President Barack Obama said presidential candidate Joe Biden nailed the decision to select Kamala Harris as his running mate, and other Democrats have also praised her selection.
Again, I know why I'm voting for Biden/Harris. I'm excited. I must move on to share that excitement with other people I know. Good-bye.
We are All Sick to death of Trump savage attacks on anyone one who does not worship at the altar of the choosen one. Rejoice.  Biden and Kamala  Civility Dignity Honesty

Honestly.. with the choices in this election, I wouldn’t blame anyone for not voting this time. I said what I said.. Trump is worse but.. Biden and Kamala are pure trash..
Dems, this election is too important to waste our time responding to attacks by bots, Trump people, and other Republican supporters.  Block them out!! Spend that time urging other Democratic supporters to rush to the polls on Nov. 3 and vote for Biden/Harris and other Democrats.
hey for those of you critiquing biden for picking a VP “just because” she’s a woman of color, you should REALLY be more concerned that throughout history our leaders have been overwhelmingly white males “just because”
She's being used by Biden to pander to minorities and women. Smart people would see right through this and realized the Dems that have been promising he same crap for 50 yrs hasn't delivered.
I am in no way a politician or really even into politics, but DT gone win again because y’all don’t wanna vote for Joe Biden 😩
How Biden chose Harris: Inside his search for a running mate
Why not Joe Biden?
This is the main reason I would not be able to vote to Biden/Harris (there are a lot others, but this is the main)
She did not accuse Biden of being a segregationist. She challenged one aspect of his boast about being able to work with people he disagreed with.
Op-Ed: Kama Harris and the Growing Political Power on Black Women: In #Alabama, Black women and the Black Voters Matter Fund played pivotal roles in the election of Doug Jones to the Senate in 2017.
Are the suburbans happy you kept minorities out of the neighborhood?  Probably if we're being honest...   Will it be enough to keep them from voting for Biden for social clout and to keep up with the Joneses? Probably not
You sure he didn't? How many people you think died because of the 1994 Crime Bill? Perhaps, you're just unwilling to face the truth that both Biden &amp; Trump are soulless sociopaths.
Can we put self-serving cancel culture on the back burner for ONCE? If we do not get Donald Trump out of office now, we may not have another election.   This isn’t about the needs/wants of few, this is about the needs/wants of many. Joe Biden is the most qualified candidate.
This suburban mom is 100% with Biden/Harris.
Biden is being controlled by the Squad and other far left Democrats.
And we are surprised that right wing media is attacking Joe Biden’s VP pick?
I repeat. Just block the idiotic bots, racists, conservatives, and Trump people. It's easy and convenient. Then continue this momentus celebration 🍾  of....Biden/Harris 2020. It's a wonderful feeling. I love it!! 💘
For some reason, the DNC researchers determined that three factors motivated their voter base:  1) Mental deficiency  2) Pedophillia  3) Kwowing what Willie Brown tastes like  Joe Biden’s got the first two covered and Kamala can write Yelp reviews on number 3.
Wow!! I feel absolutely wonderful this morning. I thank God for this unspeakable joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
These idiotic bots and Trump people are trying to crush our celebration 🍾 of our impressive Biden/Harris Democratic ticket. Just block their misery and annoyance. Keep celebrating and spreading the joy. Biden/Harris 2020.
Yet, Biden voters are not labeled as “coon” lol I honestly want to know what the non-voters are doing for the country.
I am 100% supporting  the BIDEN-HARRIS  ticket! 100%!!!
I woke up this morning and saw these bots and Trump people tweets all over my phone/computer. It's ridiculous!! I immediately started blocking the morons. Dems, don't argue with them. They're not worth it. We don't need anything to impede our joy and celebration of Biden/Harris.
Precisely this.  is delusional. Nearly EVERY minority is excited for Biden Harris ticket. But more importantly, minorities are desperate to get rid of  Watch the blue wave.
Trump’s pandemic is his biggest failure as president. And he doesn’t care. Biden and Harris should start speaking out every day about the pandemic specifically. Make Trump own his failure completely.
Honey you legit cannot call anyone racist...pack your bags Donny boy! If Covid doesn’t get ya Biden/Harris WILL. Thank u, next.
I’m not voting for Joe Biden ever
Damnit Joe Biden damnit
Having said that I'm going to mute "Harris" and "Biden" before I set my mail in ballot on fire :)
Pam what's your angle? Why are you attacking Biden?
Medhi I hear what you're saying but until November 3rd it will be helpful is rose Twitter stops bashing Biden and helps us get rid of Trump and win the Senate. Biden isn't going to veto his own party and we can pull harder to the left with him than we can with Trump.
We need to celebrate 🍾 Kamala Harris becoming Joe Biden's running mate &amp; next Vice President
That’s a convenient perspective to ignore Biden’s cop VP recently saying he’s a racist whose guilty of sexually harassing women.   I suppose people truly will talk themselves into believing anything that allows them to continue supporting their “team.”
I heard “Angela Davis is voting for Biden. What do you know that she doesn’t?” 🙌🏻
Joe Biden is the Presidential candidate
I was all Biden/Harris 2020!!! But then they said she was a phony, and a meanie, so now I just don't know who I should vote for.  I don't like meanies.
Burning down all the corporations isn't on the ticket this year. And if we try and force it on there then we will lose and they will get stronger and harder to beat next time. Obama/Biden admin signed Dodd Frank. Trump repealed it.
Maybe the people who are still whining about Kamala Harris's statements about Joe Biden in debates are still stuck thinking a woman criticizing them is unforgivable.
How Biden selected Kamala Harris as his running mate
The right is getting what its way because they won. If Trump had said he was going to do all he's done, he wouldn't have won. Politics is hard. Biden wants to expand healthcare. Trump doesn't. That's not hard. M4A is one way. Its not the only way. You pick 1 guy. Not an ideal.
I didn't know you were a political philosopher. There is a reality where the next president will either be Trump or Biden &amp; if people don't work to elect Biden then there will be less progress. RBG isn't going to live forever. You want 6-3 far right scotus decisions for life?
Now y’all who follow my post know how much I love to troll the Republican Party but this time to be fair the Democratic Party ￼gotta get these jokes. Didn’t Kamala Harris ￼last year say she believed Joe Biden sexually assaulted all those women and there stories should be told.
I don't get the rhetoric that Kamala Harris was the only choice for AG. She turned down being Obama's AG. The notion that she is the only one who can be Biden's AG is ridiculous.
and this is an example of why Joe Biden is winning next month.
1) Body Language Expert Alleges Numerous Indications in the Presidential Debate That Joe Biden May Have Been Wearing a Wire | David Harris Jr.    I tweeted about his slack look and staring out over the crowd several times later in debate. I said Earpiece!
Important issue. Too bad Biden won't do anything about it.
Next week he’ll be holding rallies saying ‘see I told you it was nothing, I’ve got good genes.’  Left always takes the high road.  Biden campaign pulled it’s negative ads.   I really don’t care as long as we end this mess next month.
Our store is LIVE! We've got Biden-Harris gear, expand Medicaid merch, and of course, Alabama Democrats logo apparel so you can rep the scrappiest party in the South. Get it all here:

Lying Biden strikes again!
The single greatest act Jeff Sessions ever did, memorialized on film, was to knock Joe Biden's hand away from his granddaughter.
The problem with this take is that Cal is polling well ahead of Biden in NC. He leads Tillis by an average of six while the presidential race is tied. So I don't know that Tillis's problem has been being too close to Trump. It's that people just like Cal better.
The timing is entirely too strange. All that Trump has done and hasn’t caught anything, yet he goes to one debate and gets Covid? And Biden is suddenly “friendly”? Way too many red flags being raised.
More like 70-30 for Biden.  Americans are done with Trump, his corruption, and his crimes.  #LockHimUp
Please keep believing your own nonsense.  Biden will win in an electoral landslide because our country is sick of Trump, his lies and crimes, and his failure to protect us.  And once Trump is out of office, let the prosecutions begin.  #LockHimUp

Jones just played a brief video endorsement by Joe Biden (Jones worked on Biden's 1988 presidential campaign). Biden urged Jones' re-election and added "The stakes in this election have never been higher for our country." #ALSEN #alpolitics
Joe Biden cannot qualify for Commander-n-Chief because he is being coached by Obama and merely a Democratic Party Leader according to him since he n9ow possesses more money than that political party has. Just a heads up Sen Cruz.
Thank you Mr/Mrs Biden.  In the end we are all AMERICANS
Just for the sake of argument, let us suppose that Trump gracefully bows out on account of his health and convinced he can't win the suburbs resigns and Pence becomes president. Pence defeats Biden in the 2020 election in an unlikely turn of events 🤔
let’s hear about Biden’s 2 frontal lobe aneurys as well. Everyone should know how servers they were &amp; brain loss from them
Give me a break. Would you be saying that if Biden came down with it? And I'm not for either side so don't think I'm a Trump supporter. I'm just saying that if the role were reversed every Biden supporter would say it was Trump's fault because he didn't work a miracle.
All Biden has to do is give a speech in a mask and say he trusts the experts and it's important to have good leadership and that's basically a negative Trump ad anyway.
I think if joe bidens campaign pushed the “Big Perc Biden” narrative he runs away w this election
Joe Biden tests negative for the Presidency!
God forgive you  voting for brain damaged Biden  2 frontal lobe aneurysms  read about that damage  My sister had 1 with medications that Biden didn’t have  never same
Herd of sheep with CNN &amp; brain damaged Biden &amp; BLM lover Kamala.  prayer for our President &amp;FLOTUS
Remind her of what Joe Biden said if Mitt Romney won.   It never happened. "Biden tells African-American audience GOP ticket would put them "back in chains" - CBS News"
Biden said “in conclusion thus what happens when you don’t wear your mask” 😂
WITHOUT TRUMP⁉️⁉️ That’s Wouldn’t Be Fair, but that’s the way you Cowardice repub’s operate. It would give Biden the chance to talk to the People without being interrupted, you still want it to go forward? Let’s Do it, without trump!
So by simply holding ... excuse me ATTEMPTING to hold the President to the standards that his team had agreed to he was trying to help Biden? i would say he was trying to help the American people.
Just another Lie and Con!  Thought Biden was going to pull out the remaining debates, and he didn’t. He does not want to put the time in to prepare. His poll numbers are plunging, he was getting hammered on the debate and his love of white hate groups.
Whether it’s Trump or Biden were fucked either way
I’m curious why he didn’t ask Biden what he meant when he said “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black”.
Oh, Pmease  spare us a whole day of CHRIS Wallace saying I’m told Biden group came into debate wearing masks but First Family didn’t. Has to be inserted into this as he whined this morning he hoped he was far enough away from Trump not to be exposed.
Biden was on the same stage as President Trump. If Biden catches it will you be as happy to see him die? 47 years in office he has be caught lying, plagiarism, racist actions, and the list goes on. Does all people that you don’t like deserve to die?
Trump doesn't really have Coronavirus. He's just using this as an excuse to lay low now that even Fox news is calling him out for courting white supremist and violence. He also now has an excuse to not have to debate Joe Biden after performing so badly. He'll emerge just fine!
He is a clown. He is repulsive. He is a racist. He is your idol. He called a pandemic a hoax and said it is what it is when 200 died. All this tweet shows is Biden is a decent man while you, well, typical MAGA.
12:54 a.m  tweets about his Covid test.  7:30 a.m Peter Doocy reports Biden probably doesn’t know yet bc he doesn’t usually get up til 8. Who do you want to be potus?
Peter Doocy tells   that Biden may not know about Trump’s’ Covid rest bc ‘Biden TRIES to get up by 8 a.m.’. Wow! I’ve been seeing news since 6:30 so know more than potential president? Can you imagine Biden schedule? Up-8. Breakfast 9; 2 calls-nap. Lid
No. They Tested Positive. Big difference. Praying no symptoms. Isn’t it convenient for Biden?
Didn’t we say it wouldn’t be long before either Biden or Trump would test positive for Covid to 1) STOP DEBATES 2)Get a MASK MANDATE 3) STOP TRUMP RALLIES.    We pray it’s fake but if not that   and Hope Hicks do not get sick. The media about to go nuts!
He is most likely still lying.... benefits include;  1) Doesn't have to debate Biden 2) He can say he has it, recover and say its all a hoax
just using ur logic you think trump is those things so all of his supports are those. i think biden is so therefore you are ;)
Trunp &amp; Biden got Covid or nah? what's happening?
Lol  how Trump was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask so often and now look #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid
Hoping Biden wasn't infected at the debate. A rare unmasked event for Joe.
But Biden didn't.
He could've been exposed at the debate. Trump's yelling for 90 minutes would've sent aerosol virus into the whole room, if he does test positive. Biden was unmasked.... Lord, lord keep Biden safe.
No sir, Joe Biden does not turn me on.......I’m a dude,  OT a little girl so ole sleepy Joe won’t like me anyway.
But why? I thought it’s just a flu or a hoax (I don’t remember what’s the latest version). Looks like Trump is so scared of Biden he’s faking a quarantine to avoid the next debate. 😂
Hahahahaha!  You made me spit sweet tea on my cat!😂😂😂😂😂
The socialist leftist extremists who pull Biden’s puppet strings, who want to overthrow our constitution scare me a whole lot more than a narcissist who has fought tooth and nail for our country.
Biden calling Trump names I guess is what you would consider mature and acting like an adult.  Your problem is you don’t like Trump’s personality, but you can’t come up with a good policy reason to vote against him.
Now do Joe Biden.
Biden is far from a leader. He’s been rejected as a presidential candidate twice already. Was rejected for Hillary in 2016. 47 years, only thing he “lead” was crime bill putting numerous blacks behind bars. You remember Justice Thomas hearings? Biden no leader then either.
Don’t be a fool Josh. She admitted that she misspoke.  She confused Rhodes College with Rhodes Scholar. Now, there’s no confusing UDel with HBCU Del State, so go after Biden. AND, Biden didn’t teach Constitutional law for 20 years.
Biden Tells Trump To Shut Up 'Will You Shut Up Man'
Yeah, I agree with that sentiment for sure. I'm not for complete deregulation.  I don't want to vote for Donald Trump because he's an absolute asset. And Biden a little better.And Jo talks about total liberation. But its like.. damn. Can we have. A medium here??
Gave the eulogy of Sen Byrd who founded WVA KKK, called him his mentor.  read excerpts from letters Biden wrote to infamous racist White Supremacists inside/outside Senate
Trump just condemned the Proud Boys, the KKK and white supremacy on Hannity and attacked Joe Biden for his superpredators comment and for supporting the 1994 crime bill
What an outstanding iteration of  ‘s racist history.1984 ‘Super Predator’ Crime Bill  Bill Clinton signed that HIllary followed up with her famous 1996 Super Predator remarks about blacks. Biden called Sen Byrd his mentor. Byrd started/headed WVA KKK
Joe Biden is the white power candidate. Donald Trump let the superpredators out of prison. Joe Biden pals around with segregationists and supported the 1994 crime bill and Defense of Marriage Act
I am sorry you don’t care about the opinions of your viewers. Many are tired of this continued story, after POTUS has repeatedly denounced white supremacy and affiliated organizations. Just google it and you can see montages of them. And please ask Biden the same
Chris Wallace: Trump 'bears the primary responsibility for what happened' at the debate  #FoxNews Can Democrat Chris Wallace please leave Fox and go to CNN or MSNBC where he belongs?
Sorry, maybe you do not realize that Biden's coach is Obama. Biden believes he is The Democratic Party but yet has he considered what position a President has most high, The Commander-n-Chief which Joe cannot function as.
You were being subjected to Biden's comedy takes to avoid answering any question so you should have ignored him.
Biden brought him up to play the sympathy card while being questioned about Hunter. If he can’t answer he defers or laughs.
You choice of men should have been Joe Biden who Trump angered that diversity Trump has banned that Biden was initializing against African Americans, who supplies that majority of Arabic Gum for the world.
Joe Biden’s Vacant Debate (And Eyes).  Love Jed like black contacts to me as though light sensitive. Same when he got off train next day.
Did Biden really just say that Trump and his friends look down on Irish Catholics like him. Butttttt Amy Coney Barrett is TOO Catholic to be in the Supreme Court!!! 😩😩😩😩 I cant take it!!! (Pat screeching voice) #agonizing
I didn’t get a chance to vote but just want to say we can’t let the GOP stay in power.  Everywhere that Biden is insufficient Trump is way worse.
Poor  CHRIS Wallace has a memory as bad as James Comey’s and Joe Biden’s
I have been working out 7 days a week for 5 years. My pecks have improved, but they are nothing like that. I only do one hour a day. But honestly, I don't want to look like Rock. And I am not big on Joe Biden-- I don't care how many pushups he can do.
Everyone runs interference for Biden , who will really be running the Country? Did they take Biden adds down ?
Screenshot of my post yesterday Annie. I agree that the debate was awful. Offal may be a better descriptor. However, that said, Biden is a policy disaster in every way.
So why are you anti-Trump? And you think Biden would do better?
If it came to passing a surprise drug test, I wouldn’t hesitate in picking Hunter Biden over Donald Trump Jr. Donny stays lit like a 1980s Colombian. #boogersugar
I you didn’t.  You’re a complete fool to believe you did.  Biden looked calm and collected.  You acted like a petulant toddler. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020
I’m honestly confused how is a person suppose to vote between Biden OR Trump ?? Is this a joke.. They’re both nasty AND racists ??? So what am I supposed to do ?? I guess packing a bag and moving to a far away mystical fairy land is the only option for me

So the Commission on Presidential Debates is also compromised... whatever you have to do protect Biden and prevent Trump from destroying his ass! All assets have been activated, win the election by all means necessary! #CancelTheDebates
This is Joe Biden's vison for America.
Do you think Chris Wallace was unbiased? He seemed to coddle Biden and evening protect him when he started to fumble his words. He asked Trump hard questions that could’ve easily been asked if Biden, but weren’t.
Why won’t you condemn Antifa and BLM, both extreme left wing radical terrorist groups? Why didn’t you ask Biden to condemn them?
Joe can't keep up, it is not about us, it has to be about what we think we need to do about a Commander-n-Chief but Joe that is not you to be engaged in if you think it is about us cause we need a Commander-n-Chief not just a man named Joe Biden.
Biden Stands With the Lawless Mob | Opinion
So much for the invisible moderator!  Wallace definitely carried Biden’s water last night. Disgusting and outrageous.
Sure when he said Joe Biden shouldn’t be President
Biden should have never entered politics.
Naturally suppressing Free Speech. “Oh, you must do as we tell you even if you are President of United States.” I’d tell them fine in exchange for drug tests/ear piece/wire checks and No Notes. Biden was reading last night too.
Something to ponder. Perhaps Trump runs his campaign, not the other way around. Biden campaign does run Biden, not the other way around.
SIMPLE DEMS SAW DURING DEBATE ONE: Joe Biden cannot inflate a balloon.
That's bad linguish to a teacher putting teacher out of the role that is playing. President Trump said Biden called African-Americans super-predators. The BBC coverage of the debate is terrible being a blog with pages on past articles,
you Must coach Trump to be more patient in debate to let Biden get into flailing mode before he jumps in. Next moderator is a true LeftWinger who will be worse than Wallace
“Will you just shut up” Joe Biden
Biden been in office for 47 years and hasn’t done shit but now he wants us to believe he will do something, yea ight. Only thing he gonna do is kiss his grandchildren on the lips and sniff women hair.
This reminds me of people disappearing in photos in Back to the Future. Which, incidentally, could work as a Biden campaign slogan.
Let’s get one thing straight, I’m not voting for Biden.   This election is a joke, but it’s also important.   GET OUT AND VOTE
Commission on Presidential Debates Issues Statement after Last Night’s Trump-Biden Debate    #Campaign2020 #debates
We should all vote for Biden simply off the fact that he is actually a politician.  Having money can get you literally anywhere. Ex: Trump as POTUS.  So can we please give the job to someone who actually cares about the role of POTUS.  Someone who actually can be a vessel for us.
Trump was so barbaric last night.  He couldn’t even follow the rules he agreed to following. The interruption’s, the talking over everyone, that low blow about Biden’s sons. Very low class behavior  The poor moderator Omg I know he poured up done scotch straight after the debate.
Biden isn’t gonna do anything he’s gonna keep it like it is the basic racism we know. Trump is actively going to make it worse than when they burst into peoples houses shooting up all the black people you’re “shows his cards” argument leaves more of our brothers dead
Biden wearing a wire?  Doesn’t look like a shirt crease to me
It was a long time ago and Joe Biden was probably kinda racist this isn’t big news but Trump is Viciously racist and he emboldened his other racists he told white supremacist to stand back and standby as if he’s leading the army so get out of here with that

At what point did Biden forget who his son was? Biden was talking about how tRUMP disrespects the troops, BAEU Biden was a troop before he passed from cancer. TRUMP (#TrumpIsARacist ) brought up Hunter because reasons? Coz Trump had no plan except to be shit
Andrea Mitchell asked the question about Biden calling Trump a clown, WHAT. Trump calls ladies nasty and ugly / he uses profanity/ he abuses ladies and calls everyone names. Trump is disgusting and disrespectful: he shouldn’t be called a clown. Andrea, maybe you should go home.
First of all, no one wants you as a leader. Stop projecting.   Second, only you use immature name calling like “loser.”   Third, you literally refer to Bernie as “Crazy Bernie” and just disrespected Biden by calling him “Sleepy Joe.”

My take on this: It was African Americans who chose Biden over Sanders. So, now, if they end up with four more years of White Supremacy on steroids, so be it. They have nobody to blame except themselves.
Biden sums it up nicely here...
Yea...and Joe Biden went to Delaware State
I mean, you called this TV (so Telemundo viewers could ask Biden questions) a teleprompter.  Sooooo, yea.
Hearing Biden say he’s proud of his son for overcoming his addiction to cocaine, just made me happy but so sad at the same time. Kids are off limits, no matter how old they are. Trump is disgusting. I can’t believe you guys elected this man president.
Joe Biden came to debate Tuesday night; "President" Trump came to launch a food fight.
What I’m getting after catching up on it post-debate:  Trump is every bit the pompous jerk we knew him to be.  Biden lacks the mental capacity to be president and refuses to answer key questions.  Chris Wallace sacrificed a lot of his integrity.   The next 4 years look rough.
“I am the Dem Party now!” So own it. Biden allows anarchists Antifa (idea not org) and BLM marxists to burn/loot/injure.  pulls up THIS! Now you know his 💰supply.   NO to Green New Deal &amp; Manifesto. Oops!
is up to the task. She will keep him in his proper place &amp; we'll hear Biden's plans. Or, he will spiral out of control &amp; spew racist misogynist slurs openly on live TV &amp; will lose even more (suburban, white) votes. #VoteHimOut #Debates2020

It was a disaster on the debate. But I'm leaning towards Joe Biden. The president can't function well under pressure. He was getting personal.
However, if that is the new format, I wish Trump would just wait for his to minutes to clean Bidens clock, and let Biden stand there and make a fool of himself uninterrupted!
When did they start with not being able to respond to attacks? Biden was on full force attack mode and Trump wasn't able to defend the comment? What did Biden say he would do for the American people?
His handlers are telling Biden what to say. Nobody but Trump tells Trump what to say. Biden reminds me of the great OZ. Just need to pull back the curtain.
They bickered on who should appoint the next Supreme Court justice, their stances on health care and even brought each other's families into the fray.
BIDEN is the murderer.  You think that he will make this country "great" again? If he is elected,  we will be a socialist country.

Biden's, but it took everything he had to get through this debate. Why no urine test Joe? What's he hiding? Earcheck as well? If you have nothing to hide. Biden answers no questions 🙄
Chris and he favored Biden, Trump should have let Biden hang himself.
I’m sure it will be much better than the health plan that was Crammed down our throats during Obama/ Biden years. And with our President you will see it before it’s passed. You know no passing the bill to see what’s in it...
Biden and Kamala ..they really fakin it till they make it..what are the doing for black people ? What plans ?
I didn’t like him at all ! He was light on Biden and heavy on the President, seemed disrespectful at times . Ran interference for Biden all night !

I also think Chris Wallace ran interference for Biden !
That part was very confusing and unresolved. Biden never clarified how his strategy would have been any different, just that Trump was bad.
Joe Biden should not be in a Presidential debate as name signifies it would be for Presidents &amp; all he was before was a VP and nothing close to being Presidential. So change the name next time from Presidential debate to something else closer to Debate of Candidates for President
Already voted for Biden.  Tonight’s debate strengthened my decision to vote for Biden.  Go vote.
According to  nope, impossible.
The cognitive dissonance it requires to love Trump and accuse Biden of being a child molester is truly astounding.
So folks, tell it.  Who do you think “won” this debate?  I believe Biden handled him very well.  It was obvious to me who the next president should be.
Idiot celebrities and their love affair with Biden and Socialism!!!
I’m honestly and wholeheartedly proud of Joe Biden for being the statesman even when he utterly disgraced his dead son👏🏿 Lead by grace not hate!
Joe wholehearted believe America is a Organization and that another Organization can provide the Debate with different numbers which he depends on. Way to go Joe WALK THAT MILE IN OTHERS SHOES! Biden must kinder to the UK British Organisational words.
Insults only came from Biden, name one time trump threw out an insult...
Did Trump say that Biden wants to get rid of cows?  I seem to recall him saying that, but it's so absurd and ... Nevermind.  It's Trump.  And I know he said it.  Wow.
In a trainwreck Debate, its not much of a victory for Biden.  But its one of the few he can enjoy, if he can enjoy it.  So let the old man have it for what its worth.
y’all remember when Joe Biden said during the primary saying “don’t vote for me”?
biden should’ve went in on trump ass
NOT HIM DOING THIS. TRUMP LITERALLY ASKED BY BIDEN AND A FOX NEWS HOST TO CONDEMN WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND HE DOESN’T. THE RACISM REVEALS ITSELF
biden wasn’t wrong with the “clown” remark. for a businessman, tonight reeked of how truly unprofessional 45 really is.
If there were people that went into this thinking Biden and Trump were cut from the same cloth they came out the other end knowing that was a lie.  We cannot put our country through four more years of this.
I can’t even fault Joe Biden for this shit show. The President (if you can call him that) brought the shit and Chris Wallace just brought the show.
I think Trump did a great job debating both Chris Wallace and Joe Biden.
Or maybe because they sense the Fragility of Biden now?
Politics aside, Joe Biden’s humanity and ability to be vulnerable about the struggles of his life is a testament to his faith and something to admire.
I believe he already did..he deamed the KKK as a terrorists organization.   Joe Biden couldn't answer crucial questions tonight. I wonder why...
Joe Biden responded to ugliness with decency and showed us all what a president could be.  Who cares if he stumbled on some words, he’s elderly after all, it’s expected.
President Trump , why , because he is a Great President, who actually cares about the American People! Joe Biden is not up to running this country . President Trump has gotten so much done and he has taken incoming the entire time !
Trump would have been better off letting Biden trip himself up but he never got the chance because he kept interrupting
You’re right. I’m just curious as to how they can read all the word for word racist (directly towards African Americans) statements that Biden has made...but yet Trump is racist for what he didn’t say in response to a white supremacy question. Ppl are mad he didn’t say something
Keep that shit street Biden. Don’t come on here with allat
The Antifa Idea Not Organization per Biden sure burnt down a lot of towns
Why didn't Biden take a piss test? You see how humiliating that is? Why ? Why, why wouldn't he?
If you liked Trump, you had mixed feelings but thought he did well.  If you liked Biden, you had mixed feelings but thought he did well.  If you liked Wallace... wait aminute?
From my various social media feeds it appears as though there were 3 debates tonight:  1. Trump showed what he was made of despite debating both his opponent &amp; the moderator. 2. The future of America depends upon Biden. 3. The whole thing was a dumpster fire.  #debates
Joe Biden and Donald Trump when they won’t stop talking to each other.
Ruh Ro. Biden says He’s the Democrat Party now. Doesn’t support Green New Deal. No Manifesto!
boyyyyy Biden handed you your ass tonight!!!
Joe Biden? Sure, he could have done better.   Chris Wallace? He could have done a lot better, but look at what he was dealing with from Trump.  Donald Trump told the Proud Boys to stand by, and failed to condemn white supremacists. I just wanna point that out.
Is deciding he is the lessor of two evils the same as supporting?  Trump is an ass, but Biden is a shell.   Are you saying Biden is an ideal for the future?
Well if you prefer leaders like KP OLI ,who is limited to words, then Biden is not the answer.
Did anyone else notice Biden looking at his podium Reading his response?
Donald Trump isn’t running against Joe Biden.   Donald Trump is running against the election.
Horrific moderation. We thought Candy Crowley was biased but CHRIS Wallace wins by gazillion miles. His rudeness to President whine kid gloving Biden was atrocious
You shouldn’t want my take, but here it is: Not many minds weren’t changed. Trump won law and order and green new deal, Biden won health care and Covid. But all Biden really needed to do was to not be senile on stage, and he wasn’t. So yeah, Biden won.   #debates
I only caught the end and it was them just shouting over each other and not answering the question. But you see biden appeals to the camera and audience as where trump is very defensive and sticks to his guns. Two very different approaches. I just hate politics in modern america.
Biden won that debate just because Trump lacked a crowd and self control.
Trump bc he had to debate Wallace and Biden.  is about to lose a viewer
Those other people are not even on the ticket, so why are you mentioning them. Vote for the country, which means vote for Biden. Be responsible. What are you trying to prove?
To be clear, I’m voting against Trump, but I have a ton of respect for Biden after that. Dealing with Trump is fucking exhausting.
wait is the clock on biden’s side broke i just timed one of his “2 min” at 4:36 sec before trump finally budged in 😂
I actually would like someone to ask Biden what progressive policies he DOES support. #Debates2020
All I gotta say is if you watched this debate and still believe Biden your a “stupid bastard” lol
Also, notice how DJT keeps coming back to the same attacks on Biden’s “47 years” and how beholden he is to the “radical” left (hahaha) and the typical business about him being a victim of the liberal media. It’s the same playbook and he’s drilling these messages in. #Debates2020
won’t listen to a word you say after your ‘friend’ Wallace debates Trump at every turn and covered Biden. Disgraceful!
Moderator: “President Trump you have two minutes to talk uninterrupted”  Biden: *speaks* Moderator: “let Mr. VP speak”  This debate is biased because they know Biden can’t keep up.
Biden is just gonna F-off the Left tonight.
So Chris Wallace, is helping Trump by explaining how Chris read Biden's plan, and asked specific question on the policy.  When did he ask Trump about his direct policy? Does Trump have one?
Great news  Joe Biden is going to stop hurricanes!
Former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump will be in the same room Tuesday for the first presidential debate.
Joe Biden Said He Can’t Have A Debate With That “clown” his words😂
He’s been awful. Biden’s babysitter.
Biden pulled strings to get his son in the military and he didn't last a month before he got the boot for being a coke head.
CHRIS Wallace was a disgrace tonight. He debated  more than Biden. He covered Biden’s fumbles, rudely lectured a sitting president while carrying Joe. We knew it would be biased but this display was obscene
Joe Biden gettin R*ped
This debate just reinforces for me that the election is all about Trump. Love him or hate him and which side has more. No one is voting for Biden. No one cares about Biden, which is bad for Trump.
If i was Joe Biden son i would pull up on DT sons with it on the tuck nigga foh lmaoooo id spark some shit
Trump, he tries to answer, Biden just distracts
I’ve timed it. Biden gets over 3 mins and Trump is cut off as Wallace debates Trump himself.
Man if you don’t shut the fuck up are we seriously taking down points for Trump based off of Joe Biden’s sons cocaine usage? IS THAT HOW WEAK OUR PRESIDENT IS?
Biden wants the gloves🥊 let em go a couple rounds
I find the well scripted raising of Biden's dead son as a gotcha in a debate distasteful, and I'm glad Trump made it about the other son.
THIS MAN JUST WENT IN ON BIDEN’S DECEASED SON, YALL, I CANNOT
He keeps bringing up Biden’s son, but how much have his kids gotten from the American people due to his nepotism. #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden said don’t speak on his mf son or it’s gon be problems bih !  And that’s that !
Every time Trump has Biden on the ropes  Wallace changes the topic. What an absolute disgrace as a moderator. We knew you’d carry Joe’s water but your rudeness to our President is astonishing.
BIDEN OR TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY! 🗣🗣
I'd rather hear Trump and Biden yelling over each other than Chris Wallace yelling over both of them.
'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' Talk Show: 'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' FactChecking Biden’s SCOTUS S...
Biden didn’t even answer the original question, so I’m taking it as No he doesn’t support “BLM” 🤦🏽‍♂️ yea we screwed either way !!!
Biden's argument of I'm only running for office not in office so I can't answer questions about court packing or violence is weird.
Biden don’t wanna defend the police but he the only one we got bye
Chris Wallace perpetuating the “good people in both sides” LIE and calling CRT “racial sensitivity training” and Biden calling Trump a racist and talking about dog whistles is disgusting. #PresidentialDebate
it wouldn’t matter anyway. he already doing it to Biden.
I’m all for Biden, but my man, suburbs are not integrated now. #Debates2020
Biden's falling into the insult trading trap Trump sets in every debate.
After tonight   Donald Trump   Joe Biden   God 🗳✅  #PresidentialDebate  #2020debate  #Trump2020 #Trump #debate  #BidenHarris2020 #debates
Trump is racist. If you support him or hate on Biden you are too or racism just doesn’t bother you that much.
New drinking game- everytime Biden stutters or forgets what the topic is drink.
Trump said Biden can’t say “law enforcement” or he’d lose his supporters. I want Trump to say Black Lives Matter and see how many supporters he lose.
Biden said "You need to shut up, man."  That was the only rational thing I have heard.
SPOT ON!!! Joe Biden on George Floyd.
Yes and it’s going just like I thought it would , Joe Biden is getting the baby treatment from Wallace !
If Chris Wallace wanted to be Biden's running mate, he should have had a sex change. #PresidentialDebate
Biden called Trump a clown 😂 they could’ve did this on twitter 😂
Biden definitely doesn’t want to talk about Hunter!
The left is falling back on how proud they are that "Biden is restrained," which tells you how badly Trump is running over him.
Trump = gun, Biden = knife #boomboom
We need somebody like an AOC to come in and light the set on fire. Biden is operating on the old rules.
Trump PLEASEEE let Biden Speak!!!
Exactly what I just told my husband ! Biden is jacked up on something!
Wonder what 'La Resistance' is gonna think about that.  They definitely will not be happy with that quote from Biden.
I think it’s clear that Biden is neither on debate-enhancing drugs nor standing there with an earpiece in. #PresidentialDebate
Biden is winning so far
So the 'Hey Fat' Biden showed up tonight.  The potential for this to be closer and or Trump losing a debate because of this was forecasted awhile back.  Will it be enough for the election?  I think not.  The riots have already decided that.
s much for the colleague and friend Wallace being invisible tonight. He’s been debating Trump and protecting Biden for 45 min.
Biden just isn't the pit bull this moment calls for.
Besides this debate being an embarrassment, Trump cannot handle Biden laughing at him. Also, quite strategic how they try to undercut each other's talking time.
Not watching this debate right now but looks like Biden wins ok take me to tomorrow oh wait it's just more Covid times
Whatever taxes Trump paid in 2016 was based on the tax policies of the Obama/Biden administration. Don't get this argument.
We all knew Trump was gonna out talk Biden because he’s has no conscious about cappin. No need to drag Biden on the TL tho. It’s not productive fam.
Mr. President  give Mr.Biden room to make his own mistakes.  Try and limit your interjections sir.
Weirdly hoping Biden rips off his jacket, loosens his tie, rolls up his sleeves and starts throwing hands. Simply because I’m certain Trump will flee.
Biden kilt me when he said this the same man said you can put bleach in your arm 😂😂😂
President Trump is trolling Biden something serious rigt now and I am here for it. Let him live man! Let him live 🤣
Trump is clowning on Biden’s hair smellin ass lmaoo
Donald is literally attacking how often Biden wears a mask... umm okay? and that’s supposed to be a bad thing??
is trump gone let Biden talk damn
And Biden is the former VP. Not Mr. Vice President. That’s Pence
Donald Trump is a fucking lunatic and Joe Biden gave us the slogan of 2020 with "will you shut up man".
Biden looks so much more feeble than he did four years ago. He's really aged.
Did Biden just drop tRumps bleach advice? 🤣🤣. Biden is kicking it out of the park for me.  💙💙💙.
“Will you shut up man” -VP Biden
Biden pulling his laughing trick.
Biden said "Will you just shit up, man?"
Is there a big teleprompter in the back for Biden sisal bc he is very fixed back there
Biden ain’t playing with Trump lmaooooo #Debates2020
NIGGA Biden said shut up😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Biden is already irritated. Come on, Joe, keep it together.. PLEASE
Trump keep interrupting Biden omg ! Let the man talk shitttt #PresidentialDebate2020
I still don't know why Biden agreed to this clown-show.
Trump is eating Biden up 🥴
Take a shot every time Trump interrupts Biden #PresidentialDebate #Debates2020
They can’t control Trump, omg. Biden needs to take the same approach.
#Biden just called tRUMP a clown 🤡🤡🤡🤡I was already voting for him but he also has my respect as well.  💙💙#debate #VoteHimOut #2020
Biden just refused to answer Court Packing question. “Will you shut up, Man” to Trump
Wallace is so pro Biden it’s sickening
Debate drinking game: take a shot every time Trump says something crazy and Joe Biden looks at the camera &amp; smiles like he’s on The Office
Biden said “You picked the wrong guy, on the wrong night, at the wrong time.” 😂😂🤣 #Debates2020

Disgusting choice tonight:  with his Let’s talk thru the debate panel of Never Trumpers Pirino, Juan and debate cheat Donna Brazile they so adore now or Never Trump  blather. Pretty soon Never Trump Chris Wallace begins his subtle skew to support Biden.
Bruh...if Joe Biden were f***in' comatose, I'd still vote for him over that vat of dumpster juice.
I'm kinda hoping Biden wanders into a wall while blabbering jibberish and Trump gets an epid nose bleed. This would make 2020 worthwhile.
One thing this app has taught me, latte liberals are not necessary friends to the agenda of Minorities. Seen too much Joe Biden slander. If you think you’re taking some kind of courageous stance by not voting for either candidate, we can’t be friends. 💯
Meghan will vote Trump even though he shit on her father an deer mother is on Biden's transition team. Don't forget Meghan's husband runs a right wing propaganda website. She will vote party over country guaranteed

I'm going to watch, but it will probably be the only one. I still can't believe that it will actually happen. I am sure that Biden is napping.
This is better than any Trump or Biden spot I’ve seen. I’m voting SIZZLER.

It appears that Judge Sullivan is protecting Obama and Biden about something. The judge personally redacted the exculpatory information that had been withheld by the FBI. He is apparently going to sit on this information until after the election-- maybe longer.
Does it shock anyone that Biden has released his tax returns while Trump hasn't?

Lol, Trump lies: Stop picking on him. Trump is fraud who doesn’t pay taxes: what about Biden? Trump has corrupted the DOJ: Why doesn’t Biden take questions? Poor ole Donny T can’t catch a break.
Tell Trump to kick Biden's ass while you're there today! We have our popcorn ready
Rumor mill has it that most of MSM is gonna name Biden winner of debates, already.
Tonight is the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. The debate in Cleveland, OH will be divided into six segments of approximately 15 minutes each. Here's a look at the preselected topics the candidates will be discussing.
You don’t have to go further than Biden’s campaign manager for vulgarity. What is it with progressives and the fascination with urine?

Omg I got my popcorn 🍿 and my phone ready to record the spectacle we are about to see with this debate (Trump &amp; Biden).  🍿🍿🍿🍿c
In 2017, the Bidens income jumped from $396,552 to $9,578,639, according to their tax return from that year ($8M from their book deal). Joe and Jill Biden paid $3,742,974 in federal taxes on that income and owed the IRS $1,666 after filing their taxes, according to the return.
The Bidens paid $3.9M in 2017 off $9M in income.  Trump paid $750 dollars.... dollars!  Save your fake, misinformed rage.
If trump is as rich as he "claims" he would be 30X more rich than Biden. The Biden's paid $3.9M in taxes in 2017, Trump paid $750.
In 2017, the Bidens income was $9,578,639. Joe and Jill Biden paid $3,742,974 in federal taxes on that income and owed the IRS $1,666 after filing their taxes, according to the return.   Got any sources for your wild claims?
If you believe that Trump is as rich ad he says he is (I definitely do not), Biden is worth a fraction of what trump "claims." But I bet Biden paid more than $750 in taxes.
My sister had  brain aneurisms is like a parrot ,she will repeat same thing over &amp; over , Sad   let’s see Biden  could take steroid shot  be active &amp; speak faster   easy to spot   I really wish people would think about USA &amp; not vote 4–2 Frontal lobe brain  injury Biden  Trump 🇺🇸
Our new AG if Biden gets elected!  God save us!
How did Biden Help you personally?
Trump doesn't get to dictate shit for this debate. The people dictate the rules, if he doesn't want to play by those rules (which he doesn't), Biden can have the time to address America
It’s disingenuous to ask this question when repeatedly Biden/ Harris have laid out their plans. This is an excuse for the same “I’m undecided give me attention “ nonsense. It’s like saying “some one tell me why I shouldn’t eat dung”
'TELL IT LIKE IT IS' Talk Show: Former Vice President Joe Biden Braces for Trump T...
The media works for the DNC and Hunter is Biden's son. Duh.
I don't see how Biden can go through with the debate. Biden will have to cancel the debate. COVID-19 will be as good as an excuse as any.
Wallace will be in the tank for Biden, but this will bring out the best in Trump. Americans like a fighter and fair play.
⚡️ “Five things to watch in the first Trump-Biden debate” by
Y'all ready? #RidinWithBiden
Biden has 47 years experience in "swamp speak"  Expect 2 hours of Biden whining in abstract generalities about "Orange Man" bad!  It's going to be mentally taxing!  Anything less than his 4th stroke will be declared a Biden victory in the most glorious terms by the MSM  #MAGA2020
when was the last time Biden took more in grifting than the salary he donated back?  Asking for a friend... BTW say 'hi' to the Manhattan DA
Times says unverified  we all know you pay taxes all year &amp; owe  end  This is ridiculous Biden uses same unverified info  #ChinaJoe #JoeChina   Brain aneurism Biden can’t run Country
Hats off to Ridge. PA is critical to Biden’s election where the polls seem to be a lot tighter than Michigan and Wisconsin
If Joe Biden was drooling and wearing a hospital gown at the debates the MSM would say he was an intelligent , high fashion man😂
Biden could be drooling and in a hospital gown and mother would change his supporters. Ya really think this will change Trump supporters. Dream on.
WOW. Ok so he’s going to vote because after 47 years biden is now going to do something? No he’s voting for kamala harris and the extreme left she brings with her. I thought you had some common sense. No longer a fan.
This is indeed America, it means people have a right to voice their opinion on Mr. Johnson's public endorsement of Biden.  RTR
Apparently he built those things with UNTAXED MONEY FOR TWENTY YEARS and then decided to pay $750 the year he was elected! So, the question is, what did  build? A public record of tax returns, school transcripts, &amp; wd provide DNA if ordered. Next?
I pray that God will see favor over you and Kamala. Dear Mr. Biden, please lay out your platform for America once you become s President! Don’t focus on our crooked President and crooked Mitch! Please have a strong outlined platform on how you can repair the 4 years of damage.
As 47% became a significant number in 2012, $750 could become the memorable figure in this election.  But just like the ET tape, know that Trump will attack hard out the gate in this upcoming debate. Biden better be ready.
Biden is disgusting. how dare he equate Goebbels with   how low will Biden stoop
Biden’s team is hiding his decline.   that and they’re switching his days to nights in hopes that he’ll do better with the debates.
So did his accusers. They all have tax attorneys/accountants who use every aspect of law to reduce tax liability. Nothing illegal. They wrote the tax code and Trump used every inch of it. Smart man! Bezos, Zuckerberg, Gates, Twit Jack, Pelosi, Feinstein, Schumer, Biden, OBAMA
Senate Report Accuses Hunter Biden Of Possibly Using Trafficked Hookers.  We already know he’s partial to them along with coke
You’ll pay even more if ya boy Biden gets in
Agree, it’s not an ideal ticket, but we have to stop the bleeding. Dems needed someone that could win an election, and Biden offered the best chance.
None. That was my point. Look, among the Dem candidates, Biden  the best a conservative can do if they simply can’t stomach voting for Trump again.
So you are saying you would have voted for Bernie/Warren/Pete/Yang but not Biden? So many champions of small government in that group, lol. So you are sitting this one out, yes?
He’s the gift that keeps on giving.⁦
Biden is just a LIAR, period
We  know that military families and vets value duty, honor, and sacrifice. It’s why such a traditionally conservative group is increasingly breaking for Biden. Join us today!
And Biden is better? He doesn't even support our military. Y'all need to wake up and realize that Biden will destroy this country.

I totally recommend therapy! We will see how "good" Biden is once Trump embarrasses him Tuesday night...it's gonna be hillarious!
But you support Joe Biden who's mentors were members of the ku Klux Klan. To each his own.
Well that puts Joe Biden in the same position with Trump because he's also a pathological liar just look at his record and statements.
People would try and cancel Jesus if he baptized Trump!!! Enough with the foolishness I'm not going to cancel anybody because they're voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden: fine, that’s easy only after you release your tax returns
great way to put it: if Dems win it will be Harris Administration with Guest Star Biden
Vote Biden for Censorship
Precisely. We have a choice between 4 more years of Trump or 8 years of Biden/Harris &amp; then 4 or 8 years of Trump 2.0. We can't wait 12 or 16 years to turn this country around. 4 more years of Trump &amp; folks will be begging for change....real change.

Oh hi Laura bunch of numbers I don’t fucking like Biden I think he’s a corporate puppet but trump is actively hinting at a coup so I think Biden is the better choice rather than the complete idiot who rubs elbows with nazis and pedos
You May get a big disappointment at debate when Chris Wallace  lets Joe skate on bad answers or fails to hit him hard like he will Trump. I’m expecting Wallace to debate Trump For Biden. What he says will cue Joe’s answers.
Better have someone at debate check Joe Biden for an earpiece! Seriously. We know HRC got ?? ahead off time  as we bet Joe does too. First time topics announced in advance. Never Trump  Chris Wallace giving Joe to me to memorize ans
Neither Biden nor Graham is not a good person.

OK who is to pay for the Canadian Voting Machines this time, when  Biden/Obama ran once George Soros paid for them. I hear Biden been getting money from Ukraine &amp; Russia, I am guessing he already paid them but how can they arrive in the USA.
Did someone make those for Joe Biden &amp; Harris, how sweet they look together Like a TikTok ready to go BOIN hypothetically of course since its not about large breasts but rather a watch that is flying into hundreds of pieces like it has finally expended its time.
Same in Montgomery. We drove all around on Sunday and saw many Jones and Biden signs and 3 for TT. 2/3 were on the same property but perpendicular streets of a corner lot. The only Trump sign we saw was for sale in a parking lot.That is your choice....not mine!! Have fun paying all the increased taxes and enjoy Big Government and eventual socialism if Biden wins! Your choice!
Hell, no. Trump would have doubled down on the negative ads. Would anyone have been surprised?  But, Biden has taken the high road on this situation. Nobody can come back later and complain that Biden was kicking a man when he was down.
I watched her say she hopes Joe Biden “”takes the high road”😂🤣
Not surprised Mr. Riegel, not surprised at all Cheeto's people aren't pulling their ads.  Biden's a class act and it shows
My nigga joe Biden finna win by default 😂😂😭😭 #Debates2020
Joe Biden didn’t get exposed to the Trump contagion spray.
The first thought I had this morning after hearing the news that Trump has COVID was “If he infected Joe Biden at the debate the other night, I’m going to be extra pissed!” Trump is such an incredibly horrible leader especially with the example he sets by his actions.
I’m for Biden/Harris but I hope trump &amp; Melanie are okay. I hope you and yours are okay. I hope    are okay. Y’all hang in there ♥️🇺🇸
OR - a zoom meeting debate where they can mute his dumbass when Biden is speaking
Focus on facts Serge. So far Biden is lying. He’s unable to lead the country. I know that and you know that. There’s no other option for the USA but Donald J Trump. Biden is a racist joke.
Replace the second presidential debate with a Joe Biden Town Hall. America will be okay with this. I certainly will be.
I could agree with that statement. But as you stated there would be a transition period for the industry with a Biden win which could last 6-12 months. A trump would be immediate rebound. Since we are talking options, I stand by my statement.
But if Biden wins, those calls will go to zero, along with XLE

Save some for the  #Debates2020 .  "While attending college, he served as an intern in the office of Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden, …."
Does it matter that the next debate moderator worked for Biden?
Has Joe Biden denounced Democrat Communists yet? 😬
Serge, you are unable to control your emotions on Twitter. Try real debate. We’ll see how you can handle it 😂
Joe Biden is having a time on this train tour. Thousands of people are masked and too energized and excited to see him. 💙
From an observation: I get excited that people in their F-150s support Joe Biden. Whenever I see ppl in their pickups, I think of Donald Trump. I rode through some neighborhoods and saw these types parked in a driveway with Biden signs on their front lawn.
Biden and Doug Jones support in Downtown Huntsville in this middle class district. 💙💙💙
Lie’n Biden at it again . Stupidest human ever paraded out
Trump allowed Biden to paint him as a heartless millionaire/billionaire.   DT missed huge swing to hit back that Biden is a multimillionaire and earned $950k last year with no career except “public service”
Trump, Biden Square Off on Policing, Pandemic, Economy in First Presidential Debate  via
Dammmnnnn. That was fast. 🤯 Donald thought he had this group wrapped around his finger and instead Joe Biden gets this endorsement. 😳
Fact check: Joe Biden is correct
Give Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot a landslide victory so there will be no way for Trump to claim that he really won the election.
If Biden ain’t coming with this energy to the next debate he might as well not show up at all.
Biden will rock his shit🤣🤣
I have already voted for our new President, Joe Biden.
Whew... if they would have just left them fight fight BIDEN WOULD HAVE GOT HIM! 😩😩🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 HE WAS MAD ABOUT HIS SON, ION BLAME HIM.
Nawl frfr.. explain this part to me how was Biden responsible 🤔  47 years of vice president 🤔  HOW SWAY? HHHOOOWWW?? #Debates2020
Amazing that people think he has any pull in this government. WHERE’S THE BIDEN ACTION!?   The guy can’t do shit unless people. Let him in 😂
you could see all on biden face that he wanted to come across that stage on 45
As a recovering addict myself, Joe Biden became my hero tonight when he turned to the camera &amp; said “my son had a drug problem, &amp; he over came it” that meant so much to me!
Biden mostly did well, but occasionally he let his mid-Atlantic upbringing get the best of him. "Shut up, man."
What she said. Voting for Biden is not a panacea, but it will at least slow the bleeding. #Debates2020
Biden after they walk out the debate #2020PresidentialDebate
Biden: "Yes. We'll count the ballots as you pointed out.... If there are thousands of ballots, we'll take the time to count them"  Trump interjects with some BS. Biden: "He has no idea what he's talking about." #Debates2020
Wallace correctly points out that the biggest problem with mail-in ballots is rejection due to improperly filled-out ballots, etc, which is correct.  Biden talks about identity verification but doesn't address incorrectly filled-out ballots. #Debates2020
Oh, I know, but let's be honest. Biden COULD use that same ammo against Trump  But she ALWAYS seems far more prepared. Plus a much better speaker...
Biden correctly says "There is no evidence of that" bullshit about unsolicited ballots and that 5 states (2 red) have been doing vote by mail for decades  #Debates2020
No one but I'm 100% certain you're boy Chris Wallace lost. He's awful. Totally in the tank for Biden. Disgraceful.
Joe Biden with the zinger.   “When all is counted and I win, it’s all over.”   Spicy Joe. 🔥🔥🔥
That closing statement from Biden was 🔥🔥🔥.
Biden correctly describes Trump's rhetoric as voter suppression (without using the word suppression) #Debates2020
Biden correctly points out that there's no evidence of mail-in ballots being a source of systemic fraud and that Trump does it. #Debates2020
Biden: "I can't remember which of his rants you're talking about." Wallace: "I'm having a little trouble myself."  #Debates2020
If Biden wins, XLE is going to -1000
Biden, when asked about differences in drawing a line on economy vs the planet: "He hasn't drawn a line" #Debates2020
Biden when you said he is absolutely wrong.. you sounded like trump 😒
Wallace points out Biden would limit but not abolish fracking. How long before Trump tries to claim the reverse? #Debates2020
Next time Trump interrupts, can Biden just say, "Person, woman, man, TV, camera" because this dude canNOT remember the debate rules. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020
#Debates2020 EX-FUCKING- ACTLY .. IT HAPPENED UNDER YOU 😩😩 GET HIM BIDEN 😒😤😤😤
The fact that it went to Biden’s sons... this needs to be shut down
I KNOW TRUMP AINT TALKING BOUT BIDEN’S KIDS !!
#Debates2020 COME ON BIDEN... TELL HIM WHERE HE FAILED AT!!
Trump tries to claim Hunter was dishonorably discharged for cocaine use. Biden denies it.  #Debates2020
Wallace: "Your side agreed to it [2 minutes of uninterrupted answering]."  Biden: "He never keeps his word."  Wallace: "That was rhetorical."  #Debates2020
Biden: "Everybody in your administration who tells you the truth has a bad idea"  #Debates2020
Trump: "Almost everything I see is from the left wing"  When confronted with white supremacists, he pivots back to antifa.  Biden: "Antifa is an idea, not an organization."  #Debates2020
He hates Trump more than he cares about anything else. His hatred is deep and strong when it comes to Trump and its been evident for a while. He keeps jumping in to save Biden tonight. It's disgusting.
Wallace to Biden: have you ever called Wheeler or Brown and said you have to stop this shit in Portland?  Biden: "I don't hold public office now... the violence should be prosecuted."  #Debates2020
Trump claims Biden has no law enforcement support. "We have time." Biden: "We don't have time"  Wallace shifts to protests. #Debates2020
"What does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the #BlackLivesMatter call for community control of police?" Biden: "I'm totally opposed to defunding local police forces"  THAT is how you lose your "radical left" followers, Joe.  #Debates2020
I love Joe Biden. Yes I said it.
Biden: he wouldn't know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn  #Debates2020
Wallace: "Is [the increase in violent crimes in both blue and red cities] a party issue?"  Trump: proceeds to talk only about Chicago, claims Biden will lose his "radical left supporters" and will abolish suburbs. #Debates2020
mannnn Biden has every right to go walk over to Trump and smack the taste outta him 🥱
Biden: "Law and order with justice where people are treated fairly." then points out crime stats under his administration  "Mr. President, you're going to be happy because we're going to be talking about law and order."  #Debates2020
Biden: something something unity.  Trump: there was hatred and division in the Obama administration. "Frankly it was more violent than what we're seeing now."  Biden: "This is ridiculous."  #Debates2020
Back to violence being "never appropriate"  Trump tries to bait Biden on "What is peaceful protest?"  Wallace shuts him the hell down. #Debates2020
On to Breonna Taylor. Biden says the vast majority of cops are decent people but "there are some bad apples."  HAS LITERALLY EVERYONE FORGOTTEN THE SECOND HALF OF THAT IDIOM? Those bad apples spoil the rest of them!  #Debates2020
Are Biden's meds wearing off? #Debates2020
"What he did has been disastrous for the African-American community."  Trump brings up the 1994 crime bill, saying "they've never forgotten it."  Then why did Biden clean the fuck up with Black voters in the primaries?  #Debates2020
Biden is on a roll calling out Trump's racism. #Debates2020
Biden: "We've never walked away from trying to accomplish equity for everyone."  I can think of 3/5 of a reason why that's blatantly false.  #Debates2020
Chris Wallace is on Team Biden. He hates Trump more than he loves anything.
Trump keeps interrupting Biden denying allegations of Hunter's corruptions. "He doesn't want to let me answer because he knows the truth" and points out everyone who has discredited those allegations. Trump won't shut up. #Debates2020
"He talks about the great trade deals he's done. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal."  Trump: "China ate your lunch" and brings up Hunter Biden, makes claims about Hunter's corruption, which Biden denies.  #Debates2020
Biden touts bringing back Chrysler and GM. "They're gone. He blew it."  #Debates2020
I think we know why,  🤫 (in whisper voice) It's because Chris Wallace is on Biden's side. 😐
Trump keeps interrupting Biden. Biden lets him do it. "This guy"  #Debates2020
Biden talks about raising corporate taxes (which are much needed).  Trump: why didn't you do it when you were VP? Biden: because you did it [lowered corp taxes] as president.  #Debates2020
"The tax code that put him in a position that he pays less than a teacher...and he does take advantage of the tax system"  Trump: Why didn't you do things over the last 25 years? Biden: You kept screwing it up. "You're the worst president America has ever had." #Debates2020
Now Wallace brings up the $750. "Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?"  He dodged the question entirely.  Biden: "show us your tax returns." Trump: "You'll see them as soon as they're finished."  WTF. #Debates2020
Trump tries to claim he has a right to rebut Biden's claims. He doesn't, but Wallace lets him walk all over him anyway. MUTE HIS SORRY ASS.  "I'm the one who brought back Big Ten football."  No you weren't, shithead. #Debates2020
Biden says Trump will become the first president with fewer jobs (in the economy) compared to when he took office in American history, which... wow. #Debates2020
Biden starts off by pointing out how millionaires and billionaires have only gotten richer in the pandemic, brings up small, working class towns and the $750 tax return. Trump interrupts... again.  #Debates2020
Trump tries to claim "nobody will show up" to Biden's smaller rallies and then inflates the size of his crowds again, tries to claim "we have had no problem whatsoever" with #COVID19 at his rallies. The ghost of Herman Cain says hi. #Debates2020
Biden points out how wearing masks until January can save 100k lives. Trump tries to say Fauci discredited himself, which... what. Yes he screwed up the early messaging.  #Debates2020
Biden is saying all this stuff about Covid and PPE as if that's not already being done as much as it can be.
Trump tries to claim Biden said the name of his own college wrong. Say what?  #Debates2020
Biden is at least classy and compassionate.  Trump is a steamroller in need of a tune up.
Joe Biden is winning this y’all. He is roasting, toasting, and shitting on this MFER. He said “Maybe injecting bleach in your arms.” 😂😂😂😂 #BidenHarris
Wallace bringing up vaccine hesitancy and asking if Biden/Harris are contributing to it. Biden addresses it pretty well, pointing out that there are lots of private scientists not subject to Trump's muzzle. #Debates2020
Biden points out that Trump said it would be gone by Easter and by summer and we should inject bleach into our arms.   Trump tries to claim it was sarcastic.   Typical right-wing horseshit. #Debates2020
Trump claims Biden did a shitty job with #h1n1. Biden points out 14k is a hell of a lot less than 200k without a shutdown.  Biden turns to the pathos argument very well.  #Debates2020
First golf dig against Trump by Biden and it's a birdie. #Debates2020
Biden starts off by counting off all the #Debates2020  stats. "Because you are who you are."  Points out the Woodward tapes. "You don't panic. He panicked."  #Debates2020   Also points for pronouncing Xi correctly.
Trump interrupts Biden again. "Will you shut up, man?" Holy fuck, Biden.  #Debates2020
Wallace weakly tries to pivot back to SCOTUS, bringing up packing the court. "Are you willing to tell the American people whether you will support ending the filibuster or packing the court?"  Biden refuses to answer, tells people to vote now. #Debates2020
"He has no plan for health care. He sends out wishful thinking."  Accurate, Biden.  #Debates2020
Trump: "He just lost the left"  After a bit of tantrums by Trump, Biden looks at Wallace: "Do you have any idea what this clown is doing?"  Well played. #Debates2020
Wallace lobs a softball at Biden asking him to shoot down a Trump talking point that the public option would end private insurance. He hits it out of the park and Trump tries to claim that it's the same thing as #m4a.   And Trump turns around and brings up Pocahontas #Debates2020
Wallace correctly calls Trump's executive order protecting pre-existing conditions "largely symbolic."  Trump: "I guess I'm debating you."  I'm with Biden in laughing at Trump's bullshit. #Debates2020
Y’all I wanna smack Trump already damn let Biden talk
Biden when he days he is t Democratic Party
Trump's trying his interruption tactics. Biden is having none of it. #Debates2020
"The 200,000 people that have died under his watch"  Keep harping on that, Biden. #Debates2020
And Trump just called Biden a socialist. That took longer than I expected. #Debates2020
Good job by Biden to pivot to healthcare in his argument as to why confirming Barrett is bad. #debates2020
alright twitter. i need your help.  my mom said she’s not sure who to vote for in november.  i need every convincing article, stat, interview, EVERY THING you’ve got to send to her to convince her to settle for biden.  idk what to do.
Trump wore those younger Republicans out in the Primaries. The DNC just picked Biden.
LOL oh so now suddenly we expect businessmen to pay more than legally obligated in taxes??? Are you serious right now? Do YOU donate to the IRS? Does ANYBODY pay more than legally required in taxes? Please find me one person who freely donates to the IRS and I will vote Biden!
I haven't live tweeted anything since my first live basketball game a few years ago. Cocktails and live-tweeting the debate tonight. "One's a senile moron who says something dumber than before. One is Joe Biden".
You mean a system made possible by representatives who have been on office for decades so they too can get away with paying next to nothing in taxes??? Like.... ohhhhh, IDK, Biden, Sanders, Clinton...
If Biden somehow wins Georgia, that has to be a symbolic game over for Trump (not a statistical one)
I don’t usually tweet about California because this is a Democratic stronghold. The last Republican to have won Cali was George H.W. Bush by double-digits in 1988. Since then, no Democrat has ever beaten a Republican in this state by 34 points. Biden could beat this man by 40.
What does Trump take to stop the tremor or to treat his weak leg? What helps him get by on 3 hours sleep so he can watch his favorite TV shows &amp; tweet. Biden looks like he’s in robust good health. Trump looks like a heart attack waiting to happen; overweight &amp; never exercises.
Hunter Biden.
Joe Biden’s tax plan would destroy 3M jobs! #KAG
made amistep get over it please😔
Biden: C’mon man, I’m gonna lay the smack down on those jabronis with the people’s elbow. Do you smell-l-l-l-l-l-l what I’m cooking?
His hardcore followers will believe Biden is doping if he doesn’t take a drug test buy who cares, they wouldn’t vote for him anyway. Doubt Trump's gambit will persuade anyone on the fence.
I will say if biden wins then it will kill the market and capital gains tax will increase heavily
2) It’s a well-known fact that Joe Biden is a devout Catholic yet Donald Trump says that Biden is against God. It’s Donald Trump who virtually never attends church and who does things every single day that are definitely not Christlike. Shame on you &amp; shame on Trump.
So a false childish attack on Biden, no legitimate argument against Biden, and more importantly a serious lack of masks showing your lack of care and caution for the people in my county.  You can stay away now.
A couple of weeks ago I tweeted that I walked past a teenager in the mall who wore a Biden-Harris hat. I gave him a thumbs up. The media portrayed that Joe couldn’t appeal to young people. This video and my encounter with that boy is proof that Gen Z loves Joe."Terrible person!" says the woman who just said natural selection might take care of Joe Biden before the election😆
Take the Supreme Court win and then whatever happens, happens. If Biden wins the house most likely red waves in 2022.
If Biden is elected, how fast will #25thAmendment be used? /s
Questions will be given to Biden in advance.
This clip of Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask on Tuesday night hasn’t aged well   IRONY? KARMA? GOD WORKING IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS? YOU DECIDE.
Why would anything happen to the stock market if Biden was down. Biden knows nothing about the stock market, the economy. He can barely read
We must VOTE like we’ve never voted before🌊🌊🌊🌊Biden/Harris 🌊🌊🌊Doug Jones US SENATE Alabama🌊🌊🌊
Fox News remember how you guys treated Joe Biden?
I don't think he would ever come out and say it, but I believe W &amp;  are also Biden supporters. Agree or disagree with W's policies, he loves our country and our people.
The official statement is that Trump is doing just fine. Time to ramp back up the negative ads. Biden needs to stop trying to be the nice guy. Fuck Trump.
The White House hid Trump's condition for over a day. Trump tested positive the day after the debate, and wasn't tested at the debate because he arrived late! The Biden campaign is entitled to ALL medical records on Trump at least from the past week.
Everyone out there with your #trump or #biden #covid19 conspiracies...chill out. For real, you guys are sounding like a bunch of Alex Jones copies. Is anyone sane anymore?
I think that or to delay the race...u see Biden took all his negative trump adds down. Most def playing chess
Also, blaming Biden for a thing that happened in '09 is like blaming Pence now. I guess logical consistency isn't your strong suit.  Not that I much care, I don't support Biden either.
What does being a gentleman have to do with the election of a president? If Trump was in the same position, he would give less than 2 shits if Biden lived or died. He would be moving at warp speed to try to unseat him. Amirite?🤔
Lee Corso is the sports worlds Joe Biden
Biden’s position is whatever his handlers tell him it is
nobody:  biden: mans don't even have a dog!
Did they autopsy Biden already?
Since the Biden-Harris campaign has suspended its ads against the Trump GOP, the GOP takes it a a new path to criticizing Biden. Instead of reciprocating, the Trump's continue to attack! They know not what they have started!
A lesson in humility and not mocking BIDEN for his BIG MASK!
I hope this spreads to Biden in November.
I’m more scared of Pence being president than any stupid thing Trump does. I already cast my ballot for Joe Biden.
I highly doubt President Trump is faking the coronavirus as part of a last resort to help himself get reelected and cover up that disaster of a debate he had with former VP Biden. That said, I can't entirely rule it out due to a lack of transparency from him and the White House.
Now is NOT THE TIME TO BLINK, BIDEN. God, it’s like we don’t WANT to win this time either. Push HARDER. Double down on his illness as a consequence. Push the death tolls, lives permanently changed, economic cost. Push every fucking policy failure in his face and down his throat.
I am seeing this the past month of so throughout the south. Also rooms are increasing price ( demand) absolutely opposite of economic forces! I see hundreds/ thousands of Trump stuff- very little Biden. Other night in a 4 star was like staying at a frat house. Someone is funding
No retreat! It's America or trump - Biden must fight for America. #TrumpIsATraitor would fight for himself.  Different times, different place - different rules for a different race.
He won’t even take them down in response to Biden taking his down

Nope. He chose optics over safety, even making fun of Biden at the debate for the size of the mask he wore. If the shoe was on the other foot, I doubt Trump would send him a case of bottled water &amp; a bottle of Advil. The game is the game &amp; he knows that. #TinyHandRhetoric
If you ever started a sentence without either the word Democrats, Biden or “I” I’d probably have a heart attack
I'm not surprised personally Democrats believe every word Joe Biden and Liberal Media outlet's say.
Pretending I said anything about contagions being "easily arrested" or the flu being "contained" seems like an exhausting exercise in goalpost moving, Joe.  Also, bold of you to assume I support Biden just because Trump and his anti-intellectualist lackeys disgust me.
Trump would dog walk Biden with negative ads if he got sick
He didn’t listen to the science last week when he mocked Biden for wearing a mask &amp; boasted about his rallies and their “safety”. His children didn’t listen to science when they all refused to wear masks at the debate. Now several WH reporters are testing positive...
Yes me too. We need him well for his court day when biden takes over.
Funny you put  “never forget” and “always remember” in the same sentence with Joe Biden...the irony🤣
yes racism does motivate me to vote. That’s why we vote Trump. How the hell do you look over Biden’s entire racist history dating back as far as the 70’s... seriously. They get blacks every time playing on heart strings. And do nothing once elected.
You are a true warrior and president pence may mention you when he pardon Trump before biden takes office.

Biden wore a mask. Trump did not.
I want Hunter Biden to beat up Donald Trump Jr...why do he mentioning Hunter like he want his dick or something
As a former journalist, I would stand up for lies about Biden or Trump. I was taught to tell the story with facts and without bias. Let the reader form their own opinion.
Fuck Trump Fuck Biden Fuck Covid. It’s all a system of lies &amp; manipulation
I’m black and a Biden supporter but I can’t rock with this tweet. Everything isn’t a conspiracy theory. It’s already enough hate in the world and you have a platform to stop the hate but otherwise use it for this? Just lost a follower

Biden can’t even acknowledge that he has dementia. Maybe his handlers haven’t told him yet.
Sorry sweetie, Biden just tested negative. Guess you and your tacky veneers will have to wait another day.
BREAKING: Biden negative
imagine if it was joe biden that got covid...   would wishing death on him be accepted, oh no.  then why is okay to do it to trump.  i've never been more disgusted by democrats, y'all should be fucking ashamed of yourselves.
Re-upping, for obvious reasons:   From August. More to come.....
I’m thinking the Biden team is kicking themselves for not thinking of it first...  perfect excuse to not have a debate.  Plus gets the sympathy of fans and, like you said, destroys the narrative.
If he gave Biden COVID after Biden’s been careful and responsible the rage will be REAL.
I get you don't like him,  I don't like Biden but I would never wish anyone Ill will... You need to think about karma never know who it will get back at
See, all the lefties who for the past few days have been nasty while accusing me of secretly being in the tank for Trump are now silent, rather than saying they were wrong.
1) Politics is tit for tat (u know).Dems call down Trump for racism, so make Biden have to explain about Byrd.Both are absurd, but if you don't, the other side wins the new cycle (and the election). BTW, I wasn't specifically referring to Byrd.
I respect Mr. Biden's stance, but I also understand why people are outraged with Trump.

I’m not a huge fan of our President. But I’m also not a fan of the ignorance among so many regarding his statements against white supremacists. He’s made his position clear. Now, where’s the video with Biden denouncing the hate shown by BLM and the city-to-city rioting?
We watched the debate. Biden did begin the interruption process with the first question. Wallace didn't comment until Trump began interrupting. Read the transcript.
My guess-electors in states carried by Republicans could vote in EC for whoever RNC designated. If Biden wins enough states to get to 270 it wouldn’t matter.

so funny cause he was just clowning biden for constantly wearing his mask 😂😂

jus talking shit bout Biden always having a mask on n now look at ya ..INFECTED
joe biden better not fuckinf get it
But he said it’s a hoax and makes wearing a mask a joke. He bashed Biden for wearing a mask. Like momma said “a hard head causes a hard ass”
We in the Stevens flock pray for your speedy recoveries, and congratulations on beating Joe Biden's next play for skipping the debates. No excuses left for Joe, not even Covid19!

Great excuse to not have to do a second debate where he won't be able to yell over Biden's answer/rebuttal
While an administrative discharge is less serious than a court martial; the repercussions can still have consequences concerning employment, veterans benefits and social standing. It allows the Navy, in Biden’s case, to “fire” someone who does not represent good character.
Pissed if he gave it to Biden or anyone else who had the misfortune of being around him.
There, I hope your happy!  Meanwhile, Antifa is burning down our cities, assaulting citizens and our police, rioting &amp; looting. Biden said Antifa was “just an idea” and not organized,but he gets a pass.

Come on #chriswallace....are you serious? You softballed biden 95% of the and stood in Trump's face over white supremacists. When buden said, "No! I won't answer the question!" Why didn't you press him on packing the court????
And Biden says voter fraud isn't happening.
Love your honest reporting but Fox News and some of your fellow anchors have sold we conservatives out. Chris Wallace was totally bias against the President and covering for Biden he let it be known last night that he’s very liberal left in that joke of a debate
No way would I ever vote for Biden. Vote for Harris???? I think my grandma shit her out in the outhouse.
I love Fox news but very disappointed in Chris Wallace behavior during the debate he was disrespectful to President Trump never letting him finish  but allowing Joe Biden to say anything true or false I truly felt like I was watching President Trump debate both Wallace &amp; Biden
The FBI said it was an idea not an organization! So point Biden for listening to our FBI
I liked when Biden told trump, no green deal, then was beginning to tell Wallace how good the green deal was, Wallace helped him recover, and get back on track
It's kind of a variation on "But-What-About-Abortion!" Push pedo conspiracy theories, and at the center of it all is HRC, Biden, etc, and Trump is a white knight fighting a secret war against them to save the kids. In other words, a trumped-up reason never to vote for Democrats.

I can hear the howls of censorship from the #Trumplican #cult when they shut down  from interrupting &amp; shouting over Biden when it's not his time to speak.
I thought Greg “short” explanation reading transcript of debate was enough to clear up what was meant by stand down stand by. It was a response to Biden saying “Proud Boys” &amp; repeating Chris Wallace request time say “stand down stand by”.

As excited as I am about Biden’s lead I’m extremely disappointed that 41%  of people still support this repugnant person.
Why hasn’t Chris Wallace done his fair &amp; balance duty? Why did he ask a question answered multiple times over the past 4 years by POTUS Trump &amp; surrogates like Hershal Walker? Why didn’t he challenge Joe Biden about Antifa or BLM violence at all? Will  get answers?
And Biden is friends with members of the KKK and didn’t denounce Antifa or BLM for all there destruction to black people. SO COME ON MAN
If they close down POTUS’s microphone when he counters back, it should be MANDATORY for them to scan Biden for wires 😡
Ask Biden to denounce Antifa with the same tenacity.  Trump has condemned about a hundred times over 4 years and you keep bringing it back. So we don’t care if you’re tired of it.
Why do liberals do this? Why lie to yourselves? You see Trump shows up on 24 hours notice and attracts 25k-35k and Biden couldn’t draw 2k before the pandemic.
PROOF BIDEN DID NOT WEAR A WIRE! LOL!
He is just doing what Chris Wallace did which is distract from the real problem, Joe Biden. Another deep state, Soros goon exposed by Trump.

Trump, dominated the debate, like it or not, Biden showed a weakness that comes with age, like it or not. They should let the other candidates on the debate stage, these two will also deliver an unpleasant presidency
WTG Joe!!!
This is important.
I've been listening to Biden promise 'everything' since my twenties. It is frankly amazing that he is the Democratic candidate for president. He is the #Swamp and represents the worse of politicians. Perfect evidence that we need #TermLimits
Maggie, brilliant observation! You should have reported about instead you chose to suck-up to him and Ivanka. Hope supporting a racist family and a Fascist was worth it. Softball #TrumpIsATraitor reporting and Joe Biden attacks is your style.
Truth.
BREAKING: Biden to moderate next presidential debate. Vows not to provide himself the questions beforehand.
I took my kids away from the TV, but that's because I didn't want you smelling them!!  Biden calls first debate 'embarrassing for the country,' wonders how many people took 'kids away from the television'
Yes Biden being all wired up and calling names was an embarrassment
“What I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face.” -Joe Biden   This was his answer to what does reimagining policing mean and do you support the black lives matter call for community control of policing.
Trump went low and Biden went high. You bet I’d defend my son, and Biden had the good taste not to bring up Trumps children, and God only knows what could be said there.
This idiot doesn’t remember the debate he was in. Biden had no problem speaking to Law and Order.
Trump was the name calling buffoon. Biden spoke of actual policy where trump did but spout his usual rhetoric and whined like a petulant toddler.
biden’s laugh rly got me... he said “you dumb mother fucker” in just a couple of chuckles.
The media and Biden’s party has attacked Trump and his family relentlessly the past four years. But when one of your gets the same treatment you go soft?
spent a lot of time dogging out Biden, but has yet to say anything positive about Trump in the debate.

Many across the world looked on as the first debate between President Trump and Joe Biden devolved into a verbal slugfest.
I just found out my friend, a lifetime Republican who voted Trump in 2016, is voting Biden/Harris. Trump’s behavior at the debate was the deciding factor!!
You mean Biden gotcha thanks for clarifying that.
Just because she’s a never Trumper doesn’t mean anything because she still is able to see the flaws in Biden and understand the base of Trump and communicate that and honestly I don’t find that  fair because many are Trumpers no matter what so at least she’s speaking logic truth!
Chris is Riding On Biden 😂🤣

You’re both terrible leaders, and Biden can’t lose what he already didn’t have.  I watched the debate and I felt like the median between two immature arguing teenagers trying to one up and blame each other over the pettiest of things.
“When Byrd died, Biden was far from the only one to “praise” him.  The NAACP’s then-president said in a statement, which acknowledged the senator’s former KKK ties, that “Senator Byrd reflects the transformative power of this nation.”
Biden is an embarrassment.
From the way I seen it,he was talking about Biden wanted to use the Logan Act trying to get General Flynn and basically they had fear in their heads because undoubtably Gen Flynn has the goods on the kokk loving demoRats and it’s set in concrete
Telling a sitting president to shut up, calling him a clown and a fool is beneath VP Biden. I don’t believe either Senator Sanders or Secretary Clinton would have been compelled to use that language. Nevertheless, I support Biden without reservation.

I did notice that Biden’s mic was turned up louder. He was blaring.
Biden also wore a wire, no doubt in our minds. Dems cheat &amp; lie so much.
Yeah that was Trump vs Wallace/Biden and still won against Wallace with Biden practically on the sidelines.
And he damn sure IS NOT VICE PRESIDENT like Wallace kept calling him. PENCE IS VICE PRESIDENT and BIDEN IS 'FORMER' VP O'BIDEN!!
Also, Wallace kept cutting PresTrump off &amp; became a Dem rebuttal himself to for Biden. He also let Biden interrupt &amp; gave him more time to refute &amp; more time to answer. Chris Wallace was complete sham😡#MAGA2020
Ms. McEnany, please help make this clear bc I wanted to punch something every time Wallace said to Biden, 'Mr. Vice President...' HE IS NOT VICE PRESIDENT. PENCE IS! BIDEN IS 'FORMER' VP O'BIDEN!!!
Nah i don't we need to vote Democrat. I think they need to present us with better options. Biden and Trump on the same level for me
Trump and Biden need to 1v1 here to decide who is our president
I said many times now, BIDEN IS NOT VP! HE IS 'FORMER' VP O'BIDEN!!! I wanted to punch something every time leftie Wallace called Biden, Mr. Vice President. We all know Trump was 2 armed. Not a good debate and absolutely not fair.
BIDEN IS NOT VP! HE IS 'FORMER' VP O'BIDEN! Wallace is on the left making the whole debate Biden-sided. They could have had better and better questions! Other than feeling Trump won, it really was a wasted 90 mins! Too many left lies too.

And w/ Biden throttling a reopen, how many more would we lose?  If the economy wasn't as strong as it was, where would we be now. How would increasing regulations &amp; taxes on business stimulate growth? Biden can't invent enough green jobs even if you believe him. #Biden=#Recession
Trump was debating Wallace: “Will you denounce the white supremacists in Kenosha?” That group was Antifa and BLM? You know it and haven’t said a thing. Why didn’t he ask Biden to denounce those group? Trump denounces white supremacy and KKK every press conference practically!

About a year after Beau Biden died, Hunter started dating his widow, Hallie. Rather than judging them harshly or worrying about how scandalous this could be,  expressed his full support and said he just wanted them both to be happy. #nojudgmentjoe
After decompressing from last nights debate. I’m voting for Joe Biden. There’s no way in hell I’m going to let Donald Trump be the face of this country for the next 4 years. No chance in hell.
Biden is as much a political hatchet man as anyone in office.

Hunter Biden's activities are far from debunked. This is an extremely detailed accounting with supporting documentation &amp; interviews.  This is the kind of evidence that the Dems WANTED to find on  Is there a rug big enough? We'll see.
I understand, but why don't you explain why a site that was a source for ANTIFA now redirects to Joe Biden. Somebody connected had to think this was beneficial. They took down the original site now they are being investigated. You are obfuscating.
Out admin said she couldn’t vote Biden (whose a better Republican than trump ever will be) because he’s a Democrat and will be taking orders from Hillary.
I gotta vote for bernie if i do vote. you can obviously tell biden nor trump is for the people, especially the black community.

I originally thought he said "in July" which didn't make any sense. I glad to see that Biden is actually just a lot more cultured than me.
Biden’s gonna lock us all down again... just like his party’s governors!!
Obviously Biden is old and wimpy,, no better year to vote third party as the two party  system has failed
Biden didn’t wear a wire but Trump did. You could tell that he was listening to someone
This was on FULL display throughout  last night’s debate. Trump was belligerently defensive, condescending and callous when he was critiqued either by Biden or Chris Wallace.
Hey Trump... Biden doesn’t have big rallies because he actually CARES about Americans, not because no one shows.   WE CARE about America &amp; our fellow Americans. We. Want. Better.   Build. Back. Better.
"Joe Biden did not wear a wire to aid him in the debate, Lead Stories and PolitiFact confirm"
Watching Biden speak on FOX News. He’s rambling on as usual. Sad. Think he had an earpiece to keep him on task at the debate- oh and he had Wallace to help.
A little unsolicited advice for Joe Biden... DON’T GET SUCKED INTO HIS CHILDISH BEHAVIOR.   As hard as it is to hear, if you let the petulant child speak, he is his own worst enemy.
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary said terms like white supremacist, antifa, fascism and racism were all trending after the debate.  Here's what else Americans were looking up after President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden took the stage.

Joe Biden did not wear a wire. To prove it, he agreed to be checked for wires before the debate.  He backed out of the agreement before the debate.  So he had no wire or they'd have found it, when they didn't check like they were originally going to.  Proof. Not #BidenWired

Trump set the house on fire. Biden tried to put out the fire but could have done a better job. Blaming them equally for the house burning down makes no sense.

President Trump had to debate Wallace and Biden. And by the way Biden did not have any good points. Every time the president tried to refute Biden‘s lies, Wallace would cut him off and say sir you’ve had your time. What a bunch of BS

4 takeaways from the first debate between President Trump and Joe Biden
Biden smoked Trump’s ass in the debate last night. We, the People, have had enough!!!
Biden said the Moscow Payments were "debunked?" How did someone debunk this? Do you know the fact checking organization that debunks US Homeland Security? It's called IDBISID which stands for "It's Debunked Because I Say It's Debunked" #IDBISID
Biden wore a wire...this explains a lot.         #FoxFakeNews
Let Trump talk until he actually sounds so stupid, Biden would have all 538 electoral college votes.
The Biden campaign broke its single-hour fundraising record during the debate, raising $3.8 million between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., the campaign says.
I love that Biden didn’t dance around it. He was honest.  I’m glad y’all will be working TOGETHER for the best solution.
America is literally dying under Trump. Of course Biden is better.
I believe Biden had some sort of listening device. He kept jotting notes.....then read them. Someone feeding him info.
I get sick of Biden bringing up his family tragedies.  Feels dirty after the 10,000 time.  Lip quiver and everything.

I wouldn't be caught dead with a Biden sign!!
I’ll say it: Wallace expressed obvious bias, Trump was childishly belligerent, and Biden still wasn’t capable of much independent thought. #GodHelpUsAll
Agreed there!  If I was Biden, I’d demand a shock collar for the tweeter in chief.
You're simply suffering that dreaded TDS.  Trump moved immediately to ban China travel, while Biden called him Xenophobic!  Please do your homework.  Trump saved lives!
I think if Fox had a true moderator last night, things might have gone better. Chris Wallace was battling Trump. Was gentle with Biden. Trump was debating two people last night, not one. Will never again watch Chris Wallace.
Was Biden President for 47 years? Wow. I had no idea. I thought he was just a Congressman with a single vote and a VP with no vote, but hey, you’re the expert. #GOPComplicitTraitors
Hey could Biden have used the word xenophobic because Trump called it the “Chinese Virus”?  Just a thought.
Joe Biden is running for President.  He should be able to handle the pressure.  If he can't, there's no use in him running.   Last night showed he is weak.   I could care less about his "feels".
Well let’s see, where did Biden get that from? Did he make it up? Nooooo....he didn’t did he?
TRUMP!!!  EVEN THOUGH HE INTERRUPTED numerous times.  Biden was ridiculous, obviously, unprepared.
What the hell you talking about?  Where is Hunter Biden?  #Trump2020 #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
At this point it’s perfectly clear. If you support Donald Trump, you support white supremacy. #shutupman #Clown #Biden
Perfect, this shows just how STUPID these people are!  Let me guess, they are voting for Biden.  Dumb and Dumber!!
Trump said last night “He’s wrong” when Biden pointed this very thing out. Trump knows more about national security threats than his own FBI Director, apparently.
I just feel like you could replace either one of the candidates with John Addams in the scene...  President Donald Trump... good luck  President Joe Biden... good luck   😅
Every psychologist in America freaked out when Joe Biden said police should call psychologist whenever people are not cooperating instead of using force... Just imagine being a psychologist and having to pull up to an active crime scene that is extremely dangerous. Biden202 😂😂
We can never apologize enough, but I am sorry. I am voting for Biden.
Biden absolutely got demolished last night. Couldnt provide any numbers or facts to what he said, dodged every question, and could only respond with "will you just shut up man😤" 😂
I agree. Trump did nothing to reverse the trajectory of the race, and he was so belligerent that even when Biden lost his cool he came off as being more likeable. After all, what American watching last night didn't want to tell Trump to STFU?
Trump is frustrating af but I won’t say Biden is scared 😂
VOTE RED 🟥 2020 Biden = Globalism/Communism  Trump = America/Freedom 😎
Did Chris Wallace replace Biden as the Democrat nominee?
I don’t think there are many people out there that care about Hunter Biden.  I don’t understand the President’s fixation.  Hunter Biden isn’t running for President.
This moment stood out to me. Biden talking about his dead son and Trump interrupting him to insult his living son who is a recovering drug addict. Trump is a moral monster.
Why did #ChrisWallace give Biden the answers? It’s clear he did because Biden would look down and read the answer off. Wallace would cut Trumps time but give Biden the full 2 mins. Done with Fox and Wallace.
He proved us right. He’s a liar and a cheat. He did give Biden the questions in advance. Otherwise after the 2nd question was asked Biden wouldn’t have looked down and started reading from his notes.

Debate Takeaways: Stark differences between Trump, Biden
Given the circumstances in tonight's hellacious debate, Biden did better than Trump. I'm hoping Biden can improve on the next 2 debates in regards to him not letting Trump's antics get him off base. Trump badly needs a teleprompter and his aides to help him not get too hot.
I don’t fw Biden. Trump is just dumb as fuck lmao
And Trump wouldn’t shut up for Biden to hang himself! They all 3 sucked but the activist pundits and press on both sides will spin it as a win! So what
It was a 2 on 1 debate Wallace kept interrupting Trump while carrying Biden's water. #Trump2020 #4moreyears #votered #backtheblue
Y'all are gonna have to except your dear leader, like Biden said isn't smart enuf to debate the facts. We're gonna have to start a trump rehab for you people. Country before party. Period.
Biden is China.😬
If you debate in high school, &amp; it is my turn to speak, the opposition is not allowed to talk until I’m done. I’m baffled people are taking Trump not letting Biden speak, interrupting him constantly, &amp; moderator asking him to stop as “he’s biased” is so ridiculous.
Please some of you big accounts, look at the last few minutes post debate. Biden is with Chris Wallace, a female aid goes to Bidens podium and removes a tablet, Biden was reading from real-time. You can see him reading and speaking, especially when quoting numbers
Lmao biden not winning

I choose to believe Joe Biden has dementia. I also believe it's pitiful the way his own family and political party are using him.
Wallace Lost; the President who should have “some” latitude was continually cut off in mid sentence; fair and balanced my butt; Biden had the answers, obviously; Biden reading the questions while the question was asked;  rewind it, so obvious!
Sorry, I was being sarcastic  Biden would not gain from actually helping people, only the people he claim to care about
Biden is done debating. This was a one time deal.

Donald Trump is a blood and guts sucking agitator. Joe Biden is an inspired, bold, just (servant of the American people)
Ari, Wallace didn’t allow the President to rebuke Biden’s idiotic thoughts; he was very effective and then Wallace would cut him off!! Wallace D-
What is bizarre? The first sentence is almost undeniable. The second tracks the facts very, very closely, if you pay attention to the facts. See Politico's "Biden Inc" story. Politico leans LEFT, but they told it straight.
I want us to all see Joe, Jill, and Hunter Biden 's tax returns.
I'm anti-Trump and anti-Biden. Or, rather, I'm for certain principles, and hole all sides to those principles equally. I have praised both Trump and Biden for various things, but blasted both of them a whole lot more. With either as president, the nation loses.
I thought at one point Chris Wallace would pause and go spoon feed Joe Biden his nursing home pudding. #ChrisWallaceSucks
How five members of Joe Biden’s family got rich through his connections
Absolutely! His body language with Biden made it obvious.
All Biden did was repeat liberal media talking points - he did not ask a single question that he actual thought of . Nor did he discuss anything he would do , he only critiqued the president ..
😆😆🤣CNN show of hands.  (The three behind her didn’t raise their hand for Biden😉)
Biden's refusal 2 take a stand on the question of court packing is pure, unadulterated cowardice. Unacceptable. And his long, long softness toward China, combined with Hunter's multiple business deals w/China, are a serious concern, almost as serious as Trump's kowtowing 2 Putin.
I have no idea to whom you are speaking. Neither Andy nor I is committed to voting for Biden. I sure as hell am not voting for him.
and that Biden believes Antifa is an idea
The Midwest just leaned towards Trump. 1. Lockdowns  2. Jobs 3. Law and Order  Biden can’t win on these.

He literally attacked Trump more than Biden. It will go down as the worst moment of his career.

The point is he was discharged from service, that Biden refuted, then received LOTS of money for his board seat at Burisma, which Biden also refuted.
biden telling trump to shut up was amazing thank u
Trump beat Biden and Wallace!
The point is to get that fucking clown out of office? Do I think Biden is a great candidate? HELL NO but he’s a fuck ton of a lot better than whatever the hell is in there now
Joe Biden is Carole baskin
It was as if Chris Wallace and Biden practiced together ahead of time.
"Shut up, man." = Shut up, ignorant idiot --
I'm glad Biden called out all the dog whistles, but it's very apparent Nov 3 is going to be violent and the aftermath may be worse.
Joe Biden is receiving answers through his Esteem hearing implant. He touches his pocket to activate it and looks down because he needs to concentrate on what he is being told through it.If you watch him closely you can see it every time.
When Biden called him a clown I almost lost it 😂
The first debate between President  and Joe Biden is over. Who do you think won?  #Debates2020  #alpolitics
Did Biden miss opportunities to challenge the President? Yes. But Chris Wallace did a decent job of checking the President so that Biden didn’t have to. I think overall Biden will get a boost in the polls from women and independent voters just from the president’s attitude.
True. Biden won by standing there and saying nothing.  did more damage to himself than Biden ever could!
I had already decided that I was voting for Biden but having to face time my family so that they could say goodbye to their dying father/husband made my passion to get trump out even stronger.
Biggest thing I got. Biden says all the stuff about Hunter and Jim Biden is debunked. Well Trumps collusion has been debunked why haven’t they let that go.
After det debate I’ll take Biden cause either way they both a racist
Donald Trump wasn't give a chance to denounce white supremacist bc Joe Biden and Chris Wallace interrupted him and then Chris changed the topic. So how was he going to be able to. I haven't seen jim crow Joe denounce antifa or any Democrat for that matter.
Joe Biden should have walked onto that stage, disregarded every question posed to him and used each of his 2 minute segments to point out 1). Trump lies, 2). Trump's incompetence, 3). $750 federal tax payment and 4). 5 things his administration plans to do and then walked TF off!
Okay, maybe I don't.  What I do understand is how two messages directly contradict each other.  Biden stumbled hard on this one. All he had to do was discuss his efforts with AOC/his task force.  But he didn't.
Bully Trump. Constantly going after Biden about stupid stuff, had nothing 2 do with the questions. Asked him "would condemn the White Supremacists &amp; KKK". He refused, he ignored the question, but said,"I urge my followers 2 show up  polls &amp; stand by".That is scary!
everyone knows trumps position and as for biden's position it's whatever his handlers want it to be and that's why trump was so hard hitting on biden and why biden kept fumbling on his talking points and why the moderator had to constantly step in and cover for his ass
Who cares!!?? Did Biden’s taxes mention his corruption with son, Hunter!?!  #BidenCorruption #BidenCrimeFamily #Trump2020 #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica #TrumpLandslide2020 #Trump2020LandslideVictory
You mean the Trump vs Wallace and Biden?
Maybe I’m cynical but I feel like that performance rallies Trump’s base and didn’t make anyone want to vote for Biden. So I would say it’s a “win” for Trump. But what do I know?
Biden is a patriot
Wallace was Not impartial. It was Trump arguing with Biden and Wallace. Poor moderator. Overall I’d say Trump. But it wasn’t really a debate at all. Sad to see.
Damn right he is, and did anyone else see Biden funky go get a tablet off his podium post debate. Looked like he was reading a lot
This didn't help Trump. I don't think it helped Biden much...No one who had their mind made up changed it based on that...but I'm pretty damn sure Trump didn't bring anyone new into the tent, and I don't think he turned anyone off voting Biden.
Dear Mr. Biden, please DO NOT concede on Election Day or Election Night, November 3, 2020 until ALL of the votes in USA are counted!Trump starts getting half a million likes, and Biden pumps out his bots. Look at these profiles 😂
To the asshole who stole the Biden/Harris Sticker and Doug Jones Magnet off my car,  First of all, FUCK YOU. Secondly, I will now be making donations to both campaigns so jokes on you:
If you support Biden, you don’t care about black lives either.
Trump would've doubled the negative ads because he has No positive ads. Joe Biden cares.
Let's Not forget the millions who've lost access to health care.  Also don't forget that Trump is Actively in court now trying to take away Obamacare from millions more.  And Trump STILL doesn't have a health care plan. Joe Biden has already done the plan. Vote Biden
It's time to get some adults back in the White House.  Vote Biden
Biden appealing to dog lovers with a recent ad.
I think there is a difference between wishing him harm (which is what I’d suspect he would do if Biden were sick) and feeling bad for him. I don’t think we should wish him harm, but I am not going to feel bad when he got it do to his own negligence and has consciously spread it
And where did this Doogie Housier get his degree.  One of Trump's many Suck Ups Still trying to convince Americans to Drink the Kool-aid. Who does Americans trust.? We will vote Biden.
Where are these ppl that are going to vote for Biden? They def don't show up at events anywhere. Not big numbers on his Twitter.  I mean...you are clearly delusional. You know how numbers work, correct? 27.1 m views... Biden and Harris couldn't do that in a month.  One (1) tweet
Can you tell me if Biden who used the N-word, voting against busing: Per chameleon, friend to KKK Grand Dragon, passed oppressive prison law, has he been asked about repudiating this? Who has been the true racist?
I would not be surprised if Pres. Trump knew he was positive for Covid 19 at the debate and that he hoped that he, or someone with him, would give VP Biden Covid 19 also.
I agree with everything except the first one. 😂 And I don't even like Biden, but yes, I'd love to see Cheeto's face.
Thankfully Biden tested negative.
The difference in leadership is very clear.  I like presidents who don't get the virus vote Biden for real leadership.
Christmas came early.  Trump's leadership during this covid crisis is the reason Americans will vote Joe Biden in a BLUE landslide.
Trump should enjoy his hospital stay,  unlike the millions of people who don't have health insurance.  Americans are voting to give you a nice long sick leave. We like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden
Joe Biden is an example of what a real president Should be.  The choice is so clear about who is Best to lead our country. I like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden.
Time for Trump to take a Permanent Sick Leave.  Americans need a real leader.  Not a game show host. America needs Joe Biden, a leader who cares.
His health problems have underscored the reasons why he was such a poor choice for America.  This is what happens when you elect a game show host to run the most powerful country in the world.  Americans will now repeat those words "Your Fired". Time for Experience.  Vote Biden
I don't know who's running the country but I Do Know who Shouldn't be.  NOT Trump.  He couldn't even protect himself from the virus and he definitely has Not protected America.  I like presidents who don't get the virus.  Voting Biden
Isn’t it weird how mean hostile press people closest 2Trump got sick with covid beforeTrump? Were they sprayed with the covid?Its just weird how it’s Republicans that are positive&amp; Pelosi scurries away&amp;now Biden&amp;Obama are being so nice &amp;magnanimous?It’s really weird&amp;I Pray4 Trump
Joe Biden is nothing more than a MEAT PUPPET for the new, radical left -
RUSH: They like Biden, they say; they don't like Trump. But then when you ask 'em, "Well, who's gonna win?" by 56 to 40, they think Trump.
I’m praying right now for your dad. Wishing you and your family peace and good health, Falesha. Vote. Fight. Biden.
Biden attacks him about his handling of covid and his full staff could be in the ICU tomorrow . Biden needs to back off and see if he will need treatment soon.
Because Biden’s team could have an outbreak tomorrow . The virus doesn’t give a damn about politics .
Trump would have said Biden died in his basement .
Trump just a few days ago mocked Biden wearing a mask .
The “cages” were built by the Obama/Biden administration...strange how there was no public outrage about “kids in cages” ‘til Trump became POTUS. What’s a better idea to keep 1,000’s of unexpected unaccompanied minors safe?
That’s an assumption. We truly don’t know what he would do and to say otherwise just shows bias. Biden did the right thing.

Trump promised an October Surprise.  So SURPRISE! Can't wait to see the November Surprise that Joe Biden has in mind.  Voting Biden
I could see this going one of two ways: people don’t really care about Pence the way they do Trump/don’t have confidence in him, so Biden wins. Or people feel a ton of sympathy and vote Pence.
We Must also hold Trump accountable for continuing to ignore CDC guidelines.  And we Will hold him accountable this November.  Voting Biden
Let's All stay Angry together and #VoteHimOut. I've lost count of all the many ways Trump and his family have destroyed our country.  Voting Biden.

Why don’t you worry about yours? I’m a great father. Why don’t you ask yours not to vote for Biden? I’d hate  for them to live with socialism.
They should all resign (include Trump) for not alerting the Biden campaign.
I think you are underestimating the apathy of ALL moderates toward Biden, regardless of how they feel about Trump.
Maybe so. But don’t kid yourself, you’d vote for Biden under the same conditions.
Biden lies all over the stage in the debate, but that’s fine right?
Hate to break it to you (or myself) but Biden is about to lose the most lopsided election in modern history.  Trying to beat a racist with a racist and a VP who has spent her career oppressing her own race is never gonna work.
Imagine what it wouldv'e been if he would've kept the boarders opened like The Dumb Dems &amp; Biden wanted what 2.5 Million maybe ?? Think before you post your shit for brains is showing
For those arguing that Biden has done nothing in 47 years, he's a list of sponsored bills just from 2007-2009.
We also pray for the Biden family health and safety.   And yes... I am a Trump supporter.
🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ “I don’t wear face masks like him... every time you see [Biden], he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away... and he still shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen” -
Agree, the better future begins with Joe Biden being elected president and the Trump Confederacy of Dunces leaving DC for good.
Thank God.  Voting Biden
BREAKING: Joe and Jill Biden have tested NEGATIVE for the coronavirus, per wire reports.
thank you mr. vice president biden for encouraging people to be empathetic even if you hate trump. idc if this tweet is just a political stunt, at least he can humble himself enough to recognize it peacefully
Be well Mr Biden .
Not unless we all lose the use of our brains.  I like Presidents who don't get the Virus.  Vote Biden.
Vice President Biden was just tested for Covid-19 and is now awaiting his results, per the wire.
Joe Biden must continue to get the message out. We Only have days until the election.  We want Biden to win by a landslide.  It's Trump's own fault that he got the virus that he's downplayed since February. #VoteHimOut
Democrats too nice if Biden was sick, 45 would clown him for precautions he had taken.
Joe Biden to be tested for COVID after President Donald Trump reports positive result
As long as he isn't Dead. We VOTE.  We Desperately need Biden.
Biden is now a putin puppet
Because Trump's a very Selfish human being.  He only cares about his own needs. His refusal to Wear Masks and No Social Distancing. Voting Biden. The man with a plan.
“Trump got it and beat it” is the spin now ? Not trump recklessly hardly ever wore a mask and mocked Biden for wearing one ?
Well Biden does that to all the girls/women. No matter the age. Sometimes he throws in a sniff.
Maybe you just saw this notice too—assume they’ll redo testing in the coming day(s) as well, to confirm. So fingers crossed for Biden..., let alone all the others who unknowingly were in a risky position.
Wow! If only there was something that could have prevented Trump from catching the virus.  Oh, there was.  CDC Recommended Wearing MASKS,  and Social Distancing. Maybe Joe Biden was right for Wearing his Mask.
No I don't believe you understood. You just want to deny it. Biden is a do-nothing politician that's had a lot of practice.
Every democratic nominee. Joe Biden, Obama, Kerry, Clinton. What are you even talking about?
Trump tested positive for COVID &amp; he was at the debate clowning Biden for wearing a mask... see God don’t like ugly. I have to laugh
Everyone is stuck on Trump saying “sure” to a question he’s been asked hundreds of times. Why aren’t we wondering why Biden wouldn’t answer questions about packing the court or eliminating the filibuster?? We’re asking the wrong questions people.
Yes, but if it’s true, it’s the worst timing bc he could have given it to Biden. And what happens if either or both are hospitalized with vent or worse before 11/3 or after before votes are counted?
He never called it a hoax!!
He never called the virus a hoax...and it has indeed been used to expand gov’t power (literally shutting down our economy, schools, sports, churches, all recreational activities) &amp; isolating old/sick people from their families since March!
Even  calls Biden’s accusation that Trump called it a hoax “misleading”.
Biden’s not acting President until Trump invokes the 25th... which would probably depend on his symptoms. That being said if he’s asymptotic I think it’s capable for him to act as POTUS from quarantine via webcam considering that’s how most of the country works now
WAIT WHAT THE FUCK I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE JOKING  Ohhh noooo well it looks like he can't be president! That's just so very unfortunate! Well looks like Joe Biden wins, right? Heheh #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCovid

Not becoming a Biden Guy here but you have to admit the whistlestop tour whips
Now do Biden, the Dems... waiting...
That’s fair, I really don’t know. I think we can all agree that, at the very least, for decades he’s been using the system to his advantage. During those same decades, Biden was helping craft that exact system.
Vote Biden for a real president not some clown who plays one on TV. Biden actually pays his taxes and supports the military.  As a  military mom, this is what's important to me.
#BreakingNews The #Biden campaign already called a lid for tomorrow. He’s tired
Any way someone could post some solid material referencing their conduct and actual crimes?  I looked and couldn't come up with any.  I've heard some but just not sure it's fact or talk.  Biden called Antifa an idea?.. Ideas don't take over cities and burn shit down.
Or lack of action, all 47 years in Biden's case.
Watch Brenden Dilley's broadcast: Debate Hangover, Biden Exposed and More! W/ Author Brenden Dilley #TheDilleyShow
Did you not hear Biden say that he was raising taxes? Ending the tax breaks families got under Trump.
Left will not convince 2/3 of Senate to ditch filibuster. No seats stolen just because it didn't go your way. Trump is correct, he's president for a 4 year term, not 3.5. Could be 8 years if more republicans get out and vote. No way Biden gets more people to vote than Clinton.
And that's why Biden and his associates are the ones suggesting they should try to overturn an election result if they suspect it "might" be fraudulent, and actively trying to sabotage the postal service so that mail-in ballots don't arrive on time  Oh wait...

Mayor Pete and I’m excited to vote for Biden now.
Biden raised over $700 million in two months.  Trump is hemorrhaging money.  Yes, Citizens United should be overturned, but the broader point here is that trying to tap your resources too early will hurt down the road.    Well, that and lighting the money on fire like Trump did.
Iowa is going Democrat.  Vote Biden
You are so wrong. 47 years in politics. VP for 8 years. Why are y'all so optimistic about Biden. I understand the Trump hate but cannot grasp why Biden is the answer. The dude is a typical politician. They care not for us peons.
I wonder how much more 💰 the Democrats will raise after the next debate? Trump has really been great for our fundraising.  Vote Biden
And yet Trump doesn't care.  As long as he can get anyone to show up for the Trump Show, he's happy.  He doesn't care about the millions who've caught the virus or the  200,000 who have died. Time for a change.  Biden cares about all of us.  Vote Biden.
Biden needs to insist on change.  If Trump doesn't agree,  let him stay home and tweet.  Joe Biden is the best man for the job.  If we all vote,  Biden will win by a landslide but he can't win without us doing our part.
Among other benefits, it will be very nice not to have to sit through another Kayleigh McEnany press briefing after Joe Biden takes office on January 20, 2021.

All taken out of context. How about Biden voting for segregation and against busing: Cameleon said that. he eulogized a grand dragon of the KKK.. do I need to on? . tit-for-tat,,, right
Just press the Biden/Harris the same and we would see that they are fair... They ask them and let them answer without aggressive follow up and challenge. Joe's racist voting past is never asked about.

You don’t know the first thing about either of Dr. Biden’s marriages. I can’t believe you were ever a professional. She earned her doctorate thru years of work, work put on the back burner because she chose to first raise her three kids. You denigrate other women, how sad.

Biden is rapidly gaining ground.
Biden was saying the same thing that we were all yelling at our TV sets. It felt Sooo Good!
Come listen to the #Truth from my brother  on #Spreaker #UnleashedNation
Trump keeps saying Biden can’t or won’t say the words “law and order” when in fact he did say those words at the debate, he said “Law and order with justice.” Just, you know, throw it on the pile
I’m sure Biden’s plan was plagiarized
The Trump campaign guy who’s on record as anti-Joe Biden-visiting-his-dead-son’s-grave is... now mad at Biden for being interrupted by a loud moving train?
It was insulting to see the so called narrator continually interrupt President Trump and not Biden! The entire world respects our President and we are letting these newscasters treat him with such disrespect
Biden doesn't like any of those things either though

They are waiting can't indict him until he is no longer president!! Joe Biden brought the economy back from one of the worst recessions in history. His plan of record will bring many many jobs to America and reinvigorate our economy. You can actually read his plan on his website.
in his administration that Antifa is leading, organizing and funding acts of violence in cities across the country from a national level. It is not Joe Biden's job to call governors, curious why that is brought up and the correlation. But, yes, Joe Biden is a democrat
Response to Perry Hooper, Jr First, Joe Biden has denounced violence and riots. He has done this time and again. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau views Antifa as "more of an ideology than an organization,"undercutting statements by President Donald Trump and others
In response to Barry Moore  Joe Biden has never dodged, evaded or refused to answer questions unless he had a reason. Biden was very specific about his plans, trump was not. Trump's tax cut for the upper echelon have done nothing but increase our deficit
You heard him. Sometimes silence is your answer. Joe Biden did not support the Green New Deal. AOC and Biden have gotten together to work on a new plan that will be a compromise. The courts have ruled against the Trump administration and campaign numerous times recently
of blatant disregard for human decency. The time for rapid testing was 6-8 months ago. Joe Biden has his own plan. No president has provided a supreme court justice list. This is a made up thing. Would you like him to list unicorn names too? I think he did address the question.
the proposed cuts can total more than $400 million depending on how you do the math.Part of Biden's criminal justice plan includes a renewed investment in community policing initiatives including COPS also,by not signing the HEROS ACT already passed by the House of Representative
Obamacare in the supreme court. Americans want healthcare.This is a fact.Healthy people are able to work &amp; are happy this produces a stronger economy &amp; a better physical and fiscal nation. No down side.Joe Biden said he wants to open up our country safely.Joe Biden never,I repeat

Response to Perry Hooper, Jr First, Joe Biden has denounced violence and riots. He has done this time and again. FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau views Antifa as "more of an ideology than an organization,"undercutting statements by President Donald Trump and others
In response to Barry Moore  Joe Biden has never dodged, evaded or refused to answer questions unless he had a reason. Biden was very specific about his plans, trump was not. Trump's tax cut for the upper echelon have done nothing but increase our deficit
You heard him. Sometimes silence is your answer. Joe Biden did not support the Green New Deal. AOC and Biden have gotten together to work on a new plan that will be a compromise. The courts have ruled against the Trump administration and campaign numerous times recently
of blatant disregard for human decency. The time for rapid testing was 6-8 months ago. Joe Biden has his own plan. No president has provided a supreme court justice list. This is a made up thing. Would you like him to list unicorn names too? I think he did address the question.
the proposed cuts can total more than $400 million depending on how you do the math.Part of Biden's criminal justice plan includes a renewed investment in community policing initiatives including COPS also,by not signing the HEROS ACT already passed by the House of Representative
Obamacare in the supreme court. Americans want healthcare.This is a fact.Healthy people are able to work &amp; are happy this produces a stronger economy &amp; a better physical and fiscal nation. No down side.Joe Biden said he wants to open up our country safely.Joe Biden never,I repeat
They going after Trumps finances instead of Goong after the lying criminal Comey sitting in front of them What about the 3 million Biden got from Putin’s wife Hello You guys are evil Vengeance is mine saith the Lord I ask vengeance by God on you liars
K so just vote biden
Drug addiction is a crisis in America, but last night president Trump decided to make that the punchline of one of his jabs to Biden. I’ve never witnessed a less presidential president.
Biden is *literally* the middle. What the fuck is this?
&amp; then Joe Biden did so well yesterday that people assumed he was wearing a wire

What I saw last night was a orange face orangutan having a fit because he got caught in a lot of lies! Beside Joe Biden is going to be our next president and trump knows it! January 30th jail time for the trumps!
I thought I was blocked ??? Biden lost all the radicals last night
Trump said that Biden couldn’t even mention Law Enforcement because he would lose support from his radical left supporters.   Trump then refused to condemn White Supremacy because he would lose the support of his radical right supporters.
Biden didn't have to say a word. Automation speaks for him with a tweet and retweet from the centrally owned liberal media outlets.

It is going to end with a sweeping victory for Biden and Democratic control of the senate. Trump humiliated, out of power, and facing multiple criminal investigations, and best of all, the Republican party smoldering in a heap of ashes. That's ending quite well
Thank God we have Biden. Praise be. If we had Bernie, we would get 4 more years in hell with trump. You far left progressive bernie bros have no awareness of reality at all. None

I'm old enough to remember these are things Biden did say and there are many more. He is the racist and it's sad y'all can't see through this lifetime lying politician
You must count Biden's sarcastic chuckling as interruptions also.
The President also Donated 1.6 Million Dollars of his Salary. I think that's a Tax Donation. Biden is still living off his son's private equity from China.
I know it made me so mad Trump is the opposite of a racist Biden is the true racist I’m not black unless I vote for him Okay sure Joe
Now do how many times did Trump interrupt Biden or make kindergarten noises during his two minutes.

If I had a dollar for every time Trump interrupted Biden, I would have paid more income tax than the president.
I plan to vote in person this November.  I heard Trump telling his supporters to go to the polls as "observers ". All I can say is that they Better NOT get between me and my goal to vote Biden.  As an RN of over 25 years,  I Know how to Handle BULLIES. #VoteHimOut
I can hardly look at Biden with all that botox in his mouth.
The Biden campaign thank Brad for his donation.
I’m pretty sure Biden took a shot at Trumps son first.
Biden was quoting the FBI. And please share your sources on your Antifa statement.
My thoughts exactly. Please allow Biden to speak, follow the rules you agreed to.
Hold on, I didn't know Hunter was deceased. I was already mad because he had went into personal territory and talked about Biden's son and his problems (like Trump's idiotic sons don't have their own), but I didn't know he had passed. 😠
If you think Biden is with us blacks you have lose your damn mind !!
By the end of the day do you think Biden is with us? Meaning the people who going out there ready to vote for him because you sick of the orange man “lying” and being “ racist”
Just going to say this about all this damn political stuff are we going to take one sorry debate and crown y’all King? Because Trump exposed stuff Obama camp did and Biden exposed Trump stuff camp did.
They think the voters are stupid!We have no brains!WeDon’t search4truth!But we are smart&amp;we do see the truth&amp;we see lies&amp;Biden is a liar!He called myPresident a liar&amp;Wallace let him &amp;wouldn’t let Trump call him on it when Trump is the President &amp;knows the truth! We know truth too
Chris Wallace would not let Trump defend himself from the liars Biden and Wallace liars are nasty people who will go to hell
This girl commented on my Facebook post saying that Biden was the real racist and Trump has done way more for black people than anyone,and boy they getting her up outta here in the comments!! 😂😂
Joe Biden will do that, as soon as Trump releases his taxes and tells us who he owes 400 Million too.
NO Biden lied like a dog and Wallace refused to let Trump show that degenerate sex offender was LYING
What would Biden do for the jobs he and obama sent to China that were impossible to come back not happening they said

Biden Once Again Dodges On Whether He Supports Expanding &amp; Packing The Supreme Court With Liberals
So Biden’s plan is to weatherize 4 million homes ? That will solve the global warming hoax and create millions of jobs ?
Trump and Biden spent most of the 90-minute debate talking over each other as they tried to argue their points.Not for dementia. Biden has tested positive over and over again.
Suspending negative ads is more than Trump deserves.  He would never show Vice President Biden the same respect!
Trump’s taking a break from the media to re-emerge a champ for beating the virus before 11/3 &amp; before Biden had a chance to do it.  #Brilliant 😉
Wrong. He was asked to do it, offered to do it and then Wallace and Biden talked over him and changed the subject bc they didn't REALLY want him to do it with so many watching.
It does have a lot of irony embedded. I guess that means that Presidentis recognized by racist whites that the President isn’t racist and Biden could be?

We’re praying for you to make a full and swift recovery so you can get back on the campaign trail and kick creepy Joe Biden’s ass! God bless you &amp; Melania, Mr President!
imagine what it would be like to have puppet Biden in office and running mate. A horrible night mare.
Just a reminder that Trump mocked Biden last Tuesday night for wearing a mask “all the time” and for not holding large events. Joe, Jill, and his campaign staff are all healthy tonight.
I don’t even have a name for you. Please talk about Pelosi out in China Town, come on down. And Cuomo inviting people to come on to NY. And Biden calling for ceasing the ban on people from China. Karma is a bitch buddy
No way. I’m watching Food TV and seeing lots of trump campaign ads bashing Biden. If he dishes it he should get it thrown back at him.
Biden supports unrestricted abortion up until birth. There is nothing crueler than injecting acid or forceps  into a woman's womb and killing an innocent baby.
Biden lie? Only when he has the brain cells to form a sentence.
I think VP Biden sets a tone all should follow.  Thank you, sir.
Would they do that for Biden? Hell No, so Biden presses on.
Man I know first all you are a good person condemn in the president and your own ways is not you. Absolutely Trump is not perfect nobody asked for a perfect president Davis ask for a president a leader that would lead them in the right direction Clayton you know it's not Biden.
No CNN is hurting for viewers the president will be in office another four years, I don’t know but a few people who would vote for Biden, and they far, and few between TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏
Seriously. Trump has chosen to push dangerous non-mask policies and has made it political. He has belittled Biden &amp; others for being careful. Now he pays the price but Biden reaps the rewards of being prudent.

There’s no uncertainty here, we are certain that the demonic party is going to loose and loose horribly. We are certain that good will triumph over evil. We are certain that anything you publish is mostly lies. We are certain that joe Biden loves to grope and sniff girls. Facts
Because you are a class guy and have morals. Biden/Harris2020!!
No, Chris Wallace, you do with your biased questions. Example: Trump, do you denounce white supremacy? Biden: no question about Antifa. Which one has been burning down cities and bullying people minding their own business?
Yes!! Change pants little johnny Roberts wife your nose and ask biden to denounce antifa!!
So  and his wife tested positive for covid-19 after he makes fun of Biden for wearing his mask,talk about karma!!!
Oh please dude. What if Biden fakes having intellect.

His opinion ( Chris Wallace )! Ask the public .... I think it was started by Biden and Wallace piled on. Wallace is a registered Democrat.  Unfair and Unbalanced.
Yes vote for Donald J Trump and not this traitor Biden, he is a Trojan horse 🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏽
BIDEN, AND WALLACE IN BROCK BACK MOUNTAIN 😂🤣😂
How many times does this president have denounced white supremacy he has done it as far as Charlottesville that I can remember. Enough is enough nobody has pushed Joe Biden on all the racist things he said
Chris Wallace says post debate Trump started interrupting Biden . According to my recollection it was Biden beginning the interruptions and name calling ? Fact check? What was your observation?  Also Chris was blaming the problems on Trump. It actually was Biden-Wallace against T
John Roberts, if you had any backbone you would tell everyone that Trump has never supported white supremacy and his actions for minorities has proven it.  Did Biden ever back white supremacist or do any to hurt black persons? I say yes.
I agree with Joy, wholeheartedly.   Joe Biden  does not have to prove himself anymore, he's  running against an IDIOT.
You have changed for the worse.Why not ask why Biden was reading his answers from paper below suggesting he already had the andwers???
Wrong as usual. Watch the first 5 minutes of the debate. It was Joe Biden that was talking over The PRESIDENT. He started it, Trump finished it. And who had to resort to name calling? Your loser!!
The way Biden carrying himself cause of Trumps antics is really starting to piss me off.
Is that all everyone can say for Biden? He’s empathetic? Man, I don’t need him to be empathetic for me. I have family and friends for that! I need a president to watch borders, defend the nation...you know BIG stuff!
Also wanna point out how at the end of the debate, the Trumps looked like business partners and the Biden’s looked like an actual married couple. Old news tho
Payments were made to an investment firm, from a person that Trump himself has known for a long time. Not saying it was a setup to try to make Hunter Biden look bad, but that's certainly what it looks like to me.
Bruh Biden rlly scared to look trump in the eye
Just like Obama “You can keep your doctor”. They don’t mind lying to win and then doing the opposite and bragging “It worked, didn’t it?” We should study Trump’s policies and then know that is exactly what he will do, unlike Biden.
Joe Biden is a crook
Here’s a question, would you take my $1000 betJoe Biden is going to win by a landslide? Put your money where your mouth is
I just imagine the words joe Biden would say to other powerful world leaders.. “folks” 😂
Did you know that Biden started at an HBCU? He said he did but that's a lie. He said he graduated in the top half of his law school class. He finished near the bottom. Another lie. I guess you learned Hillary is guilty so you're changing the subject  You're still wrong.
Democrats always accuse you of doing what they are doing. Case in point, Biden accused Trump of being a liar when he is constantly caught lying. Here's one example, and he told this same lie last night during the debate.
The only question one should consider if only choosing between the two legacy party candidates is this: Will Joe Biden serve the principles of economic liberty, personal liberty, and international non-aggression better than Donald Trump? They both have records now.
if you say your about facts and journalism why will you not just ask Biden if he wore any type of device to communicate with others off stage? Not a hard question to answer so should not be hard to ask. If you truly want to get to facts
You left this one out. Biden stated he didn’t support the Green New Deal, someone tell him his web site says different
Y’all so funny, Biden interrupted Trump just as much, y’all are just blind.
Interesting Donnie is bashing Biden on Food Channel. Guess he is trying to appeal to suburban voters. But not all of us are cult members. Hit Mute when his ad pops up

Where can I find one of those “biggest mask you’ve ever seen” that Trump claims Biden wears? As an overall large person, I would like to know because these normal size masks ain’t cutting it
My career is behind the camera. The frontal angle of Biden from a zoom lens will compress the distance perceived. The side shot helps show how much distance the troops were behind him.
who did it better? Trump/Biden or Jim from Ttown/ Charles from real town?
And now I'm picturing Joe Biden doing the Harvey Korman instructional video bit.
Hell I would rather neither honestly, I don’t like either, but shut keep goin the way it’s going It’ll be a Civil War, Biden is literally the lesser evil
Exactly, Wallace interrupted Biden 15 times, Wallace interrupted our President 76 times, not fair. Wallace is the worst moderator ever
the Biden Green Deal is basically the same as Green New Deal - just smaller big to start with.
Are you high? What debate did you watch? Read the statistics. Moderator challenged or cut off the President 76 times. Biden 15. That was at last count.
Interrupted by who? Trump was interrupted by the moderator 3 to 4 or more times Biden was. He was debating 2 people. Confronted with lies we would all get a little flustered.
Yes, thank you. No one could stand there and listen to someone just lie and not confront them on it. Wallace did a terrible job and laughed along with Biden on several occasions. Not professional.
Are you kidding me? I like many other people cannot Abide a liar. I doubt you could stand and listen to someone just lie after lie after lie and not get pissed off. And the moderator not only allowed this but asked no follow-up questions about Biden and his lying.
Counter argument from a lawyer: when you are questioning someone and they say something devastatingly harmful to their case, you move along. Don’t give them an opportunity to clear it up. Biden’s team is gleeful for the lack of follow up.
CD Your arguement fails on the facts- ( see Kirk’s numbers of interruptions). Did you even watch the debate performavpce by the tag team of Biden/Wallace vs Trump?
The GOP should never have agreed to Wallace being the” moderator”. It is doubtful that anyone did not know beforehand that Wallace would do everything he could to help hapless Senile Biden.
ABC News fact-checked Biden noted Trump condemned white supremacists after Charlottesville riots of Aug 2017, which Biden has also lied about.  A month later, the president signed a congressional resolution condemning white supremacy.
You have to be kidding. If Biden was president he would put us back in the same position Obama did, kowtowing to the Third World countries and Communists. Biden miss spoke half the time and the rest of the time he couldn’t get his thought out clearly. He has dementia sorry to say
And not to mention Biden wants to take our guns
Exactly, I thought he probably was wearing a Biden shirt
there’s so many things trump has done, mountains of things he has said that should have been it for him. And a lot of the things he says are much worse than this, but him bringing up Biden’s sons during the debate, one whom is dead.... i just will never get it.
Not that the truth matters to Trump supporters... but just in case.
This was not a debate - it was an argument. I still do not know what Joe Biden would do as President.
It was quite a love fest, Wallace even referenced Biden’s dad , how cozy
If your excuse is "Joe Biden was too disconnected from events to possibly have known he was commenting on them", maybe it's time you call for Joe to step aside.
It's almost as if Biden has staked out positions at both extremes on the matter at different points in his career and doesn't like being called to account for either one.
If we are complaining about Chris Wallace, then Trump lost and Biden won. Plain and simple.
Hannity: President Trump 'steamrolled' Biden in first debate
But Biden absolutely, proudly said “every major crime bill since 1976 that’s come out of this Congress, every minor crime bill, has had the name of the Democratic senator from the State of Delaware: Joe Biden.”.... And all targeted African American communities.
That’s because he has blood on his hands. Every cop that has been ambushed or targeted are a direct result of Biden giving validation to extreme groups such as BLM &amp; ANTIFA. PLEASE VOTE FOR TRUMP IF YOU SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT!
ABC's Martha Raddatz: 'There wasn't a whole lot of enthusiasm' for Biden during my road trip across America
Get your facts straight Paula, he was going after Hunter Biden and even corrected Joe Biden on this during the debate.
Actually, “he opens his lead on Biden” would be more accurate.  12-20% oversampling of Democrats giving a 8% lead in the fake polls for Biden means Trump is leading by 4-12%.
Don’t forget Biden’s brother who got a $1.5 billion U.S. government contract to build houses in Iraq when Biden was VP. Had never build a single house before.
Biden: "The suburbs are the most diverse they have ever been in systemically racist America."
Ok after I say that Wallace was the worst moderator ever. The rude trash taking street thug Biden is a jerk
#Debates2020 - well you are doing fact checking and your fact checker just said well she didn’t say those words but it is true. If she didn’t say those words that makes it false when Biden says she said it
So, why is it okay for Joe Biden to tell the POTUS to “Shut up, man!”?
Wallace is a fraud, he might as well had on a Biden shirt
Wallace was cruel to President Trump, he let his buddy Biden do most of the talking
What the hell did you expect?? You must not have been listening to all those horrible things Biden said about Trump tonight! Trump has put up with all their lies and treason for four years! GIVE HIM HELL, TRUMP!!!
I agree with Sean. Ari, you must be kidding! Biden &amp; Dems have been calling Trump everything but a child of God since before he was elected!! I’m glad knew what he was doing and SHOULD have give Joe HELL!
Yup Biden (assuming he wins) is just a 4yr fill in....unless he does something awesome
Fox News should fire Chris Wallace. He spent the whole time bailing out and helping Biden.
Biden’s people got him through 82 of 96 minutes of the debate by having him reply “He’s lying again”, “That a lie and you know it” no matter what the facts were and Trump was almost always stating previously proven truth. Summary for Biden: I’m not Trump.
Neither candidate has giving me a reason to vote for them to be honest but Biden is the lesser of two evils IMO!!!
hmmmm...there was clear bias. furthermore, Joe Biden was lying through his teeth the whole time and wasn’t held accountable except by Trump. Trump had to debate both Chris Wallace and Biden.
Hopefully the crap he’s been doing the last 4 years will be enough. Your vote does matter! Biden is our only hope to end this insanity. He’s not a perfect fix but I just need the bleeding to stop right now and he’ll be a fine tourniquet! ❤️
hopefully someone on the panel can discuss  running interference for Joe Biden during the entire debate, and not pushing Biden on his refusal to answer questions?
Yes 100%. They have got it in their minds that if Biden wins we will be a Socialist country. We had Clinton 8 years Obama 8 We didn’t have that then. It’s an excuse. I think they want to go back to the Good Old Days with all white people and the blacks are okay “in their place”.
Top, if it’s with Biden lol. I remember watching Obama use his quick wit to outsmart Romney and I really liked it. Both sides were telling lies btw but Trump seemed more alive in a debate of two geriatrics nobody likes and devoid of the quick wit Obama had.
Bigger question. Why wont Biden condemn Antifa. They are literally burning down cities but Noooooo, muh white supremacy.
Biden will be retiring a lot earlier then.
He beat Biden and Wallace.
Man, President Trump acted like a petulant child for an hour and a half, and I'm not sure who comes out on top. Biden looked bad at points in performance. Substance? Biden. Showmanship? May have been Trump. #PresidentialDebate2020

Chris Wallace is so biased toward Biden. Thanks for showing your true colors. I’m done with your network. #corrupt
There’s no point in responding to every baseless or discredited accusation Trump throws. Trump spent most of his time interrupting Biden to slander him and his family. He IS a clown. lol
His strategy looks to be to try to get Biden so confused that he can elicit multiple soundbites that make Biden sound senile. But even the most completely lucid person would have a hard time getting through this without a "what the what are you why did you...?"
Oh, I don't like either of them. My vote doesn't matter anyway, so I could vote for Mickey Mouse, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, or President Trump with the same outcome.
Literally did the climate debate for Biden
Talking bad about Bo Biden struggle with drug addiction, wow...new low for the office of President of The United States#Debates2020
Loved it!  Biden’s IQ is chump change compared to President Trump.
This just be the last debate. Why should Biden deal with this clown show? Trump lies about lies and then lies some more. What a psychopath.
Why is Joe Biden allowed to interrupt and take your time but you are being admonished?
Trump: "Why did he get ten million dollars?"  Biden in my head: "If he really got that, im mad about the tie he got me for Christmas. Nah, that's hogwash."  #PresidentialDebate2020
Wallace rescued Biden from that.
Strongest moment for Biden might have been talking about Bo. #PresidentialDebate2020
Chris Wallace is a horrible moderator!  You know it, I know it and the American people know it! Totally protecting Biden!
Already down many times. When will Biden admit ANITFA and denounce them
Why didn't he ask Biden to condemn white supremacists?
Damn I hate Trump with all of me but Biden is Obama after a good edible and some agent orange.
Wallace is doing a good job of challenging Biden, and Trump still can't shut up.  #PresidentialDebate2020

Biden says, “We have to have a system where people are held accountable.” Trump can’t understand that because he doesn’t recognize the concept of accountability.
What a joke. How does that stand up against Trump being impeached for withholding aid from Ukraine in exchange for dirt on Biden?  #Debates2020
Trump says Biden has treated black people badly and that’s why so many support him. Trump has worsened racial tensions to levels many have never seen. 😡

No, but you will when Biden loses.
A Poll in Pennsylvania Biden was only up 9 % points. Why? A book was written about southern white voters years ago. It was called WHY VOTERS VOTE AGAINST THEIR BEST INTEREST. Working class non college white men support Adolf Trump 58 to 41%. We need to educate a lot of morons!
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris release their 2019 tax returns
You have more faith in Chris Wallace than I do. I suspect he will fawn over Biden, perhaps ask what his favorite dessert is, then unleash his fury on President Trump.
I wish Biden had asked Barack Obama to come to the debate tonight and sit in the front row and stare at Crooked Donnie.
Hahaha. He might be scared of some things but debating Biden is certainly not one of them
Biden has been guilty of plagiarism multiple times. Now let’s see Hunter Biden’s returns. Also, let’s see Joe’s returns for taxes paid in other countries.
Everyone should prepare for Joe Biden coming out profusely spitting at the mouth &amp; screaming after being dosed up on some sort of performance enhancing drug. By the time the 80 minute mark hits, #SleepyJoe will be crashing. Wait and watch!!
Bet on Biden!! The media has already declared him the winner! 😳
I find it hilarious the Biden campaign is pulling the “Trump Tax Returns” card out of their circus van. Hillary openly campaigned about it in 2016 &amp; mentioned it during one of the debates. I don’t vote for whatever presidential candidate has the best tax returns. DESPERATE Joe!!
Just better hope Biden can stay awake for 90 minutes. He be ok if he gets his two naps breaks. I wouldn’t be surprised if Biden gets mad and walks off stage.
Trump’s gonna crawl under the podium and tie Biden’s shoelaces together

I was a fervent Romney/Ryan supporter and was crushed when Biden dismantled Ryan in their VP debate. I am hoping that Joe does the same to Trump tonight.

He probably gave up at this point I don't even think Biden's wife understands his incoherent thought process. They'll probably pump him full of addy tomorrow so he sounds somewhat intelligent
Who cares if Trump only paid $750 in taxes. He was only using the system that Biden and Pelosi help create. Any business owner should take full advantage of any tax loopholes.
Why oh why did Hunter Biden get $3.5 million from the wife of a Russian Mayor? What did he do for the money? OR, What is he expected to do for the money? We shall see.
“Shades” Biden is going to have to come out from behind those Foster Grants tomorrow night and face the issues.
Ohh  I Got Four Scoops And First One is Tomorrow Night Be Sure To Tune In To Round 1 Of The President Debate Of Joe Biden Vs Donald Trump.
Someone broke the law by giving this info. Plus where is story on Joe Biden and son Hunter???just as newsworthy. But one day before debates you throw out this shit. Disappointed and disgusted. But don’t expect more from you and others on left
Wait. What did Trump accuse Biden of?
What is a Maui?  I know black women age 18 to 30 are so crazy about him, half would rape him in public with their boyfriend or husband watching to hear them talk, but I figure Biden already has that demographic nailed down.
You have ZERO tweets/discussion regarding the Hunter Biden news. Please explain how you are “news”. Do you all at CNN not realize that all of America see your partisan behavior? Just bc you all ignore it doesn’t mean the majority of America is to dumb to recognize the hypocrisy.

Carlos, they aren’t Biden supporters. They’re party supporters who want to belly up to the public trough again. They’re jealous of Hunter’s deals.

Oh,  he'll try to check Biden but not his friend.
Bush wasn’t in stage 12 dementia. Biden is.
voting at all in this system, between these two choices, feels to me like being complicit in fascism. I have no problem with people who vote for biden, but given his and kamala’s track record it feels very much like a vote for the continuation of the current oppressive system.
I see the logic in that, but at the same time is it morally permissible to vote for such a horrific person even if it’s to keep a more horrific person from taking office? I don’t know if I can bring myself to vote for biden. He’s the better of the two main choices, for sure, but
Can't happen. Biden's urine is under audit.Who thinks? Who knows Biden, Harris will destroy our country.
Nothing is far-fetched in 2020. By election day, both Trump and Biden could be out of the race.
I’m very happy to have the opportunity to vote for both Joe Biden and Doug Jones this year (and Kamala Harris too!!!) 💙💛💙💛
3 years ago today, Joe Biden came to Birmingham to campaign for Doug Jones. That was the day I knew something special was happening in Alabama.
Biden's a fucking joke but Trump has actively supported white supremacist groups, taken out full page adds calling for the execution of black teens in the past.  That quote is fucking awful, but literally the next words out of his mouth was a correction.
Trump did not wear a mask, and used the event to mock his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, for following social distancing guidelines. "You ever see the gyms with the circles?" Referencing a Biden event held in a school gym with attendees observing social distancing guidelines.
I don't want Trump to have or die of this virus even if he's a terrible human being. But, I will LOL at a Biden meme.
Yes!! it was no slip-up when both said Harris/Biden ticket.
took care of that for you, in the case that you have no insurance. Now if you have the REALLY shitty Obamacare I don’t know what to tell you. Vote for Biden and maybe he’ll fix it 😂
Wishing you &amp; Melania a speedy recovery, we need you back!!  Side note: If you’re here to be an asshole, can you maybe give it ONE DAY. Even Biden pulled his negative ads. Maybe you could just chill for a minute, or does the hate never stop with the left?
Using history as an example, I can almost guarantee you that if/when Biden is elected president, it's never going to be confronted. Look at the United States after the Civil War. The country was so willing to "get things back to normal" that the south was completely forgiven.

Joe Biden tests negative for coronavirus, wishes Trump speedy recovery
Biden should never have agreed to stop any Trump ads. Sometimes it's possible to be too civilized. It just makes you a perpetual victim.
Since  is only going to run positive ads right now, here's my positive pitch for him:  I'm POSITIVE Joe Biden will be a decent, ethical President. I'm POSITIVE he will care about the well-being of his family, his staff, his supporters, and everyone in this country.
Biden isn’t quarantining, so I by your assessment he has no integrity. 🤔
Hell, no. Trump would have doubled down on the negative ads. Would anyone have been surprised?  But, Biden has taken the high road on this situation. Nobody can come back later and complain that Biden was kicking a man when he was down.
Biden campaign pulls all negative ads, and this is how Trump’s campaign responds. At every opportunity to show even the slightest bit of class, this is the way they choose to go over and over.
And “they” expect sympathy from the Biden camp? Despicable.
And Joe Biden is a bad idea . 😂😂😂😂

Biden is a good man
Why I am Voting Biden. US founded on good of all. Biden pulled negative ads whilt trump sick. Trump would have used the illness to call Biden old and weak. If Biden were sick. Biden good man, trump evil man. I have no anger for trump, just a desire to stop all the death and chaos

I feel so bad for Biden’s team today.  Navigating the pandemic in the US has become a test of creativity and attempting to mitigate risk. You have to start from a basis of trust that everyone around you is doing the same.
Donald Trump Jr is most likely controlled by a cocaine addiction by now, even as his own father, showing all signs of an Adderall dependency, chose to use Hunter Biden's addiction against Joe Biden in the debate. Biden's response helped lift the stigma against addiction.
Meanwhile 208,000+ Americans are dead, and it is likely we will see more of those close to Trump's inner circle testing positive. The Biden campaign is likely very PISSED about the nonchalant way Trump and his ilk have handled Hope Hick's diagnosis.

Biden and Hillary never condemned the Grand Wizard of the KKK Sen Robert Byrd a Democrat. No, both Joe's in the picture, celebrated with him.
Biden’s camp is at least transparent about what they release to the press. Joe will never hide anything that endangers his inner circle and the press corps.
By all accounts that disaster of a debate only helped Biden, so I guess now’s the time to lean extra hard into bonding with your peers by insulting the people you want to vote for him.

No she didn’t dance around it you idiots. Roberts is just pissed his wife was called out yesterday. For Christ sakes enough already!!  Biden is the won who was a supporter and great friend of Byrd who was a member of the KKK and proud of it. Maybe Biden was a closet member too.

Most of Trump’s base still vehemently support him. Not only do they support Trump more than Democrats support Biden, but I could argue they love Trump more than Democrats hate him.  That could prove to be problematic for Biden.

Oh, did Biden reject BLM, Antifa and the riots? I guess I missed that.
We aren't worried about what Biden did 20 yrs ago. He grew up. We are terrified by trump's constant anti US bumbling drivel. Look around, trump destroys anything he is involved in.
The deflection game from Democrats is in full effect....  "Trump is a racist", is all they can think of to distract from Biden's real racism, and the FISA abuse hearings with Comey  #

Personally, I don't believe Mr. Biden has the ability to stand up to the people threatening our very way of life. His record speaks for itself. But, there will never be peace until a president is willing to stand in front of camera and tell the American people racism in all forms

Biden has a had a stutter his entire life that he’s busted his ass to get over.
Go back and watch the debate. Biden over spoke first.  Is that an excuse for a bar brawl? No. But just saying.

Joe Biden is racist. Prove me wrong
Looks like your right, Biden has spoken against violence. Good for him. I hope it is effective. Many things getting out of hand.
Thinking that other people are going to vote for Biden for you is how Biden loses
Ideologies lead to a group of people taking action for what they believe. In this case riots in the street which causes destruction and division. If Biden and Jones are so confident they will win in Nov then why don’t they tell them to be peaceful? Both parties guilty of division

Yes. But I’d really like to see all of the details of the “Non-profits” these politicians like Biden run. And their shell companies they open to stash all their illegitimate income and dealings.
Where did you read that Biden changed his mind? That is not true. He still supports a Federal Mask Mandate.
If Biden had told Antifa to stand down, he might have saved lives.   Instead, he praised them while denying their existence, and said he couldn’t condemn left-wing violence because he “wasn’t an elected official.”  No, he’s just not a leader.

I thought Trump could’ve been a lot better. He didn’t need to keep interrupting, bringing up Hunter Biden, &amp; rambling on about numerous judges. People don’t care about Hunter Biden. Just keep pointing out the positive economic recovery &amp; Biden’s plan to slap all those taxes on us

How could someone come out of this debate saying: "Joe Biden will make a great President? "   Joe Biden can barely make cohesive thought.
I dare say Biden was not “dignified”.   The useful idiots Saul Alinsky refers to is actually the media.
Go watch the debate. Biden literally said his 4 trillion tax hike to in his words, fund 1mm new energy efficient homes and more in that regard. You raise taxes those businesses will flee. They did it during the obama administration. Those jobs flee with them.
Vote Biden, the sane choice.

How can anybody look at last night and feel confident that their vote would change anything? Like I do think Biden is the better candidate. I'll prolly vote for him. But I also understand why people wouldn't. This shit is a mess and voting won't fix shit in the long run
You TROUNCED him TRUMP !!!
I'm a fairly old man who has watched and kept up with politics since my early teens. Ever since Joe Biden has come to the national political forefront he has made bold and ambitious campaign promises. The only one I have ever known of him to keep was his promise to raise taxes.
If Biden loses this election it won’t be about votes. 👍🏾
Biden learned better. Trump still hates all but white men. Your pres has so little self control he can't follow rules, forget following laws. Look around, trumps US is the one he warns you about if Biden elected. Try to THINK!

There were no lies about Hunter Biden from Trump. H.B. has used the contact of his father or his father used him to collect $$.  Where is this money collected from the Mayor of Moscow’s wife,  Ukraine,  and China?  The only lie was Biden’s  denial.

From an observation: I get excited that people in their F-150s support Joe Biden. Whenever I see ppl in their pickups, I think of Donald Trump. I rode through some neighborhoods and saw these types parked in a driveway with Biden signs on their front lawn.
Except Spencer supports Biden. Lol
He was for Biden. He did not do a good job.
No one on the Biden team has asked to cancel a debate. They are the ones who make the call, not "the media". Your guy imploded, as expected, so write that story.
I voted for Warren by the way, not like that matters to you, but I’m voting for Biden because Trump is a fascist and I don’t like fascism.
One change being considered: giving the moderator the ability to cut off the microphone of one of the debate participants while his opponent is talking
Gov. Marc Racicot, once the chairman of the RNC, said today he'll be voting for Joe Biden over President Trump.  Another one ditching Trump. And he's just one of those that is admitting it publicly. How many others are jumping ship but are afraid to say so?
Stop towing the DNC line then and run 3rd party. If you actually cared about people you’d help break up the duopoly control. Biden isn’t gonna get it done.
Supporting someone as president shouldn’t change what you see someone as a person. It doesn’t matter if Tim supported either Biden or Bernie I would still love the man I may not agree with the person but I will still watch and support him. Republicans are scared to say anything
Biden’s stock was built in because a. He wasn’t a woman b. He wasn’t as far Left as Bernie, it was basically over after South Carolina.
Biden's budget increases funding to police. Trumps budget cuts (defunds) money for police. Verify anything trump tells you. Read, think!
It is not true that Biden has done nothing. 42 Bill's sponsored and cosponsored. Most politicos only manage 1 or 2. Bill's ivolvi g equality, public health, women's rights, etc, etc. Trump lies to you. Look it up.
Still thinking about the privilege that Biden, as a cis hetero white man, has in debating Trump. If that had been Obama or HRC--the last two Dem nominees--none of them would've gotten to tell Trump to "shut up, man." (Not that Trump doesn't deserve that.)
You are out of luck.  Trump and Biden both do not support the #GreenNewDeal
Not supporting the #GreenNewDeal was the only intelligent statement Biden made last night.
Yes but I think it's because Trump is far more personally successful than Biden and not for any other reason. Trump is his own man and Biden is a democratic puppet.

It's like Trump and biden have a lot of common traits or something
Chris Wallace asked Biden about the coming trillions of dollars in taxes he’s going to slap on us, if he’s elected, &amp; Biden couldn’t avoid it or deny it. That’s about as tough as it gets, because raising taxes is a campaign killer...a show stopper. Nobody wants higher taxes.
Yup, Trump's shithole America that turns everything filthy.
But saying one white supremacist supports Biden is a lot different than a majority that is actually supporting Donny.
I'll vote Biden for that reason, but I'm concerned there'll be violence and an attempted coup if he wins.

Well I’ve heard whining this morning from Dale Jackson, Matt Murphy, and now Limbaugh. All agreed it was Biden and all have blamed Wallace😎
His bias showed! If he asked  to condemn white supremacy, he should have asked Biden to condemn ANTIFA and BLM but he didn't and on top of that, he let him get away with saying ANTIFA was an "idea".
My Maga dad didn’t wanna talk about trump today. So ... uhh we’re fucked on the left right? If Biden wins over republicans he’ll never move back that way and just slide right forever

No, what actually happened was that every time Trump had Biden on the ropes, Chris Wallace butted in and changed the subject so Biden wouldn't have to respond.
Good. They should. Patently false and also immature and reprehensible on Biden's part.
Incorrect. Biden used the term Law and Order while promising to help get psychologists into the police force while you emboldened the white nationalists. You’re basically becoming the equivalent of the Grand Wizard of the national New Ku Klux Klan. Good luck, George Wallace JR.
Yes and Donna Brazile with him! Can’t believe they hired her in the first place. Biden was reading his answer at one point, did he get the questions?? Probably.
Trump and Biden ahh about to blow away with the wind soon. 🤦🏾‍♂️ President shouldn’t be this old
I'm not sure what the "far-left" is. I support the Green New Deal myself, so I'm a bit underwhelmed here, but he is right in saying he's the Democratic Party because he's the nominee and the nominee's platform is the party platform. I already voted absentee for Biden, no regrets.
Did you watch the debate last night? What are your thoughts?
This is classic Biden outreach. No wonder he’s gonna get obliterated.   88% of democrats want M4A 70% want cannabis legal 60% want a GND &gt;50% want free public college and loan forgiveness.  This ain’t radical left. It’s literally the base being ignored.
So you don’t think Biden has blown off the left?   He said he’d veto m4a, doesn’t support a GND, when told about kids drowning in student loans (which is HIS fault specifically) he said “I have no sympathy”.  Biden is a neoliberal asswipe who’s only in it bc Obama made some calls
I’ll take that 5k and vote for Biden dripped in Gucci. People also don’t realize that it would have to pass the House and Senate and we all know a bill like that won’t come from Republicans.
During the debate, Biden refused to answer several questions, not only from President Trump but also from his 'bud', Chris.
“Antifa is just an idea” Joe Biden   Not only did he not tell them to stand down he didn’t even acknowledge them as an organization. Both are missing the mark
Steamrolled? So that's a fair tactic now? And yes, Joe Biden used interruptions and names, but far fewer times than Donald Trump had. So no, this does not result in a Trump victory. Strange how I see shades of Margaret Thatcher's last days 30 years ago in Trump.
Love this new name Smoking Joe Biden 🌊🌊🌊🌊
The joe biden inshallah tweets were alright, everything else was some hacky political "both sides suck" bullshit
Who won the debate? Neither. Biden stumbled and stammered. 47 years in government office and nothing to his credit. Trump was rude and abrasive, couldn’t keep his mouth shut when it wasn’t his turn to speak
Biden basically told Trump to Git good
Lie’n Biden at it again . Stupidest human ever paraded out
Joe Biden is a lying sack of used dog food, lies come spewing out of his mouth. He knows Trump never said the things he’s accusing him of saying about men in the Armed Forces. As a Korean War vet I resent his comments. Trump has built up our military.
Trump: "Joe Biden is going to do a thing that will benefit working people and poor people."  Biden: "NO! I MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!"  ~~ I'm voting green because they are the only party that is offering single-payer healthcare and a green new deal.
Biden wasn’t acting he didn’t know anything. You ever got into a argument with a mfer and they are talking over you, you can’t get not one piece of a statement in. So you just be like you can have it mfer shit, because you not about to argue with they bitch ass lol
Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes...a lot. That’s all I needed to see &amp; hear last night, before I switched it over to the Vols vs South Carolina rewind. I’m counting on those continued Trump tax cuts.
And fwiw I’m not going into the streets to fight a Nazi just to put Joe Biden in office. He’s blatantly disregarded the entire left wing of the US in favor of chasing republicans votes. So he can have them.   If you want change it isn’t coming from the ballot box.

I haven’t heard anybody mention the fact that Joe Biden said he would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% isn’t that a big deal in scary for business owners ?

Chris Wallace owes  and American people an apology. Absolutely worse moderated debate in history. Trump had to debate Wallace and Biden. Wallace lose fox base his show will tank.
What are your thoughts on last night's #PresidentialDebate? What stood out to you? Did it influence who you will vote for? #Debates2020
It is a lie to equate the words and actions of Trump &amp; Biden.
Trump: "My opponent is going to do a thing that will benefit the working class and poor"  Joe Biden: "NO I WILL MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT!"
Honestly. Biden has some moments where he did get Rocked. His tone would go up and quieter when he didn’t quite no how to answer and trumpet tried his best to knock him off with constant interruptions. Trunk should have let him stumble on his own words.
Trump allowed Biden to paint him as a heartless millionaire/billionaire.   DT missed huge swing to hit back that Biden is a multimillionaire and earned $950k last year with no career except “public service”
Hunter Biden is about as crooked as they come tbh
The 2 in 10 who viewed the debate as positive were Trump and Biden #Debates2020
Nobody won. The American people lost. Biden did as well as anyone could wrestling a pig.
With regards to Biden and antifa? I feel like Chris Wallace let him off the hook. I also feel like Chris Wallace was a little bit of a bodyguard to use the words of a buddy of mine. I'm not even sure Biden answered the question.
I saw commentary after saying that Biden's camp thought he did a good job at showing he could be the adult in the room... while calling the president a clown, telling him to shut up, etc. They both acted like children. They literally acted like my 5 and 7 y/o going back and forth
Then follows with the ‘stand back and stand down’ statement after Wallace finished his question. Biden refuses to acknowledge Antifa - ship I don’t play into conspiracy theories, it’s obviously more than an idea.
Lmao imagine being so fucking dumb to think Radical Leftists support Biden
Last night at the beginning of the debate, Trump was calmer than I expected (oranger too), and I remember thinking Biden was going to need to rattle him. He obviously did and we got that awful debate.
Biden: D, Trump: C-, Wallace, C
You said, “… Biden supports helping police weed out the police who commit crimes and have them be held accountable.”  But they literally violently resist the tiniest bit of accountability, so I’m not sure how one helps them apply any.Champ Biden for First Dog❤️💜💙

Fair question, seeing as how Trump has tested positive for Covid, as have a handful of other members of his team, 3 days after teasing Biden for wearing masks
Biden is a complete idiot. I would love to punch him in the face.
So Biden says wear a mask as he touches his make several times. Follow the science he says. Well stop touching your face.

Good thats how it should be. Trump didn't scale back his plans to install a new justice after RBG passing.   And if Biden got Covid, I highly doubt Trump would stop or slow down his efforts at campaigning.
So Biden has been in office for 47 years and has zero accomplishments where President Trump has been in office for only 4 years and has accomplished more than Biden and Obama did
That’s what I was thinking ! It’s all s he can avoid b I got embarrassed by Biden

If #TrumpIsARacist uses #COVID19 as the reason for not being able to debate then we better just get 90 mins of Joe Biden clearly and effectively explaining his plans to the people so everyone understands more clearly.
Exactly. They found the little footage they have of Trump wearing  a masm when just on Tuesday he mocked Biden for wearing a mask as often as he does

Everyone just needs to assume Biden will pack the court, if elected. It’s simple. End of debate. 🤷🏻‍♀️
How many times does a person, the President of the USA, have to state the same thing? Hello, MSM aka Lamestream media, he has called the KĶK a domestic terrorist group. He has disavowed hate and violent groups repeatedly. Why hasnt Biden disavowed Antifa and the KKK?
How does it feel. This is what republicans have heard for the past democratic presidential years. Obama Biden lying years.  And I know you just learned those big words.  “Equivocation and Pontificate. Wow!  #Trumpdenounceskkk #Trump2020
“45 percent of likely voters believe Trump underperformed expectations at the debate, while only 11 percent said that Biden performed worse...”  Trump made a YUGE strategic error in setting expectations low for Biden. And in not shutting up long enough to let Biden make mistakes.
Here it is liberals...Trump denounced the kkk, David Dukes and white supremacist...now when will Biden denounce BLM Marxist and Antifa Marxist?

I will be critical as Hell toward Biden. I fully expect him to live up to his platform, dismantle the fascist scaffolding that's been erected, hold Trump accountable for COVID deaths, &amp; position the US to not only move further Left, but support policies that make it sustainable
Understand that I am not voting Biden to "swing the pendulum Left"  I am voting Biden to eventually lengthen the pendulum's arc so that it never swings Right ever again
Chris Wallace is still blaming the President and covering for Joe Biden. Get his ass off the TV!!!!!!!
Biden now lying about Constitution. Says constitution calls for newly elected congress and newly elected president to appoint and approve Justice once voting starts. Current President and Congress cannot. Have to wait 3 months for newly elected. Not true and another Biden lie.

Trump could have handled the issue a ton better. He’s a dunce. That being said, why is no one questioning the fact that Biden doesn’t think ANTIFA is a thing?

You people have no right to send anybody to watch me cast my vote whether it is for Trump or Biden. If I catch someone spying on me I will knock the hell out them and you. Then you can call the proud boys.
Has anyone from the Biden camp said anything about the wires that were seen on Joe during the debate?
CRICKETS: Just 1 PERSON on Entire CNN Panel of Voters Thinks ‘Joe Biden ...
I’m speaking technically about the issue. My point is that although his discharge wasn’t “Dishonorable”, it was still Other Than Honorable, rather than the BS line from Biden supporters that it was just an administrative separation.
Two things. #1 Donald Trump less than 48 hours ago tried to smear Joe Biden with his son’s issue with substance abuse. So this PSA is tone deaf and repugnant. #2 What is with the fucking body angle? This isn’t a perfume ad. Ridiculous.
Did everyone forget that hunter Biden took bribes as a public servant???? And that his father Joe Biden tried to cover it up???
I’m at work and I just overhead the guy across from me on the ohne saying “Joe Biden was best friends with Jim Crow, he delivered his eulogy, why didn’t Trump mention that when Biden mentioned being racist” 🥴🥴🥴
Biden stood up for his sons. That's what a father does.
Biden wears a wire so they want to add a mute button to silence Trump. If Biden isn't man enough to stand up to Trump he doesn't deserve to win. Wallace ran interference for Biden and he still lost.
Trump Won Wallace Second Biden Finished LAST  via
The debate commission wants to give Biden a Trophy he didn't earn. Biden can't hold his own against Trump even with a biased moderator. They want to rig the debates to mute Trump and let Biden have more time to lie. Biden can't win on the merits so they have to cheat for him.
Why post that if you didn't see the whole thing. Biden won one hand to Trump zero hands. so 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Because Joe Biden is SANE!
"Gentlemen, the rules for the 2nd debate are as follows: Pres. Trump will have 15 minutes to speak uninterrupted, at which time VP Biden will remain quiet. Then, VP Biden will be given the same opportunity. These will be pre-recorded. They're actually just ads. Turn off your TV."
he’s already seen this but show this to Chris Wallace.  He was there to protect Biden on his “never Trump” quest!!! Get rid of that POS!!!
... General Discharge or an Other Than Honorable Discharge. While it may be true that Biden did not receive a Dishonorable Discharge, it is impossible that he received an Honorable Discharge given the circumstances.

Still gonna win again. U learned well from hidin Biden. You can name call as good as him.ur also lack intelligence like him to. 2 peas in a pod u 2 r. Maybe u 2 can hug and cry together when he loses.
Speaking of lies, your claim is one.  Smh
Nice try but he put a foot in Trump ass last night. Biden!!
They would have to agree to it. I bet Biden would. I wonder if Trump’s handlers would?  But if they would prefer it over what he did last night, then Biden’s team probably shouldn’t.
Probably just change shirts to something anti-Biden.
What debate were you watching? The only reason tRump kept interrupting like the 5- year old that he is, was because Biden kept exposing the phonyness that he's work so hard to hide from his cult
everyone’s family’s has problems... doesn’t have anything to do with the person in question. joes son having a problem with dr*gs has nothing to do with this country... it would be so expensive to move out of the US so plz vote so biden can make it a better place at least...
Hewitt is just playing to his audience to keep ad $$$ flowing. He knows better. He’s sold his soul. He and Rush won’t change. In fact if Biden wins their audience may actually grow.
Chris Wallace was the problem, had he been honest, asked equal questions to both candidates and followed up to the questions equally, Trump would not have needed to constantly interrupt. He was too soft on Biden, if I were Trump I would have done the same thing.
1. According to Biden &amp; Harris masks work right..? Even though we are slowly killing ourselves by wearing one. 2. Are you not worried about voter fraud or your vote not being counted or what if the people counting the ballots are biased? I get what you’re saying, but personally -
i’m on the fence still... biden hasn’t fully grabbed me and convinced me.
Biden is laughing because he’s lying. Don’t let this man fool y’all. Wake up everyone.
Joe biden doesnt even know where he went to college.  Delaware state?

The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
And Biden looked more like two face a normal democrat politician. Telling you what u want hear with one face while doing the opposite with the other face
remember your boy Biden was buddies with Robert Byrd and praised George Wallace.
Attacking someone’s children (one dead and one that has a struggling problem) is BEYOND low. I could cry for Biden, honestly. Just too low of a blow, and he should be ashamed.  Not even talking about him not denouncing white supremacy... that’s just baffling. #vote #pleasevote
Excuse to cut off Trump's comments and let Biden get the last word on everything
I will for Trump. Trump is the first president to label KKK as terrorist. I do not believe he is a White Supremacist. But, what i found interesting is that Antifa and BLM are the one tearing up our country and they didnt ask Biden about it.
2020 has been absolutely ridiculous. I dont want another 4 years of this. Biden sucks but last night alone proved at least he has a plan. Trump literally picked on this man the entire night and offered NO solution 🤣🙏🏾
apparently if Trump has secret deals with overseas people its treason, but, if Biden does, media goes quiet. This is dangerous.
so let me get this straight, You want to completely change our economy and are saying biden, harris and AOC are trustworthy enough for you to say heck yes? Our economy is one of the greatest in the world. Did you see the numbers today? Did you see what Trump did prior to covid?
When President Trump mentioned to Joe Biden how badly the black community has been treated, I recall their democratic supporters view us that don't fall under their fold, CNN never once condemned or apologized for this at all, but we will not forget!!!

JOE DODGES: Biden Refuses to Answer Whether He Plans on ‘Packing the Sup...
I was curious about something the president said last night. It turns out that Fox News has reported on Biden's law enforcement endorsements.
What does that make Biden? What does that make YOU?
Biden is not now, and has never been, a Progressive. He’s proud of that. It’s exactly the reason the DNC shoved him to ‘the head of the class’ bc Bernie, a proud Progressive, was kicking Biden’s, the heir apparent’s, ass. I’m voting for Biden but I’d vote for a rock over Trump
At all!!! Biden literally kept referring to ALL black people as “African American.” That just shows that he does not care about the authenticity of our people. Trump wouldn’t even acknowledge white supremacy.
But at the same time , watching the debate was pointless. As soon as I cut it on , Trump was talking about Biden’s son. I cut it off immediately. Trump’s verbal battle tactic ruins every conversation and debate. I’m not watching a Yo Mama battle bruh. #BidenIn5
i wish he would have asked Biden about BLM and Antifa. They are afterall the ones tearing up dem cities.
Your Biden did not show a whole lot of class either. Plus Biden blatantly lied on Green new Deal and badmouthing the military.
fact check on CNN...that is funny. What stood out for me is Biden lied about bad mouthing the military and the green new deal. Those were blatant lies. Plus, i find it very concerning that biden inc is getting millions from overseas.
Kelo is an anti trumper. He has no facts , he just hates the guy. Meanwhile, Biden Inc is raking in millions from other countries for what? scary thought.

Not a sign on a weakness for Biden but a lil entertainment for the rest of us.
not to vote for biden apparently
it baffles me that someone could’ve watched that debate last night on team Biden and still be team Biden. They’re both out of their minds. I felt like I was watching reality tv lmao
i get it dude. Your voting Biden. But, Biden blatantly lied last night on those 2 issues. Just say you dont care, I am voting for biden. I would respect you for that. But, to say biden didnt lie is crazy talk.
Biden should go to jail. Taking bribes from Russia, China and Ukraine is a danger to our country. They are expecting things when they get millions.
I for one cannot vote for a guy that can be bought. Biden INC has collected millions from Russia, China and Ukraine. that is dangerous for our security. Why are they giving the bidens millions? charity??
GunnyJ, your thoughts on Biden family collecting millions from russia, china and ukraine?
Biden said he does not support the green new deal but when you go on his website it clearly says he thinks it will build up the framework of this country
How can anyone think Biden can be a president when the whole time speaking against trump all he could do is stutter and Deny facts being said to him. If joe could save America he should have done it 47 years ago don't you think ?
You need to run instead of Biden.. your our only hope
3 things stood out to me. Biden did bad mouth the military, it is on video. Secondly, his website lists the green new deal which he says he doesnt support. Thirdly, his family getting money from Russia, China and Ukraine is an issue.
Why would CNN give Biden such low numbers?  Would expect them to show at least 90% of their audience.#FakeNews
Me giving the DAD face, trying to get President Trump and Joe Biden to calm down during last night’s very heated Presidential Debate.
Biden lied about Green New Deal. And lied about calling our military people derogatory names. Green New Deal was or is on his website. Him calling out the military in on video. Plus, why wasnt biden asked about denouncing Antifa and BLM ?
i wish they would have asked Biden about the thugs in Antifa and BLM. But of course, Antifa is an idea?
This changed nothing for voters.  But biden clearly lied about son and calling military names.
Biden blatantly lied about calling military people names. If u need video contact me. It's easy to find.
So?  I’m still voting for Trump and you’re still voting for Biden.  The debates did nothing, but this, this petty grade school stuff? This is what got Trump Elected.  He’s the biggest kid in the schoolyard and you all keep playing his games.  Sad
Words spoken most by Biden last night——- ‘not true’ —— and everyone knows that it’s not true simply because Joe said it wasn’t.  All the tapes and wire xfer doc’s are not true, huh Joe? RiGhT!
Chris Wallace!!! President Trump was debating Biden not you!!! Sorry ass barny rubble looking mother fucker!!! Complete sham debate!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I was very impressed he went into it. It's nothing to be ashamed of and would have done the same thing. Let's all be honest with each other! We all have issues. When Biden comes with truth, there is nothing Trump can say. Own it!
It's like a dark political TV show that show writers would balk at as being too farfetched. We have to be better than this and elect people that have ethical and professional standards. Biden is a decent, upstanding civil servant that will so right by this country and its people

From my basement..  Joe Biden says he and Jill Biden tested negative for coronavirus
Who would vote for Biden no matter whot time he gets up ???
Even then you know that the left would be all over people on social media who mocked Biden for it. But its all funny since its Trump. Just pointing out an obvious double standard. We have an election in a month and this is going to be spun so many ways
Wallace was the worse moderator ever. He should be fired for allowing comments made by the idiot Biden without saying something to him.
If it were the other way around and Biden got covid the far right would be mocking him and the left would be talking about how evil they were for wishing death on someone but since its Trump i guess all the jokes are ok. We're in a weird place. I dont wish death on my worst enemy

Does the author of this piece not realize that many of the criticisms he collected contradict each other? Trump is running interference for Biden, and also Trump exerted no control over the debate.
His whole modus operandi is to confuse, depress, and find a way to fatally unnerve his audience  so they don’t realize what is really going on!  He wasn’t going to give Biden a chance to tell us anything.  He is a compulsive liar and needs to be in a psychiatric center.  😱😱😱

Why did Biden keep read “notes” when he Biden spoke. Who wrote, prepared those notes
Why did hunter Biden receive 3.5 million from the wife of a Russian mayor. Russia Russia Russia
Pictures show that Biden had an earpiece, a wire inside his right coat and another device on his left wrist.
You do realize Biden is compromised by his son Hunter in receiving large amounts of money from Russia ,Ukraine and China. Those of us who have had security clearance know the risk. So why didn’t hunter receive a dishonorable discharge for drug use, who interfered.

Biden won
I wish Trump had gone after him more. Still great though. I don't know what meds Biden was on to keep him sharp, but he had something. Just comparing his interviews and his little gatherings he's had something was going on. ☝☝☝
Chris Wallace interrupted the president insisting on answering the questions asked but not of Biden. Does Biden support BLM or not?
If Trump had called Biden a clown you wouldn't hear the end if it.
He has b any times, yet you do not want to hear it. Why has Biden not condemn  Antifa or BLM they are domestic terrorists  groups.
Who y’all think a win in a fair one ? ... trump got weight but Biden look athletic like he hoop with Obama sometimes or something like that ...
Does Biden support BLM or not? Answer the questions for God's sake.
All of his answers are off question. So, does Biden support BLM or not? Answer the question!
Biden said my son 4 times .. i translated that as .. I’ll beat yo mf ass 😭
Joe Biden just brought up his sons past abuse to drugs in a presidential debate?!
Biden wanna fight i feel em trump is out of order lol
Biden &amp; Trump needa just fade dat shit out already 😭
Trump: People should elect me because I perfect in my own mind. Biden: People should elect me because he's bat-shit crazy. #Debates2020
So Biden wants a Psychologist to accompany police officers while on patrol?
His family we can talk about all night - Biden 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We are now 50 min into the debat. It is the time where Biden will fall apart (even more so), and Trump will begin to make even more outlandish statements.
Biden- “Number 2” Trump- “ No you’re number 2”
Biden look like a low key racist
“You’re the worst President america has ever had” yes Biden!!! #itstrue
Joe Biden the white Charles Barkley 😭
Did Donald Trump really just insinuate that Joe Biden is stupid while referencing his college education? Joe Biden double majored in history &amp; political science with a minor in English, and then obtained a law degree. Trump has a bachelors in economics and doesn’t pay taxes.
best part of the debate so far is biden saying “shut up, man”
Biden doesn’t want to social distance at least from women and small girls
Biden's strategy is to appeal the people's common sense compared to Trump doing whatever he's doing.
Holy shit! Trump is a moron thinking he is smarter than Biden!!
Trump trying to explain to Biden how foreign countries conceal information is laughable
Biden is feisty tonight I love it.
Omg! Biden told him to shut up!!!! 😂😂😂
Who is Trump debating? Biden or the moderator?
Biden already struggling to finish a sentence. #Debates2020
Donald, Biden is not against fracking even though both of you should be!

Let's just be clear:  if Joe Biden was hospitalized for COVID-19, Donald Trump would be calling for him to withdraw from the race and mocking him at rallies for being sick.
👇  Joe Biden has had 28 years to apologize to Hill for the foul treatment she received in Senate Judiciary Committee hearings chaired by then-Sen. Biden.
it seems alot of people dont know who the proud boys are. the fact that biden brought them up still seems fishy to me.
Biden visits Michigan, wants 'full recovery' for Trump  And nobody showed up
If it were survival of the fittest, Biden would have been eaten a long time ago.
While we know that the president and first lady have gone into isolation and that initial results from Biden are negative, we don't know a lot about how the White House will function and how the complexion of the race will change between now and Nov. 3.
White Voters Could Cost Trump the Presidency  DEPLORABLE White n Black Voters will NEVER LEAVE TRUMP In Fact WOKE Black voters is OVER 20% Its over Pelosi Biden Harris

Or even the grand plan to drop out as his polling goes lower. Fewer negative ads while he’s quarantined, Biden has no one to debate, and Pence has an excuse to avoid his, too. Meanwhile, the base will worship him even more no matter what.
Wasn’t Trump just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask?
Hes such a terrible individual. George Wallace and Joe Biden in the same breath. At least Wallace was up front about his racism.
You lose when you toss around the out of context stuff. No one takes you seriously because you and I know it’s out of context. It’s equivalent to a jab.  Just like we all know Biden calling the troops bastards is out of context.  Make context great again!
If Trump survives and Biden gets it and dies, will God still be good?  Asking for people that aren’t idiots.
So that’s where Biden got his stupid answer.  FBI director needs step down.
wonder how many people would be dead from COVID if we had open borders like Biden wants🤔
Trump 2020.  Biden’s senile and a cheater with wires for the debate.  He’s a joke of a candidate.
Your daily Election 2020 roundup: Trump sends out aid to key groups; Biden to launch in-person canvassing; the latest polls; scenes from the trail; and more.
Wrong. Makes no sense. So let’s settle for Biden and let him destroy the country. No way u think he would ever run the country. He couldn’t even be out for 30 min without needing to take a nap
O she knows what she did. She was the one that signed off and agreed to start the whole Russia hoax from a Russian agent. She’s the one w Russian ties just like Biden. Called misdirection so people that r morons won’t see the truth
This video about drug addicction was released shortly after her husband and his large adult son were mocking Joe Biden's son for having a drug addiction.  The whole Trump family is garbage.

This, at this point I encourage swing state voters to vote for Biden, but if you live in a deep red or blue state like me, just go ahead and vote your conscience, our votes don't actually matter anyway.
This just in Trump has projected that Biden will cancel next 2 debates. Which we all now know that means Trump will be canceling next 2 debates.  🙄
What the fuck are you talking about. Are you and Joe Biden drinking from the same glass?
And the 15 times he talked with Biden, he gave him the talking points.
Let's understand the left's near term goal. It isnt putting Joe biden in the White House. It's getting the first so called black woman in it. Joe Biden is heading for serenity gardens
Go back and watch old film on Biden &amp; Trump pre Obama era. Watch their mannerisms and diction.
We need to talk more about " invoking the Pac 10 last night.   Biden: Covid, 200,000+ dead.  Trump: I brought back football.
Biden had a wire and a mono lens.  Trump didn’t.  Brainwashed
What about the thousands of troops Obama killed?  Under VP Biden.  Oh, forgot about that huh?
Yea need to give Biden a quiet room so he can hear his prompt...
Wired Biden had the mic.  Lol what a loser...
WHY, wired Biden and his teammate Mike Wallace ran this charade!  Biden did the back talk in the last hour but Mikey hooked him up.
Economy: I got nothing. Coronavirus: I got nothing. Green New Deal: I got nothing. Riots: I got nothing Taxes: I will raise taxes. Basic Plan: Take Money from Americans. Make sure Hunter Biden gets some of the money.
Yes he did. #JoeWired #JoeBiden "Joe Biden did not wear a wire to aid him in the debate, The Associated Press confirms"
Do you remember the economic malaise that characterized the Obama years? There was no hope and no change. How about the way it felt during the Carter years? This is what a vote for Joe Biden gets you.
Will Raise Taxes. Will outlaw coal and fossil fuels.  Will destroy any semblance of an economy we have. But Hunter Biden will profit from it all. Remember, he doesn't work for us.
Well He denied it but..here's the black and white: "Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face."
The Commission on Presidential Debates says it’s adding new “tools to maintain order” to the upcoming debates following the first meeting between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

Joe Biden: No More Coal or Oil Plants in America  via
That's BS. No reasonable person watched that &amp; thought Biden was the let down.  Trump is the diminished one; he's literally projecting all of his weaknesses on Biden.  He's in mental crisis &amp; its sick that the enablers are getting away with this.  Nobody is in charge now  No one.
The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
WHY IS BIDEN SO FUNNY IM SCREAMING
antifa isn’t an organization💀 and biden condemned any violence from protests multiple times during the debate
Anyone else notice last night how Joe Biden’s suit looked like it came from a thrift store
Trump was making good progress combatting the opioid epidemic as recent as last year by expanding treatment options and access to mental health services, so whether it's Trump or Biden next, hopefully they pick right up on the progress we were making
“Almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,” said Trump, whose exchange with Democrat Joe Biden left the extremist group Proud Boys celebrating what some of its members saw as tacit approval. &gt;&gt;

Dawg its absolutely heartbreaking. I definitely realize Biden and Harris do not have a perfect voting track record in this space but A LOT has changed and been learned since then and seeing him stick up for his son like that gave me hope.
Biden can't control Trump? Why should the President need controlling,  Fascism Barbie?
President Trump said the Democratic Party "wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare" and that they would "dominate" Joe Biden. The Democratic nominee responded: "I am the Democratic Party right now." &gt;&gt;

Both sides may some claims that weren't exactly reflective of reality.
I thought this comment looked good for Biden from a presentation standpoint, but we can't forget that Biden has authored multiple bills that locked up millions of addicts for drug use. Not to mention his running mate being notorious for locking up thousands in California for weed
I did too! I've been a life long republican but now independent. Biden gives me hope.
By voting for Joe Biden.
Joe Biden has a stutter. The fact Donald Trump interrupted and cut him off ALL night shows he was trying to make him nervous to make it worse and flop the debate. He could sell it to the media the next day as “Sleepy Joe losing his mind.” Gross
Addiction is a disease and America has a silent issue they don’t want to look at or admit and ppl just want to act like we’re all squeaky clean and anyone who suffers is weak. Trump taking a jab at Biden’s son was extremely shameful and somewhat symbolic of the disconnect.
Biden’s comment last night about his son resonated with me so deeply. As a person with experience looking after family members and friends with addiction and still loving them the same that was such a touching &amp; humble thing to hear. Especially coming from a POLITICIAN.
Watch some highlights from last night's debate at the link! &gt;&gt;
I do not agree 100% with either of the Presidential Candidates, but if Biden wins this country is doomed! Biden will push this country under and that was made clear last night! Biden is not the right President for this country at this time, Trump is!
Also worth noting that act included Biden doing to Paul Ryan what Trump did to him last night. But he’s going to restore decency or something.
After last night,  the polls should be Biden 99% Trump 1%  just his family.
PAY ATTENTION  . That is the people you "represent" calling you a dumpster fire. Wake up man.  #EndTrumpsChaos  #shutupman  #Biden 👊  is the path out of this nightmare.  #ByeFelicia
Why didn’t Chris Wallace question Biden about “White Supremacy, since he said a KKK Grand Wizard was his mentor, that Blacks were predators, and that he didn’t want his kids growing up in a racial jungle so he opposed busing?

Biden can't denounce Antifa because he sees them as his fighters who are taking on the Proud Boys. The fact that Antifa act like actual brownshirts isn't a deal breaker for Biden in the same way Biden looking the other way on Antifa isn't a deal breaker to Biden supporters.
Biden dominated the debate. He talked to the American people. Trump argues with the moderator.
You're not going to scare me into voting for biden by saying it's life or death and we have to "save the country" from trump when there are literally no fundamental differences between the two to me. I don't care who wins or loses. They both fucking suck.
And of course, she forgot (ignored) that Biden indicated Antifa was "an idea, not an organization" People are only concerned about character when it allows them to attack the other tribe. We're definitely in a bad place.
Fuck no. Don't blame that shit on third party voters. Run someone worth voting for and we'll vote for them. But neither Biden or Trump deserves my vote so they aren't getting it. They're both authoritarian pieces of shit. I don't care who wins or loses either way. Just need 5%
The one great thing about the debate is that both Trump and Biden lied shamelessly. The people calling out one but looking the other way on the other will tell you all you need to know about their integrity. It gives you a good idea as to which Twitter follows are actually honest
Pretty solid review by  Everybody Loses, Which Helps Biden
After more than a year of circling each other, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night in Ohio. Here's how things went.
Chris Wallace, you caused the chaos with your biased questioning and interrupting of the President. You never interrupted Biden! You’re a disgrace to journalism as any member of CNN.  The American people want fairness.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden sparred Tuesday in their first of three debates leading up to the Nov. 3 election. Here's a look at how their statements stacked up with the facts.
God u have no clue how the real world works. I would have done the same thing. It’s called  write offs and our tax code that Biden wrote.
You are ill. Biden won by not losing. Trump gained nothing by his hideous performance.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden met Tuesday night for the first of three presidential debates.
Biden by a landslide
The biggest difference? Trump argued with the moderator. Biden spoke to the American people.
Your blind.  Biden’s a punk
More like the opposite.  Wallace gave the answers to Biden.  Pathetic
President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night. Here's how the event played out online.
The first presidential debate of the 2020 general election is in the books. President Donald Trump VS. former Vice President Joe Biden. Did you watch?   Comments will be monitored, but we want to hear from you Wiregrass.. What were your initial thoughts?
Trump, and Biden was on adderall
That was delightful. Now, Trump &amp; Biden go backstage for cocktails and more friendly banter. #Debates2020
Never stopped Biden from interrupting
Temporary contractor threw Trump mail-in ballots in trash, Pennsylvania county officials say - ABC News Another fact that Biden denies!
I’m riding with Biden!!!!  #PresidentialDebate2020 #OperationGetTrumpOut
Can’t believe Trump said nobody would show up to Biden rallies as if holding 20,000 person rallies is even remotely a good idea during a pandemic. What a fucking stupid point 😭
Joe Biden called American servicemembers "stupid bastards." He must apol...  via  Joe said play it so make sure you do and share it! He is a lying scum bag!
Do you ever shut up?! Like you live on twitter lol. I’d be more worried about how orange you are next to Biden lol
Biden is winning
Lincoln - A House divided will not stand.  JFK - Ask not what your country can do for you; rather, ask what you can do for your country.  Biden - Will you shut up, man?
Biden says we have become weaker and sicker, he looks like a corpse up there tonight!
I was worried at the beginning. I thought Trump was doing well. Now, for the last hour Biden has dominated.
Have you shouted out to Biden about why his family is accepting money from Russia?
Im in favor of law, you follwing it.   Joe Biden.   Boom.
When Biden talks directly to the American people,  that's effective.
Youre the worst president America has ever had.   Joe Biden.   Boom!!!!
The moderator for this debate is definitely democrat. Trump said “I guess I’m debating you, not Biden.” 😂 They can’t even finish a sentence without interrupting each other. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Really? u just named the states that were won last election. Wow. Douchebag. Can’t remember what was the last election outcome again? I’m caking it now Biden doesn’t win more than 5 states.
I said“when”meaning I’m predicting obviously.There have already been numerous stories by the media on bs mailins If u can’t see how last 6 months has transpired to accept mail in voting then u r just lyin to urself.Only way Biden wins is from mail in votes not casted by the voter
Veterans/Veteran Families United against piece of shit JOE BIDEN!  #BidenCrimeFamily
So u want Biden? 😂 o please do explain how the dementia patient will help our country?
Hate to break it to you. Trump won’t be leaving I seriously doubt Biden wins more than 5 states
Because voting Biden would be even dumber
Who rigged it, ya hack???? Joe Biden, Congress, and Mullah Obama signed it into law!!! #crackabook
🤣😂 yea right. Keep dreaming. Trump is going to completely demolish Biden. The stage is his and he knows it. Biden stands no chance unless dems chest their way in the White House
Seriously. U r disturbed. Trump is going to crush Biden. Earpiece goes both ways?!? U make zero sense. He is doing that so he can show America just how incompetent Biden really is. I’m going to be entertained tonight as Biden is completely manhandled and abused
The real question: Is Trump going to destroy Biden tonight? #Trump2020
Biden doesn’t have any issues to talk about.  All he says is Trump did this and that.  Yea, at least he tries.  47 years of nothing!
The Bidens' returns show the couple paid almost $300,000 in federal taxes in 2019, including almost $288,000 in personal income tax. The Bidens reported taxable income of $944,737. &gt;&gt;

Between those two, will there BE a winner? Trump will just grunt, hoot, and fling poo, and Biden will stand there, pissing his Depends, and wondering where he is.
People putting too much stock in the Joe Biden doing well when he debates against Donald Trump.  Remember that Hillary Clinton moped the floor with Trump &amp; Obama but still didn't get to the White House #Debates2020
That’s great. They need to release 20 years worth as they have done with Trump. Then sit back and be amazed how Biden became a multi millionaire on his paltry gov salary. Where does his and families wealth come from? Hunter knows. Biden knows too. And Kamalala too. 20 years worth

I hope hes in prison in 2024. He'll be 75 in 2024. Younger than joe Biden is right now.
Trump will be fact checked by  1000 times, but his base will eat it up. Biden will be solid but Trump and his capos will state something stupid to falsely accuse him of cognitive decline. An Adderall will shoot out of Trump's nose. Again.
Im not a troll. Not by a damn site. Im just giving an honest opinion. I hate the man. If you were around me, youd know that. I voted for Biden.
Donald Trump and Joe Biden are set to meet Tuesday for their highly anticipated first debate. Here are memorable moments in presidential debate history.
Florida and north Carolina will be to close to call and still counting after 11/3 but Biden will have it. It isn't gonna be close enough for Trump to cheat.
Contrary to popular opinion,  i think itll all be over on election night. I believe Biden will have 270 electoral votes,  when California polls close, because the only thing left to count are mail in ballots,  and Biden will already have the lead in those states.
Here we go again! The polls!   #Remember2016Polls

Trump will run in 2024. Biden beats him in November,  trump settles his legal problems,  and runs in 24.
Don’t wanna vote for Trump? Great! That’s where I am! But don’t pretend that your little defection to Biden is somehow more noble than those who remain loyal to Trump. It’s not. It’s as petty and grievance driven as the sentiment behind Trump.
Anybody else thinks Biden does not show tomorrow night..... surely we cannot be that lucky
So, Mr. West, will you guys on the morning press be discussing that $3.5M wire transfer from a known Putin associate to Hunter Biden? I mean, YOU’RE the news guy at that station?
What a mental case Biden is!
You sure are in love with Hunter Biden. My god.
Whether you're for Trump or Biden, I don't care. I say that to say this, doesn't all the celebrities stating that they're going to leave if Trump is reelected remind you of an upset child? I mean " If i don't get my way I'm going to take my toys and leave!!" type of mentality??
Listen to Bernie because Biden is speechless, as usual.  47 years, nada.
Keep dreaming!  Biden will be taking uppers so he can get on the stage.  Loser
Namenda! Joe Biden is on Namenda! Google it!!!
Where's Hunter Biden?
What a coincidence - NOT! Biden will b a "no show" for the debate.
Hand shake between two of the most tested people in the world. At least Trump is. May be better not to touch Biden’s hands. Way too many cooties there.

I agree!! This is just not right at all! I may not like Biden but I wish him no harm! Biden even had nice words for our President First Lady! Biden supporters need to rethink what they r saying! How would they feel if he had the coronavirus?? This hatred needs to STOP!!

Wonder how many times Joe Biden has publicly denounced domestic terrorist groups like Antifa and BLM??
Joe Biden DID NOT attack Donald Trump in his Michigan speech. That's a perfectly ridiculous LIE.
Look, I don’t support Biden, but I like the move with the ads. No man should be insulted while facing possible death, no matter the circumstances.
Of course not, but Biden is a man of class and integrity, Trump isn’t.
He somehow thinks this makes his classless, tasteless tweet better.  It makes it look worse!  At least Biden had the generally good taste to send good wishes.    I pity people like this.  I never cared for RBG, but I was sorry to see her die.    This man needs serious help.

Biden is pulling out Barack Obama, The Rock, Michael B Jordan, Cindy McCain, George Clooney, Halle Berry, Larry David, Don Cheadle, Stephen Colbert, while Trump pulls out My Pillow Guy and the McCloskeys and it's still a toss up next month.

It is extremely concerning. Biden was among my last choice from the primaries, and I'm not thrilled about him, but compared to what we have now, he'll do.
Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, tested negative for coronavirus on Friday morning.

Thank you Mr. Biden for showing class while many on your side are not...
NBC and "Saturday Night Live" gave viewers a sneak peek on Thursday of actor Jim Carrey suited up as Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
I care if they get sick given their stupidity because I care deeply about the impact on our country and our world.  They exposed Biden and his family. They exposed SCOTUS nominee and Senators and Congresscritters. It is just the latest horrid act by these horrid people.
Get the morning's latest developments on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump testing positive for the coronavirus.
Biden stood on the stage in front of unmasked Trump, his family and staff. This could be an unparalleled disaster for the country and world. Both candidates, scotus nominees, half the Senate. ......
(2/2)—Furthermore, does it not, similarly, seem “fishy” that  has NOT been asked, repeatedly, to denounce #BlackBloc, #Marxists or ANY GROUPS that support and/or promote #Marxism? Even if one wants to claim #ANTIFA’s only an idea, Biden’s never pushed on the above groups
Highly unlikely. Biden wears masks.
Biden not to be outdone though with the courage to fight through dementia. An inspiration to the disabled elderly of our country, nay the world.
I’m not saying u did I’m just asking if u think Biden is too
Also there is video evidence of Biden touching women and children wrong with as well accusations so will u say Biden is a molester or sexist.
Yo, if Biden pulls some liberal "I won't campaign since my opponent can't" bullshit I stg

But ya facts all point that after the medical professionals said we should where one he supported it and that u look like an idiot wearing a mask when ur by ur self witch is what he was saying about Biden. Y don’t u actually watch thing before u get all ur info from twitter.
He made fun of Biden wearing one when he doesn’t need to like somone wearing it in their car by themselves looking like an idiot. Sounds like u didn’t even watch the debate or ur just clouded by ur hate. And like he stated he went off what the medical professionals said
God dammit. How's Biden?   How's Pence?
So... Hope Hicks could potentially have infected both Trump and Biden as she was on site at the debate while infected.
November 3rd only if Trump wins. If Biden wins, it will never end
Neither were Democrats in 2016. I'm voting for Biden but let me be clear, this is hypocritical on our side too. Bottom line is Pubs had control of the Senate, then and now. Voting has consequences. We must vote at all costs to flip the Senate.

John Roberts you asked you question, your question was answered but you kept whining like a crybaby. Why don’t you ask the same question to Biden’s camp regarding BLM and Antifa.  I used to  enjoy seeing you in briefings but I have lost respect for you.
This is why folks are frustrated Bret. He has denounced this over and over again but Chris Wallace or any other reporter has failed to ever ask Joe Biden to condemn Antifa. He said Antifa was an idea which we both know is false. An idea doesn't burn buildings and loot businesses.
Well guess what folks wouldn't' blame the media if you did the same thing to Joe Biden but you didn't. Chris Wallace didn't ask him to denounce Antifa. Fox has never asked Biden to do any of it. He thinks it's an idea. And Trump has deconned it over and over.
It's getting old Jedediah. He has condemned this over and over and are you asking Joe Biden to condemn Antifa. No you are not. You haven't yet. He thinks it's an idea. I guess ideas destroy property and burn buildings in 2020.
He has condemned this stuff over and over and over again. And what point is enough. He shouldn't have to say this every time just to satisfy the media's insistent need. Have you asked Joe Biden to disavow Antifa. No he think's they are an idea.

Neither Warren but especially Bernie was apparently acceptable. Instead, the Dems wound up running the very candidate I believed would be the very worst choice. I’m OK with Harris given options and will, even if here in Alabama it won’t matter for electoral college, vote Biden.
The question is, assuming Biden limps into office and the Senate flips, how those gains will be used. Unfettered, bad faith opposition is guaranteed. If the ‘centristy lifestyle brand feel good but don’t do much for regular folks’ slop continues, get ready for 2022 and 2024 ruin.
Remember Trump shitting on Hunter Biden's struggle with addiction during a nationally televised debate? I do.
Actually its building back up from quarentine "sweetie". Biden wants another 6 month quarentine, which would leave our country in shambles, do some research, and stop being stupid. I appreciate your opinion, and I hope you appreciate mine.   Written with a positive intent

Chris Wallace interrupted Trump 70+ times and Biden only 15 times. Let that sink in. Terrible awful no good moderation.
Within 15 minutes, the interruptions and talking over one another at Tuesday's presidential debate had deteriorated to the point that Biden blurted out, “Will you shut up, man?”
It should be. It was yet another Destroy Trump event. Biden lies every breath. Used contact video screen technology. It was clearly not a debate!
I rather doubt Biden can do another one.
The presidential debate commission says it will soon adopt changes to its format to avoid a repeat of the disjointed first meeting between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
That was deplorable of Trump. He doesn’t “know Hunter” and should keep all the Biden children’s names out of his filthy mouth #DumpTrump2020 #BidenHarris2020

Trump has condemned white supremacist groups before yet he was still asked. Last night. Again. Biden gets a pass.
I just want to see if anyone can give a reason other than "a vote for Jorgensen is a vote for Trump/Biden". No one seems to be able to do that.
Biden wasn’t speaking over Chris but trump wouldn’t shut the fuck up 😩
I was really hoping Joe Biden would say this last night😂
You know Biden used the contact video screen technology last night. Why not report it? His eyes turned from blue to brown last night! Deny this, Biden!😡
I believe Biden used the contact video screen technology. His normally blue eyes were brown last night. Hmmm Hope you have a great day! Needed those 5 margaritas!😂🇺🇸❤️🐘

Funny how biden wasn't asked to condemn the terrorists that have been trashing cities weekly. Ya know. The ones carrying BLM signs and wearing BLM shirts. Odd how that wasn't asked don't ya think?
Biden is against any and all violent protest
“Are you willing to condemn white supremacists?” I’m willing to do that *remembers who he designated as a terrorist organization in his platinum plan* “HOW COULD HE NOT CONDEMN THEM AT THE DEBATE???” Bc unlike Biden he actually gets stuff done where it matters 🤡

Pete, Biden’s eyes are blue, last nite they were brown! He is using a technology called contact video screen! He was wired, could see it thy his shirt and shirt sleeve! Check it out. MSM should report on it.
Look closely at Biden’s eyes here!
Trump was interrupted 76 times, Biden 15!
In my opnion, Trump used the tool of interruption to dominate the conversation similar to Joe againts Paul in 2012.
I saw a video about the technology of using contacts as a video screen. Biden has blue eyes but last night they were brown. Hmmm
And no Biden supporters said “ this mf spittin”
Biden was lying. Sanders programs are in the Dems future.

Biden said it right "SHUT UP MAN"
Ok but the part where Biden called him a clown and then took it back, apologized, and replaced it with "person" as if he had used a deplorable expletive was kind of adorable. The restraint!
Wonder if Biden was checked for a wire under that white shirt?!
That was another destroy Trump thing called a debate. Biden lied and just spouted off everything he has already said. Wallace should be fired. I am voting Trump !!!🇺🇸
Are you gonna call when Biden denounces ANTIFA? Its the same principal, you cant condemn one without condemning the other, unless you support them then you dont wont either of them too.
Reminder: Trump &amp; Biden are not the only two presidential candidates. There is a 3rd option. Vote Libertarian Jo Jorgensen.
Have you looked at Biden’s, and Harris’ for that matter, records about race? Have you seen how many times Biden voted AGAINST any race but his own in his 47 years in public office!?!? If anything they are about even on this talking point in their personal views.
Interesting parallel is the nobody is asking why Biden refused to condemn ANTIFA and said they werent an organization.
Biden was presidential. You have forgotten what that is. Admiring bully tactics is beneath you ( in reference to your earlier reaction tweets).
One black dude said Biden was a joke and I told him his momma was a joke for having him and she should’ve swallowed him 🤦🏽‍♀️.
I was going to vote for  on principle, but after the President's remarks this past week, I feel I have to vote for Biden. Even in Alabama.  Trump needs to see that the popular vote is solidly against him.
How was the look projected by the babbling, frothing, lying, interrupting, bratty clown-baby? Hmmmm? Biden answered while interrupted continuously by a lunatic.
Shared from Photos app 1 video This was my life before COVID-19 KILLED MAGA - And Biden won the presidency in a landslide...….........……………
I knew he wasn’t able to do a debate on his own. He wanted a break every 30 minutes. People actually want this man as our leader?? Trump could run circles around Biden. Everything Trump says comes from the heart. He’s the real deal!! Trump 2020!
He still stammered and stuttered even with the wire. He can’t do anything on his own. Trump is right Biden is a puppet for the Democratic Party. Biden is the liar and dishonest one not Trump.
You’re straight up lying about the undecided voters on CNN. They had 14 undecideds, 6 decided who to vote for and they broke 4-2 for Biden.
Biden saying that sounded like a kid's weak response to getting bullied at school.
Wallace interrupted Trump 35 times and he didn’t interrupt Biden once. And there were some things Biden was saying that were not true. That affects how it comes off.

President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden met on the debate stage Tuesday night. Here's how the event played out online.
Trump has the truth on his side, he just needs to learn how to use it better in a debate format.  He doesn’t like debate prep. It’s understandable.  There were a lot of missed opportunities tonight.   Biden is a weak empty suit.  Knock his ass out next time,
Because there’s a good chance this spiral continues even if Biden wins and is able to take office
I know someone who wasn't asked to condemn actual terrorist organizations.... That would be Biden condemning BLM/Antifa who carry out acts of terrorism weekly.
Biden was never asked to condemn BLM/Antifa. Both domestic terrorist organizations. So yeah the silent majority will be heard... Again. #Trump2020
Friend, I don’t need to watch it again. I know what I saw the first time.  He interrupted many times but it was in defense of himself because of all the lies Biden was telling.  I know you’re against Trump and I’m for Trump. Let’s just leave it at that.

Joe Biden is so incompetent and can’t answer simple questions. He gets flustered and lost when he gets frustrated. His strategy was to attack President Trump and lie in between. That’s all he has. If you don’t see that, you have issues.
Even Chris Wallace called out trump multiple times throughout the night. This is not a “both sides” thing. Biden was largely in control and answering the questions, while trump was incoherent, whiny, and attacking the moderator

Because Biden is a respectful human being.
Dear Everyone !,  Think of what he is doing to us, to our families, our businesses, our Country's HEALTH !.  Trump is a scavenger, he is a clown, as Biden said, he has harmed us far beyond our knowledge!  Do not vote for him, please!!!!

If they knew he had it and he spit in Joe Biden’s mouth on national television Tuesday night in an attempt at infection, I would not have been shocked. why are we still shocked? is anyone giving them the benefit of the doubt? no sympathy. kick his ass Nov 3rd.
That’s why Biden said during the debates that antifa is just an idea but the problem with that is now people who really don’t know what antifa was about, took the name antifa to further their propaganda.
Dont lump us all together.  Look at the Lincoln Project. There are still decent Republicans and they are voting Biden.
I have no respect for Chris Wallace.  He sabotaged Trump in debate with left wing questions especially that he deny White Supremacy when he has done so over &amp; over.  But he did not push Biden on the destructive Antifa as a terrorist group as they are burning our cities &amp; with BLM
You Biden lovers are crack heads.  Wait, we are sounding like the debates. 🤪 Sorry, everyone has an opinion and doing this definitely won’t change someone’s mind on whom to vote for.  Unfortunately I believe both sides benefit when we are divided. Hope you have a good weekend ✌️
David Duke and Richard Spencer have endorsed Biden.  Where is his denouncement of that and of antifa and blm
Biden behaves in a presidential manner.
were you born an idiot or did you develop it over time? The President denounced white supremacy for the thousandth time! Lying idiot!!! Now go ask lying Biden about the real threat, Black Lives Mater&amp; Antifa! Go ahead I know you can do it! Even an idiot can learn.
Let’s talk about how Trump has Covid after making fun of Biden during the debate for wearing a mask all the time
We all knew biden was an impatient top
Prime example of the things I’ve been talking about this week with my students. This is exactly the reaction that this situation deserves, regardless of your political stance. Thank you, Mr. Biden for your appropriate response.
Fuck that noise. No punishing Biden for doing things right, legal, honest and ethical. Why should he suspend his campaign. Onward we go!!!!
So now that #TrumpHasCovid, has anyone tested Biden? They were just at a debate together..
Trumps whole family took off their mask at the debate. Biden needs to be tested.
Is it just me or does this news seems sus #TrumpHasCovid #Trump #Biden #FakeNews #Election2020 #Debate2020
Supporting government programs includes making sure everyone who needs it has it. Doesn’t matter if you’re a republican or democrat, Trump or Biden supporter. Everyone deserves to... eat... and feed their kids...
Stay in there until Joe Biden is President!
Biden is the true racist running for The Presidency.  Go through his entire 48 year career.  His record speaks for itself!
Biden is a klan supporter. Trump is an American supporter. Big fuckin difference.
Hunter Biden isn’t running for President... Now, the question is Who does Trump owe his debt to?
ladies and gents my fiancé has gone from being brainwashed by his conservative family to vote for trump in 2016 to voting for Biden in 2020 can I get a Hell Yeah
John Roberts pitching a fit on tv!!! I’m done with Fox except Tucker, Hannity, and Ingraham.  No one is harping the fact that Joe Biden wouldn’t denounce antifa and blm!!! Fox is not fair and balanced anymore.  OAN!
The irony is this was said in the context of attacking Hunter Biden for exploiting his father’s position.  H Biden was administratively discharged from the military due to a failed drug test while Joe Biden was Vice President. Does anyone think Trump’s sons would even be tested?
Ohhhhhh i cant WAIT til November 4th so i can tell a whole buncha mfrs seek refuge somewhere else when Biden beats the dogshit out of  Take yalls racist, sexist,bigot asses and GO. Don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya!!
Disappointed in #ShepardSmith’s first show tonight. He was heavy handed on the “Trump denouncing White Supremacists” issue with nothing on Biden not denouncing BLM/ANTIFA violence. So far Shepard is no different than the others. I had high hopes.
Not me voting for Biden out of spite bc tr*mp supporters are ticking me off lately. 🥱
On a side note, following Jesus and His ways are the answer to overcoming the issues and problems in the USA, not thinking that President Trump or Joe Biden are going to solve them, because they will absolutely not solve them Vote 🗳 anyway by the Holy Spirit and all will be well
Look, honestly at this point I’m almost ready to call it for Biden. Like after the debates, Trump utterly mishandling corona, and etc. I don’t know if there’s a way Trump can come back. Like don’t get me wrong, I’m not there yet. But I’m almost there.
You really don’t have to do anything to get Biden voters to wear a mask
Well if those adderall rumors pan out, Biden got it
Dems are all about the dupe... and keep getting away with it. Biden would be lost without handlers... he lost his mask when he folded it up in his notes...#theMorningAfter  #VoteTrump2020ToSaveAmerica
Everyone thought Trump and Biden were so bad, that their Internet pages literally crashed because of the amount of traffic they had. LMAOOOOOO
It won’t stop him from being able to cause chaos for the moderator and Biden
#yanggang if you cant do the right thing and make sure Trump is removed I am unfollowing you like I do Trump supporters. Things hit critical last night. Biden is the only option to beat Trump. You are wasting the vote and letting Trump win. Humanity first is doing whats right!
listen idk if this makes sense to y’all but!!!!  Trump is Dan Scott and Biden is Deb Scott.
Biden being against New Green. Previously thought he was for it, or at least parts.
Chris Wallace is a liberal democrat, it was apparent to me that he was for Joe Biden!
What Did Biden Son Drug Addiction Have To Do With Anything Tho?
Did u not see Biden’s wire under his lapel ??
I know, right? Biden can do nothing but lie.
You should just let him talk President Trump, the more he talks the more idiotic he sounds and looks. Biden definitely had some type of prompter in his ear last night, even the stupid things he said could not have come out of his feeble mind!
seeing people with no shame at all still support this clown baby over the not all there grandpa is truly depressing. I’ll leave with this simple analogy. Supporting trump is like thinking 2+2=5 and Biden would be like 2+2=4 but it took him 10 seconds to get there.
I genuinely feel so bad for Biden. He really does care and this orange is acting like a child.
That was not fair that he was a democrat commentator but you held your own against both of them &amp; I loved your info about how bad the new green deal of theirs would be for America. Biden was acting like We thought a drugged up person would act he couldn’t even stay on point!
President Trump, if there is another debate I think you should just answer the questions of the moderator (and I use that term loosely, CW was clearly biased and helped Biden as often as he could) and let Biden make a fool out of himself.  We, the people, know what a GREAT job...
Wallace with Biden's help
The weird thing is that bc of Trump’s failure to handle Covid she has to do her show from home. She’s definitely never been a victim of Biden.
I don't know how Biden made it through this debate. I wanna yell at the Trump crybaby to shut the hell up. You can't even get a damn word in.
A vote for anyone but Biden is a vote for Trump and the White Supremacist will see it as a win and permission after Trumps statements tonight. You do not want the guilt I have experienced for the last 2 years over voting for Trump.
please tell #YangGang to stand in for Biden. Im seeing to many wasting the vote for you knowing it isnt possible. After tonight we cant waste a single vote. Trump must not win!
Do you want more Trump? Dont waste the vote. Might as well not vote if your wasting it. Its going to be Trump or Biden. Dont be guilty of sitting on the fense. History doesnt favor well with fence sitters.
his son "was" an addict.(cocaine) biden pushed lengthened criminal sentences, particularly for nonwhite users, don't recall his son ever going to jail for drugs tho?? What have i missed?  Now Biden's changed thoughts about jail for drug users? Swish swash confused?
tell me what this is Biden has on his wrist?
What is this biden has on his wrist???
Chris Wallace sabotaged Trump constantly, always gave Biden the leeway to keep lying with all his false narratives.  Biden is the biggest liar &amp; phony in this country.  Trump has done more for this country in 3yrs than Biden did in 47 yrs. shame on Chris Wallace!!
Can we drop trump &amp; Biden off at the nursing home? I’d rather have someone from Gen Z in office. That was embarrassing.
Word of advice...Don't lose your job, pension, retirement, freedom, life, debating with other people about Trump/Biden. Trust me, it's not worth it. #Share
At this moment idc if Biden is bad. I don’t want a white supremacist as president.
#Debate2020 Biden won
It is what it is because you are who you are. ~Joe Biden speaking to Trump about Coronavirus
Biden lost my vote. To weak
Biden lost my vote. He is to weak.
Biden lost my vote tonight. He is weak.
Trump never once addressed the American people directly. He wouldnt look right into the camera and knowledge us. Biden talked to us the people multiple times.  It was a debate between the ego maniac and the man trying to save us from him.  #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden is the “far end” of the left political spectrum?
imagine asking a white person to denonce white people because they’re white 🤔 Almost as bad as getting your black card revoked if you don’t vote for biden
The POTUS set the violent tone for this debate and did not abide by debate protocol. Biden responded in kind at times... but never in the same order of magnitude he received. Tonight's shameful display is firmly on Trump.
I can’t sit and watch two more of these... #Debate2020 #DebateTuesday #Election2020 #shitshow #trump #biden #PresidentialDebate
This is true. Bad moment for Biden.
Trump told Biden that he makes up lies #PresidentialDebate #ManStop
I’m really late to the party. Somehow the debate has managed to become a three man shouting match and Biden talking about emitting methane. We’re in trouble aren’t we?
A vote for Biden is a vote for a “hard job”. #Election2020 #2020PresidentialDebate #debate
He asked Trump to denounce white supremacist but even after it came up did not ask Biden to denounce ANTIFA
Trump insulting Biden’s son is beyond low
Biden can’t say law and order but trump can’t even say white supremacy is bad
Biden showing real restraint by not banging his head on his podium repeatedly. #Debate2020
Chris Wallace is a joke of a moderator and he’s completely babying Joe Biden.  So obvious he’s a liberal. We need Hannity, Ingraham, and Tucker Carlson.  Sick of Chris Wallace being so rude and disrespectful to our President
Omg I’ll never forget when I was on a podcast and one of the host said he thought Biden would stomp trump in the debates and Bernie would be an easy target. I’m now sitting here just sipping my tea looking at them like oh really? #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate
I’m voting for Howie Hawkins, because fuck Biden and Trump.
Chris Wallace is a joke of a moderator.  He’s babysitting joe Biden
Our great President.  But I swear Chris Wallace favors Biden
I'll say Biden wasn't my first choice at all. But hearing them side by side.... Biden kinda makes me proud sometimes. Especially dealing with him.
I’m not on Trump’s side. But go ahead and hit Biden with that crime bill!!!! #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate #debates
I know Biden wants to punch trump in the face 🤣 #bidentrump2020
They’re going to have to cut Trump’s mic in order for Biden to talk. #2020debate #PresidentialDebate
Trump lol #trump #biden #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate
trump and biden need to take they old asses to sleep lmao
Is the President debating with Joe Biden or Chris Wallace??? I am confused
Biden to Trump. Will you shut up man? #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate #Election2020 #Biden #Trump
I hate all three of them at this point , and I’m a Biden voter
Biden going in on covid is making him look real good. Keep it up! #2020debate #Debate2020 #PresidentialDebate #debate
Is  ever going to get to go First? And is the moderator ever going to shut Trump up enough to let him speak?  #PresidentialDebate2020
Omg did Biden just say maybe you should try shooting up with bleach!! Lol 😂 I can’t lol #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020
I watch 2 minutes. Enough time to hear Biden say, “shut up, buddy”. That was enough to get my vote! 😂
Is Biden just going to let Trump call him stupid? Nah. Whoop his ass. #Debates2020 #PresidentialDebate2020
Biden said to shoot up some bleach omg
So Joe Biden thinks all of you Democrats are stupid?
This moderator is allowing Trump to run away will the talking and not letting Biden speak. #PresidentialDebate2020
Joe Biden just told this bitch to get it togetherrrrrrrrrr
“Will you shut up man.” -Joe Biden. This is how all of America feels. #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020
#PresidentialDebate2020 is Biden going to be allowed to speak?
Biden laughing at Trump is gold. Like Trump is acting like a child. Omg.
I’m watching the debates, and I just see Trump and Biden and think about the future... We’re fucked.
Joe Biden put in his good teeth today! 😂 😂 😂 #PresidentialDebate2020 #debate #debates
Watching the debate tonight... 🍿   #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday #Biden #Trump #Election2020 #USA
That's how you kill science. A vote wasted is a vote Biden really needs to defeat Trump. Make no mistake Trump has declaired war on science and that includes the science that will get us to Mars.
Who’s ready the debate tonight?!  #Debates2020 #DebateTuesday #election #election2020 #trump #biden #usa #debate #circus #Democrat #Republican
Honestly, either outcome makes me scared. One makes me scared about the present(Trump) and one makes me worried we’ll get a worse Trump down the line, because we won’t fix anything(Biden). We live in scary times.
The prez took advantage of a tax policy obamy and biden baby came up with...a lot a demo-dummies took advantage at the same time...remember, he’s a businessman, not a politician...CC
Pretty happy with health insurance, which I PAY FOR, so voting Biden but ok
No one can say what good Biden has done or anything good about him all they can do is slam trump with lies.

I am just wondering when we will hear tomorrow that Biden won’t be able to make the debate but Kamala will take his place.
I like  I don’t really care who he endorses. But this is funny I don’t care who you are! #Biden #Trump2020
Well if you want to call it a donation or as the rest of us say giving to the IRS for back taxes, I would say Biden has never had to. CANT WAIT TO SEE YOUR DAD IN A ORANGE JUMP SUIT. LOOSER
All the powers that be will be protecting Biden, even Wallace.
Tomorrow will be must watch TV for the debate. The president has set the bar really low for Biden and I think he will do better than he thinks.
We’ve already discussed this before. Unless you can explain to me how a single vote for Biden will shift 30% of the vote, then it doesn’t matter who I vote for. Love you though
So do these people know who FDR is? Biden is as progressive as him. Now so are the McCain’s. Plz stop comparing yourself to FDR if you don’t even support Medicare4all.
Perhaps you can explain how it matters. Perhaps you can explain how Hunter Biden receives an All-Star appointment when celebrities and politicos always receive all star appointments! Perhaps you can explain how Conda Lisa rice is now on the SEC championship board???
Yes. It is. Because I’ve studied ALL of the information AND Russian propaganda stemming from the Hunter Biden BS! ALL! The PROPAGANDA! It’s just that! It’s the BS that caused trump to be impeached, it’s the stuff of 4 Chan. It’s GARBAGE!
Can't imagine Biden debating anyone. Even though Wallace will toss him softballs &amp; Donna Brazile has probably already gotten the questions to pass along,Trump doesn't have to say a word, just let Joe talk, or interrupt him once &amp; his train of thought will be on the Orient Express
Can't imagine the drugs required for Biden to debate Trump. Methamphetamine may be helpful.  At least it'll keep Biden awake &amp; provide short term remedy to his declining cognitive function.  Trump mentioned drug testing. If roles reversed, MSM would scream for Trump to be tested!
I just saw a Trump ad attacking Biden because he joined conservatives back in the day, you know back before we were irredeemably bankrupt, to try to freeze entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. The sad state of “conservatism” in Trumpland.
All this BS regarding Trump’s taxes yet the media could care less about Biden being owned by foreign nationals.
I just donated $7.50 to Joe Biden.  Joe knows us. #TrumpsAFraud
Now let's see biden and hunter..
Christians should examine their values. Which person/party strongly supports those, we'll refer to them as Judeo-christian values, Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris???  News Flash to Christians: If looking for a perfect man; there's not one alive anywhere!  JESUS -- IS NOT on the ballot.

So disappointed. I didn't think he would support them. Some more of the charities and community work he is involved with is so contradictory to him supporting Biden. Something must b going on.
Durham is protecting all of these corrupt actors in the FBI &amp; DOJ!  He is a dirty judge if he doesn’t rpt about all of the info &amp; release all the documents that have been requested for 3years!  You are carrying water for the Corrupt Democrates such as Hunter Biden &amp; his father!
I have already vote for Biden and Harris !!!
This is a statement from General Michael Flynn and his attorney Sidney Powell to the country.  Please read and be alerted as to the corrupt actions of the government under Obama-Biden Administration and now Judge Sullivan!

I hope not. I want him alive and well when Biden wins.
Joe Biden needs to quaranteen
Suspending negative ads is more than Trump deserves.  He would never show Vice President Biden the same respect!
Whats funny is that I thought trump did his best during the debate on the very first question. Fairly succinct and to the point. Biden can't fill 2 min if he wanted to. Seriously think this would benefit trump, he just cant shut his mouth. I'm a democrat, and hate trump btw.
Billionaire BET Founder Backs Trump, Hasn't 'Heard Anything Coherent' From Biden
Trump’s taking a break from the media to re-emerge a champ for beating the virus before 11/3 &amp; before Biden had a chance to do it.  #Brilliant 😉
FAKE NEWS! You’re afraid of Joe Biden. You’re a snowflake.
No doubt, he would be at a rally screaming this proves Biden is weak, then say "how stupid is Biden, he wore a mask and still got the virus, then get the crowd to chant "mask don't work, masks don't work"
it was between gay cow and LED squid not fucking biden and trump sit down
Christie told The Associated Press on Friday that the last time he was with the president was Tuesday during preparations for his debate with former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland.
Wrong. He was asked to do it, offered to do it and then Wallace and Biden talked over him and changed the subject bc they didn't REALLY want him to do it with so many watching.
Look at this crap.  But Joe Biden thinks these people are just ideas.
I'm afraid, Joe Biden, the only American you will be representing is yourself and your family.  We've already seen it.
Well if he infected Biden.. its not a total loss... good riddance if you ask me.. TRUMP 2020
That would mean he knew tuesday night that he had symptoms and still the MF and his campaign of enablers did not alert the Biden campaign of this fact and danger.  Clearly this attempted murder with depraved indifference.  They knew it is deadly and exposed people anyway!
Chris Wallace Speaks Out, Claims Biden Answered Question On Packing Courts: Here Is What Was Actually Said
Obama, Clinton, Biden, and Harris Wish Trump Well After Diagnosis. While Pelosi and Schumer Use Statements For Political Attacks. Remember Pelosi and Schumer in November. Neither of them deserve to be in leadership roles of any kind. #VoteRepublican
He had to stick to Biden's talking points
I don’t think there will be anymore debates between Trumpf and Biden.
This man is sick in the head &amp; has been for a long time. He's talking about stealing the election &amp; as usual the wimpy Ds come up with this foolishness. Who cares if it sick or not, by now whoever is going to vote for him or Biden isn't going to change their minds. Just vote ppl.
Trump campaign has some nerve to complain about fairness. It's now revealed that Trump had COVID on Wed morning, right after debate on Tues. And did not have the courtesy to notify Biden campaign.
It does have a lot of irony embedded. I guess that means that Presidentis recognized by racist whites that the President isn’t racist and Biden could be?
I think of all those beautiful souls who died all alone, and he didn't give a shit. If Joe Biden were sick, Trump would be out there poking fun about him being sick and still being hateful. I don't care. The GOP gets exactly what they deserved.  Trump took a stupid risk, he lost.
Black Chairman of Proud Boys Speaks Out after Liars Joe Biden and Chris Wallace Call Them White Supremacists  via
Joe Biden has tested negative for being fit for president.
I don't think Trump is going to get any sympathy bump. Biden may get an "I-told-you-so" bump, though.
Biden is the top
Only if they suspend the Barrett nomination. Biden pulls negative ads. Trump campaign says they won’t return the favor. Graham says full steam ahead with SCOTUS even though a majority of Americans want to wait until after the election, but Biden should stop campaigning.
I mean, he attacked Biden for having “the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.”  ??
So fast forward .... if Joe Biden contracts covid-19 as the president ... he shouldn’t receive the best possible care ? The left would go absolutely nuts
This behavior is typical of far-left radicals.They are emboldened to act out now.I hope people will see what kind of civilization we will have in the future when this hatred is rewarded by a socialistic system of government.Joe Biden denies it, but he is just their puppet.
Good cause that dude is a tooooool —he was the one that kept wanting to disgrace Biden. ALSO IF ALL THESE SENATORS ARE POSITIVE THERE GOES AMY!
And what’s more—- it has crossed my mind that Trump could have tested positive  before the debate— but didn’t have symptoms yet so thought he was gonna be fine—and deliberately withheld this info to even his prep team— hoping to infect Biden during the debate when yelling.
There was never an expectation of decency from the Trump campaign. But that’s okay. Remember, “when they go low, we go high.” Be grateful to the Biden/ Harris campaign for taking the high road. It’s what America needs right now.
Thank you for saying this, if Joe had gotten it, Trump would have attacked him relentlessly and today he would have traveled to Wisconsin for a giant superspeader rally where he would have mocked Biden for wearing a mask and still getting the virus.
Is this the same Kung flu?! Is this the same monster who made fun just this past Tuesday about Joe Biden wearing a mask?! #Karma
. Joe Biden is nothing more than a MEAT PUPPET for the new, radical left
Will Trump campaign let up its attack on election to disrupt it and prevent peaceful transfer of power to Biden-Harris? Must Biden side mount all out combat against Trump campaign's attack on the election? #bidencoalition #Biden2020 #BidenHarris2020
So #FoxNews want  to stop campaigning cause that dumb MF sick when all he had to do was wear a mask &amp; social distance but refused to do either. U can’t make this shit up. Biden better keep pushing cause that ignorant MF damn sure wouldn’t stop if it was reversed
If pence gets the republican votes that would have gone to Biden then he can turn around and pardon tRump. This is a scary idea. Pay attention!
Question: tRump is in the hospital. If he cannot perform his duties VP pence steps up. What happens to the election if tRump is still unable to lead? Does pence get the nomination against Biden? Has this been the plan all along?
When Biden gets elected they either wear the freaking mask or stay the fuk home.  They are not the experty, and we have rules/laws to keep people safe. I am tired of their ignorant nonsense...they claim to be pro-life...that's Bullshit, they are pro-death.
1)can't believe this has to be explained to you but the POTUS &amp; First Lady are more important than the millions of people less successful than he is.  Have you considered that if Biden and his former partner hadn't lied to us about what was in their plan, and hadn't lied about...
We’re praying for you to make a full and swift recovery so you can get back on the campaign trail and kick creepy Joe Biden’s ass! God bless you &amp; Melania, Mr President!
And before you say “what racist words?” let’s start with him opposing desegregation and saying that he doesn’t want his children growing up in a racial jungle.
Biden’s racist words should demand far more scrutiny and questioning than anything the current POTUS has said about black people. And yet Acosta and others painting a narrative that expects him to continuously denounce a small group of assholes who hold no power in 2020.

I’ve never voted for Trump, and Biden inappropriately touched women of all ages. That said, something more than “anonymous source says” isn’t much to ask for when formulating opinions. Literally anyone on earth can say “Anonymous source tells me (enter whatever you want here)”
If any one thinks trump would stop his campaign if Biden was ill you got to got bite your self plus I believe he is way worse than they are telling us way worse and one more unrelated thing welcome back Shepard Smith we missed you it not fox we know you will continue to do great
As a conservative I wish they would stop all the negative ads and attacks just for a few days like the Biden team has. I don’t see why this has to be so hard...
imagine what it would be like to have puppet Biden in office and running mate. A horrible night mare.
When Biden is elected will you cry? Or will you be so deluded that you start shooting people?
HE WANTS To KISS BIDEN SO BAD
Just a reminder that Trump mocked Biden last Tuesday night for wearing a mask “all the time” and for not holding large events. Joe, Jill, and his campaign staff are all healthy tonight.
I hope Biden will test himself again in a week or so to be sure but then go back to campaigning. However, it feels pretty safe to say that America likely knows who they're voting for already.
This is what they would say..we told you he is too sick, he's too old, the drugs didn't help at all, see the mask doesn't work bc he wore one and still got it, they would post a video of an old falling &amp; put Biden face on it,&amp; saw something abt Hunter. trump is as low as they get
God protect the First Family and every family that's dealing with this virus" - Joe Biden
Have trump ever thought of anyone but himself? You saw how proudly his family sat at the debate w/o mask while he mocked Biden. And you think he cares about SS agents.
Trump cheated on his wife with a porn star. And had to pay her off. What is it with you people?!  Trump is president, not Hunter Biden. I will be praying for you people.
If Biden is up - and there's good reason to believe he is - isn't now the time to hammer home the positive contrast?
Joe Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said Friday that the Democratic presidential contender will continue to air positive ads
Biden just announced that he contracted syphilis
Biden needs to put all ads back up thus week.
trump is faking it. He finally was told to find a way to get out of ‘debating’ Biden.
Biden will simply forget what he's into
Then I guess they have set the tone for the absence of resptect.  I believe the Biden campaign should hit the asshat with all they have got.
I don’t even have a name for you. Please talk about Pelosi out in China Town, come on down. And Cuomo inviting people to come on to NY. And Biden calling for ceasing the ban on people from China. Karma is a bitch buddy
The  Show: JUST IN: Joe Biden and Wife Dr. Jill Biden Both Test Negative for CoVID-19
I’m just stating what Trump himself leaked out about his prior admission to Walter Reed.  He is not in “bad shape” now.  Just demanding unproven experimental therapy that needs to be carefully observed with back up critical care if side effects
No way. I’m watching Food TV and seeing lots of trump campaign ads bashing Biden. If he dishes it he should get it thrown back at him.
Biden supports unrestricted abortion up until birth. There is nothing crueler than injecting acid or forceps  into a woman's womb and killing an innocent baby.
It’s not Biden’s fault Trump didn’t take any of this seriously and put himself at risk. Biden has been very responsible and he has every right to continue campaigning.
Biden lie? Only when he has the brain cells to form a sentence.
Biden needs to denounce this crappppp from his party. He is the Democratic Party, right?
Official: Biden campaign taking down attack ads
I predict in the event Doug Jones loses his Senate race and Biden wins the presidency Doug Jones will be appointed to the cabinet.
I agree and commend Biden for taking down negative ads. But as someone who had Covid and was unemployed for months do not feel like I need to take the high road. “It is what it is”
Context is key. The main difference is tRUmp didn’t creat those jobs, they were from businesses opening back up. Most went BACK to their jobs. Obama/Biden created new jobs.
Biden has already stopped negative Trump ads. That’s respectful enough &amp; honestly more than Trump deserves.
Yes. Yes because the left believes covid is real and wears masks/social distances. Trump literally made fun of Biden for wearing a mask “everywhere” on national tv and you don’t understand what’s actually happening?! A special kind of stupid.
I think VP Biden sets a tone all should follow.  Thank you, sir.
Fox News doesn't care anything about Biden and the Democrats. Fox News can just get somewhere. They have no power in Biden's campaign.
I wouldn’t tell Zeke anything.   He thinks anyone past age 75 should be put to death.  He’s Joe Biden’s Dr. Death.
Trump said he had a “mini stroke”.  So cardiovascular disease.
ABC just showed all the stupid crap they been doing. You can FOX wouldn't be respectful of Biden
Will Trump campaign let up its attack on the election to disrupt it and prevent peaceful transfer of power to Biden-Harris? Must Biden side continue mounting an all out resistance to the Trump campaign's attack on the election?  #alpolitics #OneAlabama

Biden can say this because he has the one thing Trump lacks.....compassion!
I heard that Biden spit on POTUS and that’s how he contracted the virus.
Would they do that for Biden? Hell No, so Biden presses on.
Since Biden has discontinued negative ads on true, true but negative, then why are they debating.
I find it hard to have any compassion for Trump because the did the debate without advising the Biden campaign that he had been exposed.  He should have immediately gone into quarantine, instead he galumped around spreading virus to the unsuspecting...
Great news for Joe Biden. Let the campaigning continue.
Her account should be SUSPENDED PERMANENTLY, like mine would rightly be if I tweeted this about #Biden. What an evil lowlife. 😡
But Biden said nothing of any substance!  He avoids answering questions!  TRUMP 2020!  🇺🇸
One theological correction. Only the divine can offer grace. Joe Biden offers mercy to others in their moments of struggle.
POTUS took the highest dose of an experimental drug that only 275 people have received. Doesn’t support the idea that he’s experiencing mild symptoms.  Also, all these negative tests, Biden included, aren’t definitive. Virus incubates for up to 5-7 days.
Here’s to 4 more years!  He’s a MUCH better president than Joe Biden ever could be!  🇺🇸
she asked me if i liked biden better and to avoid argument i said “i don’t really care” and she was like “well you should care about who runs our country. and i think trump is the best man for it” like no.
I voted in the Alabama Primary election for a challenger to Donald J. Trump. I now support Joe Biden for President.
500 billion dollar for the African American community 🤔 I’m intrigued, better than what Biden got.
If Trump dies does that mean it will be Kanye vs. Biden in November?
Her account should be SUSPENDED PERMANENTLY, like mine would rightly be if I tweeted this about #Biden.
Man I know first all you are a good person condemn in the president and your own ways is not you. Absolutely Trump is not perfect nobody asked for a perfect president Davis ask for a president a leader that would lead them in the right direction Clayton you know it's not Biden.
Why doesn’t Fox News suspend their propaganda for 14 days? Biden has followed CDC guidelines unlike Trump who is battling Coronavirus!
Why should Biden pay for Trump ignoring reality?
Fox Channel can go Fuk themselves. Trust me, if Biden had gotten COVID Trump would be ramping up his campaign....
No, I believe its just a stupid conspiracy, like most usually are... However, if he bounces back with a clean bill of health quickly enough, it could have an unforseen effect on voter's opinion of Biden, since the media has been running stories worrying about Biden's health today
God please, Let President Trump be alright, his wife and his whole circle of contacts and exposures. Please God. Politics be damn (momentarily). I’m VOTING Biden no matter what. But God, Trump is our President NOW. His health and the State of the Union are at risk.🇺🇸🙏
Biden Said 6,114 Military Service Members Died From Covid. The Real Number Is 7.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. ( -- Biden says Trump's positive test is 'bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously.'
WATCH LIVE: Joe Biden campaigns in Michigan following negative COVID-19 results.
I'm certain that FOX holds absolutely NO sway with Biden and his campaign. If I were Biden, I'd laugh and KIM: Keep It Moving.
But can you vote Biden and say you support school choice? He certainly doesn’t.
Is there anything you won't lie about regarding Biden baloney plans. 40 fn years in government by yeah, next time he's gonna do something different. Yeah, poor old Joe didn't figure climate catastrophe until just now when running for President?
extremely and I could tell Biden got furious but he still managed to keep his cool and I respect him for that but he still sucks
Like i don’t like Biden and I disagree with a lot  of things he’s done and his policies  but that comment from trump at the debate made me empathize like fuck with man. I know he super cocky rn now that he’s tested negative 🤣
It is. And now I am worried for Biden.
He didn't die, or on a ventilator. Besides he was complaining abt Biden being in the basement &amp; now he is campaigning. You just can't please that trump crowd. They will love him to the very end. It's like parents that love their no good for nothing child till the day they die.
As I prayed for the President and First Lady, I prayed for YOU too, Joe and Jill Biden🙏. I thank God with all my heart and soul  that you both tested NEGATIVE  for the CORONAVIRUS. Forge cautiously onward as you have been on the Campaign. #Winning May God bless America.  🇺🇸
Biden Campaign:
No CNN is hurting for viewers the president will be in office another four years, I don’t know but a few people who would vote for Biden, and they far, and few between TRUMP 2020🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏
Trump: Why didn’t you infect Biden too // Covid: His mask is too big
Now do Biden and Antifa. Oh, wait. You can't. So - there you go.
Has anyone heard from Jr Trump today? Has he reflected on his criticism of Biden following the CDC guidelines?
Should have worn a mask.  It’s not Biden’s fault trump got covid.
Biden knows that this is a lie, but like Hillary he believes that Democrat voters are stupid and will believe whatever they tell them. Sadly they are right.
Seriously. Trump has chosen to push dangerous non-mask policies and has made it political. He has belittled Biden &amp; others for being careful. Now he pays the price but Biden reaps the rewards of being prudent.
He’s held mega in person super spreaders when Biden has held responsible remote events.
I agree with liberation, revolution all of that, but we could probably get there faster with Trump out of office. So for RIGHT NOW let’s vote for Biden. Because Trump is way too terrible.
Why on earth would Biden suspend his campaign? Someone please explain.
He mocked Biden for being careful and FOLLOWING CDC guidelines! #NoSympathyForTrump
Welp Biden is healthy
When Trump asked “what do you want me to call them”, it was BIDEN who said “proud boys”. So Trump condemned the name Biden gave him. You seem to have selective hearing
Phil Hartman would’ve made a great Biden.
gen z is too comfortable drooling over biden ,, it’s so weird

That they did not contact the Biden team is despicable and should be scandalized as such.
My conspiracy theories: (1)  they wanted Biden to also get sick so Trump could blame him and say masks do not work and (2) Trump had no intention of telling anyone until he felt ill.

Joe Biden is petty. 😭😭

Biden’s test negative for COVID-19:
I am voting for Doug Jones for US Senate, Joe Biden/Harris for the White House.
Maybe a President Biden in March would have issued a national mask policy and shut the US down so 200,000 people wouldn’t have died
What type of shit question is this? Biden/Harris have modeled safe practices throughout the campaign; I bet y’all will slow down the rhetoric of Biden being in the bunker, right?  Safe practices = less possibility for infection. Trump outright refused to do this, so here we are

#BlestIt Live updates: #Biden tests negative for #coronavirus; tRump experiencing ‘mild symptoms’ after positive test
BREAKING:
WASHINGTON ( -- Campaign says Democratic nominee Joe Biden and wife Jill have tested negative for coronavirus.
Joe Biden would receive "Get well soon Mr. Vice President" from Republican's. Think about that.
The only person who gets a pass for wishing Trump a speedy recovery is Biden, and that's because he has a reputation to uphold of being respectful.
The campaign says Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden have tested negative for coronavirus.
Joe Biden reports that he and Dr. Jill Biden have tested NEGATIVE for #COVID19
tool #chriswallace actually asked Biden is building millions of new houses would "hurt the economy" These mfers are dumb as fuck! Really? Having lots more economic activity including building homes would HURT the economy? Just unforgivably stupid!
AND...the beat goes on. Biden should not suspend his campaign.

It’s unclear if Biden will appear at his scheduled campaign events later in the day.
Trump and staff knew he had been exposed and never told Biden campaign. I am so pissed.  And Biden should not suspend his campaign.
Not surprised, it was heartless, then again Trump &amp; his cohorts don't care about anyone else.  Had they possessed any concern or compassion they would have informed the Biden campaign.  That is why Covid is spreading like wildfire again. Trump/GOP doesn't give a crap about us.
Correct....he and his cohorts have lied so much who believes anything they say.  His illness needs to be confirmed by independent medical professionals.  And Biden should not suspend his campaign...
Biden better TF not. Y’all think if it was reversed he would.
Biden should continue with his campaign....it is not his fault Trump got Covid, We need to keep voters engaged so that we can win in November.
Actually, it is absolutely typical of Biden. If it were me, I’d be pointing out that GOP hadn’t planned to tell anyone until reporters forced their hands. But I’m more petty than Biden seems to be.
No Biden should not suspend. Donnie wouldn’t if it was the other way around. You cannot take the moral high ground when your opponent is as evil as donnie
Think she is just playing nice stay of radar she went against him on mask mandate pissing off every Trumper in this state. So that was a plus. At least we don't have Florida Georgia or Texas's Govnor. Her friend Roy Moore going after her for mask mandate. Riden with Biden
You know rational people don't watch Hannity. Stop trying to preach to the choir and throwing everything back on Biden. Your schtick is about as stale as "But her e-mails" got around August 2016. #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpMeltdown
Why punish Biden for tRump’s stupidity? I pray for his recovery, I do, but he brought this on himself
Trump is faking COVID so he doesn't have to debate Biden anymore
honestly out of all the stuff to come out of 2020 the last thing i would’ve expected to see was a joe biden edit to WAP
Can you imagine the tweets from DJT if Biden tested positive?
Exactly. Trump’s stupidity finally caught up with him in a way that can’t be ignored.  This should have no influence on Biden’s campaign. Biden’s done everything right.
No. I think they should take extra care to make sure they are healthy and to make their events covid safe (i.e. zero direct interaction with public). But McCain suspended his campaign in 2008 and cost himself the election. Biden should stay safe but not flinch

I wonder what the ole dump truck would be saying if President Biden had become ill with COVID instead of him?
If you go on his Web page He has disvowed  The White supremacist, the Ku-Klux Klan.  But what gets me is Joe Biden thinks antifa is an idea not a hate group. Smdh
How is Biden already a more thoughtful President
Former VP Biden's response...
The Republican National Committee chairwoman also now has Covid:
With no trump is Biden still the lesser of two evils? 😂 cuz that’s y’all favorite line
What about Hunter? How much did he pay on all that money made because of his Dad being Vp Joe Biden at the time. Where are Hunter’s Tax Return?
Biden’s marketing team did that on his website haha
There’s no uncertainty here, we are certain that the demonic party is going to loose and loose horribly. We are certain that good will triumph over evil. We are certain that anything you publish is mostly lies. We are certain that joe Biden loves to grope and sniff girls. Facts
Joe Biden did this morning but the fact that many leaders in the world sent best wishes is a message that he is respected in the world unlike what the Dems would have you to believe.
Why the hell would Biden suspend?
. says he's praying for  after positive #COVID-19 test
And get attention off the Debate and Joe Biden all headlines on Trump contracts COVID19
Because you are a class guy and have morals. Biden/Harris2020!!
I just hope he didn’t infect Biden and Wallace.
himself will reportedly be tested for COVID-19 sometime today.
Staying safe? You mean like wearing masks when and where it’s required and not acting like entitled pieces of crap?
Remind me... In the debate, did he mock Biden for wearing a mask all the time? #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpHasCorona I will pray for a quick recovery for them. I also pray for our nation to have wise and empathetic leadership.
No one had anything to do with him getting the virus but himself. He denied it, called it a hoax, mocked mask wearers even Biden during the debate. 200k have died, who better for this to happen to show this virus exist. Now let's see his thoughts on it now. Hope he gets well.
is anyone worried trump is lying and only trying to throw off biden 😟
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden now responding to the president and first lady’s Covid 19 diagnosis...
No, Chris Wallace, you do with your biased questions. Example: Trump, do you denounce white supremacy? Biden: no question about Antifa. Which one has been burning down cities and bullying people minding their own business?
Trump has always condemned White Supremecy, and Biden stupidly calls Antifa an "idea".
If Pres. Trump is not capable of debating Joe Biden on Oct. 22, then the Presidential Commission on Debates should hold a Town Hall with Joe Biden or let Mike Pence stand in for DJT. America wants to view a real debate on policy and proposals. #BidenVsTrump #HarrisVsPence
This headline is a little sensational. We’re not spiraling out of control because Trump has Covid. Many leaders have gotten it. I hope him and the First Lady recover. And I hope we elect Joe Biden has the next president. 😉
And my hope isn’t in Biden winning the election, although I pray he wins. I pray every effort to suppress votes is exposed and defeated. I pray white Christians see Trump for who he really is.
Prayers for  and  and I’m confident they’ll recover. To those making the disgusting reaction comments to this, I hope 45 destroys Biden next month and the Republicans regain complete control of Congress and the White House. #KAG
Byrd renounced his brief membership again and again, tRUmp can’t clearly say he denounces white supremacy even once.
And you was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask....
Because it was a stupid question based on a huge left media lie that he didn’t do it 3 years ago in Charlottesville. When it happens he condemned them and basically Biden and Wallace and the left keep pushing the fake lie now o very 3 years! Biden and crime bill is real travesty!
Hold on 45 got COVID??? after he was up there mocking Biden about wearing his mask????!? Nahhhhh lol 😂
Didn’t he make fun of Biden for wearing a mask?
But he got his little feelings hurt and hasn’t reported that a Socialist  White Supremacist has ENDORSED BIDEN.
🚨Heads up Jim. At least a Socialist White Supremacist had ENDORSED BIDEN.. .your welcome 😊
That means zyou will lose everything because the Market has has hiccups with just the announcement that The President Hss the China virus ! If Biden wins America  Looses.
It bears a lot if importance almost dire concern to all of The People that have any , I mean Any Investments in the Stock Market  or especially for thos that have a 401k retirement Fund ! If Joe Biden wins the Pres. Election ! Your Saving will tank ! The Trump train will stop!!!
Trump's bragged about getting tested daily (this was a couple months ago) but since he's stopped taking it seriously, I doubt he's been tested regularly. Agree that Biden should be taking tests on at least a weekly basis.
Biden stood on the debate stage Tuesday alongside President Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 late Thursday.
Your husband made fun of Biden for wearing a mask! I am sure both of you are taking Hydroxychloroquine!
I do think it is fake news,  He did make fun of Biden for wearing a mask!
not at trump making fun of biden for wearing a mask only to reveal later that he has corona  HELP !/$:)/$/ 😭😭
I'm hoping people are checking in on both the Biden and Trump teams today. Trump was speaking at that debate for 90 minutes without a mask. All of those people are in danger of catching this and spreading it to others.
I hope and pray VP Biden and his wife are OK.

Biden needa tweet sum cuz Trump tweeted that 180 years ago shit being petty lmaoo
Wonder how close he got to Biden. Wonder if Biden might have it.   What if it takes both of them out weeks before the election. I mean, 2020 ain't done yet.
Because he has done it framing 109 times. Why did they not ask Biden about his racist past? Against desegregation and bussing, authored the 94 crime bill, also was against the voting act! His mentor was Robert Byrd KKK grand Dragon
Man made fun of Biden for wearing a mask now look at him
I don’t think the base would turn out for Pence like they would Trump. Biden might lose some republican leaning voters but I think Pence would lose more of the hardcore MAGA folks
Lmfaoooo wasn’t he just picking on Biden for wearing a mask too much 🤡😂
Girl this is a lot........... Joe was just ok contact with Biden two days ago......... he needs to get tested
Wonder if Biden could have been exposed during the first debate..
i hope he didn't give biden corona i hate it here
If they tested positive tonight they were probably carrying two nights ago… Somebody get Joe Biden some zinc and pedialyte or whatever bullshit preventatives people are buying into this week.
The President has COVID. He was just making fun of Biden for wearing a mask. 🤦🏾
Trump was really making fun of Joe Biden for wearing a mask just to end up catching Covid-19 literally TWO days later 🥱
it’s funny how trump has been mocking biden for wearing a mask but now he himself has covid💀
the way he was making fun of biden for wearing a mask a few days ago💀

Joe Biden should disavow Joe Biden.  Don’t miss tomorrow’s podcast.
A gift right here
Trump being a jackass made changes necessary (if he’d shut up, Biden would have looked old and lacking energy) but to change the rules midstream is a terrible idea. I think you just hope that Trump realizes stepping on everyone was a disaster &amp; at least allows moderator to speak!
Sleezy Biden said he was coming for our guns, ask Beto his gun czar
akjakajaak- sis you kept interrupting both biden and the moderator i wouldn’t consider that a win ❤️
Sir, do you really believe that Russia really cares who wins? Why?  Biden’s not been incredibly tough on Russia in any official capacity (neither has Trump).  Surely, someone as smart as you realize that Russia just wants us to doubt the election process, regardless of who wins.
Trump continues to attack Hunter Biden and then his son continues to refer to Hunter as Crackhead Biden- yeah, they should make fun of this phony bullshit. If they respected those with addiction, it would be a different story. PS- if you respond, stay on subject: addiction.
You've got to have a better showing than you did on this passed Tuesday. You came across as whiny and childish. Be specific and straight forward with your answers. Let Biden talk without interrupting him or making faces. Then rebut his statement calmly and confidently with facts.

It's not innate. Biden has run nothing but horrible prez campaigns until this. Clinton was the one with the unique blue collar appeal in the 2008 primaries. She made some very bad strategic choices in 2016 and Biden learned from her mistakes.
In many cases there are posers. However, there isn't enough data to know what percentage is or isn't actually Antifa identifiers.   And you're right, they self identify with the idea of Antifa. It's not an organization. Joe Biden, is correct.
It’s so weird they won’t just run against Biden. It’s not like he’s the perfect Dem candidate.   It’s almost like they can’t figure out how to attack someone who is a straight white Catholic dude.

He has no receipts. He is chasing phantoms, which, coincidentally is the entire gop approach now. The immigrants hated by Trumpers aren't the ones who work at the restaurants they like. The Biden Trump wanted to debate was an online fantasy. The real evil is a fake pedo cabal.

If Joe Biden wins, he will be the first president in the US that supports tax payer abortions, even up to the moment of birth, and possibly even more than that. That is not Pro-Life in any shape or form.
Guess who else is going to get a ass whooping? Your VP is going to get a ass whooping from Kamala Harris, probably far worse than the ass whooping Biden gave you.
Biden can’t back out or he’ll seem weak. Even with the same rules trump just looks like an asshole so eh 🤷‍♂️
You mean all of the blatantly racist things that Biden has said over the years? I agree!
President Donald Trump opposes changing the rules for the remaining two presidential debates against Democrat Joe Biden, but his campaign says he will still attend.
I live in an urban but white majority precinct in Alabama. The closest thing we have to a hipster area by nat'l standards but still an old guard around. Clinton won 61/35 in our precinct in '16. Literally zero signs. 40+ Biden Harris signs today in yards in a 10 block radius.
You know what Trump didn’t say? You ain’t black if you don’t vote for him.
Biden's response to how he felt about the nun making fun of his stutter is heartbreaking. I remember an ESL teacher tell me in middle school to never be ashamed or let myself be put down by others when messing up when speaking English because I'm bilingual. #EH204

You are full of shit....Trump interrupted Biden 128 times during the debate.  I cannot wait to get the GOP out of office and your party to die...because you and Donnie and the other have killed it.  Dems did not do it, it rotted from within with your hate, racist, lies, etc.
Biden DID call him xenophobic
Trump is so far from being a white supremacist.  The guy with the racial problem is Biden.
I honestly never knew about Joe Biden's stutter until reading the article from The Atlantic... Since English is my second language, I sometimes stutter when my brain decides to not remember certain words whether they're in Spanish or English. #EH204
I heard from Biden as many policy statements as he could possibly get in, given all #45’s interruptions.
Dawg what is your target market here 🤣 I hope they bring this up at the next debate so we can here trump and biden finally agree on something smh
First to interrupt was Biden second was Chris Wallace then Trump!
You won the debate based on your zillions of supporters.  You won the debate in spite of Biden lies and no fact-checking by Wallace.
I bet he is! His whole plan was to rattle Biden to make him stutter. But it didnt work.

My prediction is that Biden wins, the GOP doesn't get the spot filled, and Biden gets a "stolen seat" in CA7.
How many times does this president have denounced white supremacy he has done it as far as Charlottesville that I can remember. Enough is enough nobody has pushed Joe Biden on all the racist things he said
He should have already endorsed Biden!
Chris Wallace says post debate Trump started interrupting Biden . According to my recollection it was Biden beginning the interruptions and name calling ? Fact check? What was your observation?  Also Chris was blaming the problems on Trump. It actually was Biden-Wallace against T
Joe Biden named them. Trump got the name from him. Do your research.
are you hearing this? Do you know who this is and are you ready to make arrests? He promises a war if Biden wins...is this not terrorism?
PANTS ON FIRE!!!!!
Bill Hemmer you destroyed your credibility by letting Wallace blame this on Trump. Wallace and Biden we’re disgraceful
I wish Joe Biden had responded to DJT’s side comments/interruptions “You lost the left-wing of the Democratic Party...” with “I can loose a few on the left &amp; replace them with moderate Republicans.” #RVAT2020 #LincolnProject
How did you make this whole dumb meme and not even remember to put Biden on the train? 🤦🏼‍♀️
That's great but Trump isnt going to lose. Biden is worse candidate than Hillary. Trump is going to win in a landslide.
Trump doesn’t listen to Biden’s BS same as Congress’s BS. Nominate a candidate with some spine. Washington DC is the train wreck. Sorry, not sorry for the angry conductor!
John Roberts, if you had any backbone you would tell everyone that Trump has never supported white supremacy and his actions for minorities has proven it.  Did Biden ever back white supremacist or do any to hurt black persons? I say yes.
I agree with Joy, wholeheartedly.   Joe Biden  does not have to prove himself anymore, he's  running against an IDIOT.
No Fox sucks now! We have heard out President condemn this over&amp; over! When r u idiots going to get Biden to condemn supremacy! Bye bye!
Exactly. This is not a “both sides” question. Did Biden interrupt occasionally? Yeah, he did. Was it even close to the nasty, non-stop, lie-filled firehose blasts from Trump’s mouth? Nope. It wasn’t even close.

FACT CHECK: Biden Claims During the Debate that Fauci Did Not Flip-Flop On Masks
That's funny, people seem to be wearing heavy winter clothing today. Considering it is almost 70 degrees in Chicago today. ABC Propganda news busted again. No one is voting for a Pedo like Biden.
"That debate was terr..." mute "I swear if Biden..." mute "What Trump doesn't unders" mute
Lol! Right because we’ve seen that Biden is a great speaker.
You didn't win, because you interrupted Biden 128 times and didn't follow the rules.
In what world would bernie be the captain of the "biden express"?? It just doesn't make sense
I think your faulting the wrong person. You don’t see how much the President is compromising our national security. There are 70 REPUBLICAN former National Security Officials who have come out for Biden.  They know more than you.  Get smart and vote smart
Probably not a good idea, Biden’s poll numbers would drop as fast as the ratings.
Yet won’t ask Biden about giving last words at the KKK grand poo pa’s funeral
Wrong as usual. Watch the first 5 minutes of the debate. It was Joe Biden that was talking over The PRESIDENT. He started it, Trump finished it. And who had to resort to name calling? Your loser!!
Trump is winning the voter registration battle against Biden in key states
The way Biden carrying himself cause of Trumps antics is really starting to piss me off.
Did you watch the debate? Biden brought up Proud Boys. Watch the clip vs getting your facts from far leaning left outlets. I am a Republican but I refuse to get all my info from Fox. It’s what’s wrong w/ this country.
Would love it if whoever it is that Biden picks as his attorney general brought in the SPLC to help evaluate and address all these hate groups and militias.
Veteran Who Voted For Trump Now Backs Biden After Wife Dies Of COVID-19  via
I have no idea.  Humane Society likes her though.    FWIW, I do get the subtlety of the tweet.
Is that all everyone can say for Biden? He’s empathetic? Man, I don’t need him to be empathetic for me. I have family and friends for that! I need a president to watch borders, defend the nation...you know BIG stuff!
I don’t think Chris Wallace should lose his job. But the bias and deliberate softballs thrown to Biden are impressions many in both sides have voiced. Train wreck.
It is way past time to end the Trump administration, the era of evil, the white supremacist Minority “power” façade. Trump supporters represent less than one out of five Americans. We the people must prevail and run this country. vote Biden/Harris, America!
Powerful ad from Joe Biden's team. Thanks, JackBear!
That is the problem the RNC is a petulant at Baby Trump is and hence the reason we need to vote their ignorant failed asses out of office.  I don't believe Biden should participate since Trump follows no rules ever!
Still can't get over how much the debate in some ways resembled an appellate argument gone badly awry, &amp; how well Biden did at end gathering himself--despite taking on personal insults lawyers happily never get at OAs--&amp; delivering an effective close. #appellatetwitter
Spencer can't take "hell no" for an answer?   Biden Campaign responded back August calling Spencer "absolutely repugnant and "your support is 10,000% percent unwelcome here."
Is this because your husband denigrated Joe Biden’s son in worldwide television. Too late Mel! He made a global disgrace of himself.
Also wanna point out how at the end of the debate, the Trumps looked like business partners and the Biden’s looked like an actual married couple. Old news tho
But wait, does that then mean that Biden needs to denounce white supremacists since he’s been endorsed by Richard Spencer?
Joe Biden: if you don’t vote for me you ain’t black!  Donald Trump: if you don’t vote for me I got shooters waiting!  Which side you’re on?
He didn’t even bring up “proud boys” “you ain’t black” Biden did.
I can't focus on her because what she is talking about is just the opposite of how her husband attacked Joe Biden on his son addiction. She is who he is.
Omg! Fox reporting is horrible. Now they r pushing h not condemning white supremacy! What about Biden! He supported senator Byrd! He hadn’t denied anyone if these supremacy groups!
Seriously. How many times does  have to answer this? When will u ask Biden to condemn Antifa&amp; senator Byrd! U r horrible&amp; ur liberal colors are shining bright! We see who is doing the burning! And the white supremacy man in Charlottesville in supporting Biden!
Payments were made to an investment firm, from a person that Trump himself has known for a long time. Not saying it was a setup to try to make Hunter Biden look bad, but that's certainly what it looks like to me.

Dear Mainstream News Media;  can one of you please inquire about the money Hunter Biden took from China,  Ukraine and others?

im convinced that girls are saying they want to fuck biden to seem different
Ah, looking at numbers and then spinning the result.  You lost, because you didn't debate.  Chris wallace treated you like the child you are.  Biden showed what presidential is.  #liarinchief
4 of those voters said they would vote for Joe Biden. 2 said they would vote for Trump. Be better.
PROOF Joe Biden CHEΛTED in Debate with Donald Trump ??  via
i don’t think that’s how it works- but yes biden 2020 🙏🏽
The Dems should use the hearings to fill SCOTUS vacancy to relitigate the wrongs and impeachable offenses committed by Trump during the past 3-1/2 years. #alpolitics #OneAlabama #alsen #bidencoalition #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica #Biden #BidenHarris2020
3X he interrupted during Trumps 1st rebuttal. Right out of the gate. That ignited the  fire! And Biden was the bully name caller (to the President!) no respect. Bad example for children.
Bruh Biden rlly scared to look trump in the eye

So disappointing the show you put on Tuesday night. Biden interrupted Trump first and then went on to interrupt him 3-1 more times. DO NOT BLAME THIS ON TRUMP Make Biden answer the question and ask him about his racial statements. He actually says things  bad
Spot on, it's the ultimate double bluff, Biden is an obvious patsy candidate and Trump's got the military prepared to 'thank' his voters with a vaccine once elected
Huh. I wonder which reporter will demand Biden respond?

“joe biden used to ride motorcycles”
Imagine if during the debate after trump mentioned Biden’s kids Biden slowly walked up to trump, got nose to nose with him and whispered “if you ever talk about my kids again I’ll beat your ass in front of our nation”.. imagine. Biden would win by a landslide in the polls.
That it takes 60 votes to pass legislation but only 51 votes to vote to allow 51 votes to pass legislation in the senate is really the only argument I need for dissolving the whole institution.
You are high and delusional. Every poll shows Trump losing support and Biden gaining it. Dream on kid.
Joe Biden lies the MSM or debate moderators will never ask him about.
