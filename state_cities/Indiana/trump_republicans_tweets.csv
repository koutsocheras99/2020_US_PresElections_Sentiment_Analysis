Another sign of a weakened campaign. Trumps retreating to Texas, he's lost the strategic initiative in the campaign, and is reduced to reacting to poor polling numbers. The Trump campaign is seemingly in full retreat. A welcome sign.
Do we have to wait seven years for you to ask about Putin's bounties on our troops? You are too afraid of getting a mean tweet from Trump. Stand up for our troops or let someone else take charge.
I think Trump should tell his people to vote after the 3rd!  Or, delay the election until next Summer:  20th Amendment, Section 1. The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January....  Welcome President Pelosi!!!!!
I don't know if replacing him with Pence helps any. Pence has absolutely no charisma, and Trump would have a serious amount of voters that would be so infuriated at the replacement that they just wouldn't vote.
Is this real?
Over the past 20 years there‚Äôs been .00006% cases of fraud in all mail-in ballots cast in presidential elections. Trump wants to delay the election because he knows he has a .00006% chance of winning.  Quit enabling him, Liz! Btw, do you mail in your ballot? I do.
You complete fool! You don‚Äôt even have the courage to say what this man died of, Covid. Trump, you have his blood on your hands all over your ego, dishonesty and inability to lead. Shame on you because all who have died as a result of your ineptitude and lack of empathy.

Exactly. People aren't necessarily fired up to vote for Joe Biden, but they're going to crawl over broken glass to vote AGAINST Trump, so it doesn't really matter that Biden isn't as energizing as other candidates.
Are you so dumb that you do not understand the difference between absentee ballots and mail in ballots? You never let this guy answer anything that you accuse him of. Just another bad Democrat. Trump 2020

The polls are nothing but crap. Most of us keep quiet. We know that our lives get in danger or our livelihood gets in danger if we publicly announce our support for Trump.
Here‚Äôs a clue. It‚Äôs not working. Trump 2020.
Of course, Cleveland was elected President the first-time, won the popular vote and lost the popular vote the second time and then got elected President again the third time.  I could see Trump trying to run again, but I don't think he'd have the same success.
Kamala killing babies is not getting Americans anywhere but hell . Vote for the one who supports life ! Vote for the man who the Americans trust! Vote Trump

Helpful tip for voting: Don‚Äôt think of it as voting for Biden, think of it as voting out Trump :)
He has to be in the same stupid cibe as Trump!

Biden has to be considered a heavy favorite right now. 100 days left. Trump is running out of time to turn things around.
Pollsters are also so paranoid after 2016 that it makes it easy to ignore a simple truth: Biden is leading Trump in swing states by large margins and he should be considered the heavy favorite as of right now.
Believe the polls all you want. #1 they are easily manipulated. #2, you have no idea how many of us are Trump supporters that will definitely go to the polls and pull that lever for him. We know that you liberals try to kill us so, we just remain silent.

That's why Trump will get re elected  mark my word
Oh horseshit. The protests were winding down before Trump sent his goons in.I completely disagree. Certainly not the APists I know, talk to, and read. There's awareness that the electoral college isn't representative, sure. Much less that Trump was going to actively try to destroy American democracy and been helped in that project by an entire party.
President Trump, why isn‚Äôt there a system where we can vote through the DMV with our license or ID# that will verify us as an US Citizen. Once we vote through the online system, it should be counted and we should not be able to vote again. #cartisfull, #votehasakreadybeencounted

I see stuff like this from CP/IR folks all the time. Not so often from AP.
Again, it's not about prediction per se, altho it's not like Trump was secretive about any of his ambitions: Pr(DJT would try to undermine US democracy) = 1.   It's about having frameworks that are useful for understanding important things that happen, even if it's ex post.
CPists like Levitsky and Ziblatt can write a book on Trump's authoritarianism and publish it about a year after inauguration day. Some REP and APD folks were ready to go too, but I don't know how many APists told us that the institutions would save us. Tons.
If Trump tries to move the election, better believe I‚Äôll be in the streets.
Do he and other Rs really not know? My guess is they‚Äôre either voting for him but don‚Äôt want the backlash from the public. Or they‚Äôre not voting for him and don‚Äôt want the backlash from Trump.
Do you think Trump is in those dozens of Epstein files that are coming out before midnight?

When Trump says he supports absentee voting, please understand that voting by mail, is literally just expanded absentee voting. If you don't see that, you are an idiot.
Why would a multi billionaire give up a life of luxury and give up being loved by all even liberals?  Because the multi billionaire is a true America loving patriot that wanted to save his country.  Thank you for your sacrifice President Donald J. Trump. God Bless You.
Don't give President Donald Trump any ideas about the death camps. After he gets out of office we'll probably learn he did that also.
The left know they don't have a chance in hell of beating President Trump, so this is why they want mail in votes. They want to rig the election because they hate Trump and America that much.

Italy is currently averaging a couple hundred new cases a day. We are at 70,000 a day (and that's after a suspicious leveling off after the Trump Administration ordered states to bypass the CDC and report to HHS instead).
I'm, surprise surprise, with Trump on this. I'm not doing mail in voting because I know it's rigged so Sleepy Creepy Joe will win. Maybe we should wait for the lefties to agree to open everything back up for an election to keep it fair.
I voted for Trump last time because I perceived him to be the lesser of the two evils. Now, it is clear that the second evil was more the media, and less Trump. I will be happily voting Trump and the protection of my rights in November.

Aaaand so it sure seems like CP/IR is (or at least has been) more concerned about Trump's threat to democracy and rule of law than AP.
I've known what Trump is for forty years. I've known what bar is for twenty years. Their stripes haven't changed, they've gotten far more dangerous.
Wow, seriously? Contact the   and  on this story. This is not right. This is Trump using the administration to get rich off a crisis. I'd like to know who owns this private company and are those in administration getting rich off this scheme?
I see a lot of "he's a terrible president". I see a lot less of "he might be the last president".   I see a lot of "why did people vote for Trump?" Not a lot of "the guy who has never had majority support is obviously anti-democratic in a fundamental sense".
I'm not sad, unless perhaps I'm sad Trump and Pence aren't dead from this virus while hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer and die because they want to divide people over their health and this virus.
Yeah, it could just be misperception on the part of, well, a whole lot of non-Americanists. But if AP thinks that Trump is as serious of a threat as CP/IR folks do, then that message isn't being communicated all that effectively.
Trump‚Äôs dereliction of duty has paralyzed the economy.  It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. This economic drop is astounding, and the increased debt will be crippling. #ButHerEmails #Biden2020
I've always believed that Trump views the presidency instrumentally: all policies negotiable so long as he can enrich himself, via explicit corruption as well as partisan-driven sales, while protecting himself from legal accountability. And he's done a whole lot of that.

Multiply for Pr(Trump destroys intl order) and Pr(Trump causes a Depression), all of which IR/CP folks have been screaming about since 2016. It's anecdotal, but I've heard a LOT of AP folks say the institutions will constrain him. Have any CP folks said that? Not many.
Did you know Trump is a mass murderer? Of course it‚Äôs a *Trump virus* and of course it was his decision to shut down the entire economy. Btw the economy has already started the bounce back...more jobs were created in the last month than any other in American history.
The claim is not about "alarm" in a general sense. I know AP folks don't like Trump. The claim is that AP has had less to say about, e.g., the Pr(Trump making/succeeding in an authoritarian play) because AP doesn't study authoritarianism. It's out of sample/in the error term.

60/40 the GOP will call on Trump to resign when the Epstein files unseal.
Funny how we get mad at this but when Hillary paid for a fake Russian dossier from her campaign coffers to obtain fisa warrants to spy on Trump nobody says a word.
To let Trump know.
we call them reactionaries because their ideology isn't forward thinking, it's purely reactive. D messaging is to blame trump for everything (esp covid) so R has to line up in rigid opposition on every point. sounds like i'm being negative on R but

Pretty ironic since they like to roast Cruz about taking heat from trump, at least concerning his wife, I might add.
We should let the Green Party run against Trump this year. That will go extremely well.

The book will offer an insider‚Äôs view on some of the most sensational and politically freighted investigations in modern American history, including into whether the 2016 Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the presidential election.
Seems to me the left doesn‚Äôt want Trump to be partially right about his claims on HCQ months ago.  And I‚Äôm not a big Trump fan either.  Sad we can‚Äôt look at actual science without political goggles
I haven't read Mary Trump's book. We want it to inspire righteous anger. But apparently it evokes only pity.
Oh god Trump is going to be foaming at the mouth over this one
Because the media sensored it.  Claiming it was all fake.  Bullshit.  The left just doesn‚Äôt want Trump to look good claiming HCQ works a couple months ago.  Such political horseshit
So you're saying Trump is a vampire? Already new that considering he hangs around Rudy.
You just can't let it go. Do I need to remind you how many Benghazi's we've had in America, or 9/11's, or that funding was cut by Republicans causing Benghazi? Seriously. Leave it alone, you are only digging Trump further into that hole. By the way, how is Trump's bunker doing?
This is a trick. It's worked for years for Trump. EVERY TIME he lies like this,  look to see what he's trying to distract you from. (recent hits include Roger Stone, Russian bounties, the pandemic, millions out of work and even more facing eviction, etc.)  Don't fall for it.

Wait a minute, you lee right about something. I know crazy. It‚Äôs not a cure. But it sure is more effective than just, y‚Äôknow, dying. But I mean if you want to refuse it since trump said it works, go ahead.
Yeah but here‚Äôs the problem. People like you couldn‚Äôt eat your pride for even a little bit and accept that, o wow, trump was right. And I‚Äôll give you some slack, at first no one knew. But now we do and you still reject it.
And a lady at cnn wrote two articles a few months apart. The first one wa show trump was wrong about HQC, and the second was how he was right lmao. Like it was understandable at first, we didn‚Äôt know. But now we do and they reject it cuz trump was right.
Fighting imperialism by calling Donald Trump "not poggers"
Remember when Mitch began distancing from Trump two weeks ago? That means he already saw the declassified report. And when the timing was right, the MSM dropped the Volume 5 story two weeks after.   That cryptic tweet Warner sent was no coincidence.
Algorithms are very advanced and apparently anti-Trump, who knew.
Mitch distanced from Trump two weeks ago when the IC turned it in.   That Warner tweet was definitely cryptic.
Trump, I love you, but I thought you already made it great?
The treason is what he's afraid of the most. The sex trafficking is the op. The taxes lead to the treason.  Remember when Lawrence O'Donnell had to stand down by the IC from reporting Trump's taxes that are co-signed by Putin because of ongoing CI investigations?
Answer: Trump will be outed as a Russian asset by the IC.

#fuckingmoron Trump reportedly changed his coronavirus messaging after being told new cases were spiking among 'our people' in red states
I think 538 did account for the possibility of a correlated state polling error and thus gave Trump a 1/4-1/3 chance to win. A higher chance would have required _assuming_ that there was a correlated error that benefited Trump.

Yo. A news feed just said the UN ordered Trump to stand down in Portland. Uh oh! Big game time.
Trump for sure didn't read the blurb on the graph, or the graph, before retweeting this
It is so much worse than I imagined. The night Trump won I kept telling myself not to worry because there were safe guards and congress would hold the President accountable. I blame every Republican in the administration, House, and Senate who shirked their responsibilities.

Wake up. That was the Hillary campaign.  It was proven long ago. Trump enjoyed tweaking Obama bc it got under the Deer Leader‚Äôs skin.
If trump tries to suspend the election, it will start a civil war.

Calling the elimination of voter suppression and racial bias in elections "divisive and partisan" is vintage Trump gaslighting. And I'm still trying to figure out how one nurses their own erection. That's some SERIOUS flexibility.
No idea how you went from Obama to Trump. Literally, no idea.
If he had, you would have whined that he had no right to be there. Lewis hates Trump. Not disturbing the setting was actually very adult. Unlike your idiocy
Don't you see why trump is spreading the virus, he's trying to cancel the vote? It‚Äôs Why he has a rogue group kidnapping/beating protestors, he is trying to create everything thing we fear. We must stop him. He is out of control. He is infecting us all!!

Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
This theory is not supported by the religiosity of the Trump base.  Could be that the impulse to idolize politicians comes from the same place that strong religious beliefs come from.
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump should EO voter ID
Yeah let's do that and martial law to end the riots. Go Trump!
I feel like Trump is playing games with us! He's putting so much on our plates and it's so overwhelming. We need to stop and regroup. We need to start a revolt! We need our voices heard! We must make trump resign!!
The importance is what will happen between now and Nov. 3...and more of what will happen between then and Jan 20. Remember, Putin is in Trump‚Äôs ear and brain. These ‚Äòlittle‚Äô phone calls are tutorials from Putin to Trump. #EnemyOfThePeople
Said it before and I'll say it again, Trump is a MASS MURDERER and we need to take measures to protect ourselves!!
In 14 days texas is going to regret allowing trump‚Äôs fundraiser. Lots and lots of dead cult members walking! He better not be allowed in Indiana.
I read early today he was doing better and then boom he's dead. I thought it was fake. I made the call he was going to die since that's how karma works, he let people down. The fundraiser trump had yesterday is going to kill trump!

Just watch how many here will have the virus. This was a very sad event to do in the middle of a pandemic, in the worse hit location in the world! Wtf. Trump just infected a bunch of his cult followers so they can spread it. Why does he not get it??
Which he contracted at Trump‚Äôs failed Tulsa rally. Literally dying to own the Libs.
Don't be like trump and use comments like 'short bus' that degrade people with learning disabilities. If you are going to pretend to be better better and more educated than trump, don't use these kind of hurtful and bully-like comments.

Donald Trump is a great embarrassment to the USA. His response to Covid-19 is a great embarrassment to the USA.   Voting him out is not.
Correct me if i'm wrong but if an election gets delayed doesn't the Speaker of the House become interim president at the end of the incumbent's term?   So Trump wants President Pelosi?
Trump voters tied the fortunes of this country to an incompetent psycho- this is what happened. Eat it.
Is Trump now saying it isn‚Äôt safe to vote?
Trump sees the writing on the wall and is flailing.   Get out and vote and seal the deal to get him out of there.
Please God, I pray Trump kicks a** again. Of course like those who promised to leave the country this is just another lie. The L is for lie.
Trump is the greatest threat to America in its history. Let‚Äôs ship him over to Russia come November so he can practice what he preaches. Vote him out.

Hang on, did you not see all the stuff about Trump's multiple rapes?
Some ppl truly get their news from fox and never hear anything true about Trump. They only ever hear that he's wonderful, or at least he's not perfect but better than any liberal
Barr does what Trump wants including trying (via courts) to get rid of health ins coverage for pre existing conditions DURING A PANDEMIC. Ppl will go bankrupt. Barr is an attorney for Trump, not US citizens. He's worth $20 million, &amp; doesn't care about you or me
Trump is a racist who wants to get rid of the fair housing act. Trump laundered $ for the Russian mob for years. They're killers. Trump has many accusations of rape against him, including at least one 13 yo girl. Trump steals kids from their Hispanic families and sells them

How about some fighter jets to shoot the virus out of the air, or a new FBI building so they can investigate the virus, or some funds to give back to the defense department to replace the money Trump stole for his wall?  Your really looking out for Main Street!
And make sure that when Trump doesn‚Äôt answer a question asked, the next reporter repeats the same question!!
I think it‚Äôs likely to turn off the voters Trump is trying to sway. Yes, suburban (and other) housing policies can and are certainly racist in effect, if not intent, but most modern suburban voters aren‚Äôt going to embrace an overt appeal to racism aimed at them.
It isn't Trump per se but the crowded goons around him. Trump may have piss poor instincts but he is enabled by the crowd around him. He goes where the wind goes. Such a disgrace and embarrassment.
I might have to go back and watch ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù again. Martin Sheen should show Trump how to be a real president.
Trump knew about it and chose to ignore because Daddy Putin can do whatever he wants to our country!! Come on we need this fucker out today!!
1/Corrupt Bigoted Trump: It never ceases to amaze me how open you are about showing your true colors as a white supremacist. I live in the ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù in a wonderfully diverse neighborhood, where we welcome ANY person, no matter what ethnicity...
Because Trump feels he can buy anyone‚Äôs loyalty or blackmail them or publicly shame them or God knows what else... and he can because the Republicans have let him get away with everything. üò°
That is assuming that over half this country isn‚Äôt going to still vote for Trump.  They‚Äôre not investing in engaging new voters.  That means they know they have a lot of votes in the bag.
So what should happen to Barr? He clearly is doing illegal things with Trump and needs to be removed!!
Huh. I‚Äôm still not really sure what #TicTok is. I was told it‚Äôs just another version of Vine, but 2 billion downloads is huge. I‚Äôve read a few articles that disparage the app over data concerns which is never good. Guess I‚Äôll take a look later.
So Trump is disgusting but every NIMBY community (including mine) perpetuates the ongoing problem through local policy and action. How do we push things to change and get past our narrow self interests?

Every Republican should watch this to understand why people on the left see nothing but hypocrisy in Trump‚Äôs handling of different protests. Also remember that most protesters today are against police killing black people while the white protestors wanted to get haircuts

I think there's a lot of pressure to be the "first" in any big position like this. Like, Trump's general disapproval rating means we /probably/ won't see another celebrity populist make it super far for a while
you are absolutely right about everything you just said about Trump.
No...maybe...but it sure the hell is for something that effects Trump. Does he own stock in Kodak?
Yeah, hiding in the basement and refusing to talk. That‚Äôs LEADERSHIP at its best. LOL. To be clear, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. I‚Äôm completely shitting on Biden.
The trump administration doesn‚Äôt have to frame anything. WE HAVE EYES. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Trump haters...you wrong! LOL
Trump‚Äôs administration and his cult followers also spread virus misinformation. #TrumpVirus
They are oblivious because it doesn't fit their #1 agenda to destroy Trump.
You‚Äôre as delusional as crooked Trump and crooked Barr!
Trump is not a medical professional. I repeat, Trump is not a medical professional.
We don‚Äôt need Trump‚Äôs Gestapo terrorizing soccer Moms.
Still can't get over that Trump and Assange look so much alike. Why?
Then either you‚Äôre as evil as they are or mentally ill. These democrats are Saying it‚Äôs a yes or no question but framing an accusation within the question and not allowing him to respond. Trump will win again.
These rioters, terrorists, anarchists, Antifa attacking the Federal Courthouse in Portland need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the Federal laws.  Trump Sending More Federal Officers to Portland Protests  #Newsmax via
Also Donald Trump
Trump already called Govenor Ron.  Ron‚Äôs plan -  no need to wear shoes, raincoats, or evacuate...we have everything under control.
Well Steve you earn the ‚Äúgolden stupid star‚Äù today!  Pretty much everyone in American understood what he was saying except you and Team Trump!  Ask Trump if Finland is still in Russia?
What scientist in the Trump Administration is working on this vaccine?  Check your binder.....nope, nothing there!  No vaccine coming until at least January....then the Federal government will need a plan to distribute....uh oh, that‚Äôs an oxymoron!
He says Trump's tweets make his job impossible then says that he has never read his tweets.
You know damn well you are using the Hitler and Trump philosophy - keep repeating the lies over and over again until the people beleive what your saying!  Not going to happen...Americans are smarter than you and your Dictator!
Why isn‚Äôt Trump speaking out about white supremacists posing as BLM and instigating riots? üßêüßêüßê
Been saying it for a while. Trump is just a patsy for Barr, Pompeo, Pence. Trump is fed whatever bs they want pushed and he‚Äôs to simple to see that it‚Äôs bs. So he pushes it.
You can post all the negative you want about ANY opponent of trump.  I‚Äôll still vote for an ashtray over President opposite.
Disappointing to see that the irony of wearing a mask with ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù branded on it is lost to so many
Republicans know they will be taken down when trump goes. Trump has something on all those fuckers. A good chance a few democrats too. Congress will keep him in office and see the fall of our country to save their ass!!
It does and thanks for pointing out. Took it down cause the last thing I want is any gray area in what anyone thinks I do or do not believe. Fuk Trump. Period.
What if we as a massive group all at once try to manifest the end of trump‚Äôs dictatorship? My spirit guides tell me every day this idea would work!! I don't think we have much time left if we don't do this soon!
If you had that on your ‚ÄúTrump COVID Bingo Card‚Äù....you win!
Does anyone feel like trump‚Äôs misfit army will start shooting people that can't afford their house payment and are being evicted but won‚Äôt leave? I can see that!! Soon enough people will be homeless if Trump continues!! Times are going to be like the great depression coming up!!
HILARIOUS! Donald Trump catches Chris Wallace and Proof Joe Biden wants ...  via
Comparing Trump to Hitler is a conspiratory delusion. If you truly believe it, that speaks to your gullibility, irrationality, and alerts me that you are not worth even attempting to engage in logical conversation with.
If trump retweets, it‚Äôs automatically fake.
Yang's been a lifelong democrat, he hates Trump, and always had nice things to say about Joe personally on the campaign trail. With all those things under consideration, I don't think anything's really out of the ordinary the way Yang tries to support Biden
A presidential candidate has declared that he will force Americans to fund Planned Parenthood. This would undo a litany of reforms put in place by the Trump Administration.   We cannot lose the progress we have made to protect life.
Trump is amplifying this whack job and minimizing Fauci...and people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental fitness? Holy crap!
George Soros and his progressives plan to defeat Trump and usher in his NWO.
Trump has no soul!
Trump's allies are looting and starting fires to make it appear that the protestors are doing it. Trump sent in unidentifiable troops in unmarked SUVs to arrest protestors to intimidate them. That's kidnapping. And the troops are using excessive force, and gassing the protestors
Trump raped a 13 yr old girl. She filed a lawsuit but dropped it due to death threats and intimidation
What do you mean by trending? I've been on FB so I don't understand twitter. Everyday we bitch about Trump being a Fascist, Racist, Pedophile/Rapist, Grifter, Traitor, COWARD, Liar, Cheater, and Gross!
Trump must not have gotten the memo yet, but all of trump‚Äôs buildings will be destroyed after January!
Trump has had 44 accusations of sexual misconduct, including one 13 yo girl
That burns me up. He plays stupid, but we know what trump said to turtle, ‚Äùdo as I say or i‚Äôll leak about your illegal ties to China and Russia and citizens unite‚Äù#turtlesafuckingliartoo
I think they meant to say (sing??) ‚ÄúTHREE women vote for Trump‚Äù
His is a blatantly political statement, confirming what we already knew: that Barr is a repugnant Trump partisan operative and no public servant
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even writing this but I have had several friends comment on ‚Äòthe rapture‚Äô as a reason for re-electing Trump..SMH
150K people are dead and millions are out of work and Trump's priority for the COVID relief bill is $2 BILLION for a new FBI HQ in downtown DC because Trump doesn't want the FBI to move to the suburbs and have the old site redeveloped w/a hotel that will compete with his  No joke
Remember John Cusack‚Äôs Movie Grifters? Do you think that's trump‚Äôs favorite movie?
'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland | US news | The Guardian
Did you ever think trump could find someone like Barr to protect his ass?? Barr and turtle are the only reasons trump is still
Trump is a savage for this, he‚Äôs bouta shake the room
Great.  So Trump's presidency will have to go down as a graphic design flaw.
You need serious mental help if you really think trump is a good president
GOP should be penalized for allowing trump to continue.Citizens should make their lives hell! We need to harass their GOP asses.They are all hiding secrets it's time for them to be exploited by the public . It‚Äôs time info is leaked about all of the players keeping trump in office
These are tried &amp; true tactics by Trump. When someone criticizes him, he frequently offers them a job. That way, they become ensnared in his orbit. Initially he plays nice. But one thing we know is that he is pathologically vengeful. 1/
Congress needs to send in the troops to stop trump‚Äôs killers. For all we know these guys are prisoners and guards and hill-jacks and gun lovers hired to do fucked up evil shit!!? Do something Democrats, no stupid deals under the table with GOP, take them down! What‚Äôs going on??
Suicide if Trump beats Biden.
Well fuck him. Also why can't we use our army against Trump and his group! Let‚Äôs face it the protests are against Trump too, and we need him down so things can change for the better! He's already started a war!!
It's the fear we need to avoid, that's what‚Äôs fueling trump. It gets harder every day to not freak out, but try not to. Enough of us manifesting that he and pence die from the virus could make it come true!!
This BS life we have now in America is ALL on the DemonKKKrats  they could not accept the 2016 elections  they hate TRUMP so bad that they released a virus &amp; are burning down cities to erase his awesome achievements that benefited all Americans  Vote ALL RED &amp; remove the BS
Vandals are playing right into Trump's hand.
Must get a sheet. Paint ‚ÄòTrump has a micro weener‚Äô on it. Hand on USPS building 8 minutes from home. Wait for stormtroopers. Dilemma for Roberts.  I‚Äôve got the time. Micro weener POTUS does not...
President Trump criticized Lewis. Justifiably so.  And because of that, his family is bitter. They didn‚Äôt want him there. The dems would have mocked and blasted him had he attempted to go. He can‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt go.
Don't even know these people! Trump is finished! The world will be a safer place when he is gone.
What entertainer in their right mind would want to be associated with the Trump brand?
please at least offer VP job to  because she is ready to backup your admin, and what better way to right the wrong she experienced when sent in 2016 by  Trump Putin to women worldwide? Say you scared of her, she is who I choose.
I don't get why this is continuing? Please tell me how this is legal? How can Trump be allowed to enforce this? Isn‚Äôt this grounds for termination!!
The good news is the national security adviser meets with Trump every day for updates. At least they are supposed to. Trump has been exposed, if he doesn't get it then yeah aliens have given him the vaccine!
There is a silver lining, someone in that crowd has the virus. Probably more than a few, and my wish is that some droplets flew his way and sometime soon trump is taken to the hospital and is put on a ventilator and placed in a coma and eventually dies!
Reminder: FUCK TRUMP
We all know it‚Äôs Tom Cotton, right? Let‚Äôs not overthink this. A GOP that gets thrashed in November will think the problem was Trump specifically, not white nationalism. Anyway they won‚Äôt lose by much, since they‚Äôll challenge every single absentee ballot.
With the latest polls suggesting that former Vice President Joe Biden has built a commanding lead over President Donald Trump in the 2020 race, investors have begun to take into account that the not-too-distant future could look ver
Exactly what I have been saying about Trump. But he didn't fool me. Can't fool all of the people all of the time.................
There are certainly bigger name celebs who intend to vote for Trump, and you can be sure the campaign reached out to them. That none were willing to stand up for him at the convention is very telling. Nobody wants to take the reputational hit. He's toxic.
I have been waiting for at least 2 weeks for a package to arrive to me from Fishers Indiana.  This may be why- Trump-backed postmaster general plans to slow mail delivery
When she‚Äôs a Trump supporter
So now Trump is listening to an Eagle Scout??? WTFHi Paul, just to clarify, President Obama was elected for and served 2 terms, the maximum allowed by law. He did not run against Trump.
You need to stop with your disingenuous rationalizing and normalization of Trump. Your complicity will follow you the rest of your life if you do not. Truly and absolutely haunting and horrifying.
Aw...shit. Getting tired of seeing folks I respected jump into the Trump Toilet.
Trump's Folly?
‚ÄúTHE CHINA VIRUS‚Äù GO FUCK YOURSELF TRUMP
Your bro crush is really showing. I get it though because, well, based on his good looks he‚Äôs CLEARLY not a Trump. So where is Hunter? Judging on this side by side I‚Äôm guessing he is on his way to a photo shoot.
trump plague!
If trump tries to suspend the election, it will start a civil war.
My fear! My biggest fear is after trump loses he won‚Äôt accept it and refuse to leave!!
COVID from a Trump Rally.........
Well. Biden is losing it. Doesn‚Äôt even know where he is half the time. And obviously I don‚Äôt have to explain Trump
I still find it amazing that after Trump threatened Twitter and social media with an Executive Order that his Twitter account is still up. Were it my company and a President attacked free speech and my company, his account would be done - for good. Sends a strong message.
Herman Cain, though a Republican, is black. Donald Trump knows his base will not take allow him to honor a black man. Therefore he will not honor Herman Cain, but look for him to say something ignorant like "He went to his grave knowing masks caused this"
I'm calling it now. Trump will take Lindsay on a "golf trip" again this weekend and on Monday Lindsay will Tweet "I fully support president Trumps idea of delaying the election."
Kodak was the company who laughed at digital photography and called it a fad and nearly went bankrupt. They will make nothing that will help the country, but they and Trump who invested in Kodak knowing he would make this announcement, just made a tidy fortune.
The importance is what will happen between now and Nov. 3...and more of what will happen between then and Jan 20. Remember, Putin is in Trump‚Äôs ear and brain. These ‚Äòlittle‚Äô phone calls are tutorials from Putin to Trump. #EnemyOfThePeople
It is through Trump‚Äôs incompetence  and egomaniacal personality that Herman Cain, and any other person who has died from being at the Tulsa rally, contracted the virus. #ResignNowTrump
When you watch donald trump just think LIAR!
AG ( I use the term loosely) Barr‚Äôs brow was furrowed and he stumbled over answers about mail in ballots saying he will ‚Äúfollow the law‚Äù meaning he will interpret the law the way Trump wants, as he has done with Article 2 of the Constitution. #TraitorTrump
Rolls of paper towels were distributed to these rich oil execs pictured here to help wipe the unending drool from their mouths as Trump guarantees that the rich get richer on his watch. Yet Republicans ignore all help for Americans during a pandemic he is doing nothing about.
The Trump followers can justify absolutely any horrific behavior or words. I had one troll try to explain to me that Auschwitz was totally understandable because the Jews agreed to get on the trains, they were not forced. I could not hit the Block button quick enough.
Seems like today would be a good day for future president Biden to announce his VP. Take back the narrative and assure us all Nov. 3rd the trump nightmare is over.#NobodyLikesTrump
No. Just like when he ‚ÄúFirebombed‚Äù Michelle Obama‚Äôs vegetable garden shortly after taking the oath of office, POTUS Thin-Skin treating Germany and more specifically, Angela Merkel, with disdain. This is about non-Corrupt leaders saying‚ÄùNO‚Äùto Putin and pissing Trump off.
I want to thank this man for showing that not all of us pastors and theologians are wacked out, give me your money, Trump is Christ reborn wack jobs. Some of us take our faith and God's Word extremely seriously and know it is not to be mocked. Thank you sir!!
By "looking pretty good" she means that its pretty clear Joe Biden is going to walk all over Trump on 11/03/.2020 without any delays in the election. She and her siccophant, mindless, spineless followers all become irrelevant on 11/03/2020 and not a day later!  Buh-bye Laura!!!
Is it coincidence that the day after I write a blog post advocating for voting by mail that Trump is now calling for a delay of the general election?
Trump tweets threats to other countries and Twitter didn‚Äôt do anything about that either...
This isn‚Äôt a competition Mr. Trump. The reality is simply that the Coronavirus is out of control in the US because of your incompetence. The buck stops with you whether you like it or not.
Joe Biden's job will be easy. Just do the absolute opposite of whatever Trump did. We will have national allies again, we will beat this virus together, we will began to have equality for all, corporations will finally pay their share, and we can all sleep again. #Biden2020
Well he and Eric sit down with Golden Books like "See Trump Lose".  Eric sounds out the big words for him.  But his ADHD kicks in after like 2 minutes and then he has to find a women to bully, or a Republican to blackmail, or a felon to free on Fridays. Trumpers gonna Trump.
This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue
Lets not forget that just last week the Head of the Policemens Union backed Trump.  They know more of this is on its way. Please note, there are still very amazing police men and women out there. WE must never forget that.
In a Covid hotspot in Texas, rich Republicans think they are immune to it. These people that end up with Covid and are in a hospital will need to vote by mail, if they are not dead. But Trump says no to mail voting. Hmmm. Is he hurting his own chances? He sure as hell is!!
Take it on TV or it didn't happen.  Same with Trump.
If Trump thought he could make a dime off of it he'd be Tweeting it and buying stock in it right now
All I have to say is that the VP pick is very important this year because trump must be defeated. He must be defeated. We‚Äôve never had a leader who must be defeated.
You‚Äôre just a jerk. Someday, when the democrats and liberals do to this country what they really want to do, you‚Äôll be wishing President Trump was back. Have a nice evening.
That is significant weakening. The remainder will be next if trump gets another term.
Seeing this shit pisses me and most normal Americans off. Trump landslide 2020.
Vote for Trump = Racist
Meanwhile more Americans are lining up for COVID tests.....and others are dying!  Trump going after FOX next for posting fake polls?   is conflicted...sure sign he is in FEAR of losing!
Is he really voting for Trump though?
How about some fighter jets to shoot the virus out of the air, or a new FBI building so they can investigate the virus, or some funds to give back to the defense department to replace the money Trump stole for his wall?  Your really looking out for Main Street!
And make sure that when Trump doesn‚Äôt answer a question asked, the next reporter repeats the same question!!
One of the few Trump statements that PolitiFact rates as ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù
I'm guessing there won't call a winner by Wed, 11/4. There'll be so many absentee ballots to count b/c responsible citizens will socially distancing from home it'll take a good week or so for Donald Trump to get his collective Cobra strike "You're fired" from the American people.
please ask Larry Hogan about statement that he could still be talked into voting for Trump
Does understanding economics include understanding the federal deficit that Trump created?
File one against Trump for sharing false medical information. Hurry though, he is going to be bogged down by legal actions starting in early January!
Going to be sad day for all of these campaign volunteers when Trump is not re-elected!
they will reclaim their sanity if...  Trump wins the House is flipped RED the Senate stays RED Treason trials are finished  then those that remain standing are American Patriots  that is the only chance
Yes, all Americans and the world are painfully aware of the terrible job Trump has done in leading this country through the worse pandemic in 100 years!  Historic failure for the history books!
Troll.  1 follower and a badly creted pic of bad polling number.  Back to your cave troll!! Trump will be by to pick you up soon!  Bug-bye. BLOCKED!!
So very swampy! Trump's campaign pointed out problems in our government, which were real and frustrating to many Americans. However, he had no interest in changing the problems, he just wanted the money to go him and his cohorts.
Hahahah!!! Trump has been in the White House for four years. Why don‚Äôt you try blaming those who‚Äôve been in the government for decades?
‚ÄúNobody like me.‚Äù Everybody hates me. Guess I‚Äôll eat some worms. üé∂  He says it must be his personality. Ah no, mon Fr√®re. Let me count the ways...  'Nobody likes me':
Trump invested in the drug manufacturer. With him, it‚Äôs all about his money.
I lost my mother Friday.   She fought for 8 weeks alone!  We could only see her through a window outside.  She was lonely and scared.   I‚Äôm devastated.  I hate trump for letting this happen.
Past tense Joe...Americans have lost faith!  Looking forward to you waving to Trump as he departs DC!  The economy will make big gains that week off adult beverage sales alone!
Check your binder, under tab ‚ÄúTrump Secret Police‚Äù, what are the talking points?
As a USPS retiree, the Postal Service is not taking in to account the new Postmaster General who is a Trump appointee and donor. Give yourself plenty of time
Sadly Mike you have no credibility..there have been so many lies from you ,Trump and the Administration that most Americans have zero confidence in government! How many more Americans will die before YOU fix testing problems?
It gets better...One of the drugs for which Kodak will make ingredients is hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria medicine that President Trump has promoted as a treatment for COVID-19, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal.
Sure, why not? Just throw that on the pile of lawsuits amassing over there in the "Trump Corner"
And you know Trump is all like "YES! Absolutely! I get you! You are important! Einstein had nothing on you! Get the Nobel people on the line STAT!"
Here Lies (no pun intended) The Body Of  Donald J Trump   If You Sprinkle  When You Tinkle  Livestream on Vimeo And Tweet The Video  P.S. Don‚Äôt forget to tag me and #LiveStreamMyTrumpStream
Donald J Trump! You've just been accused of retweeting misinformation? What will you do now?  "I'm going to Russia World! I'm yuge over there and the peasants there appreciate me bigly. None of this rioting, and they appreciate constant lies from their leaders"
First its to line his own pockets as he owns the fence building company. Why do you think he wanted to build a damned wall around Mexico in the first place? Simply to make money. Like all Trump projects, it is shoddy work and will fall if it ever even gets finished.
Biden and trump both will see the guillotines
The trump administration doesn‚Äôt have to frame anything. WE HAVE EYES. #DemocratsAreDestroyingAmerica
Sad. An earlier article said that Barr and Trump had let on like they would be winding down the Portland "operation" by tonight. I guess that was just more lies. Oh well, the resistance will continue regardless of their lies. And we will catch it all on video as evidence.
It will be you Joe. No one in the current Administration wants the Act to be passed much less named after John Lewis, who Trump could not be bothered to pay respects to. Since he only respects his narcissistic self, he had no respects left to pay. #BidenLandslide2020
As well as nearly EVERY Republican has for many years in the past. Trump put his lackey in charge of the USPS and he has slowed mail delivery to a crawl on purpose. Voter suppression is ALL they have left after the Graffiti Gestapo cost them polling points daily.
Ok so just make him watch the video with Trump saying that about ingesting bleach and just look at him and say - "Resign now. Your humiliated and a failure. Resign or be impeached." And have Jayapal say it!! I'll PAY to watch that. Pretty please!!!!
He clearly admits if Trump tells him to do something, he will do it, no matter how many laws he breaks to do it.
Most of what Joe will be saying in the near future will have these words in it "and reverse Trump's efforts to gut."Joe's entire first 2 years will be undoing what Trump destroyed. But he will have help, both at home, and abroad, as we re-unite and re-emerge as a World Leader.
Turns out, this is the most dangerous hoax in history. I'm talking about Trump, not Covid!
#TrumpVirus kills 150k+ Americans - Trump is clueless and has no plan for Covid - Trump enacts a witch doctor to do voodoo on anyone not supporting him - Even the Gestapo are said to be giving up on Trump - #TrumpMustResign #BarrMustResign
Ahh, so my assumption that Barr is as much of a narcissist as Trump was true all along. Deny, deny, blame everyone else, then claim you never even knew the thing happened. 11/03/2020 - the bell will toll for Trump and Barr.
That is the correct assumption of WW2. But the truth remains, you DID gas totally peaceful protesters so that Trump could get a picture in front of a church he was not welcome in holding a Bible upside down." Your a clown, and that was blasphemous as well as stupid.
Ahem, "After noticing that Trump has lost a grand total of 5 points in all national polls over the past week, we have decided that tear gassing Moms and Veterans is not working so we're taking our ball and going home." MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
Then either you‚Äôre as evil as they are or mentally ill. These democrats are Saying it‚Äôs a yes or no question but framing an accusation within the question and not allowing him to respond. Trump will win again.
What is so hard for trump to understand that all the division and chaos is under his watch!! #TrumpFailure
Are the protesters in Portland playing into Trump's hands?
Trump already called Govenor Ron.  Ron‚Äôs plan -  no need to wear shoes, raincoats, or evacuate...we have everything under control.
Well Steve you earn the ‚Äúgolden stupid star‚Äù today!  Pretty much everyone in American understood what he was saying except you and Team Trump!  Ask Trump if Finland is still in Russia?
Does Trump‚Äôs Syndicate take classes on arrogantly smirking. Barr looks like that little MAGAt who stared down the Native American.
What scientist in the Trump Administration is working on this vaccine?  Check your binder.....nope, nothing there!  No vaccine coming until at least January....then the Federal government will need a plan to distribute....uh oh, that‚Äôs an oxymoron!
You know damn well you are using the Hitler and Trump philosophy - keep repeating the lies over and over again until the people beleive what your saying!  Not going to happen...Americans are smarter than you and your Dictator!
Been saying it for a while. Trump is just a patsy for Barr, Pompeo, Pence. Trump is fed whatever bs they want pushed and he‚Äôs to simple to see that it‚Äôs bs. So he pushes it.
Disappointing to see that the irony of wearing a mask with ‚ÄúTrump 2020‚Äù branded on it is lost to so many
They all feel empowered. As long as they protect Trump, there is a ‚ÄúGet out of Jail Free‚Äù card hot off the press.
It does and thanks for pointing out. Took it down cause the last thing I want is any gray area in what anyone thinks I do or do not believe. Fuk Trump. Period.
If you had that on your ‚ÄúTrump COVID Bingo Card‚Äù....you win!
Darren - If it took sports going away this year to get Trump out of the White House, would you want that to happen???
Aww...can we get  next? #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #TrumpLies #TrumpCrimeFamily
Comparing Trump to Hitler is a conspiratory delusion. If you truly believe it, that speaks to your gullibility, irrationality, and alerts me that you are not worth even attempting to engage in logical conversation with.
The air today smells a lot better. Hmm, I think there is less horseshit in the air.  Anyway this will give Donnie time to get his hydroQ intake since we now know that is the huge platform Trump is now running on - a failed drug sponsored by a witch doctor.
Trump is amplifying this whack job and minimizing Fauci...and people are questioning Biden‚Äôs mental fitness? Holy crap!
Your platform is atrocious. You are not better than trump and that bar is set incredibly low. Clearly the ruling class wont tolerate peaceful revolution, we still need revolution though. Stay armed comrades
Just as nightmarish as trump being president. Both are on the same side
They cannot - they will not .  And that's what I'm saying when asked if my kids will be returning to school - "They cannot and they will not" not until a real expert (not Trump witch doctors) say it is safe to return.
Want to know how much of a narcissist Trump really is? He paid a witch/voodoo doctor from a tribe to make a video saying Hydroxychloroquine is effective. Then he had a website made saying that over 6,000 doctors approved it. All with our tax dollars. Even Facebook killed the ads.
We plan to on 11/03/2029. Biden - 70%  Trump - 30%  with Mothers and veterans. Turns out tear gassing Americans who vote is not a great idea. I‚Äôll tell you this since your campaign manager won‚Äôt.
I have no such fear. He is a narcissistic psychopath and I would add borderline personality disorder to that mix. Ted Bundt is the closest person I‚Äôve ever seen to Trump. Ted was also very close to entering politics as well just off his charisma and his ability to lie.
Perhaps this was foreplay for Epstein, Maxwell, and Trump...I wish her well.
Moms, Veterans, and the Portland Mayor - all conspiring to impose total anarchy and burn this mother to the ground!!!  ü§£HA!!! Whoever runs Fox news took the Trump suggestion and injected bleach directly into their brains. Total buffoons at best. Liars and frauds in reality.
Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.
Mr. Biden is very smart to wait until the final second. It drives Trump batshit crazy not knowing, and it saves whomever he chooses from the immediate media smear that is coming. But I'm with you, I can;t wait to see whom he  chooses.
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even writing this but I have had several friends comment on ‚Äòthe rapture‚Äô as a reason for re-electing Trump..SMH
Abortion to a Pharisaical Evangelical is, in every case, killing another human being. Killing is wrong. So that's what they hang their hat on. Also to Trump, he is not at fault for the Covid deaths: its everyone else BUT him. Republicans are like Teflon, nothing sticks to them
You need serious mental help if you really think trump is a good president
It kind of looks like Epstein trained them. I know Trump and Barr don‚Äôt care, but was she able to shower after the assault?
This BS life we have now in America is ALL on the DemonKKKrats  they could not accept the 2016 elections  they hate TRUMP so bad that they released a virus &amp; are burning down cities to erase his awesome achievements that benefited all Americans  Vote ALL RED &amp; remove the BS
Must get a sheet. Paint ‚ÄòTrump has a micro weener‚Äô on it. Hand on USPS building 8 minutes from home. Wait for stormtroopers. Dilemma for Roberts.  I‚Äôve got the time. Micro weener POTUS does not...
All of life is unfair to a narcissist. Its never them, its always someone else treating them wrong. It is one of the few mental disorders that is not treatable today. Our lesson from Hitler and Trump has to be - never, ever give a narcissist power over a country. Its deadly.
The entire World sees Trump as a loser. #TRUMPLOSING #TRUMPTREASON #TrumpGestapo
After his defeat Trump will blame Pence for Covid response, Barr for the Graffiti Gestapo goons and the Free A Felon Fridays, Birx for giving him bad Covid data. DeVos for the school deaths, the landslide votes against him on the USPS. Narcissist can never be held accountable.
Nah, bro. The democrats must have injected him with the lab made Covid to make Supreme Leader Trump look bad
My guess is this is how Trump will get his next wife after he is no longer in office.  This seems to work for him, even though Americans won't stand for it. Sad.  Soulless. Narcissistic. Incompetent. #BIDENLANDSLIDE2020
President Trump criticized Lewis. Justifiably so.  And because of that, his family is bitter. They didn‚Äôt want him there. The dems would have mocked and blasted him had he attempted to go. He can‚Äôt win. I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt go.
Untrained gestapo goons. Trump spends 61 million on these jokers and refuses to help AMERICANS who need financial help during a pandemic he is also doing nothing about. Trump is a total, complete failure. Soulless. #TRUMPFAILURE #TRUMPGASSESMOMS #TRUMPGASSESVETS
Biden didn‚Äôt give Putin a BJ in Helsinki....Trump did. Case closed.
Dude, Trump tried extortion and got himself impeached. He knows Sinclair, Fox, and OANN will run with any BS he comes up with. He‚Äôs desparate. Easy to see if your heads not buried in the sand.
Trump steals musicians music for his rallies so expect no less from anyone mindlessly following him. He steals taxpayers money for Gestapo goons.  If its ok for him then its ok for them. Remember it was his followers who were drinking bleach because he said it was great.
Good. That means the tribute to Rep. Lewis will be respectful which is what he deserved. Trump isn‚Äôt worthy of attending.
It‚Äôs appropriate that Trump doesn‚Äôt go. He is anti-Civil Rights. Being a man of color, Lewis represented everything that Trump despised. He‚Äôs a racist.
bring me the axe!  #FLOTUSDearest
Good, he wouldn't want you there anyway  #GoodTrouble #TraitorInChief
That's just how ignorant Trump and complicit Republicans are. Trump put a buddy in charge of the USPS and he's purposefully slowing down the mail. That also means IRS will not get their money on time. Trump would screw up a single car funeral.
So what if Trump is responsible for: 150k+ deaths via his inactivity, blatant racism, tear gassing Moms and Vets, freeing felons on Friday nights, spending 160 million on fake police instead of helping jobless.  What flavor is your koolaide and when do the aliens come to save you
We named our restrooms Trump.  We now go "take a Trump" and remind everyone to wipe their "Donalds" when their finished.  ü§£
To honor Donald Trump, Websters dictionary will be replacing the word "fascism" with "Trumpism" on 11/04/2020.  Also his picture will be beside the word "narcissist" so that America never forgets.
May I point out again, for like the thousandth time, that jack booted, contracted, Gestapo idiot is pointing his gun at a woman. Video after video, picture after picture, these small minded "men" abuse women. Their master has taught them well. I have to laugh at "Women 4 Trump"
When she‚Äôs a Trump supporter
The truth of this is that ever since Barr told Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreen Militia‚Äù to gas and shoot protesters  in DC so he could have a  photo-op, Trump has instigated this unrest every night. It will continue til the election, so Trump TV affiliates will have propaganda to show it‚Äôs base.
This Trump ordered untrained, contracted Gestapo took 61 million dollars out of unemployed Americans families. He loses ground daily in the polls because of decisions made by his ego. He is losing and will lose in November. 11/03/2020 - the REAL America returns!!!
Republicans and Trump Supporters - This nurse is NOT a "violet protester" nor a "rioter" but your untrained, power hungry goons tear gassed her. Now justify this all you want but your wrong. Americans will not stand for this. This is unconstitutional-you will be held accountable
In other words, "Trump cannot have the truth revealed before the election."  As if we don't already know that the only entity that lies more consistently than Donald J Trump is Satan himself.
So now Trump is listening to an Eagle Scout??? WTF
And his job tenure will be shortest on record. He is gone after 11/03/2020. President Biden will not stand for it. This goon and all the other complicit people Trump installed with no qualifications or merits.  America will be back from this Trump golf vacation on 11/03/2020
More and more Republicans aren't answering them daily, as Trump lost another .5 points in ALL national polls just yesterday after again gassing more Moms and Veterans in peaceful protests. Trumps tactic of losing poll numbers after ignorant acts of fascism &amp; violence is working.
Translation:What we already knew. When Biden wins, the election will be deemed ‚Äúrigged‚Äù by Trump and his Cult.The ? is, will Trump try to ‚ÄúExecutive Order‚Äùan attempt to overrule our laws,again, and use crook AG Barr to rubber stamp it. Remember, he‚Äôs trying to avoid a prison cell
Do you think Reagan would approve of his name, likeness and accomplishments to be used by the soulless man that Trump is? I don‚Äôt think so!
Even the Reagan Foundation can‚Äôt tolerate being associated with Trump‚Äôs campaign. What does that tell you about how corrupt the Republican Party has gotten under Trump‚Äôs destructive ‚Äúleadership.‚Äù
And of all the face coverings a person could wear, why choose a ‚Äúcrooked cross?‚Äù So, if it‚Äôs not meant to represent Trump‚Äôs racist and anti-Semitic messages, what is the point that you say I missed?
Each section of wall is a metaphor for every Covid death, Mom and Veteran tear gassed, unemployed worker whose relief money was stolen by the rich who got PPP loans, BLM supporters, and just general Americans who will not vote for Trump. In the end, the entire wall will fall.
Why Donald Trump, that's who! From inferior quality walls, to screwing over contractors for years so now no good contractor will work with him, to shoddy plans for Covid, to horrific "gas Moms and Vets" peace plans, to inferior mental acumen. He's got all bases covered!
Trump will be sending in his Secret Police to remove those signs because they are in the right of way!  Probably interrogate the home owners and take a few into custody!  This is Trumps America..just say no!
What policies...where are they documented?  Team Trump Fear Tactics will not work on Americans!
This is Trump‚Äôs America! These people would not demonstrate their hate so prominently if they didn‚Äôt feel supported by Trump and his racist rhetoric.
We knew it was a fake pic because there were black people in it. Showing our previous POTUS‚Äôs standing behind an image of a modern day Al Capone, makes me want to vomit. When I hear Trump‚Äôs name, I immediately think of the Communist Dictators slithering around in the world.
Terrible president‚Äôs foundation tells even worse president to stop lighting his dumpster legacy on fire.
Trump‚Äôs version of America is White Supremacy, nightly riots, and total and complete Corruption. Let‚Äôs hope Tucker‚Äôs right for a change.
I talked to my dad today. He‚Äôs 83 &amp; a lifelong republican. We talked about the mess in Florida (he and mom live in Ft Myers during the winters and Cuyahoga Falls in the summers). He agreed that the governor was an idiot &amp; also said he was done with trump. Way to go dad! Woohooo!
You know people made up God because they are afraid to die. And trump is a crook a racist and a liar. Doo dah oh a doo da day
Staggering how I‚Äôm not there for every... single... trump tweet like those whacko brothers are.. but thanks for playin.
Ok. We believe you, ABC. üëåüèº President Trump will win in a landslide. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #AmericaFirst #BidenIsCorrupt
Staggering how you‚Äôre always right there when trump tweets... minutes apart.. just like your ‚Äúhusband‚Äù always was errrrrr is.
I love it that Biden is leading in Florida. DeSantis has done everything except legally change his last name to Trump to appease his master. Now he owns the largest hotspot of Covid in the US, got caught faking death numbers, can't get rallys or conventions held. WINNING!
But she also ripped up Trump‚Äôs speech, y‚Äôall. Didn‚Äôt that end his presidency?
My Fellow Americans, Donald Trump CHOSE to spend 61 million dollars so that he could attack Moms and Veterans INSTEAD of helping the unemployed during a pandemic. Donald Trump is narcissistic, vindictive, an egomaniac, with no plan to help America. #TRUMPMUSTGO #TRUMPVIRUS
Because when I think of religious values Donald Trump is the first person I think of‚Ä¶
100 days until the wheels of law and order get reved up to prosecute the former POTUS Donald Trump!
Another big talking Trump....start planning your vacation in January when your Daddy is no longer POTUS!
Trump just cancelled his first pitch.
DeSantis is Trump in a cheaper suit!
Im gonna vote third party. Biden helped build the rigged system that allows fascism 2 run rampant. Cant vote for someone who is morally corrupt. I think a vote for either biden or trump is a wasted vote and I personally believe its clear that peaceful revolution wont be tolerated
Pocahontas is seething for power. America knows it‚Äôs the corrupt democrats that have destroyed the economy. We blame China for the virus and racial injustice in 2020 is magnified by the liberals. President Trump will defeat #DementiaJoe
Trump is bating us and stirring the pot behind the scenes. Don't get fooled again!       #Reichstagfire #TrumpGestapo #FacistTrump #Fascism #Resist
It‚Äôs the Trump strategy- magical thinking! Paint a rosy picture of economic growth and control of the virus so that everyone feels good and votes for Trump. Doesn‚Äôt matter that he and Trump are lying.
There is really no need for debating. Trump will just lie and call Biden names. And he won‚Äôt answer the asked questions. The downside beats the upside If Biden debates.
And Trump has over 47 years as a conman and thief who will say and do anything that feeds his fragile ego and benefits him and his family financially.
The Federal troops are being sent in to escalate the situation so that Trump can justify the need for more aggressive tactics to solve the problem he created. That‚Äôs his MO- create a problem that, ‚Äúonly he can fix!‚Äù And, of course, blame the Democrats for the problem!
Reagan's there praying that Trump would stop plagiarizing his likeness.
Another Republican institution backing the truck up away from the boobonic plaque that is Trump.
I have had Post Trump Stress Disorder since November of 2016
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
you might as well go ahead and vote for trump #wastedvote
Trump lost another full point in all national polls today. This is the second day in a row that happened. It will continue to decline as his gestapo goon squad continues. He will be in single digits by September at this rate. Narcissistic egos are deadly. 140k+ and counting.
Just imagine if President Obama created a Gestapo Army like Trump did? Republicans heads would have exploded. Then all of these defenders of government buildings would be crying and screaming on every news channel. They are the true party of double standards.
They are on their own. With trump, they won‚Äôt get any support from the USA. More probable is a condemnation from trump. You know he would send federal troops to gas and arrest them.
Wow Comrade Putin AND Comrade Trump are having quite the time with their "subjects" lately it would seem. Unrest all over the place. Maybe their ideal world of dictatorship might not be working out after all? I'm thinking Comrade Trumps time is over on 11/03/2020 #BIDENLANDSLIDE
Perhaps if the Trump administration had taken control of the coronavirus in the beginning, they would have a legitimate beef..since they have denied any responsibility, they need to sit down and shut up
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
You ain‚Äôt rootin‚Äô tootin‚Äô about crime boss Putin. After Trump loses, to Moscow they‚Äôll be scootin‚Äô along with  who I hope the BAR will be bootin‚Äô
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
‚ÄúYour husband‚Äù suuuuure.. boy the writing style and constant immediate replies to anything trump tweets are quite uncanny for the ‚Äúwife‚Äù ... fess up eddy or Brian.. hell I can‚Äôt tell you two apart.
Trump or maybe it was Christopher Columbus. Somebody like that.I did read Mary Trumps book and she clarified that Trump has never been smart. Go imagine that.
Trump Is The Divine Intervention ......
They are cheating and can‚Äôt be trusted. TRUMP will win. BIG silent majority. Pretty sad state of affairs that one can‚Äôt support a candidate without being harassed. And harassment is because of fear
#Traitor Trump
Biden needn't spend a dime campaigning. Just let Trump do as many interviews as he can.
Wait, are you implying Biden is in charge right now? He's the one overseeing the country eat itself apart? Or is it Trump fueling the protests with secret police and tear gassing people for photo ops? How deluded you have to be to think Biden has played any role in where this is
To effect the mentality of a person, their soul, their mental health, their lifestyle, and their mentality is pure evil...  Or wait, is it purely retarded.  Some may say Donald Trump is more traumatic to American citizens than Hitler.
Yep TRUMP TRAIN all the way

And just because they are feds Don‚Äôt make them RIGHT. This is the mind of the uncle Mary Trump spoke about in her book
Really? ‚Äúfull story‚Äù, a pic is still worth a 1000 words. Clear 2 messages being sent. ‚ÄúNo justice No peace‚Äù, and stuff going on w/flags and trump shirts. Obviously things escalated by words. Then what you üëÄ. Hate.
Capitalism would have paid for the research themselves. These trump people just drive me crazy.
Well we can‚Äôt actually say we are surprised. He had a well-documented history with housing discrimination, y‚Äôknow.
All Trump Signs Here In Indiana .
Hilarious! What a spin on Covid. The problem is political games trump has been playing instead of being a great unifier he has been the great divider. To many have died for this republican bull.
Great questioning. Trump looked like a complete buffoon.
See that requires work and research which it appears is too hard for most Americans. They would rather be sheep and let the media think for them

Trump is in election trouble, so he's confusing Americans, eroding trust - Business Insider
Some Republican senators politely rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion Thursday to "Delay the Election" beyond Nov. 3, indicating that the long-shot idea is dead on arrival in Congress.
Amy's in the minority of people who get excited when Trump gains a little ground.
Black trump supporters get worse treatment than any other people in America
Now you understand why our country is so divided. It‚Äôs not trump, it‚Äôs the dirtiest most corrupt president in the history of the USA. He has put in place the beginnings of a division the will take decades to overcome.
History is a good teacher. The use of Jack booted thugs are in history and hated. Your practice of ignoring the constitution reminds me of Hitler. Thats my opinion of you when it comes to sending Feds to cause problems by basically kidnapping people off the street. Hil Trump.
President Donald Trump met Thursday with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a ‚Äúterrible story‚Äù and that he would help with funeral expenses.

Did they just say that Pence's bus collided with a Dump Trump vehicle? #DumpTrump2020
Really? MSNBC is not paying Trump any attention! Maybe Fox News will give him some time!
95K retweets=keeping the name of the Robert E Lee base! USA Population=328.2 mil! Trump uses twitter retweets as a gauge in making decisions! The ?: were these 95K retweets +ve or -ve. I know my retweets of him are -ve! #TrumpIsAnIdiot #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
We know a lot of people Don't always support the Speaker Of The House Nancy Pelosi . But I bet those people have more respect for her today, at least she honored the late John Lewis today. Unlike someone else we know who wouldn't (Trump). Kind of surprised he didn't go golfing!
Poor, poor  because #NobodyLikesMe, he emphasizes "especially me." RIP Herman Cain, evidently the last American to like Trump! #NobodyLikesTrump #ThePresidentIsACrybaby
RIGHT NOW: President Donald Trump is hosting a news conference from the White House. Watch live on Facebook:
Trump. If he keeps talking about delaying the election.
Lauren, Did You Hear that President Trump is going to introduce 600 Bull Sharks, into Lake Michigan, Only during the Summer months..as a New Habitat for them?
landslide loss is coming to trump.  The end of a directionless, fascist but short lived regime.
Senator Cronyism apparent lives in as fragile a bubble as Trump. Pity.
Should have let him have HCQ  oh wait you type of people got it taken away why because it's cheap effect and trump said it was good oh and if trump wasnt the one that said that but Dr fuckery said it you people would all be on board with it.
Is this real?
NO one wants Trump's plasma.
Ding ding ding we have a winner. tRump doesn't scratch his nuts without asking Putin.
Do you agree with President Trump? The date of the presidential election is enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Trump's wasting his time. Obama is an out-classing rule unto himself.
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill for a long-delayed modernization of the West Wing.
You mean put Trump 1st
Best thing to come out of Trump rally??
"Mr. Trump went on, ‚ÄúI had about 95,000 positive retweets on that. That‚Äôs a lot,‚Äù appearing to refer to a Twitter post last Friday in which he said that Mr. Inhofe had assured him that he won‚Äôt change the names of ‚Äúmilitary forts and bases‚Äù"  Rule by retweet
The Trump administration last week announced that it would pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for December delivery of 100 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine under development.
The disrespect continues. Hmm, what event is going on right now that would cause Trump to tweet like a jackass and then call in the press.   I hope networks refuse to carry anything he says.
I seriously disliked him while he was in office. I disliked him far less afterwards. Kept his nose out of Obama's business. I was opposed to Iraq 100%. I felt Katrina response was as irresponsible as trump's Covid response. But I never felt he was a racist narcissist traitor.
Powerful, honest essay from within on what the GOP has become. The conclusion is simple: only a major November defeat could create shockwaves strong enough to reunite the Republican Party with its conscience.
‚ÄúLife can be a challenge... But you and I can make a difference.‚Äù  If only Herman had caught a mask and some Pok√©mon instead of Rona at a Trump rally. üòî
I bet Mary Trump would agree that Fred Trump Sr. would be really embarrassed of little Donnie right now!
So it‚Äôs safe for kids to go to school, but It‚Äôs too dangerous to hold an election? Trump will do anything to stay in power. #RememberInNovember  #RidenWithBiden2020
True:
Trump is causing the Riots! He's trying to stop the people from protesting him out of office,  just as we did trying to keep him from office!
so trump wants kids to go to school 7 hours a day, 10 months a year because they ‚Äúneed to go to school‚Äù but can‚Äôt have a election... hm, seems like he only cares about what benefits himself.
Stay in the real world people! This requires a law change!
If the roles were reversed Trump would be calling for mail in voting but because his useless ass is getting booty blasted by Creepy Uncle Joe he is against mind you recently some Republicans won their primaries with mail in voting
Herman Cain has died of COVID, which he almost certainly caught at Trump's Tulsa rally on June 20. He was an outspoken opponent of mandatory masks.  Am I supposed to feel bad about this? Is my empathy supposed to be a goddamn superpower or something?
This death is added to the many thousands that Trump allowed to happen with no regret or remorse.
I agree! Trump took off the warning stickers Tulsa had put on each seat in the stadium!!! MURDER indeed!!!!!!!
This is going to be the scariest election ever. America is literally black vs. white AGAIN. If trump wins, it will be the BLM/anti trumper riots. If Biden wins it‚Äôs going to be the white supremacists rioting because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what BLM did over George Floyd‚Äù. It‚Äôs going to be war.üòî
We are burying Rep. Lewis right now! Trump refused to attend his funeral! South Bend lost a beloved mayor: Sorry, I have zero f# to give for a man responsible for so many deaths himself! Did I just say that?
Or scenario 3 His brain dead supporters meet angry citizens who have had enough of Trump and their shenanigans! There they learn what Hitler learned ‚Äú üá∫üá∏: these colors really don‚Äôt run!
You are correct to feel that way! We need to be prepared to fight back!
Just so we're clear, you can mourn the loss of both #JohnLewis and #HermanCain but they led VERY different lives. Don't get it mixed up and say Cain is getting different treatment/coverage because he was a Trump supporter. Lewis literally marched in Selma. Cain ran a pizza chain.
TRUMP: Most people with Covid just have the sniffles. We need to reopen schools ASAP.  ALSO TRUMP: Perhaps we should delay the election until after the pandemic.  What a joke! #WeWillVote
Governor Gretchen Whitmer released a statement following President Trump suggesting in a tweet that the United States should postpone the 2020 election.
He literally got it from going to that absolute joke fest of a rally Trump did in Tulsa last month this administration and the GOP as a whole is one big Jim Jones like death cult
#NEW: Gov. Whitmer comes out against President Trump's suggestion of delaying the 2020 election.
I have some cruelty online alright! Trump is a murderer!
The 2012 GOP pres. candidate attended Pres. Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa on June 20. The Trump campaign disclosed before the event that six staff members who had been working on the rally and two Secret Service members tested positive.
While you let Trump steal houses! and gut our chances for an expanded ACA! Not to mention trying to shovel drugs into the community! You have an agenda!
Conservative news site,  is reporting that Herman Cain has died from the coronavirus. He was admitted to the hospital 10 days after attending President Trump's Tulsa rally, according to the article.
Did you hear your close friend, Trump wants to delay the election?  Have you no shame ?  How can you stand by and let him get away with that. Sen John McCain must be turning in his grave. #Shameful
Why have yet to see any Republican Congress members denounce Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying an election?      where are you all at??
Anyone know what Angela Merkel and the German people think about Trump's withdrawing troops from Germany?
Note that this was also in this same op-ed: ‚ÄúBiden accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations. There‚Äôs absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn‚Äôt stop Biden.‚Äù
Not on Trump's orange tintype will the election be delayed. It isn't up to him. Mail-in voting WILL prevail, and we WILL be rid of him in January, 2021.
President Trump is suggesting to delay the 2020 general election.
#ThingsIDontUnderstand   Trump can campaign talking about shooting someone on 5th Ave and not losing any voters, but let one person say they wanna shoot him and it's all treason and secret service all over them.
NEW: President Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud:
Trump is a master troll.  He will be laughing his ass off all day at the response.  (He is NOT going to delay the election.)
Trump is an absolute MASTER.  There is no one like him.  And what‚Äôs hilarious about it all is that the leftists think he‚Äôs as dumb as a rock.  And yet THEY fall for it EVERY time!
"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???" President Trump just tweeted.  What do you think?
Oh yeah trump mulling the idea of delaying the election totally "bait" do you have any problems finding your way home at night?
Trump probably would like to do this but I'm guessing today this is about distracting from the terrible GDP numbers.
Is this how we MAGA? Declining economy. Job loss. Failure to get ahead of a pandemic.   The list goes on and on and only proves one thing. Trump is not fit for leadership. There is only one man who can lead us out of this mess. #Biden2020  #BidenCoalition
You‚Äôll never be as rich as Trump. Remember that. He gives not one shit about anyone but himself.
Trump said it about both. WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL. He doesn‚Äôt GET to separate people for ANY reason. It‚Äôs illegal. Idiot.
And you spend too much time praising the unpraisable.
I'm a big #Trump supporter but this is funny. You need to be able to laugh at your own side.

I'm sure Trump will also be facing some indictments when he is no longer president.  What we need is a president that is an actual hard working American. Not some career politician or billonaire.
Right? I understand the media has an agenda too. I make my own decisions. Which is why I didn't vote for Clinton. I don't like Biden either but he is the lesser of the two evils.  Trump will be a 1 term president and so will Biden.
Was Trump's dad involved with this project
Lol a liberal. Just because I don't like Donald Trump doesn't mean I'm a liberal. This is why he won't win in November. He needs Independent voters to win and a lot of us are turning away. His base alone isn't strong enough for the amount of votes he needs.
We have no friends or allys anymore Trump has seen to that

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised Tuesday that his economic agenda would combat long-standing racial inequalities as he sought to draw another sharp contrast with President Donald Trump.
If Trump loses to Biden and Copmala I wil die of laughter
That edited misleading bullshit! Jim cut out part where the chaos  started, by Trump's FED cult! That's OK! Because  Democrats showed how peaceful the protesters were! And Congresswoman Tlaib set the bar on Barr. He's ok with violence as long as it's Trump's violent protesters!
Our Kassandra is the new leader of birtherism, you are really Trump's biggest fan, aren't you?
No wonder trump is so gross.
#WhyIDontLikeTrump the reasons are too numerous to state in a tweet. Bottom line, I don't like #TraitorTrump #BountyGate or #PutinsGOP Fuck donald j. trump.
Trump doesn‚Äôt want another hotel built that close to his, so wants government to buy the land for new FBI bldg. Disgusting...

President Donald Trump issued a stout defense Tuesday of a disproved use of a malaria drug as a treatment for the coronavirus, hours after social media companies moved to take down videos promoting its use as potentially harmful misinformation.
This the kinda ppl Trump üò† bring out. How with what's going on in the country right now, that they would think this would be ok. Racist at it's best thanks Trump for showing you're ppl how this is okay. I'm sure this makes you happy üòä.
We all hate "trump's america." You really suck at this Donald. Look around you...this is YOUR legacy. Bet Putin is laughing at you.
You believing Biden is a rapist is about as believable as you being a ‚Äúhot girl‚Äù. You trump supporters are what got into this mess. Embarrassing.
The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor‚Äôs office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents if the state stepped up its own enforcement.
Everyone agrees these people should not be at the protests, these protests are for protestors.  The reason we know that trump sent them is because of their actions.  Now some people think they are there to do a job.

Steven Calabresi, CoFounder of the Federalist Society called for him to be impeached.  Why did Trump tweet about delaying the election? 33% drop in GDP or 154,045 #COVID19 deaths or the Lewis Funeral. Remember: With Trump, it always about him #ETTD

An administration that disregards health initiatives during a global pandemic without FEAR or GUILT of losing innocent Americans is pure evil. Donald Trump is a tyrannical narcissist. He believes that his response to the pandemic was the correct response.
I‚Äôm sure that Trump really feels bad about Cain dying.  üôÑ
If it's safe enough for trump to send our children back to school during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's safe enough for adults to vote.
Thanks for including me with these great folks Holly. Excellent job.
Also,   "Trump's not gonna delay the election, he's now got my vote" - No one  I don‚Äôt why y'all keep acting like there are any significant minds to be changed at this time. The reactions to Trump's tweets are predictable. You're not going to vote for him. Those who will will.
#Zimbabwe‚Äôs minister of agriculture has died of #COVID19. If the #coronavirus #pandemic is a hoax by Democrats to unseat Trump, why would they care about the Zimbabwean minister of agriculture and how would his death further their plans?

Why don't you go to a super spreader event? Continue to downplay, spread disinformation &amp; lies about the #COVID19 crisis. 153,000 deaths. Nearly 1,800 new deaths today. Trump threatens election. GDP down 33%. Threatening disabled children's education. Keep going #ETTD

Not surprisingly, Trump seems more concerned with being evicted in January 2021 than for the millions of Americans facing eviction over the next few months.
Trump Toady: As usual talking about nothing. Trump threatens fall election. GDP down 33%.  153,769 #COVID19 deaths. Nearly 1,800 new deaths today. And Cain dying of COVID-19 because he caught it at a super spreader event. #ETTD
We call it Trump's America.
We will be playing unreal tournament and talking about ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù and ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äù.
Trump is trying to set himself up to be a dictator, and he has been for four years now. He can't legally delay the election, but legality hasn't stopped him yet. He's not yanking a chain, he's trying to ensure he never has to leave office. Sorry you can't see that.
Trump wasn‚Äôt invited. Lewis didn‚Äôt attend his inauguration.
Yet they want a new FBI building to stop competition for Trump's hotel and 100% business write-offs so Donald Trump can lobby politicians at his hotel and golf course.   The  bill doesn't benefit the American people. It puts us in debt to  and his admin.
I feel like Herman Cain‚Äôs death is an odd variation of ‚ÄòThe Tell-Tale Heart‚Äô, where Donald‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs guilty conscience will eventually lead him to confess his murder.... oh wait, silly me - Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt HAVE a conscience.  #DyingForTrump
The 20th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution disagrees with you, not that Trump is particularly bothered by pesky things like that. His term is up in January regardless of an election. So is Pelosi's.

Trump didn't mind using mail-in voting. I think it should be a requirement that all of you, politicians, do in-person voting.
The chaos the Dems created?!? Mail-in voting has proven itself safe &amp; fraud-free by the states that have already done it. Even Republican states. The chaos created by Trump, on the other hand, will absolutely affect this year's elections, as he and his lackeys will lose.
I wouldn't use Cain &amp; Trump in the same sentence, myself!üòä
Please show me where President Trump or Herman Cain said that the virus was a hoax...never happened. Trump said the coverage of his response was a hoax. And of course the lies spread about him on social media is also part of that hoax.
Also love how this whole deal is further exposing Trump supporters for not having a damn clue about how our government or the constitution work.
Reminder that presidential terms cannot be extended. If we don‚Äôt have an election (which we will) Trump‚Äôs term will still end on January 20, 2021. The speaker of the house would take office. He is a moron and a wannabe dictator
And who knows who Cain infected/killed while he was asymptomatic. All for sucking up to Trump.

uh, no. trump tried to distract with a tweet. it‚Äôs glaringly obvious to all, he‚Äôs an unfit, corrupt, and traitorous failure. insane tweets are par for his course.
So I called back at the beginning of the pandemic that Trump would try to use it, and the rhetoric that "Democrats are trying to rig the election" to delay the election.   I was told by my friends and family that I was being an alarmist. That the republicans wouldn't go that far.
It probably was another interview bro. I HATE trump. But he never said that quote in that meme that meme has been disproven since it came out
How then do you propose??? All you have been is threaten disable children's education. No answers. You/GOP/Trump have downplayed, spread disinformation &amp; lies about #COVID19 153,085 deaths Children will spread the disease.

Lil' Marco and his magical thinking. Just like Trump when #COVID19 was going away like a Miracle in April. He talks like a test is going to be affordable. Even though people are not paying directly for a test right now the average cost of a test is $352. 153,027 deaths
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a "delay" to November's presidential election. And he's making unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
President Trump raises possibility of delaying the US presidential election, as he continues effort to cast doubt on the established reliability of mail-in voting.
Don't let Trump's rant fest distract you media. This is the story everyone should be retweeting today.
Trump tool: Why not go and give  a big hug and kiss? Are you one of those idiots putting your staff at risk telling them not to wear masks in the office? Or are you going to meet your staff face-to-face when you test positive?

Portland is normal for a lot of people in the US. This moderate tactic was proven ineffective.  Rationalization is ineffective. A moderate position isn‚Äôt gonna sway any of Trump‚Äôs base and it‚Äôs not gonna bring anybody who sat out of voting last time to the booth this time.

Our generation HAS TO TAKE CONTROL!!   For the love of God, if you‚Äôre 18 or older, VOTE.   TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO VOTE  CELEBRATE (responsibly of course) THAT U VOTED TOGETHER  VOTE TO GET TRUMP OUT OF OFFICE AND KEEP BIDEN OUT.
No matter what the court says? Are you kidding? You‚Äôre literally saying it‚Äôs fine for the Trump admin to simply ignore court orders. You are straight up saying that you do not believe in rule of law. Sick. Just sick.
To anyone who is deciding not to vote because Biden &amp; Trump are both awful candidates:    Libertarian   Green  These are two candidates who are highly educated. PLEASE look into them, &amp; if you want to see a change in the United States, SUPPORT THEM.
Coronavirus updates: Trump wonders why 'nobody likes me'; Twitter gets tough on fake cures; Cuomo gets hot over The Chainsmokers
Is Trump planning to just give out candy to the states until the election in the hopes it will buy him an election? I noticed you aren't saying anything about that or him attempting to protect his Trump property in DC instead of moving the FBI out of the DC swamp. #GOPTraitors
If trumps not smart enough to listen to the top disease doctor in the world. I guess if he were made of money trump.would then care
Many people agree with Trump, does it mean he is right?
So the Chairman of the Allen Co. GOP interviewed the co-chairman of Trump‚Äôs Indiana campaign. This is what WOWO deems ‚Äúnews‚Äù, but it‚Äôs  pure propaganda.
Not with the current President. Trump is the President who allowed Erdogan led thugs beat protesters in our capital. Did nothing and then invited him back to our country. During normal times, Erdogan would never again step on US soil and there would be severe consequences. #ETTD

I heard on Tucker Carlson that President Trump was down double digits in the pollsü§î I had to laugh ü§£ü§£ü§£ You can not get accurate poll numbers when Twitter &amp; Facebook band accounts of his supporters. #ElectionInterference #Trump2020Landslide
The question right now isn't if Biden is the *best* choice, it's if he's *better* than Trump. I say he is. (6/?)
How long has Trump been President??? Trump/GOP too busy enriching their friends. Don't pretend they cared about PPEs. Hmmm...H1N1 18,000+ deaths does not compare to 151,586+ #COVID19 deaths and we are not done. Again up to 1,000 deaths per day.
Hopefully   will not get any of the severe symptoms of the #COVID19. Even Trump conspiracy doctor states that about 20% have to be hospitalize. Even not hospitalized, I had a colleague that took 30 days to recover from it. #ETTD 151,586 deaths

Trump Tool: Have you decided threatening schools aren't the way to go? We know when Trump/GOP threatened Fed funding to schools you were directly threatening kids w/special needs and their families. Going after kids w/disabilities is the ground you stand on. #ETTD Religious???
Hmmm...Trump Tool: Did you actually talk about the #COVID19 package and what the Trump Admin/GOP are trying to put in the package. Like FBI remodel instead of moving it out of the DC swamp which would be cheaper? Wouldn't have anything to do w/Trump Hotel
Isn‚Äôt it past time for Trump Barr and Chad Wolf be held accountable for crimes against humanity? Asking for the 151,000 dead from COVID and protesters being beaten tear gassed shot with rubber bullets or illegally detained.
Strong opposing voices from all sides of leadership could help politically isolate the mob. Trump/GOP should more fervently call out Dems to join in public condemnation of these crims posing as protesters.

Personally I dont agree with needing to do that.  If you are taking it, its your choice.  If you arent taking it, thats your choice too.  I have heard for years from  about Trump "if you have nothing to hide, why are you fighting it"
I wish a reporter would ask Trump where the great and cheaper health care insurance is that he promised the last election. I believe he said it was going to be easy.
Trump falsely claimed that ‚Äúlarge portions of the country‚Äù were ‚Äúcorona-free.‚Äù Sounds like large portions of Trump's brain are intelligence-free.

So apparently after Twitter did its sweep to get rid of the bot accounts,  Trump has generated a bunch of new ones. This time with no profile pics. In fact at this point it's safe to say if the profile pic is blank, then it's a #MAGAts . Don't waste your time like I did.
It‚Äôs Trump... Almost unfckngbelievable. GO MAGATS‚Äô
For those wondering, the article links to an earlier one about the federal court order requiring the government to accept new DACA applications. Trump admin appears to be directly defying that order.

Really Adam. Because as reported the Brookings Institute (Democrat think tank) was subsource and basis of 3 years of lies about Trump's fake collusion with Russia. The Clinton campaign funneled money and the FBI paid Christopher Steele a foreign govt source. Await investigation.

Jim, the solution is simple: pull back the crisis actors in the Trump SS, and the protests will wind down naturally.  145,000 dead, Jim.  Russian bounties on American troops, Jim.  For crap‚Äôs, get your head in the game, Jim.  Nobody gets re-elected after this crap, Jim.
It may not be diagnosable, whatever it is. But, somehow, neither is trump. So, I'm not sure if I trust a doctors word when it comes to people of power.
pls do it to trump
Also if you are all about the Constitution then you shouldn't be going for Trump, cause he is everything against it.
Is that perhaps him laying the groundwork for Trump being too old to jail??
Trump has a reelection strategy?  Hahaha

What policy has he enacted to do this? It is the drug companies and universities who are leading the charge. Trump has stood in the way this whole time. Stop being a coward

Not doing anything on the Bounty that was placed on out troops that were deployed and the only people who would have known where they were was either the president or someone like a high ranking officer. So therefore Trump not doing anything about it shows that he is courrpted
No big surprise. He's got "his African Americans" and he doesn't hesitate to show his disdain for the rest. Hopefully he'll regret this at the ballot box. Trump says he won‚Äôt go and pay respects to John Lewis at Capitol

Who‚Äôs the snowflake here? I have a hairline fracture in my arm from a  identical supporter assaulting me because I voted for Trump. So glad you are all so enlightened that you feel violence is your right because we don‚Äôt agree with you.
Biden sucks and can‚Äôt hold a conversation without his dementia peaking out. My husband and I were physically assaulted by a man wearing a Biden mask because when he asked us if we voted for Trump we said yes. So glad you are all so tolerant they way you say you are.
Just like how the only way Trump will win is if his dictator friends rig the election? Cause he is only mad because people are talking shit about him when they have the right to do so.
Um we have the right to hate Trump for all he has done so stop trying to protect him from any hate its stupid. He literally commited Presidential Misconduct by putting Federal Officers in Portland to stop protesters as they were calming down.
Trump. The guy that brags about taking a dementia test
You failed to grasp the word priorities. Why the disconnect?  Could it be from listening to Trump. His inconsistent misinformation is confusing. Americans are struggling and dying, but long as you‚Äôre getting paid, have insurance and aren‚Äôt impacted you don‚Äôt really care, do you?
I used to practically worship the ground you worked on like a lot of other $TSLA fanboys but your tweets have helped me realize you‚Äôre not much better than Trump, if at all.    You could learn a thing or two from fellow billionaire

Oh. Of course it's not the number of deaths. Why because Trump said so? Everyone is against him. He is a victim. He is full of it. It only took him until July to where a mask and to say it was going to get worse before it gets better.
When you're a Republican;, they let you do it. You can do anything. -- Said in Donald Trump voice  Heck. How is Pence still using governor's mansion as absentee address? Holcomb's got some interesting roommates.

Mike -- I'm hopeful for virtual basement debates. Based on the handful of Biden virtual broadcasts that I've seen to date, I believe Zoom debates between Trump &amp; Biden would be both entertaining and draw very clear contrasts between the candidates. :)
We WILL NOT FORGET... McConnell's change of attitude is only because his POLLS are low. So now he gravels practically on his knees.   Is so worried, he's willing to even sell Trump  IS KEY TO STOPPING HIS BULLSHIT
I challenge you to speak in a unifying manner as opposed to the divisive speech you‚Äôve chosen up to this point. We are supposed to be the UNITED states of America and you were elected by and for the people. Try to remember you are a public servant.  Not a Trump employee.
Gotta give him credit for not hiding who he is. Going would have been hypocritical and John Lewis deserves only high respect which Trump is unable to show him. Sadly, he saves his respect and praises for dictators like Putin and Kim.

But yet it‚Äôs the bandwagon republicans who know nothing about the values of being a Republican. It‚Äôs not calling names, like libnut. You‚Äôre the issue with the party looking bad and wanting the division to be larger. Before trump they said nothing. They heard an asshole calling.

He used the military bases that had golf courses so why would he? While trump's golfing had been using tax payer money.

Left knows the violence is a problem so now they say Trump wants the violence. Fucking idiots if he wanted the violence he wouldnt send federal agents into harm's way. They spew that garbage on CNN and MSNBC and ignorant people just eat that up.

Why, though? I assume you support a national holiday so everyone can make sure they‚Äôre able to vote in person, since it can take 8 hours? Do you know how many Americans vote by mail in previous elections? Your boy Trump votes by mail, is he not part of the supposed ‚Äúprivileged?‚Äù

The fact that the media praises these ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù BLM protests where thousands of people are gathered and NOT A MASK IN SIGHT. Yet when Trump holds a rally or doesn‚Äôt wear a mask the media says he‚Äôs ‚Äòinconsiderate to other‚Äôs lives‚Äô.  Covid steers clear of protests or what?
Anyone notice how ever since the data regarding coronavirus was rerouted directly to the Trump campaign, it‚Äôs becoming more known that they inflated the numbers by a large amount? Nurses and doctors coming out saying they‚Äôve used contaminated test kits?
The current GOP is not the party of Lincoln and it is not the party of Reagan. It IS the party of Trump.

The problem is that Trump cannot delay the election. If he delayed it on January 20, 2021 Nancy Pelosi would be the President. Trump would be taken from the White House and then he would be facing charges for his crimes.

Mail in voting. Oblubber turns Lewis' funeral into a DNC rally. NO demonrat has condemned the riots. Fat-ass Nadler, et. al., talk over AG Barr. Peelosi calls AG Barr a blob. "Polls" show Biden way ahead (review 2016 election). I'm convinced Trump is ahead and will win, again.
Well in a 19k capacity arena where only 6k people attended, it would have been smarter to use all those empty seats to space everyone out, not cram them into the lower level. The arena staff tried to put stickers on every other seat to encourage SD, but Trump staff took them off.
WWE is the Donald Trump of professional wrestling. Pathetic.
I‚Äôm sorry for Mr. Cain‚ÄîRIP &amp; his family‚Äôs loss. It does seem coincidental. Trump had multiple staffers, secret service &amp; the OK Gov Stitt (sat together) also tested + within a few days of the rally. The Tulsa health dept was seeing a spike &amp; pleaded w/ the organizers to delay it.
Dr Birx is a coward. She‚Äôs asking Govs &amp; Mayors to do  job. Pathetic. Birx traded whatever credibility she had to be #Trump‚Äôs lapdog data cruncher. It‚Äôs a stench she will never wash off.  #AmericaOrTrump

How ignorant.  You and your Republican cronies have backed a narcissistic sociopath who takes his cues from Russia, and you want to talk about ballot harvesting?  Let's talk about Trump's goal of a fascist state and the fact there are over 150,000 dead from his incompetence.

Sorry. Down ballot effects: Congress, state legislatures, a host of other state and local offices. And states vary re: how those positions get filled if there are vacancies. This will give Secretaries of State pause. Trump can‚Äôt unilaterally do anything. 2/2

The cancer isn‚Äôt what killed him.  Amazing right? He survived colon cancer only to die from the coronavirus he caught at a Trump rally that never should have happened.

Well? they are Democrats!!! So? How many Democrats pay for their crimes !!! None that I see!!!!!!! Just Trump supporter!!!
Friends that left Vermont 2 years ago and live in Colorado. Just voted in Colorado and got mail in ballots for Vermont!!  That is what Trump is talking about!   Voter fraud is voting in more then 1 state doesn‚Äôt matter the party.
So it's Thursday. Herman Cain died of COVID, Bill Clinton slandered Stokely Carmichael, Trump finally went mask-off with his "delay the election" strategy, and some dude ate a wasp nest on video.  Did I miss anything?
Are they all sleeping with Trump‚Äôs family or best friends?
So I guess all of you want Trump back in the WH?
No: I don‚Äôt Either! I Am Surprised He Even Mentioned Something Like That! It sounds Like Something The Democrats Would Want To Do! I will Vote For POTUSA Trump no Matter What Happens! There is an Immense Problem With Mail in Votes! If the shoe was on the other Foot what a Ruckus!
I did not know how much I needed to hear Jennifer Holliday sing &amp; then hear President Obama soar &amp; speak to us all. Lordy I needed it (and my son too).  Trump is the grease at the bottom of the scuzziest most toxic barrels imaginable. Obama (&amp; Lewis) are the cream of every crop.

In fairness (because I‚Äôm better than Trump) he would have been damned if he did and damned if he didn‚Äôt. He was right not to go. He wouldn‚Äôt have been welcomed. But this just shows the depths we have descended to when the Pres of US isn‚Äôt welcomed in his own country.
Trump wanting to delay the election is concerning.
Is Fox carrying Trump? I won't check.
Trump is running out of ideas. Nothing is working for him! He has very little time before he is going to lose. When that happens he will have to face Prosecution for his Crimes!
I don‚Äôt think so. trump doesn‚Äôt want too much testing done remember? He thinks if you don‚Äôt test they don‚Äôt exist.
If trump had a different China Policy, this might not have happened.
Trump conned you. He's GREAT at it. Cons make you feel so dumb in ever placing confidence in them that despite all reason you'd rather double down on it than admit being suckered. THAT'S the con's power. Admit it while you can. History won't see you as a victim but as an abettor
Oh look!  is back to being an actual republican, rather than being a Trump lackey! Is it too late to be on the right side of history? In his case, yes, yes he‚Äôs too late

There is no ideological difference between this service and the black folks dancing at Trump's Tulsa rally. Blacks are treated as tools by the white power structure--a means to an end, as they always have been. Disgraceful.
Put that question the other way around: what conceivable motive is there for the jihad against HCQ except to prevent Donald Trump from being re-elected?
Now listen. How many times do you need to be told?  IT IS THE TRUMP VIRUS!!!!
Obama is about to talk at the John Lewis funeral. Trump the baby fool wants the attention pointed at him, not Lewis, not Obama.
I can sleep at night knowing that I didn‚Äôt vote for trump.
Care to remind Trump that there is no mechanism for that?
You talking about Trump dragging his leg the other day at the factory? I agree, probably a stroke.
You know, trump makes the same weird movements.
Even if Trump tried to do an EO, it wouldn‚Äôt even last because the Supreme Court would smack that down in an instant.  It is clear as day in that Constitution that the date does not change unless both House and Senate approves. Please.
Trump‚Äôs comments after Rep. John Dingell‚Äôs death were disrespectful.
Trump's delay statement is meant to distract from the terrible GDP numbers.  If it's not safe to vote It's not safe for kids to go to school It's not safe to go back to work Wear a mask, wash your hands, social distance #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  11/3/20
If you‚Äôd done your jobs, Hillary would be in office now. But you had such uneven coverage, you all gave Trump the mostly-uncritical boost he needed. Reporting affects the world, expect the readers to tell you when you‚Äôve dropped the ball.
Contrary to what Trump thinks, you can care about the economy while also caring about other people. They are not mutually exclusive.
They want to goad Trump into pardoning Flynn.
President Carter spoke remotely, because he is ailing. So every single living POTUS honored Lewis, except Trump.
I hope these kids will push our country over and wake up Trump Country to start taking these things seriously.
Don‚Äôt forget that absentee voting IS mail-in voting. It‚Äôs good enough for Trump, his staff, his family...but not us. US Military also vote via mail.
Haha ‚ÄúTrump has nothing on his schedule for the next 90 minutes‚Äù.  Trump never has anything on his schedule. #CowardInChief -#DraftDodgerDonald #TrumpleThinSkin #NationalDisgrace
He really knew better than to do that. It‚Äôs a shame. It‚Äôs ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got 1 choice and that‚Äôs it!‚Äù There is no Mulligan when you choose wrong. Trump is the pied piper of death and he‚Äôs irresistible to millions.
Cornyn is a trump toady and nothing more. No wonder Cruz is in a panic about Texas turning blue. You are in the Senate to represent your state, not repeat whatever bizarre statement trump makes or try to explain it away. Looking forward to Senator Hegar!!
Is Trump going to be so crass as to try to get live press coverage at the same time as Barack Obama is delivering his eulogy for John Lewis?  The TV networks should stick with the #JohnLewisMemorial.
Shows how easy it is for Trump to lead most of the Bubble media around by the nose.
And he was killed by Trump‚Äôs rally. Because he listened to Trump. Herman Cain is Dead today. Trump kills another.
Donal Trump should resign. Pass it on
You can still hold people accountable even well after they are gone and transitioned.   The whole ‚ÄúRespect the dead, don‚Äôt speak ill about them‚Äù was concocted by society to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù those in mourning. Maybe those in mourning should‚Äôve fought harder &amp; convince him ‚ÄúLife &gt;&gt; Trump‚Äù
He's assuming Trump supporters don't know.
I keep saying that if Trump wants to cancel the election and declare himself president for life, not a single Republican is going to say no.  Not one.
Of all your superb tweets &amp; videos regarding Trump, this is the most dead on. Trump uses everyone. And everyone he touches pays for it. Every one.  A prominent backer of his dies of Covid, and...crickets. Why? Because Herman Caine's death serves no purpose for Trump.
Attend a Trump rally and die.  RIP Herman Cain and probably many others. There is one thing Trump is good at: luring people to their deaths.
Take the FBI building out of the equation and you'd probably have your votes. But hey! Gotta raise the value of trump's hotel first!
...and regardless of that, we are not grading the Trump family on a curve here. Even if we were, they‚Äôd still get an F.
Oh well, trump doesn't HAVE a heart. So no worries.
Economic growth relies on people actually working. The massive stupidity and arrogance of trump and the GOP has erased 4 months of self quarantining by millions of Americans. We're back at square one, with no income and bills to pay. You may be rich. Most of us are not.
Not sure if you're trying to distract from the fed thugs suppressing protesters, the -32% drop in the GDP, the death of Herman Cain from a case of Trump Rally COVID,  the suggestion of postponing elections... there's so many options!

That‚Äôs not Trump, it‚Äôs a parody account
Reminder: tRump always pushes things as far as he can to constantly distract &amp; divide. That's his life story.
Trump, though, is not a forbearing kind of guy. However, the Pres doesn‚Äôt control elections. States do‚Äîand the presidency isn‚Äôt the only office being decided. The Q is whether enough states would throw their own governments into chaos to back Trump. I don‚Äôt have that answer. 2/2
Can‚Äôt speak to Presidential historians, but can speak to Presidentual scholars in political science: Trump is clearly within the bottom 5.
Trump is just setting up arguments for delaying/overturning election results. Barr knows he cannot change the election date. Just sand to throw in your eyes before the stormtroopers are called out.
Damn straight! America or Trump? Pick a side!
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if #GOP seize the moment &amp; saw the loss of Herman Cain as a time to take #coronavirus seriously, enforce a nationwide mask &amp; social distancing mandate and reclaim some turf from tRump? Many lives could be saved.
Infectious Disease Expert Laments ‚ÄòDistressing‚Äô Lack Of Masks At Donald Trump EventSeveral posts after today‚Äôs Funeral speculate what a Trump Funeral would be like.  I think I know why Donnie is so buddy buddy with Vladimir.  When he goes I think Vladimir will send Russian experts to preserve the remains for display in the Lobby of Trump Tower.
Yes...but that would insure Trump gets a 2nd term
Also, everyone who is making this take is telling on themselves. If you think standing up for reinstatement of landmark civil rights legislation from 1965 is the same as a partisan speech for Biden over Trump, well, what's that tell you about your party and your candidate?
Trump supporters don't care about ethics....
You listen to Trump and Fox, then follow, so you think that's what others do. You don't have a clue about reading and listening to actual facts.  Try some critical thinking and actually thinking for yourself.  There is a deadly virus.  No cure, no vaccine!  Test, trace, isolate!!

Here is something you won‚Äôt see in the media.
They would have been ‚Äúmeltdown city‚Äù with most of the stuff Trump does if Obama did it.
How embarrassing the statement that Indiana will be one of the first on board for Trump-Pence. How much lower does this administration have to go before Indiana republicans say ‚Äúenough‚Äù.
Trump is the most lawless president in history! He has nothing to do with the policing of my town or your town and if he thinks he does, as he is asserting himself in Portland, he will he shut out. Wake the hell up America.
You're right, Trump doesn't trust Science or anyone associated with it. He doesn't like anyone or anything that he doesn't understand or want to understand.
As if I hadn‚Äôt aged enough today. Seth isn‚Äôt the only one making this assessment - particularly in regards to GOP-led states choosing their own slate of electors to nullify the popular vote. It‚Äôs insane to consider, but for Trump it‚Äôs either this or indictment.

If you could make the call what would you do about Trump at this point??
You try again. He traveled all the time. And masks don't work, masks work, masks don't work, goggles and face shields work. Trump's rally had nothing to do with it except trying to make a political statement over a man's death.
The folks closest to him were along side him in Tulsa. There is no definitive way to know if he contracted the virus during the rally, yet I would feel awful if I were Trump.
This is what people hate about this man..no place for his own political spewing his hate of Trump..that is why he has been voted the worst president ever..rude n totally wrong..Obama was absolutely self consumed using a funeral to push his own thinking..sickening is what he is!!

Trump tweets the election should be cancelled due to COVID-19. If the election were cancelled the 20th Amend explicitly says the POTUS &amp; VP must vacate office of the year their current term expires. Nancy Pelosi would temporarily be President until the General Election occurs.
Well all the judicial vacancies Mitch McConnell refused to let Obama appoint have now been filled. Trump has served his purpose. Now they feel comfortable speaking out under the guise of true patriotism, forgetting how they've loaded the courts in a way to further enable Trump...
if I can shop at Walmart with my mask on! I can stand in line and place my vote on 11/3 at a voting location! Have them open! I want Trump to knows the votes that night that he lost!
C'mon guys. Cool it with this charade that the president is a good man and a noble leader. Time for the White House to encourage #Trump to resign.
Not as disastrous as a Trump press conference üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The reason the virus cases arising is because Republican governors refuse to mandate the wearing of a mask to support Donald Trump. People are dying because of his failure.
Trump is not tested multiple times a day.  There‚Äôs no clinical reason, or value, in performing the same test throughout the day.

What‚Äôs wrong with this statement is trump has no friends.
I‚Äôm years too late to the Hamilton party. But now that I‚Äôm listening to the soundtrack... it‚Äôs like Trump listened to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be Back‚Äù and was like ‚Äúyeah man I relate to this.‚Äù
Ergo Trump doesn‚Äôt know it
It pisses me off. Trump anything pisses me off!
IDC that Calabresi waited ‚Äúall this time‚Äù. His politics were winning - why would he fight? If Trump‚Äôs election threat changed that, fine. The implication to how more moderate Rs are feeling is worth it.
Please please please...when the election is over....make sure Trump doesn‚Äôt cause problems...America doesn‚Äôt need him now

Struggling to think of a single good thing that has come out of the Trump presidency.

538 was the only one who took Trump seriously in 2016. The model was good.
NewsFlash!!!! #Liberalmedia is now fully acknowledging #Trump is a complete incompetent human being. He is unable to state any single facts on the #COVID19 or Elections or the Economy. ...Catastrophe in the making
Mags is only too happy to go down with the Trump ship.
The China Virus, fuck you trump!!!
This is false there is no evidence of this towards mail-in voting. Pls vote people. It will be a great embarrassment if Donald Trump gets re-elected.
Trump still clearly has NO PLAN #TrumpVirusCatastrophe
MSNBC has spent about 15 minutes debunking the President's news conference. This is Trump's USA!
OMG I‚Äôm about to explode! Watching Trump make up BS &amp; reporters just let him! Trump has NO NATIONAL PLAN FOR COVID-19! FDA just said they won‚Äôt cut corners on vaccines, which is good, but Trump is dangerous! HE IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! #TrumpVirusDeathToll150K
Today‚Äôs press conference is a step toward damage control. Be honest Andy the press was talking about Trump accepting the November election results before the tweet and will long after the tweet all the way up to the election.
Federalist Society co-founder: Trump‚Äôs Tweet is grounds for impeachment
Powerful presser by Trump.
Donald Trump just called Protesters in Portland a ‚Äúbeehive of terrorists‚Äù  Holy fucking shit
Our country is a laughing stock bc ofTrump! He just lies &amp; lies &amp; it‚Äôs fricken ridiculous! I wish reporters would confront him...I WOULD!!Trump you know you are losing so you keep talking about voter fraud! NOW THAT IS FAKE NEWS!! 150,000+dead it is all on Trump!
Watching the news. Sudden cut out to report Trump's tweet regarding mail-in voting. Newscaster was quick to report he didn't have a choice in the matter.
Is he a slow learner? I knew pre-election that trump was a threat to our democracy.
Didn't you hear Trump saying he needed Dems help to ensure evictions can not take place at this time.
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•  Trump Might Try to Postpone the Election. That‚Äôs Unconstitutional.
‚ÄúKids are not at the lowest risk‚Äù -words directly out of Trump‚Äôs mouth
You're wrong, but I wouldn't fuck a Trump supporter with Herman Cain's dick.
When I hear Trump say "plasma" as if it's the name of a piazza in Italy, it makes me think of Big Business when  hick character says "I have to be getting back to the...Plaza Hotel." And that hotel is probably why he's pronouncing it wrong. üôÑ
The network outlets are giving Trump free press and are complicit by this daily ranting
Oh no, you may have incited another hysterical gasp from Dems who magnify anything Trump.
Donald Trump is saying he needs democrats to JOIN him in working on a bill for: - Unemployment Expansion  - No evictions - Direct Payments As if democrats haven‚Äôt been advocating for that for months. As if trump gives a fuck about me getting help. As if. Fuck
Trump told them so.
"Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats‚Äô assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic..."
Any Stock Trump endorses on Presser right now, I‚Äôm suspect of. #Trump
Also I think we have become so divided as a nation that a lot of trump supporters believe in anything he says.
Wow I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. But I honestly think that if Donald trump didn‚Äôt publicly state that it works (with no basis) we probably wouldn‚Äôt be debating it. But thank you very much for saying that.
"China virus?"  Trump had to politicize Herman Cain's passing.
Trump doesn't even know Kansas City is in Missouri üòÇüòÇüòÇ  DUMBEST PRESIDENT EVER EXHIBIT B
What are you serious! Have you no clue what‚Äôs going on right now. You better hope and pray Trump wins or our Country will be selling out to China. Democrats have lost all moral values.
Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
Trump‚Äôs morning tweet about delaying the election was a re-direct: no one is talking about the 32.9% reduction in GDP. Or the 150k dead needed to get that economy reopened.  Or how that reopening actually didn‚Äôt help the economy.
‚ÄúThe risk of an electoral meltdown is ordinarily rather small, but this November promises a combination of stressors that could lead to epic failure and chaos‚Äù we need to stay informed and alert as a society!
And John Trump
You sound like a Trump supporter
Trump? Explain in 280 characters what he had to do with it?
Right. Thanks to Covid has nothing to do with President Trump.
is suggesting he'll push to try and postpone and discredit the upcoming #2020Election. Are you going to call him out? It's time to speak up... USA or #Trump? #Indiana should know where you stand. How about you
Trump is a failure, easily the dumbest person ever elected president  Debt is spiraling, economy sputtering, Trump is a laughingstock who doesn't even know Kansas City is in Missouri, much less anything about foreign countries.  We do lead the world in COVID19 infections tho...
For good reason: *Trump's racist. *Trump can speak. *Trump can't talk about anyone but himself.
Someone with a stronger grasp of constitutional law and election laws please tell me this is not a realistic play.
No those schools (for ppl of your income level) don‚Äôt cost money. You can have the entire thing paid for. You‚Äôre just using it as a crutch so you can blame the awful life you have on president trump.  News flash: 2x minimum is still poverty, so go get your free degree!!
Wake up. That was the Hillary campaign.  It was proven long ago. Trump enjoyed tweaking Obama bc it got under the Deer Leader‚Äôs skin.
Stop the misinformation.  Trump can move, postpone or cancel the election under the Presidents Wartime Acts.   Read it and learn.  Then, tell the truth on television.
Trump's band of enablers, such as yourself, are a hate group.
In order for Trump to remain president after losing it wound take a MASS refusal among government actors to ignore Biden‚Äôs legitimacy. And that won‚Äôt happen. They don‚Äôt like him. Justice Roberts could administer the oath in American Deli and Biden will still be the president
Trump now calls a 5:30 news conference.  He is mad because the Lewis funeral coverage and not about him.  This will not be a legit news event. It is Trump rally. You are complicit.  AGAIN
Seriously. Trump is doing everything he can to try and lose this election.
Why does President Trump have such a problem with President Obama?  Well it's because he just doesn't measure up...zionsville rocks #ZionsvilleRocks #GoodTrouble
We're trying, but it's hard to de-program Trump cultists here in Indiana.  They are happily ignorant, and fiercely devout.  I'll cast my vote blue, but Indiana is steadfastly red.
There is a lot more evidence that it does not treat Covid. Take off the trump blinders and do some more reading.
Serie A started when Italy was in a far worse situation than we are...so there goes that argument. Next? Still have not addressed the numerous US leagues mentioned. Probably faked their numbers like Trump huh? The TDS is strong in this one
Yeah, interesting that young and probably even Braun will commit to this cause it is hard fixed in the constitution but always fall lock step with trump re Covid and relief even when they know it‚Äôs wrong.  Where is their backbone? They are lemmings like the rest of the GOP.
Trump makes me nervous re: what he‚Äôll do inbetween losing the election and losing power. As soon as Biden takes the oath Trump is very close to the prison cell and he knows it. I maintain that NY state DOJ or US attorney will take him down before US DOJ
They don‚Äôt even want to admit the possibility, only because Trump endorsed it! How ludicrous &amp; ignorant is that? If it‚Äôs proven to be true are these same people going to refuse to take this drug ü§™ü§™?
Ugh. Why I feel like he‚Äôs a Trump Supporter smh.
I‚Äôm not Tim, but weren‚Äôt the racist, Trump lovers that had the guy pinned to a tree?

Trump properties have made over 17 million since 2016 off of the presidency. Trump is riding on the backs of the deplorable racists in this nation and getting rich while laughing at their stupidity. He would never associate with any of you! You are the star fools in his joke.
Because he blames his incompetence on Trump. Plus, the media.
Maybe Republicans are dragging their feet on stimulus checks so Americans will get "paid off" closer to the election so Trump/GOP will get voting advantage for the "generosity". Naw, they wouldn't stoop that low...to let folks suffer for political gain.
I block Quacks if the don‚Äôt seem interesting enough to tease first. Imagine believing Trump is trying to help poor people. üòÇ
I listened to it. It wasn‚Äôt bad. Just casual discussions. Took a slight swipe at Trump but otherwise wasn‚Äôt bad
Trump is going to pardon him.
I've used mail in ballots in the past, but in the past, trump's buddy wasn't trying to totally fuck up the postal service while his followers promise to screw voters who show up for same day voting.
Your family is actively trying to dismantle this country.  Do you actually think we would focus on Hunter Biden and not on the blatant criminal acts coming from the Trump camp?
People will blame Herman Canes death on Donald Trump but turns blind eye to the fact he had stage 4 colon cancer.
Mother Nature is responsible, Trump gets a solid assist
They also have multiple championships, that matters at every level...from peers, players, fans, media, etc.  Well, maybe not politically from Trump people, but that‚Äôs little impact from their platform
Get Trump out of office as fast as possible.
Lincoln jailed the journos too. Maybe Trump should do the same.
"In contrast, there is a strong relationship‚Äîvisually and statistically‚Äîbetween districts‚Äô reopening decisions and the county-level support for Trump in the 2016 election."
lol sooo... all of the covid data that has to do with number of cases goes into a 3rd party outlet that the Trump administration chooses BEFORE it goes to the CDC...
I wonder if the media can break away from the John Lewis circus long enough to pay a small tribute to this man? He supported Trump so i'm guessing no.
I warned you about following me to share disinformation. The guy isn‚Äôt a doctor. He doesn‚Äôt understand the science, nor does Trump. You‚Äôre blocked.
Trump will win election by a landslide, carrying the House and Senate all red to finally getting rid of swamp
fuck, idk whether to vote 3rd party to help what i actually believe in, vote for biden because fuck trump but kinda feel weird bout it, or not vote at all and try to never talk about politics again in my lifeüò©ü§îüòÖ
Calling the elimination of voter suppression and racial bias in elections "divisive and partisan" is vintage Trump gaslighting. And I'm still trying to figure out how one nurses their own erection. That's some SERIOUS flexibility.
We need to defund Trump, NOW and FOREVER! Republicans, get on the right side of history. Good people don‚Äôt support lying criminals.
He's a joke!!! Like Trump never achieved the best unemployment figures ever!
When are people gonna learn that everything Donald Trump touches dies? I have been saying it for over 4 years now.
Just an opinion; Will Trudeau go to the joint. Maybe this is the Trump curse 0ooooo!!!
Bezos and Zuckerberg? Are you kidding? Zuckerberg has put Facebook at the full disposal of the Trump campaign. Bezos is one of the richest men on the planet.  He's not a liberal, he's an oligarch.  Whether they vote for Trump or not isn't even relevant.

I sorry to hear of any COVID death that perhaps could have been avoided. I do wonder what Trump‚Äôs definition on patronism is.
Trump meets with the family of  Vanessa Guillen  via
Every Thing trump Touches Dies.  Fitting title for a book written about you.
Trump is stealing tax payers money through his campaign and through his family business. I haven‚Äôt heard a peep out of you on that front! Can I put you down in the ‚Äúfuck America‚Äù column? That is where the rest of the GOP is these days. All except one honest sole, Romney!
No idea how you went from Obama to Trump. Literally, no idea.
They all seem to be cut from the same cloth.  #Trump sexually assaulted a People Magazine reporter in his home, while wife #3, Melanie, was upstairs. There ought to be some sort of genetic test before these fuckers can get into office:
To the detriment of such an important case, Trump lost again. Vanessa Guillen and her family deserved better than this. They deserved their own spotlight - not to be used a a prop in a child‚Äôs game.
Everyone should see this clip. Very powerful message about #VotingRights - Obama's jab at Trump gets standing ovation
You can generally only do 1 'big' thing during a time of all party control, Obama/Dems did 'Obamacare'  Trump/Reps did 'tax cuts'.

Can‚Äôt stand being upstaged by Obama even if it is at a Funeral.  Trump had nothing sled!

So what you‚Äôre saying is, you‚Äôre voting for trump?
So one of the "black voices for trump" who let that man use him to convince uneducated blacks to ignore his racism and support him just died. He died because of stupidity. #HermanCain
I'm glad you actually made your point clear. First it was the picture, but its actually making it political in the first place LIKE TRUMP HAS BEEN DOING FROM THE START
If he had, you would have whined that he had no right to be there. Lewis hates Trump. Not disturbing the setting was actually very adult. Unlike your idiocy
At least Obama was completely incompetent and cared about the welfare and security of the United States.  I am a Republican and you can't say anything like that about Trump.
Really?  And you don't think Donald Trump commits gaffes, indeed a heck of a lot more than Biden?  This is such a stupid issue for Trump supporters to raise.
At least Trump ‚Äúgot off‚Äù
The problem is, Cruz is a Trump Ass Kisser!
Thursday afternoon with Sean:  ‚Äì  Our dear friend Herman Cain has passed away ‚Äì  WA Gov bans weddings, funerals, gyms, &amp; bars (but not ‚Äúpeaceful protests‚Äù) ‚Äì  President Trump asks those who have recovered from COVID to donate plasma  AND,  stops by....
You just said someone else put up a picture to get points when the only person to put up a picture was Trump. Its okay for Trump to do it but no one else? Got it.
So will Trump attend his funeral?
It really isn‚Äôt as neither are a requirement. Look at the original response. They say Trump never released his returns and then follow it up with ‚Äúhe‚Äôs never paid taxes‚Äù. We all get it.
That's how Trump keeps his "96% approval rate" with Republicans - The party just keeps getting smaller as the dissonants jump ship.
What I love is I know Trump watched this and was losing his  mind.
Don't you see why trump is spreading the virus, he's trying to cancel the vote? It‚Äôs Why he has a rogue group kidnapping/beating protestors, he is trying to create everything thing we fear. We must stop him. He is out of control. He is infecting us all!!

I know this is satire, but most #Trump supporters won‚Äôt understand that.  #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsARacist #COVID19 #TrumpleThinSkin
How can trump claim to be so headstrong about conserving our constitutional rights. Yet there is so much talk of the possibility of our RIGHT TO VOTE being taken away. We need to fix this ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù because rn were all screwed.
A Half-Century After Wallace, Trump Echoes the Politics of Division
wanting to delay the #Election2020 because of the so-called "ChinaVirus" is the most  move he could make.  Hilarious, ridiculous, repugnant, and tyrannical.  All the makings of Donny Trump. #VoteJoJorgensen #JoJorgensen2020 #VoteGold2020
You are so far gone. THE ONLY PERSON WHO PUT UP A PICTURE OF HERMAN CAIN HAS BEEN TRUMP.
Dems have to stop overreacting to Trump's tweets. We cannot continue falling prey to every one of his nonsensical, off-base "thoughts". 3.5 years in &amp; he still gets people to question whether his illegal/anti-Constitutional suggestions are possible. #IgnoreTrump
Thanks for asking the question. I emailed my concerns about Trump‚Äôs statement to the governor‚Äôs office this morning.  must make it clear that Indiana will take steps to ensure all can vote safely and without having to wait hours.

Umm. he was convicted. The joke is you   What does Trump have on you? Underage boys?
Number 11!   Facebook  and twitter  are silencing  truth and conservative  Trump supporters
The entire state of Oregon votes by mail? That sounds blissfully wonderful, compared to standing in line for what was 90 minutes during the last Presidential election for me, as I recall.
I wish I had video of  reaction when I asked what he thought about President Trump suggesting the November election be delayed.
After a Black man dared to sit at the Resolute Desk, Republicans voted in Trump to show the Presidency isn't an important role. They couldn't stomach the highest office having been held by Obama, so they reacted by electing the dumbest white guy they could find.  They failed.
So basically, Trump did whatever he could come up with to distract from John Lewis' Memorial.  What a complete loser...
Really, Herman had colon cancer? That is extremely relevant.  He definitely should have steered clear of large groups, but clearly we don't have a clue if he caught COVID at Trump Rally (that's media hype).  If I have Stage 4 colon cancer, I think I'd throw caution to the wind.
Trump has made this entire health crisis about him. Over 100,000 people died on his watch.
If Barack Obama was Donald Trump, we would all have gotten F__ked for 12 years.

This theory is not supported by the religiosity of the Trump base.  Could be that the impulse to idolize politicians comes from the same place that strong religious beliefs come from.

It's always sad when someone dies. I just can't feel sorry for a man who pretty much asked for what he got. I hope the people following Trump who still think Covid is nothing to be worried about finally realize their leader is a nutjob.
When children begin to die along with the families they infect, what will Trump say about his responsibility?  This is totally unforgiveable. The election cannot come soon enough for me.
The ignorance of the Trump supporters is amazing but no longer surprising.
I feel like Trump is playing games with us! He's putting so much on our plates and it's so overwhelming. We need to stop and regroup. We need to start a revolt! We need our voices heard! We must make trump resign!!
Y‚Äôall are too stupid to debate on these issues. Trump does anything, you do the opposite so it‚Äôs pretty easy to know what your leader are gonna do next.
Alternatively, Trump could going on about vote-by-mail to divert attention away from the fact that his rally last month basically killed Herman Cain.
What's "Trump" got to do with it? Wearing a mask during a pandemic, IMO is purely a health issue, not a political one-much like second-hand smoke.
Delaying the election simply makes Nancy Pelosi president on Jan 20. Trump‚Äôs setting up a post-defeat narrative. Most likely, he‚Äôll buy Onan or another fringe network and create a grievance community around a myth of a stolen election

Said it before and I'll say it again, Trump is a MASS MURDERER and we need to take measures to protect ourselves!!
In 14 days texas is going to regret allowing trump‚Äôs fundraiser. Lots and lots of dead cult members walking! He better not be allowed in Indiana.
Maybe I wasn't clear, sorry. Why are the Dems upset about a comment regarding postponing the election. Why would that give someone an advantage over another? Should I not categorize the people who dislike Trump as Democrats?
This is Trump making good on his promise. Don‚Äôt wanna pay your tab? Fine. Don‚Äôt come calling us when your getting your shit pushed in Merkel.
I read early today he was doing better and then boom he's dead. I thought it was fake. I made the call he was going to die since that's how karma works, he let people down. The fundraiser trump had yesterday is going to kill trump!
Trump really thinks he‚Äôs king! Come on Americans, let‚Äôs dethrone him!
The Trump campaign‚Äôs decision to shift ad spending away from Michigan comes amid signs that the state may no longer be the battleground that both parties had once thought it would be in 2020, especially given Trump‚Äôs narrow 10,000-vote win there four years ago. Good luck.

Can we throw fruits and veggies at Trump...Trunchball style when he is escorted from the White House?
So you are saying that Trump and his family are cheating? Almost his entire administration vote by mail. Or is ok for our dear, fearless leader to do it but no one else?
No Trump. No Biden.

Former Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain has passed away from COVID-19. Mr. Cain attended Mr. Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa in June.
Do you really think that all historical data is manipulated to make trump look bad?
Ppl like Giuliani and Trump don't give AF about us and will gladly sacrifice us to make a point smh   I wish more ppl realized that before its too late
I know  is super pissed that Herman Cain is trending for dying after attending Trump's Tulsa rally and becoming infected with COVID 19. Because he couldn't care less about the man...
You can ask my five adult sons for verification, but for months I have been saying that Trump is going to attempt to flee to Russia if he loses the election.
Was wondering Marianne, would it be wrong to believe trump could be dealing with rogue aliens on his side? I know there are things happening that are not what they seem! Why has he not gotten COVID19?
Yes, it is true.  Most nations have banned United States Americans from entry, due to so many of them being infected with COVID-19.  The USA has become a cesspool of disease, thanks to Trump Exceptionalism.
Hmm white guy stabs black trump supporter  because the black guy isn't down with #BlackLivesMattermovement ?   Who wrote this script?
Let me see if I got this right, 1 black trump supporter was killed after doing an interview saying he supports Trump  this guy gets stabbed by a white guy that was stalking him.   You response is this?
If we have in-person voting Trump will win easily if we have a million vote Joe Biden wins in a landslide
As I drive around our country working I see no Joe Biden signs no Joe Biden banners  but the media says he is winning over Trump everywhere all I see are Trump flags and banners are they trying to prepare us for a fraudulent mail-in voting system
Idk HOW you‚Äôre still support trump at this point
Just watch how many here will have the virus. This was a very sad event to do in the middle of a pandemic, in the worse hit location in the world! Wtf. Trump just infected a bunch of his cult followers so they can spread it. Why does he not get it??
You just described trump. üòÇ
Biden (April), "Mark my words he will try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held." Trump‚Äôs response, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate out of touch with reality." Trump today, ‚Äúdelay the election‚Äù
Which he contracted at Trump‚Äôs failed Tulsa rally. Literally dying to own the Libs.
Time for conspiracies and manufacturing evidence to keep Trump in office.
He did but he disagreed with his recommendations multiple times. I watch them both and I think trump cares more about the stock market. I think fauce wants to slow the spread.
If there is no election, then Trump and Pence will turn into pumpkins on January 20, and the entire House and 1/3 of the Senate will probably be vacant. (2)
Gotta Love Trump... He really knows how to troll the Left. It's so easy to trigger these idiots. I'm sure he was Laughing when he sent it.  Hook, Line &amp; Sinker.. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§Ø
Don't be like trump and use comments like 'short bus' that degrade people with learning disabilities. If you are going to pretend to be better better and more educated than trump, don't use these kind of hurtful and bully-like comments.
This is what Shucking and jiving at the Trump rally with NO MASK ON got him. That‚Äôs unfortunate....  But anywhoo- #BIDEN2020ü§òüèΩ
OMG!   People have to come together and #vote #Trump out!  #WeWillVote for #JoeBiden!
One less Trump supporter.
I would gladly go vote against Trump, in person, in an ER ward, in the hottest hot spot in the nation, even if I were gravely ill and had to walk miles to do it in a severe thunderstorm.
Now we get to hear from 3 former presidents. Presidents who have been accused of being the worst ever, who have been impeached, and a president who has been called every racist name that exists; and we were told he devided America into a huge race war. Tell me more about tRump?
Let‚Äôs not act surprised that conspiracy theories usually trump fact based evidence. It really just shows how the gov and biz have fucked us over so many times that it unbelievable seems valid.
Wtf are you talking about. All of the liberal fucks you praise are the ones going down. Trump isnt going to be involved in any of those document dumps.  Sorry to burst your bubble.
President Trump has now suggested that the #2020Election be postponed. We cannot allow him to be elected again. I urge everyone to #VoteByMail or on November 3rd because we cannot have another four years of this. We need to vote him out of office!
I guess you could say I‚Äôve always aligned w republican values but I hate trump. I liked him in the apprentice. Lost respect every time I heard him speak since the debates in 2016. But he was the best bad option we had at the time.
Fuck Trump.  There. That‚Äôs all.
Also, Trump‚Äôs election ‚Äúannouncement‚Äù conveniently takes the spotlight away from this...
Bill for the sake of this nation don‚Äôt you think is time to distance yourself from President Trump?
Best get used to it- AA‚Äôs supporting Trump, I mean. Biden‚Äôs an admitted racist and anyone who can‚Äôt see it is blind. I work with 6 African-Americans (4 male, 2 female) and 4 of them voted for Trump in ‚Äò16 and all 6 of them say they are going to vote for him this year.
Sure, Trump, like Jim Jones, served up the kool-aid, but Cain, like those in Jonestown, chose to drink (and he didn't have armed guards to make sure he did). He made his choice - and paid the price.
And you thought I was kidding about leftists wanting you dead just to own Trump.  This people are sick!
I was saddened by Cain's death partly because it hurts that so many people are willing to put their lives at risk to stay in Trump's good graces. That's too big a price to "own the Libs".
Sadly, we know the answer: it‚Äôs because Trump endorsed use of the DRI
Trump‚Äôs ridiculous tweet today about delaying elections is an attempted distraction from today‚Äôs GDP free fall, possibly killing Herman Cain with his ill-advised Tulsa rally, and yesterday‚Äôs racist tweet about keeping poor people out of nice neighborhoods.
I don‚Äôt know what 4 more years of trump will do to this country. Maybe we‚Äôll just implode
Coal is still very necessary and being used in many electric plants as well as being exported to other countries ... it‚Äôs only on decline because of regulation ... Trump reversed those regulations ... it‚Äôs made a major comeback ...

HAHAHA I didn‚Äôt mean the Beth Moore tweet. I meant this link:
Well, I keep calling for Trump to resign, but do I get my way? No, so why should he get his?
#WeWillVote trump out Nov 3!
Ain‚Äôt nothing wrong with gassing up your friends. I do it all the time. That being said, make sure your friends know what they are saying and doing. The last thing you need is them and you looking like a bunch of dumb dumbs. #WearAMask #RonaisReal
Where does President Trump get his from Biden?  To date, the President has done nothing in an attempt to delay the election.  was right in April and it has aged well. The tweet today does not qualify as a plan and was not even a suggestion is should be done.
You're really defending Trump? What kind of fool are you?
This is nuts. Many elderly and overweight in this line - no way that anything Pence might have to say would be worth risking infection during a pandemic. The Trump administration is completely and utterly irresponsible.
I hope she‚Äôs waging war on Trump because this falls squarely on his weak shoulders
Not really, you were bashing a guy who I think is doing a pretty good job. He‚Äôs not perfect and has made mistakes sure. But I think he‚Äôs doing a much better job than trump.
We haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôm sure trump didn‚Äôt . I think it should be brought up a lot in October
Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so  oh, here we go.
#MarketTumbles  The #Democrat Congress, Governors &amp; Mayors are intent on destroying the economy to hurt Trump &amp; Americans all for their political gain. Lockdowns, Businesses Closed, Unemployment Handouts, Riots &amp; Anarchy is their game. We MUST #VoteRED2020RemoveEveryDemocrat
No doubt Dr. Birx would‚Äôve said this months ago had Trump not stifled science and medicine. This is why COVID-19 is the Trump Virus. This is why he owns 150k+ deaths and the worst economy on record. Had he prioritized public health over his political future, this would be over.

He's up against Trump, the luckiest sob on the planet!
Maybe this is the moment where many of the President's most ardent supporters will begin to look at things the way Trump sees it: This is a dangerous virus for those in high-risk categories, and personal precautions need to be taken because pretending isn't an antidote.
I don't want to to be callous, because this is a tragedy for Cain and his family... But Cain, a 74-year-old survivor of colon cancer, presumably caught COVID-19 at the June 20th Trump Tulsa rally. Like most of the attendees, he was not wearing a mask.
They would TOTALLY do that if it had been Trump.

#BREAKING - Herman Cain, a successful businessman who ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and later became a backer of President Donald Trump, has died from complications from #COVID19.
I bet that's exactly what trump wants.
Another outstanding example of Trump Exceptionalism.
Trump suggests delaying November election  via
Furthermore, if you think it's wrong, you're as big of a hypocrite as you're accusing Dems of being if you condone it under Trump and constantly misrepresent what Obama did. Obama is not responsible for Trump's actions today or in the past 3.5 years.
An F&amp;M poll puts Biden ahead of Trump by 9 points in Pennsylvania.   For context: if Biden wins PA, Trump NEEDS to win Michigan, North Carolina, or Florida.  Biden‚Äôs magic number is 35, which represents the number of electoral votes he needs to flip.
1) This economic free fall could have been prevented had the Trump Admin. taken the #COVID19 threat seriously from the start.   2) We can prevent future damage by passing the #HeroesAct, which strengthens our fight against the virus and helps protect millions from financial ruin.
No, you're missing the point. Trump, not Obama instituted the policy of family separation. Obama kept kids who crossed the border alone. Trump separates families crossing together in order to punish them for seeking asylum and to deter future people from seeking asylum.
Hey bone spurs, Let‚Äôs Make America Great!   By killing off the republicans, thank you for your support with the trump rallies!!!  And by the way GDP is -33%, worst ever!
Donald Trump is responsible for Herman Cains death, he caught COVID at that trump rally. But Cain signed the waiver, so what do you say.
Why do we call it the #TrumpVirus? He is leading his followers to their death. Cain attended Trump's rally in Tulsa, celebrated the fact that masks would not be worn, "People are fed up!" he said. Less than two weeks later, Cain was hospitalized. That's one way to own the libs...
Trump assured us it was nothing.... for months Do you feel safe today with what he assures you? How many more months until you can be sure?
You mean trump?
QUICK PSA: Trump has no authority to do this so don't worry. It would take a bill passed in both branches of Congress, which would never happen.
Trump's doing everything he can to lose the 2020 election and honestly, I think it's intentional. He doesn't have the same vibe he did back in 2016.

Trump killed him. #TrumpKilledHermanCain #TrumpVirus ü¶†
That is the devastating news. Covid19 deaths over 150 000,Hermann Cain dies after attending Tulsa rally, his death is on Trump
Aannnyyway....while we‚Äôre all flipping out about Trump‚Äôs delaying the election, the economy had its worst contraction in history, 10% of the country is unemployed, a virus is raging and Congress is playing politics with the help our country desperately needs.   Happy Thursday!
Yeah, I got laughed at alot in the summer of 2016 when I said, repeatedly, that Trump was going to win the swing states that he won and beat HRC. Hoping Trump keeps fucking up is not a plan. I swear, y'all learned nothing 4 years ago. But keep on laughing until November.
Let Trump tell his base he is delaying the election.  Then they won't show up and vote. üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ  Trump floats delaying election despite lack of authority to do so
Cain caught COVID after attending Trump's Tulsa rally without wearing a mask.
The election is rigged, unless I win. Foreign interference is bad, unless it helps me. This is Trump‚Äôs electoral philosophy
That's...not how this works. Trump's Senate "trial" wasn't a twofer. Had he been removed, Pence would have become POTUS and the Senate would have fast-tracked Cotton for VP appointment. The House Dems are too afraid of their own power to have even been able to stop it.
I guess I‚Äôm voting for Trump by voting for  ? Well that doesn‚Äôt make sense.
And now he's dead üíÄ  From Covid-19 from going to a Trump rally  Life and Death comes at you fast
would think ppl realize at this point that Trump goes to an extreme to 1) dictate the discussion and 2) lay out the negotiating field
Hes an awesome person and doing a honest job unlike you a corrupted politician who spreads hate throughout our country. Vote Trump 2020!!!
trump could die of Covid in the middle of 5th Avenue and some of you would still call it a hoax ü§î
Herman Cain dead after being hospitalized for Covid. He was diagnosed after attending Trump's Tulsa rally. Was an anti-mask proponent.
I'm voting for Joe to FIX the mess Trump has made. Fixing the divide in our people will take a while longer.  Biden can honestly give us the background to start healing again.
Wow. It's Trump's voters who will be all violent in the streets? Leftist projection is hilarious.
I'm mad Terrence K Williams and the other young Black Republicans killed Herman Cain... What type of Sith ish is that ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I guess when you in your 70s you gotta stay away from Trump rallies where nobody is wearing a mask
It's not brilliant, actually. Trump is 100% in control of this race. The swing states where Biden is ahead are because of things Trump does or does not do.  Biden hidin' isn't leadership. It shows he cannot move the needle on the poll numbers. That should be deeply concerning.
The #TrumpCult going to have a lot of "last seen after a Trump Rally" in their obituaries. ü§°
Yes, they were selfless and true heroes.  So how about you honor their legacy by trying to do the same?  Say SOMETHING a/b Trump‚Äôs idea of pushing back the election!!!
Can we all agree that Trump just killed a member of his own campaign? #COVID19 #HermanCain
DO NOT believe what Trump says about the polls.  DO NOT think this is for others to decide. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020  #VoteForOurLives  VOTE, VOTE, VOTE
It‚Äôs obvious they will not stop, I believe the worst is yet to come, if trump wins , watch out for November 4th. There‚Äôs no talking to them, only way to stop it is pure force , hate to say it.
Donald Trump? Guy's got a couple of nuts rolling around in that head of his.
Herman Cain died from Covid-19 that he contracted from a Trump rally, after showing up without a facemask.
I know Trump has done countlessly cruel and awful things but this just feels as bad as almost anything he has done. For his own vanity he held a rally and basically murdered a person who came
I'm honestly speechless.  Herman Cain attended Trump's Tulsa rally along with several other Black Republicans to show solidarity with Trump.  About a week later he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and now this. Agree with his politics or not, this is extremely tragic. Rest in peace
More on Herman Cain, who died today if COVID-19.   Cain attended President Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
If Trump runs me 3 stacks imma be hard pressed not to vote for him. üò≠üòÇ
Oh forgot Trump is burning down the city not the protestors... my bad
Nope. In fact, in Florida (the state where Trump voted mail-in) there is no "absentee" ballot, only mail-in.
If you want President Trump to win in November you must vote and bring everyone you know along with you.
a prominent Black Trump supporter goes to his Tulsa rally with NO MASK  And Now he's dead from COVID-19 WHOOPS  #hermancain
I'm a big Trump supporter. But with this press and the environment... STOP SPIT BALLING on TV!!! Uggggh   this is the type of shit that frustrates me and difficult to defend    same exact issue with injecting bleach.  He was spitt balling
I'm sure there have been others already, but Herman Cain has to be the most public person to die in sacrifice for the Trump cause.
Absentee voting in Florida (where Trump voted) is actually called mail-in voting.
Breaking news: President Trump‚Äôs campaign agrees with him!
I can barely make sense of your response.  It's a twisting of words and facts.  China did not let people know how dangerous this was and was irresponsible.  However, Trump is responsible for this horrible ravage in our country.  He's done nothing to help. No two ways about that!!
A thread on how Republicans stomped their feet and feigned outrage that anyone could possibly think Trump would try this (hint: nearly every Dem by now assumed he would try)...
I'm old enough to remember when Trump announced his campaign, Ari said something to the effect of "We need to find a way to get rid of this guy before he hopelessly damages the brand of the GOP". Ari was right back then.
Please help Trump win and make Nancy pay for all her crimes.
Well this year it was in early May but not sure if that‚Äôs normal. Last school day was in March because of the Trump plague
American presidential elections have been held through a civil war and a world war. We can, and we will, hold an election this year too. If President Trump can vote by mail, then so can the rest of us. Our democracy depends on it.
Trump is a traitor.
I‚Äôve been saying this for a while.  Trump is very good at creating big headlines that are ultimately less important than the ones he‚Äôs covering up.
Mr. Trump, Can you please remove all racists from my white suburban neighborhood?
You also don‚Äôt see how horrible Trump is - doesn‚Äôt make it not true. üòä
Not on your life.  Her agenda is politics not America.  She and her party have cost this country millions if not more.  I don't want to delay the election.  I don't want Trump and I don't want Biden.  I think the country is in for one hell of a ride the next four.

I woke up ready to have a productive Thursday.   Then I saw that Trump wants to delay the election.  Time to switch from coffee to whiskey.  #politicsamiright
Good luck in Texas &amp; Florida! Trump already gave up on Michigan. PA is next.
The fact that he's bringing it, regardless if he has the power or not, makes it a valid question. Plus, it allows his followers to go on record. Are you for Trump or democracy?
People are hilarious.  points how likely fraud is with mail in balloting. Says if people are petrified to leave their house to vote then MAYBE we should delay vote until we can have a secure election. People lose their mind saying Trump is trying to stop voting.
Honestly everything labeled ‚ÄúTrump plan/admin‚Äù are probably just programs from hellspawn Conservative thinktanks. The man is incapable thinking more than 2 original ideas on his own in a year. But when he does, he accidentally throws out good ideas that even a toddler understands
And if Trump does cancel the election, and stay in office by sheer force of will or some sort of military shenanigans, it's time for every person who remains Trump supporter to give up the label "Patriot" because at that point you will in fact be a Tory.

The Democrat controlled house isn't going to pass a constitutional amendment to change election day, doofus. BUT Trump is setting stage to challenge the election results if he loses FOR SURE
Though, since there is no way that Congress will approve a delay of the election, it's a completely useless and toothless threat on Trump's part. And he knows it. Thus, it's a distraction.

Trump is suggesting delaying the election, but that's just because he wants to distract from the abysmal economy and the horrifying COVID numbers, as well as the fact that Obama is going to be out there sounding like a functional adult and capable leader at Rep. Lewis's funeral.
No surprise that COVID has become Schr√∂dingers Virus for Trump: A virus that is simultaneously overblown fake news and a bad enough epidemic to delay an election.

Now would be a very good day for EVERY Dem Rep and Senator to get in front of a camera and tell the American people that the election date is set by Congress and Congress alone. And then point out Trump's shitty economy.

Of course. Anyone surprised by this hasn't been paying attention. What's baffling to me is the people who support him are by and large the "Merica is the best" patriotic crowd. But Trump has proven countless times that he doesn't care about the country or democracy in general.
The only positive to a Trump presidency is that he‚Äôs too fucking stupid to be good or subtle about how evil he is. There are other people who could have done it better, so it‚Äôs really a blessing how stupid and blustery he is.

You need to issue a statement IMMEDIATELY pledging to hold an election on Nov. 3.  Institute mail-in voting as a safeguard, NOT delay the election as Trump wants.  NO ELECTION DELAY. FOR ANY REASON.
Reports say President Trump is calling for a delay to the US general election.
It‚Äôs election law to report ad campaign spending and that record can be checked by anyone. The Trump campaign has not purchased new ads since 7/5.

Please God, I pray Trump kicks a** again. Of course like those who promised to leave the country this is just another lie. The L is for lie.
You kill the illusion like Trump is suggesting, there‚Äôs no going back for a much bigger demographic.  I‚Äôve been pretty certain his advisors are slinking away and I think we‚Äôll see the moderates like Romney endorsing Biden if this keeps up.

1) Absentee voting IS mail-in voting.   2) Donald Trump lacks the executive authority to delay the election. It's in the Constitution.   3) His mishandling of the pandemic is exactly why we can't delay the election. The longer he is in office, the more people die.
Trump is the greatest threat to America in its history. Let‚Äôs ship him over to Russia come November so he can practice what he preaches. Vote him out.
I dunno guys I'm beginning to think this Donald Trump guy isn't on the up and up

Don't forget to wash your hands...(of Trump).
One of the things I wish more of the 'hold their nose and support Trump' contingent (as opposed to the cult) would notice is that he *never* references democracy. Not even casually. He doesn't believe in it, doesn't respect it.
Also statements when you have to backtrack but none to protect the people and fight against tRump and his handling of the Pandemic and the now over 150K DEAD!

32.9% drop in GDP will seem tame if/when Trump delays election or won‚Äôt leave office.
Trump is done lmao
Trump just proposed "delaying"  the election. This man has dictatorial aspirations
All of the above. It is the personality, the lies, the corruption, the unfit and unqualified to hold the office. Huge EMBARRASSMENT to the United States of America.
Trump's motives are as obvious as the orange makeup all over his face.
#Resisters #BlueWave #Biden2020  Follow me if you're for human rights and want Trump out of office
Fake president Trump, who couldn‚Äôt win anything in a fair contest, merely stripped all the safeguards from industry to make them more profitable at the expense of our environment and our health.
Fake President Trump, who won the presidency because of Russian interference in our elections, is taking your campaign donations and paying his business 7 times fair market value so he can profit from the election. Trump supporters are total suckers. üòÜ
your hatred is showing!//www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-suburban-voters-suburban-fair-housing-act-1032625/
libs don‚Äôt want a cure or anything that helps because it goes against everything to get rid of Trump. Pretty easy-if it doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative to get rid of Trump, they won‚Äôt support it.
Yes yes yes. This former lifelong Republican is still a conservative, but we must unseat Trump to save the country. He is an existential threat to our national security and our democracy. Wake the hell up America!
The catastrophic disaster is Donald Trump. He owes Putin Bigley and he is selling America‚Äôs security to pay the bill. If you are a Trump supporter after the Helsinki summit, you are a complete idiot. Real conservatives recognized what was going on. They will support Biden.
Ooh wow!!! This really cool and true because NO BODY LIKES TRUMP AND MOST OF OUR AMERICANS HATE YOU FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER
I‚Äôd unhitch myself from the looney tune Trump wagon. You‚Äôll lose all credibility, if you haven‚Äôt already.
Listen Nikki, I thought you were intelligent at one time. But if you have to question Twitter or any social platform taking down Trump tweets supporting a wacky Dr. that promotes outrageous lies. Like demons impregnating women. Really? Come on now!
No one else but President Trump could have withstood the hatred and vicious attacks for the last 3 1/2 years. We must pray for God to protect him, his administration, and his family. We must pray that God will preserve this great nation. Let‚Äôs do it patriots!
Do you know HIS name? Does his life matter? Trump supporter murdered outside his office in Milwaukee.  In some of his videos, he says he fears being killed for his views. Last Thursday, he was right. His name was #BernellTrammell #BlackLivesMatter?
#California    The defendants allegedly engaged in the solicitation of hundreds of false and/or forged signatures on state ballot petitions and voter registration forms by offering homeless people $1 and/or cigarettes for their participation.
Just because he supports Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt mean he don‚Äôt have democratic view points. I commend him for doing what‚Äôs right for his country and his constituents over his party. If Democrats were more like him , thier party would be an option.  Hopefully theirs more like him
Trump tells voters in suburbs they will ‚Äòno longer be bothered‚Äô by low-income housing
Are you really so naive to believe this is news? NEWSFLASH! people dont like Americans. This has been going on for decades. Bit since you brought it up, what should Trump do about it?
The Lincoln Project are Republicans. They want Republicans in office, just not Trump. Their ONLY goal is to replace Trump with the closest thing to a GOP they could find, Biden.
Why ? You can‚Äôt stand the fact that he‚Äôs right,tells the truth and you can‚Äôt accept that you‚Äôve lost your way ! Today‚Äôs a good day to wake up and follow the facts ! You may not like Trump but it‚Äôs about his track record ! And see if you‚Äôre still in denial ?
Y'all remember when Marco Gutierrez of Latinos for Trump said that if Hillary won there'd be a taco truck on every corner? That was the ultimate "threaten me with a good time", and it's just tragic it never came to fruition.
1. I think the comparison is not off base. Fame and celebrity both derived mainly from who you marry or who your parents are and the fact that you have lots of money.  2. I don't mind names for trump if they are accurate.  3. You're also right, I'm probably being hypocritical.
I would totally believe Trump gets his news from Facebook
Trump's not only lazy, he's stupid.
Can we just focus on the task at hand, every vote possible to remove Trump and GOP cronies.  Why self destruct over a VP choice?

Yelling at the left about not voting for Biden instead of phone banking those sweet, sweet conservative swing voters y'all think are the key to a Biden victory doesn't seem like an effective tactic. Spoiler: those swing voters either gonna stay home or vote Trump again.
Dem here, but I actually remember watching a GOP debate featuring the second tier candidates in 2016 thinking I actually liked Lindsey Graham a bit.  He‚Äôs done a complete turnaround selling his soul for Trump like all the others (except Romney).  It‚Äôs very tragic and sad, really
Yes the same agencies that wanted Trump not to be elected ...  Russia spent approximately what 100k on misinformation ? Bloomberg spent how much trying to win a primary ? A billion and couldn‚Äôt sway anyone .... you‚Äôre a fool ...

Maybe instead of being a libertarian, which is just a republican who wants to smoke legal weed, you should actually look at her policies and consider how not good for this country she is. Better than Trump? Sure. But if we're settling anyway, at least settle for a democrat.
I'm guessing this is all diversion &amp; damage control for Tom King's sake. He revealed himself as a gigantic asshole recently. Of course, I had my doubts about the guy when he started claiming Trump was part of a Russian FSB Manchurian Candidate-like operation. Makes my head hurt.
Screw this ! And you trump!
I mean I was skeptical but tried to give Trump a clean slate... nope
No surprise there the script that was written for him to read off ,That question evidently wasn‚Äôt anticipated So when in doubt ‚Äúrun trump run‚Äù
For that matter, let me know when you find any evidence that Biden has made inappropriate sexual comments about his own daughter, as Trump has. Or when 24 women are saying Biden raped or sexually assaulted them, like Trump has.
Now as far as "shouldn't be left alone around children," please let me know when Biden is being sued for raping a 13 year old like Trump was in 2016, or when Biden bragged about deliberately walking in on underage beauty contestants to see them nude.
Trump can't win on policy or leadership. He has neither. He's a blathering idiot who can probably barely tie his own shoes or use the potty on his own. He's losing by a wider margin every day. And you think that pretending that Biden has Trump's problems is a winning strategy. ü§£
Thanks, expose Trump for what he is
Projection of Trump's character flaws onto Biden has been a losing strategy for your bunch from the start, but please keep up the good work of helping Trump lose. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yep, Trump even said they were good people. A disgusting double standard. Thanks, for saying what a lot of people were thinking
One-on-one with President Trump
The guy didnt know where he was the other day. He's confused his wife and his daughter and cant speak an unaided complete sentence.  Hate Trump all you want but this will be even worse. He won't complete 1 term much less 2. Watch the debates...if they don't try to cancel

Let's face it! trump's idea of a suburb is somewhere on the outskirts of the Hamptons.
My deal is get trump  out.
Well, I live in the suburbs, and I have some diversity in my neighborhood.   My question is why does Trump think that affordable housing is a problem? Furthermore, why did he pull "Cory Booker" out of a hat today as the person who would run it? Booker was perplexed, too.
They hate the same things the Trump hates. This makes them believe he is good as they have the same person or group to blame. Typical cult operations.
In a tweet Wednesday, President Donald Trump associated low-income housing in suburban areas with a rise in crime and backed a previously announced order to rescind an Obama-era rule meant to reduce bias in public housing access.
There is no difference between Trump and Biden... if you think there is you are deceiving yourself

Huh. So apparently the Trump-loving Russian Twitter bots are now Packers fans too.
President Donald Trump's decision to pull nearly 12,000 US troops from Germany triggered an onslaught of disapproval from Republicans, Democrats and former senior military officials, who said the move will benefit Russia, and cost US taxpayers billions.
This is murder. Some people hate Trump so much, they‚Äôd rather people die than ever admit Trump was right about hydroxychloroquine. They‚Äôd rather stand in the way of a potential end to what they perceive as a politically advantageous pandemic.

Trump still has a ~70-80% approval rating with Republicans, and I think he surely will go on a war path dragging down the Lincoln Project if they try to rejoin the Republican Party. It's still his party even if he lost the center.
It shows how willing Trump is to hear all sides of the story.

President Trump Takes Historic Action to Reduce Prescription Drug Prices  via
If we do a nation-wide lockdown for 4-6 weeks, we could finally break out of this COVID19 cycle. Just had a terrible thought: there's no way Trump would do this until it would interfere with the Presidential Election.
Come on man use your brain just a tad bit!  Oh wait its a worldwide conspiracy....every single country in the world is lying &amp; most of all they‚Äôre lying because they dont like Trump! Apply the common sense you gained in 2nd grade!  If you‚Äôre to scared to wear the mask stay home!
Poetry  Lol, you have no rebuttal to their post do you? Trump is about as far from Christian values as you can get.
Trump was the one who liked to count other POTUS golfing trips.   Now he has way way surpassed Obama's trips in his 8 years in only his 3 and a half years..look it up! Trump's idea!
shit dude your guy was way worse than trump
I know Trump has terrible standards but Reagan??
God only knows what ‚ÄúTrump focusing on the issues‚Äù will look like
I keep seeing the same rhetoric that Democrats are all baby killers but it‚Äôs Trump and the GOP saying the schools have to reopen. Seems to me the only people trying to kill our babies are the Republican party. #COVID„Éº19
Hating Trump is common on both sides and i know a few republicans that absolutely despise him but are still going to vote for him because fuck Biden and fuck neoliberals  Which is hilarious because many on The Left feel similarly but have come to opposite conclusions
My hot take is that  is delaying the release of their Presidential race model because it has a a really low chance of a Trump win. But I don't know, that's just my guess. I've noticed them updating their polling model at weird times when there weren't new polls.

I don‚Äôt understand at all these Trump people with there America BS but this man went to WAR just to get pepper sprayed by secret police!?  Did they any America to be great!?! What even is this
The fact you took the time to post between ‚ÄúYour and You‚Äôre‚Äù shows you don‚Äôt have a life I easily see why.  All I stated was Trump supporters worked as well. Probably more of them. Read original tweet.
I understand he stoops to solicit favor from the most heartless of leaders but this is Trump‚Äôs most offensive curtsy yet
It's like they're trying to create an iconic moment when Biden has the Trump wall torn down
I especially like the blonde gum chewing robot that goes into the White House. She reminds me of Ivanka Trump!
I used to think Trump had a certain level of instinct that would propel him forward in a strategic direction when the going gets tough, but now I see he simply stumbled into the presidency because of the right economic conditions and utter disdain for the govt corruption.
It‚Äôs only gotten ugly Bc of Trump Derangement Syndrome. The left and the never-trumpers hate trump more than they like America.
Sanders gaslighting his supporters is a new level of commitment to defeat Trump. I wish he had that same commitment during his campaign against Biden. You don‚Äôt have to lie about Biden and his platform. Just say Trump is dangerous. That‚Äôd be enough for me. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Terrific look at the US pandemic response through the lens of NTSB aviation accident reporting. There was nothing ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù or unforeseen about this; quite the opposite. The Trump admin actively created this through mismanagement, myopia, and just not wanting to be bothered
Your ignorance is astounding. Carlin was speaking about the system &amp; how both parties cater to the billionaires and Wall Street while ignoring the needs of the people. Carlin‚Äôs words can just as easily be used against Biden‚Äôs record as they can Trump, as well as your ignorance.

No it's not. It's been proven successful in multiple states. Trump even did it. Prove that it's easier to get away with fraud with mail in ballots. You can't.
Well, Trump broke Reagan‚Äôs 1st commandment many times: he speaks ill of any Republican it suits him to clobber.
I have a Trump joke, but it got impeached
Your beloved Trump voted by mail, you delusional hypocrite.   Mail-in ballots are about making elections fair for all, ESPECIALLY during a pandemic. Being able to take off work to vote in a line less than 2 hours long is a luxury not afforded to all and is used to suppress voters
What even is this supposed Obamagate? And why does it come up every time someone points out a terrible thing that Trump has done as if that would somehow invalidate it? Of all the mental gymnastics you have to do to support Trump, this concept has to be one of the dumbest.
Feds be very careful...they wanna be victims. "Military" people that are not Americans by the oath they swore. Renounced it by deed, IMHO.  Can they drag this out for 100+ days? Want a video to make Trump "evil bad guy" to shill to normies at home under lockdown.
She‚Äôs an antifa/blm anarchist that broke through a barrier and attempted to damage Federal property. She‚Äôs being arrested..as she should. I hope and pray that this truly IS Trump‚Äôs America. We are all doomed otherwise. The ‚Äúreign of terror‚Äù is coming from BLM/Antifa/Leftists/Dems
Hope you all enjoyed your Covid shutdown break, back to it.
I've got a Trump joke, but it's not really that clever.

Pres. Trump is recycling the sales pitch of a 60s suburban real estate agent, and he has the same goal: SCARE white people.   I can‚Äôt believe anyone, let alone the president, can get away with saying this in 2020.   Blatantly racist.

Donald Trump is ghosting me.

I'm waiting for Biden to be asked if he took the same test as Trump and have him answer, "My doctors have not suspected that I am suffering from dementia and therefore haven't given me any tests to check for mental impairment."
That‚Äôs true. He did say that he lied about masks to prevent the healthcare workers from running out of them. Another reason why I am losing trust in the health ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. But notice how Dr. Fauci is being lauded by the left for going against Trump but Dr. Birx isn‚Äôt. Narrative.

But for how long will you vote Democratic? A one-off vote for Biden is not going to be enough to turn this country around and mend all the damage done by Trump, Bush 2, and Reagan.
One way to ü§ê Meghan McCain is to ask the blunt question: "Do you support President Trump and his policies? Keep it short." All I see coming from her is an effort to remain visible. She wants to attach to her father's legacy but her manner/methods not compatible with his.
President Trump is running the NHS?
What happened when Hillary lost? Have the democrats accepted Trump's win.  How about doing some real reporting and not just spewing partisan dribble.
4 more years of Tr*mp: if he gets another term he gets at least 1 more scotus appointment. No one can expect RBG to stay after this, her retirement is long overdue and she deserves rest. But Trump's justices aren't really into the whole "protecting rights" thing. so there's that.
As someone who is from Boone County, it‚Äôll be probably be red. Lots of sad trump supporters there.

My child.  You just made my point.  Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. Actual American voters rejected him as a sexist, racist, xenophobe by a huge margin. Thank you for agreeing with me.  And, again, I'm glad Joe Biden has been called out by Democrats.
By the City, County, State, then the federal government. You're OK with Trump sending in federal agents to protect citizens from people committing misdemeanor crimes? Come on. How does that make any sense? The right always bitches about states rights, where are they now?
Sweetums, you're wandering again. The topic is Trump's decades long record of racism and xenophobia, even while he's been President. Focus, darling!  Now, be gone. You aren't interesting.  Do remember that Obama ran with Joe. He would never run with Trump.
Trump using this law only shows he's just as corrupt. So the blame can't just go to Obama. They'd both equally suck as ppl and one right now one of those ppl needs to be stopped cause he's out of control.
2/2  . . .real, wrongly accused black children that Trump wanted killed. He took out a full page ad in the NY Times  demanding the death penalty. He never apologized. In 2011 Obama's limited restrictions were in response to a known domestic threat. He did not ban all Muslim entry
1/2 Pookie, are you not aware that Trump challenged Obama's birth country as the U.S?  He said he even had investigators looking into it (on camera!).  Fred and Donald Trump were sued by the Justice Department in 1973 for housing discrimination. The Central Park 5 were. . .
Enjoy 4 more years of Trump bud üòÇTrump2020 ‚úäüèª
You didn't include all the facts, though. You left out birtherism, the housing discrimination lawsuits, the Central Park 5, his campaign announcement speech, the Muslim ban. . . . So much more.  He's a racist xenophobe. Trump, not Baio.

I think we‚Äôre all familiar with the idea something really unlikely can happen like Trump winning an election
Theory: Democrats enable Trump‚Äôs behavior by expanding his powers, giving him more funding, &amp; removing restrictions so he can destroy his chances of re-election by abusing those powers. Thoughts?

Donald Trump is exceedingly proud that he took a cognitive functioning test. Seriously, way super excited cantstoptalkingaboutit proud.
Trump wants 4 more years so he can line his and his families pockets full of tax payer and government money. That's his sole reason for wanting to be president. You folks need to wake up and see what he's doing you, us, everyone!!
I can‚Äôt wait for Biden‚Äôs administration. I just hope when it happens that everyone that shouts ‚ÄúTrump is worse‚Äù are the ones that also demand en masse for Biden to do better. I have no faith in that tho. They‚Äôll become complacent &amp; forget about the people‚Äôs suffering.
Art of the Deal, a 1986 expose in New York Magazine and this fucking test will be the sole contents of the the Donald Trump Presidential Library.You know I love you Nate but you missed it on this one. You had a man who wanted to make a statement by attending Trump's rally &amp; not wearing a mask, and it backfired on him. He is literally now dead.
So let‚Äôs get this straight. Trump says is ok to reopen schools putting millions of children, teachers and staff at risk but now suddenly feels election should be put on hold until we can all go out safely to vote in person. #TrumpThreatensAmerica #TrumpIsALaughingStock #Vote2020
And how many of those folks attended Trump's rally in Tulsa? How many of those folks bragged about being out not wearing masks because it's a hoax?  This is as simple as reporting facts and you are turning this around on other people attending rallies regarding social injustice?
Speaking of frauds, where is your cofounder, Ryan?

Obama didn‚Äôt give us Trump, Hillary did. Had Obama been eligible to run for reelection he would have trounced Trump as badly as he did McCain
Trump is responsible for 152,000 American death, including Cain‚Äôs.  His refusal to act until it was too late and his insistence on opening up too early combine with his failure to get testing supplies, which is no accident, as he said Slow the testing down please.
Trump is the human equivalent of a Feringi, he has no honor
In the meantime, on Jan 20, 2021 we have a new POTUS because Trump‚Äôs term ends!
Too many people are voting for Biden for all the wrong reasons. I can respect you if your reason is because you are (rightfully) afraid of what Trump is capable of, based on the shit that is happening in Portland and NY right now.
Pompeo is as dirty as Trump!
Watching this  speech and I can‚Äôt help but think, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a less eloquent Trump with worse hair.‚Äù And I gotta say, if that‚Äôs what MJF was going for on #AEWDynamite he nailed it.
Def not written by Trump. With the exception of the odd break at the end, the sentences actually make sense!  Must have been an aide writing this (or at a minimum, telling him to say).
Spoken like a young Donald Trump.
Pompeo is one of many GOP happy to cheat to keep trump in power because they‚Äôre gone when trump‚Äôs gone.
Obama is a great public speaker. Trump is not, at all, but Trump gets things done for us all.

Sorry not sorry to tell y‚Äôall but Jesus would NEVER be a Trump supporter, I said what I said. Read the Bible or know the basic tenants of Christianity, fools.
&amp; the way you‚Äôre talking, you obviously worship Trump more than you love God. Bc God would care about the sick &amp; dying, the poor, those suffering from a racist system. Trump just has you close your eyes to all these situations. You‚Äôve made him a false idol.
&amp; no I‚Äôm not a Democrat or Republican frankly I‚Äôm not a fan of either side rn. But it‚Äôs not an agenda. We‚Äôre trying to save ppls lives &amp; end the suffering in America. We are in this BS bc of Trump &amp; his incompetence. He‚Äôs only been successful in mind controlling idiots.
Additionally, how do you even know he's a democrat? He is calling out ONE person, as am I - not calling out a whole party or declaring for one. I'm not a democrat, but I can't believe how transparent this attempt to keep power is. You old farts just ride or die for Trump.
Vicky, can you just attempt to not sound ridiculously stupid? If Dems were in Trumps position you wouldn't accept this - admit it. If polls showed trump up by 15% you wouldn't be trying to delay. You didn't care about Russia and know literally nothing about mail in voting.
People are fed up‚Äîwith trump and his assault on our values and democracy.
Think Trump will go to his funeral? That would be quite some photo op, memorializing your buddy who died specifically because they took your bad advice

Trump can post whatever wild nonsense on Twitter that comes to his addled mind but he has no authority to postpone the election
Just gonna point out that Trump, Pence, Barr, and almost every person of power in his administration have voted by mail.

Any ‚Äúrepublican‚Äù against Trump is meaningless war loving Bush fanboy who shouldn‚Äôt be trusted.
If the majority of the American people can stop and think they will see that everything Trump is doing and had done is for them Trump will be reelected but if the Democrats can succeed in making a majority of the American people forget that fact Biden will be the next president!

Trump, Barr, and the GOP present antifa as a major threat in the US, but they're not killing people ‚Äî unlike white supremacists
If Republicans don't get a damn backbone they will lose the Senate and the White House President Trump can't do it all on his own
part of the problem with seeing Trump all the time is normalizing the speed he answers questions. Here, Joe takes a considerable amount of time before giving a thoughtful answer, but the pause feels long because we're used to Trump's rush to hear his own voice again.
Every single one of the Democrats in this committee are political hacks hell bent on destroying the country and Donald Trump just to win power back.
So Mr. Trump how does it feel to be by far the worst President of the United States in history? You make Nixon look Good WOW!
A sign they think trump is going down but they hope to save GOP seats?  Trump couldn‚Äôt have done so much damage without his GOP enablers.
If anything, recent events have shown us that Democrats, and subsequently, Biden, don't care about the people. All they care about is getting Trump out of office. It just so HAPPENS that getting Trump out of office benefits the people, but that is not their purpose for doing it.
Dems ignoring and supporting riots across the country yeah. Y‚Äôall gonna make me vote Trump. Didn‚Äôt learn in 2016 so hope you like losing. Disappointed in you Andrew.

Like, holy shit. It feels like because it's SO HARD to be "as bad" as Trump is right now (and trust me, it is getting really bad), they're using that as a way to be as shitty and immovable policywise as they can. No M4A in the middle of a fucking pandemic???
Okay, this is another hearing where the GOP is not interested in getting at the facts. They and AG Barr work for Trump not the American people. So, I may as well mute them. It‚Äôs just like every hearing we have observed!Vote BLUE up and down !
Trump is a snake oil salesman.  He doesn‚Äôt care if the snake oil works, he just wants you to buy it.
Yes, they are doctors, that doesn‚Äôt make them experts. What is their motivation for doing this exactly? There is no need to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù a drug that doesn‚Äôt have reliable results. To insist it was thrown out because ‚Äúlol fuck trump‚Äù is asinine.  Grow up.
Trump is stuck with 29,000,000 doses.  He wants to make a sale, and he doesn‚Äôt care if it kills his supporters.

Hey man, Ivanka is still doing well and trump touches her all the time!

I understand your disappointment, but the truth is that Bernie was never going to defeat Trump.  I was excited about Hilary, but she was the wrong choice.  We need a winner.  Bernie is supporting Joe.  Please help us get Trump out of office.

Just read your tweet. Such vitriol. Obviously a Trumper. Good luck, my friend, in all you do or try to do. And yes, I do think a lot of myself. Don't you? Or is it just Trump?
Is trump signing his resign letter?
When trump says his supporters have more enthusiasm than Biden‚Äôs, he clearly underestimated how much we want him out of office and in prison with the rest of his crime family.
If mayors would do their jobs then trump wouldn‚Äôt have to step in. But guess you love watching people kill each other in the streets.
Where did you get the idea I'm voting for Trump?
You sound absolutely insane - just as crazy as Trump. This is why everyone labels liberals as snowflakes/libtards. With eveything going on in this country THIS is what you're pissed about? Who cares who he golfs with? I'd wager you don't know Favre personally, right?
Exacrly. Unfortunately though that‚Äôs kinda on par for the trump administration. I wish I can say I was surprised about them being deployed.
The real ‚Äúsilent majority‚Äù are the many Americans who can‚Äôt stand Biden and will be bullying him to the left (even if we‚Äôre skeptical) if he wins, but will voting for him to stop Trump as damage control. The left movement isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
I think a presidential election is the wrong time to try this out. If the election is close and one or two states are going to determine the outcome, it's possible we wouldn't know the result until days or even weeks after election day. This would give Trump room to question it.
As trump creates violence for photo ops to use as ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs America,‚Äù do all his campaign advisors think voters are so dumb they don‚Äôt know who the president is.  Dems should be airing photos of trump‚Äôs America where moms and veterans are gassed and shot.
And pay attention- Trump has cut the budget this year to the post office and the mail is slowing as a result. He is doing this to invalidate mail in vote
and they will continue to be whether it's Trump or Biden as president
Yes, because he's an alternative that I'm willing to consider. Anyone would be better than Trump. Even another creepy white man.
The pro mask mandate side includes Trump, Republican and Democrat governers, the Mayo Clinic and most if not all infectious disease physicians.. trying to get a handle on who the non maskers are putting faith in
The devestating result of trump‚Äôs malignant incompetence in refusing to act while ignoring warnings, throwing out the pandemic playbook, and trying to figure out how to profit from the virus has made the US a poster boy of What Not to Do in a Pandemic.  Republicans, fix your mess
With past white moderates, at the very least they are willing to be lenient with citizens because (again, unfortunately) our govt treats citizens far better than foreigners for the most part. Trump, however, doesn't care if you're a citizen. You're the enemy if you disagree.
Me either. A man is measured by the people he surrounds himself with. Brett Favre and Donald Trump??? During a pendamic? On our $$$ all memorabilia in the trash along w him.
However, from a perspective of doing the most good in an immediate sense, then unfortunately voting for Biden is the choice that makes the most sense from a consequentialist perspective given the profound violations of the rights of American citizens that Trump had perpetuated
Ahhh, I knew I sensed sarcasm. The Trump photo as a boxer though! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ These people are fucking delusional in all aspects, my God.
Your are SO right,  Trump!!   YOU will not rename the bases. But Congress and President Biden WILL.
It‚Äôs so insane how he does these things and ~nobody~ actually checks him. Politicians just say ‚Äúyeah fuck Trump‚Äù to try to relate to us and make us feel safe when our lives are literally in danger. I‚Äôll never get over this shit.

I suspect that some of those immigrant children who just disappeared from where they were stolen from their parents were sex-trafficked by people with connections to this administration.  Trump has relationships with pedophiles.  Something to look into.

Everyone on here needs to chill out. This is why no one takes liberals seriously, and calls us libtards, etc (and I AM liberal). Say whatever you want about Trump, but Brett Favre is not under any obligation to the country not to golf.
I swear to everything holy that if Joe Biden is fairly elected the POTUS I will accept that victory in the exact same manner that the Democrats accepted Donald Trump. I swear. Because I'm a giverü§£
No! Was scared to death country would fall apart economically before OBAMA was OUT of office. Since Trump's BEEN IN office, economy turned around. No longer fear economic annihilation. UNEMPLOYMENT rate's LOWEST it's been in DECADES, esp for blacks, yet MANY don't appreciate it.
The divide between President Trump and local leaders in places where he has deployed federal agents is widening.
What an idiotic response.  Trump is  a professional and this whole subject is a reflection of a few idiotic personel the likes of Pelosi would actually push proving she's and absolute idiot!
Idiotic.  This was all tongue in cheek.  Trump is a professional.  This whole subject is foolish.
All they had to do to please trump was to let their citizens get sick and die.
He earned my vote, unfortunately, by being the only realistic way to prevent another four years of Trump's fascistic impulses. That's it. Other than that, he's a trash candidate and a disgusting person who has perpetuated and enabled oppression for decades.
Every single city that is having major crime problems, that they obviously can't handle themselves, should ask for federal help to stop it.  But that would make Trump look good.  We can't let Trump look good can we? üòÇ
When Trump wins re-election it will be glorious.   #TrumpNowMoreThanEver2020  #liberalTears #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
‚ÄúAccepting this type of ‚Äòoccupation‚Äô of American cities by unidentified federal agents requires such an extreme level of dehumanization of the citizens"
Trump thinks he can manipulate women in the suburbs the same way Nixon did because he lives in the past and doesn‚Äôt realize the world has changed.
Trump didn‚Äôt save millions of lives by shutting down flights from China.  He still allowed business travel, but the real problem was all the infections coming in from Europe.
According to right wing media the CDC, Democrats, the media, and doctors are all lying about the effect of COVID 19 in order to destroy the economy thereby hurting Trump at the polls. Anyone who believes that is either on drugs or needs psychiatric help
For all the idiots in the comments complaining about propaganda for trump just don‚Äôt riot and then he can‚Äôt call you rioters. If the local officials would protect their people and buildings the Feds wouldn‚Äôt have been called in. But keep starting fires that‚Äôs how you‚Äôll win ü§°ü§°
Wow rich people hangout in the same spots. You‚Äôve really proved a point. Just mad cause Elon can talk to Trump.
I'm not concerned. If Trump loses the election and responds by bringing 70,000 paramilitary mercenaries to defend him in the White House, every one of them would be dead or incarcerated within two days
That's still more training than Trump has ever gone through as POTUS. Yeesh. Minimum wage workers during a pandemic have to take training to learn how to deal with Trump supporters/Covid-19 deniers. Are you guys ashamed yet? Fucking pathetic. Just do your part and shut up, ffs.

Trump‚Äôs tryna talk tough and Davey just wants to Bullshit. I kept waiting for him to offer Trump a slice of pizza or something. üòÇüçï #DDTG
I just look at trump support signs as equal to kkk hoods; they‚Äôre just more public about it.
Trump's economic record was stellar before the pandemic. Nobody could've stopped this outcome of job losses from the mass closing of businesses to mitigate it . You either close the economy to save lives or you sacrifice the lives to save the economy. You can't have it both ways.
Can you tell us what's egregious, Mike? Could it be the federal agents sent in to arrest and hold protestors much like you'd see in authoritarian countries? Also, shame for seeing this as a political issue that could help Trump get reelected
Oh sure. Like schools aren't being forced to open by Trump and DeVos. üôÑ
Honor, decency, respect, truth, honesty:  5 words trump can‚Äôt remember.
They were attacked the by the Trump SS
First of all. What a hateful and ignorant use of language.  Second, it does not solve the fact that this clip has nothing to do with BLM. Nothing. Not even the same country.  This is like when the trump capamaign released an ad using foreign revolution footage to demonize BLM
I won't be voting for him or Trump.  Spare me the whole "election of our life time" garbage, hear it every 4 years.  Biden said back in 2012 that Romney would put blacks back in chains...  I'm looking for a party that wants to represent me, not the lesser of 2 evils.
In accordance with the stellar leadership that Chicago routinely demonstrates, they have now shifted from solely blaming Trump, to also blaming Indiana and Missouri for the illegal arms in their city. Oh, and they blamed poverty.
Credit to  for giving me a dose of reality with the real life stuff that has been happening which I haven't paid attention to. I have been ignoring Trump for my own mental health and that was a mistake.
I will never pretend that Biden will be a good president. I will never pretend that Biden is a good person. I will still criticise him just as much. Unfortunately, the damage Trump can and will do is much greater of a threat than Biden's damage. It sucks, but that's how it is.
So, I have come to the conclusion that while I stand EXTRAORDINARILY in opposition to everything Joe Biden stands and has stood for. However, I would be hard pressed to say the harm done by a Biden presidency would ever compare to the harm Trump has the potential to propagate.
The quran predicted trump!
Trump:  Testing is over rated. Also Trump:  I passed the test!  I‚Äôm cognitively there!
Really? You think that‚Äôs embarrassing? Go look at Trump‚Äôs shit. You‚Äôll probably cough up a lung
So now you will follow POTUS? I thought you were a sanctuary state that would never follow the poor leadership of Donald Trump. BUT now you need his leadership.
Trump tweets to suburban moms that Portland‚Äôs unrest is what they‚Äôll get back.  Suburban moms yell Biden won‚Äôt teargas or shoot us!
I don‚Äôt know why Russian hackers would hack into Covid research when trump would gladly hand them any info they asked for.  But maybe he was too incompetent to carry that out, and Putin had to do it himself.
Trump might feel deflated to know I‚Äôm given such a test once a year as part of my wellness exam, and that I get his ‚Äútough‚Äù memory question (the one he rambled on about) right and in order each time.  And I‚Äôm a mere woman. üòè
Trump offers to send help to big cities to help stop all the crime, people and kids getting murdered like crazy.  The Dems in control there don't want his help. If Obama had done this, they'd accept it with open arms and say he's the greatest president ever.  Amazing!
Yeah it was wrong then, and it‚Äôs wrong now. Trump still peddles that theory to this day! You have no right to take the moral high ground here.
Trump isn‚Äôt the mayor of those cities. If he was I‚Äôm sure the riots wouldn‚Äôt still be going on.
Trump carries them in his pockets.  Fortunately, they‚Äôre so tiny that they don‚Äôt weigh him down.
‚ÄúThe virus ran its course‚Äù? Yeah, that‚Äôs why numbers are skyrocketing back to where they were at the beginning of April in places that have pushed to reopen. Look at Texas, Florida, Indiana‚Äôs newest numbers. Do some basic research and stop spreading bullshit you heard from Trump.
The weird mental deficiency that Trump's supporters seem to universally have is alarming. Like, you can't pass the buck to someone who isn't even in fucking office. Even if they're saying that everything that's going on is a result of Obama/Biden's policies, that's way off base.
We're so quick to blame our issues on a particular president (don't get me wrong Trump has exacerbated it for sure) but America isn't dying because of the one dude that we've had as president for four years.
Trump brings on the police state when q theories said he would dissolve the police state. Interesting
Actually, Bill Barr was first to want to defund the police.  He didn‚Äôt use that term but threatened to remove police protection from areas that weren‚Äôt respectful to them.  And of course trump has been defunding the police by not paying the security costs in areas he rallies.
Indiana‚Äôs gov. announced mask requirement beginning Mon.  The unmasked were marching on the statehouse to protest, and nobody was grabbed off the street and whisked off in a van.  In trump‚Äôs America it‚Äôs cool to protest masks but criminal to protest murder.
Matt Gaetz grew up in the Truman House. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd let his buddy trump borrow it
Just like trump.
I saw a clip of the interview, and he said Dr. Ronny gave him the test.  He hasn‚Äôt been around for 2 years, but trump acts like it just happened, which maybe he thinks it did, which means he is deranged.

No Biden has no point and Trump isn‚Äôt a racist.
Reason being, is that by doing it annually from age 65 or so forward, doctors are able to catch the signs of cognitive decline earlier because they have a baseline to work from. My point was regarding Trump, is that it isn‚Äôt an IQ test.
Trump is gonna win in a landslide. The focus needs to be getting the house back and getting rid of Pelosi and her gang.

How? It‚Äôs all baseless nonsense. Just kids of 4chan pretending to work for the government and speak in code.  And now they‚Äôve built an army of trump zombies that is likely the product of a Russian disinformation campaign.
Then why so many meeting (and subsequent indictments)? Why did trump black every man woman and child he could from testifying? Why is he feeling people with filthy backgrounds who plead guilty?  Lemme guess, an elaborate liberal coup b/c butthurt about election?  Source: BBC
It hasn‚Äôt been proven as a hoax, that‚Äôs just what trump likes to say. Clearly nothing sarcastic about your previous comment either.  You can stop screaming now.
OMG .  He got it under control, unlike trump or the red state gobs. who let it surge out of control.  Why is Rand Paul pro-Covid?  Could it be because Putin likes a sick and dying America?

And throw the clintons in jail if they‚Äôre guilt no democrat would defend them.  Meanwhile people break themselves in half to protect trump from this Epstein business when he was a close friend and neighbor of theirs.  Q puts blinders in trumps crimes intentionally. Wake up
Epstein my guy. Biden didn‚Äôt roll with Epstein who had a child sex ring. I don‚Äôt care if joe isnt squeaky clean (find a politician who is) but he‚Äôs has 1/25 the number of rape allegations as trump and wasn‚Äôt close friends with known child traffickers.
You didn‚Äôt hear?   Trump is mobilizing Gundam
Nah it means if you still support Trump then blatant racism isn‚Äôt a breaking point for you... so you‚Äôre racist. If you support him, you openly support racism &amp; his racist actions.
Q‚Äôs foundation is a lie, my dude. That someone inside the trump organization is leaking trump/republicans agenda to take down deep state democrats? Please.  Q is a nobody, not the next Edward Snowden and his ideas are easily debunked. Occam‚Äôs Razor‚Äîthe simplest is most often true
It‚Äôs exaggeration most often. There are facts, but they are sometimes used in deceptive ways to make a point.   However, when trump is taking apart our justice department to protect himself from prosecution, it is not lies, nor is it alarmist. Democracy IS at risk right now.
Agree. Our American service members have the right to refuse a command. The terrorists in uniform are a group formed by Trump. ü§¨
Game over: President Trump sending federal police throughout country to end riots, take back America
I mean theres no way he could be president! If trump takes this much heat and he has no history saying hes bi polar but If someone mentioned how hes not qualified they're automatically racist smh
And Trump is right.
QAnon is certifiably a pro-trump conspiracy group. So them talking a ‚Äútruth and ‚Äúsheep‚Äù so much is both wrong and deeply ironic. And given that trump is barely a conservative and more a far right wannabe dictator, that is the ideology of Q, like it or not.
So someone just called up at my job because my brother has a trump flag in the back of his truck and said that he needs to take it down because its racist so my boss was like how is that racist so she said hes racist for asking how it was?

Trump has handled coronavirus and the protests (and riots) correctly, at least for the most part.Damn...Trump team is pulling out all the oldies
It was televised on major networks. What an immature imbecile. If they were at the funeral that‚Äôs where they should have remained. BTW THE SPEECHES AND Obama‚Äôs eulogy were so outstanding they make trump sound like a bumbling, mumbling idiot.
What right/authority does trump have to build multiple fences around the WH turning the people‚Äôs house into a fortress?
But they put money in the covid bill for remodeling the west wing, fighter jets, etc. to sabatage the bill because they don‚Äôt want it to pass. Anyone who votes for trump is voting against their best interests.

I mean, Trump never actually does anything. He just tells people to. He doesn't have the official power to delay the election, but if he demands it be delayed, people will have to choose how to respond. I'm not saying it will happen, I'm mostly confident it won't.

Tom Cotton SAYS slavery was a ‚Äúnecessary evil‚Äù to build this country. Trump has made it acceptable to be racist.this country doesn‚Äôt need them in leadership positions. breeding, buying and selling of slaves, raping, splitting up families have to do w/building country. PURE EVIL
I cannot wait for the Nov election. I am so tired of trump blaming everyone and everything for the inability of his administration to deal with the economy, the virus and the fact that he cannot admit the fact that he He was more important than the lives of our citizens.
Him: "Nawl, I get that He is going through a lost (yes, He said that.) but He just being weird."  He is about as dumb as Trump, He don't even know how to show empathy, but want to argue about losing a child?! Nigga, you still have YOUR CHILD, He lost one of His!
I have a tRump wall joke but it just falls flat.
Donald Trump Is the Best Ever President in the History of the Cosmos

Why isn't this being done in the other cities Trump has threatened?
If we don't fight this, and I'm including Governors and state legislators, we will find ourselves with an authoritarian government!
Facebook profits by spying on us and using the data to let advertisers target us. Trump is exploiting their model to spread lies about elections ‚Äî it‚Äôs time to investigate #Facebook and rein this in.

With the need to quarantine with exposure one sick child closes the school down again. One infected substitutes closes down multiple schools. Yes it‚Äôs a horrible dilemma, but consider why we are here at this point...trump! His ordering otherwise won‚Äôt cover that up.

Trump has no other skills so his last resort is to attempt to run the country by fear, bullying and physical force. He ignores court orders even from SCOTUS. IT IS WITIHIM REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS POWER TO STOP THIS BUT THEY WONT. THEY ARE LETTING TRUMP REDUCE THE COUNTRY TO RUBBLE.

Trump doesn't give a shit that the world is watching his secret police! he's the one that said the Chinese did well at Tiananmen Square massacre when the people were protesting . If Trump cared how America looked he wouldn't have made our democracy a joke! He's made America crap!

It‚Äôs no coincidence that the most openly racist parts of America voted for Trump and back republicans and will do so again.

I mean, Trump never actually does anything. He just tells people to. He doesn't have the official power to delay the election, but if he demands it be delayed, people will have to choose how to respond. I'm not saying it will happen, I'm mostly confident it won't.

The Press Secretary is paid by US taxpayers to answer questions posed by the media about the activities of the President and the administration. To act as a gaslighting, subject-changing campaign shill means that she is stealing that salary. Let her be paid by Trump‚Äôs campaign.

It's crystal clear she was installed for a reason. And covid was a big gift to her &amp; Trump in their plot to defund public schools &amp; privatize education. Trump had the Putin playbook well in advance of election and he knew who to put in key positions.
This is how the press should handle Trump now...stop the bullsh*t...confront him head on...call him on his sh*t...always
I think Putin has ordered Trump to call him every week and Putin tells him what to say.
I don't know anymore. Trump is using goons to tear gas and arrest peaceful protesters he calls "radical left mobs" then uses the footage for  propaganda videos. He can't be winning new voters right? Right?! Why do I feel like we're always one step behind this a**hole?
They want parents and teachers back to work so Trump's job numbers are better by election time. They don't care if kids get sick or die.
The bigger crime is you still getting away corruption and the 140+ covid#19 deaths. You should be ashamed  Karma! Baby, karma. Mr. Trump virus!
I will give Trump credit in that he has exposed a lot of folks for what they are. I've lost friendships and I'm not as bummed as I thought I would be.

AOC, Trump, Biden: Live 2020 Election Updates
Biden wouldn't throw away a pandemic plan (left to him by the previous, successful, president) without first establishing a new one.   Like, throwing away Trump's plan obviously would be ok, since 140k+ people have died.  I could come up with a better plan than "do nothing".

A collection of Chicago activist groups want a judge to block federal agents sent by President Trump from interfering in or policing protests, arguing in a lawsuit that the surge will inhibit residents' ability to hold demonstrations.
A judge ordered the release from prison, saying he believes the government retaliated against Cohen for writing a book about President Trump.
Please don't blame so much of what Trump is on his biggoted father. Many abused children grow up to be great people. Regardless of a man's up bringing, he can plow his on path. Donald is what he is because he chooses to be.
You mean in 2008... After that, Obama made us a laughing stock. A welcome mat... Trump fixed the problem when Obama and his husband left the building.

Did someone really convince trump that the coronavirus is a real issue or is a staffer going rogue...?
That's simply untrue. There is no guarantee that Trump will enjoy an electoral college advantage. It's very, very likely, but it's not guaranteed.
thank you Patriot Act!
Questions and answers about this unconventional, if not unprecedented, use of federal forces. Is it legal? What comes next?
And Trump looked absolutely pathetic while doing so ...the bar is so f*cking low for this guyThat would be the Trump Virus.
He is afraid trump will pin jfk assasination on him
One of them is not all of them... Learn to count. Use fingers if it's too challenging.  The contraction was LESS than predictions.  Trump trolled weak minded easily triggered people with his postponement tweet. It worked in spades!  Texas will be fine.  Look up the word Patriot!
Trump fucking pisses me off!!
Trump is a bull face liar!!  He must resign!!
Chris Pratt, he supports trump, that's him in the meme. Sorry I get triggered from celebrity trump supporters. They need blacklisted!!

You need to stop with your disingenuous rationalizing and normalization of Trump. Your complicity will follow you the rest of your life if you do not. Truly and absolutely haunting and horrifying.
If you could make the call what would you do about Trump at this point??

‚ÄúLeftist?‚Äù  You paint with a wide brush honey. I just don‚Äôt like jerks like Trump.

Trump is not tested multiple times a day.  There‚Äôs no clinical reason, or value, in performing the same test throughout the day.

The China Virus, fuck you trump!!!
Today‚Äôs press conference is a step toward damage control. Be honest Andy the press was talking about Trump accepting the November election results before the tweet and will long after the tweet all the way up to the election.
"China virus?"  Trump had to politicize Herman Cain's passing.
Your bro crush is really showing. I get it though because, well, based on his good looks he‚Äôs CLEARLY not a Trump. So where is Hunter? Judging on this side by side I‚Äôm guessing he is on his way to a photo shoot.

Wake up. That was the Hillary campaign.  It was proven long ago. Trump enjoyed tweaking Obama bc it got under the Deer Leader‚Äôs skin.
Seriously. Trump is doing everything he can to try and lose this election.
Lincoln jailed the journos too. Maybe Trump should do the same.
Trump will win election by a landslide, carrying the House and Senate all red to finally getting rid of swamp
Calling the elimination of voter suppression and racial bias in elections "divisive and partisan" is vintage Trump gaslighting. And I'm still trying to figure out how one nurses their own erection. That's some SERIOUS flexibility.
No idea how you went from Obama to Trump. Literally, no idea.
If he had, you would have whined that he had no right to be there. Lewis hates Trump. Not disturbing the setting was actually very adult. Unlike your idiocy
Yes he is losing all sense and cannot make sense more then one sentence. He will be removed and replaced as the Dems know he won‚Äôt beat Trump.
Don't you see why trump is spreading the virus, he's trying to cancel the vote? It‚Äôs Why he has a rogue group kidnapping/beating protestors, he is trying to create everything thing we fear. We must stop him. He is out of control. He is infecting us all!!
Yes we‚Äôve got ‚ÄúTrump education‚Äú Those that voted him in, have the rare ability to discern between right and wrong. Trump was right and Hillary was oh so wrong. Trump is still the right choice unless there‚Äôs a level headed dem candidate.
The entire state of Oregon votes by mail? That sounds blissfully wonderful, compared to standing in line for what was 90 minutes during the last Presidential election for me, as I recall.
This theory is not supported by the religiosity of the Trump base.  Could be that the impulse to idolize politicians comes from the same place that strong religious beliefs come from.
I still find it amazing that after Trump threatened Twitter and social media with an Executive Order that his Twitter account is still up. Were it my company and a President attacked free speech and my company, his account would be done - for good. Sends a strong message.
Herman Cain, though a Republican, is black. Donald Trump knows his base will not take allow him to honor a black man. Therefore he will not honor Herman Cain, but look for him to say something ignorant like "He went to his grave knowing masks caused this"
Donald Trump should resign. Pass it on.
Trump should EO voter ID
Yeah let's do that and martial law to end the riots. Go Trump!
I feel like Trump is playing games with us! He's putting so much on our plates and it's so overwhelming. We need to stop and regroup. We need to start a revolt! We need our voices heard! We must make trump resign!!
I'm calling it now. Trump will take Lindsay on a "golf trip" again this weekend and on Monday Lindsay will Tweet "I fully support president Trumps idea of delaying the election."
Kodak was the company who laughed at digital photography and called it a fad and nearly went bankrupt. They will make nothing that will help the country, but they and Trump who invested in Kodak knowing he would make this announcement, just made a tidy fortune.
Said it before and I'll say it again, Trump is a MASS MURDERER and we need to take measures to protect ourselves!!
In 14 days texas is going to regret allowing trump‚Äôs fundraiser. Lots and lots of dead cult members walking! He better not be allowed in Indiana.
I read early today he was doing better and then boom he's dead. I thought it was fake. I made the call he was going to die since that's how karma works, he let people down. The fundraiser trump had yesterday is going to kill trump!
Trump really thinks he‚Äôs king! Come on Americans, let‚Äôs dethrone him!
Was wondering Marianne, would it be wrong to believe trump could be dealing with rogue aliens on his side? I know there are things happening that are not what they seem! Why has he not gotten COVID19?
Just watch how many here will have the virus. This was a very sad event to do in the middle of a pandemic, in the worse hit location in the world! Wtf. Trump just infected a bunch of his cult followers so they can spread it. Why does he not get it??
Which he contracted at Trump‚Äôs failed Tulsa rally. Literally dying to own the Libs.
Don't be like trump and use comments like 'short bus' that degrade people with learning disabilities. If you are going to pretend to be better better and more educated than trump, don't use these kind of hurtful and bully-like comments.
Rolls of paper towels were distributed to these rich oil execs pictured here to help wipe the unending drool from their mouths as Trump guarantees that the rich get richer on his watch. Yet Republicans ignore all help for Americans during a pandemic he is doing nothing about.
The Trump followers can justify absolutely any horrific behavior or words. I had one troll try to explain to me that Auschwitz was totally understandable because the Jews agreed to get on the trains, they were not forced. I could not hit the Block button quick enough.

Yes, they were selfless and true heroes.  So how about you honor their legacy by trying to do the same?  Say SOMETHING a/b Trump‚Äôs idea of pushing back the election!!!

No. Just like when he ‚ÄúFirebombed‚Äù Michelle Obama‚Äôs vegetable garden shortly after taking the oath of office, POTUS Thin-Skin treating Germany and more specifically, Angela Merkel, with disdain. This is about non-Corrupt leaders saying‚ÄùNO‚Äùto Putin and pissing Trump off.

US has rightfully taken heat for COVID, but look at some of Europe‚Äôs mortality #‚Äôs: Spain: 10%, Italy &amp; France: 14%, UK: 15%(!). One thing Trump is actually right about is more testing = more reported cases. It‚Äôs also why the aggregate US mort rate is nearing 3% #actuarishtweet
Donald Trump is a great embarrassment to the USA. His response to Covid-19 is a great embarrassment to the USA.   Voting him out is not.
Correct me if i'm wrong but if an election gets delayed doesn't the Speaker of the House become interim president at the end of the incumbent's term?   So Trump wants President Pelosi?
Trump voters tied the fortunes of this country to an incompetent psycho- this is what happened. Eat it.
Is Trump now saying it isn‚Äôt safe to vote?
I want to thank this man for showing that not all of us pastors and theologians are wacked out, give me your money, Trump is Christ reborn wack jobs. Some of us take our faith and God's Word extremely seriously and know it is not to be mocked. Thank you sir!!
Trump sees the writing on the wall and is flailing.   Get out and vote and seal the deal to get him out of there.
By "looking pretty good" she means that its pretty clear Joe Biden is going to walk all over Trump on 11/03/.2020 without any delays in the election. She and her siccophant, mindless, spineless followers all become irrelevant on 11/03/2020 and not a day later!  Buh-bye Laura!!!
Is it coincidence that the day after I write a blog post advocating for voting by mail that Trump is now calling for a delay of the general election?
Please God, I pray Trump kicks a** again. Of course like those who promised to leave the country this is just another lie. The L is for lie.
Trump is the greatest threat to America in its history. Let‚Äôs ship him over to Russia come November so he can practice what he preaches. Vote him out.
Trump tweets threats to other countries and Twitter didn‚Äôt do anything about that either...
Are you really so naive to believe this is news? NEWSFLASH! people dont like Americans. This has been going on for decades. Bit since you brought it up, what should Trump do about it?
Dem here, but I actually remember watching a GOP debate featuring the second tier candidates in 2016 thinking I actually liked Lindsey Graham a bit.  He‚Äôs done a complete turnaround selling his soul for Trump like all the others (except Romney).  It‚Äôs very tragic and sad, really

Joe Biden's job will be easy. Just do the absolute opposite of whatever Trump did. We will have national allies again, we will beat this virus together, we will began to have equality for all, corporations will finally pay their share, and we can all sleep again. #Biden2020
Well he and Eric sit down with Golden Books like "See Trump Lose".  Eric sounds out the big words for him.  But his ADHD kicks in after like 2 minutes and then he has to find a women to bully, or a Republican to blackmail, or a felon to free on Fridays. Trumpers gonna Trump.
This one is easy. He is no longer president. Biden is and Biden then assumes military control just as Trump has. So Biden, smiling all the way, simply orders the military to throw him out. Any officer not following that order is guilty of treason. Period. This is a non-issue
Lets not forget that just last week the Head of the Policemens Union backed Trump.  They know more of this is on its way. Please note, there are still very amazing police men and women out there. WE must never forget that.
In a Covid hotspot in Texas, rich Republicans think they are immune to it. These people that end up with Covid and are in a hospital will need to vote by mail, if they are not dead. But Trump says no to mail voting. Hmmm. Is he hurting his own chances? He sure as hell is!!
Take it on TV or it didn't happen.  Same with Trump.
Putin just got serviced by Trump. #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing
Sadly more businesses will suffer because no one will have money to exist thanks to trump and republicans! Pandemic relief will never happen at this rate!!
If Trump thought he could make a dime off of it he'd be Tweeting it and buying stock in it right now
My spirit guides tell me this is what is taking place and to be ready for the change! Still it's hard to not hate trump! ü§≠
All I have to say is that the VP pick is very important this year because trump must be defeated. He must be defeated. We‚Äôve never had a leader who must be defeated.
On ‚ÄùQuora‚Äù I asked the question ‚Äùwho on here supports Trump?‚Äù It's so sad the answers I've read. I really thought people by now would be ashamed to admit it.
Twitter defends blocking Trump tweets but not Iran‚Äôs Ayatollah Khamenei
That is significant weakening. The remainder will be next if trump gets another term.
Seeing this shit pisses me and most normal Americans off. Trump landslide 2020.
Rob this is scary. We really need to come up with a counter defense council very soon. I think we should have a contest who knows the best way we can stop trump! Tired of watching this movie!

Hi there. I know President Trump has been at work getting rid of rebel scum in the riots, pedophiles and so on but will there be a morning when we wake up to mass arrests of traitors? What will it look like?
Support President Trump or get out of the way.
I think it‚Äôs likely to turn off the voters Trump is trying to sway. Yes, suburban (and other) housing policies can and are certainly racist in effect, if not intent, but most modern suburban voters aren‚Äôt going to embrace an overt appeal to racism aimed at them.
I might have to go back and watch ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù again. Martin Sheen should show Trump how to be a real president.
Trump knew about it and chose to ignore because Daddy Putin can do whatever he wants to our country!! Come on we need this fucker out today!!
1/Corrupt Bigoted Trump: It never ceases to amaze me how open you are about showing your true colors as a white supremacist. I live in the ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù in a wonderfully diverse neighborhood, where we welcome ANY person, no matter what ethnicity...
Because Trump feels he can buy anyone‚Äôs loyalty or blackmail them or publicly shame them or God knows what else... and he can because the Republicans have let him get away with everything. üò°
That is assuming that over half this country isn‚Äôt going to still vote for Trump.  They‚Äôre not investing in engaging new voters.  That means they know they have a lot of votes in the bag.
So what should happen to Barr? He clearly is doing illegal things with Trump and needs to be removed!!
Huh. I‚Äôm still not really sure what #TicTok is. I was told it‚Äôs just another version of Vine, but 2 billion downloads is huge. I‚Äôve read a few articles that disparage the app over data concerns which is never good. Guess I‚Äôll take a look later.
So Trump is disgusting but every NIMBY community (including mine) perpetuates the ongoing problem through local policy and action. How do we push things to change and get past our narrow self interests?
This might explain why Trump is pimping it.

So very swampy! Trump's campaign pointed out problems in our government, which were real and frustrating to many Americans. However, he had no interest in changing the problems, he just wanted the money to go him and his cohorts.
Barr must go!! Of course trump too!!

Every Republican should watch this to understand why people on the left see nothing but hypocrisy in Trump‚Äôs handling of different protests. Also remember that most protesters today are against police killing black people while the white protestors wanted to get haircuts
Trump has no consistency. #TrumpVirus
Trump invested in the drug manufacturer. With him, it‚Äôs all about his money.
Wait, are you implying Biden is in charge right now? He's the one overseeing the country eat itself apart? Or is it Trump fueling the protests with secret police and tear gassing people for photo ops? How deluded you have to be to think Biden has played any role in where this is
We have now reached the point that this guy is not the most insane doctor trump listens to.
No, Trump has integrity! I wouldn't attend either... The legacy is fake!
That is a the most hilarious thing I have heard in a long time. Clearly you were just a child and didn‚Äôt have to pay bills back then. Thankfully President Trump brought us back from eight years of Obama and Biden.

I think there's a lot of pressure to be the "first" in any big position like this. Like, Trump's general disapproval rating means we /probably/ won't see another celebrity populist make it super far for a while
you are absolutely right about everything you just said about Trump.
It gets better...One of the drugs for which Kodak will make ingredients is hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria medicine that President Trump has promoted as a treatment for COVID-19, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal.
No...maybe...but it sure the hell is for something that effects Trump. Does he own stock in Kodak?
Yeah, hiding in the basement and refusing to talk. That‚Äôs LEADERSHIP at its best. LOL. To be clear, I‚Äôm not defending Trump at all. I‚Äôm completely shitting on Biden.
Sure, why not? Just throw that on the pile of lawsuits amassing over there in the "Trump Corner"

First its to line his own pockets as he owns the fence building company. Why do you think he wanted to build a damned wall around Mexico in the first place? Simply to make money. Like all Trump projects, it is shoddy work and will fall if it ever even gets finished.
Biden and trump both will see the guillotines
Sad. An earlier article said that Barr and Trump had let on like they would be winding down the Portland "operation" by tonight. I guess that was just more lies. Oh well, the resistance will continue regardless of their lies. And we will catch it all on video as evidence.
Trump‚Äôs administration and his cult followers also spread virus misinformation. #TrumpVirus
They are oblivious because it doesn't fit their #1 agenda to destroy Trump.
It will be you Joe. No one in the current Administration wants the Act to be passed much less named after John Lewis, who Trump could not be bothered to pay respects to. Since he only respects his narcissistic self, he had no respects left to pay. #BidenLandslide2020
You‚Äôre as delusional as crooked Trump and crooked Barr!
As well as nearly EVERY Republican has for many years in the past. Trump put his lackey in charge of the USPS and he has slowed mail delivery to a crawl on purpose. Voter suppression is ALL they have left after the Graffiti Gestapo cost them polling points daily.
Trump is not a medical professional. I repeat, Trump is not a medical professional.
Ok so just make him watch the video with Trump saying that about ingesting bleach and just look at him and say - "Resign now. Your humiliated and a failure. Resign or be impeached." And have Jayapal say it!! I'll PAY to watch that. Pretty please!!!!
We don‚Äôt need Trump‚Äôs Gestapo terrorizing soccer Moms.
He clearly admits if Trump tells him to do something, he will do it, no matter how many laws he breaks to do it.
Most of what Joe will be saying in the near future will have these words in it "and reverse Trump's efforts to gut."Joe's entire first 2 years will be undoing what Trump destroyed. But he will have help, both at home, and abroad, as we re-unite and re-emerge as a World Leader.
Turns out, this is the most dangerous hoax in history. I'm talking about Trump, not Covid!
#TrumpVirus kills 150k+ Americans - Trump is clueless and has no plan for Covid - Trump enacts a witch doctor to do voodoo on anyone not supporting him - Even the Gestapo are said to be giving up on Trump - #TrumpMustResign #BarrMustResign
WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. The POTUS will not attend the visitation of John Lewis. John Lewis didn‚Äôt attend the Naugaration of Donald Trump. I don‚Äôt visit funeral homes or go to funerals to people I don‚Äôt care for. And everyone of you reading this do the same. That‚Äôs a Fact.
Ahh, so my assumption that Barr is as much of a narcissist as Trump was true all along. Deny, deny, blame everyone else, then claim you never even knew the thing happened. 11/03/2020 - the bell will toll for Trump and Barr.
That is the correct assumption of WW2. But the truth remains, you DID gas totally peaceful protesters so that Trump could get a picture in front of a church he was not welcome in holding a Bible upside down." Your a clown, and that was blasphemous as well as stupid.
Ahem, "After noticing that Trump has lost a grand total of 5 points in all national polls over the past week, we have decided that tear gassing Moms and Veterans is not working so we're taking our ball and going home." MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

You can post all the negative you want about ANY opponent of trump.  I‚Äôll still vote for an ashtray over President opposite.
They all feel empowered. As long as they protect Trump, there is a ‚ÄúGet out of Jail Free‚Äù card hot off the press.
Republicans know they will be taken down when trump goes. Trump has something on all those fuckers. A good chance a few democrats too. Congress will keep him in office and see the fall of our country to save their ass!!
What if we as a massive group all at once try to manifest the end of trump‚Äôs dictatorship? My spirit guides tell me every day this idea would work!! I don't think we have much time left if we don't do this soon!
Darren - If it took sports going away this year to get Trump out of the White House, would you want that to happen???
Aww...can we get  next? #TrumpLiesPeopleDie #TrumpLies #TrumpCrimeFamily
Does anyone feel like trump‚Äôs misfit army will start shooting people that can't afford their house payment and are being evicted but won‚Äôt leave? I can see that!! Soon enough people will be homeless if Trump continues!! Times are going to be like the great depression coming up!!
HILARIOUS! Donald Trump catches Chris Wallace and Proof Joe Biden wants ...  via
The air today smells a lot better. Hmm, I think there is less horseshit in the air.  Anyway this will give Donnie time to get his hydroQ intake since we now know that is the huge platform Trump is now running on - a failed drug sponsored by a witch doctor.
If trump retweets, it‚Äôs automatically fake.
Yang's been a lifelong democrat, he hates Trump, and always had nice things to say about Joe personally on the campaign trail. With all those things under consideration, I don't think anything's really out of the ordinary the way Yang tries to support Biden
A presidential candidate has declared that he will force Americans to fund Planned Parenthood. This would undo a litany of reforms put in place by the Trump Administration.   We cannot lose the progress we have made to protect life.
George Soros and his progressives plan to defeat Trump and usher in his NWO.
Your platform is atrocious. You are not better than trump and that bar is set incredibly low. Clearly the ruling class wont tolerate peaceful revolution, we still need revolution though. Stay armed comrades
Just as nightmarish as trump being president. Both are on the same side
They cannot - they will not .  And that's what I'm saying when asked if my kids will be returning to school - "They cannot and they will not" not until a real expert (not Trump witch doctors) say it is safe to return.
Want to know how much of a narcissist Trump really is? He paid a witch/voodoo doctor from a tribe to make a video saying Hydroxychloroquine is effective. Then he had a website made saying that over 6,000 doctors approved it. All with our tax dollars. Even Facebook killed the ads.
We plan to on 11/03/2029. Biden - 70%  Trump - 30%  with Mothers and veterans. Turns out tear gassing Americans who vote is not a great idea. I‚Äôll tell you this since your campaign manager won‚Äôt.
I have no such fear. He is a narcissistic psychopath and I would add borderline personality disorder to that mix. Ted Bundt is the closest person I‚Äôve ever seen to Trump. Ted was also very close to entering politics as well just off his charisma and his ability to lie.
Trump has no soul!
Perhaps this was foreplay for Epstein, Maxwell, and Trump...I wish her well.
What do you mean by trending? I've been on FB so I don't understand twitter. Everyday we bitch about Trump being a Fascist, Racist, Pedophile/Rapist, Grifter, Traitor, COWARD, Liar, Cheater, and Gross!
Moms, Veterans, and the Portland Mayor - all conspiring to impose total anarchy and burn this mother to the ground!!!  ü§£HA!!! Whoever runs Fox news took the Trump suggestion and injected bleach directly into their brains. Total buffoons at best. Liars and frauds in reality.
Trump Announced, Then Canceled, a Yankees Pitch. Both Came as a Surprise.
Trump must not have gotten the memo yet, but all of trump‚Äôs buildings will be destroyed after January!
That burns me up. He plays stupid, but we know what trump said to turtle, ‚Äùdo as I say or i‚Äôll leak about your illegal ties to China and Russia and citizens unite‚Äù#turtlesafuckingliartoo
Mr. Biden is very smart to wait until the final second. It drives Trump batshit crazy not knowing, and it saves whomever he chooses from the immediate media smear that is coming. But I'm with you, I can;t wait to see whom he  chooses.
I think they meant to say (sing??) ‚ÄúTHREE women vote for Trump‚Äù
His is a blatantly political statement, confirming what we already knew: that Barr is a repugnant Trump partisan operative and no public servant
150K people are dead and millions are out of work and Trump's priority for the COVID relief bill is $2 BILLION for a new FBI HQ in downtown DC because Trump doesn't want the FBI to move to the suburbs and have the old site redeveloped w/a hotel that will compete with his  No joke
Remember John Cusack‚Äôs Movie Grifters? Do you think that's trump‚Äôs favorite movie?
Abortion to a Pharisaical Evangelical is, in every case, killing another human being. Killing is wrong. So that's what they hang their hat on. Also to Trump, he is not at fault for the Covid deaths: its everyone else BUT him. Republicans are like Teflon, nothing sticks to them
Did you ever think trump could find someone like Barr to protect his ass?? Barr and turtle are the only reasons trump is still
Trump is a savage for this, he‚Äôs bouta shake the room
Great.  So Trump's presidency will have to go down as a graphic design flaw.
It kind of looks like Epstein trained them. I know Trump and Barr don‚Äôt care, but was she able to shower after the assault?
GOP should be penalized for allowing trump to continue.Citizens should make their lives hell! We need to harass their GOP asses.They are all hiding secrets it's time for them to be exploited by the public . It‚Äôs time info is leaked about all of the players keeping trump in office
These are tried &amp; true tactics by Trump. When someone criticizes him, he frequently offers them a job. That way, they become ensnared in his orbit. Initially he plays nice. But one thing we know is that he is pathologically vengeful. 1/
Congress needs to send in the troops to stop trump‚Äôs killers. For all we know these guys are prisoners and guards and hill-jacks and gun lovers hired to do fucked up evil shit!!? Do something Democrats, no stupid deals under the table with GOP, take them down! What‚Äôs going on??
Suicide if Trump beats Biden.
Well fuck him. Also why can't we use our army against Trump and his group! Let‚Äôs face it the protests are against Trump too, and we need him down so things can change for the better! He's already started a war!!
It's the fear we need to avoid, that's what‚Äôs fueling trump. It gets harder every day to not freak out, but try not to. Enough of us manifesting that he and pence die from the virus could make it come true!!
Vandals are playing right into Trump's hand.
All of life is unfair to a narcissist. Its never them, its always someone else treating them wrong. It is one of the few mental disorders that is not treatable today. Our lesson from Hitler and Trump has to be - never, ever give a narcissist power over a country. Its deadly.
The entire World sees Trump as a loser. #TRUMPLOSING #TRUMPTREASON #TrumpGestapo
After his defeat Trump will blame Pence for Covid response, Barr for the Graffiti Gestapo goons and the Free A Felon Fridays, Birx for giving him bad Covid data. DeVos for the school deaths, the landslide votes against him on the USPS. Narcissist can never be held accountable.
Nah, bro. The democrats must have injected him with the lab made Covid to make Supreme Leader Trump look bad
My guess is this is how Trump will get his next wife after he is no longer in office.  This seems to work for him, even though Americans won't stand for it. Sad.  Soulless. Narcissistic. Incompetent. #BIDENLANDSLIDE2020
Untrained gestapo goons. Trump spends 61 million on these jokers and refuses to help AMERICANS who need financial help during a pandemic he is also doing nothing about. Trump is a total, complete failure. Soulless. #TRUMPFAILURE #TRUMPGASSESMOMS #TRUMPGASSESVETS
Biden didn‚Äôt give Putin a BJ in Helsinki....Trump did. Case closed.
Dude, Trump tried extortion and got himself impeached. He knows Sinclair, Fox, and OANN will run with any BS he comes up with. He‚Äôs desparate. Easy to see if your heads not buried in the sand.
Trump steals musicians music for his rallies so expect no less from anyone mindlessly following him. He steals taxpayers money for Gestapo goons.  If its ok for him then its ok for them. Remember it was his followers who were drinking bleach because he said it was great.
Good. That means the tribute to Rep. Lewis will be respectful which is what he deserved. Trump isn‚Äôt worthy of attending.
It‚Äôs appropriate that Trump doesn‚Äôt go. He is anti-Civil Rights. Being a man of color, Lewis represented everything that Trump despised. He‚Äôs a racist.
bring me the axe!  #FLOTUSDearest
Don't even know these people! Trump is finished! The world will be a safer place when he is gone.
What entertainer in their right mind would want to be associated with the Trump brand?
Good, he wouldn't want you there anyway  #GoodTrouble #TraitorInChief
please at least offer VP job to  because she is ready to backup your admin, and what better way to right the wrong she experienced when sent in 2016 by  Trump Putin to women worldwide? Say you scared of her, she is who I choose.
I don't get why this is continuing? Please tell me how this is legal? How can Trump be allowed to enforce this? Isn‚Äôt this grounds for termination!!
The good news is the national security adviser meets with Trump every day for updates. At least they are supposed to. Trump has been exposed, if he doesn't get it then yeah aliens have given him the vaccine!
There is a silver lining, someone in that crowd has the virus. Probably more than a few, and my wish is that some droplets flew his way and sometime soon trump is taken to the hospital and is put on a ventilator and placed in a coma and eventually dies!
That's just how ignorant Trump and complicit Republicans are. Trump put a buddy in charge of the USPS and he's purposefully slowing down the mail. That also means IRS will not get their money on time. Trump would screw up a single car funeral.
So what if Trump is responsible for: 150k+ deaths via his inactivity, blatant racism, tear gassing Moms and Vets, freeing felons on Friday nights, spending 160 million on fake police instead of helping jobless.  What flavor is your koolaide and when do the aliens come to save you
We named our restrooms Trump.  We now go "take a Trump" and remind everyone to wipe their "Donalds" when their finished.  ü§£
To honor Donald Trump, Websters dictionary will be replacing the word "fascism" with "Trumpism" on 11/04/2020.  Also his picture will be beside the word "narcissist" so that America never forgets.really hates y‚Äôall! Rich talks a lot about grownups, and what-not. In the vacinity of Trump! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
Trump is in election trouble, so he's confusing Americans, eroding trust - Business Insider
I had two grandparents with dementia and it‚Äôs a sad horrible disease and to think people are going to vote for Biden who clearly has early stages of it because they hate trump so much is pathetic.
Some Republican senators politely rejected President Donald Trump's suggestion Thursday to "Delay the Election" beyond Nov. 3, indicating that the long-shot idea is dead on arrival in Congress.
Amy's in the minority of people who get excited when Trump gains a little ground.
Black trump supporters get worse treatment than any other people in America
Now you understand why our country is so divided. It‚Äôs not trump, it‚Äôs the dirtiest most corrupt president in the history of the USA. He has put in place the beginnings of a division the will take decades to overcome.
History is a good teacher. The use of Jack booted thugs are in history and hated. Your practice of ignoring the constitution reminds me of Hitler. Thats my opinion of you when it comes to sending Feds to cause problems by basically kidnapping people off the street. Hil Trump.
President Donald Trump met Thursday with the family of a soldier who investigators say was slain on the Texas Army base where she was stationed, saying it is a ‚Äúterrible story‚Äù and that he would help with funeral expenses.
Truly amazing. God, how I miss him.   #BarackObama #BarackObamaEulogy #JohnLewisMemorial #JohnLewis #trump
Did they just say that Pence's bus collided with a Dump Trump vehicle? #DumpTrump2020
Really? MSNBC is not paying Trump any attention! Maybe Fox News will give him some time!
95K retweets=keeping the name of the Robert E Lee base! USA Population=328.2 mil! Trump uses twitter retweets as a gauge in making decisions! The ?: were these 95K retweets +ve or -ve. I know my retweets of him are -ve! #TrumpIsAnIdiot #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace
We know a lot of people Don't always support the Speaker Of The House Nancy Pelosi . But I bet those people have more respect for her today, at least she honored the late John Lewis today. Unlike someone else we know who wouldn't (Trump). Kind of surprised he didn't go golfing!
Poor, poor  because #NobodyLikesMe, he emphasizes "especially me." RIP Herman Cain, evidently the last American to like Trump! #NobodyLikesTrump #ThePresidentIsACrybaby
RIGHT NOW: President Donald Trump is hosting a news conference from the White House. Watch live on Facebook:
Trump. If he keeps talking about delaying the election.
Lauren, Did You Hear that President Trump is going to introduce 600 Bull Sharks, into Lake Michigan, Only during the Summer months..as a New Habitat for them?
landslide loss is coming to trump.  The end of a directionless, fascist but short lived regime.
Senator Cronyism apparent lives in as fragile a bubble as Trump. Pity.
Should have let him have HCQ  oh wait you type of people got it taken away why because it's cheap effect and trump said it was good oh and if trump wasnt the one that said that but Dr fuckery said it you people would all be on board with it.
NO one wants Trump's plasma.
Ding ding ding we have a winner. tRump doesn't scratch his nuts without asking Putin.
Do you agree with President Trump? The date of the presidential election is enshrined in federal law and would require an act of Congress to change.
Using the Democratic logic against them by using a Trump Card *Pun intended* ..üòà
Trump's wasting his time. Obama is an out-classing rule unto himself.
WRONG.   Donald Trump is #ImpeachedForLife.  #MyPresident is not. Barack Obama is EVERYTHING Trump will NEVER be. And that is American.
The Trump administration wants $377 million in the next coronavirus relief bill for a long-delayed modernization of the West Wing.
You mean put Trump 1st
Best thing to come out of Trump rally??
"Mr. Trump went on, ‚ÄúI had about 95,000 positive retweets on that. That‚Äôs a lot,‚Äù appearing to refer to a Twitter post last Friday in which he said that Mr. Inhofe had assured him that he won‚Äôt change the names of ‚Äúmilitary forts and bases‚Äù"  Rule by retweet
The Trump administration last week announced that it would pay Pfizer nearly $2 billion for December delivery of 100 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine under development.
The disrespect continues. Hmm, what event is going on right now that would cause Trump to tweet like a jackass and then call in the press.   I hope networks refuse to carry anything he says.
I seriously disliked him while he was in office. I disliked him far less afterwards. Kept his nose out of Obama's business. I was opposed to Iraq 100%. I felt Katrina response was as irresponsible as trump's Covid response. But I never felt he was a racist narcissist traitor.
Donald Trump thinks delaying the election will conjure up more votes for him and deter us from getting to the polls. He‚Äôs afraid of the LANDSLIDE loss and shanking he‚Äôs about to receive. He simply cannot avoid this. It is coming like a freight train. #WeWillVote
Powerful, honest essay from within on what the GOP has become. The conclusion is simple: only a major November defeat could create shockwaves strong enough to reunite the Republican Party with its conscience.
‚ÄúLife can be a challenge... But you and I can make a difference.‚Äù  If only Herman had caught a mask and some Pok√©mon instead of Rona at a Trump rally. üòî
How did Trump turn to her? Him. Was she the only one speaking? Oh, so you just picked one of the Doctors message and attack the president? Why, because he elevated Doctors voices? I believe their were about 10 doctors? Oh wait, you don‚Äôt care anyway. You hate trump and that‚Äôs it
I bet Mary Trump would agree that Fred Trump Sr. would be really embarrassed of little Donnie right now!
So it‚Äôs safe for kids to go to school, but It‚Äôs too dangerous to hold an election? Trump will do anything to stay in power. #RememberInNovember  #RidenWithBiden2020
True:
Trump is causing the Riots! He's trying to stop the people from protesting him out of office,  just as we did trying to keep him from office!
so trump wants kids to go to school 7 hours a day, 10 months a year because they ‚Äúneed to go to school‚Äù but can‚Äôt have a election... hm, seems like he only cares about what benefits himself.
Stay in the real world people! This requires a law change!
If the roles were reversed Trump would be calling for mail in voting but because his useless ass is getting booty blasted by Creepy Uncle Joe he is against mind you recently some Republicans won their primaries with mail in voting
Trump campaign reportedly ordered removal of social-distancing stickers in Tulsa ‚Äì as it happened  Hermain Cain
Herman Cain has died of COVID, which he almost certainly caught at Trump's Tulsa rally on June 20. He was an outspoken opponent of mandatory masks.  Am I supposed to feel bad about this? Is my empathy supposed to be a goddamn superpower or something?
This death is added to the many thousands that Trump allowed to happen with no regret or remorse.
I agree! Trump took off the warning stickers Tulsa had put on each seat in the stadium!!! MURDER indeed!!!!!!!
This is going to be the scariest election ever. America is literally black vs. white AGAIN. If trump wins, it will be the BLM/anti trumper riots. If Biden wins it‚Äôs going to be the white supremacists rioting because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what BLM did over George Floyd‚Äù. It‚Äôs going to be war.üòî
We are burying Rep. Lewis right now! Trump refused to attend his funeral! South Bend lost a beloved mayor: Sorry, I have zero f# to give for a man responsible for so many deaths himself! Did I just say that?
Or scenario 3 His brain dead supporters meet angry citizens who have had enough of Trump and their shenanigans! There they learn what Hitler learned ‚Äú üá∫üá∏: these colors really don‚Äôt run!
You are correct to feel that way! We need to be prepared to fight back!
Just so we're clear, you can mourn the loss of both #JohnLewis and #HermanCain but they led VERY different lives. Don't get it mixed up and say Cain is getting different treatment/coverage because he was a Trump supporter. Lewis literally marched in Selma. Cain ran a pizza chain.
TRUMP: Most people with Covid just have the sniffles. We need to reopen schools ASAP.  ALSO TRUMP: Perhaps we should delay the election until after the pandemic.  What a joke! #WeWillVote
Governor Gretchen Whitmer released a statement following President Trump suggesting in a tweet that the United States should postpone the 2020 election.
He literally got it from going to that absolute joke fest of a rally Trump did in Tulsa last month this administration and the GOP as a whole is one big Jim Jones like death cult
#NEW: Gov. Whitmer comes out against President Trump's suggestion of delaying the 2020 election.
I have some cruelty online alright! Trump is a murderer!
The 2012 GOP pres. candidate attended Pres. Trump‚Äôs rally in Tulsa on June 20. The Trump campaign disclosed before the event that six staff members who had been working on the rally and two Secret Service members tested positive.
While you let Trump steal houses! and gut our chances for an expanded ACA! Not to mention trying to shovel drugs into the community! You have an agenda!
Conservative news site,  is reporting that Herman Cain has died from the coronavirus. He was admitted to the hospital 10 days after attending President Trump's Tulsa rally, according to the article.
Did you hear your close friend, Trump wants to delay the election?  Have you no shame ?  How can you stand by and let him get away with that. Sen John McCain must be turning in his grave. #Shameful
Why have yet to see any Republican Congress members denounce Trump‚Äôs tweet about delaying an election?      where are you all at??
Note that this was also in this same op-ed: ‚ÄúBiden accused the president of trying to make it harder for people to vote by mail by defunding or otherwise hindering the Postal Service‚Äôs operations. There‚Äôs absolutely no proof Trump wants to do that, but that didn‚Äôt stop Biden.‚Äù
Not on Trump's orange tintype will the election be delayed. It isn't up to him. Mail-in voting WILL prevail, and we WILL be rid of him in January, 2021.
President Trump is suggesting to delay the 2020 general election.
#ThingsIDontUnderstand   Trump can campaign talking about shooting someone on 5th Ave and not losing any voters, but let one person say they wanna shoot him and it's all treason and secret service all over them.
NEW: President Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to November‚Äôs presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud:
Trump is a master troll.  He will be laughing his ass off all day at the response.  (He is NOT going to delay the election.)
Trump is an absolute MASTER.  There is no one like him.  And what‚Äôs hilarious about it all is that the leftists think he‚Äôs as dumb as a rock.  And yet THEY fall for it EVERY time!
"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???" President Trump just tweeted.  What do you think?
Oh yeah trump mulling the idea of delaying the election totally "bait" do you have any problems finding your way home at night?
Trump probably would like to do this but I'm guessing today this is about distracting from the terrible GDP numbers.
Is this how we MAGA? Declining economy. Job loss. Failure to get ahead of a pandemic.   The list goes on and on and only proves one thing. Trump is not fit for leadership. There is only one man who can lead us out of this mess. #Biden2020  #BidenCoalition
You‚Äôll never be as rich as Trump. Remember that. He gives not one shit about anyone but himself.
Trump said it about both. WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL. He doesn‚Äôt GET to separate people for ANY reason. It‚Äôs illegal. Idiot.
And you spend too much time praising the unpraisable.
I'm a big #Trump supporter but this is funny. You need to be able to laugh at your own side.

WATCH LIVE: President Trump is in Texas, talking to the energy sector.
I'm sure Trump will also be facing some indictments when he is no longer president.  What we need is a president that is an actual hard working American. Not some career politician or billonaire.
I often  think about who took trump's place when he avoided the draft
Right? I understand the media has an agenda too. I make my own decisions. Which is why I didn't vote for Clinton. I don't like Biden either but he is the lesser of the two evils.  Trump will be a 1 term president and so will Biden.
Was Trump's dad involved with this project
Lol a liberal. Just because I don't like Donald Trump doesn't mean I'm a liberal. This is why he won't win in November. He needs Independent voters to win and a lot of us are turning away. His base alone isn't strong enough for the amount of votes he needs.
We have no friends or allys anymore Trump has seen to that
May the real truth surface! #PutinsPuppet #TrumpLovesPutinMoreThanAmericans Thinking Trump may even start crying more! #ThePresidentIsACrybaby

That edited misleading bullshit! Jim cut out part where the chaos  started, by Trump's FED cult! That's OK! Because  Democrats showed how peaceful the protesters were! And Congresswoman Tlaib set the bar on Barr. He's ok with violence as long as it's Trump's violent protesters!

President Donald Trump issued a stout defense Tuesday of a disproved use of a malaria drug as a treatment for the coronavirus, hours after social media companies moved to take down videos promoting its use as potentially harmful misinformation.
This the kinda ppl Trump üò† bring out. How with what's going on in the country right now, that they would think this would be ok. Racist at it's best thanks Trump for showing you're ppl how this is okay. I'm sure this makes you happy üòä.

The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor‚Äôs office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents if the state stepped up its own enforcement.
Everyone agrees these people should not be at the protests, these protests are for protestors.  The reason we know that trump sent them is because of their actions.  Now some people think they are there to do a job.

You lied about Trump and Russia and Bill Barr is an honorable man.  can sometimes be mean and I don‚Äôt like when he does that, BUT I NEVER have to question his love for our country and the American people. He has been everything I prayed he would be, plus some.

President Donald Trump is hosting a news conference from the White House. Watch live on Facebook:
He's Donald Trump.
He doesn't care about the people or Our Constitution. He is apart of the systemic racisim in this country.  FYI Not all white people believe in what Trump or Barr stand for. Some of us will fight against what is wrong. #Blacklivesmatter
For once I agree with mcturtle. Look deeper. Rump wants the FBI building right where it stands, across the street from his hotel. FBI had new building on another property. tRump blocked that. If FBI moves it opens up NEW COMPETITION for tRump hotel. It's always about the MONEY!
The Trump administration will deny new applications for so-called ‚ÄúDreamer‚Äù immigrants and cut renewals to one year from two years, despite reversals in court that kept alive the Obama-era program to shield young people from deportation.
Not mine! Not a lot of folks! Trump‚Äôs tax cut taxed Peter to pay Paul!

And aside from Trump, DeSantis is why.
Trump should be doing one-tenth as well as Governor Cuomo has, in responding to this pandemic. You really are the ultimate in horse's asses.
What happened to Americans and our Congress,we use to be a civil country. Since Trump took office üò° morals and values have went out the window. Americans are dying and hungry and Congress is fighting over 600 dollars.
"Numerous studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine is not effective and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently withdrew an order that allowed the drug's use as a emergency treatment for COVID-19."

A week after appearing to project a more serious tone about the coronavirus, President Trump is back to pushing unproven claims that an anti-malaria drug is an effective treatment.
Just in very recent elections I remember two claims circulating to that effect...both were incorrect, the closed precincts supported Trump in 2016
This pos let's his children set and watch PORN with his lovely wife..had to have his daughter sleep with them after PRESIDENT TRUMP was elected..NOTHING THIS PEDOPHILE HAS TO SAY CONCERNS ME..TRAITOR MEDIA HATE AMERICA CITIZENS.
They called Trump! a racist because he built a ‚Äú wall‚Äù Supported Boogaloos! Sided with crooked cops!
Twitter has temporarily limited Donald Trump Jr.'s account after he tweeted a video that violated the company's policies on coronavirus misinformation, according to CNN.
How is suspending Baby Trump election interference?
Why should we care what Trump feels while #Trumpkillstexas ?
Twitter restricted Donald Trump Jr.'s ability to tweet after he posted a video featuring a doctor making false claims about coronavirus cures and stating that people "don't need masks" to prevent the virus from spreading.
Nina Turner appears to be working for the Trump campaign now. Who out there is shocked?
Trump is a fool, a liar, and a failure.  It did not have to be this way.
That would be Trump alright! He will play the card until he loses! Then he will go all ‚Äú I am not racist, but......‚Äù.
Watching Trump having a frothing, meltdown fit, much like Dracula being exposed to sunlight.
And, aside from Trump's dementia, the shoe lifts make him unsteady.
Trump looks as if he just sneaked a Depends fart.
Twitter removed a tweet that had been retweeted by President Trump that falsely said there is a cure for the coronavirus.
Well, Bannon's using Trump's brand of makeup to cover his gin blossoms.
She got her M.D. from Trump University.

And they‚Äôre saying they are Trump supporters
#projecting are we? You know Trump is afraid to debate anyone. Like he‚Äôs afraid to throw out that first pitch. Open your eyes... you might see something.
Why are  Trump supporters not interested in the war on drugs/opiates? That‚Äôs what both this tweet and TWR‚Äôs tweet say to me. As Trump would say, you‚Äôd rather have these drugs and killers on the street?
I would argue that  has done as much to render the term "conservative" useless as has Donald Trump. Probably more.
Would Kilmeade care to comment on Trump now being down 8 points nationally?

Yo straight up any of y‚Äôall jobs hiring? Im desperate for something decent my job is fucking awful and I work with a bunch of asshole trump supporters
Trump will pardon him
Protesters have sued the Trump administration to rein in what they describe as an out-of-control response by federal agents to demonstrations in Portland.
You sound unconfident, uncomfortable, and like you don't trust your presidency skills. ü§î Is Mr. Donald Trump actually scared of something? Like not getting elected and having to face his criminal charges finally? I think you just know you can't get your hands in the pot.
Got this crazy idea! If every voter that is prone to protest took three days to register to vote, prepare for absentee balloting, and set up polling places! It will expose boogaloos and bad actors, prepare folks for November, and make Trump pee his pants!
Thank you! Now we know what Trump is up to! When he contests the vote, we will have evidence of his attempts to suppress the vote!
And I don't understand women Trump supporters cause he has 0 respect for women
Trump supporters really are dumb ass fuck Facebook proves it everyday
If Biden takes Texas, it's all over but the crying for Trump! üòÇ
I don't think Trump's base is ever gonna unite with us. They will fight everything he promotes.
God not doing his damn job I might fire his ass cause trump still fucking here
They hated to accept the true reality! Since they can‚Äôt get to Trump, they went after the coach instead!
If making Trump look bad was illegal, Trump would have been in jail long ago... along with his hairdresser.

President Trump was never actually invited to throw out the first pitch at the  game. His ‚Äúannouncement‚Äù came as shock to White House staffers and the Yankees, according to the Times.
So called Mainstream America will meet the Real Mainstream America! We meet every four years! And we Know what Trump did TO us!
A series of recent polls have found that while former VP Joe Biden's supporters are highly motivated by anxiety and dislike for the incumbent president, President Trump's backers are more likely to be excited about their candidate and his campaign.
Brett Favre is 6‚Äô2‚Äù and 223#.  In comparison, Trump must weigh 280? More?

I don‚Äôt think it was accidental at all - it was the last ditch effort to unseat Trump - China, Dems, Communists - they are all in on it.
You're clueless!  Obviously, you know nothing about the economy. If Bush screwed it up, Obama had plenty of time to fix it, just like Trump fixed Obama's piss poor economy!
You forget to add this to the choices.  Trump &amp; the current administration.
He has done alot in 3-1/2 yrs, when you consider all that has been thrown at him. Just one legal procedure disarms, He's had Congress, Justice dept., assassin attempts&amp;[2 ticks you spray &amp;dont die, pelosi,schummer]. A TITAN,  my vote is his, TRUMP 2020, Best President of USA ever
1985, the same Man as today, he won me over, MAGA 2020. I Worked Hillary's campaign, walked, knocked in Little Havana, Miami;Obama's country,-not Hillary she was detested.Walked it with an American who came from Ohio, it wasn't happening. Researched Trump after 20 videos I SAW IT
247 people watching Bidens live stream. There is no way the actual number of people who will vote for him is this high. If a pollster asked me who I was voting for I'd say Biden just because I don't want my life ruined by Democrats. But I would vote Trump on election day.
But the legacy media told me Biden was trouncing President Trump! üôÑ 2020 is going to be 2016 all over again but with bigger tears and more hysterical reactions

Please President Trump, veto the mail-in voting for national elections.  We the people can and will stand in the polling sites while social distancing. If the mail-in voting does happen America will die in a rushing Blue wave.
President Donald Trump is for the first time floating a ‚Äúdelay‚Äù to the Nov. 3 presidential election, as he makes unsubstantiated allegations that increased mail-in voting will result in fraud.
A million miles is a little far fetched. Our focus right now is register voters, beat Trump/GOP, and have a mix of moderate/progressive agenda legislation that gets signed. The future is bright for progressives if younger voters vote. Let's focus on number one, voters.

It's been a constant battle between Establishment Republicans and Trumpers, some Establishment Reps have come around (Graham), some have been ousted (Ryan), some RINOs (Romney) still exist. I think McConnell is Establishment, but tolerates Trump because he's accomplished a lot.
Yep ... If true, it bothers me that we had 4 Republican Politician Traitors, that disregarded the wishes of Republican voters and put Trump through hell. If true, we need to vote these a**holes out!
I suspect the Gang of Eight (Reps and Dems) backed the investigation of Trump to see if he was dirty, and if impeached VP Pence would take his place. I'm waiting until end of Aug, but I think we've been strung along, the Gang of Eight can't let Strzok &amp; Comey be charged/tell all!

With all of the "acts" floating around, they need to stop acting and get it done already. üôÑ Everything keeps changing from day to day so until it's signed by Trump, I won't get my hopes up too much.
I know of one case where #Hydroxychloroquine #TurnedOutToBe a #LifeSaver -- but that doesn't mean #HydroxychloroquineIsTheCure for #Everybody. It's not that #CutAndDried.  Trump spreads video of doctor who falsely claims hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19
With all due respect, Trump is the collateral damage, we are the ones they are after.
Exactly ... If Biden has the solution to beating the pandemic, let's hear it! So, he'd rather see Americans suffer, than make it appear that he helped Trump. Biden needs to go back to sleep, he has no constructive criticism! It's full of BS!

Democrats don't give a damn. Neither do any of their allies in the media. Democrats will never support anything however small that puts President Trump in a favorable light. Vote Republican across the entire ballot in November
I don't think it was Obama and Biden personally. USA has long history of not prosecuting the President for crimes commited as sitting POTUS after they leave office. Watch though, that tradition will change in 2025 when President Trump leaves office.
Hey y‚Äôall, we can both vote Trump out and not elect Biden at the same time. #MojoJoJo.

"obama out" last correspondent dinner,  min 20 he speaks of Trump, never imagining him winning, Now that we know better its good to reminiscence, see what a room of adreno seems like, he is waiting for a death panel he says at minute 3:30,
Don't blame it on Trump. Reps have a mind of their own. When they see the rioting and chaos has gone too far, and the rule of law ignored. Citizen militia will fill the streets, without having to abide by the rule of law. Americans don't follow rules, when the other side cheats!
We don't delight in divisiveness ... Trump helps all people. The Democrats are divisive with the kneeling, reparations, white privilege, defund police, on and on ... They breed black racists and cop-haters!
Who remembers this, Obama 2011 making jokes at the annual press dinner, 2011 - Donald Trump was not impress, look at Rick Scott, now Senator for Florida, his observing Trump,why, what id he know, The 'Donald' don't play.
Trump is going to claim election fraud and not vacate the White House when  or  wins. I guarantee it.
Well Karen we will see how you feel 4 years from now when the democrats move even further to the right in an effort to win the White House because Trump won in 2020. Think about that for a minute.
The case for Trump being defeated even if that means electing a very smart kangaroo is all that matters.

Well explained, its not about Trump either, its about the black Cabal the Democrats are, they want THE control, over you.

Thing is, Biden can't beat Trump. Everybody already forgot about all of the closet Trump supporters that came out in droves last time. The polls are all done by leftist social media companies, not real numbers. Biden's who said Blacks live in jungles.
I don‚Äôt think Trump would be involved in that mess. He denied him access to Key Largo years ago. I read this in an article a few days ago.

The federal budget deficit under Trump rose by 3 trillion dollars over his first three years in office to $22.8 trillion. In the 1st 6 months of 2020 it has risen to $26.5 trillion even without the House's stimulus bill.  Oh, those tax-n-spend Republicans!
Trump hasn't sued  yet. Bet he's scared of messing with her.
If that was true why are all diverse big cities thriving while the red trump inclusive city‚Äôs are broke &amp; taking more $$ than any other state? Also why do the GOP looks like the 3rd Reich with only 3 POCs? Why hasn‚Äôt Trump denounced KKK / Alt Right?
Finally Trump is about to do something to  #MAGA Sign that NDAA and codify into Law that the Confederate Traitor Names will be gone off military installations, and all Confederate Traitor items Banned from military.
Just Imagine being a Trump Supporter, and thinking... "Yes Thank you, blah blah blah".  All over a LIE about changing the names of Bases named after Traitors to America.  How fucking stupid do you have to be to listen to this guy?
Wtf is wrong with  ? Has he always been a tyrannical authoritarian or has he just discovered these tendencies since President Trump was elected?

Healthcare workers are NOT being tested routinely, but Mr. Trump is being tested ‚Äúseveral times a day‚Äù as well as those around him in the White House. Some health workers haven‚Äôt been tested at all. Why??
Trump will most likely lose, but his policies will win. The Democrats would love to wield DHS with the brutality and savagery that Trump has been doing.
There are times when I really like Meghan, but clearly she was out of line. Mary Trump put her straight in an intelligent gentle manner.
I think it's a damn disgrace. Rino's all. These are the reason why President Trump has had to accomplish what he's done essentially by himself. I will be voting for Donald Trump in November

Democrats are the greatest danger to our country and our way of life. Everywhere Democrats are in power is being used to defeat President Trump. The stupid people who elected these despicable people deserve what they get. Buy as many guns and ammunition as you possibly can.
Democrats want to destroy our country and remove the remaining freedoms that we have. Everything that's happening all over the country leads to that end. Also they want President Trump out of the way. Research 1937 Germany. Remove freedoms in little bites until they they're gone
Rioters ,funded and organized by Democrats are their allies, are just being used to further the one world agenda that is supported and promoted by those Democrats. Our President Donald Trump  stands in their way. The left is using everything possible to reach their goals
It is Trump's America but also history repeating itself: 1930's in Nazi Germany. Scary, also something I thought would never take place in our country in my 60plus years.

I‚Äôm with you. Trump seems to have caved with the other Republicans.
You don't live in the real world. All of the Media (even those controlled by Democrats) say that violent crime is substantially higher in these cities. It's a free-for-all for criminals! Yeah, Dem Media wants you to believe that it is all pretend to fire up Trump's base ... BS!
And you think that gang bangers having turf wars over who can sell drugs in a certain area, or reaping pay back for being ripped off, has anything to do with what any President says? NO! Sure, COVID may have told them to double down on the risk of death ... Trump can't change it.

If Jeff Bezos wanted to REALLY get under TRUMP's skin, he would donate some of the $13B he made this year to the USPS to insure that mail-in ballots get delivered!  That, or deliver them for the USPS for free using his PRIME delivery service!  Wow! Would that piss him off!

Unfortunately, it may depend on if you are a Republican or Democrat. There are a lot of people who are devoted Trump followers and will continue to follow his example no matter how many people die. It's the mask and social distancing. Some people just want to have fun + ignore it

He shouldn't have caught a "Democratic hoax". He shouldn't have died from "it's just the flu". Who in leadership has been spreading these lies and telling people they don't need masks? Oh yeah, Trump. He believed Trump, he caught it, and now he's dead.
Trump wanting to delay the election is just the very beginning of him trying to cheat and steal the election .... again.
Trump always tests the waters.  Like how he said he could fire Mueller before he tried to fire Mueller.  This was a dance rehearsal to see if he had any weak links on his side.  Trump found even Lindsey Graham unwilling to move the election.
He is a Trump supporter so...
Herman Cain made his own decisions so blaming President Trump for the communist Chinese delivered Covid-19 is as ignorant as blaming the post office for the poisoned seeds being sent to Americans from communist China.
Stop with the election being postponed  Everytime you keep it going you're showing you got played. Trump plays Twitter tactics , smarten up!  Orchestrated Choas is the plan
He hasn‚Äôt though &amp; has a mass amount of supporters. Very loyal supporters who are all around us. Biden doesn‚Äôt have the following to immediately win this, and he isn‚Äôt gaining them quickly. People can‚Äôt stand him either and every Independent vote is a vote for Trump...

Holy fuck.  You would never get Trump to focus long enough to get through the questionnaire.   They ask a lot of questions to donate blood. Trump isn‚Äôt good with questions.
#FascistTrump's tweet about the election really should not be let go. It is as bad as it sounds, even if he hasn't the legal authority to do it. But it portends obstruction of the election to come. So... Remove Trump by Force Now. Or it's getting really BAD. And soon.

How flipping ironic, telling him he believes ‚Äúanything‚Äù when there is proof that trump/PressSec have done those things, when there is proof!! You‚Äôre the one who believes every word out of Emperor Tang‚Äôs mouth!
Of course he did Dirty Trick Trump. Everyone watched Obama and saw what a real A real President sounds like and were saddened to face the reality of an idiot in office  I want him to see this. We Miss Obama, we are sadder who we have now VOTE Nov 3 vote OUT Trump!
But running test on voter fraud, means there's nothing there and you're trying to find some. If you had proof of massive voter fraud, you'd show it. But ohbwait, didn't trump have a voter fraud commission? Yulp! Disbanded when found NO mass voter fraud!!!!
TRUMP said 2016 was rigged against him and that he'd lose bc it was rigged. Thereby she took it on herself to help stop the incorrectly alleged rigging, by casting additional ballot. Just like when trump said he'd pay legal fees for supporters who ruffed protestors  Rally's.
It‚Äôs obvious Donald Trump shouldn‚Äôt be at the #JohnLewisMemorial today. What‚Äôs not obvious is the shame our nation should feel that we have allowed a man so base, so immoral, so embarrassing that it‚Äôs right that he not be there to remain our President for over 3 years.
political journalist: "What if Trump said this: In my desire to respect the norms and spaces so deftly carved out by my predecessors, I am willing to compromise." trump: "Doritoes cut inside of mouth! VERY UNFAIR! will be making LAW that chips cannot be sharp in SECONF term
I remember trump killing 150,000 with piss poor Covid guidance.Donald Trump is personally paying the funeral funds for Breonna Taylor. This is one out of MANY reasons why I LOVE MY president !!!
You didn't understand what I was saying, trump is killing all Americans. He isn't choosing a race,  religion, age, sex. He thinks he is above all and trying to kill all of us.
Wow first time we‚Äôve heard this from the trump admin. It‚Äôs likely a desperate stretch to connect with a public who unfortunately have lost confidence in the White House
Trump* is ALWAYS *respectful*... right?  I THINK NOT. NOT A RESPECTFUL bone in his body.
WOW  I'm AMAZED at what this *MAN*, (&amp; I use the term loosely), knows.  Okay, okay, I'm not perfect, and I'm by far, NOT a GENIUS... ... BUT I DON'T GO AROUND THE WORLD LYING, &amp; TELLING EVERYONE, THAT I AM. DAMN trump* just STOP
not people I know calling trump a genius and actually believing what they say...
I have to be honest. This is his reaction now, but in a couple months I will not be very surprised when he still goes along with it. It seems to be the way he‚Äôs been working. Experience dictates that he acts like Trump is crazy and than rubber stamps the whole way.
Trump is a threat to the constitution. If you can't see that then you're a dumbass
Treason is the only word for trump and Putin. He keeps calling Putin, but not because of the Bounties that was put on our soldier‚Äôs heads. He is worst than any other leader, even Hitler.#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020
This is why I am against sending our kids back. Don‚Äôt think this virus is not effect our kids. It is and there are kids that has died. We have protected our kids, and now with no plan in place, trump wants to send them back. He is trying to kill our future.
It's pretty pathetic when you would rather have people suffer by having the economy get worse than to risk having Trump get re-elected if the economy improves.
One quality I could never stand is bullying others, to fuel their belief that they are better. Way back when, when I was in school, I stood up for the ones that was being bullied, and talked to everyone that was ignored by others. And I still do. That is why I don‚Äôt like trump.
But you agree with all the deaths he has caused? I have never seen America in such a horrible state. He is the worst leader in the world, past or present. But you go right ahead and help keep destroying and killing America and vote for Trump.
Godfather‚Äôs Pizza guy Herman Cain just died because he supported Trump‚Äôs anti- mask agenda at their Tulsa rally! Is this guy next?
Do not let him fool you, he knows exactly what he is doing.  Trump is doing what his best friend Putin wants him to do. Destroy America to weaken us.Trump is doing just that. He is killing everyone off.He hates Americans, he knows he is going to prison, so kill as many as he can.
Trump admits he reads the everything, that he reads a lot. But still didn‚Äôt know about the bounty on our troops head.
Trump's numbers in the polls must really be down for him to talk about delaying the election.
Gosh why ever would Trump be floating insanity about delaying the election and trying to suck all of the air out of the news cycle when the only thing that he's ever campaigned on is collapsing in flames
I take a nap, and wake up to Trump calling for a delay in the election. Sleep drunkenness to the max rn
On second thought. I forget with Trump that it can be BOTH.
BBC News reports, Donald Trump calls for delay to 2020 U.S. presidential election until Americans can vote "properly, securely, safely." President continues assailing vote by mail option.
Must be something good in those new Maxwell documents. Don‚Äôt take Trump‚Äôs bait here. He was always gonna try this.
So let me try to understand this philosophy...for 4 years now social media freely and openly publishes lies about President Trump concerning Russia, Ukraine and Charlottesville, but censors world class doctors who share proven data that hydroxychloroquine helps treat COVID.
That is against the law.  Trump needs to be stopped.
I wonder if Kanye has any idea he‚Äôs been egged on into running by the Trump campaign in the hope he‚Äôll be the Ralph Nader or Ross Perot of 2020.
With the level of projection coming out of these people recently I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a few tweets further down that Trump himself has ACTUALLY been lost. And I‚Äôm not making a joke here.
No you and trump are üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
It won‚Äôt happen. We can‚Äôt even get governors to follow cdc reopening guidelines. Trump needs a win so kids will go to school and businesses will open. Governments don‚Äôt care.
Very believable that you‚Äôre a trump simp and that you live in Scotland. Tons of those totally exist
Donald J. Trump is just a Lap Dog for the Radical Right Agenda. He does whatever they want!
Trump** lmao I‚Äôve had a few drinks y‚Äôall
We don‚Äôt need or want a theocracy. If you want that go find some uninhabited island somewhere and start it.   Ralph Reed: Trump must be reelected so Christians ‚Äòare at the head of our political system‚Äô -
And given Trump's rocky state of relations with China, Russia, and North Korea, why would they want to get Trump re-elected?
You'd have to be really bad in statistics to assume that a national election with 50 different states involved and thousands of individual precincts can still be rigged at the micro level to pre-determine the macro level outcome. If Trump is so unpopular, why are you worried?
He‚Äôs a criminal same as trump. There‚Äôs no legitimate defense for anything he‚Äôs done as AG.
Trump is a LIAR and a FAILURE. vote for Joe. He will deliver on the wall
Trump abruptly walks out of press conference after asked why he tweeted out a doctor who has claimed in the past that space alien DNA is being used to make medice.  What an idiot.
Donald J. Trump  27 Jul 2020 - 11:18:24 PM  Make #hydroxychloroquine available over the counter! It will prevent and stop it for next to nothing!  This is all outrageous and needlessly destructive. All of #America should be open now üá∫üá≤üá∫üá≤
Have Trump pull out his Sharpie to fix this.
Trump Grifts, You Die  via  #TrumpIsACrybaby
Your ignorance is ignoring history. Hitler gets away with it because the world was caught off guard but with Trump, we have seen this all before and it does not end well.
The cowards and racists are the supporters of Trump. #ProudBoys #UnitetheRight #NSM
I just saw the tape of trump* saying Putin was, "EXTREMELY POWERFUL in his denial, today", again. And ...  "Yeah, he probably BITCH-SLAPPED ya", just rolled right off my tongue. &lt;smh&gt;
They drank the KOOL-AID.  They wouldn't know the TRUTH if it kicked them in the A$$ as trump was throwing them off a cliff. They would STILL blame dems
That was the dumbest thing I have heard yet. This isn‚Äôt how I feel trump, it is about not wanting my kids or grandkids to die, and I do not want to die. It is not safe.  Numbers keep going up, not down. So maybe your are just another trump lover who believes everything he says.
A bipartisan group secretly gathered to game out a contested Trump-Biden election. It wasn‚Äôt pretty
I‚Äôve been saying this for weeks. We are way smarter than trump thinks we are.
Hey Mike Ditka making excuses for being old doesn‚Äôt get you off the hook for your comments. Just like Trump. Being older doesn‚Äôt correlate with ignorance.  Maybe rethink your statements.
Oh, I specifically stated white evangelical boomers personally. When 80 something percent vote for trump it‚Äôs not generalizing. We‚Äôve watched with our own eyes as they sold out faith and compassion for power and money. And many of those people are still in charge.
Malaysia has a president? And it‚Äôs also trump? That‚Äôs wild
People, this needs to stop. They don‚Äôt care that you are peaceful, they care about following trump‚Äôs orders.
We need to do anything and everything it takes to stop other presidents to do what trump as done to destroy us. It needs to be put in laws, so they will be charged. And punished to the fullest.
Confused. Why has there not already been one? Our troops give their lives for us,threir families are proud and support them. So please explain to me why protecting trump‚Äôs name and to great possiblility in his involment, means more than protecting our troops.
NSM fascists love the Nazi imagery and salute and they love Donald Trump.
Yep that looks like the Trump check list he has/is doing them all
It was awesome to see Trump's Wall come down but at the same moment that's our tax dollars going to waste and we can't afford that right now or can we afford to let Trump be in office for another 4 years get out and vote people make it count
There are deluding ourselves and creating falsehood trying to prop up Donald Trump that's only from the Republicans point of view from the non-political point of view Trump is losing big and will continue to do so
This is what Trump stole money from military families for. Pathetic!
Trump 2020
I wonder if paintings in future centuries will have a demonic Trump shitting on the floor or something while the other presidents lend aid?
Definitely not voting for Biden and his criminal party after the stunts they‚Äôve pulled in 2020. So yes, Trump.
He has to come out of hiding first. You guys just keep destroying the streets, killing, raping and pillaging. You‚Äôre the best thin to happen for Trump in years hahaha!
he only hit these "record numbers" because of what obama handed down. If obama had run the economy into the ground or if Trump had taken over from a recession like Obama did, he wouldn't have had "record breaking" success. He &amp; many of his supporters act like he did it all
For the past 10 years it has consistently gone down. You say im not giving him enough credit but The same thing happens on the right. People say Obama didn't do anything but praise trump for the low unemployment rates and economy. You see how that doesn't make sense?
The bottom line is total unemployment the top line is the same stat for African Americans. As you can see a decrease in the unemployment rate has been happening steadily since October of 2009. Long before Trump was in office.
You mean the accordion hands? yeah it‚Äôs what trump ass kissers all do now.
You are so right. Ultimately, we will ALL stand at the Gate in front of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Personally, I've got my OWN *explaining* to do.  But, (again, personally), I think trump* has ALREADY STOOD at the Gate. He was CAST OUT...  Can you say #antichrist ?
Now you know they don‚Äôt know the pronunciation or definition of that big word. Neither does trump.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Economy then go after trump
Not only wasting their vote but helping trump.
That‚Äôs just trump projecting his own qualities.
Yes! This guy nails it. I was furious at the idea that Hank OR Ron Swanson would vote for Trump. You clearly haven‚Äôt watched those characters. Hank‚Äôs growth is the whole show!!!
Donald J TRUMP*  * IS * a PARASITE INDEED.
We do won the popular vote but still lost to a want a be dictator trump so beware electoral college needs to be abolished everyone vote should count republicans cheat with voter suppression gerrymandering and propaganda
I respect what you're going for I am not left or right, and I do recognize the good things that Trump has done, HOWEVER please consider the fact that the man does not support unification of ALL American people, so it's contradictory to your beliefs to support that kind of man imo
I‚Äôm not voting for either of the narcissists. No Trump, No Biden.
Notice how it‚Äôs always a white person when they say ‚Äútrump has done more for the black community than any other president‚Äùü•±ü•±
#DontDoThisAfterSex Run for President Pay hush money  Deny any knowledge Change story Be named "Individual 1'  Remain unindicted co-conspirator #TrumpsAmerica
He is absolutely right though. They provided the dnc valuable russian propaganda to use against President Trump and his team.
I am outraged that you would call trump a white supremacists. Learn some facts chump! Biden has praised Robert Byrd KKK affiliated has said poor kids are just as smart as white kids and told black voters if you don't vote for me then you ain't black
Trump is now kissing Elon‚Äôs ass. Making him ‚Äúpopular‚Äù in Texas with his big commitment for industry.
Born Rich. Pretty sure it featured a young Ivanka Trump too.
Very well said and accurate but the Trump supporters will never understand that because they drink too much of the Trump Kool-Aid and just don't seem to understand that the United States Supreme Court is the Judiciary branch of the government
And sending in what Trump calls Federal policing into our cities to control the violence is very reminiscent of the third right during WWII under Hitler we cannot stand for this I for one am totally against it I will fight to my last breath to stop it
Donald Trump is showing all of the signs of trying to become a fascist dictator of America reminiscent of Mussolini Stalin Franco and others in history We As Americans cannot allow this to happen in our country we need to vote November 3rd and vote Trump's racist xenophobic lying
Mark Zuckerberg is another enabler of trump As Long As Trump is in office Mark Zuckerberg will do whatever Trump wants him to without consequence how do you think Russian interference started in 2016 it was Facebook
Oh but taking your auto-factory away from the workers in California to Texas is a good idea after you've taken millions of dollars from the government is stimulus loans that you don't have to pay back you're a disgrace and you're no better than Donald Trump
On a fucking rope lmao 01 World Series in New York iconic lol trump could never
trump in the White House
This is reminiscent of the Scopes Monkey trial of 1926 when religious sections of America didn't want Evolution taught in the schools another example of more ignorant representation of our country is with keeping our country ignorant and that's what Trump and the Republicans want
This is ABSURD  trump's* LapDog is just as HEARTLESS and VINDICTIVE as the #SnakeInChief
AND trump* AND Barr AND McConnell  AND Stephen Miller AND ALL of the CRONIES that follow this Jim Crow wanna-be, drinking the KOOL-AID like it was water.  This COUNTRY has been deeply affected/damaged by the #SpawnOfSatan. BUT, WE ARE NOT DEFEATED! WE ARE STRONGER THAN THAT! VOTE
President Donald Trump is expected to sign several executive orders related to health care and drug prices at approximately 3 p.m. Friday afternoon. Watch live on Facebook or on our website.
This explains a lot.   is another Trump lackey.
Epstein. Maxwell. Trump. Icky. Shameful.
I think if the statue of liberty came to life, it would destroy one building.    Trump Tower. Lol.
Trump bullies for sure. Poor guy is 79 and wants nothing more than to protect us and serve his country.
Looking forward to softball no pressure questions. Nothing about Ukraine. Nothing about his crime bill. Nothing about his so getting rich because of him. Nothing about his health. They will all be questions about Trump. Nothing personal. He has 50 years of politics he can ask.
Trump has so full of crap. Saying he canceled the convention because his main concern is the American people. What about Tulsa? If he really cared about US- the people, he wouldn‚Äôt lie to us about this virus. It‚Äôs all about votes people.
No fully reopening school for Baron Trump. But his dad wants our kids at risk!
The Mayor‚Äôs of those States want to keep it that way, it doesn‚Äôt matter who gets hurt the want to destroy any change of President Trump getting re-elected
That's one baseball game Trump won't be watching I'm quite sure the rest of the country doesn't give two rats ass as whether he's watching or not play ball
honestly worries me thinking if biden gets elected, what other trump-like person will run/possibly win after biden? and how much more dangerous than trump will they be? if obama ‚Äúcaused‚Äù trump‚Äôs presidency just imagine, what or who will biden ‚Äúcause‚Äù if he hypothetically wins?
You idiots really think the democrats and teacher unions are doing this to keep trump from being re-elected? Keep the economy suffering just to hurt trump? Dear god. We are afraid for our children, our teachers many who are older, and staff.
It‚Äôs a private subdivision. Not sure he would have that authority if he wanted to, which he doesn‚Äôt. trump like destruction, not Joe Biden.
My friend sent me a message about a Trump tweet with a "misleading" picture using an Ukran violence incident and calling it USA's. I tried to Google erroneous tweets and only found Trump. I googled Democratic erroneous tweets and still came up with Trump.
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Donald Trump, the leader of your party, called the KKK ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù
Oh man. I did not realize it was a female democrat. Well, there you go. Trump‚Äôs projections show way to easily. Gross. I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs the reason why now and the fact that it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a woman and not just a facist move makes it kinda grosser? ü§î
President Trump plans to send federal law enforcement agents into more U.S. cities, including Chicago in what‚Äôs being called ‚ÄúOperation Legend,‚Äù but some lawmakers from Illinois say this is a dangerous political stunt.
So your a scientist an everyone should care that you think it‚Äôs stupid?? Let me guess a Trump guy???? People with your thinking are why it‚Äôs spreading like it is. Everything should just b normal huh?? Lol
This guy was never confirmed by the senate and is doing trump‚Äôs dirty work, leading our own 21st century gestapo. Shields and gas masks are not weapons. There is no justification for this sort of violence against peaceful protestors. Get angry if you aren‚Äôt already.
Nope this is with trump you idiot
This makes me cry, that we use to have this, and trump is who we have now. I didn‚Äôt have to pray everyday for not only our troops, but America too. He had faith in America and knew what we could become.
... the #OrangeMadMan is setting all of this in place, now.  When this DEGENERATE becomes the #LOSER and Joe Biden wins, *trump* is facing CRIMINAL CHARGES in New York, and he is *terrified*, ("the likes of which no one has ever seen"). LOOK UP, (GOOGLE)...  MARITAL LAW...
Now, if, by chance, voters DO FIND A WAY TO GET THEIR VOTE REGISTERED, this #OrangeMadMan will have his *Little-Green-Minions* in place so he can REFUSE to accept the LOSS to   trump* THINKS he can REFUSE the results of the November 3rd election.
Trump says it all.  LOL
END THIS NIGHTMARE. TRUMP IS DOING IT FOR YOU, HE SAYS. WE KNOW YOU MEANS, PUTIN.
Make sure you read what is on the truck just for trump.
Hero‚Äôs fight for America, Trump fight against America. Remember this on Nov. 3
This is another tactic of trump trying to make the peaceful protesters,  non peaceful so he can say how he was right about how they are ANGRY MOBS. It is so pass time for him and his goonies to go.
Trump keeps bringing up the fact that he took that cognitive test and passed it because he can't remember that he keeps telling people about it my 78 year old father keeps doing the same thing repeatedly tells me about cousin living in a house when we passed it on the way home
It is. She‚Äôs actually doing her job, unlike trump and republicans.
This dude has his own Island... yet says he relates to the average American more than trump... goofy ass people
Thinking trump has a bounty on all our heads. I don‚Äôt trust him or Putin.
What I don‚Äôt understand, why do they not stand up for America and not Trump? Fora bunch of grown men to act like they are scared of him and have his back, why? I bet when they try to arrest trump he don‚Äôt protect them. He will be squealing like a biatch.
joe biden saying trump is the first racist president is the funniest thing to me. you fool. every president has been racist.
We all know trump can‚Äôt do math or count.
So that‚Äôs a vote for trump.
"The Trump Admin"? How about "American Taxpayers"? Do better
THIS is a trump* follower. WHOO HOO
President Trump and AG Barr are expected to announce Wednesday that federal agents will surge into several American cities including Chicago to help combat rising crime.

The Trump administration has deployed agents with tactical gear to confront protesters in Portland. That has sparked debate over the use of federal power as local and state officials, and many in the community, condemn their tactics and demand they leave.
Federal Government May ‚ÄòFire‚Äô Over 20 Million Americans On Saturday via
Trump hasn‚Äôt failed at everything he set out to do. He became president to stop those that knows his secrets from talking and destroy America in hopes to keep us too busy trying to fix it to worry about his secrets.
I stand with Trump if they kneel im done
I‚Äôm sure he stop talking to him, because others found out, and he had to. I mean trump said it best..if she wasn‚Äôt my daughter, I would date her. He made sexually remarks about her, his own daughter, at a young age. I‚Äôm sorry, fathers don‚Äôt talk like that, they kill those who do!
Getting to watch what trump stands for as a man, who uses his white privileged to not follow any laws, because he also has money, which he cheated his own family to get, make me know he is a child molester.
I‚Äôm thinking you did not have to say real man, she just needs a man. And trump knows this. He isn‚Äôt letting go of her hand in case she goes in for the kiss.  If trump knows anything, it would be that woman he married manipulative him, until they get enough in writing $ and leave.
I wouldn‚Äôt shed a tear if you moved. I am not sure what you call compassionate and caring, but mocking someone being killed, and calling people out of their names by body shaming, they‚Äôre stupid if they disagree with him. I don‚Äôt like bullies and thatis what trump is to Americans
trump is only an expert on himself.
Donald Trump needs a convention more than Joe Biden. So he‚Äôs going to have one, no matter what.
Brainwashing by trumpTrump‚Äôs problem is that he never exited campaign mode. His motivation for being president is simply that he wants to be president, devoid of any real policy (and because he took a Black man being elected president as a personal affront).
I really believe to be a Republican these days you have to be brain dead if you support Trump.
Donald Trump Asks to Delay Presidential Election
You need to track down the connection to trump
You know he isn‚Äôt president if he doesn‚Äôt get *voted* in. January 20th 2021 the speaker of the house, most likely a DEMOCRAT, becomes president.  So... sure. Don‚Äôt hold an election.  The constitution protects us feom Trump this way.   #haha #nicetry
Voting third party is not a vote for Trump. The 42% of eligible voters who opted out of the 2016 election ensured he won. We need third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, (etc) patties for an actual democracy!
The last public event that he attended was the Trump rally in Tulsa...
Trump floats November election delay ‚Äì but only Congress can do that
Not sure which would be worse... biden, trump, or pelosi...i keep puking trying to decide.

Aww the pedophile supporter thinks information a week behind spoonfed by politicians is close to the truth. When journalists join the politicians it has never been a good thing. trump's lap dog is willing spreading lies that will get people killed.

It doesn't get any better than TRUMP. He loves this country.
Has anyone ever thought about Trump being a sperm donor! Just think that one through....
Trump is visiting an oil rig in Midland Texas, my son Cody is installing a system of robots in an oil field on oil rigs in Midland Texas....  yikes
Hardly surprising considering Trump and his dad were sued by the Justice Department for housing discrimination in the 1970s.
The Swamp attacks  relentlessly. The collateral damage in this grotesque war against our President is the American people.   The Trump economy is roaring back but Dems will stop at nothing to halt the President‚Äôs work. In reality they‚Äôre attacking our way of life.
I'm voting Biden but not because I support him. Honestly I don't think the country can handle another 4yrs of trump. I also don't think that accelerationism is going to solve everything. It's not a good strategy. I wouldn't shame people for not voting because I understand.
Does it have to go through Trump? Are others not defying the Supreme Court? Impeach every single one.
Trump is not actually the problem. He is part of the cancer that has killed our country but you could remove him from history and though it would be a good thing... nothing actually changes. The Justice System/police would still be a problem, Billionaires would still run it all.
Trump country
There is no difference in trump and biden other than sound bites...war is actually more likely under a dem. At least the cheetoking is an isolationist. War is good for an economy based around the military industrial complex. It's coming...

Don't compare things that don't happen with things that do. Individual voter fraud is extremely rare - large-scale voter suppression is an ongoing crisis.

"Trump furious over military ban on Confederate flags" Trump is a racist treasonous Nazi pig and and an enemy of this country! He should be taken out on the WH lawn and shot by firing squad as a warning to the rest of the American Nazis in this country! The south were traitors!!!

The Republican Party pursued the Southern strategy for several decades and now Trump continues to rail against BLM, is in the process of sending troops to Chicago and Oakland (wtf?) and is now talking about suburbs being invaded by ‚Äúthose kind of people‚Äù.

How much longer would the pot have kept from spilling over if Derek Chauvin hadn't murdered George Floyd? If Trump really wanted to end any rioting, all he would have to do is remove the rioters legitimacy by facilitating police reform that protesters agree with. 1/

trump is a fascist
When China unleashed COVID-19 unto the world,  saved countless lives with his temporary travel ban.   The #NoBanAct would undermine President Trump's authority in protecting our country's national security.   We must not limit this authority &amp; responsibility.
And the leftist were worried Trump and Right Wingers wouldn't accept election results...
COVID-19 was unleashed onto the world by China.  ¬†  now sides with Communist China by calling it the "Trump Virus."  Nancy, we‚Äôre both old enough to know what I mean when I say you‚Äôve officially ‚Äújumped the shark.‚Äù
Of course. trump‚Äôs corruption is being allowed. Changes need to be made to the office of presidency to lessen its power. No man should be able to pardon crooks period.

Nobody folded, tbh most of us just said, "i told you so", and then crossed "trump wants to change election" off our 2020 bingo cards.
Maybe President Trump should tell everyone he likes mail in voting.  That way dems would never let it pass
And Russian/China interference? How are we set for that? Let‚Äôs call it like it is. Trump is so incompetent that he thinks he has the power to change the date of/rig a presidential election. You people, by standing idly by and doing nothing have created a monster.

Herman Cain died from COVID-19 which he contracted from Trump‚Äôs rally at Tulsa, OK, where no one wore masks or practiced social distancing. #TrumpKilledHermanCain
A better line would be,   "Postmaster General, Trump Appointee, is considering closing post offices across the country, sparking concerns ahead of an anticipated surge in mail-in ballots."  The U.S. Postal Service isn't doing this, Louis Dejoy is.
Do you think that the COVID-19 pandemic helped cause the low numbers? If not what do you feel he could have done to make the numbers better? Not at all in support of trump just a curious supporter of you.

Donald tRump:  at your funeral, NO ONE will speak this glowingly and lovingly for your lifelong deeds because you have done nothing for mankind
Cain decided to go and not follow science recommendations. Trump should not have held the rally but Cain decided to go so there is no sympathy from me. I hate wearing a mask and social distancing but it is what we must do to try to stop spread of virus.
I just spent ten minutes trying to figure out why #TimAllen is trending. If it‚Äôs about cocaine in the 70‚Äôs ummm who cares?? Seriously it was the 70‚Äôs??? Plus umm again who cares??? We have bigger fish to deep fry like ummm.. the other entitled racist #Trump as in #WeWillVote out!

President Donald Trump floated delaying the November presidential election ‚Äî¬†which he can't do ‚Äî warning that mail-in voting will create a "fraudulent election."  # via  MT: he floated it and the American citizens flushed it. #HellNo
That would be great if they actually thought it through. But they don‚Äôt. Critical thinking is not a skill Trump voters possess.
Donald Trump, President of the United States is not doing his job. He must clear out and in so cases arrest his cronies and enablers. If he can‚Äôt do it, then he should resign and let Joe do it for him. We will not be quiet until we are safely rid of you
It‚Äôs the trump era

This is why people don't like trumpanzees.   The people just get ruder and ruder.  More ignorant and more likely to cause physical harm to others.  And trump stands there encouraging people to do it, he riles you up,  he knows that he is pandering to uneducated people.
When liberals make fun of President Trump,  do you think they look at their party of democratic clowns?   Seriously??
if trump spent as much time reading his morning briefings as he does tweeting incoherent things on twitter we would be in far less catastrophes.
The asshattery of this is beyond explanation. #Narcissism #Avoidance #Gaslighting #Misinformation #Trump
Trump will pardon him. So long as he doesn‚Äôt squeal.
Obama didn't have an anti-segregation policy.  He tried to force neighborhoods to lower their housing standards. Trump is right again for getting rid of it.
It wasn‚Äôt by accident but has to keep the front up. Trump might be watching.
I‚Äôve become a Trump fan of late. Say it ain‚Äôt so?! WTH. I live in the suburbs and this is offensive.  Is this a legit post?
Dear Midland Texas, trump is beholden to the Saudis your jobs are a bargaining tool to him. HOOK LINE AND SINKER.
Your followers don't seem to agree. 8 hours without any interactions.  Additionally #DNCFraudLawsuit exposed the rampant manipulations BY the corporation known as the DNC because donors were lied to by DWS &amp; others  Finally-I thought it was Russia &amp; Bernie bros that helped Trump?
trump's defense of Putin and Russia is rather unbecoming. Had there been a  prophesy that a US  president would be a strenuous protagonist of Russia in my lifetime, I would have dismissed it as mere bunkum and baldadash. But of course he is a MAGA-"Moscow Agent Governing America"
U democrats took all that money before the Chinese coronavirus hit that was for replenishing stock of masks gloves&amp;ventilators&amp;spent it on what .whats did u  do with all that money .then you blamed trump ... dems are evil ...dems and dems media lie lie lie till fools believe um
Trump even sent a ship fully staffed to New York and the east coast in record time and you still sent sick coronavirus people to the most vulnerable in nursing homes ... you dem are all liars and cheater ... vote all democrats out of office they are destroying America. Trump 2020
You are such a great liar . You all called trump racist back in January when he stopped China from coming to America... YOU DEMS cause at least half of all the deaths when you put china coronavirus peopl in nursing home when you know NH pts were the most vulnerable.
This project must have been overlooked by Trump‚Äôs comprehensive infrastructure program!
nailed him to the wall #Trump never has anything true or good to say when it comes to the #RussianBounty controversy
Trump administration weighing drug testing for food stamps
Where does that $ for testing come from? Federal funds are going to start drying up if Trump continues his stance. IHSAA has to be hurting financially. Tough decision but if you‚Äôre playing, you may have to limit family contact in season. High risk may need to self-isolate.
Regardless of what republicans say trump setting America back in time by undoing the progress Obama accomplished is not a accomplishment at all. America has not moved forward with time.

Trump accepted the doctors around him from day 1. Trump has been on top from day 1. Lack of morals? You are not the judge of anyone's morals. Turn off the TV. You sound foolish.
Failed? Haha. Trump Tower is world class. The resorts are world class. Incest? Haha. You are sucking up the media lies like few have done.
Of course you don't as he doesn't fit your twisted hate Trump agenda. The Democrats states are the problem not the POTUS. Yes, leadership failure with these governors. Trump has always been a leader. As POTUS he's done a good job. Much better than the prior one.
You're jealous of him, his sons and his daughter aren't you? They are successful and you are not. That's ok, most people are not as successful as the Trump's.
He didn't tell Cuomo to put COVID positives in nursing homes did he? You have no idea what you are talking about. Trump didn't cause you to have another bad day or for you to be poorly educated with no common sense. That is on you.
He didn't make things worse. Governors such as Cuomo who forced nursing homes to take in COVID positives made things worse. That is NY not Trump. You are not a clear thinker you are a media tool.
The administration was serious from day 1. The Gov of NY forced nursing homes to take in COVID positives. That wasn't Trump. Are you not aware of that? Europe has been hammered. Only a preschooler would try and blame the POTUS for deaths related to a virus. That is you.
You're the one having trouble comprehending. The media is counting on your ignorance. America isn't dying at all. We have the same virus the rest of the world has and bunch of thugs on our streets. Both will pass. Shut down wasn't because of Trump it was because of the virus.
It's the least Joe could do for such an honest woman. Sounds like Kamala Harris has the honor of being the most "used African American" in U.S. history by the Democratic Party.  Realizing they have no chance with Joe Biden, they can use Kamala as a prop to prove Trump as racist.
Twitter temporarily limits Trump Jr.‚Äôs account over COVID-19 video

Just so the Barr/tRump Goon Squad &amp; their families know: If one of these Gestapo Stormtrooper should get seriously hurt or Covid sick, that nurse you gassed &amp;  knocked over will do her damnedest to save your life.  THAT is the difference you do not see.  (PS lay off the anabolics
That‚Äôd only happen if someone locked Trump in the basement cell within a phone! Narcissist can‚Äôt control themselves, so it‚Äôll never happen! Nice joke though!! #sundayvibes #COVID-19
Social media has become the target of a dueling attack ad campaign being waged online by the sitting president and his election rival --
Well until this administration totally failed them, I would say pretty good. But since trump and his lackeys screwed the pooch on the TRUMPVIRUS response, not so good. The question is , why do you still have one?
Nancy really is useless. She has been enabling Trump since he took office.
4/4 A person (especially a teen girl walking her dog!) should be able to live their life without fear of verbal - or physical  attacks. But we can‚Äôt. This is Trump‚Äôs America.
3/4 And don‚Äôt even  me w/any comments that Trump isn‚Äôt the cause. Watch. His. Rallies. Watch interviews &amp; briefings in real time &amp; read the transcripts if you don‚Äôt trust ‚Äúthe media.‚Äù His vile vitriol has emboldened a group of people who before were merely keyboard ‚Äúwarriors‚Äù.
2/4 She quickly pulled off her bandeau to use as a mask as she passed by (six to 10 feet away). As she did that, a man who was driving by began screaming at her for wearing a mask. He called her a b This is Trump‚Äôs America. And I‚Äôm beyond sickened by it.
Is Rudy Giuliani a bootlicking sychophant, tethered to trump through years of mob ties? Discuss.
I hope this photo makes its way into history books to capture the reality of the kind of people who enabled tRump.  Disgusting
I mean, when you declare war on people they gonna fight back. This aint the end, and your president is incapable. Protestors pushing anybody trump sends. Yall making shit worse, im not sure what is wrong to keep ya'll from comprehending that.
‚ÄúTrump!Take Heed from those who have gone before you and who tried for the best in this democratic land! Repent while you still draw breath! If you remain on your doomed path, there is nothing any of us can do to intercede/save you from the hellfire &amp; damnation that awaits you.‚Äù
Have been watching this all morning. Carlin‚Äôs comments are true still today. And, that‚Äôs the hardest part of watching. #Trump #TwoAmericas
Cornyn, Gomert, Crenshaw, Cruz, Trump A laugh a minute. Ffs
So sick of your lies&amp; you dems are the ones dividing our country.stop enough from you dems&amp;dems media.they lie lie lie till fools believe um .no to socialism/communism. Dems all need to move to Venezuela we Americans don‚Äôt want you here...Trump 2020 and beyond trump puts USA 1st
A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research also finds Trump‚Äôs approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic falling to a new low, with just 32% of Americans supportive of his approach. --
Kinda like what the patriots are facing with Portland‚Äôs Gestapo stormtroopers in tRump and disBARR‚Äôs perfect trumpian autocracy
Wayne dunlapped the tRump schlock
Being fully informed about the false narratives pushed by corporate media isn't a cult.  Criticizing the lies &amp; bad policies promoted by the establishment Dems is NOT defending Trump.  Police Brutality is excessive and does effect minority &amp; poor communities disproportionately.
The countdown begins. Only 100 days left until Election Day ‚Äì‚Äì we must be energized to elect Republicans up and down the ballot and re-elect President Trump! Let's make them count! #IN08
When you say the quiet things out loud. üò≥ü§îü§¨ #Trump
Yeah, it‚Äôs been bad everywhere. But, only #Trump and #DeSantis have tried to say they‚Äôve slam dunked/ beaten the virus (multiple times, too). And, #Trump is golfing again today?
Sacrifice, Trump once again using a culture of people as a visual aide for support and recognition.. now the biker community as a whole will be frown upon
I am so not in the mood for Donald Trump‚Äôs garbage today.
How? Provide any statement or action of Trump's that emboldens them.
And speaking and illegals, Obama rounded up and deported more of them than Trump. Does that mean Obama's platform was anti-brown?
Trump doesn't have a militia. Do you understand that term? If you did you wouldn't be using it in that manner. What white militia? This is a bad group.
Ah Lindsey, Lindsey.  You have lost your way.  You have lost your soul. You have lost your integrity. You have lost your honor.                   You have found tRump.
Keep kickin ass Mr Trump! And if you ever need a haircut come see me. Free of charge!
tRump threw his balls away long time ago
Mr. Trump, you must know that the many problems in our current economy, pandemic, race wars, etc. is killing your chances of re-election in November.   Maybe you're just tired of dealing with the mess I'm afraid you, yourself caused.
Mr. Trump, i hate to say I've been against you since before you were elected.  Ive cringed at your tweets and prayed that one day you'd wake up.  Lately I'm seeing a real person in you.  Makes me smile.
Trump and the Republican Party is the greatest threat to America. Biden must win.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Republicans are too ignorant to know that they are only there to use them as tools üõ† and everyone knows what trump does to tools when he‚Äôs done with them üóë.
It‚Äôs already been proven that republicans are hiding the #s so trump won‚Äôt look like the idiot he is.
Trump‚Äôs militias trying spread across America, üõë stop them so they don‚Äôt.
He took a nice payday from trump I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a I owe u agreement
Reagan Foundation to Trump, RNC: Quit raising money off Ronald Reagan‚Äôs legacy
What do you call the ones that trump sent to Portland and Michigan.
Is there anyone else on earth (besides tRump) more ignorant, more ridiculous, more obtuse, and more laughable than Florida‚Äôs Governor Ron deSantis?  How the hell did he ever get elected?  Did he never open his mouth to speak?  Has ANYTHING sensible ever fallen out of his mouth?
Thank God!!!!!   The BEST reason EVER to vote for Biden!!! tRump‚Äôs version of America is not unlike Dante‚Äôs Inferno‚Äôs Seven Circles of Hell.  (No divine comedy to be sure)
That is false. The thugs in BLM and Antifa are committing the violence. Blaming Trump is as dumb as you can get.
I have a joke about trump, but I‚Äôm tied up at the moment.
Trump still has 6 months at least. Education is not from a newspaper. That is propaganda. I never pledged blind faith to any politician. He is no fraud. He is POTUS. Who is conning? Why would he steal from me? He cut my tax rates. That's not stealing.
Cambridge Analytica is the operation Trump HIRED to target FB accounts that leaned more favorably in his direction-They ain't Russia. Mueller Report admitted they found no evidence Crowdstrike admitted they found no evidence US Intel agencies presented no evidence
#TwoAmericas, and sometimes, it takes an outside perspective to see/read about what‚Äôs really happening. #Trump
Who told that Trump's platform was brown people bad?
Nothing in Trump's platform is anti-brown people. Did the tax cuts exclude brown people and brown businesses? Name any Trump policy that is "brown people bad".
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Why does donnie tRump come to mind?
Wray needs to be fired. When Trump is re-elected Wray will be the first one GONE
This stupid idiot has never met Trump. Her grandparent kick her out of his will. That says a lot of what kind of person she is. She was disowned by the family. She just wants to cash in on his name. Lying comes easy for her
We need to build a wall around trump and never let him out. Only after he is in prison that is
You do not know anything about Trump. You have never met him and you have never been around him. You know nothing. Why didn't you read anything about Obama/Biden and Russia? Because the media didn't make it a story. You are being played.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Not flagged for his attention. Do you understand what that means? And again, why didn't Biden and Obama do anything about it? What do you want Trump to do, start a war?
Good. BLM and Antifa have been killing people and injuring the police. An officer is now blind. Several are dead. A 24 year old woman in Indy is dead. Dozens of people are dead from these "protests". Trump doesn't need to create scary photos, BLM and Antifa are doing it for him.
American citizens being stacked in refrigerated trucks after they died from Covid, 6 million families added to the food assistance ranks, tens of millions unemployed, 4+ million cases of Covid 19. How was your golf game with Donald Trump today?
Yes, unverified info goes into the report. Again, the same bounty went on under Obama Biden. What did they do? Even Iran had bounties on US troops. What did Obama and Biden do? Do you want Trump to bomb Russia?
The info wasn't provided to Trump. It was never verified just as it was never verified under Obama. It was also going on under Biden and Obama. What did they do? Do you understand the report that this was in?
What sources did the NYT use? Unnamed, again? The Russian bounty story was going on under Obama. Did you not know that? The intelligence didn't pass it to Trump because it was not confirmed just like under Obama. But you actually think the NYT is a good source? hahaha
This isn't Trump's militia. This is yours. We voted for change in 2016. It's been great. You want to go back to the bad. We are not a Democracy. We have a Democratic process that the Democrats, BLM and Antifa, your kind, want to destroy.
Trump isn't inciting violence. Have you been paying attention. BLM, Antifa and the Democrats are inciting violence.
Stop the pandemic, fix the economy, then go after Trump.
Rep. John Lewis, he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to attend Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration! When you can‚Äôt say any thing positive about one‚Äôs demise, It is better to say nothing at all. I choose to remain SILENT!
If it wasn‚Äôt for low class, Trump would have no class at all.
Shot reported as #NFAC was gathering to march, before the event hit the streets. Militia groups didn't "face" off. Not that Trump won't use the Daily Beast story as an excuse
Let‚Äôs hope the silent majority rises with a resounding victory for Trump
A real father would settle for nothing less than ‚Äúno risk‚Äù.
Well you take your medical advice from a two bit grifter. Who‚Äôs also a pedophile. So you are trusting the health of your children to a con man who raped a thirteen year old?
Trump made Regis‚Äô death about himself, natch.
Ok Joe you have issues coming out of basement.  Need to debate President Trump
The convention‚Äôs official business will go on as planned in Charlotte, North Carolina but exactly where and how the president will accept his nomination remains to be seen. --
Florida, more than anywhere, is experiencing the ramifications of Trump‚Äôs ineptitude. Biden is the only choice. #BidenForFL
I disagree with  on nearly everything.  I admire him for seeing the president for who he is‚Äîand being a voice of reason on the subject.  On most things I appreciate, but vehemently disagree with Kristol‚Äôs stance. That‚Äôs the American way.  Trump is just a nut.
The trouble is:  1 yr ago to de-fund police was absurd. 2 yrs ago blocking church services 5 yrs ago tearing down statues of Lincoln  6 yrs ago Trump becoming president. The radical progressives make the absurd their goal.

The coalition of states, cities, and counties is led by New York Attorney General Letitia James. --
