I'm not going political but Biden wants a woman for VP.... But not Hillary??  Something about all this doesn't add up...
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP AGREE WITH TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY APPROVE OF HIS PERFORMANCE.  OBAMA  SAYS BIDEN IS NOT HEALTHY.  BIDEN WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE SAID HE WAS IN VERMONT.  HAD ON NO MASK. INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY ON SPYING ON TRUMP.
Honest question for all people who are voting Biden  What line does Biden have to cross to lose your vote? What issue? What tragedy would he have to be a part of that he already isn't?  I ask this in seriousness, because Biden crossed that line a long time ago imo
Your new poll doesn't state the obvious, how did you do the poll?   deserves better form Fox. #FakeNewsFOX
She is absolutely sane, and her theory of demonic possession is the best explanation ever for what has happened to the former Democrat party.  Just take a look at Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden's recent rants. #HowToExplainDemocrats
Keep dreaming. Biden will never make President of this country. It‚Äôs good you have a dream though.
Do you referring to Biden‚Äôs cervix Agenda?
Black people that weren‚Äôt voting anyway are always looking for a reason to validate it. They were already mad at Biden for the 90s. Kamala would be the icing on the cake. Susan Rice would be attacked for Benghazi. It‚Äôs a Catch 22.
I do not know how many clones joe used while he was a senator? Or if he even used one bat all?   joe &amp; hunter biden, are on on this list üëâ

They will hammer Biden and the VP pick. I suspect a turn to "immigrants" again at some point. Also, he will try to make amends to his sliding evangelical base, perhaps antiabortion or LGBTQ+ policy.ü§î
If Trump wins will Biden concede? Probably Not! A National mail in ballot is risky, for those concerned with Covid request an absentee ballot, states can also open for early voting my State does this.
Dude, your profile is all ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù garbage. You‚Äôre not fooling anyone that you are a reasonable person. It‚Äôs ridiculous to pretend that Biden isn‚Äôt better than Trump. You‚Äôre not convincing any rational people with this nonsense.

OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  RACIST, VOTED WITH THE KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS AGAINST MINORITIES.  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES.  POLLS INCLUDE DEMOCRAT SHOWS, DEMENTIA.
Or we could just scream at the ~27,000,000 unemployed Americans ‚Äúget a job you lazy bums!!‚Äù within a job market with ~5,000,000 available positions (most of which they don‚Äôt qualify for). Then we could sleep easy at night knowing the problem is laziness, not the GOP. /s
For the same reason polls show Biden besting Trump. It‚Äôs all BS.
BIDEN IS ABOUT 80 YRS OLD WITH ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS &amp; RACIST.  VOTED WITH KKK AGAINST MINORITIES.  IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID IN VERMONT, DIDN'T HAVE ON MASK.  OBAMA'S PHYSICIAN SAID BIDEN IS NOT HEALTHY.  BRAIN SURGERIES, DEMENTIA.
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP FOUND TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN ANY PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM.  NORC- CENTER POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASM THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP.  BIDEN WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID HE WAS IN VERMONT, NO MASK ON.
One of the top priorities of the Biden administration should be to expand the Supreme Court.
Im okay with it as long as Dr Biden is consulted on the remodel. She will after all be the one living in it long term
Amen. Our country is an embarrassment. I miss Obama so fucking much. I‚Äôm not quite confident Biden can pull us out of this bullshit but he‚Äôs the only option which is also bullshit but whatever.
Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, subpoenaed the State Department Friday demanding copies of documents that  has already provided to   investigating
Also, Biden did the cardinal sin by eliminating a gender by committing to picking a women ( which I am 100% for).
I guess Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd aren't thinking about what happens if Biden wins two terms. We need a strong v.p. to be ready in 8 years and  would be that v.p.
It will. They always do. Particularly post Labor Day. Everyone beating off over Biden in July is silly.
Joe Biden or Donald Trump is going to win the election, no one else. It‚Äôs a two-party system and as much as I hate it, there isn‚Äôt anything I can do about it. So in the most important election in recent history, I‚Äôm not wasting my vote on someone who stands no shot at winning.
"Gaffe  wait, don't do it to us, don't choose a #FarLeft candidate to run with you "Gaffe Joe"...the harmful policies like of the "Squad" MUST be rejected especially by you...pick someone moderate...don't sell us out!
You know whose name is mentioned as one of the co-sponsors in the Violence Against Women Act wiki entry?  Joe Biden.
It's a shame you didn't win the nomination.  You are data driven and look at things logically.  Instead we are left with Biden and Trump. I'm a Republican so will vote anti-Trump, if you had won the nomination I would have voted for you and not just notTrump.

Yep. Not taking hot takes from any white man about Biden's VP pick. Screw that.
Is he wrong? Have you not seen the idiots protesting and burning shit and killing people? It may not be half but it‚Äôs probably not far from it. Hell, according to your hero Biden the US population is almost all dead from the Covid virus
Of all the heavily rumored Biden VP choices, Karen Bass would be the best
Thank you President Biden
Is anyone else wondering if the current administration will have to be forcibly removed from the WH? And will he skip out on Biden being sworn in? I mean, those things on his level of classlessness. And what will 11/4-1/20 look like? What a shit show this will be.
Probably the biggest nerd herd I have ever seen. Can you imagine being under 30 and supporting Biden in early February?
You can call it shorthand. It‚Äôs not shorthand. It‚Äôs a damn lie. If Biden or any democrat spoke this way you‚Äôd be calling them a liar. But it‚Äôs Trump so it‚Äôs shorthand.
Biden is not an elected official yet. He has zero responsibility to hold Trump accountable. Nowhere in the constitution does it say ‚Äúthe executive branch shall be held in check by the opposing party‚Äôs candidate‚Äù. That is a ridiculous position.
Put a big ass Biden sign in your yard and you‚Äôll realize there‚Äôs a lot of hope right now. People even say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù
Should be the pitch poster for Biden but also show potential cabinet position in a Biden administration.
I don't even need to know who Biden's running mate it. I'm sure she'll be fabulous.

It's the Karl Rove playbook. They are desperate to project Trump's weaknesses onto Biden.

Biden did a great job creating jobs as part of the Obama administration.    Trump inherited a strong economy.

Oh the Dems have an October surprise planned but it will either be another virus more deadly than the first, or it will be releasing the cops who killed Floyd on a technicality so there will be more rioting and less voting. Then they plan to claim Biden won &amp; fake news will help.
Democrats must realize that foreign policy is just as important as domestic. No way around it. Biden is the right guy for international issues. Domestic is very important. Just do not forget outside our borders.
You can't delay the election, Biden won't let you.

Little Richard can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden. Even though Little Richard is dead. He completed his mail-in ballot while sitting in the waiting room to hear what St. Peter had to say. Or maybe it was an illegal immigrant who filled out the mail-in ballot.Who really knows who voted?
No, but with Trump trailing Biden by double digits in the polls there aren't a lot of takers for the role.
Yes it is  Obama and Biden trashed it
Something fishy is going on. Biden is very quiet. Seems like he knows the election is in the bag. What does he and the Democrats doing?  Something smells fishy?
Agreed. Your comment reminded me of this article from earlier this year on the eulogies Biden‚Äôs delivered.
Joe Biden finally crawls out of his basement. The Left tested hundreds of COVID vaccines on him to try to keep him alive until Election Day
Joe Biden tweeted this from a land line on an autogyro
the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don‚Äôt really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
I‚Äôm sorry, but I won‚Äôt believe _any_ of these people until I see their completed ballots and how much money they donate to Biden‚Äôs campaign. In other words, I will _never_ believe these people. Performative outrage is all this is.
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn‚Äôt inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn‚Äôt enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.
From Obama's mouth to God's ears!! Biden/Warren 2020
Postal worker union endorsed Biden and we should allow them to handle the election they can even ship packages for Amazon without getting fucked  If you can protest and riot in person you can vote in person
James, it‚Äôs simple brother. It‚Äôs common sense. Biden is in bed with china, they tried to take out Trump, it didn‚Äôt work, so China unleashed the virus. They figured the people they were paying here weren‚Äôt getting the job done, so they did it themselves
Mr. Secretary, you took Con Law at a more prestigious school than I did, but I aced l &amp; ll so apparently I got more out of it than you did. There's no "legal determination" to make. He doesn't have that power. He's just trying to plant seeds illegitimacy when Biden wins.
45 drops out at the last minute to give GOP boost in votes w/ Pence.   Maybe enough to beat a candidate like Biden who‚Äôs best attribute is that he‚Äôs better than 45  Barr charges Trump with all of his crimes, Pence pardons him allowing him to keep his stolen $ and stay out of jail
Practice what you preach Biden
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.

I disagree. Haven‚Äôt we learned how much smoke he blows? The results will be convincing (Biden wins by at least 5 points) and Trump exits stage left.
No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
Only way that happens is if he leaves office early. Biden won‚Äôt grant it. He politically can‚Äôt. Already has a tenuous relationship with progressives.
FWIW: i'm NEVER voting for Biden. u can ask me bout it if u want. just trying to share info w/ each other &amp; discuss not judge or start shi*
Bernie definitely secures more than 5% in each of his runs and didn‚Äôt have to drop out in shame because of plagiarism and lies (Biden.) Thats to be expected from the guy that still lies today that his wife and son were killed by a drunk driver. his supporters seem to do the same.

If it weren't for FDR and Lincoln..but he's in that conversation. He's that amazing. And I wish every moment he could run again. I wonder if Biden can pick him as VP
So the last time we saw Biden, he said he was going to prosecute ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù, which is just code word for protestors. They tried this with ‚Äúcannabis smokers‚Äù in the 70s. Nixon literally said you can‚Äôt prosecute being left or black so they just went after pot smokers.

John Lewis said he remembered Hillary Clinton in the Civil Rights movement.  Hillary was a Goldwater girl during the movement, and the Clintons never did a thing for blacks.  Check out the 1994 Crime Act, written by Joe Biden for Bill Clinton.  It has decimated black families.
You see how much money I got on the catch?! I was thrilled. Biden is so jealous!

Your bizarre attack on Joe Biden in the primaries could have damaged our chances to beat Trump. Based on this, it seems you are not disciplined or dedicated enough to be the VP pick.  You seem more like a selfish opportunist than a future potus.

I tend to agree. Leadership should come from the top down and Trump has not shown that. Unfortunately, Biden has been in politics a long time and hasn't been that man either, which takes me back to the wish (dare I say prayer) that another option will appear.
Because today is about John Lewis? Not Joe Biden,
I‚Äôm not actually sure anyone is on the Biden train lmao
Despite what they claim, Democrats have no desire to return to "norms." Their goals under a Biden presidency will be to impose the most far-reaching liberal policies in history. They will do it by sheer brute force with no regard for "norms."
A lot of us aren't considering Biden as settling but I get your point.
For Biden's allies, his closing argument to people of faith comes down to that: You can't reclaim the soul of a nation without first taking seriously the state of your own.
His suggestion came minutes after the Commerce Department announced that the nation‚Äôs GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced, fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30, the largest quarterly drop on record.
What a joke. We know you're a Trojan for Russia, now you want to project on Biden?  He's working with Americans, not a foreign country. He's far from radical left. You're just bluster.  Can't even organize a pandemic response when a 'pandemic for dummies' manual was there for you
So, Karen?  The Clintons are running this show.  They want Harris.  Jill Biden wants to be First Lady.

That Trump is a racist, white supremist, etc are widely-used democrat talking points that I don‚Äôt subscribe to. I wonder if Carol Folt subscribes!? Would she come out and endorse Joe Biden for President? She seems to have a political bent and maybe wants to unburden herself.
Biden must be picking #Oprah for VP. She is Trump‚Äôs biggest enemy. #OprahWinfrey for VP!!!

Well Joe 'babble' Biden learned to lead from behind from Obama so now he can lead from behind in the basement.
If nobody voted. Biden would still get 60m+ votes....
I don't know Chris Wallace's bookers and don't work for the Biden campaign. I think what Trump advocates should worry about is his success/failure at communicating a message that isn't seen as weak/addled. Take me off the thread. Thanks.

He wasn't voting for Biden so he wasn't black.  Their racism has been exposed for a while.  Now they will say "He sought safety in the mindless ideology of the right, and he paid the ultimate price for it."
Even after Harris did her solid and withheld her endorsement of Joe Biden until Warren dropped out. Harris respects the sisterhood even if Warren doesn't.
White electorate in SC grew 112% and went overwhelmingly for biden. Believe what you want about extremely obvious things
South Carolina was a majority white dem primary electorate for the first time in 50 years due to Republicans coming en masse to vote for biden. Personally I think it's great that we're listening to Republicans and pretending it's black voices being heard
Clouded judgement all around for sure. The blind loyalty piece seems to be heavier on one side considering every dem will tell you Biden is a dumb fuck. With media maybe our perception is mostly what our friends share rather than actual outlets and friends share their bias
Once Biden is elected we need to teach Mr Putin a lesson he will not forget about meddling in other nations. We need to increase our NATO presence, engage in cyber warfare and put economic sanctions on Russia that will cripple Putin's hold on his enslaved people. Putin must go.
I‚Äôm also noticing a lot more desperation from demoratic socialists as well. Bashing Biden and the DNC while praising Trump...
Calling it now:  will be  VP pick. She‚Äôs the only one who can truly energize their base. Big Mike would then become President after they toss Biden aside and invoke the 25th Amendment. And then this country is officially toast.
So  how are you feeling today? Still think Biden owes an apology?
Make summer a slow news cycle again.   Just floating winning messages for Team Biden.

As President Donald Trump's poll numbers continue to decline among people of faith, the Biden campaign is hoping that the authenticity of Biden's personal story, and, in particular, his Catholic faith will offer a stark moral contrast to Trump.
It was good until they showed Biden and I remembered that's the DNC's real plan.
Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Here are the Vegas odds
DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP BIDEN LOCKED AWAY IN HIS BASEMENT SO THE VOTERS CAN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT BIDEN'S DECLINING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.  OBAMA'S PHYSICIAN SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.   RACIST, VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS AGAINST MINORITIES.
And no, of course that's not THE reason the market is doing well right now. Not that simple obviously. Just like saying if Biden wins, the market will crash. Same scare tactics used in every election.
Exactly. Biden supporters are now telling me that in addition to holding my nose and voting for his establishment plans, I just need to wait for his VP in four years. Then things will reallllly change.  ... I don't get it.
So do you think Kamala Harris will get off her knees infront of Willie Brown and get selected for Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 80 YEARS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES.  POLLS EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  CNBC POLL SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM OF TRUMP'S VOTERS  CREATES HEADLINES.  UNDER SAMPLING OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
That‚Äôs a lie on both counts , Harris will drag Biden down with her CJ record She adds nothing to the ticket
This is just not accurate , she couldn‚Äôt run her own campaign well &amp; didn‚Äôt make one Primary   She will drag Biden , the only people that want her are people who blindly follow without Objectively reviewing her record

a lot of the people complaining about joe biden being the democratic nominee didn‚Äôt bother voting during the primaries but y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt ready for that conversation yet
I‚Äôve seen several tweets like this. Some even suggesting Kamala orchestrated her own attack to trap Biden into picking her. ü§¨Truly cannot comprehend that Kamala doesn‚Äôt need to engineer anything. Her creds stand on their own merit and they cannot stand it.
Silver Alert! #SleepyJoeBiden's mind is missing! Can anyone find it by Nov 2020? Biden can't do interviews without pre scripted questions and the answers on the his teleprompter for #SleepyJoeBiden to try and read.  Vote #GOP

Biden is so awful there is no VP choice that will save that ticket. S**t sandwich 2020.
Gosh. When did we last have a VP who wasn't ambitious? Pence has ambitions of a cozy life deep in trump's ass. Biden clearly had ambitions. Cheney was a fucking megalomaniac. Gore wanted to be POTUS. So did Quayle. Why, this almost sounds like racist/misogynistic bullshit.
I don't believe it. I feel like it's a ploy to bring Joe Biden poll numbers down. Don't fall for the okie-doke
Gotta be the actual campaign making them. Very disciplined with using all the right colors and fonts, grammar &amp; style is consistent, and seems like they have an encyclopedic library of non-public Biden images to choose from.
I disagree, i have a strong feeling (unfortunately) Trumps gonna get re-elected. Biden isn't a democratic favorite. People just aren't going to vote. But yes AOC is definitely a front runner. Definitely hope Biden wins tho.
There's no rule that says Michelle Obama couldn't be Biden's running mate, if she wanted the gig but Barack can't do it because he's already served 2 terms as POTUS.
The Clintons anointed Harris in the Hamptons three years ago.  Jill Biden hates Harris.  Who do you think is calling the shots?

uh leftists, or as you call them, communists literally hate biden. bernie and aoc supporters literally hate biden and are threatening to vote third party. biden is already quoted as saying nothing will fundamentally changed. he is ideologically closer to republicans than leftists
And passed the law that blacks are bad and need arrested back during the Clinton era, why do t you tell them that Biden has staked he didn‚Äôt want his children going to school with the apes? Why don‚Äôt you tell them why in major cities Planned parenthood is every couple block
His first day in office. Why don‚Äôt you explain why Bill Gates is pushing for the vaccine when he has murdered thousands in S Africa, mainly children with his vaccines. His has the mark of the Beast, to track anything and everything anyone does? Why don‚Äôt you tell them that Biden
When are you going to quit lieing to the people that back you. Go ahead and tell them that the 10% total income tax that Trump has been requesting over and over was declined by the Democrats. Tell them and show them that Biden (proven) keeps promising the take over the suburbs
Man you people are so BRAINWASHED. He pushed for income tax cuts and top to be 10%. Biden is pushing for tax increases. You really do need to get off of the lieing MSM. They are pushing New World Order. Read the book of Revelations in the Bible, it explains it all.

Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
Joe Biden is a fascist
Every single one of his speeches does nothing but tell us what Biden plans to do and how it won't work. He has NO platform for himself
It's good to read the article first:  "Biden led Trump overall, with support from 44 percent of voters compared to 40 percent who supported Trump" and that's because Biden is winning 21 percent of the group of roughly 6 million ‚Äúswing voters" who voted for Trump in 2016.
Maybe. I still think this narrative really helps Harris. If it pushes him to pick her, great for her. If she doesn't get picked, she can say it's because she was too ambitous for the Biden team, and that's not horrible for her...especially if she's eyeing 2024.
You trippin   This is about to be glorious üòÇ  Can't wait until KHive meltdown or Biden ally meltdown
Oh for sure. Just waiting to see how Biden is going to play this.
I remember eons ago thinking picking Biden was a good but small play.  I actually thought he just needed someone who was able to go on the attack because that was not really his thing.   Seems like a million years ago.
So transparent   Actually shocked Biden people care tbh
I understood why Obama felt the need to pick Biden as his VIP after Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúwell-spoken‚Äù comments in 08. He would have been perceived, within the party, as not playing nice. Because Black people ALWAYS have to forgive repentant white folks

Plot twist: they (the dnc) don't really give a fuck about beating Trump cus they all getting PAID because of his policies. A second term would mean more money.   The ONLY reason why Biden is looking great in polls is because Trump is so damn shitty.

The headline means it's Trump 60 Biden 20 (3-to-1) but they're not "Obama voters" they're "Obama voters who voted for Trump in 16" which means anything less than 100% shows he's losing voters. And 20% are still undecided. Terrible headline.

Fox News will assuredly make a bogeyman out of anyone Biden chooses.
Pay attention: August 1 announcement with a Biden quote.  Today is July 28.
Hey moron, Joe admitted he cannot do two things at once! #GruberLibs
Biden is an idiot. Btw, that's not what happened. The Media has been lying about it, because they don't want to admit a Church was burned down, mere yards from the White House. Joe can't do two things at once.
More proof, Joe can't do two things at once. #GruberFools
Real Fact: Trump said he would enact Defense Production Act but didn‚Äôt until AFTER Biden pressed him multiple times. Trump says a lot of things that don‚Äôt actually happen until after he is forced to act.
I‚Äôll fix it: Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign will pick Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate next week.
He doesn't even know he's Joe Biden, and running for POTUS, not Senate.  #GruberLibs
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where the Marlins play.
Biden taking questions from a list of people already pre picked (softballs)
Live: Biden discusses 'Build Back Better' economic recovery plan  via    First he says John couldn‚Äôt talk but wanted to and in same breath says he says john said ??? Which is it Biden
As she said, she wants Trump to lose. She doesn't want Biden to win. She just wants Trump to lose. She doesn't care for Biden. If Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or Paul Ryan was running against Trump she'd vote for them. But only because she despises Trump.
Trump is definitely NOT the answer, he is the disease and Biden is the cure.
Love that baby!  He‚Äôs a BIDEN fan!
I am so happy for Tuesday‚Äôs primary here in the Midwest where I will go mark my paper ballot for BIDEN!  My brother-in- law is having trouble getting registered in Arkansas so I only have to cancel out my sisters vote!
You mean Biden, right
Joe Biden knows he can't win and the media and DEMS know it too.  They are so desperate
Read the tweet. Stop blindly firing. He‚Äôs taking Trump‚Äôs side and bashing Biden once again.
So you like Trump more than Biden just like your daddy?
Oh my flipping Lord.  First not a Moderate second I doubt Joe can even color a coloring book.
Their spelling out all the corruption there in Ukraine with Joe Biden to come to their court system for testimony and everybody‚Äôs just ignoring the fact that Ukraine is really pretty irritated that they‚Äôve been set up by the Bidens.
Before your eyes. Additionally, he is trying to stay within constitutional responses because he can‚Äôt complain that they are being and doing illegal, if he just follows their same tactics. Which they try to do. WAtch OAN They are giving an entire series on Joe Biden and Ukraine
Presented by the Biden campaign
Well, it's not up to him to decide if he's leaving. If Biden is declared the Presidential winner, Trump will leave on Jan 20, 2021 or he will be escorted out of the People's House.
If you are to believe Trump, the world will burn if Biden is elected. Problem is we all know what 4 years of Biden looks like, which was peaceful and awesome.
Without a doubt!  A vote for Biden is a vote for Antifa/BLM.
BIDEN losers wake up
You forgot the ‚Äúit will all been gone after thr election if Biden wins‚Äù being spouted by the trumpettes. I asked if the Biden win would eradicate the virus from all other countries and the answer I got was....
We are trying. Electing Joe Biden on November 3rd will move us in the right direction.
#TRUMP2020 RELAX BIDEN CANT BEAT YOU. YOU HAVE NO COMPETITION AGAIST YOU.
Tell me again why I have to vote for Biden? #EarnMyVoteJoe
So I assume Joe Biden supports  being on the Presidential debate stage, so she can fully participate in our country
It has to be Michelle. Biden is very weak and needs someone else to carry this through.
Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer are like the Dallas Cowboys, too many years of failure, yet are given ample opportunities, and always accomplish nothing. And are a ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN!
Still saying it ? Haven‚Äôt you had almost 4 years of making it great ? Biden‚Äôs slogan should be clean the toilet bowl ( one up drain the swamp ) #yourealoser
If Biden doesn‚Äôt pick Kamala or Warren his chances of winning the election take a severe hit.
I don't believe  can deliver California for Joe Biden.  If she's a lock,  are in trouble.

Chris Dodd should not be asked to quit the Biden campaign. He should be fired.
Let‚Äôs hear Biden name them
She‚Äôs the only reasonable option under the circumstances. Biden is so weak.
Staying away from press conferences seems to be a winning strategy. Look at Biden‚Äôs poll numbers. Trump is on TV and Twitter constantly making statements to the press. Look at Trump‚Äôs poll numbers. If you want Trumpy to win you‚Äôre going to have to gag him.
Thread.  I hope  realizes that this Chris Dodd isn't looking out for his best interests or OURS.  Biden needs a strong, smart woman as his VP. Not a yes woman.  Don't relegate the first female VP in the U.S. to a title only.  #WomenareWatching,  !
I cannot think of any job that Joe Biden could do.   Walmart would fire him if he was a greeter.  Maybe for sniffing the hair of the customers when they come in the door?

It‚Äôs all Biden‚Äôs fault, somehow!
Biden: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not Hispanic if you vote for...‚Äù #YouKnowTheThing
Biden is sitting quietly watching Trump self-destruct. And, unlike you and Trumpy, he‚Äôs not standing behind a podium at the White House lying to the American people.
One overwhelming reason to vote FOR Biden: he‚Äôs not Trump!
I think Biden struggles to find his car keys now days.
The Democrats chose Biden. Politicians don't have to be rock stars. I'll take a game manager over a gun slinger.
Counterpoint: Biden is absolutely not an idiot. To even entertain this thought shows you gave not been paying attention, and/or don't care how the consequences of elections affect others because you'll be fine either way.
Against fracking?  That gives my vote to Biden.
Biden is in the basement bunker, you got it wrong. Trump has been out every day this past week, but nice try.
Still 300 miles remain and Joe Biden is still suck in the basement.
Unfortunately that woman will be a vote for Biden... they roam around sticking their nos is everybody‚Äôs else‚Äôs business! üí™
As a suburbanite, Trump‚Äôs actions offend me. I don‚Äôt see this as a tactic that will do anything but send suburbanites running to the polls to vote for Biden. We don‚Äôt like authoritarianism.
You know they already blaming this on Obama and Biden.
Anyone but Michelle Obama brings more liabilities than assets to the ticket. All the other choices will immediately begin major erosion of Biden‚Äôs support without adding much enthusiasm.
I love the way some Biden supporters, dems, libs etc.. automatically resort to name calling, and violent rants...When you ask them to take responsibility...Is that all they have? Its scary...

Copy and paste this text and tweet it:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.                       Please pass this on.
There has been thewhole idea that Russia/Putin is controlling him, and that there is some blackmail out there. The Maxwell comments definitely didn't help. My understanding is that Biden will raise interest rates back up to help fight inflation. 280 char isn't enough right now
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Hey  Joe Biden doesn‚Äôt have a history like you do and it‚Äôs not good trust me believe me Bigly.  Yours is bad.   Maxwell well wishes won‚Äôt save you.  Also Joe hasn‚Äôt been the president,  YET. You have and you failed

There are absolutely no presidential signs in yards in richville KC Kansas. Biden or Trump. No BLM signs. Only signs I see are local races, mostly Democratic.

They want to control the voting (force mail-in) to affect the (illegal) election of ‚ÄúHidin‚Äô Biden!
I am on your side man. Totally. False positives constantly, deaths being inflated daily for people who didn‚Äôt even die from a Covid. Anything to keep the hysteria going. This virus will magically be under control Nov 4th if Biden wins.
If American voters didn‚Äôt learn in 2016 to not believe polls, than we didn‚Äôt learn anything. I don‚Äôt care if Biden is up by 50 points in Nov.  I‚Äôm still voting because we know Trump will cheat if he can.
If you truly think Biden is better for this country I really feel sorry for you.  Stop watching and reading Liberal news outlets and look at the facts of what Trump has done for this country since 2016!
Only Biden would swing at that
Who should be Biden's invited guests to his first State of the Union? I'll get you started: 1) Reality Winner 2) Christopher David (Navy Vet)
Trump WILL win if we are complacent or sit home and pout cause our favorite candidate didn‚Äôt get the nomination or write in names besides Biden.
The Fallout Over Biden Calling Trump a Racist: Why Now?
Hannity didn't want to talk about Joe's nose, Mr Biden him self said that when he would be in the hospital, nurses would blow in his nose to get him moving. Poor old Joe has made some pretty dumb statements over the years, but that has to be one of the top dumbest.
As opposed to being a Bernie, Hillary or Biden supporter. 100% ok by me üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I do agree the person who is in that is sick.  Just not Biden.
It really was selfless of 630,000 or so people worldwide to give their lives for Joe Biden's July polling numbers.
Meanwhile....back in the sane world the Biden campaign has been planning a virtual convention for the last 4 months. Should be an interesting contrast.
Trump War Room keeps showing carefully edited video clips of Joe Biden falsely portraying him as having diminished mental capacity.  Nobody believes they are true. Everyone can see Trump on live TV daily displaying his diminished mental capacity, stupidity and corruption.

Im not paying any attention to polls. I don't care if Biden cures cancer in the meantime and Trump goes running naked across The Mall barking like a dog. I'll wait until Election Day, and hold my breath.
Donald Trump has failed for 72 years. Don‚Äôt give him another chance to fail again. It‚Äôs time for the Trump campaign to talk more about what Trump can do and less about what Biden can‚Äôt do. Just think of the advertising dollars you‚Äôll save. Nothing to talk about.
Interesting.  I don‚Äôt think this is the stance you take if your goal is to be Biden‚Äôs VP.  This looks more like a long term play to move yourself in position to pick up the Bernie Bros.

This is Biden's people acting like nutjobs. In case you were wondering.
Where is he then? Biden can't even take criticism from factory workers in an interview without losing his cool
I know right ? So fucking dumb how they project the now on to Biden ? It‚Äôs a loserI'm so confused as to why her being ambitious is bad. Biden is 77 years old, one term is all he needs and then hand it off to a competent AMBITIOUS Vice President.
Can you elaborate... I listed joe Biden evil and you completely ignored it.
A child pedo? A person who jailed all types of minorities? ( 1993 ) crime bill. What did trump do that was so evil? When people say lesser than two evils, they Have to realize joe Biden have been a politican for over 40 years with no change.
Bill Clinton! Hilary Clinton Obama and joe Biden!! Let the sheep know!
People that support biden don‚Äôt watch his debates. I know for a fact.
joe biden is FAR from the ideal candidate. i am aware of that and agree with that. but ANYONE is better than trump. there are so many more problems with trump than there are with biden. open your eyes

And DEMs won't be able to help themselves. They will stuff TONS of pet projects into the "stimulus" bill. But they'll get it passed and Biden will sign it. The vote will be purely on party lines. Maybe a few nervous DEMs will defect. 5/
Let's play out what happens if the DEMs dump the filibuster.  The scenario is this. Biden wins (I think likely). And DEMs win a small majority in the Senate (definitely possible).   DEMs still can't pass "meaningful" legislation. Their agenda is largely shutdown. 1/

That there's little meaningful difference between Trump blowing by the exit at 90 mph whereas Biden is going to miss it while doing 55 in the left lane doesn't seem to register with these people.
Biden can't get distracted by the 100s of other things that Trump has done wrong. He needs to focus on the U.S.'s relative failure to handle COVID-19 when compared to every other nation. Discussing issues like troops in Germany, the suburbs, or Portland plays into Trump's hands.

Ryan Dietsch speaks passionately on gun violence, talks not from a policy standpoint, but "from the way that it affects people every day."   Malcolm Graham (NC - Biden) on gun violence: sister killed in Charleston shooting, supports universal background checks, closing loopholes.
Walker: 2/3 of voters back marijuana legalization. Can increase electoral margins by supporting this proposal and excite the base in the process.  Bakari Sellers (SC - Biden) also speaks in support of legalization of marijuana.  Cleo Fields opposes it.
Obduskey notes that in CO legalized marijuana funds education, mental health, and a quarter million jobs.   Stacey Walker (Biden) echoes incarceration/overpolicing statistics and says as a Black man he supports the proposal. Says legalizing would add $131.8 billion to fed.
Alejandro Garcia (Biden, Puerto Rico) opposes this, saying the party platform isn't the place to discuss these provisions.   Votes: 19 Yes 135 No 9 Abstain
Travis Mooney, 2016 and 2020 Bernie supporter who now supports Biden, proposes removing requirement that expats who have no taxes to pay must still file (which is costly). Ends the threat of double taxation for those who already pay taxes in their country of residence.
Alex Padilla (Biden) proposes support for USPS re: mail-in ballots, mandatory and statistically meaningful post-election audits, full transparency of all election results and data, voters must be informed of opportunity to fix any problem with their ballot, secure &amp;timely counts.
The fact that committee members overwhelmingly opposed all iterations of M4A and Medicare expansion, yet unanimously approved expanding CHCs when it was introduced by a Biden supporter, suggests that Dem policies are all a sham and they vote based solely on party loyalty.

Honest question for all people who are voting Biden  What line does Biden have to cross to lose your vote? What issue? What tragedy would he have to be a part of that he already isn't?  I ask this in seriousness, because Biden crossed that line a long time ago imo
Keep dreaming. Biden will never make President of this country. It‚Äôs good you have a dream though.
Do you referring to Biden‚Äôs cervix Agenda?
Black people that weren‚Äôt voting anyway are always looking for a reason to validate it. They were already mad at Biden for the 90s. Kamala would be the icing on the cake. Susan Rice would be attacked for Benghazi. It‚Äôs a Catch 22.
I do not know how many clones joe used while he was a senator? Or if he even used one bat all?   joe &amp; hunter biden, are on on this list üëâ
Would work for me!
Lol you really think Google wants Biden as president?
Hey, Biden said it and he's doin pretty good.
And people wonder why I refuse to vote Biden   Guess "I ain't black"
Three people charged in Twitter hack that hit Biden and Obama #SmartNews
They will hammer Biden and the VP pick. I suspect a turn to "immigrants" again at some point. Also, he will try to make amends to his sliding evangelical base, perhaps antiabortion or LGBTQ+ policy.ü§î
If Trump wins will Biden concede? Probably Not! A National mail in ballot is risky, for those concerned with Covid request an absentee ballot, states can also open for early voting my State does this.
Dude, your profile is all ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù garbage. You‚Äôre not fooling anyone that you are a reasonable person. It‚Äôs ridiculous to pretend that Biden isn‚Äôt better than Trump. You‚Äôre not convincing any rational people with this nonsense.

The demoncrat cult tools voting for Joe 'babble' Biden don't care. Zombies. SMH.
OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  RACIST, VOTED WITH THE KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS AGAINST MINORITIES.  ABOUT 80 YRS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES.  POLLS INCLUDE DEMOCRAT SHOWS, DEMENTIA.
Or we could just scream at the ~27,000,000 unemployed Americans ‚Äúget a job you lazy bums!!‚Äù within a job market with ~5,000,000 available positions (most of which they don‚Äôt qualify for). Then we could sleep easy at night knowing the problem is laziness, not the GOP. /s
For the same reason polls show Biden besting Trump. It‚Äôs all BS.
BIDEN IS ABOUT 80 YRS OLD WITH ABOUT 50 YRS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, NO ACCOMPLISHMENTS &amp; RACIST.  VOTED WITH KKK AGAINST MINORITIES.  IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID IN VERMONT, DIDN'T HAVE ON MASK.  OBAMA'S PHYSICIAN SAID BIDEN IS NOT HEALTHY.  BRAIN SURGERIES, DEMENTIA.
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP FOUND TRUMP HAS DONE MORE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAN ANY PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM.  NORC- CENTER POLL FINDS THAT BIDEN'S SUPPORTERS ARE LESS ENTHUSIASM THAN PRESIDENT TRUMP.  BIDEN WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE SAID HE WAS IN VERMONT, NO MASK ON.
One of the top priorities of the Biden administration should be to expand the Supreme Court.
Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, subpoenaed the State Department Friday demanding copies of documents that  has already provided to   investigating
It will. They always do. Particularly post Labor Day. Everyone beating off over Biden in July is silly.
Joe Biden or Donald Trump is going to win the election, no one else. It‚Äôs a two-party system and as much as I hate it, there isn‚Äôt anything I can do about it. So in the most important election in recent history, I‚Äôm not wasting my vote on someone who stands no shot at winning.
"Gaffe  wait, don't do it to us, don't choose a #FarLeft candidate to run with you "Gaffe Joe"...the harmful policies like of the "Squad" MUST be rejected especially by you...pick someone moderate...don't sell us out!

Yep. Not taking hot takes from any white man about Biden's VP pick. Screw that.
Is he wrong? Have you not seen the idiots protesting and burning shit and killing people? It may not be half but it‚Äôs probably not far from it. Hell, according to your hero Biden the US population is almost all dead from the Covid virus
Of all the heavily rumored Biden VP choices, Karen Bass would be the best
Thank you President Biden
Is anyone else wondering if the current administration will have to be forcibly removed from the WH? And will he skip out on Biden being sworn in? I mean, those things on his level of classlessness. And what will 11/4-1/20 look like? What a shit show this will be.
Probably the biggest nerd herd I have ever seen. Can you imagine being under 30 and supporting Biden in early February?
You can call it shorthand. It‚Äôs not shorthand. It‚Äôs a damn lie. If Biden or any democrat spoke this way you‚Äôd be calling them a liar. But it‚Äôs Trump so it‚Äôs shorthand.
Biden is not an elected official yet. He has zero responsibility to hold Trump accountable. Nowhere in the constitution does it say ‚Äúthe executive branch shall be held in check by the opposing party‚Äôs candidate‚Äù. That is a ridiculous position.
Put a big ass Biden sign in your yard and you‚Äôll realize there‚Äôs a lot of hope right now. People even say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù
Should be the pitch poster for Biden but also show potential cabinet position in a Biden administration.
I don't even need to know who Biden's running mate it. I'm sure she'll be fabulous.

Oh the Dems have an October surprise planned but it will either be another virus more deadly than the first, or it will be releasing the cops who killed Floyd on a technicality so there will be more rioting and less voting. Then they plan to claim Biden won &amp; fake news will help.
Democrats must realize that foreign policy is just as important as domestic. No way around it. Biden is the right guy for international issues. Domestic is very important. Just do not forget outside our borders.
Tweet, Retweet, any Biden or Democratic candidate. Follow back ad well.
I totally believe this!! I‚Äôve thought they feel every dem death is one less vote for Biden. This is extreme, but Trump has such a cold heart I do believe it‚Äôs possible.

A vote for an independent/libertarian/write-in this year will only help trump by taking votes away from Biden. Biden isn‚Äôt a great candidate or probably even a great person, but he at leasts acts like it and will listen to the people around him... pick your poison here...
Fair enough. Here's the results: Biden wins!
Except those that accuse Biden of sexual harassment.. you don‚Äôt support them..
Joe Biden must suspend diplomatic relations with Russia and China. Build up NATO. Georgia and Ukraine must become members. Trust me. Putin will back down. Just do it Joe.

Yes...for Biden
Tucker: Joe Biden's VP pick will be the most consequential in history
BLACK VOICES FOR TRUMP KNOWS BIDEN HAS BEEN RACIST ALL OF HIS CAREER.   VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS SO THEIR CHILDREN WOULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL WITH BLACKS.  WROTE CRIME BILL, RESULTED IN MASS INCARCERATION OF BLACKS.  THOUGHT OF BLACKS OF INFERIOR RACE.
Interesting on YouTube: Tucker: Joe Biden's VP pick will be the most consequential in history
Little Richard can‚Äôt wait to vote for Biden. Even though Little Richard is dead. He completed his mail-in ballot while sitting in the waiting room to hear what St. Peter had to say. Or maybe it was an illegal immigrant who filled out the mail-in ballot.Who really knows who voted?
No, but with Trump trailing Biden by double digits in the polls there aren't a lot of takers for the role.
Yes it is  Obama and Biden trashed it
Agreed. Your comment reminded me of this article from earlier this year on the eulogies Biden‚Äôs delivered.
Joe Biden finally crawls out of his basement. The Left tested hundreds of COVID vaccines on him to try to keep him alive until Election Day
Joe Biden tweeted this from a land line on an autogyro
the gag is, Dems enable Trump, whereas Republicans opposed Obama and still got what they wanted. its almost like.. Democrats don‚Äôt really CARE about all they posture for, because the end result still directly benefits them  this cult mentality around Obama is why Biden is the nom
I‚Äôm sorry, but I won‚Äôt believe _any_ of these people until I see their completed ballots and how much money they donate to Biden‚Äôs campaign. In other words, I will _never_ believe these people. Performative outrage is all this is.
Actually, it matters bc ppl mistakenly believe that Trump is an aberration, that he didn‚Äôt inherit much of his powers from prior presidents (including Obama). So just getting rid of Trump isn‚Äôt enough and thinking Biden will simply erase the Trump legacy is incredibly naive.
From Obama's mouth to God's ears!! Biden/Warren 2020
Postal worker union endorsed Biden and we should allow them to handle the election they can even ship packages for Amazon without getting fucked  If you can protest and riot in person you can vote in person
James, it‚Äôs simple brother. It‚Äôs common sense. Biden is in bed with china, they tried to take out Trump, it didn‚Äôt work, so China unleashed the virus. They figured the people they were paying here weren‚Äôt getting the job done, so they did it themselves
Mr. Secretary, you took Con Law at a more prestigious school than I did, but I aced l &amp; ll so apparently I got more out of it than you did. There's no "legal determination" to make. He doesn't have that power. He's just trying to plant seeds illegitimacy when Biden wins.
Practice what you preach Biden
Trump has taken a sledgehammer to democracy.  Ignoring everything in the constitution except the 2nd amendment; he would toss that one out the window too if more non white non Christian citizens were to exercise their rights.   To say Biden is a bigger threat is ludicrous.
just got called boring by a dude who‚Äôs most recent retweets were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lmao
Who‚Äôs the we going to win?its just him&amp;biden
Criticizing Biden is not the same as supporting Trump
biden is LITERALLY one year younger than Bernie and has had multiple brain aneurysms

I disagree. Haven‚Äôt we learned how much smoke he blows? The results will be convincing (Biden wins by at least 5 points) and Trump exits stage left.
No, they're not. You need to look up what a red herring actually is. And we're not helping Trump, Joe Biden and the Democrats are.
Only way that happens is if he leaves office early. Biden won‚Äôt grant it. He politically can‚Äôt. Already has a tenuous relationship with progressives.
FWIW: i'm NEVER voting for Biden. u can ask me bout it if u want. just trying to share info w/ each other &amp; discuss not judge or start shi*
Bernie definitely secures more than 5% in each of his runs and didn‚Äôt have to drop out in shame because of plagiarism and lies (Biden.) Thats to be expected from the guy that still lies today that his wife and son were killed by a drunk driver. his supporters seem to do the same.
seems like you were more effective than Biden‚Äôs 3 (?) previous presidential runs. keep it up Steve üëç
1. Neither of those things are red herrings, Joe Biden is pro-fracking. And we are still at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  2. Even if those two things weren't true, that's not even close to what a straw man argument is.
Trump is an a-hole joke, Biden is terrifying.
If you all don‚Äôt want to vote for joe biden then vote for Jo Jorgensen.
I always give Trump a pass when he slurs his words because he's working 24/7 and is tired from talking all day. Biden does max 25 minutes and gafs it Everytime

If  is Biden‚Äôs VP choice, I will be SO EXCITED TO VOTE FOR BIDEN. If she‚Äôs not, I‚Äôll still vote for Biden because, you know, he‚Äôs not Trump. I said what I said.
these assholes are going to try and run out the clock for a Biden doj
Who will you vote for Biden or Trump?
NOT HARDLY, THE RESULTS WILL BE ON ELECTION NIGHT. I predict a landslide that Biden will kick your ass in votes
Imagine actually thinking Joe Biden is going to win over Trump. I would honestly love to be that clueless.
If it weren't for FDR and Lincoln..but he's in that conversation. He's that amazing. And I wish every moment he could run again. I wonder if Biden can pick him as VP
So the last time we saw Biden, he said he was going to prosecute ‚Äúanarchists‚Äù, which is just code word for protestors. They tried this with ‚Äúcannabis smokers‚Äù in the 70s. Nixon literally said you can‚Äôt prosecute being left or black so they just went after pot smokers.
Great question:  Where Does Joe Biden Go to Get His Apology?  via
Just remember if Biden happens to win, we need to treat him with the same respect and optimism that the left has treated Trump with.  It‚Äôs only fair to match their class.
Wondering if Republicans still think it‚Äôs treasonous to propose delaying the election...
He's an idiot, a liar, and everyone knows it. The #GOP, many anyway, will soon begin to run from him. Vote them all out! #VoteOutEveryRepublican #Biden
Joe Biden hasn't changed in his thinking at all since 1975. Why is anyone using fearmongering as a reason to vote for him?
The US should be embarrassed by having a blabbering idiot leading it. Aside from being a liar, he can't construct a meaningful thought. Vote his as# out, and anyone that supports him. #VoteBlue #Biden
Trump wants to kill USPS so that all the private mailing companies he has stock in will skyrocket. He literally only cares about himself and y‚Äôall want to re-elect him because ‚ÄúBiDeN iS dUmB aNd oLd‚Äù

Fact check: Joe Biden didn't take a knee upon seeing a flag; he was talking to a child
I thought it was tacky, everybody has their opinion.  Obama Felt power behind the podium speaking the way he used to as president a political scheme for sick Joe Biden. When they debate in public Joe is going to look like an idiot.

Joe Biden is normal when he can find his way out of the basement?  He is lost and obviously you are too.
Biden calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035. Here‚Äôs how far we have to go.
True. Too bad they won't get it in Biden.
John Lewis said he remembered Hillary Clinton in the Civil Rights movement.  Hillary was a Goldwater girl during the movement, and the Clintons never did a thing for blacks.  Check out the 1994 Crime Act, written by Joe Biden for Bill Clinton.  It has decimated black families.
You see how much money I got on the catch?! I was thrilled. Biden is so jealous!
I think Joe Biden said it best.  Paraphrase: "We finally have a clean, sharp, articulate black man to run for president!"  Huh, now that I reread that, it sounds a bit racist!ü§îü§îü§îü§î
You sound as accurate as Biden
Your bizarre attack on Joe Biden in the primaries could have damaged our chances to beat Trump. Based on this, it seems you are not disciplined or dedicated enough to be the VP pick.  You seem more like a selfish opportunist than a future potus.

Biden is doing hella better in Texas than any other GOP candidate has in the last 40 years.
I like how Trump says that he is going to try to hold on to power anyway possible, and your reaction is "Well, this is Biden's fault for not stopping him"
we've joked it would be hilarious if he became Biden's chief of staff -it'll never happen, but man it would be delicious

Uh go back in every election ever they always talk trash on the other candidates üòÇüòÇ I can tell most Biden supporters are very young and   Have low IQ
I tend to agree. Leadership should come from the top down and Trump has not shown that. Unfortunately, Biden has been in politics a long time and hasn't been that man either, which takes me back to the wish (dare I say prayer) that another option will appear.
Because today is about John Lewis? Not Joe Biden,
I‚Äôm not actually sure anyone is on the Biden train lmao
A lot of us aren't considering Biden as settling but I get your point.
For Biden's allies, his closing argument to people of faith comes down to that: You can't reclaim the soul of a nation without first taking seriously the state of your own.
What a joke. We know you're a Trojan for Russia, now you want to project on Biden?  He's working with Americans, not a foreign country. He's far from radical left. You're just bluster.  Can't even organize a pandemic response when a 'pandemic for dummies' manual was there for you
So, Karen?  The Clintons are running this show.  They want Harris.  Jill Biden wants to be First Lady.

That Trump is a racist, white supremist, etc are widely-used democrat talking points that I don‚Äôt subscribe to. I wonder if Carol Folt subscribes!? Would she come out and endorse Joe Biden for President? She seems to have a political bent and maybe wants to unburden herself.

He wasn't voting for Biden so he wasn't black.  Their racism has been exposed for a while.  Now they will say "He sought safety in the mindless ideology of the right, and he paid the ultimate price for it."
Even after Harris did her solid and withheld her endorsement of Joe Biden until Warren dropped out. Harris respects the sisterhood even if Warren doesn't.
White electorate in SC grew 112% and went overwhelmingly for biden. Believe what you want about extremely obvious things
South Carolina was a majority white dem primary electorate for the first time in 50 years due to Republicans coming en masse to vote for biden. Personally I think it's great that we're listening to Republicans and pretending it's black voices being heard
This thread with all the people in the Trump Camp who claimed Biden was wrong and Trump would never.....
Clouded judgement all around for sure. The blind loyalty piece seems to be heavier on one side considering every dem will tell you Biden is a dumb fuck. With media maybe our perception is mostly what our friends share rather than actual outlets and friends share their bias
Once Biden is elected we need to teach Mr Putin a lesson he will not forget about meddling in other nations. We need to increase our NATO presence, engage in cyber warfare and put economic sanctions on Russia that will cripple Putin's hold on his enslaved people. Putin must go.
Calling it now:  will be  VP pick. She‚Äôs the only one who can truly energize their base. Big Mike would then become President after they toss Biden aside and invoke the 25th Amendment. And then this country is officially toast.
So  how are you feeling today? Still think Biden owes an apology?
Make summer a slow news cycle again.   Just floating winning messages for Team Biden.
I've been saying this for awhile, though Biden has specifically said on the record he won't. The precedent is Nixon.

Yes, but Walter‚Äôs eyes look more alive than Biden‚Äôs. Sad that the Dems are using that dementia-ridden man like this. Even sadder that supposedly intelligent people are seriously campaigning and planning to vote for the pathetic shell.
Obama Unleashes on Trump Privately as He Raises $24 Million for Biden  via
Not neccessarily, Biden can throw out outrageous statements that people will eat up.  You've forgotten 2012 and 2010.
Biden, another talking point to make.
Trump and Biden tied in Georgia: poll
UR sending kids to school, U can have an election, anything else is Dictatorship! Threatening an election proves (1) U can‚Äôt win this election on your own (just like the first). (2) U know Biden will win. (3) Putin is tired of UR crazy ass &amp; he‚Äôs out! (4)U were never gonna leave!
Biden called it.
And no I ain‚Äôt a fuckin Trump or Biden supporter, all these politicians Corrupt af
GDP 33% reduction Donald. On your watch. Worst quarter in American history. God want Joe Biden to win. Biden 2020.
This would be a fairly alienating pick, so there‚Äôs a 100 percent chance Biden does it.
As President Donald Trump's poll numbers continue to decline among people of faith, the Biden campaign is hoping that the authenticity of Biden's personal story, and, in particular, his Catholic faith will offer a stark moral contrast to Trump.
It was good until they showed Biden and I remembered that's the DNC's real plan.
Kamala Harris as Biden‚Äôs VP pick? Here are the Vegas odds
DEMOCRATS WANT TO KEEP BIDEN LOCKED AWAY IN HIS BASEMENT SO THE VOTERS CAN'T GET A GOOD LOOK AT BIDEN'S DECLINING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS.  OBAMA'S PHYSICIAN SAYS JOE BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.   RACIST, VOTED WITH KLU KLUX KLAN LEADERS AGAINST MINORITIES.
And no, of course that's not THE reason the market is doing well right now. Not that simple obviously. Just like saying if Biden wins, the market will crash. Same scare tactics used in every election.
So do you think Kamala Harris will get off her knees infront of Willie Brown and get selected for Biden‚Äôs VP pick?
OBAMA PERSONAL PHYSICIAN FOR A LONG TIME SAYS BIDEN IS NOT A HEALTHY GUY.  ABOUT 80 YEARS OLD, BRAIN SURGERIES.  POLLS EVEN DEMOCRAT SHOWS DEMENTIA.  CNBC POLL SUPPRESS THE ENTHUSIASM OF TRUMP'S VOTERS  CREATES HEADLINES.  UNDER SAMPLING OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
That‚Äôs a lie on both counts , Harris will drag Biden down with her CJ record She adds nothing to the ticket
This is just not accurate , she couldn‚Äôt run her own campaign well &amp; didn‚Äôt make one Primary   She will drag Biden , the only people that want her are people who blindly follow without Objectively reviewing her record
No Medicare4All no vote for Joe Biden!
Nice meme dude, that'll show Trump for sure! Biden totally has my vote now. Radical, man!  Hey, we can be Biden Bros now!
I am spending time during the pandemic promoting Joe Biden. Trump is the biggest threat to America. Go vote. Elect Biden.
a lot of the people complaining about joe biden being the democratic nominee didn‚Äôt bother voting during the primaries but y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt ready for that conversation yet
I‚Äôve seen several tweets like this. Some even suggesting Kamala orchestrated her own attack to trap Biden into picking her. ü§¨Truly cannot comprehend that Kamala doesn‚Äôt need to engineer anything. Her creds stand on their own merit and they cannot stand it.
Silver Alert! #SleepyJoeBiden's mind is missing! Can anyone find it by Nov 2020? Biden can't do interviews without pre scripted questions and the answers on the his teleprompter for #SleepyJoeBiden to try and read.  Vote #GOP
That pretty much sums Biden up.
Also, haven't seen a Biden sign ANYWHERE, anyone else?
Keisha Lance Bottoms is being floated as a possible VP pick for the Democrats. Imagine. Biden Bottoms 2020
I don't believe it. I feel like it's a ploy to bring Joe Biden poll numbers down. Don't fall for the okie-doke
Gotta be the actual campaign making them. Very disciplined with using all the right colors and fonts, grammar &amp; style is consistent, and seems like they have an encyclopedic library of non-public Biden images to choose from.
I disagree, i have a strong feeling (unfortunately) Trumps gonna get re-elected. Biden isn't a democratic favorite. People just aren't going to vote. But yes AOC is definitely a front runner. Definitely hope Biden wins tho.
There's no rule that says Michelle Obama couldn't be Biden's running mate, if she wanted the gig but Barack can't do it because he's already served 2 terms as POTUS.
The Clintons anointed Harris in the Hamptons three years ago.  Jill Biden hates Harris.  Who do you think is calling the shots?
And no matter who he choses, vote Biden!
a libertarian preferring Biden to Trump has completely lost the plot
this is all about frowning on campaigning as a whole so Biden can be justified to stay hidden.
1. Never said I wasn't voting, just not voting for Trump or Biden.  2. We have every right not to choose between 2 sexual predators and complain all we want about the people that do and the corrupt system they're helping to maintain
Feel the Bern can GFY and the rioters and looters seeking free masks can SMB.  If you need to know what SMB means, ask any Biden supporter.  They are very skilled at it.
Biden will be about as easy to push left as Trump. THAT'S THE POINT.
Biden and Obama's drone program had a 90% civilian kill rate. Sounds pretty war crime-y to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs time that we all need to come together, Democrats and Republicans alike, in a bi-partisan effort for America. If you support Donald Trump, please drive with your headlights ON during the day. If you support Joe Biden, please drive with your lights OFF at night.
Do you honestly believe that we will be able to push Biden to the left AFTER he gets our votes?

Joe Biden's Notes Suggest Kamala Harris May Be His VP Pick #SmartNews
Looking back and forth between a pic of Hillary and a pic of Biden:

I think the idea that Biden was ever going to pick Demmings, Bass, or Abrams is laughable
the ‚ÄúOK FINE, i will vote for joe biden‚Äù is killing me
uh leftists, or as you call them, communists literally hate biden. bernie and aoc supporters literally hate biden and are threatening to vote third party. biden is already quoted as saying nothing will fundamentally changed. he is ideologically closer to republicans than leftists
And passed the law that blacks are bad and need arrested back during the Clinton era, why do t you tell them that Biden has staked he didn‚Äôt want his children going to school with the apes? Why don‚Äôt you tell them why in major cities Planned parenthood is every couple block
His first day in office. Why don‚Äôt you explain why Bill Gates is pushing for the vaccine when he has murdered thousands in S Africa, mainly children with his vaccines. His has the mark of the Beast, to track anything and everything anyone does? Why don‚Äôt you tell them that Biden
When are you going to quit lieing to the people that back you. Go ahead and tell them that the 10% total income tax that Trump has been requesting over and over was declined by the Democrats. Tell them and show them that Biden (proven) keeps promising the take over the suburbs
Man you people are so BRAINWASHED. He pushed for income tax cuts and top to be 10%. Biden is pushing for tax increases. You really do need to get off of the lieing MSM. They are pushing New World Order. Read the book of Revelations in the Bible, it explains it all.
She actually DESERVES to be President, only less so than  . Biden campaign is in NO position to complain.
Sean Hannity ramps up warnings of Biden presidency in new book, Fox Nation special
If policies matter at all, and having popular policies that people agree with is a good thing, then yeah.  But Biden adopting good policies would be just as great.
Per  Rice has no known stance on:  Healthcare Police brutality The economy Marijuana Education Climate Guns Minimum wage...  Wants to be in office, but stands for nothing? Seems like she and Biden are a perfect match!
I thought it was like common knowledge that Biden wouldn‚Äôt last two terms? I‚Äôll be amazed if he can get through one
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
Joe Biden is a fascist
It's good to read the article first:  "Biden led Trump overall, with support from 44 percent of voters compared to 40 percent who supported Trump" and that's because Biden is winning 21 percent of the group of roughly 6 million ‚Äúswing voters" who voted for Trump in 2016.
Maybe. I still think this narrative really helps Harris. If it pushes him to pick her, great for her. If she doesn't get picked, she can say it's because she was too ambitous for the Biden team, and that's not horrible for her...especially if she's eyeing 2024.
You trippin   This is about to be glorious üòÇ  Can't wait until KHive meltdown or Biden ally meltdown
Oh for sure. Just waiting to see how Biden is going to play this.
I remember eons ago thinking picking Biden was a good but small play.  I actually thought he just needed someone who was able to go on the attack because that was not really his thing.   Seems like a million years ago.
So transparent   Actually shocked Biden people care tbh
I understood why Obama felt the need to pick Biden as his VIP after Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúwell-spoken‚Äù comments in 08. He would have been perceived, within the party, as not playing nice. Because Black people ALWAYS have to forgive repentant white folks

Biden is going to elect Kamala as his running mate isn‚Äôt he?
This is nonsense. She‚Äôs qualified, she ran for President, in an earlier interview with  he asked Biden if he‚Äôd prefer to pick a vp from those who had run a presidential campaign as Obama did with him, and Biden answered yes.
I also heard it may have been plagiarized from Hillary, which would be very consistent for Biden üòÇ

Plot twist: they (the dnc) don't really give a fuck about beating Trump cus they all getting PAID because of his policies. A second term would mean more money.   The ONLY reason why Biden is looking great in polls is because Trump is so damn shitty.
Also ....Joe Biden is a super corporate Democrat. He is the superman of corporate democrats.....   That's why the DNC made sure to make him the democratic nominee.
Rumor that Biden is gonna announce his running mate next week.   That should be a fun Twitter day.

But Joe says if we let him be president he promises to do all the things he promised to do while in Congress but didn‚Äôt do.  Maybe he really means it this time?  Anyone who votes for Biden is a moron like this person. Too dumb to know a joke.

i want to be clear: any VP Biden picks will be a black woman, &amp; they will use her as damage control to round up the black base and whitewash Biden‚Äôs record, even if they r a progressive (lol)  the democratic party have mastered tokens &amp; identity politics, but its coming 2 a head
Jim wants to make sure Google doesn't do anything to help Joe Biden.  I hope he'll apply that same logic to the companies that his  own campaign and the Trump campaign pay to help market and promote their campaigns.
if Biden picks Kamala, they will put her on a world tour, literally doing every single interview in place of biden and painting her as the face of the ticket.  and it will fail miserably. kamala brings no voters that biden doesn‚Äôt already attract. we know her record  dems r fools

Sometime soon, Joe Biden will choose his Vice Presidential running mate. His shortlist contains very impressive and exciting talent that‚Äîregardless of his pick‚Äîwill play a key role in the future of his administration, the Democratic Party, and the country.
Agreed. He shouldn‚Äôt be re-elected. And Biden should not be elected.  He is a puppet and weak.  is the only viable option and if weak minded people who are unwilling to break away from the two party system just voted for her, she would win.
And you talked about Americans using disinfectants to possibly cure the COVID19 at a nationally televised coronavirus briefing! You have ZERO room to talk about Biden.

There will be a letter. It won't be like the one any left before. It will be the best letter ever. Biden should publish it when he releases Trump's taxes.Biden is a GOOD GUY
Joe Biden would likely become president with no election...
I don't think she's being seriously considered. VP Biden needs someone younger to take over leadership of the Party and he knows it. Plus he said himself he's looking at people who've already gone through vetting on the national stage.
House Democrats subpoena Pompeo for documents on Biden‚Äôs son
It doesn't appear that Biden has been in "game shape" for quite a while.  As someone who lost a father to dementia, I'm appalled that his family let's this go on.  Guess they are more interested in self-protection than their father's health and welfare.
Biden in a landslide. Start packing.

Let me be clear...  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris despise me, despise my future, and plan on doing nothing to help us take this country back from the oligarchy.  Anyone openly broadcasting plans to withhold their votes need to be congratulated for fighting for the people.
VP Biden is desperately needed to fix the country from you! Children are the most important things in our lives &amp; you want parents to surrender their kids at school daily because YOU have said Children are immune from Coronavirus. THIS IS A LIE!

It's all politics. Dems don't really care about him. It's their stage to rally since Biden can't attract an audience.
Wrong. It's a Biden Campaign rally.
And you can't state a single reason of why Biden over Trump. Other than your biased opinions. Nothing about policy. His (lackluster) history in politics. Just your TDS.  Like 99% of Democrats.  Congrats?

We're in a global pandemic. Key word: global.  You honestly think Joe would've done better? Called Trump every name in the book for his travel ban.  Biden's former COS said they got lucky with H1N1.  Trump can't control states. Especially when they resist him at every turn.
I think Biden actually forgot to pick his VP. NO WORRIES, they will tell him who it is through his earpiece very soon.
Oh my!  #Biden in ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù with Iranian operatives? Iran hates America. Is Biden working with this Anti-American foreign power to get them to influence the election?  #Treason #TraitorsJustice
Last i checked, Biden wasnt spending time on Epstein Island, wishing child sex traffickers well, or talking on tape that you can do anything to women if you're a star, like grab them by the pussy, and they'll let you. But keep on ignoring the President of the United States.
I'm a firm believer that Biden forgot to pick his VP. No worries though, someone will tell him who it is through his earpiece soon.

Joe Biden going after anarchists is absolutely batshit.
My reaction too! Trump wiped Clinton here, now Biden is up by +3. Bad signs for Trump.
I dont disagree, but can't we all agree we at least get a chance 2 make chg w/a Dem president? Nothing gained if Trump is re-elected..In fact, we will have an even bigger hole 2 dig out of. There's no viable ind candidate. U don't vote Biden, ur saying ur OK w/burning it all down
You're right, this is an excellent ad in favor of Biden. Literally no reason to be against progress.

Please be kind to survivors in terms of voting for Biden this November.   We don't need to be shamed and guilted into a decision that is already causing stress. Let us process and come to terms with what feels best.
This is a cool trendy thing to say every 4 years, but man...if you seriously don't think Biden will steer us down a totally different path you're not paying attention. This election matters.
The words Trump and Respect don‚Äôt EVER belong in the same sentence   ‚Å¶ cares about ONE thing   #NotMyPresident #FakePresident #HookerInTheWhiteHouse #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #WorstPresidentEver #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #Resist
he definitely doesn‚Äôt if he wins tx. cause there‚Äôs 0% chance biden loses each rust belt state.
trump now needs to spend in texas which has got to be debilitating cause if biden wins texas it‚Äôs all over.
Joe Biden just doesn‚Äôt seem like Catholic...
This coming from the racist P.O.S  who called  whitesupremacist very fine people! Also you've already FKD America up so bad that with  things couldn't get any worse than they already are &amp; in your words with Biden what do you have to lose?
You have satan if your voting for Biden
Your out of your mind! It will get worse if Biden gets in. God save us.
Nobody in there right mind would vote for Biden.
If you were at all inclined to vote Dem, it would be hard to get excited until you knew who was really going to be serving after Biden resigns due to dementia.  His family should be ashamed for this elder abuse.

I'm speechless üò≤  #SmartNews
You don't have to vote at all.  The Democrats have already placed over 50,000 phoney ballots in the hands of county election departments to take care of that for you.  100,000 more phoney ballots on the way.  What will happen when Biden dies before the election?
NO WAY! Anyone with an ounce of brains will vote Biden.
Haha. That or Basement Biden
...its still primary season, dear.  Also, the last time Delaware vote for a Republican was in 1988.   Also, its Biden's home state.  Also, there aren't any Trump signs (see the first point).   Ugh.
Funny, considering Joe Biden was part of the Administration that took Osama Bin Laden down. üßê
America has 330 million people, and the best we could come up with are Donald Trump and Joe Biden? Seriously?
Well if you haven‚Äôt noticed sweetheart we don‚Äôt have to bring out Joe Biden we just have to let Donald Trump talk and we can win on that
Lmfao Biden really called the smart girl to ask for her help on the hw üòÇ
Did Joe Biden borrow The Minnow?
I bet my husband. It's been on the fridge for months. First it was Biden, and when she dropped out I added her to the bet as VP.
I agree. If they don't go STRICTLY by the book, it'll be all for nothing. The silence from the players is deafening: Hillary, Clapper, Brennen,Comey,Strozk,Page,Obama,Biden,Rice,McCabe,et. al.
We really gotta vote for Biden
100% agree. even STILL after bernie won each of the first three states, we knew the media was counting south carolina to act like biden was just unbeatable.  but i still think that if warren was out on super tuesday it would have been a different election.
we are in the heels of a monumental tax cut for the wealthy, and now need to spend to keep working americans afloat... it‚Äôs no mystery as to why trump is trying to scale it back. #Biden #Election2020 #CNN
Biden is not a "radical".  Trying to lump that label on him seems very desperate.    He wants to give more money to the police, doesn't believe in M4A, and isn't for the green new deal.
Hey, maybe write another article about someone who lived in the same city as Biden who broke the law. Smear by association. We see you. 2/2
60% of America's Jews are voting for Biden.
If its not Elizabeth Warren I'd be very disappointed. If Biden is going to go ahead and take some of Elizabeth's polices and use her as an adviser for his campaign, then go the extra mile and make her VP so she can get the job done. If he just takes credit for her work that's low
39% of Texans who answered a Quinnipiac  University poll say Trump is the better choice over Biden for Addressing Racial Inequality. I'm hoping only 20 old white guys did that poll.
I haven't not seen a single Biden yard Sign, ANYWHERE... Strange
Coming this week: Should, could, likely, soon, be ready, be prepared. Antifa/BLM riots, masks, COVID, Biden, declass? MSM lies, Jack screws with accounts, cryptic posts, BOOM!!! Regurgitate and repeat.  C'MON PEOPLE, focus on the kids!!!üî•üî•üî• #SaveTheChildren
So you‚Äôre voting for Biden because he‚Äôs leading in the polls? #voteconscious #votewithintegrity
I don‚Äôt Care Brit. All the country cares about is ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù or that his ‚ÄúFederal thugs‚Äù are taking over our cities. What a joke. But the far left can‚Äôt let that information get out or Biden may lose. It‚Äôs a huge cover-up!
Ye gave the game away - write him in so he can take votes from VP Biden. Wonder who's paying him (or if he's the one having to pay for his multi-million dollar debt being erased).
Amen to that. So long president trump. Hello President Biden.
Do Republicans know that the scenes of chaos in the streets that they use trying to make people scared of Biden are really happening right now while they are in charge??? I just can't  believe these guys think Americans are that stupid.
Don‚Äôt forget the 19 enthusiastic supporters who watched Biden‚Äôs last live video event.
If you can‚Äôt get Biden out of his spider hole, how about having Candace Owens on with AOC? After all, if Biden wins he‚Äôll be the puppet to AOC‚Äôs puppeteer.
Yeah, that‚Äôs true. It doesn‚Äôt exist. Trump didn‚Äôt win in 2016, Hillary lost. I don‚Äôt think people dislike the DNC candidate nearly as much this time and I have faith Biden won‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù but Trump will lose because of just how unpopular he is amongst almost everyone in every party.
Great idea  . Since Wallace can‚Äôt get Biden out of his spider hole how about Owens and AOC? Makes sense since AOC will be the puppeteer to Biden‚Äôs puppet presidency if Biden wins. Would be Must See TV.
Just like trumpers have been saying for 4 years that is elections have consequences so when trump loses he may have to be tear gassed to leave the white House but we will get it ready for Joe Biden to move in. #OneTermTrump
You are corrupt and Biden will beat you in November. Bye.
Iam voting for Biden cause I must but,  I am NOT a Biden Republican I am an Independent until all current Enablers are voted out and a new Republican Party is rebuilt!
Okay, that‚Äôs a way to look at it.. But, watching and listening to a different opinion/views might get to an answer.. it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre justifying their view by listening..? Biden streamed the other day with only 19 people watching, you think 20 would make or break the show? üòÇ
Twitter and Facebook become targets in Trump and Biden ads
Even Biden isn‚Äôt that stupid to pick Killary
So he's endorsing Biden now?
And Trump told people to drink Clorox to kill covid‚Äî which is worse?  Vote.  Joe.  Biden.  In.  2020.
Just saw another Trump ad showing real chaos in the streets really happening now during the Trump Republican administration and the narrator says this might happen in the future with Biden. I can't  believe 1/3 of Americans still buy this
aside all the other terrible things biden has done to this country
biden is not better than trump
biden will lose because he cant form a sentence. nothing to do with you but I am hoping to see him torn apart in the debates
PSA:  JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Ignore his unfortunate grammar. Notice how he's pushing for a write in campaign to take votes from just one person - VP Biden. Wonder if those who bailed him out of multimillion dollar debt are calling in their chips.
Biden to cap pay for public school teachers at $15/hr.  as part of equal pay plan.  Income tax rate set at 27%.  Healthcare plan has $5000 deductible and $100 copay.

Joe Biden couldn‚Äôt pass a drivers test.
Joe is creepy Biden!
I am with you brother so keep it up.  Joe creepy Joe Biden should be put into his place!
Why do you people not just let Biden pick his own VP ?
Please get medical intervention.  Biden has already won the Democratic nomination.  In the general election there is zero chance you'll get within 45% points of Biden whether you are on the ballot or not.  Many states don't even allow write-ins.  Are you even aware of the laws?
It's not the job of the federal government to fund local police forces.  It's a non-issue.  Neither Trump or Biden should ever consider using federal tax dollars to fund local police that enforce state, county, and city laws.
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.
Who are you actually voting for, doesn‚Äôt appear that Biden is well?

why would individuals need to donate, biden‚Äôs campaign has super pacs and is funded by people far wealthier than bernie‚Äôs base.
another example of the moderate left picking up progressive policy when it‚Äôs politically expedient.  like cool, i‚Äôm glad you support it now but we‚Äôre going to hold you accountable if you balk two years down the line.  #Bernie #Fightfor15 #MinimumWage #Biden
bernie should not have laid down to the bullshit and endorsed biden. zero respect for this man
fascism is definied as far-right authoritarian ultranationalism rooted in oppression of a race or group.  that clearly is not joe biden.
No such thing according to Joe Biden.
What and the actual fuck is Biden going to do for us besides give false hope trump ben making powermoves
#FascistAmerica  Christian Activist Announces ‚ÄúHarass Biden Campaign‚Äù

In any other election I would respect their vote. However, in this election where we are fighting for our countries freedom from tyranny, any vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump.
oh come on, let‚Äôs not pretend biden is as equally bad as trump. you know that‚Äôs a ridiculous statement.  yes, biden‚Äôs record on crime and war suck ass, but we‚Äôre not talking about the trump level racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia.
I see a whole lot of Biden voters. Great job  Keep up the great work.
How much did Trump overperform Ohio polls in 2016? Is that a large enough lead for Biden?
fuck joe biden
100%. There's no chance a 3rd party candidate will win so it just steals votes from Biden.
Just donated to Biden. Pls do the same
He's too busy touching little kids with Biden to notice
The Greens offer what progressives want.  My vote would be wasted on Biden so he won't be getting it.
Joe Biden and Barack Obama fucked everybody, but they fucked black community the hardest. And they put up with it. Why? Because they thought Obama was one of them! #NoBiden #MAGA #Trump2020 #WW3
as ridiculous as that tweet is, i think it‚Äôs important to settle for biden, because as annoying as he is, we know he‚Äôs not a fascist.
Son. You‚Äôre the oldest. I want you to have this jar of sauerkraut. It‚Äôs been with us for 30 years now. It survived the move of 2008. Heck, its reassuring presence in the fridge helped us get through the Trump years. Then we used some of it to celebrate Biden‚Äôs win in 2020.
We need a president who sniff's women and doesn't see a problem with it. üòÇ yeah Joe Biden your to Fu**ing crazy for people
The democratic party has been hijacked by the Biden/Sanders far left socialist-Marxist regime incl ANTIFA. I don‚Äôt even know if the real Democrats know what‚Äôs going on. They just say ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù. WTF they better wake up!
One things for damned sure, if Biden wins by 12:01 p.m. Jan 20,2020 every shred of evidence will be bleach-bit or burned. Barr, are you willing to roll that dice?  Better to bring it out asap.
Enjoyed this. President Trump never dodges a question and Biden never takes questions and is rarely interviewed, certainly not by anyone who would challenge him. Good job, Dave. Don‚Äôt agree with your politics but enjoyed your respectful interview.
Fox news viewers are genuinely afraid  a Democratic president will be a regime that will physically harm them. There‚Äôs no way they will accept Biden unless and until Fox News pedals back. Don‚Äôt like it but there it is‚ÄîBiden‚Äôs going to have to deal w ü¶ä to deprogram the dittoheads
Even the best intentions have consequences. If Biden wins before Barr &amp; Durham act every bit of evidence will be bleached or burned  at 12:01 p.m. on Jan 20, 2021.
Here is your future if biden gets in and or dems control house and senate.
It sure did and they have it down to a science.  We need someone on our team who is excellent at cheating.  Just don‚Äôt have it in us.  But I do this election.  If Biden wins I‚Äôm freaking scared!

Fox is Doomed.  Didn‚Äôt they make huge donation to Biden?
6/ come January and if we have President Biden and the economy is still in bad shape, Republicans will claim they have rekindled their long lost love for austerity and will oppose any stimulus because a good economy will be bad for them.
Joe Biden doesn't have the brain power to agree or disagree.  He can barely feed himself.
Exactly my thoughts too.   It actually makes me think ‚Äúwhat are they really planning here, because they absolutely KNOW that Biden cannot win?‚Äù  I know he‚Äôll be an easy puppet for them, but he cannot get there in the 1st place.
Of course he endorses  Biden.  It's in the plan.
Invite  on the show, do a deep dive on the Portland fiasco, challenge his Unity 2020 idea and reservations for voting Biden. The conversation needs to happen

People voting for Biden have TDS which is much more dangerous than the china virus.  I think everyone who has it, should be quarantined until they are no longer infected or we have found a vaccine.  Below is the test that can be used, it is free with quick results.
Be honest, there are lots of women out there that would have no problem being grabbed by the pu$$y by a man with lots of money so knock off the fake outrage.  Now Biden prefers touching the breast area of underage girls although he will sniff out older women, even rape one.
I don't want trump anywhere close to this portrait.  President Biden should have the honor to place it in a prominent spot for all to see.

They won't. They never will. Majority of press want to keep him in power and will help normalize him and promote his narrative, just like 2016. US press has failed democracy. Watch how aggressive they become once Biden's in office, tho.

Oh he‚Äôs running the Democrats and Joe Biden.  We have Obama for another 4 years if Trump loses.  And all the crooks.  Think about that!
I just seen Biden is winning in 3 battle states. Just like 2016 all over again. I‚Äôve asked a ton of people if they‚Äôve been polled. Still haven‚Äôt met anyone who has for a federal election. I know I haven‚Äôt. Who is polling???
That makes me sick to my stomach hurt thinking these losers speaking at what fucking convention.  Hidin Biden?
Oh no! I am so frightened. I better start packing now. Vote for Joe Biden!

June 11, 2020  The National Pulse shows the donations made to Black Lives Matter actually go to ActBlue.  From there ActBlue takes those contributions and sends them forward to the Joe Biden Campaign.
It's not the only choice.  The Green party is offering progressives a platform from which to organize and force concessions from the D's and the R's. A progressive vote for Biden is a wasted vote. We won't get anything from him.
Bro have you seen what Biden‚Äôs America will look like!? It‚Äôs terrifying. /s
Obama/Biden was the worst administration in U.S. history. They are the reason you are able to kidnap civilians unconstitutionally by using the department of homeland security which should be abolished if we are to ever be free
They really did. I know I wasn't the only one that had an entire family/got laid off/lost my house during the housing market crash. Where was the help? He was bailing out banks.  Should that be brought up during a debate? I almost guarantee Biden doesn't even remember any of that
You sent troops to try to distract America‚Äôs attention, it won‚Äôt work. Biden is burying you, unemployment just went up again and you cheat at golf.
I‚Äôm dead though shit sounds like ‚ÄúJoe Biden‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
So... Where's you outrage when Obama and Biden were in the white house for 8 years and did nothing about police reform? Or prison reform? This is weak democrat leadership. Casualties don't matter to dems, obviously.
So now obama is both pivot man and clean up boy in Biden‚Äôs circle jerk?

They probably haven't had a reason to give Biden one.  They tend to only give those to folks they suspect something is going wrong with... dementia, Alzheimer's or stroke.Also, Biden did the cardinal sin by eliminating a gender by committing to picking a women ( which I am 100% for).
Biden did a great job creating jobs as part of the Obama administration.    Trump inherited a strong economy.
Biden widens lead?
Something fishy is going on. Biden is very quiet. Seems like he knows the election is in the bag. What does he and the Democrats doing?  Something smells fishy?
45 drops out at the last minute to give GOP boost in votes w/ Pence.   Maybe enough to beat a candidate like Biden who‚Äôs best attribute is that he‚Äôs better than 45  Barr charges Trump with all of his crimes, Pence pardons him allowing him to keep his stolen $ and stay out of jail
Two choices. Joe Biden is Nostradamus, which would be a good characteristic for a president, or Donald Trump is incredibly predictable anytime but particularly when backed into a corner.
As long as Biden demonstrates he can walk down a slight incline and drink water unaided, he‚Äôs doing okay
Add in top of this Biden‚Äôs soft ban through taxation of firearms and ‚Äúhigh capacity magazines‚Äù why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can‚Äôt delay the election. This is all talk eck.
Biden predicted in April that Trump would try to delay the election. April Response-Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh dismissed Biden's remarks Friday as "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Really now?

Totally agree.  Biden's weakness would embolden them.   Trump's relection means he no longer has to cow to the left.  He will bring the hammer down and end the nonsense. Plus the local democrats are going to get massacred as well so he will have local support to end the rioting.
So now  has run George Will to vote for Biden and our ultimate leader just told tRump to kiss his ass! #AmericaOrTrump

Trump WILL win if we are complacent or sit home and pout cause our favorite candidate didn‚Äôt get the nomination or write in names besides Biden.
The Fallout Over Biden Calling Trump a Racist: Why Now?
Great. Maybe you can drive your poll numbers even lower. Your TV appearances are a gift to Biden.
Proud of you. You‚Äôre finally listening to Biden!!!
Meanwhile....back in the sane world the Biden campaign has been planning a virtual convention for the last 4 months. Should be an interesting contrast.
Interesting.  I don‚Äôt think this is the stance you take if your goal is to be Biden‚Äôs VP.  This looks more like a long term play to move yourself in position to pick up the Bernie Bros.
Joe Biden actually believes Trump is the first "racist" US President? ü§¶How is there no one better than these two?
This is Biden's people acting like nutjobs. In case you were wondering.
Where is he then? Biden can't even take criticism from factory workers in an interview without losing his coolI hope all of these crooks get charged when Biden is President come Nov.
If happens I will encourage Mod Dems Independants NOT VOTE BIDEN FIND MOD OR INDEPENDANT WRITE IN CANDIDATE in defiance of accepting extremism in politics destroying voter equality
No, other than obama and biden
It is despicable. No quotes needed.
Is Trump Bluffing on Rx Drugs? Dems Must Act Fast to Find Out   Name of Independant this Liberal turned Mod Dem will write in if Biden picks Washington insider, extremist, or Caucasian for VP.
This Lib turned Mod dem WILL NOT VOTE BIDEN PICKS HER. EXCEPT for connection Obama admin lacks depth and experience. I'LL FIND INDEPENDENT OR MOD DEM write name on ballot.
Donnt have grudge I refuse support  Washinto insider or anyone with major baggage

This is Trump's America. Vote for Biden. Put your country over your party (if you are a Republican)..before its too late
This Mod Dem won't support Biden VP pick will determine if vote Dem or unaffiliated
Trump's old tricks aren't working  "asserted that Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wants to abolish ‚Äî  deep breath ‚Äî  police, Immigration 'n Customs Enforcement, the bail system, the second amendment, and intriguingly, the suburbs"
I call bullshit. Thats all you guys do is lie. It will end when Biden becomes President in Nov. Thank God .
I don't expect you to respond because what could you possibly say ? Its the truth . At least Biden wouldn't let Putin put a bounty on our soldiers head like Trump has.
The more of us who die the less votes for Biden.Your new poll doesn't state the obvious, how did you do the poll?   deserves better form Fox. #FakeNewsFOX
She is absolutely sane, and her theory of demonic possession is the best explanation ever for what has happened to the former Democrat party.  Just take a look at Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden's recent rants. #HowToExplainDemocrats
Here's Joe Biden's compaign strategy:
Would work for me!
If Trump wins will Biden concede? Probably Not! A National mail in ballot is risky, for those concerned with Covid request an absentee ballot, states can also open for early voting my State does this.
I guess Ed Rendell and Chris Dodd aren't thinking about what happens if Biden wins two terms. We need a strong v.p. to be ready in 8 years and  would be that v.p.
It's a shame you didn't win the nomination.  You are data driven and look at things logically.  Instead we are left with Biden and Trump. I'm a Republican so will vote anti-Trump, if you had won the nomination I would have voted for you and not just notTrump.
Thank you President Biden
Biden did a great job creating jobs as part of the Obama administration.    Trump inherited a strong economy.
You should ask all the states and Congress what they think about your ilea and they would all say your nuts! Also only Congress can change the Election Day. I will be so happy when Biden beats you. You are going to be a one term

I'll get a vaccine shot as soon as President Joe Biden's CDC and FDA certify it as being safe.
If Biden is elected, he will not last two minutes.  Don‚Äôt you see that his VP will immediately take over?
IF Biden is elected, he will not last two minutes before his VP takes over as president.  One way or another.  Is he pretending in competence, so that he does not have to die for his VP?
This idiot, Biden isn't 1/10th the man  Trump is, and  you know it! There is no chance Biden wins in a fair election. AND, that is why you intend to cheat with mail in voting! #GruberLibs
You see how much money I got on the catch?! I was thrilled. Biden is so jealous!
I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Obama was President.  I wonder if he been hanging around Biden too much and forgot he was the President for 8 years.
Classic BidenüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Despite what they claim, Democrats have no desire to return to "norms." Their goals under a Biden presidency will be to impose the most far-reaching liberal policies in history. They will do it by sheer brute force with no regard for "norms."
His suggestion came minutes after the Commerce Department announced that the nation‚Äôs GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced, fell 9.5 percent during the three months ending June 30, the largest quarterly drop on record.
Note to Biden - select  as your running mate.
Add in top of this Biden‚Äôs soft ban through taxation of firearms and ‚Äúhigh capacity magazines‚Äù why would any 2A advocate oppose Trump? He not trying to strip their rights or censor their speech. They know that he can‚Äôt delay the election. This is all talk eck.

White electorate in SC grew 112% and went overwhelmingly for biden. Believe what you want about extremely obvious things
South Carolina was a majority white dem primary electorate for the first time in 50 years due to Republicans coming en masse to vote for biden. Personally I think it's great that we're listening to Republicans and pretending it's black voices being heard
I‚Äôm also noticing a lot more desperation from demoratic socialists as well. Bashing Biden and the DNC while praising Trump...
Biden predicted in April that Trump would try to delay the election. April Response-Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh dismissed Biden's remarks Friday as "the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality."  Really now?
Kansas City suburban, white woman here voting for Biden!!  #SuburbsForBiden
Say it again, Joe. April 2020:  Biden accuses Trump of trying to delay election
Exactly. Biden supporters are now telling me that in addition to holding my nose and voting for his establishment plans, I just need to wait for his VP in four years. Then things will reallllly change.  ... I don't get it.
Now playing at a theater near you, "Weekend at Biden's."
Tucker warns 'fraud' Kamala Harris or 'unapologetic,' 'extreme' Karen Bass could run US if Biden wins
Gosh. When did we last have a VP who wasn't ambitious? Pence has ambitions of a cozy life deep in trump's ass. Biden clearly had ambitions. Cheney was a fucking megalomaniac. Gore wanted to be POTUS. So did Quayle. Why, this almost sounds like racist/misogynistic bullshit.
RBG  is a badass and I'm voting Biden and blue in honor of all badasses
It‚Äôs time that we all need to come together, Democrats and Republicans alike, in a bi-partisan effort for America. If you support Donald Trump, please drive with your headlights ON during the day. If you support Joe Biden, please drive with your lights OFF at night.
FFS Democrats are stupid and Kamala would make a much better president than Biden so yeah, as a very far left independent- this is exactly what I want.
Well he should‚Äôve been the nominee, mostly because of common sense stuff like this. But nooooooo we get Joe. Fucking. Biden. Well, it‚Äôs still better than the brainless orange lump.
Sean Hannity ramps up warnings of Biden presidency in new book, Fox Nation special
My friend lives in PA, in Philly, and he sees many Trump 2020 flags and signs everywhere. He says he sees 3 Biden signs out of 100 political flags of either Trump or Biden. And a majority of his friends are Trump supporters.
Every single one of his speeches does nothing but tell us what Biden plans to do and how it won't work. He has NO platform for himself
When are you starting with the big ad buys for Biden?
Illegal Immigration increases the crime. Good to know Biden loves crime
Opinion | Biden‚Äôs election will end national nightmare 2.0 - The Washington Post
What the "f" do U think Trump does? He has had no solutions ever for this country. His only plan is to win &amp; help the rich get richer the corrupt go free. He has destroyed everything this country stands for. Biden has many solutions &amp; they can work. Anything is better than Trump.
The headline means it's Trump 60 Biden 20 (3-to-1) but they're not "Obama voters" they're "Obama voters who voted for Trump in 16" which means anything less than 100% shows he's losing voters. And 20% are still undecided. Terrible headline.
Biden: I gonna blow out Trump!  Trump:
Looking forward to President Biden issuing blanket executive orders combating climate change, gun violence, and racial injustice.
Well there's that. üòâ At least as VP she can take a role in directing the DOJ and getting it back on solid ground. And I don't think there's a person in America who thinks Biden completes 4 years.
Biden will pardon all of them and blame Trump for going after political opponents. We waited too late.

Instead of repeatedly issuing carefully edited sound bites of Biden to make him look bad try issuing clips of Trump explaining what he will do if he wins a second term. It will be a slow day for you because Trump cannot articulate a single good reason to vote for him.
Biden has been talking tough on Russia past couple days.  What a joke.  He is the Obama Biden position.

joe biden openly has dementia, as anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear can tell. The best you can say about him is it probably isn't as bad as trump's
And he and his lobotomized minions harp that Biden has mental issues?
Oh, we will, pumpkin. We will vote for Joe Biden.
Fox News will assuredly make a bogeyman out of anyone Biden chooses.
Given that Obama and Biden literally laid the framework for this kind of federal escalation, with tear gas, abductions, and insane panopticon tracking of protestors back during Ferguson and Standing Rock?
Like. You're out right now supporting BLM and the protests, right? Do you think anything about the federal response is going to change under a Biden administration? Given what he's literally said? Given how the insane police responses came in uniparty controlled blue cities?
Personally, knowing I'll piss off cretins like that just solidifies my already made decision not to vote for the hateful wretch joe biden
Pay attention: August 1 announcement with a Biden quote.  Today is July 28.
Joe Biden can no longer remember what he had for lunch anymore
Hey moron, Joe admitted he cannot do two things at once! #GruberLibs
Biden is an idiot. Btw, that's not what happened. The Media has been lying about it, because they don't want to admit a Church was burned down, mere yards from the White House. Joe can't do two things at once.
More proof, Joe can't do two things at once. #GruberFools
Real Fact: Trump said he would enact Defense Production Act but didn‚Äôt until AFTER Biden pressed him multiple times. Trump says a lot of things that don‚Äôt actually happen until after he is forced to act.
I‚Äôll fix it: Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign will pick Joe Biden‚Äôs running mate next week.
He doesn't even know he's Joe Biden, and running for POTUS, not Senate.  #GruberLibs
Biden doesn‚Äôt even know where the Marlins play.
Biden taking questions from a list of people already pre picked (softballs)
they had eight years to do anything and did not, and beyond that the roots of what happened can be traced beyond the bush years; intentional choices from the clinton era, and legislation written by literally joe biden in the mid 2000s with republicans, deserve the credit.

maybe jill biden knows. I'm pretty sure joe biden doesn't know what he had for breakfast, much less who his proxy president will be
Trump is definitely NOT the answer, he is the disease and Biden is the cure.
Love that baby!  He‚Äôs a BIDEN fan!
I am so happy for Tuesday‚Äôs primary here in the Midwest where I will go mark my paper ballot for BIDEN!  My brother-in- law is having trouble getting registered in Arkansas so I only have to cancel out my sisters vote!
You mean Biden, right
Joe Biden knows he can't win and the media and DEMS know it too.  They are so desperate
Read the tweet. Stop blindly firing. He‚Äôs taking Trump‚Äôs side and bashing Biden once again.
So you like Trump more than Biden just like your daddy?
Oh my flipping Lord.  First not a Moderate second I doubt Joe can even color a coloring book.
Presented by the Biden campaign
Well, it's not up to him to decide if he's leaving. If Biden is declared the Presidential winner, Trump will leave on Jan 20, 2021 or he will be escorted out of the People's House.
If you are to believe Trump, the world will burn if Biden is elected. Problem is we all know what 4 years of Biden looks like, which was peaceful and awesome.
Without a doubt!  A vote for Biden is a vote for Antifa/BLM.
You think the rioters are Biden voters?  If Biden wins,  it'll be because he peeled off enough independents and centrist Republican voters, not because he won over the rioters?
BIDEN losers wake up
I‚Äôm actually a bit concerned with Minnesota      Several polls have shown it with a similar margin  and it was only +1.5 for Hillary. It‚Äôs concerning that it‚Äôs lagging behind WI, MI, and PA for Biden. Hopefully it won‚Äôt matter with gains in AZ and FL
We are trying. Electing Joe Biden on November 3rd will move us in the right direction.
So I assume Joe Biden supports  being on the Presidential debate stage, so she can fully participate in our country
you know what's divisive? deciding my friends should die for donor profits. Why should I care about the democrats or joe biden when they obviously do not care if I live or die?
It has to be Michelle. Biden is very weak and needs someone else to carry this through.
Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer are like the Dallas Cowboys, too many years of failure, yet are given ample opportunities, and always accomplish nothing. And are a ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN!
Agreed.   Plus they have a reputation of being one of the most pragmatic voting demos and less concerned with identity politics.  Supporting Clinton over Obama until he had a path and this year finding it less important than whites that Biden choose a black running mate.
Still saying it ? Haven‚Äôt you had almost 4 years of making it great ? Biden‚Äôs slogan should be clean the toilet bowl ( one up drain the swamp ) #yourealoser

Biden could simply support m4a and get our support instead, you know
Still not gonna vote for biden unless he supports real universal care
The president‚Äôs catastrophic handling of the virus has destroyed the economy and led to the needless deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. I look forward to President Biden‚Äôs new UNCHECKED EXECUTIVE POWER to fix this problem and hold trump and his cronies accountable.
Chris Dodd should not be asked to quit the Biden campaign. He should be fired.
Maybe he just claims Russia supports Biden and starts off all kinds of investigations and threatens any of his personal friends. Nah, this has been done already.
She‚Äôs the only reasonable option under the circumstances. Biden is so weak.
I kept getting these even though I tried to "unsubscribe" about a dozen times.  Eventually, I responded and wrote that I was going to give $100 to Biden for every text I got after that.  Haven't seen one in about 3 weeks.
Staying away from press conferences seems to be a winning strategy. Look at Biden‚Äôs poll numbers. Trump is on TV and Twitter constantly making statements to the press. Look at Trump‚Äôs poll numbers. If you want Trumpy to win you‚Äôre going to have to gag him.
Not a single thing about these federal responses will change under biden. This playbook was literally built under him before at Ferguson and standing rock. The protests won't stop until police power is stripped. The protests will continue, and so will the federal brutality.
Thread.  I hope  realizes that this Chris Dodd isn't looking out for his best interests or OURS.  Biden needs a strong, smart woman as his VP. Not a yes woman.  Don't relegate the first female VP in the U.S. to a title only.  #WomenareWatching,  !
I cannot think of any job that Joe Biden could do.   Walmart would fire him if he was a greeter.  Maybe for sniffing the hair of the customers when they come in the door?
I like Walter.   Biden no.
Biden: ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not Hispanic if you vote for...‚Äù #YouKnowTheThing
After about 20 ‚Äúunsubscribe‚Äù replies, I finally told them that I was donating $100 to Biden for each additional text. It‚Äôs been almost 3 weeks.
Biden is sitting quietly watching Trump self-destruct. And, unlike you and Trumpy, he‚Äôs not standing behind a podium at the White House lying to the American people.
One overwhelming reason to vote FOR Biden: he‚Äôs not Trump!
I think Biden struggles to find his car keys now days.
The Democrats chose Biden. Politicians don't have to be rock stars. I'll take a game manager over a gun slinger.
Counterpoint: Biden is absolutely not an idiot. To even entertain this thought shows you gave not been paying attention, and/or don't care how the consequences of elections affect others because you'll be fine either way.
Against fracking?  That gives my vote to Biden.
Biden is in the basement bunker, you got it wrong. Trump has been out every day this past week, but nice try.
Still 300 miles remain and Joe Biden is still suck in the basement.
For a network that gaslights, lies and fear mongers for a #FascistRegime? #45 us a Traitor and Fox props him up. Biden owes this network NOTHING
These protests aren't going to end because Joe biden becomes president. And don't delude yourself; the insane brutal federal actions won't stop because he's in charge of them, either.

Anyone but Michelle Obama brings more liabilities than assets to the ticket. All the other choices will immediately begin major erosion of Biden‚Äôs support without adding much enthusiasm.

There has been thewhole idea that Russia/Putin is controlling him, and that there is some blackmail out there. The Maxwell comments definitely didn't help. My understanding is that Biden will raise interest rates back up to help fight inflation. 280 char isn't enough right now

If you are not voting FOR Biden, then, whatever you do, you are supporting Trump's re-election.

Biden says Charlamagne tha God was 'baiting' him, which prompted 'you ain't black' remark"I'm not a pedophile I'm just voting for one." The right can say the same shit about the left. I don't get why we continue to rip Trump like Biden is any better. Both are horrible individuals that SHOULDN'T even be running for president.
So are you ready to jump in the race to help your party? I‚Äôm sure you can handle losing 3 times. Twice to Trump. Nobody will go for the Biden/Harris ticket tho. Only you can save the day. You need to do it before your court date on Sept.9th tho.

It‚Äôs funny how he and his family have spent so much time saying Biden isn‚Äôt all there, yet Trump‚Äôs the one taking the cognitive tests and defending his own mental agility.
Johnson is hard on Biden but he wants everyone to forget what he called black women on a radio show interview. That was most likely the reason we didn‚Äôt see him on MSNBC for a while.
He did the same thing to HC. And from the beginning of the re-election campaign, he‚Äôs been saying Trump was going to win and without a doubt Biden will lose. Maybe he‚Äôs trying to help prove himself right.
Get over it. Stop trying to make yourself relevant on the back of Biden.
From day one you said Trump would win re-election. You said it constantly. You dogged on Biden everyday saying he could never win. You dogged on HC and did your part to suppress the black vote. Now you‚Äôre on to Obama. Why don‚Äôt you be a leader instead of a whiner? Getting old.Breaking: Sen Harris is going to be selected as the VP choice for Biden!
Let's say some foreign information meant to damage Biden comes out. It will most definitely be some innocuous normal scandal that would barely make a blip in government circles but this administration will make it out to be the biggest political scandal ever. Don't fall for it.
two sets of rules - we need to get into the ruling class to get jobs like hunter biden
Then do what the Obama/Biden team did. Quit testing!!
None of these words mean anything. Antifa-themed? Black and red? Is checkers antifa-themed? Holy shit. Please don‚Äôt say any more scary words. Also, do they know who Biden is? He has a long history of not being leftist.
Exactly, Biden should go away!
You promise to repeal and replace all you did was repeal so that makes you worse than Biden or any other former presidential official ever in the world. Mr. Comrade mashed potato head Trump
Republicans have disdain for working Americans, is that so Nancy, What about Billy NAFTA and China Biden, they killed middle class American jobs!
joe biden campaign mantra - he sniffed her hair too
how can anyone think biden is capable -
Biden will get a million billion. Or I mean a trillion million votes by mail
Unless they do mail in‚Äôs. Then Biden might have a million billion
Is Biden speaking at the funeral today? Is he even there?
shows how ignorant he truly is every time he calls it the "China Virus". What a mess this dick is leaving for Biden to clean up!
POTUS already planting the seeds of contesting the election if he loses. This is why we have to make sure Biden wins by an overwhelming margin so there is zero doubt who the people have elected.
I‚Äôm sure it helps Biden that he‚Äôs been involved in something like this before. They passed along a playbook and a team of people to Trump administration it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard for Biden to get that set up again/
Joe Biden is a pathological liar, he will turn on the far left within moments after elected, praying that never happens. He represents the most pathetic politician and candidate ever to be nominated for President!
Or what? Vote Trump? It‚Äôs obvious to me Joe Biden can take us down a path to clam..we won‚Äôt have constant worry everyday..we won‚Äôt have an idiot in the WH..if that‚Äôs not enough to vote for him..then vote for your buddy in the WH..
Biden defended the violent federal anarchist mob that attacked Portland???  That's news to me.
Watch Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, break down what a Biden administration would have done differently and what we would do now to get this virus under control
I'm volunteering for Joe Biden on the Vote Joe App. It only takes a few minutes‚Äìcheck it out!
I'm volunteering for Joe Biden on the Vote Joe App. It only takes a few minutes‚Äìcheck it out!
Watch Biden's remarks on how he's mobilizing a 21st century care and early childhood education workforce to deal with the caregiving crisis in our nation.
Your voters know this very well- it's the other side that are blind as bats. Mr. President we cannot in any way shape or form let Biden win. There is no way he can win legitimately, you're the best, but the far left will cheat up a storm, as you already know. üá∫üá∏
She needs to get over Sanders not being the nominee and support Biden. The other option is Trump and Barr.. what will she do?
Biden is a good man.. Enough said .. if your such a proud socialist..support this man and perhaps you might be surprised what gets done. The other option for you is Trump .. What will you do?
Biden will give us an opportunity to get back on the right path. He will work with Sanders. I‚Äôd rather have 4 years of peace and kindness .. The VP is an important pick..Show some support for Biden .. we need everyone
Love love ...Biden 2020
üòØ....but this is basically the same as when Joe Biden said "you ain't black"
Future news: ‚ÄúJoe Biden single handedly cures Covid-19 on day one as President.   #WakeUp
And Biden is better? You‚Äôre the one who hasn‚Äôt been paying attention...
If Biden wins COVID-19 will suddenly disappear from the headlines. If Trump wins it will stick around like a bad virus.
Biden and Trump are child molesters
Joe Biden and Donald Trump are child molesters
Look for it to get worse if your vote causes Biden to win.
This is the single most telling news statistic I have read about the up coming Presidential election. Joe Biden‚Äôs bunker didn‚Äôt even make the poll, but obviously he is positioned wel tonsurvive the virus and win the election.
Portland‚Äôs mayor is white and he‚Äôs even worse than she is. I‚Äôm telling you man, all this bullshit going on in Chicago, Portland, Seattle are setting bad precedents. If Biden gets elected all of those cities are fucked, they are legit done. Those cities need real leadership
Ok so lemme ask this. How do you explain how George Soros has made over 2mill in kick back from the BLM donations? Joe Biden campaign has made over 30 mill.. so it‚Äôs really just Democrat‚Äôs&amp; millions pedophiles who finically gain of black peoples struggle.. AGAIN
What the fuck is wrong with you? You‚Äôll vote for someone who can‚Äôt learn, is forcing kids back to school in the middle of a pandemic, doesn‚Äôt believe his own intelligence etc etc etc over the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù choice of Biden? I‚Äôm calling BS on you ever voting blue.
So every Republican and the Republican party boats by mail so they‚Äôre all committing fraud lock them up let‚Äôs round them all up! I‚Äôm down gets them all out of the swamp clean out the swamp that include your precious little president snowflake! Biden 2020 baby!
But the only way the little snowflake can win is by getting everybody to use the touchscreens. How was he supposed to win? Biden 2020!
"Sniffs" the Joe Biden story told from staff members. Each had to use a different shampoo he would spend hours guessing the brand.
Hey.  Kansas downballot campaigns.  How would you like to have a great social media op with Biden's signs across America event?  Hit up my DM to learn more.
Interestingly, if Trump was wise, he‚Äôd do everything he can to stay out of the news so the media has to focus on Biden.  But he‚Äôs an attention whore, so that won‚Äôt happen. üòÇ
Letting Trump stay front and center is working for him, so I don‚Äôt really see the benefit.  Quite a bit of that vote isn‚Äôt voting for Biden, but against Trump, so his best strategy is to let Trump ruin himself.  This year, the media‚Äôs obsession with Trump is working against him.
I gotta joe Biden joke where did I hear it from again? What was it ? Uhhhhh uhhhhh
It‚Äôs not too late to do the right thing..VoteJoe Biden #WakeUpAmerica
you should have someone read Biden's platform to you, slowly.  No one here actually believes you have enough competency in English to do so, comrade.
And this is the moment   told joe Biden that he has to pick her as VP because he can‚Äôt win without her! #BidenHarris2020 #bidenharris
JOE BIDEN WILL NOT DEFUND THE POLICE.  DONALD TRUMP IS JUST LYING TO YOU AGAIN.

Haha!!  There's a reason Biden isn't having rallies and seen out and it has nothing to do with Covid ü§£ Nobody cares about the guy who let's little kids rub his legs in the swimming pool.  Fucking Chomo.
And I want cinnamon Hitler in jail. For lying treason tax evasion and probably a whole string of other crimes that we don‚Äôt even know about yet!
Oh shit #cinnamonHitler I got more proof! look at that google actually works! why don‚Äôt you try reading something and stop watching Fox News.
Just think if Biden wins the election Covid 19 will end on 11/4/20 If Trump wins it wil go on until the American people rise up and quit being sheep!
Ha!  Nothing will be released before the election and it will all be swept away when Biden wins.
This map is so interesting.  Surprising #Kansas Biden donors: Lebo/Olivet Lindsborg Ansdale Parsons Edgerton
having lost to President-Elect Hillary Clinton by 65 MILLION votes, no.  You're only there because Putin bankrolled your failed campaign.  But thanks for campaigning and fundraising for Joe Biden, the DNC and all Democratic/American candidates!  We really appreciate the support!
He always has! U should come up with something better then that #traitor #Biden #Obama #DumpTrump2020 #CinnamonHitler #cinnamonbun #cheetodustisoutofhere
Imagine twitter sgowing its leftist tendencies when it decides not to diacuss how Obama and Biden Colluded in 2016 to stop Trump from getting elected. Great job twitter. Obama and Biden are Scum.
Fake, fake, fake, xenophobic, news! So dumb. This is so not true. Stop trying ur never gonna keep up with a winner! #Biden #Biden2020Landslide #DumpTrump2020 #DumpTrump #cinnamonbun #cinnamonhitler #LoserTrump
What year do you think it is? Bro, women be out there earning bread. It‚Äôs 2020 man, a woman beat you by 3 million votes and she‚Äôs from the same party as Joe Biden. You‚Äôre in trouble, you out of touch, arrogant prick.
Democrats/Americans want to thank you for all the hard work you're doing to campaign and raise funds for our soon-to-be-elected forty-fifth President Joe Biden!  Your endorsement has given Democrats/Americans more than A THOUSAND election wins nationwide!  KEEP IT UP!
Thank you Joe Biden for your knowledge of current events . You keep America up to date when the WH resident is still reviewing his cognitive test on national tv.
Biden wants to be the second.
